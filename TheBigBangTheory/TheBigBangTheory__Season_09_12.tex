1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Well, there was this girl.\\
3 - What did you do?\\
4 - Nothing.\\
5 - Really, it was just kissing.\\
6 - (sighs)\\
7 - All right.\\
8 - So, we're still getting married?\\
9 - Yes.\\
10 - Because we love each other.\\
11 - Yes.\\
12 - And it's the happiest day of our life.\\
13 - (chuckles) Don't push it.\\
14 - I need some time to take a step back and reevaluate our situation.\\
15 - Oh.\\
16 - Bye, Sheldon.\\
17 - Well, Gollum... you're an expert on rings.\\
18 - What do I do with this one?\\
19 - So, what package are you thinking?\\
20 - Mm, this one comes with music and flowers.\\
21 - Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.\\
22 - Why would we want that?\\
23 - 'Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist.\\
24 - Let's give them hope.\\
25 - Whatever. Put us on the Internet.\\
26 - I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section.\\
27 - I-If you're not into this, we can do it another time.\\
28 - No. No, I want to.\\
29 - Look, we've put this off long enough.\\
30 - Let's do it.\\
31 - Aw.\\
32 - That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.\\
33 - (ringtone playing)\\
34 - Oh, excuse me.\\
35 - Sheldon.\\
36 - Hey.\\
37 - Leonard, have you gotten married yet?\\
38 - No. Why?\\
39 - Good. Don't do it!\\
40 - Why not?\\
41 - Some important new information has come to light.\\
42 - Women are the worst.\\
43 - I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong.\\
44 - No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.\\
45 - What happened now?\\
46 - Amy has ended our relationship.\\
47 - Oh, no. Seriously?\\
48 - What's going on?\\
49 - Amy broke up with Sheldon.\\
50 - She did?\\
51 - Is Penny crying?\\
52 - No.\\
53 - No, of course not.\\
54 - They thrive on our suffering.\\
55 - Buddy, I-I'm so sorry.\\
56 - Is there anything I can do?\\
57 - Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.\\
58 - Sheldon, uh, o-okay, just because you're going through this with Amy doesn't mean that all women are bad.\\
59 - Whatever.\\
60 - Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?\\
61 - Not really.\\
62 - Can you come over?\\
63 - Uh, actually I'm in Vegas.\\
64 - Leonard and I are about to get married.\\
65 - Hold on.\\
66 - You're getting married and you didn't invite me?\\
67 - Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.\\
68 - Wow.\\
69 - Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.\\
70 - Amy, don't be like that.\\
71 - Why did I just hear Amy's name?\\
72 - Penny's on the phone with her.\\
73 - Did she say anything about me?\\
74 - Never mind. I don't care.\\
75 - Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me.\\
76 - Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.\\
77 - Okay, will you relax?\\
78 - You're not missing anything special.\\
79 - Hey.\\
80 - She's upset.\\
81 - Look, it's gonna be a great wedding.\\
82 - Look at you in your little suit.\\
83 - Amy's upset? Is it about me?\\
84 - No, I think it's because we're eloping.\\
85 - Your marriage is causing her pain?\\
86 - Yeah, great, I take it back.\\
87 - Go ahead and do it.\\
88 - Yay for love!\\
89 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
90 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
91 -  The Earth began to cool \\
92 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
93 -  We built the Wall \\
94 -  We built the pyramids \\
95 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
96 -  That all started with a big bang \\
97 -  Bang! \\
98 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x01 \\
99 - The Matrimonial Momentum\\
100 - Original Air Date on September 21\\
101 - Hello.\\
102 - Oh!\\
103 - What are you doing here?\\
104 - When last we spoke, you said you needed time.\\
105 - Well, it's only been 11 hours.\\
106 - The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours.\\
107 - I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.\\
108 - Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk, I'll let you know.\\
109 - Very well.\\
110 - You seem to be headed somewhere.\\
111 - May I walk with you?\\
112 - Sure.\\
113 - Boy, I'm glad we're going out again.\\
114 - We're not back together.\\
115 - Why?\\
116 - Is there someone else?\\
117 - Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?\\
118 - If you must know, I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.\\
119 - And who's this guy you're taking?\\
120 - There's no guy!\\
121 - Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?\\
122 - That's sad.\\
123 - I'm not gonna be alone.\\
124 - I'll be with my friends.\\
125 - Your friends?\\
126 - Well, I think you mean my friends.\\
127 - And why wasn't I invited to this?\\
128 - Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.\\
129 - We make everyone feel awkward.\\
130 - That's our thing!\\
131 - They're running a little behind.\\
132 - Should be pretty soon.\\
133 - Okay.\\
134 - Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.\\
135 - Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.\\
136 - I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay.\\
137 - Look, it-it's not how I pictured it either, but I'm still glad we're doing it.\\
138 - Me, too.\\
139 - You sure?\\
140 - Yes.\\
141 - And you promise you're okay with everything from the car?\\
142 - Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?\\
143 - You're right.\\
144 - I'm sorry.\\
145 - We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it.\\
146 - So what do you think?\\
147 - Should we run next door and grab a bite?\\
148 - What if they call our names?\\
149 - Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.\\
150 - Oh, and the fairy tale continues.\\
151 - Thank you for doing this.\\
152 - Our pleasure.\\
153 - You feeling okay?\\
154 - We were together for so long, I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.\\
155 - Well, that's understandable.\\
156 - You forgot.\\
157 - It's called "happy."\\
158 - Howard.\\
159 - I'm not saying anything bad.\\
160 - Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.\\
161 - I know what you're going through.\\
162 - My-my last breakup was pretty tough.\\
163 - Oh. What was her name?\\
164 - Hey, it's a true story.\\
165 - I don't need the third degree.\\
166 - (gasps)\\
167 - For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?\\
168 - I didn't want to come in.\\
169 - I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.\\
170 - So I'll just stay out here and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom.\\
171 - Howard, do something.\\
172 - I'm on it.\\
173 - Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.\\
174 - I see.\\
175 - And is that why everybody was invited but me?\\
176 - They didn't invite everybody but you.\\
177 - Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.\\
178 - (singsongy): Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?\\
179 - So, when you hear the music, that's your cue.\\
180 - Any questions?\\
181 - Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.\\
182 - Where are the rose petals?!\\
183 - Woman: We're out!\\
184 - You know what? It's fine.\\
185 - Woman: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!\\
186 - Really, we're good. (chuckles)\\
187 - Yup, just want to get married.\\
188 - Yeah.\\
189 - Great.\\
190 - I'll see you two up there.\\
191 - This is it.\\
192 - I know.\\
193 - I love you.\\
194 - I love you, too.\\
195 - Woman: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?!\\
196 - No, thank you!\\
197 - We're good!\\
198 - (string instruments playing "Bridal Chorus")\\
199 - Raj, you're probably wondering why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.\\
200 - Didn't even crack the top ten.\\
201 - Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.\\
202 - I said I needed time to think.\\
203 - I'm sure you guys will figure something out.\\
204 - You hear that?\\
205 - Raj is devastated.\\
206 - Sheldon, shh.\\
207 - The wedding's starting.\\
208 - I see what's happening.\\
209 - Sides are forming.\\
210 - Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.\\
211 - I'm not taking sides.\\
212 - Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.\\
213 - Really?\\
214 - At least you got picked.\\
215 - Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?\\
216 - Yes.\\
217 - No.\\
218 - You wrote vows?\\
219 - Yeah.\\
220 - Well, I don't have any.\\
221 - You're kind of making me look bad.\\
222 - It's okay. I-I don't have to say them.\\
223 - No, no, no, go ahead.\\
224 - I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry, we got this.\\
225 - "Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms traveled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."\\
226 - Wow.\\
227 - Penny?\\
228 - Right. Um... okay.\\
229 - (chuckles)\\
230 - Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life.\\
231 - I mean, you're my best friend, and... you've got a friend in me.\\
232 - You got troubles.\\
233 - I got 'em, too.\\
234 - There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.\\
235 - We stick together, and we can see it through, 'cause... you've got a friend in me.\\
236 - Is that the song from Toy Story?\\
237 - He loves that movie.\\
238 - (voice breaking): I do.\\
239 - Aw, that was beautiful.\\
240 - Yeah.\\
241 - I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.\\
242 - No, we totally won.\\
243 - Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not?\\
244 - It's like you can't make up your mind.\\
245 - It's because you're not giving me any space to think.\\
246 - Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.\\
247 - You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy.\\
248 - You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face.\\
249 - I don't need any more time to think. We're broken up.\\
250 - Amy...\\
251 - Will someone take me home?\\
252 - Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.\\
253 - Minister: ...symbolizes your eternal love. I now pronounce you husband and wife.\\
254 - We did it!\\
255 - I'm so glad you guys could watch!\\
256 - We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section.\\
257 - No, no, no. Hang on.\\
258 - I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.\\
259 - Can you?\\
260 - Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?\\
261 - Okay, let's do it.\\
262 - (sighs)\\
263 - (grunts)\\
264 - (grunting softly)\\
265 - You gonna make it?\\
266 - I'm okay!\\
267 - (grunts)\\
268 - (both chuckle)\\
269 - Nicely done!\\
270 - Thank you. (chuckles)\\
271 - Finally, there's a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn't disappointed in me.\\
272 - Well, the night is still young.\\
273 - (chuckles)\\
274 - Everything all right?\\
275 - Yeah. I guess.\\
276 - Just tell me.\\
277 - It's just, when we were kissing, I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.\\
278 - Oh, no.\\
279 - No, come on.\\
280 - I have a friend in you.\\
281 - You said so.\\
282 - You're right.\\
283 - Just forget it.\\
284 - (chuckles) Yeah.\\
285 - Okay, listen. Uh...\\
286 - If you're imagining that it was sexy, it wasn't.\\
287 - We-we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray.\\
288 - The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.\\
289 - Did you feel guilty?\\
290 - No, she had dental insurance.\\
291 - Did you feel guilty after kissing her?\\
292 - Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened.\\
293 - I feel guilty every time I see her.\\
294 - What do you mean, every time you see her?\\
295 - What... do I mean?\\
296 - Boy, that's a toughie.\\
297 - You still see her?\\
298 - Well, no, not socially.\\
299 - But, you know, just at work.\\
300 - You work with her?!\\
301 - (groans)\\
302 - How could you not tell me that?!\\
303 - I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking!\\
304 - Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?\\
305 - No, of course not.\\
306 - (stammers) Okay, l-look, instead of fighting, why don't we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby?\\
307 - I was trying to lighten the mood.\\
308 - It's not easy. You try it.\\
309 - Hello, Mother.\\
310 - Shelly! How's my baby doing?\\
311 - I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers.\\
312 - Unless you're open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.\\
313 - Oh, what's going on?\\
314 - She broke up with me.\\
315 - Oh, Shelly.\\
316 - No, I'll be okay.\\
317 - But I think that I'd like to send the ring back to you.\\
318 - Well, let's not be hasty.\\
319 - Are you sure it's over for good?\\
320 - It's over for me. I'm done with women.\\
321 - Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.\\
322 - They both hurt you on purpose.\\
323 - You want to tell me what happened?\\
324 - Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?\\
325 - Good chance.\\
326 - Then no, thank you.\\
327 - Well, honey, don't send it back yet.\\
328 - Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.\\
329 - Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?\\
330 - When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.\\
331 - I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better.\\
332 - Yeah.\\
333 - Everything's gonna be okay.\\
334 - You've got so much to offer.\\
335 - Thank you.\\
336 - Any man would be lucky to have you.\\
337 - That's true.\\
338 - I just hope I did the right thing.\\
339 - I'm sure you did.\\
340 - Maybe that's the problem-- you always do the right thing.\\
341 - Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.\\
342 - Like you're doing right now?\\
343 - Exactly.\\
344 - I asked you over and over if you were okay.\\
345 - Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?\\
346 - I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.\\
347 - Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift!\\
348 - Wow!\\
349 - Well, marriage must agree with you.\\
350 - Well, you are just glowing.\\
351 - I'm not glowing.\\
352 - I'm upset.\\
353 - Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.\\
354 - Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?\\
355 - What's this?\\
356 - Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.\\
357 - Oh. That's so sweet of you.\\
358 - Yeah. I know.\\
359 - Turns out, being sweet isn't enough to keep a girl these days.\\
360 - I blame Madonna.\\
361 - I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.\\
362 - Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.\\
363 - Thought I raised him better than that.\\
364 - You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.\\
365 - He does? Who is it?\\
366 - (scoffs) Some girl named Mandy.\\
367 - Mandy Chao?\\
368 - Yeah.\\
369 - Oh, you don't need to worry about her.\\
370 - She's brilliant and attractive.\\
371 - She can do way better than Leonard.\\
372 - That's great.\\
373 - (clears throat)\\
374 - Wait a minute.\\
375 - I know this may sound farfetched, but I'm on the market now.\\
376 - You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.\\
377 - That's ridiculous.\\
378 - Oh, you're right.\\
379 - I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard.\\
380 - I'm with Leonard.\\
381 - Yeah, I know. Forever.\\
382 - (sighs)\\
383 - Who would have believed these things would happen to us?\\
384 - Right? (scoffs)\\
385 - I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.\\
386 - Hang on.\\
387 - You knew that she was going to end it with me?\\
388 - Did you try and stop her?\\
389 - I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.\\
390 - Do what makes her happy?\\
391 - She plays the harp and her car is paid for.\\
392 - How much happier can she be?\\
393 - Okay, look, it's not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.\\
394 - I see.\\
395 - Well...\\
396 - I think I'll be going.\\
397 - Sheldon...\\
398 - No, no, no, no.\\
399 - We are done here.\\
400 - (sighs)\\
401 - Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?\\
402 - Sure.\\
403 - Thank you.\\
404 - And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.\\
405 - All right, Leonard, hang in there.\\
406 - Talk to you tomorrow.\\
407 - What happened?\\
408 - They just got married.\\
409 - (sighs) I don't know.\\
410 - It's a mess.\\
411 - They had a huge fight in Vegas.\\
412 - Think they'll break up?\\
413 - I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.\\
414 - Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.\\
415 - Really?\\
416 - Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?\\
417 - Sure, let's make it an even hundred.\\
418 - You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you" and then break up with me.\\
419 - I wouldn't.\\
420 - And you know why?\\
421 - 'Cause you're a man.\\
422 - The champagne of genders.\\
423 - Well, I may be a man, but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.\\
424 - Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.\\
425 - All you hear women say is, "I'll just have a salad."\\
426 - You know?\\
427 - "Where's my lip gloss?"\\
428 - "I think this element should be called radium."\\
429 - That last one was Madame Curie.\\
430 - I figured that out.\\
431 - You know what? She was kind of an honorary man.\\
432 - She had a pen1s made of science.\\
433 - Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.\\
434 - Really?\\
435 - I never imagined it any other way.
\subsection {Episode 02: The Separation Oscillation}
1 - Why are you up?\\
2 - How am I supposed to sleep?\\
3 - I've been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn't speaking to me.\\
4 - Perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light.\\
5 - In one day, you've managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.\\
6 - (knocking on door)\\
7 - Hi.\\
8 - Hey.\\
9 - You couldn't sleep either?\\
10 - Of course not.\\
11 - Me neither.\\
12 - But I just had a tickle in my throat.\\
13 - Not profound marital problems.\\
14 - What are we gonna do?\\
15 - I don't know.\\
16 - Please, tell me how I can fix it.\\
17 - Glad you asked.\\
18 - As I see it, there's a simple solution.\\
19 - Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman.\\
20 - It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him.\\
21 - And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.\\
22 - Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\\
23 - Actually, I think he's onto something.\\
24 - Y-You can't be serious.\\
25 - 'Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you're gonna do the same with a random guy?\\
26 - I'm currently single.\\
27 - That's true. You are.\\
28 - What is happening?!\\
29 - I will tell you what is happening.\\
30 - I am saving my best friend's marriage.\\
31 - (gasps)\\
32 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
33 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
34 -  The Earth began to cool \\
35 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
36 -  We built the Wall \\
37 -  We built the pyramids \\
38 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
39 -  That all started with a big bang \\
40 -  Bang! \\

42 - <font color=#00FFFF>The Separation Oscillation</font>\\
43 - (Skype ringing)\\
44 - Sheldon, I don't think you understand how being broken up works.\\
45 - The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us.\\
46 - Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me.\\
47 - I go through the pain all over again.\\
48 - Well, hello to you, too.\\
49 - What do you want?\\
50 - I understand we're no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.\\
51 - What baby?\\
52 - A precocious little Internet show known as "Fun With Flags."\\
53 - I'm hanging up.\\
54 - Great. See you in about half an hour.\\
55 - Sheldon, I am not doing "Fun With Flags" with you.\\
56 - Why not?\\
57 - Because we're broken up.\\
58 - Sonny and Cher made it work.\\
59 - Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.\\
60 - No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.\\
61 - You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, 'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.\\
62 - Sheldon, this has to stop.\\
63 - I know it's hard.\\
64 - It's hard for me, too.\\
65 - But I've seen and talked to you more in the two days we've been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.\\
66 - Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.\\
67 - I can't believe you made out with Mandy Chao.\\
68 - Trust me, I wish it never happened.\\
69 - And you knew about this this whole time?\\
70 - I did.\\
71 - And you didn't think to tell me?\\
72 - Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.\\
73 - Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment.\\
74 - This is about you and me.\\
75 - Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?\\
76 - Hang on.\\
77 - What do I need to do to make you trust me?\\
78 - You think it's hard having one wife, try having two.\\
79 - I bet you told Bernadette all about he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.\\
80 - Oh, we didn't screw around.\\
81 - We just got drunk and made out.\\
82 - Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.\\
83 - What are you doing here?\\
84 - I'm here to return your belongings.\\
85 - That's what people who've broken up do.\\
86 - And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.\\
87 - On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities.\\
88 - We're not friends with benefits.\\
89 - Just give me the box.\\
90 - W-Wait. Don't you want to go through it to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?\\
91 - Fine.\\
92 - My old scarf.\\
93 - You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?\\
94 - You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail Googling the symptoms of hypothermia?\\
95 - We made one heck of a team, huh?\\
96 - Whose bra is this?\\
97 - It's not yours?\\
98 - Oh, my.\\
99 - How embarrassing for both of us.\\
100 - It's Penny's.\\
101 - Hey, you broke up with me.\\
102 - It is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.\\
103 - Good-bye.\\
104 - Amy.\\
105 - Amy. Amy.\\
106 - (sighs)\\
107 - Hmm. Tables work, too.\\
108 - Good to know.\\
109 - Ooh, brownies for girls' night!\\
110 - Hands off. I'm mad at you.\\
111 - (sighs)\\
112 - Look, I know it's a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.\\
113 - What will pay for itself?\\
114 - Doesn't matter.\\
115 - What are you mad about?\\
116 - I'm mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I'm mad that I've had to hide this from Penny for two years.\\
117 - And you have every right to be mad about those things.\\
118 - So, why don't you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh?\\
119 - I mean, don't even look at it.\\
120 - I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this time and haven't told her, she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend.\\
121 - I wish you never told me.\\
122 - And I wish Leonard never told me.\\
123 - He's the bad guy here.\\
124 - I guess that's true.\\
125 - And you let Penny marry him.\\
126 - (scoffs)\\
127 - Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?\\
128 - Hi. I'm calling about your marriage counseling services and was curious what your rate is.\\
129 - Really?\\
130 - Um, okay.\\
131 - Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage?\\
132 - 'Cause we're just talking hours here.\\
133 - Hi.\\
134 - Call you back.\\
135 - Hey.\\
136 - Can we talk?\\
137 - I would love that.\\
138 - All right, look, I'm sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married.\\
139 - I hate that we're going through this, but I don't know what to do.\\
140 - If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counseling.\\
141 - Hello.\\
142 - Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?\\
143 - Oh, of course.\\
144 - Wouldn't want to intrude.\\
145 - This is yours.\\
146 - Okay, when I'm done with him, I'm gonna need more information.\\
147 - Nothing odd.\\
148 - I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.\\
149 - Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work and see this woman?\\
150 - Forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there's a simple solution.\\
151 - Wake up, wake up, wake up.\\
152 - Bring Penny to meet Mandy.\\
153 - What? Why?\\
154 - Well, right now, Penny's imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears.\\
155 - Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.\\
156 - Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.\\
157 - And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that.\\
158 - Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.\\
159 - Really? Why is that?\\
160 - What, you actually want to meet her?\\
161 - No, but now that you're being weird about it, maybe I should.\\
162 - I'm not being weird.\\
163 - Am I being weird?\\
164 - Yes.\\
165 - And that's coming from me.\\
166 - Fine, you want to meet her?\\
167 - No, I just want to know that when you're at work, there's nothing going on.\\
168 - How many times do I have to tell you?\\
169 - I have no interest in this woman.\\
170 - Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.\\
171 - In Leonard?\\
172 - Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.\\
173 - I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.\\
174 - Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.\\
175 - (sighs) What do you think?\\
176 - Oh, I don't know what to think.\\
177 - But then again, I just found out about it.\\
178 - You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn't anything like the guys I was used to dating.\\
179 - I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating because that's usually how we met.\\
180 - Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.\\
181 - I want to believe you. I really do.\\
182 - Am I being naive?\\
183 - Oh, I don't know.\\
184 - This is all so new to me.\\
185 - I'm still processing.\\
186 - You know, he never would've done this when we first met.\\
187 - He's cockier now.\\
188 - That's because you made him more confident.\\
189 - You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would've grown into the person he is now.\\
190 - I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it's better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn't have any other choice.\\
191 - I never thought about it like that.\\
192 - Oh, me neither, not until just now.\\
193 - Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to "Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags."\\
194 - You may notice that I'm holding a remote control.\\
195 - That's because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me.\\
196 - I'm going to pause here to let that sink in.\\
197 - Okay.\\
198 - If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button.\\
199 - But the show must go on.\\
200 - And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand.\\
201 - Anyway, let's not spend any more time talking about her.\\
202 - We're here to talk about flags.\\
203 - Tonight's theme: flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.\\
204 - You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counselor?\\
205 - $250 an hour. Why?\\
206 - How do you know?\\
207 - Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.\\
208 - And I'm just hearing about this now?\\
209 - Dude, just because we're best friends doesn't mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.\\
210 - You don't have to, you should want to.\\
211 - Oh, great, there's Mandy.\\
212 - Why are marine biologists always so cute?\\
213 - I don't know, but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.\\
214 - That's not helpful.\\
215 - Then I won't say I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.\\
216 - Are we done?\\
217 - Not yet, this is fun.\\
218 - Ooh, I know.\\
219 - I'd let her free my willy.\\
220 - Where you going?\\
221 - I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.\\
222 - Leonard, wait.\\
223 - What?\\
224 - I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.\\
225 - Now we are done. (chuckles)\\
226 - Hey.\\
227 - Oh, hi, Leonard. What's up?\\
228 - Uh, do you mind if I sit?\\
229 - Sure.\\
230 - So, um, I've been thinking a lot about you and me and... the boat.\\
231 - What about it?\\
232 - You know... what we did, when we were drunk.\\
233 - Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?\\
234 - No, we just made out.\\
235 - Oh. Well, good for me.\\
236 - So what can I do for you?\\
237 - Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.\\
238 - Oh, congratulations!\\
239 - To Sheldon?\\
240 - (chuckles)\\
241 - Never gets old.\\
242 - No, no, to a girl.\\
243 - Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work.\\
244 - It was just a kiss.\\
245 - Why would you even tell her?\\
246 - Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us.\\
247 - Is that really the reason?\\
248 - What else would it be?\\
249 - I don't know.\\
250 - Sounds like you're trying to sabotage the relationship.\\
251 - No, I don't think so.\\
252 - Although, Penny did say exactly that.\\
253 - Okay, well, that's something to think about.\\
254 - You know, on some level, I've always believed that I don't deserve a woman like her.\\
255 - Oh, you're gonna think about that right here?\\
256 - I mean, she's really beautiful.\\
257 - She could have any guy she wants.\\
258 - Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.\\
259 - Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.\\
260 - Too expensive.\\
261 - You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love.\\
262 - I mean, my mother did.\\
263 - I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn't have any interest in me.\\
264 - Imagine that.\\
265 - I wonder if that's why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon.\\
266 - I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon's head on it.\\
267 - And your wife is worried about me?\\
268 - Koothrappali: Hey, Leonard!\\
269 - When you're done, we came up with a bunch more.\\
270 - Then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, "I don't think you understand how being broken up works!"\\
271 - Can you believe that?\\
272 - You'd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it's not as young as it used to be.\\
273 - And I don't see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.\\
274 - I'm gonna kill him.\\
275 - But enough about the Czech Republic.\\
276 - Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn't.\\
277 - And yet Romania gets dumped.\\
278 - I'll pause here while you mull that one over.\\
279 - I know, right?\\
280 - So, you said you had something to tell me.\\
281 - Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?\\
282 - Uh-huh.\\
283 - I've been thinking about it, and you might be right.\\
284 - But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why.\\
285 - I'm listening.\\
286 - Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.\\
287 - Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could've possibly come up with.\\
288 - But I get it.\\
289 - You do?\\
290 - Yeah.\\
291 - Sometimes I worry you're gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.\\
292 - I don't even understand why you're with someone like me.\\
293 - Why would I want to be with someone like me?\\
294 - You know what I mean.\\
295 - And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.\\
296 - (sighs) Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?\\
297 - That sounds nice.\\
298 - Good.\\
299 - (both chuckle)\\
300 - Because...\\
301 - I've loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.\\
302 - Oh.\\
303 - Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.\\
304 - Yeah?\\
305 - That's because you're beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.\\
306 - It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.\\
307 - Huh?\\
308 - If you think that's cheesy, buckle up.\\
309 - Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?\\
310 - Oh, damn it, you topped it.\\
311 - Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?\\
312 - Yes, please!\\
313 - Okay!\\
314 - Sheldon, I can't believe you got us a wedding gift.\\
315 - I don't know why you're so surprised.\\
316 - I watch movies; I see what people do.\\
317 - What is this?\\
318 - Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.\\
319 - Oh!\\
320 - Wow!\\
321 - That's so great!\\
322 - Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars.\\
323 - We're gonna have so much fun.\\
324 - (knocking on door)\\
325 - We?\\
326 - Is there a problem?\\
327 - Oh, no, no!\\
328 - I just, I said, "Whee!"\\
329 - How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?!\\
330 - You saw through that one, did you?\\
331 - I don't know what you were thinking, but take the video down now!\\
332 - She watched it.\\
333 - I'm gonna get that girl back.\\
334 - Amy: I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line: "This is gonna make you mad"!\\
335 - She was listening through the door. She wants me.

1 - Would you pass the mustard?\\
2 - Sure.\\
3 - Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?\\
4 - Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavor were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defense against caterpillars?\\
5 - Yeah.\\
6 - Well, that was fun.\\
7 - Good for you, Leonard.\\
8 - Hey, there.\\
9 - Hey, you're early.\\
10 - The movie doesn't start for an hour.\\
11 - Actually, we're not going to the movies.\\
12 - We are here to kidnap you.\\
13 - What are you talking about?\\
14 - Well, you eloped and we didn't get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there's a van downstairs and we're here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.\\
15 - Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.\\
16 - Where's the blindfold?\\
17 - Where's the duct tape?\\
18 - Where's the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say, "I'm getting too old for this crud"?\\
19 - When do we leave?\\
20 - Right now.\\
21 - Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.\\
22 - Wow, okay.\\
23 - You're seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?\\
24 - Oh, not just him; you're coming, too.\\
25 - Oh, and how do you think you're going to get me to do that?\\
26 - Unhand me!\\
27 - This is ridiculous!\\
28 - I told you to put tape on his mouth!\\
29 - And I told you he bit me!\\

43 - Well, Sheldon, there's something about this van that you're going to find very interesting.\\
44 - It runs on syphilis?\\
45 - This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero...\\
46 - Richard Feynman.\\
47 - No.\\
48 - Yeah!\\
49 - A buddy of mine let me borrow it.\\
50 - This was Feynman's van?\\
51 - That's so cool.\\
52 - Yeah, nothing's been changed since he drove it.\\
53 - I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.\\
54 - Yeah, and talked about physics with them!\\
55 - (gasps)\\
56 - So, are you gonna give us a clue where we're headed?\\
57 - Uh, okay, let's see...\\

65 - I'm from Texas--\\

2 - Oh, we're glad you had fun.\\
3 - Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store?\\
4 - It's like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.\\
5 - I still don't understand why you bought that pill caddie.\\

7 - Age is a state of mind, Leonard.\\

9 - Why are you taking your bins over there?\\
10 - That's just where I need them.\\
11 - You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space.\\
12 - What's wrong with your closet?\\
13 - Uh...\\
14 - Well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.\\
15 - So that's all this day was?\\
16 - A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?\\
17 - Come on, buddy.\\
18 - No, I thought we were friends.\\
19 - You asked for a sip of my Icee.\\
20 - If you had your own straw, I might've said yes.\\
21 - Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.\\

37 - Thank you for letting me come speak with you.\\
38 - Of course.\\
39 - As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I'm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.\\
40 - Aww.\\
41 - I'm honored.\\
42 - I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study.\\
43 - Leonard's mother is on a book tour.\\
44 - My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.\\
45 - So, I'm your seventh choice.\\
46 - Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.\\
47 - How can I help you?\\
48 - Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard's moving in with Penny.\\
49 - It's difficult not to feel abandoned.\\
50 - Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity?\\
51 - You had other roommates before Leonard.\\
52 - Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.\\
53 - Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard.\\
54 - Someone I can rub in his face.\\
55 - Chris Pratt's all the rage right now.\\
56 - I wonder how he'd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.\\
57 - Hey.\\
58 - Hey.\\
59 - You know who would be the perfect roommate?\\
60 - Gandalf, but he's a smoker.\\
61 - Stuart.\\
62 - He's been living with us for a while now.\\
63 - I'm sure he'd love to get us out of his hair.\\
64 - Nope, couldn't be happier.\\

74 - Hey.\\
75 - Hey, Stuart.\\
76 - Do you guys know any musicians?\\
77 - Why?\\
78 - I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week.\\
79 - You know, give this place more of a "staying in business" vibe.\\
80 - What kind of music are you thinking of?\\
81 - I like all kinds of music, but my favorite genre is free.\\
82 - Hey, we've always talked about playing together.\\
83 - Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.\\
84 - Oh, we could play "filk" music.\\
85 - What's that?\\
86 - It's been around for years.\\
87 - It's like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.\\
88 - I like it.\\
89 - It sounds exactly like something I shouldn't be expected to pay for.\\
90 - Dude, if we do this, we're gonna need a cool band name.\\
91 - You know, I've actually (chuckles) had one I've been sitting on for years.\\
92 - Really?\\
93 - It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.\\
94 - What is it?\\
95 - Footprints on the Moon.\\
96 - I just got chills.\\
97 - So did I.\\
98 - Me, too.\\
99 - But I-I might have Lyme Disease.\\
100 - Just a few more signatures, and we'll be finished.\\
101 - Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key.\\
102 - Okay.\\
103 - As my future neighbor, I'd like you to have a key.\\
104 - Initial here to acknowledge you received it.\\
105 - I'm proud of you. You're taking this really well.\\
106 - Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again.\\
107 - Which brings us to article 23 subsection C-- please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.\\
108 - Do I really have to do that now?\\
109 - No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish,year that's on you.\\
110 - All right.\\
111 - Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen.\\
112 - In which case, all glory to the hive queen.\\
113 - All right, now all that's left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.\\
114 - What's the matter?\\
115 - It's harder than I thought.\\
116 - Let me help you.\\
117 - L-E-O-N...\\
118 - That helped.\\
119 - So I have an idea for a filk song.\\
120 - Kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.\\
121 - Is it cold in here, 'cause, oh, my.\\
122 - Okay, so it's a, it's a David and Goliath story.\\
123 - It's about man against God.\\
124 - It's called "Hammer and Whip: "The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones."\\
125 - Thor versus Indiana Jones?\\
126 - You just blew my filking mind.\\
127 - Okay, I don't have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um...\\
128 -  Oh, Indy \\
129 -  Oh, Indy \\
130 -  The skies are so windy \\
131 -  Is that a flying man with a killer bod? \\
132 -  Wait \\
133 -  That's no man \\
134 -  It's a Norse god. \\
135 - Oh yes, definitely.\\
136 - Hang on.\\
137 -  Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer \\
138 -  Indy rapped, "That's one bad mamma-jamma." \\
139 - That-that is so good!\\
140 - Right?\\
141 - Mamma-jamma just came to me.\\
142 - Okay, and here's the hook.\\
143 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
144 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
145 -  One plays with lightning \\
146 -  The other plays with bones \\
147 - Both:  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
148 - (harmonizing):  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
149 -  One plays with lightning \\
150 -  The other plays with bones. \\
151 - Oh, man, that rocks.\\
152 - Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?\\
153 - Yeah?\\
154 - That's how much we're gonna melt people's faces off.\\
155 - I appreciate your interest in the apartment.\\
156 - I just need to ask you a few standard questions.\\
157 - Sure.\\
158 - It says here you're a chemist.\\
159 - Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?\\
160 - Is that supposed to be a joke?\\
161 - Looks like argon's not the only one with an attitude problem.\\
162 - In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?\\
163 - I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?\\
164 - You're healthy.\\
165 - You have a job in the sciences.\\
166 - I've got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you're the frontrunner.\\
167 - I'm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.\\
168 - But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out.\\
169 - And that Hollywood phony Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.\\
170 - I'm sure you'll find somebody else.\\
171 - I suppose.\\
172 - What happened to me, Amy?\\
173 - Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings.\\
174 - I'd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?\\
175 - I don't know how to help you.\\
176 - You know, feelings are a part of life.\\
177 - They didn't used to be.\\
178 - You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions.\\
179 - I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil Wizard gave him a heart.\\
180 - I don't think that was the point of the movie.\\
181 - Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.\\
182 - There you go.\\
183 - So, what are you thinking for dinner?\\
184 - Well, it's Thai food night.\\
185 - Well, honey, you don't live with Sheldon anymore.\\
186 - You can have anything you want.\\
187 - You're right.\\
188 - But what?\\
189 - Mexican?\\
190 - Italian? German?\\
191 - Indian? Greek?\\
192 - Cuban? Chinese?\\
193 - Pizza? Barbecue?\\
194 - Korean? Korean barbecue?\\
195 - How about Thai food?\\
196 - Oh, thank God. Hey, we're going to dinner. You want to come?\\
197 - Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I've become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I'm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.\\
198 - You heard him, no.\\
199 - Hang on.\\
200 - Wait, you actually think it's 2003?\\
201 - No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn't mean I'm delusional.\\
202 - And since it is 2003, I don't know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.\\
203 - Are you doing okay?\\
204 - I guess.\\
205 - I'm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.\\
206 - Well, come on, he's a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s.\\
207 - He's fine.\\
208 - I hope so.\\
209 - What else can you do? Move back in with him?\\
210 - No, of course not. I-I just feel bad.\\
211 - Well, so do I, but don't you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it's time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?\\
212 - I did like that he had the weather on it.\\
213 - Trust me, this is the right thing.\\
214 - I know.\\
215 - And it's not like we're abandoning him.\\
216 - Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.\\
217 - I can't believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.\\
218 - I can't believe he ran my credit.\\
219 - Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.\\
220 - You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.\\
221 - I'm sorry.\\
222 - I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.\\
223 - Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky, but he's also brilliant and insightful.\\
224 - I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.\\
225 - Hello, 2003!\\
226 - Hey, we brought you Thai.\\
227 - Where is everything?\\
228 - In my present, it's in the future.\\
229 - In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.\\
230 - I know what you're doing.\\
231 - You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you, but it's not happening.\\
232 - No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.\\
233 - Will you knock it off?\\
234 - We're across the hall.\\
235 - As the kids are saying today, "talk to the hand."\\
236 - They're not saying that.\\
237 - They are in 2003.\\
238 - No, they're really not.\\
239 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
240 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
241 -  One runs from Loki \\
242 -  The other runs from stones. \\
243 - So, what do you think?\\
244 - Wow.\\
245 - Runs from stones means that-that big boulder, but I couldn't rhyme anything with boulder.\\
246 - Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder...\\
247 - Right, yeah, right.\\
248 - But... what do you think?\\
249 - I think it's very cute.\\
250 - Cute? It's not cute.\\
251 - Cute is children dressed as vegetables.\\
252 - Okay, fine, it's not cute.\\
253 - Just be honest. You don't like it.\\
254 - I didn't say that.\\
255 - I-I just like music you can dance to.\\
256 - You can dance to this!\\
257 - Um, uh, uh...\\
258 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
259 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
260 -  One plays with lightning \\
261 -  The other plays with bones. \\
262 - I'm telling you, dude, the song has no groove.\\
263 - You can't dance to it.\\
264 - Who cares?\\
265 - I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.\\
266 - You can do both, like Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean."\\
267 - While you're dancing you're thinking, like, "Darn it, whose baby is it?"\\
268 - Where's this coming from?\\
269 - A few hours ago, we both loved this song.\\
270 - I still love it.\\
271 - I just think there's room for improvement.\\
272 - You played it for Emily, didn't you?\\
273 - Yeah, so what? You are such a wimp.\\
274 - She didn't like it, now you don't like it.\\
275 - No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician.\\
276 - You're the one who's stuck in the past.\\
277 - The past was lunch!\\
278 - You know what's really happening here?\\
279 - Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.\\
280 - She has nothing to do with this.\\
281 - I am my own man.\\
282 - Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever's willing to sleep with you.\\
283 - That is so not true.\\
284 - Really?\\
285 - Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?\\
286 - That had nothing to do with Rachel.\\
287 - It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.\\
288 - I don't need this.\\
289 - I'm quitting the band!\\
290 - Fine, I quit, too!\\
291 - Then get out of my house!\\
292 - With pleasure!\\
293 - (door slams)\\
294 - (sighs)\\
295 - Raj, wait.\\
296 - What took you so long?\\
297 - Leonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.\\
298 - How can you say that?\\
299 - Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.\\
300 - Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.\\
301 - No, I do.\\
302 - Eventually you'll want more space, and you'll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it'll only be a couple of times a month, and then it'll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz.\\
303 - Or-or-or like when Koothrappali's weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body.\\
304 - Or Amy's wedding, where she's marrying someone better than me.\\
305 - Okay, look, we don't need to rush into anything.\\
306 - All right?\\
307 - Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and... sometimes we'll sleep over there, and sometimes we'll sleep over here.\\
308 - But mostly here.\\
309 - Sure.\\
310 - W-W-What about what you said in the restaurant?\\
311 - Well, it's not forever.\\
312 - It's just for a while.\\
313 - If you want, we can think of him like he's our dog.\\
314 - You can.\\
315 - I'm happy when you come home.\\
316 - And I'm scared of fireworks.\\
317 - And by the way, on July Fourth, we're all sleeping here.\\
318 - Fine.\\
319 - All right, great!\\
320 - Just give me one minute, and I'll get started on a new Roommate Agreement.\\
321 - Yeah.\\
322 - Nothing from Pratt. We're good.\\
323 -  Indy' whip snapped \\
324 -  Thor's hammer missed \\
325 -  It was Avenger \\
326 -  Versus archeologist \\
327 -  Indy held his ground \\
328 -  And straightened his fedora \\
329 -  Thor said, "That's a nice look \\
330 -  In 1944-a" \\
331 - Both:  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
332 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
333 -  One plays with lightning \\
334 -  The other plays bones \\
335 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
336 - (high-pitched):  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
337 -  Thor and Dr. Jones \\
338 -  One plays with lightning \\
339 -  The other plays bones. \\
340 - (song ends)\\
341 - Play something we can dance to.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Perspiration Implementation}
1 - Hey, ready for lunch?\\
2 - Oh, one sec.\\
3 - Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?\\
4 - No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I'm exercising.\\
5 - That'll teach her to care about your health.\\
6 - I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.\\
7 - When was the last actual exercise you got?\\
8 - The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.\\
9 - According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits.\\
10 - For all you know, I could be exercising right now.\\
11 - Are you?\\
12 - Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.\\
13 - It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active.\\
14 - Oh. You make an excellent point.\\
15 - Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high!\\
16 -  Our whole universe was in hot, dense state \\
17 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
18 -  The Earth began to cool \\
19 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
20 -  We built the Wall \\
21 -  We built the pyramids \\
22 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
23 -  That all started with a big bang \\
24 -  Bang! \\
25 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x05 \\
26 - The Perspiration Implementation\\
27 - Look at all these activities the university has.\\
28 - Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.\\
29 - Had me at flag, lost me at football.\\
30 - Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?\\
31 - What are you saying? We're not coordinated enough to play sports?\\
32 - Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.\\
33 - I got a triple-word score with a double letter "Q." If that's not a time to bust out the Scrabble dance, what's the point of having one?\\
34 - Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.\\
35 - Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal.\\
36 - And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.\\
37 - It's indoors, so no sunscreen.\\
38 - No throwing, no catching, no running.\\
39 - No gym shorts that can be yanked down.\\
40 - Or worse, up.\\
41 - Preach.\\
42 - And as an added bonus, the word "touché" comes from fencing.\\
43 - It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.\\
44 - What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?\\
45 - Ah, touché.\\
46 - Thanks for coming by.\\
47 - Sure. So how can we help?\\
48 - Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I-I can't get 'em in here.\\
49 - All right, well, what have you tried so far?\\
50 - Uh, I've-I've been stocking more female-oriented titles.\\
51 - Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle.\\
52 - And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.\\
53 - Really? In a comic book store?\\
54 - Oh, don't worry. I-I've got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren't being pervs.\\
55 - Anyway, so what do I got to do to-to get you in the door?\\
56 - Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork.\\
57 - I mean, this woman's actually on a leash like a dog.\\
58 - Well, you don't know the backstory.\\
59 - Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.\\
60 - I feel cool.\\
61 - Like Puss in Boots.\\
62 - I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.\\
63 - Technically, "swashbuckler" is a combination of two terms. "Swash" referring to the sound of the sword.\\
64 - Swash.\\
65 - And then "buckler" meaning a small shield, which you don't have.\\
66 - We can still be swashers.\\
67 - Hmm.\\
68 - Well said, Puss.\\
69 - Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club.\\
70 - Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke.\\
71 - I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be like Star Wars.\\
72 - That's not why we're here.\\
73 - Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.\\
74 - And maybe a little Princess Bride.\\
75 - Ooh, ooh! I forgot about Princess Bride!\\
76 - That's my answer!\\
77 - Well, sorry to disappoint you, but fencing is a serious sport.\\
78 - If you're not willing to put in the effort, you might as well just leave now.\\
79 - We're not afraid of physical activity.\\
80 - Yeah.\\
81 - I already ran 18 miles today.\\
82 - All right. Let's begin with some fundamentals.\\
83 - This is the en garde position.\\
84 - Feet are in an "L." Heels in a straight line.\\
85 - Elbow is about a fist from the rib cage.\\
86 - Notice my dominant leg faces forward.\\
87 - Oh, dear.\\
88 - What's wrong, Cooper?\\
89 - Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg.\\
90 - They're both pretty submissive.\\
91 - When you're in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?\\
92 - Right. Always right.\\
93 - He's a righty.\\
94 - Okay, show me en garde.\\
95 - Good. Knees bent, slightly over the toe.\\
96 - Non-sword hand up for balance.\\
97 - (groans) I am going to feel this tomorrow.\\
98 - The first move is called an advance.\\
99 - You move your front foot forward, heel to toe.\\
100 - Back foot follows.\\
101 - So front foot forward, heel to toe.\\
102 - Back foot follows.\\
103 - Now you try. Advance.\\
104 - And advance. And advance.\\
105 - This is easy. I didn't need to wear a cup.\\
106 - Kripke: Good.\\
107 - The next move is called a retreat.\\
108 - Step back.\\
109 - Back foot first, toe to heel.\\
110 - Front foot follows.\\
111 - On three.\\
112 - Excuse me, Barry?\\
113 - Yes.\\
114 - When can I stab one of my friends?\\
115 - In fencing, we don't call it a stab.\\
116 - We call it a touch.\\
117 - Uh, yes, I'm aware.\\
118 - But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I'll get called into Human Resources.\\
119 - Okay, on three, Cooper and Koothrappali advance, the other two retreat.\\
120 - One, two, three.\\
121 - Very good. Switch it up.\\
122 - One, two, three.\\
123 - Switch again. One, two, three.\\
124 - (phone rings)\\
125 - (groans)\\
126 - Excuse me.\\
127 - Can I call you back?\\
128 - No, I'm teaching a class.\\
129 - Sure. Sure.\\
130 - An hour, tops.\\
131 - Yeah. Okay.\\
132 - Okay. Yeah.\\
133 - Okay. Thanks.\\
134 - And one, two, three.\\
135 - Have you thought about advertising directly to females?\\
136 - Hmm, okay.\\
137 - Well... All right.\\
138 - What if I put up a sign in the window that said, "Women, come in. Don't be afraid."\\
139 - Penny: Hey.\\
140 - Uh, have you read the online reviews for this place?\\
141 - Eh, the Internet's so negative.\\
142 - I try to avoid it.\\
143 - All right, well, Heather H. says, "The owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once."\\
144 - Kelly M. says, "The creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no."\\
145 - Jessica K. says, "I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me."\\
146 - See? Negative.\\
147 - With your foil extended, kick your front leg up and push off with your back leg.\\
148 - Now you try.\\
149 - And again.\\
150 - And again.\\
151 - Look at us! We're like the Rockettes!\\
152 - En garde, Leonard.\\
153 - Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.\\
154 - (Spanish accent): My name is Inigo Montoya.\\
155 - You killed my father.\\
156 - Prepare to die.\\
157 - (Spanish accent): My name is Inigo Montoya.\\
158 - You killed my father. Prepare to die.\\
159 - I thought you were Puss in Boots.\\
160 - Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.\\
161 - (Spanish accent): My name is Puss in Boots.\\
162 - You killed my father.\\
163 - Prepare to die.\\
164 - I'm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.\\
165 - What?\\
166 - You know, when my honor is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.\\
167 - When was your honor insulted?\\
168 - My last physical.\\
169 - Again, that doctor didn't insult your honor.\\
170 - Just checked your prostate.\\
171 - My name is Little Orphan Annie.\\
172 - You killed my father.\\
173 - Prepare to die.\\
174 - (with accent): My name is Darth Vader.\\
175 - I am your father. Ah!\\
176 - This is fun.\\
177 - Good.\\
178 - It's nice to see your mind off Amy.\\
179 - What's going on with Amy?\\
180 - Not that it's any of your business, but she broke up with me.\\
181 - Really?\\
182 - Good to know.\\
183 - "Good to know"? What's that supposed to mean?\\
184 - Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.\\
185 - Well, that's unacceptable.\\
186 - Oh, buddy, I get that you don't like it, but it's not really up to you.\\
187 - Yeah, but he's dumb, and his face is dumb.\\
188 - Look, even if it's not him, Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.\\
189 - You really think so?\\
190 - Of course. She deserves to be happy.\\
191 - How dare you!\\
192 - Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.\\
193 - Barry, a word?\\
194 - And now the crazy version of what I just said.\\
195 - If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.\\
196 - And how are you gonna do that?\\
197 - By challenging you to a duel.\\
198 - You've had one lesson.\\
199 - I'll destroy you.\\
200 - That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today.\\
201 - If you're worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then.\\
202 - Yeah, and be warned.\\
203 - I'm going to touch you all over.\\
204 - Wow. That-that was crazier than I thought.\\
205 - All right, I'm not saying it's true, but let's-let's consider for a moment that possibly I'm the problem.\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - You are.\\
208 - You can say it.\\
209 - Okay, fine. What...?\\
210 - I mean, what can I do?\\
211 - I get so nervous around women.\\
212 - Well, you're talking to us now.\\
213 - I mean, you don't seem nervous.\\
214 - Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked.\\
215 - By the way, thumbs up, ladies.\\
216 - Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?\\
217 - (laughing): It was a joke.\\
218 - Was it?\\
219 - No, I'm still doing it.\\
220 - Okay.\\
221 - Don't be offended, but... what went wrong with you?\\
222 - I-I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn't run away or kill itself.\\
223 - That really happened?\\
224 - I mean, I can't say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car.\\
225 - Anyway, the longer I'm alone, the more desperate I get.\\
226 - Stuart, believe it or not, I understand.\\
227 - You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time.\\
228 - I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.\\
229 - (laughing): Okay, we're all feeling it.\\
230 - Yes, I'll go out with you.\\
231 - Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.\\
232 - I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.\\
233 - Look at this blister.\\
234 - Like it or not, we're athletes now.\\
235 - Besides, a bar is where I belong.\\
236 - I'm having female problems.\\
237 - If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.\\
238 - Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.\\
239 - That's ridiculous.\\
240 - Koothrappali: Why? You never thought you'd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy.\\
241 - Maybe there's someone else out there for you.\\
242 - True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette.\\
243 - And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.\\
244 - Maybe you should consider women who aren't in serious relationships with your closest friends?\\
245 - There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her.\\
246 - Oh, there's a woman.\\
247 - Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.\\
248 - Whoa, whoa.\\
249 - Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.\\
250 - You're forgetting something.\\
251 - Ladies love jocks.\\
252 - How many sips of that beer did he have?\\
253 - Three.\\
254 - Oh, boy.\\
255 - Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup, and I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better.\\
256 - And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, "I choose you."\\
257 - What?\\
258 - It's a Pokémon reference.\\
259 - I don't know what that means.\\
260 - Well, we gave it a shot.\\
261 - How about you?\\
262 - I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.\\
263 - Ah, what might have been.\\
264 - And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.\\
265 - Stuart took that rejection like a pro.\\
266 - Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.\\
267 - I don't have much practice turning men down.\\
268 - It wasn't so much fun.\\
269 - Oh, you get used to it.\\
270 - Some guys you have to turn down over and over.\\
271 - And sometimes we marry them anyway.\\
272 - (phone chimes)\\
273 - Huh.\\
274 - Well, this is weird.\\
275 - What?\\
276 - Barry Kripke just asked me out.\\
277 - (gasps)\\
278 - Bernadette: Oh.\\
279 - Look at you-- two guys in one day!\\
280 - I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows!\\
281 - What did he say?\\
282 - "Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime."\\
283 - Well, what are you gonna do?\\
284 - I don't know.\\
285 - I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.\\
286 - What can it hurt?\\
287 - Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.\\
288 - You mean, not a scientist?\\
289 - I think she means not a weirdo.\\
290 - Are you attracted to him?\\
291 - I don't know.\\
292 - All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?\\
293 - Oh, I don't have to imagine it.\\
294 - (gasps)\\
295 - I smell funny.\\
296 - I taste salty.\\
297 - You're just sweaty from exercise.\\
298 - And kind of delicious.\\
299 - I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the center of me.\\
300 - I know it only takes one doctor's finger.\\
301 - Hello.\\
302 - Hello.\\
303 - We should let you guys talk.\\
304 - Yeah.\\
305 - You don't have to leave.\\
306 - Look at me go!\\
307 - Uh, Bernadette, you're my ride.\\
308 - Bernadette: Walk!\\
309 - How have you been?\\
310 - I'm doing all right.\\
311 - I tried fencing today.\\
312 - How'd that go?\\
313 - It was pretty easy.\\
314 - And I think my background in "mathletics" helped.\\
315 - Barry Kripke was there.\\
316 - I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.\\
317 - Well, actually, he-he already did.\\
318 - Okay.\\
319 - But don't get too attached to him.\\
320 - In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.\\
321 - I said no.\\
322 - Interesting.\\
323 - I asked two women out today, and they both said no.\\
324 - I didn't know you were interested in dating.\\
325 - I've been told it's a good way to move on.\\
326 - Oh.\\
327 - Okay.\\
328 - Anyway, um, it's nice to see you.\\
329 - You look good.\\
330 - Mmm, thanks.\\
331 - And I taste good too.\\
332 - Howie?\\
333 - What's up?\\
334 - Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
\subsection {Episode 06: The Helium Insufficiency}
1 - Sheldon: Leonard...\\
2 - I've got terrible news.\\
3 - What's going on?\\
4 - Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow.\\
5 - You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.\\
6 - Just tell me.\\
7 - A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super- fluid vortex experiment.\\
8 - Oh, well, that kind of stinks.\\
9 - “That kind of stinks”?\\
10 - Why aren't you more upset?\\
11 - Did I soften the blow too much?\\
12 - Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.\\
13 - What are we going to do?\\
14 - Perform the experiment immediately.\\
15 - I'd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment's on back order for a month.\\
16 - A month? What? Are you kidding me?\\
17 - That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.\\
18 - That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.\\
19 - Thank you. Aren't you sweet.\\
20 - Let's go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.\\
21 - Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?\\
22 - Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.\\
23 - We need liquid helium-- does the department have any we can use?\\
24 - Sorry, there's a shortage.\\
25 - And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.\\
26 - But you won't need much for that.\\
27 - True, but if it's successful, I'm having a party with balloons.\\
28 - Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us.\\
29 - Can't you spare any?\\
30 - Be honest-- if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?\\
31 - Yes.\\
32 - No chance.\\
33 - What are you doing?\\
34 - He said be honest, so I was honest.\\
35 - Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy.\\
36 - So, what do you say?\\
37 - Hell no.\\
38 - He could've softened the blow.\\
39 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
40 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
41 -  The Earth began to cool \\
42 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
43 -  We built the Wall \\
44 -  We built the pyramids \\
45 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
46 -  That all started with a big bang \\
47 -  Bang! \\
48 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x06 \\
49 - The Helium Insufficiency\\
50 - Original Air Date on October 26, 2015\\
51 - Why do you need Kripke?\\
52 - Why don't you just go to Party City for helium?\\
53 - We'd have to go to every Party City in California.\\
54 - Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.\\
55 - Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.\\
56 - Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again.\\
57 - Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.\\
58 - If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.\\
59 - Who is he? Where does he work?\\
60 - How does he get the helium?\\
61 - How many questions are too many questions?\\
62 - Maybe he's not for you.\\
63 - Four questions. There answer's four.\\
64 - Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.\\
65 - Oh, good for him.\\
66 - I thought so, too.\\
67 - So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?\\
68 - He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.\\
69 - Oh, which one?\\
70 - Maybe we can get Amy to try it.\\
71 - I don't know.\\
72 - Stuart, can you come in here?\\
73 - He tried to explain it to me.\\
74 - It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.\\
75 - Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.\\
76 - What's up?\\
77 - Can you show us that dating app?\\
78 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
79 - This thing has changed my life.\\
80 - Wow. So how many girls have you met?\\
81 - Two.\\
82 - I probably don't need to mention there's an entire number between that and zero.\\
83 - Well, so how does it work?\\
84 - Uh, well, it-it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app.\\
85 - If I like the way they look, I hit “thumbs up.”\\
86 - If I don't, “thumbs down.”\\
87 - Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?\\
88 - First time it happens I will let you know.\\
89 - Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.\\
90 - What's he say?\\
91 - He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.\\
92 - Oh, really?\\
93 - You know I don't like buying things at night.\\
94 - January 7, 2009.\\
95 - I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?\\
96 - The man restocking the cereal shelves.\\
97 - That's right. And what did he do?\\
98 - He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.\\
99 - (shudders)\\
100 - It's like it was yesterday.\\
101 - Do you want liquid helium or not?\\
102 - Of course I do.\\
103 - I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.\\
104 - Then I'm going to tell him we're in.\\
105 - Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.\\
106 - We're just bending the rules a little.\\
107 - We have grant money to do the experiment, so we're going to spend it on the helium we need.\\
108 - It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.\\
109 - Was she helping him with his research?\\
110 - Sure.\\
111 - So, are we doing this?\\
112 - Okay, but where does he get the helium?\\
113 - Remember? Don't ask too many questions?\\
114 - Uh, but this is violating university code.\\
115 - A little, but... (stammers) if I may quote Einstein, “The pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man”"\\
116 - Huh.\\
117 - All right, do it.\\
118 - Tell him we're in.\\
119 - (Leonard typing rapidly)\\
120 - Done.\\
121 - I can't find that quote on the Internet.\\
122 - Did you make that up?\\
123 - Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.\\
124 - Aren't you just made of sugar.\\
125 - I'm not sure how I feel about this.\\
126 - Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.\\
127 - Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.\\
128 - One of which would've ended in s*x had she not said no.\\
129 - Okay, all set.\\
130 - Okay, let me see. (clears her throat)\\
131 - Nope, nope, nope...\\
132 - Oh, he's cute!\\
133 - Doesn't a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?\\
134 - And he's sad about it.\\
135 - Hey. Hello.\\
136 - Hey. Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?\\
137 - If you wanted me to stay out later, you should've given me more spending money.\\
138 - What are you guys up to?\\
139 - We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing what's out there.\\
140 - Oh, fun! Let me see.\\
141 - Uh, no... no, uh, definitely not.\\
142 - What was wrong with that guy?\\
143 - Uh, he's Indian.\\
144 - We've already got one of those.\\
145 - Ooh, we should find a nice Latino.\\
146 - It really round us out.\\
147 - Hey, I want to try.\\
148 - Uh, excuse me, c-can I have my phone back?\\
149 - Hang on, I'm trying to find you the next great love of your life.\\
150 - The man who will father your children.\\
151 - Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?\\
152 - (all clamoring)\\
153 - That must be him.\\
154 - Sheldon: Oh, of course.\\
155 - An nondescript, white panel van.\\
156 - You may be familiar with it from the sentence:\\
157 - “Their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van”"\\
158 - (doors close)\\
159 - Hey.\\
160 - What's up?\\
161 - Uh, I'm Leonard.\\
162 - This is my friend-- I'm Skippy.\\
163 - Skippy Cavanaugh.\\
164 - Great.\\
165 - You got the cash?\\
166 - Uh, yeah, uh, right here.\\
167 - Wait, hold on, hold on.\\
168 - How do we know that you're not gonna take the money and drive away?\\
169 - What ya doing, Skippy?\\
170 - Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us.\\
171 - You give us the helium first.\\
172 - Oh, how do I know you're not gonna drive away without paying me?\\
173 - Guess I'm not the only one who watches '70s television crime dramas.\\
174 - Look, you can trust us.\\
175 - We're respected scientists.\\
176 - Well, he is.\\
177 - I'm a wedding planner, who can't find love himself.\\
178 - It's ironic, but the point is we can't trust you.\\
179 - You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.\\
180 - Yeah, well, from my perspective, that's how you two appear to me.\\
181 - Well, I never thought of it like that.\\
182 - Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?\\
183 - My friend does make a decent point about the money.\\
184 - I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.\\
185 - Ah-ah-ah, no money, no helium.\\
186 - Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.\\
187 - Not technically.\\
188 - In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves.\\
189 - Uh, you have plenty of moves available.\\
190 - You could beat us up and steal the money.\\
191 - You could kill us, you know.\\
192 - Really, you're only limited by your imagination.\\
193 - Huh. All these years, I've been using “stalemate,” when I really mean “impasse.” I feel foolish.\\
194 - I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?\\
195 - Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be a Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.\\
196 - Not necessarily.\\
197 - Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.\\
198 - Hmm, I don't follow.\\
199 - Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work.\\
200 - Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, “You give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities”\\
201 - Is that a threat?\\
202 - Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.\\
203 - Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I'll report you, then I'll pound your asses into the ground.\\
204 - Perfect! Now we really are in a Mexican standoff.\\
205 - Is this one of those times where I've won the battle but lost the war?\\
206 - Afraid so, Skippy.\\
207 - I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.\\
208 - All right, let's all just calm down.\\
209 - Nobody wants to report anybody.\\
210 - No, I don't like this. I'm out.\\
211 - No, no, no. Wait, don't go.\\
212 - Just let me explain. We're physicists, and we're trying to prove a hypothesis that we've been working on for over a year.\\
213 - Really? What's the hypothesis?\\
214 - Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.\\
215 - Hmm. Could be, could be.\\
216 - Go on.\\
217 - Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery.\\
218 - We really need this helium.\\
219 - And I'm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can't find love.\\
220 - Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.\\
221 - Here's the money. Can we do this?\\
222 - Okay.\\
223 - It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off.\\
224 - I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.\\
225 - It's actually pretty common in our field.\\
226 - Not much you can do about it.\\
227 - Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.\\
228 - Did you hear that, Leonard?\\
229 - There's plenty we could do about it.\\
230 - Do you have a card?\\
231 - Okay, here we go.\\
232 - Now everyone can see.\\
233 - All right. (clears throat)\\
234 - Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?\\
235 - You know he won't be looking at other girls.\\
236 - Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.\\
237 - Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down.\\
238 - Next.\\
239 - Ew, check out his tiny teeth.\\
240 - He looks like a man-dolphin.\\
241 - Wait, if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.\\
242 - (high-pitched): I love you, Amy.\\
243 - (squeaking)\\
244 - Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty. Aren't we being a little mean?\\
245 - That's a fair point.\\
246 - We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.\\
247 - Look, it's Stuart!\\
248 - You may want to leave the room.\\
249 - Sheldon: Right this way, Uncle Harvey.\\
250 - Will you stop with that already?\\
251 - I'm trying not to attract attention.\\
252 - And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?\\
253 - She said, “Buenas noches.” What was he supposed to do?\\
254 - Let's just start the experiment.\\
255 - Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.\\
256 - We're not getting caught.\\
257 - Well, you can't be sure of that.\\
258 - What if the helium dealer rats us out?\\
259 - What if Kripke asks where we got it?\\
260 - What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?\\
261 - The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot.\\
262 - Help me hook this up.\\
263 - Uh-oh. What?\\
264 - Well, did you see this sticker? What is it?\\
265 - It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads:\\
266 - “Property of” and the letter “U.”\\
267 - It's probably USC or UCLA.\\
268 - Yeah, but what if it's “Property of U.S. Government”?\\
269 - There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas.\\
270 - If this was stolen from there, we're accessories to a federal crime.\\
271 - Let's not jump to conclusions.\\
272 - A lot of things start with “U.”\\
273 - That's true.\\
274 - There's the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Navy, “you” and I are going to jail.\\
275 - Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.\\
276 - Ma'am.\\
277 - Okay, does everyone remember the rules?\\
278 - If he's shirtless, one sip.\\
279 - Posing with a pet, two sips.\\
280 - Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job.\\
281 - And pull!\\
282 - I have that same underwear!\\
283 - Chug!\\
284 - (phone chimes)\\
285 - Mm, Amy, you're getting a text.\\
286 - Oh, um, give me that.\\
287 - Koothrappali: “I had a great time last night”"\\
288 - No, no, st-stop reading that.\\
289 - Who's Dave?\\
290 - I...\\
291 - You went on a date last night?\\
292 - Are you seeing someone?\\
293 - No, it-it's not like that.\\
294 - (phone chimes)\\
295 - “And I'd love to take you out again”?\\
296 - Amy!\\
297 - What?\\
298 - Can't believe it. Oh, my God.\\
299 - Okay, it's like that.\\
300 - Thank you for coming back.\\
301 - Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't, but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.\\
302 - Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.\\
303 - Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?\\
304 - No, nothing. We just changed our mind.\\
305 - He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all; we are not built for prison.\\
306 - Yeah, I hear you.\\
307 - Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh...\\
308 - I'll take the helium off your hands.\\
309 - Thank you.\\
310 - But you ain't getting your money back.\\
311 - You're taking advantage of us?\\
312 - We clarified nomenclature together.\\
313 - Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.\\
314 - You know what? It's fine. Keep the money.\\
315 - We just want to be done with this.\\
316 - No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.\\
317 - I don't understand.\\
318 - He wants more money.\\
319 - Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars; that's all I've got on me.\\
320 - That's exactly how much it is.\\
321 - Finally, something breaks our way.\\
322 - I can't believe you're seeing someone and we don't even know about it.\\
323 - Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?\\
324 - Because it's new and weird and I'm just trying to figure it all out.\\
325 - And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you'd get way too excited about it.\\
326 - A few people?\\
327 - What?! Amy!\\
328 - Amy!\\
329 - So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?\\
330 - It's going fine.\\
331 - It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.\\
332 - Wha...?!\\
333 - I thought we were all...\\
334 - Never mind.\\
335 - I-I thought you weren't ready to start seeing people.\\
336 - Well, I don't have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.\\
337 - Well, good for you.\\
338 - Thank you.\\
339 - And how many guys have you gone out with?\\
340 - Please be less than two.\\
341 - Three.\\
342 - Damn it.\\
343 - Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.\\
344 - Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?\\
345 - It scared me straight, Leonard.\\
346 - (knock on door)\\
347 - Hey, I've been thinking.\\
348 - I was being petty.\\
349 - You can have my helium.\\
350 - Thank you, Barry.\\
351 - But you have to add my name to your paper.\\
352 - That's preposterous.\\
353 - I don't know, seems fair.\\
354 - You can't do it without me.\\
355 - Can you give us a minute?\\
356 - Take your time.\\
357 - I'll walk out backwards for dramatic effect.\\
358 - I don't like being extorted like this.\\
359 - Especially by him of all people.\\
360 - Me neither, but what other choice do we have?\\
361 - I promise this is the last time.\\
362 - It says right here on Wikipedia. "A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties."\\
363 - How can you trust Wikipedia if they use "between" to refer to three parties? They should've used "among," right?\\
364 - Or "amongst," if they were feeling whimsically archaic.\\
365 - All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?\\
366 - Absolutely.\\
367 - But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.\\
368 - I am open to change.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Spock Resonance}
1 - Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?\\
2 - Hmm. I'm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.\\
3 - In school?\\
4 - Oh, no. At home.\\
5 - The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes...\\
6 - I wish I knew their names.\\
7 - Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?\\
8 - You tell me-- you woke up in bed with one.\\
9 - Listen to this.\\
10 - I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton.\\
11 - Leonard Nimoy's son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away.\\
12 - It's about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.\\
13 - Hmm.\\
14 - Why is he writing to you?\\
15 - Well, they're looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I'd be good for it.\\
16 - Oh. Hey, high five.\\
17 - Absolutely not.\\
18 - Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?\\
19 - Yes. Don't take your shirt off just because the director said so.\\
20 - This is a documentary about Mr. Spock.\\
21 - I'm sure if there's nudity, it will be tasteful.\\

29 -  That all started with a big bang \\
30 -  Bang! \\
31 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x07 \\
32 - The Spock Resonance\\
33 - Original Air Date on November 5, 2015\\
34 - (sword fight sound effects on video game)\\
35 - Hey. You got a minute?\\
36 - Not really.\\
37 - Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.\\
38 - Pause the game, Howard.\\
39 - “Howard”? Uh-oh.\\
40 - Make room, Visigoths.\\
41 - 'Sup?\\
42 - We need to talk about redecorating this place.\\
43 - Oh, no, not this again.\\
44 - Look, I get that you grew up here and you're attached to things looking a certain way, but... I want this to feel like my house, too.\\
45 - Oh, honey, of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?\\
46 - (chuckles)\\
47 - All right. Let's start over.\\
48 - I'm redecorating.\\
49 - The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.\\
50 - I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it.\\
51 - Try not to be one of those things.\\
52 - May I say something?\\
53 - Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper 'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?\\
54 - Never mind.\\
55 - Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.\\
56 - Yeah, I-I know that we're broken up, but I'm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you'd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock.\\
57 - Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.\\
58 - Yeah, I'm going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you're hearing it for the first time.\\
59 - You know, hysterically, hmm?\\
60 - And with a tinge of sadness that I'm no longer in your life.\\
61 - I'm the one who thought of “Spockumentary”"\\
62 - And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.\\
63 - (knocking on door)\\
64 - Hello.\\
65 - Hey, Sheldon.\\
66 - This is Adam Nimoy.\\
67 - Nice to meet you.\\
68 - Oh, it's nice to meet you.\\
69 - I admire your father's work very much.\\
70 - It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey began in my hero's scrotum.\\
71 - I told you. This guy is gold.\\
72 - Whatcha doing?\\
73 - Oh!\\
74 - Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.\\
75 - Okay, listen, I'm thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.\\
76 - I'm listening.\\
77 - Let's just redo one room and see how it goes.\\
78 - That is reasonable.\\
79 - But what room?\\
80 - How 'bout this one?\\
81 - No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.\\
82 - Then how 'bout the bathroom?\\
83 - I want to change my answer.\\
84 - Fine. Then the dining room.\\
85 - I guess we didn't use it very often.\\
86 - Unless we had company.\\
87 - Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom...\\
88 - Great! I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.\\
89 - All right, we're just gonna have a conversation.\\
90 - Pretend the camera's not here.\\
91 - All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.\\
92 - How long have you known Adam?\\
93 - A few years. Mm-hmm.\\
94 - And what are you getting him back for?\\
95 - Let's start with your name and occupation.\\
96 - Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.\\
97 - And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?\\
98 - The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was “The Galileo Seven.”\\
99 - Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II.\\
100 - Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said, “Eat farts.”\\
101 - After that day, I was hooked.\\
102 - On Star Trek, not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.\\
103 - What was it about Spock that appealed to you?\\
104 - I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion.\\
105 - Spock came from a planet governed only by logic.\\
106 - You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, “Why are you hitting yourself?” the answer is, “I'm not.\\
107 - You're moving my arm.”\\
108 - To which he says, “Fascinating.”\\
109 - And then you both watch educational television.\\
110 - (quietly): Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.\\
111 - My brother was mean to me, too.\\
112 - Yeah, you probably had it coming.\\
113 - Do you have any Spock collectibles?\\
114 - I have many.\\
115 - My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny.\\
116 - That's her over there.\\
117 - Hi!\\
118 - Look at that.\\
119 - I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.\\
120 - Can we see the napkin?\\
121 - Of course. Excuse me.\\
122 - This will just take a moment.\\
123 - When did we get a wall safe?\\
124 - When there was no more room in the floor safe.\\
125 - When did we get a floor safe?\\
126 - When we got the security camera.\\
127 - There's a security camera?\\
128 - Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.\\
129 - Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.\\
130 - Yeah. You don't have to tell me.\\
131 - So, your father-in-law is in there right now?\\
132 - Yes. So back me up.\\
133 - The house is good the way it is.\\
134 - Oh, okay. Got it.\\
135 - Hey. What's going on?\\
136 - Hey.\\
137 - Hey, Raj.\\
138 - Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.\\
139 - You sure? It's a... pretty great wall.\\
140 - What's so great about it?\\
141 - I'm sorry. I did what I could.\\
142 - Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?\\
143 - Your dad's on your side.\\
144 - He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.\\
145 - That is so generous of you.\\
146 - I'd like to switch sides.\\
147 - Look, uh...\\
148 - I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.\\
149 - Well, it's easy to find out.\\
150 - Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.\\
151 - When is your visa up?\\
152 - Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth.\\
153 - So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.\\
154 - Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?\\
155 - No offense, but this is pure 100% Nimoy.\\
156 - Because of your mother, you're only 50%.\\
157 - Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.\\
158 - Okay, enough about the napkin.\\
159 - What else you hiding in there?\\
160 - Wouldn't you like to know?\\
161 - I would.\\
162 - All right then.\\
163 - See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will...\\
164 - You have a will?\\
165 - Yeah-- my 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure.\\
166 - I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.\\
167 - Will Wil want it?\\
168 - Wil won't.\\
169 - What's that ring box?\\
170 - Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.\\
171 - What?!\\
172 - You bought her a ring?\\
173 - No, no, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother's finger and stole it.\\
174 - Sheldon, that's awful.\\
175 - No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them, so... it was a happy ending.\\
176 - Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.\\
177 - Okay, back to the ring.\\
178 - Does Amy even know about this?\\
179 - No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.\\
180 - Oh, man, I'm sorry-- that must have been devastating for you.\\
181 - No, not at all.\\
182 - No, I'm fine.\\
183 - You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.\\
184 - Penny: I know. It just...\\
185 - Sheldon: I said I'm fine!\\
186 - We've gotten a little off-topic.\\
187 - Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary.\\
188 - That was Leonard's joke.\\
189 - As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask, “What would Jesus do?”\\
190 - The answer to that was always, “Love thy neighbor.”\\
191 - But my neighbor had a dead tooth, so... that wasn't going to happen.\\
192 - But... that's why I changed it to, “What would Spock do?”\\
193 - Did you find that helpful?\\
194 - Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.\\
195 - I knew I could smell 'em.\\
196 - What about from when you were a kid?\\
197 - Oh, certainly.\\
198 - Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground.\\
199 - I asked myself, “What would Spock do?”\\
200 - Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.\\
201 - Did it work?\\
202 - Oh, no-- he broke my collarbone.\\
203 - I can still hear it click.\\
204 - That must have been very upsetting for you.\\
205 - Oh, not at all.\\
206 - As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I've spent a lifetime mastering.\\
207 - Oh... (sputters)\\
208 - Excuse me?\\
209 - I'm sorry. I'm not here.\\
210 - No. You went (sputters). What does (sputters) mean?\\
211 - Um...\\
212 - You did go (sputters).\\
213 - All right, fine.\\
214 - Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert, but aren't you completely missing the point of Spock?\\
215 - I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.\\
216 - Just like you.\\
217 - I'm just saying, you pretend you don't, but you have feelings just like everybody else.\\
218 - Not true. No, look at me.\\
219 - I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me.\\
220 - And am I emotional about that? No.\\
221 - No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favorite TV character like nothing happened.\\
222 - 'Cause I am just like him: all logical, all the time.\\
223 - Sweetie, you're yelling.\\
224 - Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me!\\
225 - (door slams)\\
226 - This documentary is gonna be awesome.\\
227 - You gonna be okay down here?\\
228 - Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist.\\
229 - Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling.\\
230 - Hey. Look!\\
231 - Found a seashell.\\
232 - Yeah, that's a rat skull.\\
233 - (shrieks)\\
234 - Relax.\\
235 - There's enough droppings down here without you making more.\\
236 - Sorry. Do you have a... sense of where we are?\\
237 - Yeah. I think that's the den.\\
238 - Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.\\
239 - Uh-huh. Yep.\\
240 - You know, I know you don't want to hear this, but it wouldn't take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.\\
241 - Why wouldn't I want to hear it?\\
242 - 'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.\\
243 - That's not true at all.\\
244 - I-I wish she'd get pregnant, believe me.\\
245 - I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get.\\
246 - (sighs)\\
247 - In a... loving and respectful manner.\\
248 - Oh.\\
249 - (clears throat softly)\\
250 - The point is, I really do want kids.\\
251 - Huh.\\
252 - I don't know why she's lying to you.\\
253 - Wolowitz: She's the one who doesn't want kids.\\
254 - In fact, every time I bring up the subject...\\
255 - Earthquake!\\
256 - (Bernadette's feet stomping rapidly)\\
257 - Oh, my God, we're gonna die!\\
258 - Earthquake!\\
259 - Aftershock...!\\
260 - I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.\\
261 - I know.\\
262 - I also can't believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.\\
263 - Yeah.\\
264 - Hello.\\
265 - Hey, buddy. How you doing?\\
266 - Better.\\
267 - Did Wil and Adam leave?\\
268 - Yeah.\\
269 - Do you think they're going to put my outburst in the documentary?\\
270 - Definitely.\\
271 - Oh, yeah.\\
272 - Well, there's no point in dwelling on it.\\
273 - As the Vulcans say, “Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau.”\\
274 - Do you know what that means?\\
275 - No.\\
276 - Are you telling the truth?\\
277 - Nirsh.\\
278 - Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything.\\
279 - If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.\\
280 - What are you gonna do?\\
281 - I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me.\\
282 - And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship.\\
283 - And if she says no... well, then she can just ponfo miran.\\
284 - He didn't meant that.\\
285 - So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.\\
286 - That would be nice.\\
287 - I told my dad that you were the one who didn't want kids because I didn't want to disappoint him.\\
288 - But you were okay throwing me under the bus?\\
289 - Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.\\
290 - Bernie, you don't need to worry about me.\\
291 - But I don't want to see you miss out.\\
292 - Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.\\
293 - Oh, please.\\
294 - Mom did everything.\\
295 - All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer.\\
296 - How is that raising kids?\\
297 - This is really a conversation for husband and wife.\\
298 - (awkward chuckle) I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road.\\
299 - If your mother asks, I was here till 10:00.\\
300 - It's interesting your father didn't help around the house and Howard doesn't help, either, so... in a way, Howard's not only like your father, but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.\\
301 - Why are you still here?\\
302 - Fine, I'll leave.\\
303 - But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.\\
304 - All right... I admit... that I don't help out a lot.\\
305 - (chuckles softly) And I need to work on that.\\
306 - But... (sighs) if we had a kid, it would be different.\\
307 - Why?\\
308 - Because... when my dad left, I promised myself that... if I ever had a chance to be a father...\\
309 - I'd always be there.\\
310 - Okay, I'll think about it.\\
311 - And this an actual “I'll think about it,” not like the “can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I'll think about it”?\\
312 - It's an actual “I'll think about it.”\\
313 - I really believe I'd be a great dad.\\
314 - I know you would.\\
315 - Speaking of... making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?\\
316 - (no voice)\\
317 - Dr. Dana feels he isn't that dangerous.\\
318 - What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?\\
319 - Because she feels. I don't.\\
320 - All I know is logic.\\
321 - (scoffs): Yeah, right.\\
322 - (turns off TV)\\
323 - You can just shut your feelings off.\\
324 - There goes television, lying to us again.\\
325 - We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get.\\
326 - Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?\\
327 - (sighs): Well... now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.\\
328 - Those are very wise words.\\
329 - Thank you.\\
330 - They'd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
\subsection {Episode 08: The Mystery Date Observation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - There's no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, "Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."\\
3 - Do you know what that means?\\
4 - No.\\
5 - Are you telling the truth?\\
6 - Nersh.\\
7 - This is ridiculous-- being upset about Amy all the time isn't accomplishing anything.\\
8 - If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.\\
9 - What are you gonna do?\\
10 - I'm going to find her and ask her to marry me.\\
11 - And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship.\\
12 - And if she says no... well, then she can just ponfo miran.\\
13 - He didn't mean that.\\
14 - I think it's so adorable you're making Sheldon breakfast.\\
15 - Well, he's having a rough time.\\
16 - Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who... that crow followed him home.\\
17 - Aren't you worried you're making French toast on oatmeal day?\\
18 - Ah, well, what's this?\\
19 - A pot of oatmeal?\\
20 - Or, thanks to you, what I will now call "gloatmeal."\\
21 - Oh, I don't want credit for that.\\
22 - Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.\\
23 - You're in a good mood.\\
24 - Yeah, I am indeed.\\
25 - I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.\\
26 - Oh. Good for you.\\
27 - What brought this on?\\
28 - I realized something-- when Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.\\
29 - And you don't want to make the same mistake with the next woman.\\
30 - No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.\\
31 - Hey, I made French toast sticks.\\
32 - On oatmeal day?\\
33 - Ah, I also made oatmeal.\\
34 - Ooh, that's a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl.\\
35 - You know what? You eat it; you're married-- it doesn't matter what you look like.\\
36 - Don't take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.\\
37 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
38 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
39 -  The Earth began to cool \\
40 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
41 -  We built the Wall \\
42 -  We built the pyramids \\
43 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
44 -  That all started with a big bang \\
45 -  Bang! \\
46 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x08 \\
47 - The Mystery Date Observation\\
48 - Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.\\
49 - No problem.\\
50 - So what's up?\\
51 - Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.\\
52 - Now that I'm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.\\
53 - Y-You sure you're up for that?\\
54 - She did hurt you.\\
55 - Oh, no, it's all right.\\
56 - I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum: sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.\\
57 - You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe.\\
58 - I-I was always a Hubba Bubba man. Mm.\\
59 - Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?\\
60 - You're crazy.\\
61 - Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.\\
62 - Gentlemen!\\
63 - Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.\\
64 - But what are you looking for?\\
65 - All I'm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view.\\
66 - She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by 10:00 tonight.\\
67 - Isn't that a little unreasonable?\\
68 - All right, fine, she doesn't need her own point of view.\\
69 - Now, chop-chop.\\
70 - Come on, Amy, show us the dress.\\
71 - Amy: Okay.\\
72 - But I'm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.\\
73 - Uh...\\
74 - I don't think any of your comfort zones are showing.\\
75 - Yeah, it's your third date-- maybe you could go more sexy.\\
76 - Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.\\
77 - No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.\\
78 - Do you have any heels higher than this?\\
79 - He's pretty tall.\\
80 - Ooh.\\
81 - Ooh, tall!\\
82 - Finally some details about this mystery man.\\
83 - Yeah, come on, tell us more.\\
84 - Well, I told you his name and that he's tall.\\
85 - What more do you need?\\
86 - Did you kiss him yet?\\
87 - Just a little peck on the lips.\\
88 - (both squeal)\\
89 - Well, we're your best friends-- give us one more detail and we promise we'll leave you alone.\\
90 - Fine. Um... he's British.\\
91 - (both squeal)\\
92 - (chuckling): All right, that is a juicy one.\\
93 - All right, where is Tall British Dave taking you?\\
94 - Tea and basketball?\\
95 - To that new Italian place on Walnut.\\
96 - Oh, nice.\\
97 - I'm gonna go look for other shoes.\\
98 - Good luck.\\
99 - I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.\\
100 - Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?\\
101 - We don't even know what time they're gonna be there.\\
102 - I'll just call the restaurant, pretend I'm Amy and check the reservation.\\
103 - Damn, you're sneaky.\\
104 - Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.\\
105 - I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.\\
106 - Are you sure?\\
107 - I've heard that on those sites, often when you think you're corresponding with someone, it's actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.\\
108 - And you're afraid it'll do a better job than you?\\
109 - Excuse me.\\
110 - No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do.\\
111 - Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.\\
112 - If you don't want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?\\
113 - Off the top of my head?\\
114 - Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.\\
115 - You seriously think women would fight for you?\\
116 - People compete for jobs and trophies-- why not me?\\
117 - He's right-- he knows a lot of jokes.\\
118 - Yeah-- no, but it is basic human nature.\\
119 - If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.\\
120 - Well, he's smart, he's a respected scientist...\\
121 - And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.\\
122 - I don't know if I'd say you...\\
123 - Oh.\\
124 - I have an idea.\\
125 - What if we put a post on Craigslist that says: "World-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend.\\
126 - "If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."\\
127 - Oh, we'll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.\\
128 - Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon's contact information.\\
129 - Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.\\
130 - I'm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.\\
131 - Me, too.\\
132 - And we've seen the prize.\\
133 - I don't understand why we're leaving so early for the movie.\\
134 - Oh, I forgot to tell you-- we're gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.\\
135 - What?\\
136 - I don't want to do that.\\
137 - What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminum can recycling?\\
138 - This is the movie Big Soda doesn't want you to see.\\
139 - No, it's the movie your wife doesn't want you to see.\\
140 - So you're actually okay with invading your friend's privacy?\\
141 - You're not curious who she's out with?\\
142 - Not really.\\
143 - But you're curious about aluminum cans.\\
144 - You're a weird little guy.\\
145 - That's it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially alive. (chuckles)\\
146 - Congratulations.\\
147 - This is exciting.\\
148 - Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colors in the oldest national flag still in use...\\
149 - W-- then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.\\
150 - And... taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.\\
151 - I-I hope we didn't make the puzzles too hard.\\
152 - Well... if she can solve them, it'll prove she's intelligent, tenacious and... so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.\\
153 - Golly, she sounds too good to be true.\\
154 - This is fun.\\
155 - I haven't dated much since my divorce.\\
156 - Well, I'm having a good time, too.\\
157 - If you don't mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?\\
158 - Oh, you know how it is-- we wanted different things.\\
159 - I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.\\
160 - Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.\\
161 - No, it's-it's fine.\\
162 - It's why I left England.\\
163 - It reminded me too much of her.\\
164 - Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.\\
165 - Hey. So, where are they?\\
166 - Across the street, in the left window.\\
167 - Penny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.\\
168 - Right here.\\
169 - We just happen to have those in the car?\\
170 - Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.\\
171 - By stalking them?\\
172 - No. Stalkers are creepy.\\
173 - I'm just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.\\
174 - Penny: Oh, there he is.\\
175 - Bernadette: He's cute, right?\\
176 - Yeah!\\
177 - Can I see?\\
178 - What, now you're interested?\\
179 - You didn't even want to come.\\
180 - I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.\\
181 - Fine.\\
182 - Leonard: Yeah, okay, I see him.\\
183 - It looks like they're having a nice time.\\
184 - I wish I could hear what they're saying.\\
185 - Yeah, I should've brought my parabolic microphone.\\
186 - Your what?\\
187 - Nothing. Not important.\\
188 - So you've never been married?\\
189 - No. I mean, to be completely honest, I've...\\
190 - I've only been in one long-term relationship.\\
191 - Oh. What happened with that?\\
192 - That's a good question.\\
193 - After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.\\
194 - Oh, that's too bad.\\
195 - Was he a neurobiologist like you?\\
196 - No. He's a theoretical physicist at Caltech.\\
197 - I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job.\\
198 - What's his focus?\\
199 - Um... used to be string theory, now it's dark matter.\\
200 - But... let's not discuss Sheldon.\\
201 - Let's get back to you.\\
202 - Wait, you're not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?\\
203 - I'm trying not to.\\
204 - Do you know him?\\
205 - No, but I've followed his work for years.\\
206 - He's a rock star.\\
207 - You've got to tell me about him.\\
208 - What's he like?\\
209 - (door opens)\\
210 - He really seems into her.\\
211 - I took a video.\\
212 - I forgot how much fun this is.\\
213 - Okay, we saw them.\\
214 - Can we go catch the movie?\\
215 - (Penny sighs)\\
216 - Why'd you bring him?\\
217 - I had to; we're married now.\\
218 - Ugh, I hear that.\\
219 - I'm sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.\\
220 - Sure, why not?\\
221 - It's more of a four-part question, really.\\
222 - When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?\\
223 - Um... about an hour and half.\\
224 - Wow!\\
225 - I mean, wow!\\
226 - And you were there to see it?\\
227 - Yes. Yep. We were on a date.\\
228 - Very much like this one.\\
229 - Mm.\\
230 - I doubt it was like this one.\\
231 - I mean, he's a genius, and I wasn't even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.\\
232 - What was the rest of your question?\\
233 - Do you think you could introduce me to him?\\
234 - Really?\\
235 - You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?\\
236 - You're right, it's-it's weird.\\
237 - No, wait. Do it.\\
238 - No. I changed my mind.\\
239 - I'd be too nervous.\\
240 - Oh! I don't know what to do.\\
241 - Are we gonna be much longer?\\
242 - I really have to go to the bathroom.\\
243 - Right here.\\
244 - 37 minutes left until the deadline.\\
245 - Someone will show.\\
246 - And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.\\
247 - Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave.\\
248 - We really have led full lives.\\
249 - Someone will show.\\
250 - Maybe you don't want someone exactly like you.\\
251 - You know what they say: opposites attract.\\
252 - Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh?\\
253 - Not to cast aspersions, but I can't shake a stick around here without hitting that.\\
254 - You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.\\
255 - I have a DVD of that lecture.\\
256 - Really? Wasn't it great?\\
257 - Not as a Valentine's present, no.\\
258 - Well, the next time you watch it, I'm the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious.\\
259 - It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.\\
260 - That's, um, terrific.\\
261 - Listen, I'm-I'm kind of tired.\\
262 - Can we call it a night?\\
263 - Oh, gosh. Sorry, I've just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend.\\
264 - I'm such an idiot.\\
265 - No, you're not.\\
266 - Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as... someone we won't mention.\\
267 - Thank you.\\
268 - But you said you might introduce me to him--\\
269 - I'm free on Thursday.\\
270 - Hey, hey, they're leaving.\\
271 - What? Here, give me, give me.\\
272 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're coming right towards us.\\
273 - We got to get out of here.\\
274 - Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?\\
275 - He and his tiny bladder can take the bus!\\
276 - (starts engine)\\
277 - (both gasp)\\
278 - Oh, no!\\
279 - (turns off engine)\\
280 - She just hit my car!\\
281 - What are you guys doing here?\\
282 - Oh! Hey, Ames!\\
283 - What are you doing here?\\
284 - Leonard: What happened?\\
285 - OMG!\\
286 - Aren't you Leonard Hofstadter?\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper!\\
289 - Amy, can you believe it?\\
290 - It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!\\
291 - No. Pinch me.\\
292 - It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.\\
293 - Can I shake your hand?\\
294 - I don't know if you want to do that-- I was just...\\
295 - Okay, never mind.\\
296 - Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.\\
297 - You really should.\\
298 - 60 seconds.\\
299 - This is not looking good.\\
300 - One minute is a long time.\\
301 - I've been telling women that for 20 years.\\
302 - 45.\\
303 - 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me.\\
304 - You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.\\
305 - 30 seconds.\\
306 - Uh-oh.\\
307 - What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?\\
308 - What?\\
309 - Oh, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.\\
310 - You thought she was great in X-Men.\\
311 - Oh, fine-- I won't shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.\\
312 - Guys, 15 seconds.\\
313 - Maybe she's waiting to show up at the last possible moment.\\
314 - (groans)\\
315 - Sounds like a drama queen.\\
316 - Oh, no.\\
317 - It is Jennifer Lawrence.\\
318 - Five... four... three... two... one.\\
319 - That's too bad.\\
320 - Maybe we did make the test too difficult.\\
321 - I don't think it matters.\\
322 - Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it'll just happen.\\
323 - Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, (knocking) but because...\\
324 - We are the dreamers of dreams!\\
325 - It's an actual girl, and she's really pretty.\\
326 - Answer it!\\
327 - All right.\\
328 - Can I help you?\\
329 - Um, a-are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?\\
330 - Yes.\\
331 - Hi. I'm Vanessa Bennett.\\
332 - Sorry it took a while for me to get here.\\
333 - I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night.\\
334 - The puzzles were... were really fun.\\
335 - I've never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.\\
336 - Well... careful, hmm, it's addictive.\\
337 - Chija''e'vlKub je.\\
338 - Or, as they say in Sanskrit...\\
339 - Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.\\
340 - And just like that, you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.\\
341 - Anyway, I-I just... I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea.\\
342 - And I don't need to tell you, there aren't a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.\\
343 - I am a bit of a unicorn.\\
344 - Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.\\
345 - How could you send her away?!\\
346 - She was late.\\
347 - And... she found atomic spectroscopy boring.\\
348 - Well, I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.\\
349 - Uh, thanks for driving me home.\\
350 - No problem.\\
351 - I'm really sorry about your car.\\
352 - Oh, it's all right.\\
353 - If you're free next weekend, I'd love to take you out again.\\
354 - Um... listen, you're a really nice guy, but I just... I don't think this is working out.\\
355 - Oh. Okay.\\
356 - (sighs): I'm...\\
357 - I'm really sorry.\\
358 - No, it's... at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.\\
359 - There you go. (awkward chuckle)\\
360 - If I ever do meet him, we'll have that in common.\\
361 - Sure. Heh.\\
362 - And... he's kissed you and I've kissed you, so if you think about it...\\
363 - Okay, get out.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Platonic Permutation}
1 - Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?\\
2 - No. How does it work?\\
3 - You just say, uh, “Hey, Siri, what time is it?”\\
4 - Siri: The time is 6:37 p.m.\\
5 - Yeah.\\
6 - So now anyone can control your phone?\\
7 - Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.\\
8 - Nice try.\\
9 - It only recognizes my voice.\\
10 - Oh. Cool.\\
11 - (imitates Koothrappali): Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.\\
12 - I don't sound like that.\\
13 - Siri: Here are some images of naked grandma butts.\\
14 - Hey. Good news, everybody.\\
15 - Now that I'm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it?\\
16 - Well, you realize you won't be going alone--\\
17 - I'll be there the whole time.\\
18 - Providing fish and pilgrim facts.\\
19 - Can you people hear me?\\
20 - Well, we're having everyone over.\\
21 - Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day. Otherwise we'd love to.\\
22 - But we can't.\\
23 - Yeah, poor us.\\
24 - Mm-hmm.\\
25 - And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.\\
26 - Well, Howard, what about you?\\
27 - Oh...\\
28 - I can't. I'm going to the soup kitchen, too.\\
29 - You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.\\
30 - If you can't support me when I'm lying, why are we married?\\
31 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
32 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
33 -  The Earth began to cool \\
34 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
35 -  We built the Wall \\
36 -  We built the pyramids \\
37 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
38 -  That all started with a big bang \\
39 -  Bang! \\

43 - (phone line ringing)\\
44 - Hi, Sheldon. What's?\\
45 - Well, I'm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.\\
46 - No one can go with you?\\
47 - No. They'd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish.\\
48 - Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you'd like.\\
49 - Oh.\\
50 - Okay. Thank you.\\
51 - And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish.\\
52 - In case the turkey's dry and you need something juicy.\\
53 - Sheldon... I can tell you want to go, so if you'd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.\\
54 - You don't think that will be awkward?\\
55 - Well... it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes.\\
56 - But if you mean between us...\\
57 - I think it'll be fine.\\
58 - Very well, then.\\
59 - I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.\\
60 - See you then. Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish.\\
61 - My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.\\
62 - Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?\\
63 - And there goes my list.\\
64 - So, how does this work?\\
65 - The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.\\
66 - Six hours?\\
67 - Oh, God, I don't want to complain for that long.\\
68 - Do you ever do anything for anyone else?\\
69 - I happen to be a giving and generous lover.\\
70 - Are you and I close enough for me to say that's creepy?\\
71 - We are, and I believe the word you're looking for is... yech!\\
72 - Uh, can I help you?\\
73 - Hi. We'd like to volunteer.\\
74 - Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people.\\
75 - Any other day, please, come back.\\
76 - Oh. Okay.\\
77 - Wipe that smug smile off your face.\\
78 - Maybe I'm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.\\
79 - (chuckles)\\
80 - Are you and I close enough for me to say...\\
81 - That he's an ass?\\
82 - He beat you to it.\\
83 - I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.\\
84 - Oh, great. We'd love to help.\\
85 - Wipe that smug smile off your face.\\
86 - (laughing): I can't!\\
87 - Look at us!\\
88 - Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.\\
89 - I know.\\
90 - I feel so grown up.\\
91 - Sweetie, you are grown up.\\
92 - Really?\\
93 - How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?\\
94 - Hey, the recipes are on my iPad.\\
95 - Will you pull 'em up?\\
96 - Yep.\\
97 - What's the code?\\
98 - My birthday.\\
99 - It's not working.\\
100 - It's just the four digits-- month and day.\\
101 - Nope.\\
102 - Let me see.\\
103 - Yeah, there.\\
104 - What number were you putting in?\\
105 - Uh...\\
106 - You don't know my birthday, do you?\\
107 - Yes, I do.\\
108 - Well, what is it?\\
109 - May.\\
110 - May what?\\
111 - I'm not gonna say your password out loud.\\
112 - That is not secure.\\
113 - You don't know your own husband's birthday.\\
114 - Well... you don't know everything about me.\\
115 - Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7-6-2-1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.\\
116 - Oh, look at us.\\
117 - Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.\\
118 - Hello.\\
119 - Hi.\\
120 - Ready for the aquarium?\\
121 - I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.\\
122 - If that makes you more comfortable.\\
123 - If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list.\\
124 - Okay, now... Oh.\\
125 - "Since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"\\
126 - No. You?\\
127 - No.\\
128 - Um, "Since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"\\
129 - I might go visit my aunt next week.\\
130 - Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?\\
131 - No, the one in Bakersfield.\\
132 - Bakersfield. I see.\\
133 - Where has this list been all my life?\\
134 - We're gonna have you washing dishes.\\
135 - Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here-- just... scrape, wash and stack.\\
136 - If you need me, I'll be around.\\
137 - So we don't even get to be up front where the action is?\\
138 - What difference does it make?\\
139 - I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, (high-pitched British accent): Please, sir, I want some more.\\
140 - You're in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!\\
141 - It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.\\
142 - ...and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again... uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at--\\
143 - I'd wear shorts if I had a pair-- 78.\\
144 - Are we done discussing the weather?\\
145 - I don't know if I'd call it "discussing."\\
146 - You kind of sat back and let me do all the work.\\
147 - Let's see what's next on the list.\\
148 - Oh, here.\\
149 - Uh, "Do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you..."\\
150 - Sheldon.\\
151 - We've known each other a long time.\\
152 - We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.\\
153 - All right.\\
154 - Well, what should we talk about?\\
155 - I don't know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.\\
156 - Very well.\\
157 - I know you've been seeing other men.\\
158 - Have you had coitus with any of them?\\
159 - Man, I walked right into that one.\\
160 - Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I  believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.\\
161 - Fine. You think you know so much.\\
162 - Who's my favorite Spice Girl?\\
163 - Baby.\\
164 - Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?\\
165 - Justin.\\
166 - Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?\\
167 - (scoffs): Nice try. NSYNC forever.\\
168 - Damn it!\\
169 - (grunts) Face it, you can't stump me-- I am the king of husbands.\\
170 - I know that you don't like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine's Day.\\
171 - I know you hate the word "moist." I know...\\
172 - Hang on.\\
173 - Wait, wait. Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?\\
174 - Because it's orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.\\
175 - Interesting. I never told you that.\\
176 - Sure you did.\\
177 - No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.\\
178 - (high-pitched): What?\\
179 - (high-pitched): I didn't know you had a journal.\\
180 - I also know your voice gets higher when you're lying.\\
181 - (deeply): No, it doesn't.\\
182 - You know, this reminds me of high school.\\
183 - You worked in a restaurant?\\
184 - No, I was in India-- it was humid and smelled funny.\\
185 - All right, I think I'm getting into a groove here.\\
186 - This isn't so bad.\\
187 - Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.\\
188 - We've only been doing this 20 minutes?!\\
189 - You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation.\\
190 - The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be... washing the dishes.\\
191 - Just because you have that accent doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.\\
192 - No, seriously.\\
193 - It's about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath.\\
194 - It's about... it's about simply being.\\
195 - Ah. (chuckles)\\
196 - Okay..I'll try  t.\\
197 - (all inhale deeply)\\
198 - (all exhale)\\
199 - I need three people out front.\\
200 - I'll do it! Me! Right here!\\
201 - No fair! I was meditating!\\
202 - Come on, don't be mad.\\
203 - It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.\\
204 - How can reading my journal be an accident?\\
205 - I didn't even know what it was.\\
206 - I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.\\
207 - Well, when you realized what it was, why didn't you stop?\\
208 - You know me, I'm a big ol' bookworm.\\
209 - All right. Let's just finish cooking.\\
210 - Well... Hey. O-Okay. Let me make this up to you.\\
211 - Sometimes I keep an online journal.\\
212 - I want you to read something that I write.\\
213 - Okay, really, I'm fine. Okay.\\
214 - Well, then I'll read it to you.\\
215 - It's from the day we first met.\\
216 - (clears throat)\\
217 - "Beauty, thy name is Penny." Oh, God.\\
218 - Stop.\\
219 - I don't want you to read something you think'll just butter me up.\\
220 - I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.\\
221 - Fine.\\
222 - Mmm...\\
223 - "Penny's beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day."\\
224 - Does it really say that?\\
225 - (high-pitched): Why would I lie?\\
226 - "OMG. OMG.\\
227 - "We're so close to the new Star Wars.\\
228 - "I can't take it.\\
229 - Gah."\\
230 - "Gah"?\\
231 - Well, you didn't read it right.\\
232 - The new Star Wars is coming. Gah!\\
233 - I'm sensing things have gotten awkward.\\
234 - No. It's okay.\\
235 - If we're friends, we should be able to talk about anything.\\
236 - All right.\\
237 - So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.\\
238 - Just a few.\\
239 - Go ahead.\\
240 - How many dates have you been on?\\
241 - Who were they with? Where'd you go?\\
242 - Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them?\\
243 - And how much longer to the aquarium?\\
244 - I'm getting kind of hungry.\\
245 - Let's see.\\
246 - I have been on six dates with three different people.\\
247 - It was either for coffee or dinner.\\
248 - One I met at a bookstore and two I met online.\\
249 - I haven't slept with anyone.\\
250 - The aquarium is 40 minutes away.\\
251 - And there's a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.\\
252 - Uh, regular or honey nut?\\
253 - I mixed them.\\
254 - You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door.\\
255 - Do you have any questions for me?\\
256 - Just one.\\
257 - Are you doing okay?\\
258 - I am.\\
259 - Good.\\
260 - I-I want you to be happy.\\
261 - I believe you.\\
262 - I'd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.\\
263 - Here you go.\\
264 - Thanks.\\
265 - You got to be kidding me.\\
266 - Sorry?\\
267 - Y-You're Elon Musk.\\
268 - I am.\\
269 - Wh-What are you doing here?\\
270 - I'm washing dishes.\\
271 - Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.\\
272 - (chuckles)\\
273 - Oh, man. I... (chuckles)\\
274 - What an honor to meet you.\\
275 - I'm-I'm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX.\\
276 - All your companies.\\
277 - Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.\\
278 - Nice to meet you, Howard.\\
279 - Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?\\
280 - Oh, yeah.\\
281 - Nothing better than helping people.\\
282 - Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.\\
283 - And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.\\
284 - Sorry. It's just... you're you, you know?\\
285 - And I really want you to adopt me.\\
286 - Well, you're here on Thanksgiving, so you're probably a good person.\\
287 - Oh. I made my wife come down, too.\\
288 - You think you might ever get back out to space?\\
289 - Is that a job offer? 'Cause I really want to go to Mars.\\
290 - Assuming I can bring my wife.\\
291 - She hardly takes up any room.\\
292 - She's basically a carry-on.\\
293 - Well, we're not quite there yet, but we're always looking for engineers.\\
294 - So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.\\
295 - Thank you.\\
296 - Oh, look.\\
297 - Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.\\
298 - Want to share it with me?\\
299 - A-a partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter?\\
300 - With Elon Musk, you bet I do!\\
301 - (both chuckling)\\
302 - You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.\\
303 - You're just upset 'cause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.\\
304 - They gave one to that baby. He wasn't even awake.\\
305 - Well, it wouldn't be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?\\
308 - Sure. What is it?\\
309 - It's called Food, Friend, Fight.\\
310 - One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.\\
311 - So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.\\
312 - What is that?\\
313 - It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.\\
314 - Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.\\
315 - Let's just play.\\
316 - I'll start you off easy.\\
317 - Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.\\
318 - Hmm. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.\\
319 - So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.\\
320 - Very well done.\\
321 - Thank you.\\
322 - Okay, your turn.\\
323 - Hmm. Seal, hagfish...\\
324 - SpongeBob SquarePants.\\
325 - Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob but he's not real, so I can't do that, can I?\\
326 - But you can pal around with a hagfish?\\
327 - Hey, let's not pull at that thread.\\
328 - Okay. I'll fight SpongeBob, because he's so friendly we'll just end up tickling each other.\\
329 - Um, I'll befriend the seal, because he's trainable, which is the problem I'm having with my current friends.\\
330 - Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.\\
331 - Isn't that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.\\
332 - I know. It makes its own gravy-- it'll slide right down.\\
333 - I miss this.\\
334 - How can you miss a game you've never played before, silly?\\
335 - I guess sometimes I'm silly.\\
336 - Hey. Where'd you go? I can't tell if the turkey's done!\\
337 - Be right there!\\
338 - Hi, lover.\\
339 - What are you doing?\\
340 - I'm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you.\\
341 - So I'm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.\\
342 - I am not putting that on the Internet!\\
343 - I don't want people to see this.\\
344 - I don't want to see it!\\
345 - Don't want people to see what, huh?\\
346 - A little bit of this?\\
347 - Oh...\\
348 - Huh?\\
349 - Some of this?\\
350 - And, since it's Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?\\
351 - Happy Thanks... Yikes.\\
352 - I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.\\
353 - Me, too. It's comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.\\
354 - Well, I've never been friends with any of my exes.\\
355 - Oh, I'm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.\\
356 - (phone rings)\\
357 - Oh. It's my friend Amy.\\
358 - Hello.\\
359 - Hi, Sheldon.\\
360 - I'm just driving home from my mother's.\\
361 - Did you have a nice time?\\
362 - I did. Um... listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.\\
363 - Well, I can't take all the credit.\\
364 - It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way. (chuckles)\\
365 - (chuckles) It was.\\
366 - Uh, listen, I-I was thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready to be your girlfriend again.\\
367 - Oh.\\
368 - I thought we were just friends.\\
369 - We are.\\
370 - But I was hoping, maybe...\\
371 - Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn't one of them.\\
372 - I think I need to just be your friend.\\
373 - Okay.\\
374 - I understand.\\
375 - (shuddering breath)\\
376 - Good.\\
377 - Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I'm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.\\
378 - Okay. Sure.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Earworm Reverberation}
1 - Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness... day two.\\
2 - It's 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate.\\
3 - My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry.\\
4 - It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.\\
5 - I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.\\
6 - (hums tune)\\
7 - (repeats tune)\\
8 - (repeats tune)\\
9 - Since when do you hum songs?\\
10 - What are you talking about?\\
11 - You were just humming.\\
12 - Are you sure?\\
13 - Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.\\
14 - How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?\\
15 - Let's see.\\
16 - (begins tune)\\
17 - Hey! I was humming.\\
18 - One point for Hufflepuff.\\
19 - (repeats tune)\\
20 - What song is that?\\
21 - Well... Hum it again.\\
22 - (repeats tune)\\
23 - Is that the SpongeBob song?\\
24 - (to same tune):  Who lives in a pineapple  Nope.\\
25 - Whatever. Can we just get back to this?\\
26 - I feel like I know what song that is, but I can't put my finger on it.\\
27 -  My country, 'tis of thee \\
28 - No.\\
29 - It's just an earworm. It'll come to you.\\
30 - Okay.\\
31 -  R-E-S-P-E-C-T \\
32 - No.\\
33 - Is this what we're doing the rest of the night?\\
34 -  I'm surprised you have to ask... \\
35 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
36 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
37 -  The Earth began to cool \\
38 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
39 -  We built the Wall \\
40 -  We built the pyramids \\
41 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
42 -  That all started with a big bang \\
43 -  Bang! \\
44 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x10 \\
45 - The Earworm Reverberation\\
46 - Original Air Date on December 1\\
47 - Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me.\\
48 - What song is this?\\
49 -  La, la, la, la, la, la, la. \\
50 - You don't know?\\
51 - Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?\\
52 - My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth?\\
53 - Well, they were no help at all. Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.\\
54 - Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head.\\
55 - It happens to everybody.\\
56 - Well, I'm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory.\\
57 - I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can't.\\
58 - Something's wrong with me.\\
59 - I told you if we were patient, he'd figure it out for himself.\\
60 - Oh... I was always afraid this day would come.\\
61 - This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.\\
62 - Public nudity?\\
63 - Eh, that just means going barefoot.\\
64 - (sighs)\\
65 - (phone line ringing)\\
66 - Hello?\\
67 - Hi, Dave.\\
68 - Uh, it's Amy.\\
69 - Oh. How are you?\\
70 - I'm fine. How are you?\\
71 - Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.\\
72 - Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know.\\
73 - I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.\\
74 - So, to what do I owe the pleasure?\\
75 - Well, I was wondering if you'd like to get dinner again sometime.\\
76 - Yes, please.\\
77 - Great. Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.\\
78 - How 'bout Saturday?\\
79 - Uh, hmm...\\
80 - Let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers' market with Jay Z.\\
81 - Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John.\\
82 - Saturday works.\\
83 - Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there's a Department for Outer Space Affairs?\\
84 - Really? Why?\\
85 - They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.\\
86 - Mm, boy, that's one of those jobs that's boring, boring, boring, then, "Oh, God!\\
87 - Where's the memo with what we do now?!"\\
88 - (phone chimes)\\
89 - Oh, this is cool.\\
90 - So, a few weeks ago, I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and...\\
91 - Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?\\
92 - It's not a big deal.\\
93 - It just took, like, five minutes to set up.\\
94 - That's not the point.\\
95 - When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual.\\
96 - Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing.\\
97 - You know, maybe I should go solo.\\
98 - But someone joined our page.\\
99 - We have an actual fan.\\
100 - All right.\\
101 - This thing's bigger than you and me-- band's back together.\\
102 - So, listen to what he wrote.\\
103 - Uh, "I saw you play at the comic book store.\\
104 - You guys rock."\\
105 - And then there's a animated smiley face raising the roof like this...\\
106 - We did raise the roof that night.\\
107 - Yeah, we totally did.\\
108 - Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great? (chuckles)\\
109 -  Why can't I recall this song? \\
110 -  This is taking far too long. \\
111 -  The urge to bang my head against the wall \\
112 -  Again and again and again and again and again is strong. \\
113 - Put on some headphones.\\
114 -  No \\
115 -  They make my earlobes sweat. \\
116 - Uh, sweetie, why don't you take a break and do something else for a while?\\
117 - There was a project I've been thinking about starting.\\
118 - Okay, great. What is it?\\
119 - I'll show you.\\
120 - Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm.\\
121 - Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys.\\
122 - So... I'm going to tell you everything you need to know.\\
123 - Uh, first, music is dangerous.\\
124 - The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn't listen.\\
125 - Oh, wait.\\
126 -  Everybody cut footloo... \\
127 - Nope.\\
128 - I'll pay $1,000 to watch you cut footloose.\\
129 - This is Penny.\\
130 - She is your friend.\\
131 - If she offers you food, it's safe to take it.\\
132 - You probably paid for it, anyway.\\
133 - So, you're really going out with Dave again?\\
134 - Why not?\\
135 - He's actually a very nice guy.\\
136 - But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.\\
137 - That's nothing Sheldon hasn't done before.\\
138 - Dave's just a big fan of his work.\\
139 - Besides, he said he wouldn't bring it up again.\\
140 - Okay. So where's he taking you?\\
141 - Oh, he's coming here. I'm actually making dinner.\\
142 - Oh. That's a big step.\\
143 - It is?\\
144 - Yeah. You're inviting him into your home.\\
145 - It's intimate.\\
146 - It's where your underpants live.\\
147 - You know what? Good.\\
148 - I tried to get back together with Sheldon; he shot me down; Dave likes me.\\
149 - Maybe intimate is what I need.\\
150 - You sure?\\
151 - You've never really been with a man.\\
152 - Do you really want to start with one that's six-foot-seven?\\
153 - Why not?\\
154 - 'Cause it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.\\
155 - Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.\\
156 - What should we write?\\
157 - How 'bout, uh... Oh, how 'bout, "We might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."\\
158 - Someday you're gonna make an amazing grandma.\\
159 - What do you want to write?\\
160 - Something bad-ass, you know, like...\\
161 - "Thanks for diggin' our vibe. We'll keep rockin' if you keep rollin'."\\
162 - Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I'd throw it at your head right now.\\
163 - I'll keep rockin'.\\
164 - You don't do that.\\
165 - Okay. I posted it.\\
166 - So, who is this guy?\\
167 - Let's see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.\\
168 - Cool name.\\
169 - Yeah.\\
170 - He's 24. He's a deejay.\\
171 - He brews his own beer. He's got awesome tattoos. Dude, he's got a hot girlfriend, too.\\
172 - Damn. I don't know if he's our biggest fan or I'm his.\\
173 - (phone chimes)\\
174 - Hey, Trent just liked our comment.\\
175 - He is so cool!\\
176 - No hard feelings, but I'm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.\\
177 - (tune playing on keyboard in distance)\\
178 - (tune repeating, slower)\\
179 - Oh, my God, he won't stop.\\
180 - How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?\\
181 - Nobody knows. That's why he's number one.\\
182 - Can you please go talk to him?\\
183 - Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.\\
184 - Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?\\
185 - What do you want, a medal?\\
186 - It was your gum.\\
187 - Fine. (groans)\\
188 - I love you.\\
189 - Who cares?\\
190 - (tune repeating)\\
191 - Sheldon: What are you doing in my room? I...\\
192 - (banging on keys; discordant notes sounding)\\
193 - Stop it! That's mine!\\
194 - Why are you so strong?!\\
195 - (keyboard plays discordant notes)\\
196 - Problem solved.\\
197 - (groans)\\
198 - (grunts)\\
199 - (sighs)\\
200 - (tune playing on tuba in distance)\\
201 - Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.\\
202 - (tune repeats)\\
203 - Dear Crazy Future Sheldon... this is a thermostat.\\
204 - It controls the temperature of the apartment.\\
205 - The ideal setting is 72 degrees.\\
206 - If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket.\\
207 - A straitjacket, 'cause 72's the best and you're crazy.\\
208 - Now... this... is your spot.\\
209 - You're very protective of it.\\
210 - When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly.\\
211 - It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable.\\
212 - People are also delighted by your love of pranks.\\
213 - (quietly): For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee.\\
214 - It wasn't "replace it with Folger's crystals,"\\
215 - I'll tell you that much.\\
216 - Hey, can we please get back to work?\\
217 - This is Leonard.\\
218 - He's your best friend in the world.\\
219 - All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.\\
220 - Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life.\\
221 - And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.\\
222 - Thank you.\\
223 - Oh, no, he's drinking it.\\
224 - (gunfire sounding on videogame)\\
225 - Look at this.\\
226 - Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.\\
227 - Hmm. That is so cool!\\
228 - Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.\\
229 - Who's Trent?\\
230 - Oh, he's our fan.\\
231 - Fan of what?\\
232 - Wolowitz: Uh...\\
233 - (laughs): Did you forget? We're in a band.\\
234 - You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?\\
235 - And at the children's hospital until they asked us to leave.\\
236 - Koothrappali: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.\\
237 - Really? You want to go down there and meet him?\\
238 - Are you stalking him? That's creepy.\\
239 - It's not creepy.\\
240 - I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.\\
241 - After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.\\
242 - From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.\\
243 - So if you think that's creepy, you married the wrong guy.\\
244 - Maybe I should marry Trent.\\
245 - Yeah, like she could get Trent.\\
246 - (laughing)\\
247 - This is delicious.\\
248 - Thank you.\\
249 - Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.\\
250 - When you were married, did your wife cook?\\
251 - Not at first, no.\\
252 - But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in t kitchen.\\
253 - So, a little silver lining.\\
254 - I suppose.\\
255 - Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup.\\
256 - How long have you, uh, lived here?\\
257 - About five years.\\
258 - I'm actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don't need to be so close to...\\
259 - Well, you know.\\
260 - I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.\\
261 - Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.\\
262 - Had to or got to?\\
263 - Sorry.\\
264 - My fault. I brought him up.\\
265 - Yeah.\\
266 - Well, let's change the subject.\\
267 - No more mentions of you-know-who.\\
268 - (laughs) That's a cool train.\\
269 - Where did you get that?\\
270 -  Bah, bah, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. \\
271 - (humming tune)\\
272 - (gargling song)\\
273 - This song is never going to stop.\\
274 - Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?\\
275 - That's a trick question, right?\\
276 - Well, I shouldn't be surprised.\\
277 - There's a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.\\
278 - Penny: Come on, Sheldon.\\
279 - There are plenty of smart people who don't have mental problems.\\
280 - Yup, she's right.\\
281 - For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there's an Edison who was just a jerk.\\
282 - That could totally be you.\\
283 - Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano.\\
284 - And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans.\\
285 - Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.\\
286 - Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.\\
287 - The list extends outside of science.\\
288 - Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boy...\\
289 - (upbeat pop melody playing)\\
290 -  ...Know if words could say \\
291 -  But darlin', I'll find a way... \\
292 - I remember the song!\\
293 - It's called "Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!\\
294 - Oh, thank goodness!\\
295 - I'm not crazy!\\
296 - I don't have to take a pigeon as my bride!\\
297 - There goes our shot at him living on the roof.\\
298 - So, all right, there he is.\\
299 - So, should we introduce ourselves?\\
300 - No! Let him spot us.\\
301 - Koothrappali: I wonder if he's listening to our music right now.\\
302 - Could you imagine?\\
303 - What a cool way for us to meet.\\
304 - He's playing our song and looks up, and there we are-- his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.\\
305 - And he's, all, like, "Aren't you the guys from Footprints on the Moo...?"\\
306 - Ooh, what is he doing?!\\
307 - I can't watch.\\
308 - I-I-It's okay.\\
309 - Oh, it's okay. He's done.\\
310 - Why is he looking at it?!\\
311 - Eh, no, he's not going to eat it, is he?\\
312 - Come on, Trent, you're better than...\\
313 - (both groaning)\\
314 - Let's just go.\\
315 - Hey, aren't you the guys...?\\
316 - Nope! Never heard of 'em!\\
317 -  ...Know if words could say \\
318 -  But darlin', I'll find a way... \\
319 - I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.\\
320 - I don't know. It's pretty catchy.\\
321 - Do you even like the Beach Boys?\\
322 - They have "beach" right in the name.\\
323 - What do you think?\\
324 - Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?\\
325 - Of course. I'm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi...\\
326 - I know why the song was in my head.\\
327 - Why? It's about Amy.\\
328 - Okay, look, I know Amy's like an old lady, but she's not old enough to have a song from the '60s written about her.\\
329 - It's about how she made my life better.\\
330 - Consider the lyrics.\\
331 - "I was living like half a man. Then I couldn't love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life."\\
332 - Well, she did soften your life, didn't she?\\
333 - Yes!\\
334 - She's like the dryer sheets of my heart!\\
335 - I have to go.\\
336 - Aw.\\
337 - Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?\\
338 - Better. You're the lint trap of my love.\\
339 - Aw.\\
340 - That's an interesting tie clip.\\
341 - Oh, thanks.\\
342 - It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.\\
343 - It's useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.\\
344 - Oh, I...\\
345 - I think it's neat.\\
346 - Oh! Sorry. Sorry.\\
347 - No one's ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control. I...\\
348 - No, it... it's okay, and we are on a date.\\
349 - I'm... I'm just a little nervous.\\
350 - Well, no need to be nervous with me.\\
351 - I'm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.\\
352 - You know, I'm just being silly. I...\\
353 - I don't know what I'm waiting for.\\
354 - (knocking)\\
355 - Sheldon: Amy? (knocking) Amy. (knocking) Amy?\\
356 - That's Sheldon.\\
357 - You're kidding! How's my hair?\\
358 - Sheldon, this-this isn't a good time.\\
359 - I don't care.\\
360 - Amy, there was a song I couldn't get out of my head.\\
361 - Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can't get you out of my heart.\\
362 - So, what I'm trying to say is, you're my heartworm.\\
363 - The metaphorical kind, not-not the poodle-killing kind.\\
364 - W-W-W-What?\\
365 - If I may...\\
366 - I believe what he's saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back.\\
367 - Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work.\\
368 - Oh. Don't mind me.\\
369 - I'm-I'm sorry; I didn't realize you were on a date.\\
370 - No, it-it... it's okay. Keep going?\\
371 - Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.\\
372 - I really want that, too.\\
373 - Good. Because I love you.\\
374 - I love you, too.\\
375 - Kiss her, you brilliant fool!\\
376 - Well...\\
377 - I'll let you get back to your date.\\
378 - Get back here!\\
379 -  Oh, oh, oh, darlin' \\
380 -  I dream about you often, my pretty darlin' \\
381 -  I love the way you soften my... \\
382 - Okay, then.\\
383 - I'll, uh, see myself out.\\
384 - Amy, thank you for dinner.\\
385 - Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir.\\
386 - Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I'd, uh, love-love to discuss physics, or "shoot the breeze," as you Yanks say.\\
387 - Ah. What a lovely evening.

30 - I'm really happy you and Amy are back together.\\
31 - Oh, thank you.\\
32 - I'm also really happy, but I can't pretend it's for you.\\
33 - New Star Wars in three days!\\
34 - Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.\\
35 - I'm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.\\
36 - Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy's birthday.\\
37 - And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up?\\
38 - I hope you didn't need anything in that case, 'cause it's closed.\\
39 - You guys just got back together.\\
40 - You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.\\
41 - I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.\\
42 - But someone might spoil the movie.\\
43 - No one can spoil Amy's birthday for me.\\
44 - Surprise! She's even older.\\
45 - Who saw that coming?\\
46 - Oh, that's nice.\\
47 - Put that on her cake.\\
48 - (whirring)\\
49 - Oh, great. This again.\\
50 - Arthur, what brings you back?\\
51 - Uh, beats me. I-I just... hope this isn't a-a s*x dream.\\
52 - In the past, you've come to me when I'm struggling with a dilemma.\\
53 - And-and the one time where... where you were afraid, and you needed me for... for a night light.\\
54 - What's-what's troubling you?\\
55 - Well... my friends are telling me I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.\\
56 - Well, sounds right.\\
57 - Can... can I get out of this... muumuu now?\\
58 - Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.\\
59 - And they... they-they don't wear underwear.\\
60 - So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?\\
61 - Uh, do... do you love this girl?\\
62 - Yes.\\
63 - But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.\\
64 - Well, maybe you should show her how... how important she is to you.\\
65 - By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?\\
66 - Sheldon, you-you can see this movie whenever you want.\\
67 - But you only have a limited number of days that you-you can be with this woman.\\
68 - Be with her.\\
69 - You're right.\\
70 - Great.\\
71 - Where are you going?\\
72 - I don't know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.\\
73 - (cell phone ringtone playing)\\
74 - Sheldon, what's wrong?\\
75 - I wanted to let you know I'll be spending your birthday with you.\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - See, I-I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.\\
78 - Obi-what?\\
79 - I'll-I'll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.\\
80 - Okay. Good night. Wait.\\
81 - Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?\\
82 - It's late. Got to go. Bye.\\
83 - Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday. I know.\\
84 - It's still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.\\
85 - Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.\\
86 - (loud laughter)\\
87 - Hello.\\
88 - Hey. We're going to the comic book store. You want to come?\\
89 - No, I can't.\\
90 - I need to make preparations for Amy's birthday.\\
91 - Which leads me to the following bit of business.\\
92 - This is my ticket to Star Wars.\\
93 - I don't have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of $15.50.\\
94 - I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.\\
95 - You got it.\\
96 - Well, Penny might want to join us.\\
97 - This is my ticket to Star Wars.\\
98 - (knocking)\\
99 - Sheldon: Penny.\\
100 - Penny?\\
101 - (knocking)\\
102 - (knocking)\\
103 - Penny?\\
104 - What happens if I say, “Come in”?\\
105 - Well, find out.\\
106 - Come in!\\
107 - (knocking)\\
108 - Bernadette?\\
109 - (knocking)\\
110 - Bernadette? Bernadette?\\
111 - Come in!\\
112 - Sheldon: Keep it up.\\
113 - I got nowhere else to be.\\
114 - Just come in.\\
115 - For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls,\\
116 - I'll stream it on Netflix.\\
117 - We're sorry.\\
118 - What do you need?\\
119 - Well, as you know, I'll be celebrating Amy's birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.\\
120 - Sure.\\
121 - Well, so far, I've come up with three ideas.\\
122 - The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.\\
123 - Wow. You can really arrange that?\\
124 - Well, I said a chance, you know.\\
125 - When you tell them it's your birthday at Bennigan's, they make a fuss.\\
126 - I don't see why the Philharmonic would be any different.\\
127 - How about something a little more realistic?\\
128 - Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.\\
129 - Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.\\
130 - Hold on. It could be romantic.\\
131 - The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.\\
132 - No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone.\\
133 - Well, if you think I'm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.\\
134 - Okay, well, what's the third option?\\
135 - That I have coitus with her.\\
136 - (glass shatters on floor)\\
137 - What do you think about giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?\\
138 - I don't know.\\
139 - Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?\\
140 - It's like going with your grandpa.\\
141 - Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.\\
142 - He's not that bad.\\
143 - Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?\\
144 - My, uh... my doctor's worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall.\\
145 - Why?\\
146 - Well...\\
147 - Hey, you guys.\\
148 - Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes.\\
149 - Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?\\
150 - Absolutely.\\
151 - Fine, take Wil.\\
152 - See if he brings you clam chowder.\\
153 - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.\\
154 - Let's-let's... let's just recap our options.\\
155 - All right, we've got harp thing, sheep thing...\\
156 - Wild thang.\\
157 - Which do you think she'd prefer?\\
158 - Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there's only 8,000 tickets left.\\
159 - Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.\\
160 - Yeah, are you ready for this?\\
161 - Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I'd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.\\
162 - Sheldon, that's so beautiful.\\
163 - Then it's settled.\\
164 - Amy's birthday present will be my genitals.\\
165 - Thanks for taking me out.\\
166 - Well, you're spending your birthday with Sheldon.\\
167 - Why not celebrate early?\\
168 - So where do you want to go?\\
169 - I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.\\
170 - Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.\\
171 - Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?\\
172 - Uh, I don't know. It was just a thought.\\
173 - I think I'll just stick to Mexican.\\
174 - Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.\\
175 - Okay, what is going on?\\
176 - Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.\\
177 - What surprises?\\
178 - Oh. We don't want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.\\
179 - You shut your damn mouth!\\
180 - You actually heard him say this?\\
181 - Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.\\
182 - (exhales) I-I can't believe it. I...\\
183 - I don't know what to say.\\
184 - Well, we're really happy for you, and we know how much he cares...\\
185 - I do know what to say! Let's get me waxed!\\
186 - (whirring)\\
187 - Why isn't it ever Angie Dickinson's bedroom?\\
188 - You're back.\\
189 - It-it doesn't seem like it's up to me.\\
190 - I suppose you're here because...\\
191 - I've decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I've never done that before.\\
192 - E-Excuse me for a moment.\\
193 - (lightsaber humming)\\
194 - Well, it was worth a shot.\\
195 - So, can you help me?\\
196 - Uh, all right. Um... once-once the man gets the-the woman out of her... out of her bloomers...\\
197 - Oh, no. Not that.\\
198 - I-I understand the mechanics.\\
199 - Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are... calling their-their parts.\\
200 - I think they say “junk.”\\
201 - What is happening to this world?\\
202 - What-what do you actually need to know?\\
203 - This is an important night for us, and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.\\
204 - Sheldon, if-if you're with the right person, it-it'll be okay.\\
205 - Thank you, Arthur.\\
206 - You are the wisest of the wise.\\
207 - Well, that's-that's very nice of you to say, but I think I'm just an expression of... of your unconscious mind.\\
208 - Oh, sure. Yeah.\\
209 - Well, you're fun to look at.\\
210 - Tonight's the night!\\
211 - Yeah, the wait is finally over!\\
212 - I know. Then you'll finally stop talking about it!\\
213 - Ready to go? Let's do this.\\
214 - Have fun, guys!\\
215 - We will.\\
216 - I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.\\
217 - I know.\\
218 - We're gonna have so much more fun than him.\\
219 - (singsongy): No, they're not.\\
220 - Knowing them, they will.\\
221 - (indistinct chatter)\\
222 - T minus 15 minutes!\\
223 - Oh, did you hear from Wil?\\
224 - Yeah, he's on his way. Time for bladder check.\\
225 - Check.\\
226 - Check.\\
227 - Check. Wait.\\
228 - Screw it. I'm holding it.\\
229 - (crowd booing)\\
230 - What is everyone booing at?\\
231 - (booing continues)\\
232 - Hey, guys. What's up?\\
233 - Um, hey, Wil. What you doin'?\\
234 - I was on Star Trek. I'm just rooting for the home team.\\
235 - Man: Star Trek stinks!\\
236 - Yeah? Live long and suck it!\\
237 - (romantic music playing)\\
238 - (knocking)\\
239 - Sheldon: Birthday girl.\\
240 - Birthday girl. Birthday girl.\\
241 - Come in!\\
242 - Oh!\\
243 - Hi, Sheldon.\\
244 - Hello. Sorry I'm late.\\
245 - I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.\\
246 - That's okay. Come on in.\\
247 - Thank you.\\
248 - Mm-hmm.\\
249 - Um, I'll... I'm gonna go put these in water.\\
250 - Okay.\\
251 - Ooh, this is different, hmm?\\
252 - Candles and music.\\
253 - Do you like it?\\
254 - It's kind of spooky.\\
255 - I can change it back.\\
256 - No, no, no. It's your birthday.\\
257 - As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.\\
258 - (panting)\\
259 - So...\\
260 - What'd you have in mind for tonight?\\
261 - I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner.\\
262 - If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.\\
263 - Um, that sounds nice, but...\\
264 - I'm not really hungry right now.\\
265 - I thought maybe... we could do presents first.\\
266 - Oh.\\
267 - All right.\\
268 - Um...\\
269 - I should probably tell you something about this gift.\\
270 - You mean before you...\\
271 - (suggestively): give it to me?\\
272 - Yes.\\
273 - May I ask you a question before I...\\
274 - (suggestively): give it to you?\\
275 - Of course.\\
276 - Why are we saying “give it to you” like that?\\
277 - Sheldon, I know your present is... for us to be intimate tonight.\\
278 - I see.\\
279 - Is that all right?\\
280 - I'm sorry, but this is a litigious society.\\
281 - I'm gonna need verbal consent.\\
282 - Yes.\\
283 - You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.\\
284 - So, if you don't like Star Wars, why are you here?\\
285 - Oh, I'm just having fun.\\
286 - Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.\\
287 - Like if the movie's bad, it's gonna ruin their lives.\\
288 - Is it bad? Did you hear something?\\
289 - Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.\\
290 - See? That's what I mean.\\
291 - When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn't gonna change at all.\\
292 - He's right.\\
293 - Yeah.\\
294 - No matter what happens, we're coming back tomorrow to watch it again.\\
295 - Do you think Sheldon's actually gonna go through with it?\\
296 - I don't know.\\
297 - He said he's ready.\\
298 - Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he'd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.\\
299 - Well, I'm gonna stay positive.\\
300 - I mean, we talked.\\
301 - I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.\\
302 - Hi.\\
303 - Hello.\\
304 - So, um... should I get under the covers with you?\\
305 - All right.\\
306 - (clears throat)\\
307 - Hello.\\
308 - Hi!\\
309 - Why are you shaking? Are you cold?\\
310 - I'm just, um... really nervous.\\
311 - Why?\\
312 - Well...\\
313 - I've been waiting for this for so long, I've just... built it up in my head.\\
314 - I don't know what to expect.\\
315 - Neither do I.\\
316 - But... we can find out together.\\
317 - Okay.\\
318 - I'm really nervous.\\
319 - I know.\\
320 - We've been waiting so long for this.\\
321 - And we've built it up in our heads so much.\\
322 - Guys, it's just a movie.\\
323 - That's true.\\
324 - He's right. It is.\\
325 - Although, we all remember Jar Jar.\\
326 - Leonard, I-I'm scared again.\\
327 - Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\\
328 - Me, too.\\
329 - I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.\\
330 - That works for me.\\
331 - I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.\\
332 - I don't think I can walk right now.\\
333 - Arthur: Uh, Sheldon?\\
334 - Sheldon.\\
335 - Arthur.\\
336 - What are you doing here?\\
337 - I-I don't think I need any more advice.\\
338 - I-I was just curious.\\
339 - How-How'd it go?\\
340 - Oh.\\
341 - It was amazing.\\
342 - I-I saw it a few days later.\\
343 - What a movie.\\
344 - But, uh, what-what about Amy?\\
345 - Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.\\
346 - But she doesn't have the history with the franchise I do.\\
347 - Okay.\\
348 - Good... good talk.
\subsection {Episode 12: The Sales Call Sublimation}
1 - Sheldon: I'm glad to see you made it safely.\\
2 - How's your hotel?\\
3 - It's not the best Best Western I've been to, but I'd say it's... the third best Best Western I've been to.\\
4 - I know how you feel.\\
5 - The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy.\\
6 - They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn't the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.\\
7 - What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?\\
8 - Mm, that's a great question.\\
9 - I like when they're next to a Chipotle.\\
10 - Okay, well, I should unpack.\\
11 - All right.\\
12 - Enjoy the neurobiology conference.\\
13 - I will.\\
14 - I... wish you were here.\\
15 - At a neurobiology conference?\\
16 - What a mean thing to say.\\
17 - Okay, I'm glad you're not here?\\
18 - Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.\\
19 - Good-bye, Sheldon.\\
20 - Bye.\\
21 - Oh! Good news, gentlemen.\\
22 - Amy's at a conference this weekend, which means I'm available to be entertained, hmm.\\
23 - As today's youth might put it: Who wants to get their Sheld-on?\\
24 - Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel.\\
25 - We could always use an extra pair of hands.\\
26 - That sounds awful. Raj?\\
27 - Uh, I've got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets.\\
28 - You're more than welcome to join me.\\
29 - That's the one to beat.\\
30 - Leonard?\\
31 - Oh, if anything, I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.\\
32 - Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.\\
33 - Well, I should warn you, it's just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.\\

47 - Hey.\\
48 - Hey.\\
49 - Hello.\\
50 - Hi.\\
51 - How was your day?\\
52 - Oh, not good.\\
53 - Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.\\
54 - A doctor?\\
55 - Well, I hope you're not contagious.\\
56 - I've got a weekend in the telescope room I've been excited about for almost three minutes.\\
57 - I'm not sick.\\
58 - It's for work.\\
59 - There's this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps.\\
60 - I've been trying to get in for months.\\
61 - Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?\\
62 - Well, the doctor's a woman, but... yes, because you never know.\\
63 - What kind of doctor is she?\\
64 - Um, a psychiatrist. Why?\\
65 - Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient?\\
66 - Then you'll get to talk to her.\\
67 - Yeah, they already know I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.\\
68 - Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?\\
69 - That's interesting.\\
70 - I'm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.\\
71 - What would I say is wrong with me?\\
72 - Low self-esteem. Social anxiety.\\
73 - Sexual insecurity.\\
74 - None of that is true.\\
75 - Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.\\
76 - That's just crazy.\\
77 - How would my going in there even help you?\\
78 - I don't know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she's heard about the drug.\\
79 - What if I get caught?\\
80 - Fear of failure! Lack of confidence!\\
81 - Kind of a wuss!\\
82 - Fine, I'll do it.\\
83 - But not because of them, because I love you.\\
84 - Thank you.\\
85 - Pushover. Spineless.\\
86 - Still hasn't bought milk even though I told him two days ago!\\
87 - That was incredible.\\
88 - It was.\\
89 - I just wish Stuart wasn't around so we didn't have to be so quiet.\\
90 - I know.\\
91 - It's not like he returns the favor when he watches his Japanese p0rn cartoons.\\
92 - (knocking)\\
93 - Stuart: You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?\\
94 - (mouthing)\\
95 - What is it, Stuart?\\
96 - Stuart: Can I come in?\\
97 - Hang on.\\
98 - (quietly): Should I send him away?\\
99 - No, it's okay.\\
100 - Stuart: Thanks, Bernie.\\
101 - What's up?\\
102 - Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I'd make it easy on you guys and find my own place.\\
103 - Wow. (chuckles)\\
104 - I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.\\
105 - So, when are you thinking of moving?\\
106 - Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.\\
107 - Oh. Okay.\\
108 - Sorry to see you go?\\
109 - Okay, well, thank you guys for everything.\\
110 - I-I really appreciate it.\\
111 - You're very welcome.\\
112 - Hmm.\\
113 - What?\\
114 - Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you're awake.\\
115 - (door closes)\\
116 - What are you doing?\\
117 - Uh, making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.\\
118 - Hmm.\\
119 - What are you doing now?\\
120 - Still making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced.\\
121 - Oh, I see.\\
122 - How about now?\\
123 - Now I'm making sure the telescope's camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a coloring book.\\
124 - Well, I can be helpful.\\
125 - Give me something to do.\\
126 - You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who'd been stealing from the cash register.\\
127 - It was my father.\\
128 - Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.\\
129 - Fine, you want something to do?\\
130 - There's about six months of data on this hard drive.\\
131 - Why don't you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.\\
132 - Yep, I'm on it.\\
133 - Hey, look at that!\\
134 - An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.\\
135 - Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.\\
136 - Found one.\\
137 - No, you didn't.\\
138 - There are millions of data points there.\\
139 - But, look, an optical transient.\\
140 - Yeah, maybe that is something.\\
141 - How did you find that?\\
142 - It wasn't difficult.\\
143 - You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they're twin primes, they're pink and smell like gasoline?\\
144 - No.\\
145 - Oh. I guess I'm a special boy.\\
146 - You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle.\\
147 - Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.\\
148 - Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.\\
149 - Ah, it's my pleasure.\\
150 - I'm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?\\
151 - Uh, she's my mother.\\
152 - You know her?\\
153 - No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.\\
154 - Well, then you know her better than I do.\\
155 - Well, I'm not so sure about that.\\
156 - But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.\\
157 - Really?\\
158 - Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?\\
159 - Well, I didn't want to say it...\\
160 - No, no, say it. Sing it.\\
161 - Rent a plane, write it in the sky.\\
162 - Sounds like you're holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.\\
163 - Oh, no, I-I've worked through a lot of that stuff; I'm better now.\\
164 - Mm. Good for you.\\
165 - Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?\\
166 - That's heartbreaking.\\
167 - Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.\\
168 - You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.\\
169 - Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.\\
170 - Boy, who would've thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I'd still be here two years later?\\
171 - Nobody thought that.\\
172 - No one.\\
173 - Well, that's it.\\
174 - I guess so.\\
175 - This is weird. (chuckles)\\
176 - Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment.\\
177 - Crazy times. See ya!\\
178 - Ignore him.\\
179 - He's just using humor to express how... happy he is.\\
180 - It's okay. I know he loves me.\\
181 - Sure he does.\\
182 - Well, let us know when you're all settled in.\\
183 - I will. And I really can't thank you guys enough.\\
184 - (engine starts)\\
185 - Our pleasure.\\
186 - Bye.\\
187 - Bye.\\
188 - Wolowitz: He's gone!\\
189 - Let's start in the garage!\\
190 - Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.\\
191 - Ooh, perhaps it's a Heliosheath scintillation.\\
192 - It could be a trans-Neptunian object.\\
193 - Maybe it's a new planet.\\
194 - Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.\\
195 - Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I'll be happy.\\
196 - Okay, the final image is coming in.\\
197 - And the object we discovered is...\\
198 - Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.\\
199 - A medium-sized asteroid.\\
200 - That's it?\\
201 - How common.\\
202 - That's the chicken fingers on the menu of space.\\
203 - I kind of like chicken fingers.\\
204 - Yeah, me, too.\\
205 - I was stuck for a metaphor.\\
206 - Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.\\
207 - I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.\\
208 - You dream different than me.\\
209 - It is kind of cute.\\
210 - Yeah, it is.\\
211 - And you know we get to name it.\\
212 - (gasps)\\
213 - We better choose a name no one can make fun of.\\
214 - Sir Frederick William Herschel didn't do Uranus any favors.\\
215 - Hi.\\
216 - Hey, how'd it go?\\
217 - Oh, great.\\
218 - Dr. Gallo is terrific.\\
219 - You know, I-I've always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see...\\
220 - Yeah, no one cares.\\
221 - Did you help me out or not?\\
222 - Okay, n-now, what I'm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I'd be more succinct.\\
223 - You're only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.\\
224 - All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother-- nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life--\\
225 - I told her about you and your drug; she said she'd be happy to meet you.\\
226 - Really?\\
227 - Oh, you're the best husband ever!\\
228 - So you'll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?\\
229 - I guess.\\
230 - Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.\\
231 - (vacuum whirring)\\
232 - Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?\\
233 - No kidding.\\
234 - Oh, okay, I'm about to suck something up.\\
235 - What do you think this object sounds like?\\
236 - Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.\\
237 - So, what do you think we should do with this room?\\
238 - Well, I was thinking a home theater or a gaming room-- you know, like a man cave.\\
239 - Why can't it be a woman cave?\\
240 - As long as it has a home theater, a video game system and you're not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.\\
241 - I'm being serious.\\
242 - Well, what do you think we should do?\\
243 - I don't know, maybe a home office or...\\
244 - Oh.\\
245 - Look.\\
246 - The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.\\
247 - (chuckles): Oh.\\
248 - He was so excited.\\
249 - Yeah.\\
250 - You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.\\
251 - I'll give it to him next time I see him.\\
252 - Have you heard from him since he left?\\
253 - No.\\
254 - You'd think he would've called once he got settled in.\\
255 - Hmm. Maybe he's busy.\\
256 - Too busy to call?\\
257 - He wasn't too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.\\
258 - What is happening?\\
259 - Are we missing him?\\
260 - No, that's not what this feeling is.\\
261 - Is it?\\
262 - Of course not.\\
263 - He drove us crazy.\\
264 - Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries. (scoffs)\\
265 - And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.\\
266 - That was pretty cute. (chuckles)\\
267 - Yeah.\\
268 - Ew, we are missing him!\\
269 - So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.\\
270 - That's a great idea.\\
271 - I've got it.\\
272 - We'll call it... Cooper.\\
273 - How is that both our names?\\
274 - "Koo" from Koothrappali and "per" from Cooper.\\
275 - Yeah, s-so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?\\
276 - Nah, you're right, that's dumb.\\
277 - Hey.\\
278 - Oh, Leonard, great news.\\
279 - We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.\\
280 - Wow, that's amazing!\\
281 - I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.\\
282 - Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.\\
283 - Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.\\
284 - I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.\\
285 - Okay, back to me.\\
286 - I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.\\
287 - Wait, what happened to us?\\
288 - Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.\\
289 - What are you thinking of naming it?\\
290 - I haven't settled on anything yet.\\
291 - We haven't settled on anything yet.\\
292 - All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.\\
293 - You know what'd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.\\
294 - That is a great idea.\\
295 - It's perfect.\\
296 - It appears romantic, but it's really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine's Day forever.\\
297 - So, uh, what were you thinking?\\
298 - Combine their names?\\
299 - I like it.\\
300 - Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy and, uh, the "Y" from Emily.\\
301 - That's just Amy.\\
302 - Exactly.\\
303 - See how well we work together?\\
304 - And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety.\\
305 - Actually, funny story-- the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex; they started taking it, stopped worrying.\\
306 - Got it.\\
307 - Uh, do you have any questions?\\
308 - Just one.\\
309 - Mm-hmm?\\
310 - When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?\\
311 - I just... meant a question about the drug.\\
312 - Yeah, I know what you meant.\\
313 - Let's put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.\\
314 - (whispers): I don't wanna.\\
315 - Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years.\\
316 - Do you think he's perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?\\
317 - You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.\\
318 - That was a big selling point.\\
319 - Hi, Sheldon. What's up?\\
320 - Good news. You're an asteroid.\\
321 - Uh... please tell me what to say next.\\
322 - Perhaps I should explain.\\
323 - While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.\\
324 - (laughs): Oh.\\
325 - Sheldon, thank you.\\
326 - That's so romantic.\\
327 - But what about Rajesh?\\
328 - He was okay with you choosing the name?\\
329 - Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down.\\
330 - Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.\\
331 - All of them?\\
332 - Even the girls.\\
333 - Okay, I think I know what to say now.\\
334 - How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys?\\
335 - I mean, have you ever had s*x with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?\\
336 - I went to college in the '70s; it was a hairier time.\\
337 - I'm gonna say yes.\\
338 - You know, if anything, he's turning me into his mother.\\
339 - Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress.\\
340 - You know, I was pretty good.\\
341 - You know, girl-next-door type, but hot.\\
342 - Doable.\\
343 - Hmm.\\
344 - And not only am I Leonard's mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.\\
345 - Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.\\
346 - I wasn't sure if he was real.\\
347 - Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.\\
348 - Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.\\
349 - I do.\\
350 - You know, Leonard's right.\\
351 - Talking to you is really helping.\\
352 - Oh, I'm glad.\\
353 - You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.\\
354 - Okay, if you think it'll help.\\
355 - Oh, just don't make it Placinex.\\
356 - I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.\\
357 - I miss you.\\
358 - I miss you as well.\\
359 - I can't believe I miss Stuart.\\
360 - I guess I just miss when life was simpler.\\
361 - Girls (chanting): Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\\
362 - Go, Leonard!\\
363 - Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.\\
364 - Girls (chanting): Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!\\
365 - (whispers): I really miss this.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Empathy Optimization}
1 - Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day.\\
2 - How could Batman possibly fight Superman?\\
3 - I mean, isn't that dumb?\\
4 - Maybe he uses Kryptonite.\\
5 - Well, Batman's got a lot of money.\\
6 - Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.\\
7 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
8 - I've seen that movie. It's called Iron Man.\\
9 - (quietly): What is happening?\\
10 - I don't know.\\
11 - But it's beautiful.\\
12 - And now Ben Affleck is Batman?\\
13 - Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.\\
14 - Ooh, we should watch that next girls' night.\\
15 - We could do a double feature with the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet.\\
16 - Oh, I love me some Leo.\\
17 - And it's gone.\\
18 - Oh, hello, everyone.\\
19 - I am happy to report I'm feeling much better.\\
20 - Good for you.\\
21 - (muttering)\\
22 - My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.\\
23 - Glad to hear it.\\
24 - I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.\\
25 - Yay.\\
26 - Well, why isn't everyone happy?\\
27 - Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.\\
28 - You really don't know why?\\
29 - No.\\
30 - But I knew that his “yay” was sarcastic.\\
31 - Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.\\
32 - Let me refresh your memory.\\
33 - Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.\\
34 - Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.\\
35 - I made your bed.\\
36 - I checked your mouth for thrush.\\
37 - You can rub your own chest.\\
38 - Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.\\
39 - I brought you a little care package from work.\\
40 - It's our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.\\
41 - I hope laughter is the best medicine, 'cause this care package is a joke.\\
42 - Hey, she came all the way here...\\
43 - (sneezes)\\
44 - You're gonna want to take these with food.\\
45 - Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.\\
46 - Sheldon: She's a dermatologist.\\
47 - I went to medical school.\\
48 - Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.\\
49 - All right, here you go.\\
50 - Leonard, I'm dying.\\
51 - You're not dying. It's just the flu.\\
52 - I asked for chicken noodle.\\
53 - This is chicken and stars.\\
54 - It's killing me.\\
55 - I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?\\
56 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
57 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
58 -  The Earth began to cool \\
59 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
60 -  We built the Wall \\
61 -  We built the pyramids \\
62 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
63 -  That all started with a big bang \\
64 -  Bang! \\

67 - The Empathy Optimization\\
68 - Original Air Date on January 14, 2016\\
69 - (Skype ringing)\\
70 - Hi, Sheldon.\\
71 - Hello.\\
72 - Are you feeling any better?\\
73 - Physically, yes, but I'm upset because everyone's mad at me for no good reason.\\
74 - Why don't you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I'll explain to you why you're wrong.\\
75 - You know how, when you're sick, you're allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people's feelings don't matter?\\
76 - Ooh. Gentle and loving-- this is gonna be tricky.\\
77 - I had a 101 fever.\\
78 - If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?\\
79 - Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be... unbearable.\\
80 - That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.\\
81 - You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?\\
82 - No, no, not just that.\\
83 - I mean...\\
84 - Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.\\
85 - You know, I'm not the only one who's unpleasant when they're sick.\\
86 - When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.\\
87 - Ooh, I just heard something.\\
88 - Might be hail, might be gunfire.\\
89 - Either way, I'm gonna go take pictures. Bye.\\
90 - Hey, Stuart.\\
91 - Hey. Where's Sheldon?\\
92 - Still sick?\\
93 - Leonard: No, he's fine.\\
94 - We just needed a little break.\\
95 - Yeah, I get that.\\
96 - When I brought him his comics the other day, he said, “Oh, great, Death is literally at my door.”\\
97 - He was being a jerk to everyone.\\
98 - Don't take it personally.\\
99 - Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants, I couldn't if I wanted to.\\
100 - I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.\\
101 - I wish that all the time.\\
102 - Usually before I blow out birthday candles.\\
103 - You know, Amy took some time off from him.\\
104 - Really improved their relationship.\\
105 - Huh. Okay.\\
106 - As long as it doesn't end with us having coitus with him, I'm in.\\
107 - We should all take a trip or something.\\
108 - You know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas.\\
109 - Maybe we should all go.\\
110 - Bernie would love that.\\
111 - Oh! Ooh! Maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.\\
112 - That sounds really fun.\\
113 - Yeah, that sounds fun.\\
114 - A party-bus party don't stop.\\
115 - Ooh! When I say “party,” you say “bus.”\\
116 - No. No.\\
117 - (in rhythm): No. No!\\
118 - So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.\\
119 - Oh, that could be fun.\\
120 - But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?\\
121 - Yes.\\
122 - And Howard's birthday was a drop-off party.\\
123 - You didn't have to stay.\\
124 - Well, I'm in.\\
125 - When are we going?\\
126 - This weekend.\\
127 - Oh, where are we going?\\
128 - Well, Vegas, but...\\
129 - Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy?\\
130 - No, thank you.\\
131 - That's fine, 'cause actually you're not invited.\\
132 - Well, now... well, that's hurtful.\\
133 - Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.\\
134 - I can consider a place America's urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.\\
135 - Not this time.\\
136 - Oh, fine. Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.\\
137 - He's coming, too.\\
138 - Well, then Raj and I will...\\
139 - Nope.\\
140 - Very well. Stuart.\\
141 - Oh, great. Do that.\\
142 - Ugh. Stuart.\\
143 - Hi, Sheldon. What's new?\\
144 - Our friends are jerks, and I'm mad at all of them.\\
145 - I said, “What's new?” but sure.\\
146 - Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?\\
147 - Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?\\
148 - You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.\\
149 - Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.\\
150 - I can't believe you're not on my side.\\
151 - I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.\\
152 - Who else's side could you have been on?\\
153 - I don't know.\\
154 - A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?\\
155 - Sheldon, I understand that you're upset because you feel left out, but I don't know why we're even talking about this.\\
156 - Just apologize to them.\\
157 - Fine, if that's what it takes to go on their dumb trip.\\
158 - Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad.\\
159 - It's called empathy.\\
160 - It's something you could work on.\\
161 - I have empathy.\\
162 - Watch.\\
163 - Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.\\
164 - Great.\\
165 - Now try it as if this isn't your first day as a person.\\
166 - Fine.\\
167 - Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.\\
168 - Hey, I felt a little something.\\
169 - Let me try again.\\
170 - Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.\\
171 - I was mean to him.\\
172 - He must have felt terrible.\\
173 - Oh, now I feel terrible.\\
174 - Neat!\\
175 - Glad I could help.\\
176 - Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.\\
177 - (flatly): I feel so, so bad.\\
178 - Hey, we're both great at this.\\
179 - Leonard, get ready for an apology.\\
180 - And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.\\
181 - Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen, you spoil it in advance.\\
182 - Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that's not on me.\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - Here it comes.\\
185 - You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you.\\
186 - There's no excuse for that.\\
187 - And I'm truly sorry.\\
188 - Thank you.\\
189 - I appreciate that.\\
190 - I want you to know that that is sincere.\\
191 - I-I do feel bad.\\
192 - I'm not just saying it to be included on your trip.\\
193 - Appreciate that, too.\\
194 - Terrific.\\
195 - Now all that's left is for you to invite me to come.\\
196 - Me to ask, “Are you sure?”\\
197 - You to say, “Absolutely.”\\
198 - And then me to bring it home with, “How could I say no to that face?”\\
199 - You're still not coming.\\
200 - What? But I apologized and I meant it.\\
201 - I know that we don't play this game very often, but you're doing it wrong.\\
202 - Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick.\\
203 - I'm not in a position to just say you can come.\\
204 - Well, all right.\\
205 - What if I apologize to all of them?\\
206 - Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it's okay, then yes, you can come.\\
207 - Challenge accepted!\\
208 - Sounds like it's time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.\\
209 - Well, I hope it's as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.\\
210 - (laughing): My goodness!\\
211 - Do you remember “comes with apsparagus”?\\
212 - Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly.\\
213 - I'm sorry.\\
214 - Wow. (chuckles)\\
215 - I'm impressed.\\
216 - No, no, no, wait.\\
217 - I'm not done.\\
218 - Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's “I'm Sorry” played on the pan flute.\\
219 - Apology accepted! Forgiven, forgiven!\\
220 - All right, that's eight hours of practice down the drain.\\
221 - And to memorialize this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.\\
222 - “Sheldon Cooper apologized to me”"\\
223 - “And he made it all better.”\\
224 - (camera clicks)\\
225 - All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.\\
226 - Can this wait?\\
227 - I'm afraid it can't.\\
228 - The trip is tomorrow.\\
229 - And I have more apologies to make.\\
230 - Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out!\\
231 - Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick...?\\
232 - Leonard!\\
233 - You brought me my comic books when I wasn't feeling well.\\
234 - That-that was thoughtful.\\
235 - And I was insensitive.\\
236 - I'm sorry.\\
237 - Thank you, Sheldon.\\
238 - I appreciate that.\\
239 - And I want you to know that I mean it, you know?\\
240 - This isn't me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.\\
241 - What trip to Las Vegas?\\
242 - The one everyone's taking this weekend on the party bus.\\
243 - Of course, I wasn't invited.\\
244 - That would be my understanding.\\
245 - On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?\\
246 - Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.\\
247 - I hope that you can accept my apology.\\
248 - Of course I do.\\
249 - And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors.\\
250 - And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.\\
251 - Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?\\
252 - Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces...\\
253 - Okay!\\
254 - Okay, the point is that we accept your apology.\\
255 - Uh, maybe you do.\\
256 - He just insulted me again.\\
257 - Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.\\
258 - Why are you defending him?\\
259 - (stammers) I believe I can answer that.\\
260 - Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy.\\
261 - Now, why don't you accept my apology, receive your free T-shirt, uh--\\
262 - I hope extra small is okay.\\
263 - For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.\\
264 - Well, I don't accept your apology.\\
265 - What are you doing?\\
266 - It's called standing up for myself.\\
267 - You should try it some time.\\
268 - Fine, how about this?\\
269 - You're making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you'd stop.\\
270 - Oh, you want me to stop?\\
271 - No problem.\\
272 - No, come on, please don't leave!\\
273 - (Sheldon stammers)\\
274 - Point of clarification-- are you still going on the trip?\\
275 - Because if not...\\
276 - Don't worry, you're good.\\
277 - I caused that fight, I feel terrible.\\
278 - (stammers) Wait, I can do that better...\\
279 - I caused that fight.\\
280 - I feel terrible.\\
281 - Yeah, wow, I don't know which one I like more.\\
282 - So, was the fight really bad?\\
283 - (stammers) No.\\
284 - As a fight, it was excellent.\\
285 - She used harsh language and slammed the door.\\
286 - Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.\\
287 - You think they'll still go on the trip?\\
288 - All I know is after the fight I went to Emily's to smooth...\\
289 - They're not going on the trip.\\
290 - No.\\
291 - What is wrong with you?\\
292 - Look at him, caring about what's wrong with me.\\
293 - That is some top-shelf empathy.\\
294 - Hey, well, we should start a club.\\
295 - You went to Emily's to apologize.\\
296 - And when you left, she was crying.\\
297 - That is true.\\
298 - Well, I suppose I should apologize again.\\
299 - (all saying no)\\
300 - Is she okay?\\
301 - Yeah, I calmed her down.\\
302 - But she's not going to Vegas if he's going.\\
303 - Wait, that's an option?\\
304 - I didn't know that was an option.\\
305 - Well, that is fine, because I've decided that I won't be joining you.\\
306 - I've realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.\\
307 - That's very mature of you.\\
308 - Well, I've been on a little trip myself recently.\\
309 - Not to Sin City but to Sincere City.\\
310 - Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you'll come back with is personal growth.\\
311 - And there's your next T-shirt.\\
312 - Ooh, check out the stripper pole.\\
313 - You know what that means.\\
314 - That Raj'll be on it before we make it to the freeway?\\
315 - You know it!\\
316 - (whooping)\\
317 - This is so cool.\\
318 - Let's have champagne!\\
319 - Mm-hmm.\\
320 - Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of...\\
321 - Aha!\\
322 - (all scream)\\
323 - What are you doing?!\\
324 - My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.\\
325 - You couldn't give us just one weekend?\\
326 - I told him this was a bad idea.\\
327 - What do we do-- kick them off?\\
328 - If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them; no questions asked.\\
329 - Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.\\
330 - Oh, God.\\
331 - Emily, as I'm sure you know, I'm considered an odd fellow.\\
332 - But what you don't know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well.\\
333 - I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know?\\
334 - And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.\\
335 - You know, Sheldon...\\
336 - Shh, let him finish.\\
337 - So, for all the times I've offended you and all the times that I'll offend you in the future, I'm sorry.\\
338 - Thank you.\\
339 - Good.\\
340 - Then I'll be leaving now.\\
341 - Oh, it's okay, Sheldon.\\
342 - Come with us.\\
343 - Oh, that's very kind of you.\\
344 - But I'm sure you'll all have a better time without me.\\
345 - Let's go, Stuart.\\
346 - But I want to stay.\\
347 - Stuart, now!\\
348 - You know, I know he's a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.\\
349 - And now you see the problem.\\
350 - Come on, you pain in the ass!\\
351 - That's me!\\
352 - Bye, Stuart.\\
353 - Wait!\\
354 - I'm a pain in the ass, too!\\
355 - Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?\\
356 - At the moment?\\
357 - No, not really.\\
358 -  Burn, baby, burn... \\
359 - Shake it, baby!\\
360 - (whoops)\\
361 - Work that thing!
\subsection {Episode 14: The Meemaw Materialization}
1 - Here's a fun Postal fact.\\
2 - Yeah, the inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction.\\
3 - So, if you broke my right thumb, that's Pasadena city police.\\
4 - But if you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.\\
5 - If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.\\
6 - No.\\
7 - Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw.\\
8 - Umm. Smell this.\\
9 - What is that?\\
10 - Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Schools' foot powder.\\
11 - Yeah, "Grandma", by Calvin Klein.\\
12 - Yeah, the last time I got a hand written letter, it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.\\
13 - That someone has a name.\\
14 - Uh, thank you.\\
15 - Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.\\
16 - Oh, but then she found her old ones.\\
17 - Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.\\
18 - Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.\\
19 - ***\\
20 - Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!\\
21 - Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.\\
22 - Oh, you are going to love her.\\
23 - She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet.\\
24 - Yeah, unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden.\\
25 - In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
27 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
28 -  The Earth began to cool \\
29 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
30 -  We built the Wall \\
31 -  We built the pyramids \\
32 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
33 -  That all started with a big bang \\
34 -  Bang! \\
35 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x14 \\
36 - The Empathy Optimization\\
37 - Original Air Date on February 4, 2016\\
38 - That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her. That's not her.\\
39 - Really?\\
40 - The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?\\
41 - And that's not helpful.\\
42 - You know, I-I got her an iPhone for Christmas.\\
43 - I'll see where she is.\\
44 - Oh, that's nice.\\
45 - Most people her age don't embrace technology.\\
46 - Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it.\\
47 - No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.\\
48 - Same as when we lost you at the zoo.\\
49 - Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.\\
50 - Still doesn't explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.\\
51 - Moon Pie!\\
52 - Meemaw!\\
53 - I'm so happy to see you!\\
54 - I'm happy to see you, too!\\
55 - Oh.\\
56 - You got even smaller.\\
57 - I love it!\\
58 - Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard.\\
59 - Leonard, this is my Meemaw.\\
60 - Hi. So nice to finally meet you.\\
61 - Let me take this for you, Meemaw.\\
62 - Thank you.\\
63 - No. Oh, no. Now you call her “Constance.”\\
64 - I call her “Meemaw.”\\
65 - You have your own Meemaw.\\
66 - It's not my fault she died when you were four.\\
67 - Is that nice to say to your friend?\\
68 - It isn't, Meemaw.\\
69 - Sorry, Leonard.\\
70 - Can you please live with us forever?\\
71 - Oh. (laughs)\\
72 - That's ridiculous! If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?!\\
73 - I'm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?!\\
74 - I'm just saying, instead of “Let it Go,” she should really sing, “Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.”\\
75 - She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day.\\
76 - You know what I saw you do today?\\
77 - Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife!\\
78 - Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song “Let It Go” in place before they finalized the story?\\
79 - Yeah, that's true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.\\
80 - Which is probably why that movie sucks.\\
81 - Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.\\
82 - Miss, I'm so sorry.\\
83 - How can you not like that movie?\\
84 - I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.\\
85 - Oh, that's what I said an hour ago.\\
86 - Wow. You've been talking about Frozen for an hour?\\
87 - You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.\\
88 - It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.\\
89 - Are you comfortable?\\
90 - Very.\\
91 - It's nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.\\
92 - You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.\\
93 - (knocking)\\
94 - (gasps) There's Amy.\\
95 - I just know you're gonna hit it off.\\
96 - You both have the same fashion sense.\\
97 - Hello! Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.\\
98 - Hi. Nice to meet you.\\
99 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
100 - How was your trip?\\
101 - Wonderful.\\
102 - And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.\\
103 - (laughs) That's great.\\
104 - And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot.\\
105 - You know, I don't even get to sit there.\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - And you never will.\\
108 - Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing.\\
109 - Do it, ask her.\\
110 - Can I have a tissue?\\
111 - Of course.\\
112 - (laughs)\\
113 - Isn't that the best?!\\
114 - She's like Grandma Spider-Man.\\
115 - He's been saying that since he was little.\\
116 - I still don't know what it means.\\
117 - Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other.\\
118 - I'll get your room ready.\\
119 - Oh, now don't you go looking through my suitcase for presents.\\
120 - If I did, would I find any?\\
121 - Maybe.\\
122 - But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.\\
123 - That's a risk I'm willing to take!\\
124 - Well, this is so nice.\\
125 - He's so excited to have you here and...\\
126 - Okay, now let's you and me get something straight.\\
127 - He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.\\
128 - S-S...\\
129 - Si-Size me up?\\
130 - Sheldon's mother may be okay with you, but I'm not so easy.\\
131 - Well, I-I'm...\\
132 - I'm sure you'll like me once you get to know me.\\
133 - Oh, you better hope so.\\
134 - A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell!\\
135 - Thank you, Meemaw!\\
136 - Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.\\
137 - Amy, why don't you look excited?\\
138 - Well, you get to watch me play with this!\\
139 - Oh, I see you're reading Saga.\\
140 - Yeah, I hear it's pretty good.\\
141 - It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.\\
142 - I'll take your word for it.\\
143 - You should.\\
144 - He's really looked.\\
145 - I'm Raj, by the way.\\
146 - This is Howard.\\
147 - Hi.\\
148 - Claire.\\
149 - Well, I've seen you here before, Claire.\\
150 - It's my first time.\\
151 - I'm looking for inspiration for this movie I'm writing.\\
152 - You're a screenwriter?\\
153 - Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.\\
154 - Yeah, I get that.\\
155 - I'm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash... guy who probably should have stopped at “scientist.”\\
156 - You're really a scientist?\\
157 - Well, astrophysicist.\\
158 - That's perfect.\\
159 - Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time?\\
160 - It's animated sci-fi for kids.\\
161 - Sure. I love animated movies.\\
162 - He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.\\
163 - Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.\\
164 - Here's my number.\\
165 - Give me a call, we'll get together.\\
166 - Yeah, great.\\
167 - See ya.\\
168 - Yeah, bye.\\
169 - What are you doing?\\
170 - You have a girlfriend.\\
171 - So?\\
172 - So, how do you think she'd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?\\
173 - I wouldn't say she's beautiful.\\
174 - Really? You don't think she's attractive?\\
175 - I do. I just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.\\
176 - Constance, are you sure I can't pour you some wine?\\
177 - Oh, no wine for me.\\
178 - Sheldon's bringing me my whiskey.\\
179 - Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like-- a lot in a glass.\\
180 - Thank you, Moon Pie.\\
181 - Um, curious.\\
182 - Why do you call Sheldon “Moon Pie?”\\
183 - 'Cause he's so nummy-nummy.\\
184 - Both: She could just eat him up.\\
185 - And I call her “Meemaw” because, well, just, well, look at her.\\
186 - It's interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don't.\\
187 - Oh, well, you know, now-now that I'm hearing it, it does sound familiar.\\
188 - How could it?\\
189 - I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.\\
190 - Well, now I know.\\
191 - Yeah.\\
192 - So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.\\
193 - Yes.\\
194 - I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.\\
195 - Oh.\\
196 - It's so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all.\\
197 - A husband and a full-time career.\\
198 - I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.\\
199 - That doesn't bode well.\\
200 - Why not? You-you just said it's okay for her to work.\\
201 - Well, Leonard doesn't need as much tending to as Sheldon does.\\
202 - And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard's work is more of a hobby.\\
203 - That's my best friend.\\
204 - Yeah.\\
205 - Amy: Look, I-I get that you're protective of your grandson, but he's an adult now.\\
206 - Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.\\
207 - I appreciate your honesty, dear.\\
208 - Thank you. And here's some more honesty: I don't like you very much.\\
209 - Well, maybe I don't like you either.\\
210 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Y-You have to like each other.\\
211 - Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebee's.\\
212 - I think I should leave.\\
213 - But why?\\
214 - Other than you two fighting, we're having such a good time.\\
215 - The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time.\\
216 - I don't need this.\\
217 - Let her go.\\
218 - And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.\\
219 - What ring?\\
220 - Maybe we should give them some privacy.\\
221 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
222 - You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.\\
223 - You have an engagement ring?\\
224 - Yes.\\
225 - Penny, did you know about this?\\
226 - All right, let's go.\\
227 - When did you get an engagement ring?\\
228 - My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.\\
229 - Well, thank goodness for that.\\
230 - Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?\\
231 - Oh, I don't think I could do that.\\
232 - Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.\\
233 - (sighs) Y...\\
234 - I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.\\
235 - Who said I even want to be engaged to him?\\
236 - And if I do, I-I don't need your hand-me-downs!\\
237 - All right, all right!\\
238 - Look, l-let's all... let's remain calm and analyze this situation.\\
239 - Now, I realize that you've only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?\\
240 - You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk.\\
241 - Now.\\
242 - Don't speak to him like he's a child.\\
243 - Thank you. I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.\\
244 - Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you're gonna meet up with her.\\
245 - Just to help her with her screenplay.\\
246 - Oh. Well, I guess that's not so bad.\\
247 - You weren't there.\\
248 - He was really flirting.\\
249 - Hey, it's not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.\\
250 - I'm sure it was harmless.\\
251 - People flirt. No big deal.\\
252 - Really? So it's okay if I fl...\\
253 - Not you. I own your ass.\\
254 - The real question is, where are you with Emily?\\
255 - Uh, it's hard to say.\\
256 - I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.\\
257 - I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?\\
258 - No. Never. Absolutely.\\
259 - What?\\
260 - Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.\\
261 - Fine.\\
262 - I had reservations about you, too.\\
263 - No, you didn't.\\
264 - No, I didn't.\\
265 - Well, it doesn't matter now, 'cause I love how things worked out.\\
266 - Me, too.\\
267 - And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.\\
268 - Wow. The last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.\\
269 - Did it?\\
270 - Yeah, right in there.\\
271 - She ate it and everything.\\
272 - (knocking)\\
273 - Sheldon: Leonard and Penny.\\
274 - Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.\\
275 - Come in!\\
276 - Leonard: Hey. What happened?\\
277 - Is Amy gone?\\
278 - No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.\\
279 - Uh-oh.\\
280 - Yeah, I know. It was quite tense.\\
281 - So here's the million dollar question: uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?\\
282 - All right. I've made up my mind.\\
283 - I'm gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I'm in a relationship.\\
284 - Okay, so far we've heard, “made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily.”\\
285 - “Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.”\\
286 - And “made up my mind, I'll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.”\\
287 - I'm calling her.\\
288 - And the threesome didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.\\
289 - You're right.\\
290 - (stifled laughter): It could totally happen.\\
291 - Claire: Hello?\\
292 - Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj.\\
293 - Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.\\
294 - Hey, what's up? Figure out what time you're free?\\
295 - Actually, that's why I'm calling.\\
296 - I, um... I just...\\
297 - I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.\\
298 - Okay. Good for you.\\
299 - Well, no, no.\\
300 - I-I didn't want to mislead you after you asked me out.\\
301 - I didn't ask you out.\\
302 - I just need help with my screenplay.\\
303 - Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?\\
304 - Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.\\
305 - Come on! I just told you I had a girlfriend.\\
306 - The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.\\
307 - Sure, we had a vibe.\\
308 - I knew it.\\
309 - Okay, we did have a vibe.\\
310 - This is exciting.\\
311 - What's my next move?\\
312 - You still have a girlfriend.\\
313 - Right. Good catch.\\
314 - Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time.\\
315 - And, uh... and good luck with your screenplay.\\
316 - Hang on.\\
317 - We're both adults.\\
318 - We can still get together without it meaning anything.\\
319 - Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I've been planning our wedding.\\
320 - Look, it's just coffee.\\
321 - I'll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.\\
322 - Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.\\
323 - Great. I'll text you.\\
324 - Bye.\\
325 - All right.\\
326 - So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults.\\
327 - Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.\\
328 - Are you gonna tell Emily?\\
329 - Yeah, of course.\\
330 - We have no secrets.\\
331 - When are you gonna tell Emily?\\
332 - He lied about the cream cheese!\\
333 - He ate the whole thing! I saw him!\\
334 - Look, I know you think I'm not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot.\\
335 - You have no idea how much I put up with!\\
336 - I know more than you think I do.\\
337 - Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?\\
338 - Young lady, if you think I don't know what it's like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you're wrong.\\
339 - 'Cause that was my husband.\\
340 - Really?\\
341 - (sighs)\\
342 - There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.\\
343 - Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?\\
344 - Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don't want to see that happen again.\\
345 - (door opens)\\
346 - Hi. Sorry.\\
347 - Sheldon would like to say something to you.\\
348 - Sheldon: No, I wouldn't.\\
349 - Just get in here.\\
350 - Hello.\\
351 - Go ahead.\\
352 - Meemaw, look, I'm sorry, but...\\
353 - I have to defend my girlfriend to you.\\
354 - Oh, Sheldon, thank you.\\
355 - Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.\\
356 - I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.\\
357 - I-I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.\\
358 - I did.\\
359 - Yeah, well, that is exactly what I've been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.\\
360 - He never disappoints, does he?\\
361 - I think what Sheldon means to say is we've both grown together.\\
362 - Isn't that right?\\
363 - Well...\\
364 - Say yes.\\
365 - Yes.\\
366 - Meemaw: Fine.\\
367 - If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.\\
368 - Thank you.\\
369 - So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?\\
370 - I suppose.\\
371 - I just gave you my virginity, woman.\\
372 - Cool your jets.\\
373 - Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.\\
374 - This is great.\\
375 - Thank you so much.\\
376 - I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn't too scary for children.\\
377 - And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.\\
378 - Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?\\
379 - I will!

8 - Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.\\
9 - Not a clue. Raj?\\
10 - Spending Valentine's Day with Emily.\\
11 - You don't sound very excited about it.\\
12 - Oh, I am, I am.\\
13 - I g... I guess I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.\\
14 - Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?\\
15 - You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about?\\
16 - Who can say?\\
17 - You've been talking about breaking up with Emily forever.\\
18 - Why don't you just do it already?\\
19 - Yeah, just get it over with.\\
20 - Well, you say it like it's easy.\\
21 - Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?\\
22 - No. Not really.\\
23 - You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident.\\
24 - I just got in and went somewhere.\\
25 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
26 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
27 -  The Earth began to cool \\
28 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\

35 - The Valentino Submergence\\
36 - Original Air Date on February 1\\
37 - So, you really gonna break up with her?\\
38 - Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?\\
39 - Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys.\\
40 - I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?\\
41 - I stopped counting at four.\\
42 - All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.\\
43 - Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there.\\
44 - Really dry myself out.\\
45 - She meant Emily.\\
46 - No, I-I really didn't.\\
47 - You're seriously breaking up with me?\\
48 - Yeah.\\
49 - And you thought right before Valentine's Day was a good time to do it?\\
50 - You're right-- let's talk again in a few days.\\
51 - Hey, Claire.\\
52 - Hi. It's-it's Rajesh.\\
53 - I was-I was wondering if you're free for Valentine's Day?\\
54 - Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.\\
55 - But I just broke up with my girlfriend.\\
56 - Right before Valentine's Day?\\
57 - What an ass.\\
58 - Please take me back.\\
59 - Our love was meant to be!\\
60 - I'm gonna all alone on Valentine's Day.\\
61 - Well, you were right-- tears.\\
62 - Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.\\
63 - I'm nervous.\\
64 - I hope people will be around to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.\\
65 - People who are fans of an Internet show about flags?\\
66 - Trust me, they're around.\\
67 - Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day, I haven't forgotten about you tonight.\\
68 - What do you mean?\\
69 - Well, you've become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.\\
70 - Oh.\\
71 - That is so sweet.\\
72 - So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon' Cooper's Fun With Flags.\\
73 - Catchy.\\
74 - I'm gonna check the temp on the tub.\\
75 - Don't make it too hot.\\
76 - Sorry, but "too hot" is the only temperature I come in.\\
77 - Look at that-- you shaved it all.\\
78 - You're welcome.\\
79 - Um, question-- this is my first hot tub-- is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?\\
80 - Ew, really? Get it out.\\
81 - How?\\
82 - Uh... wish we had a skimmer.\\
83 - Uh, you turn off the jets, I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.\\
84 - I don't know how to turn off the jets.\\
85 - Good, I don't know where we keep the strainer.\\
86 - Excuse me.\\
87 - Uh, bad news.\\
88 - The maître d' said it's gonna be at least an hour.\\
89 - An hour? What? That's crazy.\\
90 - We have a reservation.\\
91 - I know.\\
92 - So what did you say?\\
93 - Thanks, sorry to bother you.\\
94 - But I said it like a badass.\\
95 - All right, well, can't you, like, slip him some money or something?\\
96 - Really? I've never done that before. Does it work?\\
97 - Do people like money-- is that what you're asking?\\
98 - A... a lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.\\
99 - Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national s*x night?\\
100 - I'm sorry.\\
101 - You're pretty, I'm stupid.\\
102 - Hello. Uh, just checked again for Hofstadter.\\
103 - Still gonna be an hour?\\
104 - (clicks tongue) I'm afraid so.\\
105 - Okay. Thanks.\\
106 - Hey.\\
107 - I think you may have dropped this?\\
108 - Oh.\\
109 - Did anybody lose a 20?\\
110 - I did.\\
111 - Oh, I took care of it.\\
112 - We are live in five, four, three...\\

119 - 'Cause you're not getting anything else.\\
120 - Since we're live, you'll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.\\
121 - Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time.\\
122 - Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor.\\
123 - Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.\\
124 - No, I just blink a lot, it's not Morse code for "rescue me."\\
125 - (ringing)\\
126 - Oh, uh, ok...\\
127 - Uh, here's our first call.\\
128 - Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags.\\
129 - What's your question?\\
130 - Koothrappali: What is wrong with me?\\
131 - Why am I so self-destructive?\\
132 - Rajesh?\\
133 - Yes.\\
134 - You two look happy-- how do you do it?\\
135 - I-I think it starts with good communication.\\
136 - Yeah, wait, that's not a flag question. Next caller.\\
137 - I hope you don't think I'm just saying this because it's Valentine's Day, but...\\
138 - I love you so much.\\
139 - I'm gonna put this down your robe.\\
140 - It's not moving, but I think it's still alive.\\
141 - Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?\\
142 - No.\\
143 - No, and it's not a rat, it's a rabbit.\\
144 - We need to save it.\\
145 - Well, how do we do that?\\
146 - Um, I don't know, look it up on your phone.\\
147 - I-I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.\\
148 - Um... "taking care of injured rabbit."\\
149 - Okay.\\
150 - Make sure it's comfortable and warm.\\
151 - Well, it was just in a hot tub.\\
152 - I'm gonna say "check."\\
153 - Anything else?\\
154 - To make sure it's not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution.\\
155 - If it's not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals.\\
156 - Yeah.\\
157 - (sighs) This is ridiculous.\\
158 - You know, I'm gonna go talk to the maître d'.\\
159 - What are you gonna say?\\
160 - I don't know.\\
161 - I'm... I'm gonna flirt with him.\\
162 - I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.\\
163 - I'm still sleeping with you tonight.\\
164 - See if you can get a table by the window.\\
165 - Hi there.\\
166 - What's your name?\\
167 - Glen.\\
168 - Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?\\
169 - Well, you know, Valentine's Day.\\
170 - Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight.\\
171 - Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just...\\
172 - With all due respect, ma'am, there's nothing I can do.\\
173 - (chuckles) You don't have to call me ma'am.\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - I mean, we're basically the same age.\\
176 - (laughs): Okay.\\
177 - How old are you?\\
178 - I'm 21. How old are you?\\
179 - Just shut up, Glen.\\
180 - Come on, let's get out of here.\\
181 - What? Why?\\
182 - Because I'm young. Let's go.\\
183 - Rajesh, it's perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.\\
184 - Well, you really think so?\\
185 - Yeah, you know what's not normal?\\
186 - Blubbering about emotions during a flag show.\\
187 - Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag.\\
188 - Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we're rooting for you.\\
189 - Your friend is hurting.\\
190 - No, Sheldon's right.\\
191 - Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.\\
192 - I-I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship.\\
193 - Uh, perhaps even a-a red flag.\\
194 - And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union.\\
195 - Hubba, hubba.\\
196 - (phone ringing)\\
197 - Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller.\\
198 - Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.\\
199 - Kripke: Hello. I want to talk about how lonely I am, too.\\
200 - Kripke? Is that you?\\
201 - Yeah, I'm just sitting here all by myself wondering if I'll ever find someone to share my life with.\\
202 - Preferably Asian, 18-24, no fatties.\\
203 - Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.\\
204 - All right. Is my pole flag-related?\\
205 - I don't see why not.\\
206 - He's eating. That's a good sign.\\
207 - You're gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.\\
208 - (laughs)\\
209 - He's pretty cute.\\
210 - He is.\\
211 - Should we... name him?\\
212 - It is Valentine's Day.\\
213 - How about Valentino?\\
214 - Nice. A classic rabbit name.\\
215 - (both laugh)\\
216 - Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit.\\
217 - Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.\\
218 - Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite.\\
219 - Of course you're a Wolowitz.\\
220 - (both laugh)\\
221 - Son of a bitch! He bit me!\\
222 - Are you okay?\\
223 - No, I'm not okay!\\
224 - Wild rabbits can have rabies!\\
225 - Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?\\
226 - Poor judgment, obviously.\\
227 - He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.\\
228 - How can it be fine?\\
229 - I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.\\
230 - It's not what we planned, but this isn't so bad, right?\\
231 - It is freaking amazing.\\
232 - Well, glad you're feeling better.\\
233 - I was just hungry and cranky, and I've never been called "ma'am" before.\\
234 - Is that a big deal?\\
235 - Kind of. When was the first time someone called you "sir"?\\
236 - Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so...\\
237 - Can you believe when I met you I was 22?\\
238 - (laughs) I mean, it's crazy!\\
239 - Where did all that time go?\\
240 - Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.\\
241 - Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.\\
242 - No, they're not.\\
243 - You're closer to 40 than you are 30.\\
244 - Ha, ha! You married an old man.\\
245 - Tell you what.\\
246 - Let's do something fun tonight.\\
247 - Won't make us any younger.\\
248 - Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we'll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.\\
249 - Okay, like what?\\
250 - I know. Food fight!\\
251 - I'll keep thinking.\\
252 - Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.\\
253 - Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.\\
254 - But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn't you start dating someone right away?\\
255 - Well, I... I wouldn't say right away.\\
256 - And actually, it was three different men.\\
257 - Kripke: Three different men?!\\
258 - Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?\\
259 - Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\\
260 - Actually, I'm still here.\\
261 - Now?\\
262 - Yup.\\
263 - Now?\\
264 - Yup!\\
265 - Now?\\
266 - Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.\\
267 - Before Emily, I was alone for so long.\\
268 - I just... I don't know if I can do that again.\\
269 - Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up.\\
270 - The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so... you think you got problems.\\
271 - I have an idea.\\
272 - Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh.\\
273 - Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent...\\
274 - Koothrappali: Rich parents! Don't forget, rich parents!\\
275 - ...spoiled astrophysicist who not only...\\
276 - (phone ringing)\\
277 - Oh. Well, that was quick.\\
278 - Hi. You're on Fun with Flags.\\
279 - Kripke: Hey, I think I got cut off.\\
280 - Hello, Kripke.\\
281 - I have a flag question.\\
282 - How many men did you have s*x with?\\
283 - Let's see. What's young and fun?\\
284 - Uh, we could go dancing.\\
285 - Are you actually gonna dance?\\
286 - Of course.\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - No one wants to see that.\\
289 - Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?\\
290 - No, I don't need any fish nibbling my business.\\
291 - Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge!\\
292 - I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.\\
293 - That sounds fun.\\
294 - When's it start?\\
295 - Midnight.\\
296 - Midnight. Really?\\
297 - You know what? Let's do it.\\
298 - Okay, great!\\
299 - Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.\\
300 - Oh, thank God.\\
301 - Yes!\\
302 - It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.\\
303 - Oh, terrific.\\
304 - It's not terrific.\\
305 - Lots of highly unlikely things happen.\\
306 - You saw what's under this robe, and you still married me.\\
307 - If you're really worried, we'll take him to the vet and have him tested.\\
308 - Good.\\
309 - Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test!\\
310 - All they have to do is... cut off his head and check his brain.\\
311 - Oh, cut off his head?\\
312 - That's where his little nose is.\\
313 - He's not showing any symptoms.\\
314 - I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.\\
315 - Howie, this is just your hypochondria.\\
316 - No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.\\
317 - We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.\\
318 - Koothrappali: I mean, this is the first time I've ever broken up with someone.\\
319 - I just... I didn't realize it was gonna hurt this much.\\
320 - It really can.\\
321 - All right.\\
322 - Nothing about this is fun.\\
323 - No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven't spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet.\\
324 - Dr. Amy Farrah Flower Present... With.\\
325 - Koothrappali: I'm sorry for bothering you.\\
326 - I'll hang up now.\\
327 - No, hold on, Rajesh.\\
328 - You know, you're not being very sympathetic.\\
329 - You know firsthand that breakups are hard.\\
330 - Fine.\\
331 - If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be.\\
332 - However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.\\
333 - It provides information from the environment that, uh, behavior isn't good for us.\\
334 - Kripke: Like when I fell in love with that stripper and bought her a Prius.\\
335 - I'm just gonna push all the buttons.\\
336 - Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering.\\
337 - When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered.\\
338 - And this may sound surprising, but I'm grateful for having gone through it.\\
339 - Really?\\
340 - Yes.\\
341 - I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.\\
342 - So do I.\\
343 - When-when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me.\\
344 - And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they...\\
345 - Both: Happy Valentine's Day!\\
346 - (whooping)\\
347 - We are young and fun!\\
348 - (horn honking)\\
349 - I stand corrected.\\
350 - Fun.\\
351 - Congratulations on a successful live show.\\
352 - And a lovely Valentine's Day.\\
353 - Cleaning up is not young and fun.\\
354 - It can be.\\
355 - Confetti fight!\\
356 - Maybe you should take a break.\\
357 - I got this.\\
358 - Did you know the singular of confetti is "confetto"?\\
359 - Interesting, and when would you use the singular?\\
360 - I'm glad you asked.\\
361 - Amy, you have a confetto in your nose.\\
362 - No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.

5 - Son of a bitch, he bit me.\\
6 - Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.\\

10 - Morning.\\
11 - Morning.\\
12 - "We"?\\
13 - What is this?\\
14 - I don't know.\\
15 - Maybe it says something on the back.\\
16 - "Continued on milk."\\
17 - If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.\\
18 - "Are."\\
19 - "We are..."\\

21 - What could it be?\\
22 - "We are Groot"?\\

25 - "I got all my sisters with me."\\
26 - Are you serious?\\
27 - Yeah.\\
28 - Are you sure?\\
29 - Pretty positive.\\
30 - That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...\\
31 - Oh, my God.\\
32 - This is incredible.\\
33 - We're gonna be parents?\\
34 - We're gonna get to board planes first.\\
35 - Finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.\\
36 - I know, it's crazy.\\
37 - It is crazy.\\
38 - Oh.\\
39 - I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?\\
40 - I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.\\
41 - Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.\\
42 - But how's this all gonna work?\\
43 - Do we get a nanny?\\
44 - I mean, can we afford a nanny?\\
45 - And if we can, we can't get a pretty one, 'cause it'll wreck our marriage.\\
46 - We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.\\
47 - I-I don't know, Howie.\\
48 - Are we in a good school district?\\
49 - You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.\\
50 - What religion do we raise it?\\
51 - And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?\\
52 - People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.\\
53 - Calm down, it's gonna be okay.\\
54 - How's it gonna be okay?\\
55 - Look at me, I'm a mess.\\
56 - And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.\\

71 - Oh, I heard about that.\\
72 - Why didn't you discover it?\\
73 - Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.\\

81 - If it's "thank you" for the homemade jam you got in December, congratulations, you're the first one.\\
82 - What's going on?\\
83 - I'm, uh... uh, gonna be a father.\\
84 - That's so amazing.\\
85 - What? Congratulations.\\
86 - Oh, no.\\
87 - Why "oh, no"?\\
88 - Because this changes everything.\\
89 - What about comic book night?\\
90 - Uh, what about playing games together?\\
91 - What about our trips to Disneyland?\\
92 - How can we do those things with a child around?\\
93 - Relax, there's room for two babies in this group.\\
94 - Oh, dear L...\\
95 - Penny's pregnant, too?\\
96 - You're the other baby.\\
97 - Oh, really?\\
98 - Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?\\
99 - Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?\\
100 - I guess we'll call this a draw.\\
101 - So, I'm glad you guys are here.\\
102 - There's something I want to share with you.\\
103 - Howie and I are going to...\\
104 - Leonard says you're pregnant.\\
105 - What?\\
106 - "Don't say anything.\\
107 - Act surprised when she tells you."\\
108 - All right, how you want to do this?\\
109 - I'm pregnant.\\
110 - Oh, my God, I can't believe it!\\
111 - This is so exciting!\\
112 - Yeah, it's all real exciting.\\
113 - Are-are you not happy about this?\\
114 - I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...\\
115 - I'm sure it's just the hormones.\\
116 - But it's weird-- Howie's the one who's been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I'm gonna get fat.\\
117 - No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat.\\
118 - You're gonna be beautiful and glowing and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.\\
119 - Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.\\
120 - Sorry, hormones.\\
121 - Oh, that's all right. All I heard was "skinny."\\
122 - I wouldn't make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.\\
123 - Yeah, I'm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.\\
124 - You're probably right.\\
125 - After we talked about it, he started to calm down.\\
126 - I shouldn't be raising a kid.\\
127 - I don't even eat my own vegetables.\\
128 - Buddy, I-I think you might be overreacting.\\
129 - And then there's this nose.\\
130 - I mean, what if he looks like me?\\
131 - Or worse... what if she looks like me?\\
132 - Not to mention the impact on our social circle.\\
133 - Everything's going to change.\\
134 - Howard won't be able to come over as much.\\
135 - Well, he could bring the baby here.\\
136 - Oh, but then we'd have to baby-proof the apartment.\\
137 - You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.\\
138 - I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.\\
139 - Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?\\
140 - I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.\\
141 - A million dollars?\\
142 - God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.\\
143 - That's it-- I got to start earning more money right now.\\
144 - I know-- you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.\\
145 - This isn't a joke.\\
146 - I wasn't joking.\\
147 - It'll be fine.\\
148 - People have kids every day.\\
149 - You'll figure this out.\\
150 - Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.\\
151 - Oh... You're right, it is, I'm just... a little overwhelmed right now.\\
152 - Hey, you know what we should do?\\
153 - All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?\\
154 - Go out and celebrate.\\
155 - But not your worst idea.\\
156 - Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.\\
157 - Yeah, yeah, we should go out.\\
158 - Where?\\
159 - Uh, I don't know, a bar?\\
160 - Can't drink.\\
161 - We can, but all right.\\
162 - Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?\\
163 - Doctor said I can't have sushi.\\
164 - Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.\\
165 - We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.\\
166 - Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.\\
167 - Maybe you should get a new doctor.\\
168 - What, he said you can't laugh either?\\
169 - I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard-- his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...\\
170 - And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.\\
171 - Cheers.\\
172 - Well, look at this.\\
173 - I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn't have to worry about money.\\
174 - He can have all the kids he wants.\\
175 - And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.\\
176 - If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.\\
177 - There's no reason you can't.\\
178 - That's easy for you to say.\\
179 - You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.\\
180 - That's just research. We're never gonna make any money from it.\\
181 - Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.\\
182 - Reminds me of my daddy's secret "Don't Tell Mama" juice.\\
183 - Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.\\
184 - Oh. I'll just take one last sip.\\
185 - Ah.\\
186 - Okay, how about this for an invention-- slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.\\
187 - How is that a new invention?\\
188 - I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.\\
189 - It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.\\
190 - This place is terrific.\\
191 - Why-why have we never been here before?\\
192 - The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff-- you.\\
193 - That's some smart talk from a guy who can't even keep his face in focus.\\
194 - Where's the bathroom?\\
195 - Uh, it's in the corner.\\
196 - Excuse me.\\
197 - Hey, how you doin'?\\
198 - I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.\\
199 - Doesn't matter.\\
200 - He's headed for the kitchen anyway.\\
201 - Maybe that's an idea-- guidance systems for drunk people.\\
202 - They have that. It's called Uber.\\
203 - Hey.\\
204 - In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?\\
205 - Yeah. Why?\\
206 - Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?\\
207 - Wow. I've never thought about that.\\
208 - And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.\\
209 - Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.\\
210 - Tell me this isn't like the best episode of s*x and the City.\\
211 - You may have actually just come up with something.\\
212 - You think so?\\
213 - I really do.\\
214 - You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.\\
215 - There's people cooking in it.\\
216 - Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.\\
217 - Yeah!\\
218 - Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.\\
219 - I kind of already do that for Howie.\\
220 - And-and whenever you're hungry, you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.\\
221 - Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.\\
222 - It only lets out three at a time.\\
223 - So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?\\
224 - Well, we didn't exactly decide.\\
225 - We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.\\
226 - Oh, tell us!\\
227 - Yeah, tell us.\\
228 - No, I'm embarrassed.\\
229 - Oh, come on, we're all grown-ups. We've all done it.\\
230 - Me! Me-me, too! I'm a grown-up and I've done it!\\
231 - Fine.\\
232 - We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.\\
233 - Oh, that sounds juicy.\\
234 - Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out...\\
235 - Wait, I remember that.\\
236 - Hang on.\\
237 - You did it at our place?\\
238 - Kind of on Sheldon's bed.\\
239 - What?! No!\\
240 - I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out.\\
241 - Usually he says, "Do not go in there," but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."\\
242 - How could you do that?\\
243 - I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.\\
244 - I do know what that's like. I really do.\\
245 - I'm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.\\
246 - I'm not finding anything either.\\
247 - That's a good sign.\\
248 - Oh, wait, I found something.\\
249 - Damn. What is it?\\
250 - This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.\\
251 - Can you focus on what we're talking about?\\
252 - All right.\\
253 - Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.\\
254 - Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.\\
255 - And stronger.\\
256 - Yeah. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?\\
257 - I'd enjoy that.\\
258 - Nah, she's a good kid.\\
259 - If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.\\
260 - Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father for less than a day and you're already stepping up.\\
261 - I'm telling you, you got this.\\
262 - Maybe you're right.\\
263 - Of course he's right.\\
264 - You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.\\
265 - That's why I'm confident you're gonna be the best dad you can be.\\
266 - Thank you, Sheldon.\\
267 - You're welcome.\\
268 - And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.\\
269 - You guys can go in if you want.\\
270 - No, we're a team.\\
271 - If you can't go in, we're not going in.\\
272 - Then why are we drinking?\\
273 - Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there, all right?\\
274 - Oh. It's Leonard.\\
275 - He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.\\
276 - That sounds fun.\\
277 - Oh, no.\\
278 - Sheldon's drunk texting me.\\
279 - What's it say?\\
280 - "Would you like to sing karaoke with us."\\
281 - How is that a drunk text?\\
282 - He used a period instead of a question mark.\\
283 - He's so wasted.\\
284 -  Your movie's showing, so you're going \\
285 -  Could care less about the five you're blowing \\
286 -  Theater gets dark just to start the show \\
287 -  You spot a fine woman sitting \\
288 -  In your row, she's dressed in yellow \\
289 -  She says, "Hello" \\
290 -  "Come sit next to me, you fine fellow" \\
291 -  You run over there without a second to lose \\
292 -  And what comes next, hey \\
293 -  Bust a move \\
294 -  You want it \\
295 -  You got it, oh, you want it \\
296 -  Baby, you got it \\
297 -  Just bust a move \\
298 -  You want it \\
299 -  You got it, oh \\
300 -  You want it, baby, you got it \\
301 -  Just bust a move \\
302 -  You want it, you got it \\
303 -  Oh, you want it \\
304 - Hey, guys. Congratulations!\\
305 - Thank you.\\
306 - Hi. How are you doing?\\
307 - Oh, wonderful.\\
308 - I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move.\\
309 - If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.\\
310 - I'm really glad you're here.\\
311 - Can we talk?\\
312 - Sure.\\
313 - So, you gonna get up there later?\\
314 - A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.\\
315 - I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.\\
316 - I want you to know...\\
317 - I'm done being scared.\\
318 - It's okay to be nervous. I am, too.\\
319 - Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants.\\
320 - But I'm also really excited.\\
321 - I mean it.\\
322 - Me, too.\\
323 - I love you.\\
324 - Mmm.\\
325 - And I'm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.\\
326 -  Are we an item? Girl, quit playin' \\
327 -  We're just friends \\
328 -  What are you sayin'? \\
329 -  Say there's another and look right in my eyes \\
330 -  My first love broke my heart for the first time \\
331 -  And I was like \\
332 -  Baby, baby, baby, ooh \\
333 -  Like, baby, baby, baby, no \\
334 -  Like, baby, baby, baby, ooh \\
335 -  I thought you'd always be mine \\
336 -  Baby, I need your lovin', got \\
337 -  To have all your lovin' \\
338 -  Baby, I need your lovin' \\
339 -  Got to have all your lovin' \\
340 -  \\
341 -  Ooh, baby, baby \\
342 -  Baby, baby \\
343 -  Ooh, baby, baby \\
344 -  Baby, baby \\
345 -  Ah, push it \\
346 - I appreciate this, but you really...\\
347 -  Push it real good \\
348 -  Land where my fathers died \\
349 -  Land of the pilgrims' pride \\
350 -  From ev'ry mountainside \\
351 -  Let freedom \\
352 -  Ring... \\
353 - I'd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and... now the mother of our child.\\
354 - I love you, Bernie.\\
355 -  \\
356 -  Havin' my baby \\
357 -  What a lovely way of sayin' \\
358 -  How much you love me \\
359 -  Havin' my baby \\
360 -  What a lovely way \\
361 -  Of sayin' what you're thinkin' of me \\
362 - You're kidding!\\
363 - What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom?!\\
364 -  \\
365 - Thank you, Pasadena! Good night!\\
366 - That was such a fun night.\\
367 - Probably 'cause you got to see your man up there rockin' the mic.\\
368 - Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.\\
369 - Oh. That was really an asthma attack.\\
370 - I just sold it.\\
371 - Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.\\
372 - Me, too.\\
373 - So, you ever think about it?\\
374 - Babies? Mm-hmm.\\
375 - Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.\\
376 - What about you?\\
377 - I think we'd make amazing parents.\\
378 - Will you guys keep it down?\\
379 - On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Celebration Experimentation}
1 - So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.\\
2 - Way to narrow it down to everything.\\
3 - What is it?\\
4 - Well, your birthday's coming up.\\
5 - And you've never let us celebrate it.\\
6 - And I was hoping maybe this year we could.\\
7 - Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have.\\
8 - Okay, great, I mean, it doesn't have to be a big party or anything.\\
9 - I was just...\\
10 - Where'd he go?\\
11 - W-Wait a minute.\\
12 - You mention his birthday and he vanishes?\\
13 - Well, where's that information been this whole time?\\
14 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
15 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
16 -  The Earth began to cool \\
17 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
18 -  We built the Wall \\
19 -  We built the pyramids \\
20 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
21 -  That all started with a big bang \\
22 -  Bang! \\
23 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x17 \\
24 - The Celebration Experimentation\\
25 - Original Air Date on February 25, 2016\\
26 - Well, where is he?\\
27 - Sheldon?\\
28 - I'll check his room.\\
29 - Surprise!\\
30 - (both scream)\\
31 - Oh, my God!\\
32 - Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible.\\
33 - Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one?\\
34 - Yeah, I suggest “how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew?”\\
35 - You know, the answer, it may surprise you.\\
36 - I'm sorry I brought it up.\\
37 - Yeah, what is the problem?\\
38 - Is it about getting older?\\
39 - Please, look at this porcelain skin.\\
40 - I'm like a human sink.\\
41 - But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.\\
42 - One day. (laughs)\\
43 - Right.\\
44 - Can you please just tell me why?\\
45 - Fine.\\
46 - As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday.\\
47 - Every year we'd have a party.\\
48 - No one I invited would ever come, because they didn't like me.\\
49 - I'm sorry.\\
50 - Oh, that part wasn't so bad.\\
51 - I didn't like them, either.\\
52 - But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister's friends.\\
53 - Oh, you poor thing.\\
54 - When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party.\\
55 - I waited by the door for hours.\\
56 - Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.\\
57 - You realize none of those things would happen now?\\
58 - I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?\\
59 - Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favor.\\
60 - Penny: Yeah, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.\\
61 - And we live here, so we have no choice.\\
62 - Yeah.\\
63 - Very well.\\
64 - You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love.\\
65 - But then you owe me big-time.\\
66 - You have any idea what you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?\\
67 - He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately.\\
68 - Maybe we could get him a fossil.\\
69 - Well, just don't get anything Jurassic.\\
70 - He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood.\\
71 - Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.\\
72 - That's funny.\\
73 - Let's do that.\\
74 - Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.\\
75 - You mean, some guy in a lame suit?\\
76 - Or a real Batman.\\
77 - Hey, Stuart?\\
78 - Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?\\
79 - Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict.\\
80 - He, uh, wanted to know when he'd get paid.\\
81 - And I wouldn't tell him.\\
82 - Can I get his contact info?\\
83 - Sure, uh, but just so you know, he's kind of a diva.\\
84 - He is?\\
85 - Oh, yeah.\\
86 - Won't take the bus.\\
87 - He won't pack his own lunch.\\
88 - Won't let you spend the night on his couch.\\
89 - Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?\\
90 - Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.\\
91 - Latex balloons, no.\\
92 - Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.\\
93 - All right, what about music?\\
94 - I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.\\
95 - No music it is.\\
96 - What kind of cake do you like?\\
97 - Well, my favorite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there's writing on it, make sure it's not all caps.\\
98 - I don't need my dessert yelling at me.\\
99 - Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?\\
100 - Uh, nice guy.\\
101 - But it was a little weird to hear Batman say, “Don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.”\\
102 - You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman?\\
103 - Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.\\
104 - Don't say that to him.\\
105 - What? He beat out George Clooney.\\
106 - And that's something.\\
107 - Like, I love me some Clooney.\\
108 - Don't say that to anyone.\\
109 - Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.\\
110 - Oh, I-I was just glad to be invited.\\
111 - To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm part of the group.\\
112 - Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.\\
113 - Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?\\
114 - (door opens)\\
115 - Hello, I hope I'm not too early.\\
116 - No, no, no. Come on in.\\
117 - And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?\\
118 - Doing great.\\
119 - Y-You're pregnant?\\
120 - Yeah.\\
121 - Sounds like something a member of the group might know.\\
122 - Yeah, birthday party first.\\
123 - Pity party later.\\
124 - Are you crazy?\\
125 - How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?\\
126 - Oh, please.\\
127 - Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.\\
128 - Thank you!\\
129 - That's why I say Keaton's number one.\\
130 - He brought a sense of humor to the role.\\
131 - Oh, if you're gonna factor in a sense of humor, then I should be at the top of the list.\\
132 - It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.\\
133 - Really?\\
134 - You're ahead of Bale?\\
135 - The man who personified the words, (deep voice): “I'm Batman.”\\
136 - I never had to say I'm Batman.\\
137 - I showed up.\\
138 - People knew I was Batman.\\
139 - Everywhere I went-- on the TV show, mall openings...\\
140 - Julie Newmar's bungalow.\\
141 - I'm sold-- you're ahead of Bale.\\
142 - There's another reason I should be higher on the list.\\
143 - All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes.\\
144 - All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.\\
145 - Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?\\
146 - Sure. Yeah, of course.\\
147 - What's an Affleck?\\
148 - Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?\\
149 - Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.\\
150 - But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?\\
151 - Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech, and that's when you just tear 'em a new one.\\
152 - Have to say, you... you do look good in that suit.\\
153 - Oh. Thank you.\\
154 - Maybe later I'll, uh... get to see you in your birthday suit.\\
155 - But this is my birthday suit.\\
156 - Are you having a stroke?\\
157 - Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.\\
158 - So, Mother, I'm surprised you came all this way for Sheldon's birthday.\\
159 - Oh, I was happy to.\\
160 - He did come to my 60th.\\
161 - Oh. You had a party for your 60th?\\
162 - Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.\\
163 - Just a few close friends.\\
164 - And your sister and brother.\\
165 - You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn't invite her.\\
166 - And I never did thank you for that, dear.\\
167 - (ringtone plays)\\
168 - Amy: Oh.\\
169 - Penny says everyone's there.\\
170 - Are you ready?\\
171 - (takes deep breath) I am.\\
172 - Oh. Wait.\\
173 - Are you all right?\\
174 - No, I just... I got a little light-headed.\\
175 - Oh, d-do you need a minute?\\
176 - (exhales) No.\\
177 - No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.\\
178 - Others: Happy birthday!\\
179 - (whooping, clapping)\\
180 - Speech! Speech!\\
181 - Come on, Sheldon, say something.\\
182 - Uh, um... uh, thank you all so much for coming.\\
183 - Uh, Beverly.\\
184 - Wil Wheaton.\\
185 - Adam West, for some reason.\\
186 - Batman finally came to your party.\\
187 - Happy birthday, Sherman.\\
188 - Sheldon: Thank you.\\
189 - This is all so thoughtful.\\
190 - (heartbeat thumping loudly)\\
191 - (panting): Excuse me.\\
192 - I still get paid, don't I?\\
193 - Okay, I'd better go in there and talk to him.\\
194 - Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?\\
195 - No offense, but I've known the guy a really long time.\\
196 - Well, I've, you know, seen him without pants on.\\
197 - Again, no offense, but so have I.\\
198 - Well, he's seen me without pants on.\\
199 - Again, no...\\
200 - Okay, this is ridiculous.\\
201 - (knocking)\\
202 - Sheldon?\\
203 - Can I come in?\\
204 - (sighs)\\
205 - How do you know I'm not using the facilities?\\
206 - Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I've clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times.\\
207 - So... what's going on?\\
208 - I don't know.\\
209 - I-I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it... it was just too much.\\
210 - I get that.\\
211 - Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here?\\
212 - You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet.\\
213 - It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.\\
214 - I know that you worked hard to put this together.\\
215 - I'm sorry I'm ruining it.\\
216 - Oh, pl... You're not ruining it.\\
217 - Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide.\\
218 - Now, that will ruin it.\\
219 - I don't think I can go back out there.\\
220 - That's fine.\\
221 - You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you.\\
222 - But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.\\
223 - Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.\\
224 - (scoffs) My point is, there was a time I never would've been friends with someone like you, and now... you are one of my favorite people.\\
225 - So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I'm happy to do it with you.\\
226 - Well, everyone will think I'm weird.\\
227 - Sweetie, you are weird.\\
228 - Everyone knows you're weird, but they're all still here because they care about you so much.\\
229 - (knocking)\\
230 - Kripke: Hello.\\
231 - Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Leonard's mother.\\
232 - Leonard.\\
233 - Hey.\\
234 - It's been a while.\\
235 - Leslie.\\
236 - I can't remember the last time we talked.\\
237 - So much has changed.\\
238 - Has it?\\
239 - Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.\\
240 - Wow, congratulations.\\
241 - You know, actually, I thought you'd be living with Sheldon forever.\\
242 - Yeah, well...\\
243 - Don't be a stranger.\\
244 - Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he's a little embarrassed, so let's all be extra nice, okay?\\
245 - What are you looking at me for?\\
246 - I'm a saint. (chuckles)\\
247 - But a sinner in the sack.\\
248 - Hello, everyone.\\
249 - I-I...\\
250 - I'd like to apologize for my behavior.\\
251 - I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party.\\
252 - So, just, please, enjoy yourselves.\\
253 - That's good.\\
254 - (party chatter resumes)\\
255 - Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.\\
256 - If I may, I-I'd like to propose a toast.\\
257 - Um, thank you all for coming tonight.\\
258 - I know it's customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.\\
259 - All: Aw.\\
260 - Hear, hear.\\
261 - Koothrappali: Cheers.\\
262 - Amy, that was lovely.\\
263 - You know, this is fun.\\
264 - Let's do more.\\
265 - Someone else say something wonderful about me.\\
266 - Sheldon, I don't think everyone...\\
267 - Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.\\
268 - Okay, then, uh, (clears throat)\\
269 - Sheldon, (chuckles) we've known each other a long time.\\
270 - And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.\\
271 - Little generic. Keep thinking. We'll circle back.\\
272 - Wil Wheaton, go.\\
273 - Sheldon, I know that we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it.\\
274 - We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek.\\
275 - But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper.\\
276 - Live long and prosper, buddy.\\
277 - And happy birthday.\\
278 - All: Cheers.\\
279 - That's how you do it, Wolowitz.\\
280 - Now you see why he's famous and you're not.\\
281 - Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can't wait to see what they are.\\
282 - Happy birthday, dear.\\
283 - All: Cheers.\\
284 - Someone call Animal Control.\\
285 - There's a cougar on the loose.\\
286 - Barry, stop.\\
287 - Seriously, Barry, stop.\\
288 - And it was Gandhi who said, “Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.”\\
289 - And it was Sheldon Cooper who said “Let's speed this up.\\
290 - A lot of people want to talk”"\\
291 - Uh, in the past, I would've said something obnoxious, like, “Happy birthday, dumbass”.\\
292 - But I'm not gonna do it.\\
293 - You and I have both grown a lot, and it's just so nice to see you all again.\\
294 - So... happy birthday, Sheldon.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - Oh, now, you know I hate change.\\
297 - Say it.\\
298 - Happy birthday, dumbass!\\
299 - (cheering)\\
300 - Happy birthday, young man.\\
301 - And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I'm also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs...\\
302 - I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said.\\
303 - So, here's to you, Sheldon.\\
304 - Hear, hear. Hear, hear.\\
305 - Thank you, Bernadette.\\
306 - That was perfect.\\
307 - What? You gotta be kidding me?\\
308 - Sheldon, we've been together so long, it's hard to remember a time you weren't in my life.\\
309 - And believe me, I try.\\
310 - (laughter)\\
311 - You make me laugh.\\
312 - You make me a better scientist.\\
313 - You make me crazy.\\
314 - You're more than just my roommate, you're my brother.\\
315 - Thank you.\\
316 - Happy birthday, buddy.\\
317 - All: Cheers.\\
318 - Thank you. That-that was wonderful.\\
319 - Penny: Oh, wait, wait, wait.\\
320 - Stuart didn't get to speak.\\
321 - Oh, oh, okay. Um...\\
322 - Uh, Sheldon, I've spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone...\\
323 - Hey, everybody, listen up.\\
324 - You nailed it.\\
325 - We've got someone who couldn't be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.\\
326 - Hello, Sheldon.\\
327 - (gasps)\\
328 - Professor Hawking. (chuckles)\\
329 - Happy birthday to you.\\
330 - Thank you so much.\\
331 - I can't believe you're...\\
332 - Happy birthday to you.\\
333 - Oh, you're singing.\\
334 - Well, I'm sorry.\\
335 - Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.\\
336 - Leonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we'll light the candles, and we can all sing together.\\
337 - I was crushing it, but all right.\\
338 - Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn't think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.\\
339 - (sighs)\\
340 - You know, I used to hate these hugs.\\
341 - Now they're just extremely irritating.\\
342 - Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.\\
343 - And a one, and a two...\\
344 -  Happy birthday to you \\
345 -  Happy birthday to you \\
346 -  Happy birthday, dear Sheldon \\
347 -  Happy birthday to you. \\
348 - ...to you.\\
349 - (cheering)\\
350 - So, who's taking me home?
\subsection {Episode 18: The Application Deterioration}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - I guess I'm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.\\
3 - Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?\\
4 - You mean the strong, sexy angel I can't stop thinking about?\\
5 - Who can say?\\
6 - I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.\\
7 - There's no reason you can't.\\
8 - That's easy for you to say.\\
9 - You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.\\
10 - That's just research.\\
11 - We're never going to make any money from it.\\
12 - Forget helium-- the real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug.\\
13 - It reminds me of my daddy's secret “Don't Tell Mama” juice.\\
14 - Maybe that's an idea.\\
15 - Guidance systems for drunk people.\\
16 - They have that, it's called Uber.\\
17 - Hey, in your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?\\
18 - Yeah, why?\\
19 - Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?\\
20 - Wow. Never thought about that.\\
21 - And, since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.\\
22 - Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.\\
23 - Tell me this isn't like the best episode of s*x and the City.\\
24 - Okay, I gotta ask-- why are you wearing a bow tie?\\
25 - I've never applied for a patent before.\\
26 - I wanted to make a good impression.\\
27 - Oh. Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?\\
28 - (chuckling)\\
29 - Yeah, well, you're an engineer.\\
30 - End of joke, burn.\\
31 - Come on in, fellas.\\
32 - See, he's not wearing a tie.\\
33 - Well, he's a patent attorney.\\
34 - Maybe his tie is pending.\\
35 - So, I've reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we've got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.\\
36 - That's great! Excellent.\\
37 - So what happens next?\\
38 - Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.\\
39 - Oh, I don't think there will be.\\
40 - Yes, we did our own search.\\
41 - That's nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.\\
42 - (chuckles): Get a load of this guy.\\
43 - Can you imagine if we make money with this?\\
44 - If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.\\
45 - That old sad story-- guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.\\
46 - Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.\\
47 - 75%?\\
48 - That's outrageous.\\
49 - This is our idea based on our research.\\
50 - How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?\\
51 - It's university policy.\\
52 - I know when I'm beat.\\
53 - Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?\\
54 - Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years.\\
55 - Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?\\
56 - Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.\\
57 - And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I'm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you're not entitled to an ownership share.\\
58 - Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?\\
59 - Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.\\
60 - Well, that's not fair.\\
61 - We should all get plaques.\\
62 - Sorry, but we can't sign this.\\
63 - Come on, let's go.\\
64 - Thank you for your time.\\
65 - Couple of questions about the plaque...\\
66 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
67 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
68 -  The Earth began to cool \\
69 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
70 -  We built the Wall \\
71 -  We built the pyramids \\
72 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
73 -  That all started with a big bang \\
74 -  Bang! \\
75 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x18 \\
76 - The Application Deterioration\\
77 - Original Air Date on March 10, 2016\\
78 - So, have you been having any morning sickness?\\
79 - A little.\\
80 - And it doesn't help that I've got this heightened sense of smell.\\
81 - Is that a pregnancy thing?\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies.\\
84 - No more Tagalongs, my ass.\\
85 - But now you'll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.\\
86 - Hey, guys. Hey, Penny.\\
87 - I really appreciate you helping me with this.\\
88 - I don't know what to do.\\
89 - Oh, sure. Let me see it.\\
90 - See what?\\
91 - I hadn't spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.\\
92 - “Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn't return it and thought you'd like to have it. Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily”\\
93 - That's nice.\\
94 - Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?\\
95 - I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?\\
96 - Why wouldn't you open it?\\
97 - Well, she was pretty mad.\\
98 - For all I know it's a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.\\
99 - You don't think she'd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?\\
100 - I know one way to find out-- sniff this.\\
101 - She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.\\
102 - Although I am getting a little machine oil.\\
103 - I think it's metal.\\
104 - Come on, just open it.\\
105 - You know, on Game of Thrones,\\
106 - Balon Greyjoy received his son's genitals in a box.\\
107 - Well, never hurts to have a spare.\\
108 - Bernadette: What is that?\\
109 - Wow. It's an antique sextant.\\
110 - Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.\\
111 - What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.\\
112 - I know, she's so thoughtful.\\
113 - See, she's trying to get you back.\\
114 - Now, that is exactly what I would've gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.\\
115 - You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.\\
116 - You don't need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.\\
117 - Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?\\
118 - We can't. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.\\
119 - Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says “Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.”\\
120 - Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don't do it at all.\\
121 - Either way, I get nothing.\\
122 - Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.\\
123 - To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs.\\
124 - Oh! Now they own the mugs.\\
125 - I guess that is a way around this.\\
126 - You guys would be cool doing it like that?\\
127 - Of course, we can split any profits three ways.\\
128 - I'm fine with that.\\
129 - Okay, great.\\
130 - It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.\\
131 - Sure, we could write something up.\\
132 - But which one of us should be the party who...\\
133 - You can do it, Sheldon.\\
134 - So stipulated!\\
135 - Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed.\\
136 - It was weird.\\
137 - I wonder how much she spent on this.\\
138 - Ooh, let's find out.\\
139 - It doesn't matter.\\
140 - It's the thought that counts.\\
141 - Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside, size doesn't matter-- how much she spend?\\
142 - Seriously, guys, I don't want to know.\\
143 - Oh, my.\\
144 - Oh, come on, you can't say “Oh, my,” and then not tell me!\\
145 - These things go for $500 and up.\\
146 - Bernadette: Damn.\\
147 - All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.\\
148 - Penny: Okay, so, she drops off a $500 gift and she's not trying to get back together with you?\\
149 - Maybe you're right.\\
150 - Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.\\
151 - Maybe you're right.\\
152 - Wow, I am easy to manipulate.\\
153 - (phone chiming)\\
154 - Oh, guys, it's Emily.\\
155 - What should I do?\\
156 - Okay, answer it. Just be strong.\\
157 - And if she starts to cry, don't make any promises.\\
158 - And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.\\
159 - Hello?\\
160 - Hey, it's Emily.\\
161 - Is this a good time?\\
162 - Yeah, yeah. Sure. What's up?\\
163 - Was it okay I left that gift?\\
164 - I'm really hoping we can be friends.\\
165 - Maybe, maybe.\\
166 - Um, you think you'd want to grab a cup of coffee?\\
167 - Hello?\\
168 - I'm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this!\\
169 - I just... I miss hanging out with you.\\
170 - It's not like I lost a friend, it's like I lost my best friend.\\
171 - (choking up): Is there any chance you'd want to come over?\\
172 - I'm sorry, I don't think that's a good idea.\\
173 - Okay. I'm just...\\
174 - (crying): I'm having a really hard time, but that's not your problem, that's mine.\\
175 - I-I won't bother you again, but please know that you'll always have a place in my heart.\\
176 - Bye, Raj.\\
177 - You're a good guy.\\
178 - Good-bye, Emily.\\
179 - (sighs): That was rough, you guys.\\
180 - I know, but you did it. I'm so proud of you.\\
181 - Well, anyway, I'll leave you to your girls' night.\\
182 - Are you sure you don't want to stay here with us?\\
183 - No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.\\
184 - Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.\\
185 - Thank you.\\
186 - Say hi to Emily for us.\\
187 - Will do.\\
188 - This contract looks good to me.\\
189 - I'll say it looks good.\\
190 - It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.\\
191 - I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.\\
192 - I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?\\
193 - Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.\\
194 - What is it?\\
195 - Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we're forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.\\
196 - Sheldon, did you draft the contract?\\
197 - You bet I did.\\
198 - Ooh. You're gonna make out so hard tonight.\\
199 - So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?\\
200 - Excuse me.\\
201 - I've been drafting contracts since kindergarten.\\
202 - Didn't need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting.\\
203 - Don't need one now.\\
204 - I know, but...\\
205 - Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.\\
206 - Well, I should hope so.\\
207 - The whole thing was your idea.\\
208 - Well, to be fair, Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.\\
209 - Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay?\\
210 - Howard's invention, Sheldon's math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid.\\
211 - Which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned if she wasn't working on that hangnail right now.\\
212 - What?\\
213 - Honey, this is fine.\\
214 - If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.\\
215 - Can I talk to you in the hall?\\
216 - Sure.\\
217 - Excuse us.\\
218 - Hey, Leonard.\\
219 - What?\\
220 - If she doesn't think that we should apply for this patent, she's being patently absurd.\\
221 - Good one.\\
222 - Okay, you got it.\\
223 - See, I was afraid it was a thinker.\\
224 - What are you doing?\\
225 - I just want to make sure you've thought this through.\\
226 - What's to think about?\\
227 - We have an invention and want to move forward.\\
228 - Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.\\
229 - All right, if you're gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don't know if I want to talk to you.\\
230 - Okay. I get it.\\
231 - And it's sweet that you're worried about me, but I can take care of myself.\\
232 - I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me.\\
233 - I don't want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.\\
234 - Here we go with the ironclad logic again.\\
235 - You've tried to work with him before.\\
236 - It hasn't gone well.\\
237 - Why is this time gonna be any different?\\
238 - Is the fetus helping you?\\
239 - 'Cause that's cheating.\\
240 - (phone rings)\\
241 - Hello?\\
242 - Claire: Hey, Raj.\\
243 - It's Claire. How are you?\\
244 - Hi. I'm good. Really good.\\
245 - Well, I don't know why I said “really good.”\\
246 - I'm just regular good.\\
247 - I really just wanted to sound confident.\\
248 - And that “really” was a real “really,” not a fake “really” like the first “really.”\\
249 - Really?\\
250 - I don't know. I lost track and I missed my exit.\\
251 - So, uh... so what's up?\\
252 - Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn't work out.\\
253 - Really? I'm sorry.\\
254 - I swear I know other words.\\
255 - So if you were still interested...\\
256 - Yes! Indeed! Absolutely! Indubitably!\\
257 - I'm not even sure what the last one means, but it's another word, and I know it.\\
258 - So, uh, when do you want to meet up?\\
259 - Uh, I'm almost off work.\\
260 - What are you doing now?\\
261 - R-Right now, well...\\
262 - Well, actually, to-to be completely honest, I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she's having a tough time. But... it's not like we're getting back together or anything.\\
263 - Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn't have her best friend to talk to anymore?\\
264 - That's exactly what she said!\\
265 - How do you know that?\\
266 - I'm a girl. It's, like, page one out of the playbook.\\
267 - Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?\\
268 - They've been out there a while.\\
269 - I hope everything's okay.\\
270 - I wonder what they're talking about.\\
271 - Penny: If you guys would shut up, I could tell you.\\
272 - Oh.\\
273 - Be cool, be cool, be cool.\\
274 - Hey.\\
275 - Hello.\\
276 - Hey. You guys all right?\\
277 - Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and... I'm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.\\
278 - Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation?\\
279 - 'Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.\\
280 - Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything.\\
281 - It's-it's with how you treat me.\\
282 - Well, I believe I'm treating you generously.\\
283 - That's why I've stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.\\
284 - Are you saying that his contributions aren't as valuable as yours?\\
285 - No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said, “Stop saying that”\\
286 - See? This is what happens every time we work together.\\
287 - Penny: You know what, hang on.\\
288 - What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?\\
289 - Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don't know about?\\
290 - Penny: No.\\
291 - What I'm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can't make fun of Howard.\\
292 - How would you enforce it?\\
293 - Oh, please.\\
294 - Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.\\
295 - And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.\\
296 - Yeah, that, too.\\
297 - And scoot over.\\
298 - Part of your shadow's on my spot.\\
299 - Howard, what do you think?\\
300 - I'm on board.\\
301 - I'll add it right now.\\
302 - Oh, baby, it's addendum time!\\
303 - (line ringing)\\
304 - Emily: Hello?\\
305 - Hey, Emily, listen, I've been thinking, and I'm not sure it's a good idea that I come over.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - (crying): Okay. I understand.\\
308 - No, no. Please don't cry.\\
309 - Okay, I'll stop!\\
310 - Hello?\\
311 - Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans...\\
312 - Fine. Do what you want, but she's playing you.\\
313 - I don't think so. She sounded pretty upset.\\
314 - You mean like... “I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I'm having such a rough day.”\\
315 - Emily, listen...\\
316 - I'm sorry, but I can't come by.\\
317 - Why not?\\
318 - I think we both know if I come over, we're gonna get back together and... I told you I needed a friend.\\
319 - What do you think is happening here?\\
320 - Call you right back.\\
321 - The-the revisions I made start on page four.\\
322 - Wow. That is a lot of “whereupons”.\\
323 - You should see the Valentine's Day card he gave me.\\
324 - “Article three: As it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to: mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, 'not that bad.'”\\
325 - Hang on. Maybe there should be a “no insult” clause about me, too.\\
326 - Do you still like cilantro?\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - You're tying my hands here.\\
329 - All right, let's sign this.\\
330 - Penny: Wait, wait, wait.\\
331 - What are these changes on page six?\\
332 - Sheldon, what did you do?\\
333 - Wolowitz: I should've known.\\
334 - “25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz”\\
335 - Sheldon, that's so nice.\\
336 - Leonard: That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from babyGap.\\
337 - That's very generous, Sheldon.\\
338 - Oh, I've always valued education over money.\\
339 - And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.\\
340 - I appreciate that. And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.\\
341 - Sheldon.\\
342 - What?\\
343 - I didn't sign it yet.\\
344 - I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.\\
345 - All right, it's your life.\\
346 - But you know how this is gonna end.\\
347 - As a matter of fact, I do.\\
348 - I'm gonna comfort her, because I'm a caring and decent friend who's happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.\\
349 - Good talk.

35 - This is cool.\\
36 - When was the last time you and I built something together?\\
37 - Scientifically? A little over a year ago.\\
38 - LEGOs? Last week in my room.\\
39 - If there was a Nobrize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we'd be set.\\
40 - Hey, guys!\\
41 - Both: Hey.\\
42 - What are you doing here?\\
43 - We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.\\
44 - Yeah, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for 'em.\\
45 - Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.\\
46 - So, how's it goin'?\\
47 - Good. Slow.\\
48 - There's a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.\\
49 - Is there anything we can do to help?\\
50 - You know what, this part isn't that technical.\\
51 - You actually could.\\
52 - Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.\\
53 - Can we really help?\\
54 - While we finish soldering these boards, it'd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.\\
55 - I'll show you how to do one.\\
56 - Hey, w-wouldn't it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I'm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough?\\
57 - He doesn't think that's funny.\\
58 - (static crackling)\\
59 - (gasps)\\
60 - (sighs)\\
61 - (knocking)\\
62 - I got here as quickly as I could.\\
63 - You're too late.\\
64 - ("Taps" playing)\\
65 - Sheldon, this is silly.\\
66 - You got emotional when that lab monkey died.\\
67 - That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.\\
68 -  \\
69 - ("Taps" ends)\\
70 - Great.\\
71 - Now I'm gonna have that song in my head all day.\\
72 - Look, I'm-I'm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better.\\
73 - I got you a new computer!\\
74 - How could you do that?\\
75 - Do what?\\
76 - Choosing a new laptop is an incredibly personal ritual.\\
77 - You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I j...\\
78 - Haven't I lost enough today?\\
79 - Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.\\
80 - Oh! Oh, the guy!\\
81 - Oh, pardon me.\\
82 - I-I didn't realize you'd spoken to the guy.\\
83 - Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?\\
84 - Yes.\\
85 - Yeah?\\
86 - D-Did the guy make sure that this has a one-terabyte solid-state drive?\\
87 - Yes.\\
88 - Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?\\
89 - Yes.\\
90 - Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.\\
91 - After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.\\
92 - Like this? Oh.\\
93 - Yeah, perfect.\\
94 - And it helps to have small, delicate fingers.\\
95 - So don't be discouraged if you can't do it as fast as me and Howard. (chuckles)\\
96 - I don't know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.\\
97 - We had a full spool yesterday.\\
98 - What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.\\
99 - Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off.\\
100 - It's like a beer commercial.\\
101 - (blows, clicks tongue)\\
102 - Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.\\
103 - How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?\\
104 - Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to...\\
105 - Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is-is not a funny story.\\
106 - You want to come with us?\\
107 - I'm kind of getting into the groove here.\\
108 - Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.\\
109 - Leonard: Okay.\\
110 - We'll be back as soon as we can.\\
111 - (clears throat) Okay, so what... is solder?\\
112 - I suppose I should set this up.\\
113 - Or would you like to rob me of that, too?\\
114 - Knock it off or I'll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.\\
115 - You wouldn't.\\
116 - "Hwatch" me.\\
117 - Fine. I'm sorry.\\
118 - Thank you for the thoughtful gift.\\
119 - I really do appreciate it.\\
120 - As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop.\\
121 - But I'm sure, in time, that this one will...\\
122 - (gasps) Jeepers creepers, that started up fast!\\
123 - I thought you might like it.\\
124 - Look at the 4K resolution.\\
125 - Next time we Skype, I'm gonna count all those nostril hairs.\\
126 - Or you could just look into my eyes.\\
127 - But you only have two eyes.\\
128 - You got a lot of nostril hairs.\\
129 - Well, you know, as long as you're happy.\\
130 - Oh.\\
131 - I am. (chuckles)\\
132 - And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.\\
133 - Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.\\
134 - Oh, but he said you can get store credit.\\
135 - Well, no, I just... I-I don't want to recycle it.\\
136 - And I don't want store credit.\\
137 - But why wouldn't...\\
138 - Can we please change the subject?\\
139 - O-Okay.\\
140 - How 'bout we change it to why you're being weird about this?\\
141 - I'm not being weird.\\
142 - I...\\
143 - It's hard to explain.\\
144 - Sheldon, just tell me.\\
145 - It might be easier to show you.\\
146 - Okay.\\
147 - We'd have to take your car.\\
148 - All right.\\
149 - And I'm gonna need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\\
150 - Well, I signed one before we slept together.\\
151 - Why not now?\\
152 - Penny says they're having fun working on the prototype.\\
153 - Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?\\
154 - I know. I'm lowering the bar so slowly.\\
155 - This time next year she'll have a coin collection.\\
156 - Excuse me.\\
157 - You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?\\
158 - Oh. Sorry, we can't.\\
159 - Well, hang on. What movie is it?\\
160 - Oh, I can't tell you. But it does star Will Smith.\\
161 - Wait.\\
162 - I bet it's Suicide Squad.\\
163 - Let's check it out.\\
164 - What about the girls?\\
165 - Penny just said they're having fun.\\
166 - Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?\\
167 - Okay, we'll take 'em.\\
168 - Okay. But, I swear, if it's Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.\\
169 - I mean, it's crazy, isn't it?\\
170 - I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I'm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.\\
171 - It is crazy. It's also crazy that I've made 14 of these and you've made three.\\
172 - (knocking)\\
173 - Hey. Where are the guys?\\
174 - Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.\\
175 - Since when do you work on weekends?\\
176 - I'm an astrophysicist.\\
177 - The stars don't take a day off.\\
178 - You were home alone and had no one to play with?\\
179 - Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn't like me.\\
180 - You need any help?\\
181 - Not with Lightning McQueen here.\\
182 - I think we're good.\\
183 - Okay. That's cool.\\
184 - I guess everybody's involved in this project but me.\\
185 - So... see ya.\\
186 - (door shuts)\\
187 - I feel bad.\\
188 - Should we have asked him to stay?\\
189 - Koothrappali (high-pitched): Yes.\\
190 - Will you please tell me where we're going?\\
191 - Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.\\
192 - I'm driving the car. I need to know.\\
193 - Right.\\
194 - So where are we going?\\
195 - No, I meant turn right, and you missed it.\\
196 - Maybe you do need to know.\\
197 - (indistinct chatter)\\
198 - What are we gonna tell the girls?\\
199 - It's not a problem.\\
200 - I mean without lying.\\
201 - And now you've made it a problem.\\
202 - Come on. We're a couple of smart guys.\\
203 - I'm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn't make us look bad.\\
204 - (phone chimes)\\
205 - Oh!\\
206 - The boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.\\
207 - (phone chimes)\\
208 - They bought it.\\
209 - But we're gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.\\
210 - Oh, you're good at this.\\
211 - Well, I lie a lot.\\
212 - Man: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You're about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.\\
213 - (applause and cheering)\\
214 - Hey!\\
215 - (laughs) You were right.\\
216 - Oh, I keep telling you-- good things happen to bad people.\\
217 - Uh, we're gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.\\
218 - Who are you texting?\\
219 - Raj. He really wants to see this movie.\\
220 - Oh, he'll never make it in time.\\
221 - I know. I want to make him feel bad.\\
222 - "Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad.\\
223 - Spoiler alert: when I see you I'm gonna spoil it."\\
224 - You're a good friend.\\
225 - (chuckles)\\
226 - (phone chimes)\\
227 - Okay. (clears throat)\\
228 - Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?\\
229 - Why?\\
230 - I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.\\
231 - What's going on?\\
232 - Leonard and Howard don't have a flat.\\
233 - They went to the movies. Look.\\
234 - Son of a bitch. Un-freakin' believable.\\
235 - Oh. You know what? I'm gonna let them know that I'm here with you and that they're busted.\\
236 - No. You know what? Don't. Don't.\\
237 - Let's let them think they're getting away with it.\\
238 - Yeah, let's see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.\\
239 - Mm-hmm. Interesting.\\
240 - I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.\\
241 - Why do you have a storage unit?\\
242 - Just wait.\\
243 - How long have you had it?\\
244 - Just wait.\\
245 - Do you want me to hold that computer?\\
246 - Just wai... You know what? Actually, yes, thank you.\\
247 - Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.\\
248 - I'm sorry.\\
249 - What-what am I looking at?\\
250 - It's basically everything I've ever owned.\\
251 - Um, every book, every T-shirt, every piece of broken electronics.\\
252 - Just... all of it.\\
253 - All of it?\\
254 - I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.\\
255 - Okay.\\
256 - Well...\\
257 - I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of.\\
258 - So I'm gonna need a minute.\\
259 - All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?\\
260 - I know.\\
261 - You guys should totally be making out with me.\\
262 - Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?\\
263 - No, ma'am.\\
264 - Okay. Okay, how about this?\\
265 - They don't know you're here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we'll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we'll pretend to believe them, and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.\\
266 - Yeah, that's pretty good. I love it!\\
267 - I'll be all like, "Busted!"\\
268 - And they'll be like, "What?!"\\
269 - And then we'll all be like, "Oh, yeah!"\\
270 - Yeah, I-I get it.\\
271 - I wouldn't make out with me, either.\\
272 - In here is every clock radio I've ever owned.\\
273 - Calculators, VHS tapes.\\
274 - Yeah. Oh.\\
275 - Sporting equipment.\\
276 - Y-You have sporting equipment?\\
277 - Well, oh, it's just a... it's a... a golf ball that my brother threw at my head.\\
278 - You can still feel the dent.\\
279 - It's right next to the hockey puck dent.\\
280 - Okay, why do you have a bin of pinecones?\\
281 - I used to collect them as a child.\\
282 - The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence.\\
283 - A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.\\
284 - So, why do you feel you need to save these things?\\
285 - I'd like to say it's nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach.\\
286 - And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then, the-the rats get eaten by...\\
287 - Okay.\\
288 - I get it. I get it.\\
289 - It ends with dinosaurs.\\
290 - I'm sorry if you think less of me.\\
291 - I don't.\\
292 - Really?\\
293 - 'Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.\\
294 - Why?\\
295 - Because I'm a fraud.\\
296 - No. I purport to be a man of the mind.\\
297 - I've been such a-a vocal champion of The Singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the Internet when I've never even thrown a toothbrush away?\\
298 - It's okay, Sheldon.\\
299 - You know, I... I've saved a lot of weird things, too.\\
300 - Like what?\\
301 - Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?\\
302 - I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.\\
303 - It's not a contest.\\
304 - Okay, here they come. Go hide.\\
305 - Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I'm gonna nail those guys!\\
306 - Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.\\
307 - Hey.\\
308 - Hi.\\
309 - Hey, what's this?\\
310 - Listen, we did a stupid thing.\\
311 - We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.\\
312 - So, these are for you, and if you're not too mad, we'd love to take you guys to dinner.\\
313 - Wolowitz: Yeah.\\
314 - Anywhere you want.\\
315 - Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.\\
316 - Penny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.\\
317 - Koothrappali: Don't forgive them! Stay mad at them!\\
318 - What is he doing in there?\\
319 - Busting you!\\
320 - It's okay. They apologized.\\
321 - Yeah, it's fine.\\
322 - Well this is kind of anti-climactic.\\
323 - You know what wasn't anti-climactic?\\
324 - The end of the movie. Get this.\\
325 - No spoilers! No spoilers!\\
326 - And he's back in the closet.\\
327 - Ready for dinner?\\
328 - Yeah.\\
329 - Should we invite Raj?\\
330 - Koothrappali (high-pitched): Yes.\\
331 - So, no one else knows about this?\\
332 - Only you.\\
333 - Thank you for trusting me.\\
334 - What good is having a girlfriend if you can't unload your psychological sewage on her?\\
335 - That's me, your emotional outhouse.\\
336 - You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I'm-I'm here for you.\\
337 - Thank you.\\
338 - I wouldn't even know how to begin.\\
339 - Baby steps, I guess.\\
340 - Mm.\\
341 - I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.\\
342 - Oh. Okay.\\
343 - I will always have the dent to remember it by.\\
344 - (sighs heavily)\\
345 - You did it.\\
346 - Do you feel okay?\\
347 - Actually, yes.\\
348 - I do.\\
349 - Well, I'm proud of you.\\
350 - Oh. Thanks.\\
351 - I'm glad I told you about the storage unit.\\
352 - Well, I feel closer to you now.\\
353 - Oh, I feel closer to you, too.\\
354 - You know, it's still a couple of hours until my bedtime.\\
355 - What did you have in mind?\\
356 - You look amazing.\\
357 - I mean, this resolution is remarkable.\\
358 - I really had to go home for this?\\
359 - Yes, but it's like you're right here in the room.\\
360 - And yet, I'm not.\\
361 - But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.\\
362 - And yet, you can't.\\
363 - I know!

48 - Yeah... (clears throat) Excuse me.\\
49 - Here, look up "fun," get back to me.\\
50 - You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.\\
51 - Sure.\\
52 - Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.\\
53 - I hardly think so.\\
54 - You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.\\
55 - I'll see if it's available.\\
56 - You know, if that study's real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.\\
57 - Are you trying to manipulate me?\\
58 - Yes.\\
59 - Well done, it worked, we're going.\\
60 - Yay!\\
61 - (bags rustling)\\
62 - Bernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag.\\
63 - No, no, you're pregnant.\\
64 - The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.\\
65 - Hey, where you been?\\
66 - Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.\\
67 - (tires screeching on game)\\
68 - Did you get graham crackers?\\
69 - I mean, are... what... is the baby okay?\\
70 - Yes and yes.\\
71 - (sighs)\\
72 - I didn't know you needed help running errands today.\\
73 - I didn't, but Raj volunteered.\\
74 - Really?\\
75 - Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he's really been making a fuss over me.\\
76 - Oh. Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.\\
77 - Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles.\\
78 - I know my favorite, but I'd love to hear what you think.\\
79 - And it just got weird.\\
80 - Hey. Amy's downstairs.\\
81 - Okay, one sec.\\
82 - Uh, what-what you got goin' on here?\\
83 - I bought a baseball cap.\\
84 - I can see that.\\
85 - What team did you get?\\
86 - Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.\\
87 - Well, we'll be in the woods.\\
88 - I'm ready to go.\\
89 - Anything you'd like to say to him?\\
90 - Nice hat, Sheldon.\\
91 - Thanks.\\
92 - Why are you so mean to me?\\
93 - (woman screaming in pain)\\
94 - (screaming continues)\\
95 - What the hell are you watching?\\
96 - Raj found all these childbirth videos online.\\
97 - This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.\\
98 - Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I've ever seen in my life.\\
99 - You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?\\
100 - I don't think so.\\
101 - He just wants to be part of the experience.\\
102 - All right, if you say so.\\
103 - What's in the box?\\
104 - Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.\\
105 - Oh.\\
106 - That's cool.\\
107 - Can we try it?\\
108 - Actually, Raj ordered it.\\
109 - He made me promise to wait till he was here.\\
110 - So he can be... part of the experience?\\
111 - Yeah.\\
112 - I'm surprised he let us conceive without him.\\
113 - It's a sore spot-- don't bring it up.\\
114 - It's so cute and rustic up here.\\
115 - I know.\\
116 - Did you see they still have a video rental place? it's like Colonial Williamsburg.\\
117 - Well... cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now's the time.\\
118 - Have you ever been off the grid before?\\
119 - Once.\\
120 - The battery ran out on my phone.\\
121 - I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.\\
122 - I was afraid he was gonna eat me.\\
123 - Raj just pulled up.\\
124 - I'm gonna say something to him.\\
125 - Leave it alone. He means well.\\
126 - So you don't think he needs to rein it in a little?\\
127 - No, not really.\\
128 - And you're not concerned he's acting like somehow this is his kid, too?\\
129 - He's just trying to be supportive.\\
130 - Just supportive.\\
131 - Not over-the-top in any way?\\
132 - No.\\
133 - Koothrappali: Hello!\\
134 - You saw him carrying that.\\
135 - Astronauts saw him carrying that.\\
136 - (gasps)\\
137 - This place is great!\\
138 - So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.\\
139 - Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.\\
140 - Okay.\\
141 - Well, should we check each other for ticks?\\
142 - Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.\\
143 - Oh. Well, suit yourself.\\
144 - Who wants to check me?\\
145 - On the other hand, safety first.\\
146 - (rain falling loudly)\\
147 - Wow, it's really coming down.\\
148 - This sucks.\\
149 - And there goes our hike.\\
150 - Oh, not our hike!\\
151 - Now we have to stay safe and warm.\\
152 - You know, we could still go.\\
153 - A little rain isn't gonna kill us.\\
154 - Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?\\
155 - No.\\
156 - You'll wish it would kill you.\\
157 - So what do we do now?\\
158 - They have some board games.\\
159 - Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word "SHNERPF" next to it, move on.\\
160 - Hey, let's light a fire.\\
161 - Ooh, that sounds cozy.\\
162 - I don't think I've lit a real fire before.\\
163 - Ah, it's basic thermodynamics.\\
164 - I'm sure we can figure that out.\\
165 - I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.\\
166 - That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.\\
167 - (fire whooshes)\\
168 - Right. So all we need is to...\\
169 - Got it.\\
170 - A scientist made that.\\
171 - Look, Raj, you're my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.\\
172 - Please, my pleasure.\\
173 - And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.\\
174 - But we have to set some boundaries.\\
175 - I don't understand.\\
176 - The three of us aren't having this baby.\\
177 - Just the two of us.\\
178 - Oh...\\
179 - Okay. Yeah, I get it.\\
180 - I'll back off.\\
181 - Thanks for understanding.\\
182 - Of course.\\
183 - I'll give you guys some space.\\
184 - Let me just get this out of your way.\\
185 - You need some help?\\
186 - No, I got it.\\
187 - (clattering)\\
188 - (grunts)\\
189 - Raj... Raj, wait.\\
190 - Please, Bernadette.\\
191 - Let me leave with my dignity.\\
192 - (thumps)\\
193 - Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?\\
194 - Oh, well now, well now, we'll never win.\\
195 - You always play the drinking game.\\
196 - Not the drinking game, a drinking game.\\
197 - To be fair, good at both.\\
198 - What's the game?\\
199 - All right, it's called Never Have I Ever.\\
200 - The rules are simple.\\
201 - Someone says something they've never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.\\
202 - I've never played that before.\\
203 - (stammers) Hey, now, wait.\\
204 - Have we started?\\
205 - Do I drink?\\
206 - What is happening?\\
207 - Okay.\\
208 - Calm down.\\
209 - I'll go first.\\
210 - All right, let's see.\\
211 - Never have I ever...\\
212 - She's trying to think of something she's never done before.\\
213 - This could take a while.\\
214 - Very funny.\\
215 - Okay, never have I ever...\\
216 - Yeah, you know what?\\
217 - Let's just circle back.\\
218 - Okay, I'll go.\\
219 - Never have I ever been arrested.\\
220 - So I drink.\\
221 - No, it's only if you've done it.\\
222 - Got it.\\
223 - I can't believe you've been arrested.\\
224 - I can't believe Penny hasn't.\\
225 - Sheldon, what did you do?\\
226 - Well, I'm not proud of it, but... I jaywalked.\\
227 - Oh, no, it's like a horror movie.\\
228 - We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.\\
229 - I'm surprised you would do that.\\
230 - No, I crossed in the middle of the street.\\
231 - And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season.\\
232 - Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.\\
233 - What-- he arrested you for that?\\
234 - (stammers) No, he didn't do anything.\\
235 - So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk. Why aren't you doing your job?"\\
236 - You know?\\
237 - "M-Maybe I should arrest you for-for impersonating a police officer."\\
238 - And then you got arrested.\\
239 - Oh, and how.\\
240 - I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.\\
241 - Yeah.\\
242 - But on the other hand, I didn't kick him out of our lives.\\
243 - I just asked him to back off a little.\\
244 - Yeah.\\
245 - What? Are you gonna cry?\\
246 - (crying): Yeah!\\
247 - Is it baby hormones or actually sad?\\
248 - I can't tell anymore!\\
249 - I'll go get him.\\
250 - And bring back the bear!\\
251 - This game's dangerous.\\
252 - I could get you in trouble.\\
253 - How?\\
254 - Well, never have I ever used Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.\\
255 - Fine, is that how you want to play this?\\
256 - All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.\\
257 - Never should've told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.\\
258 - Amy: Okay.\\
259 - My turn.\\
260 - Um...\\
261 - Never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend's world in bed.\\
262 - (stammers) Amy...\\
263 - You know the rules.\\
264 - Drink.\\
265 - (clears throat)\\
266 - Yeah, go ahead.\\
267 - That's right.\\
268 - All right, my turn.\\
269 - Mm...\\
270 - Oh, I know.\\
271 - Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can't handle money.\\
272 - Did I win?\\
273 - I feel like I won.\\
274 - I can't believe this.\\
275 - You realize I make more money than you?\\
276 - I don't, I know, but this isn't a big deal.\\
277 - It's just a little savings I put aside.\\
278 - We're married.\\
279 - We're supposed to share everything.\\
280 - What-- you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?\\
281 - (door slams)\\
282 - I'm calling it.\\
283 - I won.\\
284 - I appreciate the apology, but it's really not necessary.\\
285 - I overstepped my bounds.\\
286 - No, Raj, you've been great.\\
287 - I just, I need to start doing my part around here.\\
288 - Bernadette: I hear that.\\
289 - Well, if that's the case, is there anything I can do to help?\\
290 - Well, not right now.\\
291 - But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby's heartbeat.\\
292 - Really?\\
293 - It's okay if I listen with you?!\\
294 - Of course.\\
295 - Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?\\
296 - Hey, look at that.\\
297 - It's weird again.\\
298 - (door opens)\\
299 - Okay, you have every right to be mad.\\
300 - And what you said is true.\\
301 - You do make more money than me.\\
302 - So I had no right to do what I did.\\
303 - And I'm so sorry.\\
304 - I hope you can forgive me.\\
305 - How long have you had this secret account?\\
306 - A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.\\
307 - Well, how much you got in there?\\
308 - $6,427.\\
309 - $47 once my nana's birthday check gets here.\\
310 - My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?\\
311 - No, I do, and that's why I hid it.\\
312 - What good is it if you don't use it?\\
313 - Uh, uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear.\\
314 - I have money I love, but never spend.\\
315 - We're kind of a cute couple that way.\\
316 - Again, I'm sorry.\\
317 - I shouldn't have kept it a secret.\\
318 - Well, I have a secret I've been keeping from you, too.\\
319 - Is it a secret bank account?\\
320 - Because that would be awesome.\\
321 - I hate my job.\\
322 - Really?\\
323 - Why?\\
324 - Because I don't feel good flirting with doctors for sales.\\
325 - I mean, I know I make a lot of money.\\
326 - But I haven't been happy for a while.\\
327 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
328 - Because I know how important it is to you that I'm having some success.\\
329 - That's not true.\\
330 - Okay, really? So you'd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?\\
331 - If that's what you want to do, yes.\\
332 - Well, it's not what I want to do.\\
333 - Oh, yes.\\
334 - Doesn't matter what I want.\\
335 - Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt.\\
336 - So I'm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.\\
337 - Well, that is the grown-up thing.\\
338 - I guess.\\
339 - I love you.\\
340 - I love you, too.\\
341 - You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.\\
342 - Well, guess I gotta drink.\\
343 - All right, here we go.\\
344 - (microphone droning)\\
345 - I'm not hearing anything.\\
346 - Well, give me a second.\\
347 - Are you sure you can do this?\\
348 - Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?\\
349 - I buried it there, so we could go home.\\
350 - (heartbeat echoing, gasps)\\
351 - Wait, that's it.\\
352 - Wow.\\
353 - Isn't that the best?\\
354 - You guys made a person.\\
355 - We did.\\
356 - And I like to think I helped.\\
357 - (whispering): You didn't.\\
358 - Sheldon: Oh, let me see.\\
359 - Oh, um, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.\\
360 - Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.\\
361 - Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.\\
362 - Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.\\
363 - Oh!\\
364 - Uh... never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.\\
365 - Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.\\
366 - Yeah...\\
367 - Oh!\\
368 - Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.\\
369 - (gasps)\\
370 - Well, we all have a past.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Viewing Party Combustion}
1 - I have a question about Batman.\\
2 - Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.\\
3 - Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid.\\
4 - Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?\\
5 - No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.\\
6 - But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?\\
7 - But Batman is a man.\\
8 - You're talking about a man who would have the powers of a man.\\
9 - That's just Man-Man.\\
10 - Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?\\
11 - But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?\\
12 - Well, that's just Batman.\\
13 - No, if a man dresses as a bat, that's Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that's Batman-Man.\\
14 - (cell phone chimes)\\
15 - So does that answer your question?\\
16 - Oh, I haven't asked it yet.\\
17 - Oh, that's Claire. Got to run.\\
18 - I thought you were back with Emily.\\
19 - Uh, actually I'm... seeing both of them.\\
20 - You mean like through their window from behind a bush?\\
21 - No, I'm actually dating two women.\\
22 - Later.\\
23 - (chuckles) Really?\\
24 - The guy who for years couldn't even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them?\\
25 - How is that possible?\\
26 - Wolowitz: I know.\\
27 - Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.\\
28 - Seriously, that guy's dating two women?\\
29 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
30 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
31 -  The Earth began to cool \\
32 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
33 -  We built the Wall \\
34 -  We built the pyramids \\
35 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
36 -  That all started with a big bang \\
37 -  Bang! \\
38 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x21 \\
39 - The Viewing Party Combustion\\
40 - Original Air Date on April 20, 2016\\
41 - What, why did you get a party sub?\\
42 - People are coming over; it looked fun.\\
43 - Well, we're only watching Game of Thrones.\\
44 - A party sub implies it's a party.\\
45 - Your attendance implies it's not.\\
46 - I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn't like a party.\\
47 - Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is our quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.\\
48 - Oh, Sheldon, we don't need a meeting every three months.\\
49 - Hmm?\\
50 - Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.\\
51 - Lucky for you it's tomorrow.\\
52 - Oh, you know what?\\
53 - I'm not going.\\
54 - Well, you have to go.\\
55 - It's Penny's first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.\\
56 - This meeting is a waste of time.\\
57 - Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.\\
58 - You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.\\
59 - You're the only one who eats them!\\
60 - And yet you get to weigh in.\\
61 - Democracy-- it's pretty cool, isn't it?\\
62 - I'm not going; you can't make me.\\
63 - Well, we'll just see about that.\\
64 - What is the problem?\\
65 - He says he's not coming to the Roommate Agreement meeting tomorrow.\\
66 - Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?\\
67 - You have fun. I will not be attending.\\
68 - Oh, fine. We don't have to have a Roommate Agreement meeting if you don't want to.\\
69 - Thank you. Of course, it will require a vote.\\
70 - Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.\\
71 - You're being ridiculous.\\
72 - There's a motion on the floor, "I'm ridiculous."\\
73 - Do we have a second?\\
74 - Hmm? Hmm?\\
75 - There is no second.\\
76 - The motion is denied.\\
77 - Next time, make sure you have the votes first.\\
78 - That was embarrassing.\\
79 - Can you please talk to him?\\
80 - Well, why are you fighting him on this?\\
81 - Because I am tired of him always getting his way.\\
82 - We don't need a stupid meeting.\\
83 - We don't even need a Roommate Agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party!\\
84 - Well, I will still come to your meeting.\\
85 - Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow's picture day.\\
86 - Why are you taking his side?\\
87 - Because it's important to him, and when we signed the Roommate Agreement, we made a deal.\\
88 - Y-You keep talking like that, you're gonna make color guard.\\
89 - (video game sound effects over TV)\\
90 - Man, I'm worn out.\\
91 - I know.\\
92 - Imagine if we were actually moving.\\
93 - No, it's just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it's exhausting.\\
94 - You're exhausted?\\
95 - Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.\\
96 - But, dude, you're so lucky.\\
97 - Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.\\
98 - I guess I am lucky.\\
99 - You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can't even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment.\\
100 - I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at Claire's or am I at Emily's?\\
101 - Is there a third girl I've forgotten about?"\\
102 - Like...\\
103 - "Where am I?"\\
104 - Hey, Raj.\\
105 - Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?\\
106 - Good. A little tired.\\
107 - I feel you. I've been dating multiple women.\\
108 - You sure you don't want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?\\
109 - You guys have fun.\\
110 - I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.\\
111 - Oh, that sounds great-- a bed to yourself.\\
112 - Can't even remember what that's like.\\
113 - Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?\\
114 - Mm, I think so.\\
115 - Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.\\
116 - Oh, I don't know.\\
117 - Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.\\
118 - (singsongy): Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.\\
119 - Leave me alone.\\
120 - If it's because you lost a stick, I know where it went.\\
121 - Not funny.\\
122 - You know you're gonna make up with him.\\
123 - Can we just skip to that part?\\
124 - Oh, of course, because I'm the only adult around here.\\
125 - Really? The only adult?\\
126 - Yeah, that's right.\\
127 - Sheldon: You know, excuse me.\\
128 - Tonight I'll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for "Mature Audiences," buster.\\
129 - All right, you would think "the only adult" wouldn't let something silly ruin our entire night.\\
130 - And I'd think you'd understand why I'm annoyed.\\
131 - All this could be avoided if you'd just come to the meeting.\\
132 - I don't want to.\\
133 - Oh, it's just a meeting.\\
134 - One simple meeting.\\
135 - Stop saying "meeting"!\\
136 -  Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting \\
137 -  Banana-fana, fo-feeting \\
138 -  Fee-fi mo-meeting... \\
139 - I brought my famous spinach dip.\\
140 - Yo, Amy, just one second.\\
141 -  Meeting. \\
142 - I'm not sure if I'm hoping for a boy or a girl.\\
143 - I mean, if it's a boy, I'm gonna have to teach him to play catch.\\
144 - (chuckles) Which means I'm gonna have to Google "How to play catch."\\
145 - If it's a girl, I mean... they're so innocent and... you know how guys are.\\
146 - Totally, guys are the worst.\\
147 - I mean, look at me.\\
148 - I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire's fridge that night.\\
149 - I'm such a dog.\\
150 - There you go again.\\
151 - I'm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?\\
152 - Actually, what you're doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.\\
153 - How could you say that?\\
154 - (imitates Koothrappali): "Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."\\
155 - I never said that.\\
156 - "Don't you hate it when you can't remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?"\\
157 - Okay, that I said.\\
158 - But that's a real problem!\\
159 - You give a girl another woman's bra, and you will not be having s*x with her that night.\\
160 - Maybe the other girl, but not her.\\
161 - What's going on with him?\\
162 - Oh, he's all bent out of shape about having a Roommate Agreement meeting.\\
163 - Apparently, perfect attendance isn't cool anymore.\\
164 - Don't worry, he'll come around.\\
165 - Well, I get why he's annoyed.\\
166 - Well, then you don't understand what's happening.\\
167 - See... Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.\\
168 - This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.\\
169 - You love The Simpsons.\\
170 - I love Lisa Simpson.\\
171 - Well, I know how he feels.\\
172 - I never enjoyed our Relationship Agreement meetings.\\
173 - (gasps) Wait.\\
174 - You were pretending?\\
175 - Sorry.\\
176 - No!\\
177 - I don't believe you.\\
178 - I could tell.\\
179 - "Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."\\
180 - Hmm, what do you think?\\
181 - You don't know?\\
182 - Hey, did I say something to upset you?\\
183 - No, I'm fine.\\
184 - Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.\\
185 - Just drop it.\\
186 - Okay, I think I see what's happening here.\\
187 - You're jealous of me.\\
188 - Oh, please.\\
189 - What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?\\
190 - It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.\\
191 - Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.\\
192 - Gladly.\\
193 - Leonard: Oh, good, go.\\
194 - You know, it'll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, "I read the books. Don't get too fond of this character."\\
195 - It's not always because they die.\\
196 - In one case, it's because they've become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time.\\
197 - Yeah, but I won't say who it is.\\
198 - It's Bran!\\
199 - Wait, what is going on?\\
200 - Leonard's being a jerk, so we're gonna watch over here, Do you guys want to watch with us?\\
201 - As long as I don't have to watch with him.\\
202 - Fine, I don't want to watch with you either.\\
203 - I'll go over here.\\
204 - Why do you get to pick?\\
205 - Okay, then you go there!\\
206 - Don't tell me where to go!\\
207 - Howard, just come in here.\\
208 - Yeah, come on, Raj.\\
209 - Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?\\
210 - She did.\\
211 - And I'm gonna eat it all!\\
212 - (door slams)\\
213 - So what the hell happened?\\
214 - Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon's nonsense.\\
215 - Tell me about it. I've had it with Raj, too.\\
216 - You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle.\\
217 - Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.\\
218 - Interesting.\\
219 - Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj's actual period.\\
220 - If Sheldon's testosterone dipped, he'd become a butterfly.\\
221 - (knocking on door)\\
222 - Oh.\\
223 - Maybe someone's here to apologize.\\
224 - Hey, Leonard.\\
225 - Stuart.\\
226 - Uh...\\
227 - Is this not a dress-up party?\\
228 - No.\\
229 - Was it ever a dress-up party?\\
230 - No.\\
231 - Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?\\
232 - Yeah. (chuckles)\\
233 - (knocking on door)\\
234 - I was told this is where to go if I'm mad at Howard.\\
235 - May I take your cloak?\\
236 - Thanks.\\
237 - This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.\\
238 - Well, I'll catch you up.\\
239 - Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard's angry at me and Penny, I'm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I'm angry at George R.R. Martin 'cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.\\
240 - So what happened with you and Howard?\\
241 - Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.\\
242 - I'm jealous.\\
243 - Closest I've come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.\\
244 - I don't know how you put up with it.\\
245 - He's impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.\\
246 - Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.\\
247 - Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.\\
248 - Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.\\
249 - Sorry?\\
250 - Well, I just took your side 'cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.\\
251 - Well, they argue all the time.\\
252 - They aren't that close.\\
253 - Who's always comforting him when he's upset?\\
254 - Penny, but...\\
255 - Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?\\
256 - I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.\\
257 - Okay.\\
258 - And did you know she has him add things to the Roommate Agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?\\
259 - Son of a bitch.\\
260 - (laughs)\\
261 - Why is that funny?\\
262 - I don't know. I like the pain of others.\\
263 - (laughs)\\
264 - Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this.\\
265 - Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.\\
266 - No, she doesn't.\\
267 - She defends him all the time.\\
268 - She does not.\\
269 - Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?\\
270 - Well, she did.\\
271 - And human resources.\\
272 - Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?\\
273 - Son of a bitch.\\
274 - (laughs)\\
275 - You're right, it feels good.\\
276 - All right, it's almost game time.\\
277 - Get it?\\
278 - Game of Thrones, game time?\\
279 - Two women, huh?\\
280 - (Game of Thrones theme playing on TV, knocking on door)\\
281 - Oh, perhaps it's Amy coming to her senses.\\
282 - (music stops)\\
283 - What's up?\\
284 - You know, you don't need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb Roommate Agreement.\\
285 - Where'd you get that from?\\
286 - From Amy.\\
287 - Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?\\
288 - Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.\\
289 - I don't always defend Sheldon.\\
290 - Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.\\
291 - What about your weird relationship with him?\\
292 - That's different.\\
293 - I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he's the creepy thing in the TV.\\
294 - Wolowitz: Um, guys?\\
295 - Were there any nuts in that food?\\
296 - I don't think so. Why?\\
297 - Well... just a feeling. (chuckles)\\
298 - It just said "Italian sub."\\
299 - I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.\\
300 - Interesting fact: In Italian, the "morta" in "mortadella" means death.\\
301 - Sheldon.\\
302 - I didn't say "fun" fact. I'm not a monster.\\
303 - He's gonna be okay.\\
304 - (all sighing)\\
305 - Now it's a fun fact.\\
306 - Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.\\
307 - Why are you dressed like that?\\
308 - Oh, uh, Howard thought it'd be funny to tell me it was a costume party.\\
309 - That wasn't nice.\\
310 - No, but he almost died, so we're cool.\\
311 - You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.\\
312 - How?\\
313 - Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.\\
314 - Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.\\
315 - Okay.\\
316 - But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King's Guard to do her bidding.\\
317 - Cersei uses her body to manipulate men.\\
318 - Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.\\
319 - Okay. Oh, how about this?\\
320 - Stuart's dressed like a brother of the Night's Watch, and they don't have s*x.\\
321 - There you go. That's true.\\
322 - Fair enough.\\
323 - Hey.\\
324 - Hey.\\
325 - You all right?\\
326 - I'm fine.\\
327 - Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby.\\
328 - Thanks.\\
329 - Let's get out of here.\\
330 - That was scary.\\
331 - Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.\\
332 - Koothrappali: Hey, Jon Snow!\\
333 - How come your horse has a basket on it?\\
334 - How come your head has your face on it?\\
335 - They don't wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones.\\
336 - You're thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.\\
337 - Don't you guys have anything better to do?\\
338 - Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl's bike? Nope.\\
339 - That's it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store.\\
340 - (muttering): Horse has a basket on it. Stupid...\\
341 - (screams, grunts)\\
342 - (knocks)\\
343 - Sheldon: Leonard.\\
344 - (knocks) Leonard. (knocks) Leonard.\\
345 - What?\\
346 - I never got to ask my question about Batman.\\
347 - What is it?\\
348 - If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?\\
349 - Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?\\
350 - I'll be back.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Fermentation Bifurcation}
1 - Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.\\
2 - That sounds fun. Mm-hmm.\\
3 - How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?\\
4 - 'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.\\
5 - We're in it for the groupies.\\
6 - Sheldon: Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning.\\
7 - I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.\\
8 - But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.\\
9 - I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don't remember.\\
10 - All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.\\
11 - I would love to.\\
12 - I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.\\
13 - I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.\\
14 - Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.\\
15 - Wine again?\\
16 - Yeah, no, thank you.\\
17 - I like my grapes the old-fashioned way: in a juice box.\\
18 - Well, I'm going.\\
19 - You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you're not stopping me now.\\
20 - I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.\\
21 - And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.\\
22 - The little choo-choo for toddlers?\\
23 - And now you know why I needed the massage.\\
24 - Well, we're out.\\
25 - Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant.\\
26 - And she's pregnant because we had s*x.\\
27 - And we had s*x because...\\
28 - (laughs): well, come on.\\
29 - It's okay. You should go.\\
30 - You sure?\\
31 - Of course.\\
32 - Yeah, give her a break from, “Well, come on.”\\
33 - Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.\\
34 - Me? How? Why?\\
35 - Well, it makes perfect sense.\\
36 - Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol.\\
37 - I don't like to.\\
38 - You can't have sushi.\\
39 - I don't like to.\\
40 - You can't go in hot tubs.\\
41 - I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.\\
42 - Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.\\
43 - Oh, come on.\\
44 - Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs--\\
45 - I've been avoiding these things all my life.\\
46 - And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.\\
47 - The difference is she's bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.\\
48 - I guess we could give it a try.\\
49 - Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty; get ready to party hardly.\\
50 - I bet you'd like a drink right now.\\
51 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
52 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
53 -  The Earth began to cool \\
54 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
55 -  We built the Wall \\
56 -  We built the pyramids \\
57 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
58 -  That all started with a big bang \\
59 -  Bang! \\
60 -  The Big Bang Theory 9x22 \\
61 - The Fermentation Bifurcation\\
62 - Original Air Date on April 28, 2016\\
63 - Hey, you think it'd be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?\\
64 - Sure. I'd like to meet her.\\
65 - Oh, that's great.\\
66 - I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.\\
67 - Oh, but I won't be there.\\
68 - Funny how that worked out.\\
69 - Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?\\
70 - No, I'm still dating her.\\
71 - Okay, help me out.\\
72 - How are you doing this?\\
73 - Do they know about each other?\\
74 - They know that we're not exclusive, and we just don't ask too many questions.\\
75 - You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.\\
76 - Who's Frank and Alicia?\\
77 - Y... You and I spend a lot of time together.\\
78 - Can there be a little mystery between us?\\
79 - Wolowitz: Okay.\\
80 - Everything's hooked up. We're ready.\\
81 - I am going to record this for posterity.\\
82 - All right, here goes nothing.\\
83 - Here goes nothing?\\
84 - This is the initial test of our prototype.\\
85 - Can we give it a little more gravitas?\\
86 - Leonard: Fine.\\
87 - Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system: phase one commencing.\\
88 - Eh... maybe it's your voice.\\
89 - I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.\\
90 - (chuckles)\\
91 - Ooh.\\
92 - Wow.\\
93 - It's... it's-it's beautiful.\\
94 - Actually, it's making me dizzy.\\
95 - Good, it's not just me. (chuckles)\\
96 - Claire: Hello.\\
97 - Hey, Claire.\\
98 - Hey, what's up?\\
99 - Hi, yeah.\\
100 - Um, I was wondering, if you're free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.\\
101 - Sure, I guess.\\
102 - If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.\\
103 - Why would it be too big a step?\\
104 - I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.\\
105 - Nothing to worry about.\\
106 - People meet people all the time, and it isn't weird.\\
107 - I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird.\\
108 - Turns out, total sweetheart.\\
109 - Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual.\\
110 - Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend?\\
111 - What if I like them and they don't like me?\\
112 - What if they like me and I don't like them?\\
113 - Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi.\\
114 - I said, “You rock,” he said, “Thanks, man,” and that was that.\\
115 - (sniffs)\\
116 - Hey, you ready to go?\\
117 - Hang on. What are you doing?\\
118 - Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting.\\
119 - It teaches the different flavor notes to look for.\\
120 - You actually smell the wine?\\
121 - I mostly just smell my nasal spray.\\
122 - Are your sinuses acting up?\\
123 - Since my preschool got a bunny.\\
124 - Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?\\
125 - Yes.\\
126 - And we're going to prove that we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.\\
127 - Oh, good for you.\\
128 - Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and Jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.\\
129 - No HoneyBaked Ham in a hot tub-- got it.\\
130 - Oh, no bubble baths either.\\
131 - They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.\\
132 - Okay, have fun.\\
133 - Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.\\
134 - We're leaving now!\\
135 - Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes...\\
136 - Okay, we're leaving, love you, bye!\\
137 - Boy, do I love restrictions.\\
138 - Hey.\\
139 - Where is everybody?\\
140 - Oh, we're the first ones here.\\
141 - Oh.\\
142 - Cool.\\
143 - Yeah.\\
144 - Cool.\\
145 - (mellow jazz music playing)\\
146 - You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.\\
147 - Oh, I do. It was three years ago.\\
148 - Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often.\\
149 - (chuckles): And-and here we are.\\
150 - So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.\\
151 - I know. What are they gonna talk about?\\
152 - (laughs)\\
153 - I don't know. I really don't know.\\
154 - Hey.\\
155 - Oh, good! Oh, thank God!\\
156 - You guys been here long?\\
157 - No, two minutes.\\
158 - But yes.\\
159 - Where's Claire?\\
160 - Oh, she's meeting us here.\\
161 - Hey, guys, do me a favor and don't ask too many questions about the relationship.\\
162 - We're just keeping it casual.\\
163 - Oh, so I shouldn't ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?\\
164 - Yeah, I know you're teasing, but watch out for karma.\\
165 - Hey, Penny, isn't that your old boyfriend Zack?\\
166 - Oh, yeah.\\
167 - Are you gonna say hi to him?\\
168 - Uh, I don't know.\\
169 - Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed: big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard?\\
170 - Neener neener.\\
171 - I brought sparkling cider.\\
172 - Oh... the bubbles tickle my nose.\\
173 - I'll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.\\
174 - So what do you want to do tonight?\\
175 - Oh, I have quite the evening planned.\\
176 - Our fetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we'll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.\\
177 - There's more than one?\\
178 - You've heard of French toast?\\
179 - Yeah.\\
180 - Cinnamon toast?\\
181 - Yeah.\\
182 - Melba toast?\\
183 - Yeah.\\
184 - You get where I'm going here?\\
185 - Yeah.\\
186 - I'm getting an earthy note.\\
187 - Ah, there's definitely some oak.\\
188 - Also, uh, cherries?\\
189 - I smell nothing.\\
190 - Really? Nothing?\\
191 - Just a... whole lot of Afrin.\\
192 - Penny?\\
193 - Oh. Zack, hi!\\
194 - You guys remember Zack.\\
195 - Yeah, hey, buddy.\\
196 - Hello.\\
197 - Hey.\\
198 - Hey, did you two get married?\\
199 - We did.\\
200 - Yeah, mm-hmm.\\
201 - To each other?\\
202 - Yes. (chuckles)\\
203 - Cool. 'Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.\\
204 - Thanks.\\
205 - So how's the science world?\\
206 - What are you guys up to?\\
207 - W-We've actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.\\
208 - But we won't bore you with the details.\\
209 - Are you kidding? I love science.\\
210 - Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.\\
211 - Mike deGrasse Tyson?\\
212 - Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a mustache and became a scientist.\\
213 - So what's your invention?\\
214 - Well, we're using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.\\
215 - What's neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.\\
216 - Angular momentum.\\
217 - I was wondering about that.\\
218 - You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it'll run forever.\\
219 - Cool.\\
220 - Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?\\
221 - Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.\\
222 - And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.\\
223 - Is it better than the one they use now?\\
224 - A lot! Way better.\\
225 - Huh.\\
226 - You sure you guys are smart?\\
227 - “H-O” gauge trains are 1/87 scale.\\
228 - “N” gauge are 1/160 scale. And that brings us to “Z” gauge, at a “you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know,” 1/220.\\
229 - I'm sorry, I have to ask.\\
230 - When I was five, I ingested a “Z” gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, “I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.”\\
231 - What is it about trains that you like so much?\\
232 - What an interesting question.\\
233 - When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order.\\
234 - I could line them up, categorize them, control them.\\
235 - I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.\\
236 - That's lovely, Sheldon.\\
237 - Well... other than when they're chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.\\
238 - I have to admit, I've been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.\\
239 - Me, too.\\
240 - Why didn't you say something?\\
241 - Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer.\\
242 - It's not a pleasant topic.\\
243 - You can't let this stop you.\\
244 - Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.\\
245 - It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.\\
246 - E equals MC squared.\\
247 - Yeah.\\
248 - “E” is for energy, “M” for mass, and “C” for the speed of light.\\
249 - (clicks tongue)\\
250 - How do you know that?\\
251 - Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants s*x to last longer.\\
252 - Hey, Raj.\\
253 - Hey, Claire.\\
254 - Good, you're here.\\
255 - Guys, this is my friend Claire. We're casually dating, and there's no need for any further questions about it.\\
256 - Would you like a glass of wine?\\
257 - I said no questions!\\
258 - Sheldon: And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because... it has a light side and a dark side.\\
259 - All righty, it's time for Dungeons & Dragons!\\
260 - Dungeons & Dragons.\\
261 - That sounds about right.\\
262 - You're gonna enjoy this.\\
263 - I designed it especially for you.\\
264 - Okay, but just for a little bit.\\
265 - Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.\\
266 - All right.\\
267 - Ready?\\
268 - You bet.\\
269 - Your name is Bernatrix.\\
270 - You are a warrior queen.\\
271 - You're strong, beautiful and tall.\\
272 - Oh. I like the idea of being tall.\\
273 - I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store.\\
274 - For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.\\
275 - This is getting fun. What's next?\\
276 - You're parched and weary from battle.\\
277 - You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.\\
278 - Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.\\
279 - What do you do?\\
280 - I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, “Barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin!”\\
281 - He wants to see I.D.\\
282 - So, Claire, we've heard so many wonderful things about you.\\
283 - Really? Like what?\\
284 - Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.\\
285 - Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.\\
286 - Zack, this is my friend Claire.\\
287 - You're hot. You seeing anybody?\\
288 - Uh, she's seeing me.\\
289 - Why'd you say she's your friend?\\
290 - We're just keeping it casual.\\
291 - Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.\\
292 - I don't know. Ask him.\\
293 - Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.\\
294 - Maybe we should take a step back.\\
295 - Take a step back?\\
296 - I'm not a young man anymore.\\
297 - No, I mean reevaluate what we're doing with the guidance system.\\
298 - But (chuckles) I got a baby on the way.\\
299 - I got to make some money.\\
300 - What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?\\
301 - Okay, let me stop you right there.\\
302 - We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.\\
303 - How?\\
304 - Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.\\
305 - Very funny.\\
306 - You got something better?\\
307 - Well, not really.\\
308 - Okay, then.\\
309 - (toilet flushes)\\
310 - Geez, how much wine did you drink?\\
311 - Not a lot. I just couldn't start until you walked away.\\
312 - The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring!\\
313 - (die clinks)\\
314 - You block it with your shield.\\
315 - Do you attack?\\
316 - Does it have eyes?\\
317 - Three giant red ones and they never blink.\\
318 - It's unsettling.\\
319 - I stab it in the middle eye!\\
320 - (die clinks)\\
321 - Good choice!\\
322 - Critical hit! Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain.\\
323 - With its final dying gasp, it says, (high-pitched voice): “You have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It's low sodium.” (groans)\\
324 - Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.\\
325 - Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner.\\
326 - You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints.\\
327 - As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you've had and notice that your... (die clinks) ...feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been.\\
328 - The end.\\
329 - Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.\\
330 - Oh, the fun doesn't stop.\\
331 - You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.\\
332 - Thank you for this.\\
333 - You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette.\\
334 - It was nice to take a little break tonight.\\
335 - I can understand that.\\
336 - From the moment people realized I was a genius, I've been Sheldon the Genius.\\
337 - Although I've never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don't understand.\\
338 - Which is ironic 'cause, you know, genius.\\
339 - (chuckles)\\
340 - Well, thanks again.\\
341 - You're welcome.\\
342 - And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.\\
343 - I might just take you up on that.\\
344 - Well, mind you now, that offer's only good until the third trimester.\\
345 - I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.\\
346 - Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.\\
347 - What are you talking about?\\
348 - (scoffs) I mean, come on, look at you.\\
349 - You're classically handsome, you've got a swimmer's body.\\
350 - Next to you, I look like me.\\
351 - Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that.\\
352 - But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body.\\
353 - Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.\\
354 - Yeah, okay, just... do me a favor and stop talking about how great Claire is.\\
355 - Anything for you, my little foreign friend.\\
356 - So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?\\
357 - Uh, you know, I-I'm not really around that much.\\
358 - Amy knows much more than I do.\\
359 - I don't think you have anything to worry about.\\
360 - Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.\\
361 - Yeah. He still has an AOL address.\\
362 - I see what you're saying.\\
363 - She's not so great.\\
364 - Don't listen to him.\\
365 - He says crazy things all the time.\\
366 - Uh, watch. Marco.\\
367 - Polo!\\
368 - So, uh, what are you guys talking about?\\
369 - Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.\\
370 - Why would you do that?\\
371 - I specifically asked you not to do that.\\
372 - We didn't.\\
373 - You just did.\\
374 - Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.\\
375 - Morning.\\
376 - Morning.\\
377 - Ugh. Too much wine.\\
378 - Oh, I overdid it myself last night.\\
379 - Hair of the dog.\\
380 - Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?\\
381 - Of course.\\
382 - Does it bother you?\\
383 - No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and... they really helped put things into perspective.\\
384 - Who are these people?\\
385 - Leonard, friends are like toilet paper.\\
386 - It's good to have extras under the sink.

12 - Oh.\\
13 - Oh, that's a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, “Venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?”\\
14 - What are you guys doing?\\
15 - Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.\\

18 - Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.\\
19 - I'm sorry, who is Mike Drop?\\
20 - (chuckles)\\
21 - Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?\\
22 - Sure.\\
23 - Thanks.\\
24 - No problem.\\
25 - Hey, Penny, um, since you're already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?\\
26 - Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?\\
27 - Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.\\
28 - She can cover it in a car ride?\\
29 - I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.\\
30 - You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?\\
31 - Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.\\
32 - Or a way for you to avoid her?\\
33 - I don't know what he's putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.\\
34 - Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.\\
35 - Seriously?\\
36 - Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.\\
37 - That is very mature of you, so I'm gonna go ahead and say, “Suckah.”\\
38 - All right, back to learning.\\
39 - Okay.\\
40 - (clears throat)\\
41 - Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.\\

43 - “Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.”\\
44 - Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!\\
45 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
46 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\

57 - Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening?\\
58 - Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.\\
59 - Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie... and a whole lot of answers.\\
60 - When's the screening?\\
61 - Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.\\
62 - Let's do it. (chuckles)\\
63 - Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.\\
64 - Oh, bad news.\\
65 - Amy's making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.\\
66 - You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you?\\
67 - In fact, that's usually the trick to it.\\
68 - What time do we need to get there?\\
69 - Uh, I'd say by 3:00.\\
70 - You're really going without me?\\
71 - It's not a big deal.\\
72 - Go shopping with Amy, and we'll save a spot in line for you.\\
73 - You don't have the authority to save places in the line.\\
74 - If I do that, I'll be cutting.\\
75 - People do it all the time.\\
76 - You know the golden rule of line etiquette: “No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.”\\
77 - If you really care that much, there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.\\
78 - People are actually waiting in lines as a job?\\
79 - Boy, makes me feel better about my life.\\
80 - Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.\\
81 - And now I feel worse again.\\
82 - I'm not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up.\\
83 - He's battled intimacy issues his whole life.\\
84 - Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?\\
85 - Wow. (clears throat)\\
86 - Didn't even make it out of the parking lot.\\
87 - Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard.\\
88 - Let's talk about you.\\
89 - What would you like to do while you're here?\\
90 - Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.\\
91 - You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.\\
92 - Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favorite books and work our way up to my husband's s*x organs.\\
93 - Very well.\\
94 - What's the last book you read?\\
95 - Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?\\
96 - Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person.\\
97 - So what can I do to make this process easier for you?\\
98 - Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?\\
99 - And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?\\
100 - Uncomfortable.\\
101 - That was a joke, dear.\\
102 - Oh. Sorry.\\
103 - (chuckles) Didn't know you made those.\\
104 - Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law-daughter-in-law dinner tonight?\\
105 - So just the two of us?\\
106 - Or I invite a few girlfriends, 'cause hearing you say “the two of us” just sent a chill right down my spine.\\
107 - (car door opens)\\
108 - Hey.\\
109 - What are you doing here?\\
110 - You're not Sheldon.\\
111 - I thought that might come up.\\
112 - Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.\\
113 - Hold on.\\
114 - He paid you to get out of spending time with me?\\
115 - No, it's not like that.\\
116 - There's a long line he'd rather stand in.\\
117 - So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear?\\
118 - I get paid either way.\\
119 - We're not going shopping together.\\
120 - You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag.\\
121 - And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.\\
122 - Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?\\
123 - (chuckles) Look, lady, I just work here.\\
124 - We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?\\
125 - Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?\\
126 - Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.\\
127 - Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.\\
128 - Sheldon: Stuart, what are you doing here?\\
129 - Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life!\\
130 - Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?!\\
131 - I don't understand.\\
132 - You were happy to do this when I hired you.\\
133 - Why-why are you upset with me now?\\
134 - Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.\\
135 - Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.\\
136 - You're darn right it's fair play, you selfish jerk!\\
137 - You know, just when I think we're making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.\\
138 - I mean, if he didn't want to go shopping with me, why didn't he just say so?\\
139 - Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.\\
140 - I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.\\
141 - Oh, it's all right, dear.\\
142 - Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind.\\
143 - It's understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.\\
144 - I called him “babe” once.\\
145 - He asked me to get a drug test.\\
146 - Well, I do admire your resolve.\\
147 - You're an extraordinary woman.\\
148 - Thank you.\\
149 - You know, she's my mother-in-law.\\
150 - Why can't I bond with her like that?\\
151 - Amy's with Sheldon who she loves like a son.\\
152 - You're with her son... who she doesn't.\\
153 - Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?\\
154 - Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.\\
155 - Three minutes.\\
156 - And he used a kitchen timer.\\
157 - I felt like a soft-boiled egg.\\
158 - You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.\\
159 - Yes.\\
160 - Well, what can you do?\\
161 - (knocking on door)\\
162 - Maybe it's Sheldon, here to say he's sorry.\\
163 - Sheldon says he's sorry.\\
164 - Bernadette, I'll give you five dollars to slam the door.\\
165 - I would have done it for three.\\
166 - Boy, all this standing's making me tired.\\
167 - Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.\\
168 - Not the stick chair.\\
169 - You look like an idiot on that thing.\\
170 - Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.\\
171 - Hey.\\
172 - Hey.\\
173 - Is everything smoothed out with Amy?\\
174 - Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.\\
175 - Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?\\
176 - I said, “Sheldon says he's sorry.”\\
177 - Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.\\
178 - You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?\\
179 - (sighs) I suppose so.\\
180 - But if I get out of the line, I'll lose my spot.\\
181 - I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.\\
182 - You would do that?\\
183 - Consider it my way of getting more of your money.\\
184 - You're a good man.\\
185 - So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?\\
186 - Oh, I didn't realize you two work together.\\
187 - Well, we don't exactly.\\
188 - I'm a microbiologist for the research team.\\
189 - Oh, what are you currently developing?\\
190 - Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.\\
191 - That's interesting.\\
192 - I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.\\
193 - Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski?\\
194 - I just saw his TED Talk!\\
195 - Beverly: It was.\\
196 - Let's get back to Penny.\\
197 - Hey, weren't you telling me something great about your company car?\\
198 - Um...\\
199 - (clears her throat)\\
200 - It has seat warmers.\\
201 - (knocking at door)\\
202 - Sheldon: Amy! Amy! Amy!\\
203 - Come in.\\
204 - Hello, everyone.\\
205 - Oh, Beverly, good to see you!\\
206 - I'd love to chat, but there's a line that could start moving any minute, so let's do this.\\
207 - Amy?\\
208 - A proper apology requires three steps.\\
209 - Step one-- an admission of wrongdoing.\\
210 - Amy, I was wrong.\\
211 - Step two-- a promise never to repeat said action.\\
212 - Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that's a promise.\\
213 - Step three-- an earnest request for forgiveness.\\
214 - Amy, I hope you can forgive me.\\
215 - And I hope you do it right now, 'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.\\
216 - Fine.\\
217 - Oh, thanks! You're a peach!\\
218 - Beverly, we'll catch up soon.\\
219 - Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.\\
220 - (door closes)\\
221 - How long have I had spinach in my teeth?\\
222 - Since the airport, dear.\\
223 - You look like you come with a kickstand.\\
224 - You can't make me feel bad.\\
225 - Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?\\
226 - So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?\\
227 - I'm back.\\
228 - Hey, how'd it go?\\
229 - It went well.\\
230 - Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels.\\
231 - Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.\\
232 - Anyone else need anything before I go?\\
233 - I'll give you a dollar if make fun of Raj.\\
234 - That's mean.\\
235 - Five.\\
236 - You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.\\
237 - Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.\\
238 - Hey, guys.\\
239 - Woman: You made it.\\
240 - Did you see that?\\
241 - He just cut the line.\\
242 - He's just joining his friends; it's fine.\\
243 - (stammers) No, it's not fine.\\
244 - It is a breach of line etiquette.\\
245 - We're near the front of the line.\\
246 - We'll get in either way.\\
247 - What if every person in front of us lets someone cut?\\
248 - We'd still get in.\\
249 - What if each of those people let someone cut?\\
250 - Still get in.\\
251 - But then each of those people let someone cut?\\
252 - We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you over the head with his stick chair.\\
253 - Excuse me.\\
254 - Oh, please don't.\\
255 - Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice that you cut the line.\\
256 - Oh, uh, I'm with my friends.\\
257 - It's cool.\\
258 - Well, no.\\
259 - It's not cool.\\
260 - If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine.\\
261 - But this line is first-come, first-served.\\
262 - Not “show up tardy and nevertheless be first served”.\\
263 - Right here.\\
264 - No.\\
265 - You need to go to the back of the line.\\
266 - (scoffs) Uh, who made you line monitor?\\
267 - Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.\\
268 - And my slogan was “a line that's straight is a line that's great”\\
269 - Is this guy for real?\\
270 - Boy, I wish I could say no.\\
271 - That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.\\
272 - Well, he's come a long way.\\
273 - Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.\\
274 - Your relationship with him is fascinating.\\
275 - I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.\\
276 - Oh, sure.\\
277 - I'll-I'll talk to Sheldon about it.\\
278 - You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.\\
279 - Really?\\
280 - Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?\\
281 - Do I think he'd be interested?\\
282 - Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he's alone in the bathroom.\\
283 - Wonderful!\\
284 - I'll give you my contact information.\\
285 - Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.\\
286 - About what?\\
287 - Okay, you know what?\\
288 - This is ridiculous.\\
289 - I've been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I'm getting nowhere.\\
290 - Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?\\
291 - What I was seeking was some sort of friendship.\\
292 - But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.\\
293 - My intention was never to insult you.\\
294 - You've been doing it all day!\\
295 - Do you even know what an insult is?!\\
296 - Well, it's not a clinical term.\\
297 - But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.\\
298 - Okay, good example.\\
299 - What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?!\\
300 - The Avengers are rule-breakers!\\
301 - Being vengeful is in their job description!\\
302 - They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government!\\
303 - Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?\\
304 - As a matter of fact I do.\\
305 - At a little place called the DMV.\\
306 - He's got him there.\\
307 - The D even stands for department.\\
308 - Excuse me!\\
309 - Excuse me, can I please see a show of hands?\\
310 - Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?\\
311 - Told you.\\
312 - Well, what a sad state of affairs!\\
313 - That you've all been so ground down by life, you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.\\
314 - I can't believe we're gonna get beat up, and it's not because of your chair.\\
315 - You know, right now, at the back of this line, there's a movie fan like you who's not going to get in, because this person simply doesn't care.\\
316 - Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.\\
317 - Okay, you may have to pretend you're black to get us out of here.\\
318 - Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps, and stand up for ourselves!\\
319 - And-and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not that time to enjoy the irony of that.\\
320 - Now, I ask you again.\\
321 - Who here takes issue with this person--?\\
322 - Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.\\
323 - I most certainly did not.\\
324 - I saw you.\\
325 - If you're feeling dizzy, it's because the tables have turned.\\
326 - Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was “swapsies”, not “cutsies”.\\
327 - Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!\\
328 - I ask you all again. A show of hands.\\
329 - Who here takes issue--?\\
330 - Well, stop moving!\\
331 - He's gonna get in!\\
332 - Buddy, let it go.\\
333 - No, I can't.\\
334 - This isn't right.\\
335 - You did everything you could.\\
336 - No, I could've done more.\\
337 - Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer.\\
338 - That's all anyone could ask.\\
339 - To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.\\
340 - I'm still human, Penny.\\
341 - Not getting invited to my own son's wedding is difficult to ignore.\\
342 - Amy: I know how you feel.\\
343 - She didn't invite any of us.\\
344 - It was spur of the moment!\\
345 - But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.\\
346 - I could've watched it on the Internet?\\
347 - Thank you.\\
348 - So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?\\
349 - No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake.\\
350 - But an invitation would've been nice.\\
351 - You really think we made a mistake?\\
352 - At the time I did.\\
353 - But I-I've never seen Leonard so happy, so... perhaps I was wrong.\\
354 - Wow.\\
355 - Okay.\\
356 - Well, um, how about this?\\
357 - Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony.\\
358 - You know, if you're interested.\\
359 - I would find that perfectly acceptable.\\
360 - (gasps) She would find it perfectly acceptable!\\
361 - You guys saw it! We bonded!\\
362 - Howie?\\
363 - You doing okay? You've been in there a while.\\
364 - Wolowitz: (stammers) I'm fine. Be right out.\\
365 - Am I an American hero? (chuckles)\\
366 - Well, that's a good question, Jim.\\
367 - Don't you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he's a hero to all the nations of the Earth?\\
368 - (toilet flushes)\\
369 - Okey dokey.\\
370 - I think I have time for one more question.
\subsection {Episode 24: The Convergence Convergence}
1 - Hey.\\
2 - Hi, how was the screening?\\
3 - Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.\\
4 - Ugh, I should've never bought him that coloring book that explains Black History Month.\\
5 - How'd it go with my mother?\\
6 - Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.\\
7 - Wow.\\
8 - Well done. (chuckles)\\
9 - Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.\\
10 - Did she think you were choking or...\\
11 - I'm sorry, that's great.\\
12 - Thank you for spending time with her.\\
13 - No problem.\\
14 - Um, so listen, I don't know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we'd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.\\
15 - Wait, we're gonna get married again?\\
16 - Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.\\
17 - Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.\\
18 - Come on, it'll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn't invite her to the first one.\\
19 - Look, in our defense, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don't like her.\\
20 - Leonard, come on, she's your mom.\\
21 - If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn't we?\\
22 - I just said why-- we don't like her.\\
23 - Hey, look, then forget about her, let's do it for us.\\
24 - We could keep it small and informal.\\
25 - This time we can invite our families.\\
26 - Is your brother out of prison?\\
27 - Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.\\
28 - I'd love it if my dad could come.\\
29 - Oh, you have to invite him.\\
30 - I haven't seen him since the divorce.\\
31 - Oh, he's like a different man.\\
32 - Oh. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.\\
33 - Well, then it's settled.\\
34 - Yay.\\
35 - God.\\
36 - So funny.\\
37 - I never thought my second marriage would be to you!\\
38 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
39 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
40 -  The Earth began to cool \\
41 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
42 -  We built the Wall \\
43 -  We built the pyramids \\
44 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
45 -  That all started with a big bang \\
46 -  Bang! \\

50 - Original air date on May 12, 2016\\
51 - Okay, so it's not a legal ceremony, it's just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.\\
52 - So there's no maid of honor?\\
53 - No.\\
54 - Huh.\\
55 - But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?\\
56 - I don't see how I could.\\
57 - (chuckles)\\
58 - Then I graciously accept.\\
59 - Who's going to officiate?\\
60 - I was kind of hoping you would.\\
61 - Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honor?\\
62 - Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother.\\
63 - She is coming to the wedding.\\
64 - Okay, wait, you're inviting people to our wedding?\\
65 - Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding.\\
66 - Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr.\\
67 - And now, don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.\\
68 - Who's Erno Rubik?\\
69 - Seriously?\\
70 - He invented the Rubik's Cube.\\
71 - Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?\\
72 - Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.\\
73 - Well, it's very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard's mother.\\
74 - Yeah, I'm also doing it for Leonard.\\
75 - I think this could really help their relationship.\\
76 - How dare you invite your father without consulting me!\\
77 - Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.\\
78 - You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.\\
79 - I know, and there's no excuse for that.\\
80 - He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.\\
81 - I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.\\
82 - Oh, my God.\\
83 - It's working.\\
84 - You sure?\\
85 - Look.\\
86 - The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.\\
87 - (inhales)\\
88 - You're right.\\
89 - You realize what this means?\\
90 - Yeah.\\
91 - I do.\\
92 - It's proof of concept.\\
93 - We've got a workable guidance system.\\
94 - Congratulations.\\
95 - Thanks! (chuckles)\\
96 - (computer chimes)\\
97 - Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.\\
98 - Open it.\\
99 - Hmm.\\
100 - "We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118."\\
101 - That's weird.\\
102 - Is there a window around here we don't know about?\\
103 - I'm sure it's just a coincidence.\\
104 - Yeah, of course.\\
105 - What else could it be?\\
106 - (raised voice): Boy, do I love America.\\
107 - Thank you for picking me up.\\
108 - Oh, you're welcome.\\
109 - I was speaking to your young lady.\\
110 - My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.\\
111 - Oh, please call me Mary.\\
112 - Okay, Mary.\\
113 - You know, that doesn't work for me, let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.\\
114 - Sheldon, don't be silly.\\
115 - Wait, what?\\
116 - That's what I called you till I got to know you better.\\
117 - It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.\\
118 - Well, actually, I... It sure was.\\
119 - I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard.\\
120 - Taking care of my baby all these years.\\
121 - Excuse me, I take care of him.\\
122 - Sure you do.\\
123 - So who else is coming to this shindig?\\
124 - Oh, well, the usual gang.\\
125 - Penny's family is coming tomorrow.\\
126 - Yeah, and Leonard's mother's already here.\\
127 - Oh, Beverly.\\
128 - How nice.\\
129 - You've met her, right?\\
130 - Yes, I have.\\
131 - Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.\\
132 - Either way, let's stop and get some garlic.\\
133 - So, Mary, how have you been?\\
134 - Well, thank you so much for asking.\\
135 - I've been well, and you?\\
136 - Very good.\\
137 - Good.\\
138 - I don't know what we were worried about; they're getting along great.\\
139 - Sheldon tells me your husband's coming.\\
140 - My ex-husband.\\
141 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
142 - Don't be.\\
143 - All right.\\
144 - Whew, chilly.\\
145 - I think I can see my breath.\\
146 - We can hear you.\\
147 - Sorry. Sorry.\\
148 - I can't believe I was so naive.\\
149 - The military is just gonna take over the whole project.\\
150 - And you know what happens if we object?\\
151 - We disappear.\\
152 - (nervous chuckle)\\
153 - Like off the map.\\
154 - Like every American Idol winner since season four.\\
155 - Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.\\
156 - Am I?\\
157 - (whispers): Am I?\\
158 - Wha-- what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I'm no longer in it?\\
159 - That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.\\
160 - Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions.\\
161 - So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.\\
162 - Oh, please, that's not how it works.\\
163 - You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World.\\
164 - The military just shows up and takes over.\\
165 - You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?\\
166 - (chuckles)\\
167 - I'm sorry, you find this funny?\\
168 - No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World.\\
169 - Boy, that was terrible.\\
170 - Oh, we have to use the stairs.\\
171 - When are they gonna fix your elevator?\\
172 - Uh... I don't-- any day now.\\
173 - Well, the stairs are fine.\\
174 - Besides, your mother is up there.\\
175 - Maybe I'll have a heart attack and not have to see her.\\
176 - Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I'm really glad you're here.\\
177 - Me, too. (chuckles)\\
178 - I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.\\
179 - Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.\\
180 - Ah, she's a sweetie.\\
181 - You got a good one there, Leonard.\\
182 - Thanks, Dad.\\
183 - How the hell did you do that?\\
184 - (celery crunches loudly)\\
185 - (loud crunching)\\
186 - Isn't this nice?\\
187 - (door opens)\\
188 - Hey, we're here.\\
189 - Alfred!\\
190 - Thank you for coming!\\
191 - Oh.\\
192 - Well, happy to be here.\\
193 - And congratulations.\\
194 - Thank you.\\
195 - Dad, you remember Sheldon.\\
196 - Dr. Hofstadter.\\
197 - Dr. Cooper.\\
198 - This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.\\
199 - How do you do?\\
200 - Nice to meet you.\\
201 - And his girlfriend, Amy.\\
202 - A pleasure.\\
203 - Hi.\\
204 - And, of course, Mom.\\
205 - Hello, my hateful shrew.\\
206 - Hello to you, you wrinkled old b*st*rd.\\
207 - All right, now I'm starting to sense a little tension.\\
208 - All right, you two, don't start.\\
209 - Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit.\\
210 - Can you please not ruin it?\\
211 - Of course. I'm sorry.\\
212 - Oh, look at that-- you can apologize.\\
213 - Mom!\\
214 - I'm sorry.\\
215 - You know, the Bible says forgiveness...\\
216 - Mom!\\
217 - I'm sorry.\\
218 - Uh, who's hungry?\\
219 - We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.\\
220 - It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.\\
221 - Sheldon!\\
222 - I'm not sorry. That's true.\\
223 - I don't know what to do.\\
224 - It's the Air Force.\\
225 - I mean, should I respond to their e-mail?\\
226 - Ignore it?\\
227 - You can't ignore it.\\
228 - It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.\\
229 - Guys, come on.\\
230 - We're meeting everyone for dinner.\\
231 - One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.\\
232 - Oh, dude.\\
233 - The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it.\\
234 - I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now.\\
235 - Oh, damn.\\
236 - I love America.\\
237 - Are you done with this nonsense?\\
238 - It's not nonsense.\\
239 - This is how the U.S. military works.\\
240 - Oh, if it's even the U.S. military.\\
241 - It could be foreign military pretending to be American.\\
242 - You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they're using it against us.\\
243 - I also love the enemies of America.\\
244 - Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard's father doesn't discourage you from the commitment you've made to one another.\\
245 - Oh, of course not.\\
246 - Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.\\
247 - Mom, please save something for the toast.\\
248 - So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?\\
249 - Oh, I'm an anthropologist.\\
250 - I study ancient peoples and cultures.\\
251 - My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.\\
252 - (laughing)\\
253 - Don't laugh-- she wasn't joking.\\
254 - Play with your phone.\\
255 - Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.\\
256 - I don't have a mythology.\\
257 - I have the unerring Word of God.\\
258 - But that's very interesting.\\
259 - Oh.\\
260 - I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith.\\
261 - Actually, I admire it.\\
262 - Really?\\
263 - Yes.\\
264 - Yes, I'm an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.\\
265 - Well, He came close.\\
266 - Turned her into a giant block of ice.\\
267 - (both laughing)\\
268 - Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.\\
269 - Are you kidding?\\
270 - They're probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.\\
271 - What about the guy on the Channel Four News?\\
272 - You know, "Four on Your Side"?\\
273 - Maybe he can be on your side.\\
274 - I'm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.\\
275 - Oh, stop!\\
276 - You know what's really happening?\\
277 - All the movies you've watched, the TV shows, the comic books-- they've completely twisted your thinking.\\
278 - No one's after you, no one's listening to you, no one cares about you.\\
279 - I'd like to think the "Four on Your Side" guy cares about me.\\
280 - You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn't married him, there'd be no Leonard.\\
281 - (chuckles)\\
282 - So that's good, right?\\
283 - Eh.\\
284 - Is that Howard in front of us?\\
285 - Oh, maybe.\\
286 - Get closer.\\
287 - Oh, God.\\
288 - I think someone's following us.\\
289 - You're being ridiculous.\\
290 - I'm not being ridiculous-- he's right on my tail.\\
291 - Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.\\
292 - Well, why is he turning here?\\
293 - The restaurant's the other way.\\
294 - I don't know.\\
295 - He uses that traffic app. Maybe there's an accident.\\
296 - Oh, so follow him.\\
297 - Oh, no!\\
298 - I told you!\\
299 - It's probably just a coincidence.\\
300 - Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.\\
301 - Well, go faster.\\
302 - You're losing him.\\
303 - What is his hurry?\\
304 - You know what, flash your lights.\\
305 - Let him know it's you.\\
306 - He's flashing his lights.\\
307 - What's that mean?\\
308 - I-I think he wants us to pull over.\\
309 - Do not pull over!\\
310 - I'm not raising this baby alone!\\
311 - Hang on!\\
312 - (engine revving)\\
313 - So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?\\
314 - No, just focused on work and the church.\\
315 - Ah. And what do you do?\\
316 - I work at the church.\\
317 - Well, they're lucky to have you.\\
318 - Mary: Well, thank you.\\
319 - You're welcome.\\
320 - Do you realize what's happening here?\\
321 - Yeah, I do.\\
322 - They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.\\
323 - Hey.\\
324 - Amy: Hey.\\
325 - What took you guys so long?\\
326 - Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.\\
327 - So, what did we miss?\\
328 - Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.\\
329 - Leonard, your father is just charming.\\
330 - He's also broke.\\
331 - Did he mention that?\\
332 - Okay, Mom, you sit over there...\\
333 - And I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.\\
334 - If I'd known you were broke, I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread.\\
335 - Hey, Penny.\\
336 - What are you talking about?\\
337 - Oh, that was you?\\
338 - (chuckles)\\
339 - Long story.\\
340 - Why don't you go ahead and eat.\\
341 - We're gonna be a while.\\
342 - I'm telling you, I'm not on drugs.\\
343 - The government's out to get me!\\
344 - Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens frequently mated with each other.\\
345 - Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon's father.\\
346 - (laughs)\\
347 - That's funny, because my father was not a very clever man.\\
348 - I'd be lost without you.\\
349 - (utensil clinking on glass)\\
350 - Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.\\
351 - See, that's funny because...\\
352 - Back to your phone.\\
353 - Penny...\\
354 - I've always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you.\\
355 - Thank you for saying yes.\\
356 - Oh, thanks for asking until I did.\\
357 - Hear, hear.\\
358 - Cheers.\\
359 - I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.\\
360 - Aw.\\
361 - (chuckles) Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.\\
362 - What the hell is that supposed to mean?\\
363 - Why don't you take a pill?\\
364 - Like you did before s*x?\\
365 - What I really needed was a blindfold.\\
366 - All right, everyone... calm down.\\
367 - Let's all remember what it says in the Bible:\\
368 - "He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty."\\
369 - Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?\\
370 - When God writes one, I will.\\
371 - (clears throat)\\
372 - Um, if-if we want to order the soufflé, we might want to get on that.\\
373 - Leonard, if you don't mind, I-I think I'm a little tired.\\
374 - I'm gonna call it a night.\\
375 - Sure, Dad.\\
376 - I'm a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.\\
377 - Would you like to share a cab?\\
378 - That would be fine.\\
379 - Where are you staying?\\
380 - I'm at the Westin.\\
381 - Oh, so am I.\\
382 - Can I interest you in a nightcap?\\
383 - I think that you could.\\
384 - What is happening there?\\
385 - I think it's pretty obvious.\\
386 - They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.\\
387 - She's still not answering.\\
388 - My father's not texting me back.\\
389 - (singsongy): 'Cause they both turned their phones off.\\
390 - I don't like this at all.\\
391 - I don't like it either.\\
392 - Really?\\
393 - (laughing): 'Cause I love it.

3 - How do you do?\\
4 - Nice to meet you.\\
5 - And, of course, Mom.\\
6 - Hello, my hateful shrew.\\
7 - Hello to you, you wrinkled old b*st*rd.\\
8 - (laptop chimes)\\
9 - Hey.\\
10 - Just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.\\
11 - I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.\\
12 - Dude, the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it.\\
13 - I mean, they're probably looking at you through the camera right now.\\
14 - Oh, God.\\
15 - I think someone's following us.\\
16 - Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.\\

27 - Would you like to share a cab?\\
28 - That would be fine.\\
29 - Where are you staying? I'm at the Westin.\\
30 - Well, so am I.\\
31 - Could I interest you in a nightcap?\\
32 - I think that you could.\\
33 - Sheldon: Leonard?\\
34 - Leonard?\\
35 - What?\\
36 - You realize you and I could become brothers.\\
37 - We're not gonna be brothers.\\
38 - We're not gonna be stepbrothers.\\
39 - Go to sleep.\\
40 - I hope you're right.\\
41 - 'Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother's wife is weird.\\
42 - Go to sleep.\\
43 - Okay.\\
44 - Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things to my mother?\\
45 - No.\\
46 - Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?\\
47 - Your parents are old.\\
48 - Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30.\\
49 - Go to sleep.\\
50 - Very well.\\
51 - I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.\\
52 - God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this...\\
53 - Hey, if you want me to sleep you're gonna have to stop talking.\\
54 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
55 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
56 -  The Earth began to cool \\
57 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
58 -  We built the Wall \\
59 -  We built the pyramids \\

61 -  That all started with a big bang \\

64 - The Conjugal Conjecture\\
65 - Okay, I'm gonna go pick up my family.\\
66 - Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.\\
67 - Yeah, drive safe.\\
68 - Oh, hey, and do yourself a favor, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb.\\
69 - It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.\\
70 - What?\\
71 - Oh.\\
72 - Hi. Okay, hey there, I got--\\
73 - I'm sorry, I got to go now.\\
74 - Penny, wait.\\
75 - Why?\\
76 - I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.\\
77 - Well, why? What's wrong?\\
78 - Wha-- are we still doing the dumb thing?\\
79 - Okay, why, what's wrong?\\
80 - I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.\\
81 - Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?\\
82 - Stop it, Sheldon.\\
83 - Do I say "Stop what?" or just throw in the towel?\\
84 - I don't see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.\\
85 - Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about, however accurately.\\
86 - Penny: Okay, Beverly, aren't you overreacting a little?\\
87 - All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.\\
88 - And turned their phones off.\\
89 - Not helping, buddy.\\
90 - Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this.\\
91 - Please stay.\\
92 - Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.\\
93 - Well, we can't have that.\\
94 - You know, also, if they did have coitus, we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.\\
95 - It is funny when you think about it.\\
96 - Maybe to you.\\
97 - You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.\\
98 - Because you were driving like a lunatic.\\
99 - Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then... yeah, okay.\\
100 - (doorbell rings)\\
101 - Oh, I'll get it.\\
102 - It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.\\
103 - I have performance anxiety.\\
104 - You of all people should know that.\\
105 - (voice cracking): Hello.\\
106 - I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.\\
107 - Howard Wolowitz?\\
108 - I have the right address, don't I?\\
109 - Address?\\
110 - Is he here?\\
111 - Um... no.\\
112 - Do you know where I can find him?\\
113 - May I ask what this is about?\\
114 - No, you may not.\\
115 - Very well.\\
116 - Have him call me.\\
117 - Okay.\\
118 - Wolowitz: Raj, who's at the door?\\
119 - (chuckles)\\
120 - That's not him.\\
121 - Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone.\\
122 - I told them all about you.\\
123 - Like what?\\
124 - Do they know about your brother?\\
125 - Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.\\
126 - Why would you do that?\\
127 - What?\\
128 - The world doesn't need to know our problems.\\
129 - Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but...\\
130 - Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.\\
131 - You really think it's helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?\\
132 - Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.\\
133 - Well, quit it!\\
134 - (clears throat)\\
135 - So, uh, Randall, can't believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.\\
136 - Well, good thing I was a nonviolent offender, otherwise I couldn't have left the state.\\
137 - All right, that's enough jail talk.\\
138 - Penny knows where I was; she sent me cigarettes.\\
139 - You sent your brother cigarettes?\\
140 - He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.\\
141 - Stop trying to be the cool dad; you have a shirt with our cat's picture on it.\\
142 - Anyway, we're here, slugger.\\
143 - That's great, now they know where I live.\\
144 - What are you talking about?\\
145 - They've always known where you live.\\
146 - Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother's house.\\
147 - Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?\\
148 - Yeah.\\
149 - I would not have done that for you.\\
150 - Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.\\
151 - All right, all right.\\
152 - Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren't home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.\\
153 - Yes, hello.\\
154 - (clears throat) Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.\\
155 - Oh, I take it back, don't mention me.\\
156 - Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you?\\
157 - What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India.\\
158 - No, I don't know his immigration status.\\
159 - Relax, I'm still on hold!\\
160 - Speaking.\\
161 - Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday.\\
162 - Caltech is fine.\\
163 - Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?\\
164 - (chuckles)\\
165 - I may not?\\
166 - That's what he said to me.\\
167 - Here you are, Mother.\\
168 - Thank you.\\
169 - I'm glad you decided to stay.\\
170 - It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.\\
171 - I can't wait for this day to be over.\\
172 - Yeah, special, like that.\\
173 - (knocking on door)\\
174 - That's them.\\
175 - Please don't make things any more awkward than they already are.\\
176 - All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.\\
177 - Hey, guys, come on in.\\
178 - Oh, thank you.\\
179 - Good morning.\\
180 - Morning.\\
181 - Hello.\\
182 - How is everyone today?\\
183 - Good, and you?\\
184 - Good, good. Good.\\
185 - I'm good, too.\\
186 - Good.\\
187 - So, did you defile my mother or not?\\
188 - Sheldon!\\
189 - You're being rude.\\
190 - If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.\\
191 - Did that conversation include the phrase "your genitals are a joy to behold"?\\
192 - That's enough!\\
193 - Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.\\
194 - You don't know his girlfriend very well.\\
195 - Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.\\
196 - All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we'll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.\\
197 - You know, It's hard to believe I've never met Leonard.\\
198 - Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.\\
199 - (chuckles)\\
200 - Not funny, Wyatt.\\
201 - I thought it was really funny.\\
202 - Thanks.\\
203 - Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too.\\
204 - Knock, knock.\\
205 - Who's there?\\
206 - Our family is an embarrassment.\\
207 - That's not much of a joke.\\
208 - Penny: Okay.\\
209 - Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.\\
210 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
211 - It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents for the first time, and-and they're academics and-and intellectuals, and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.\\
212 - Well, what color trash do you think they'll believe?\\
213 - How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?\\
214 - A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa.\\
215 - You're kind of a sucker.\\
216 - Well, nothing happened, right?\\
217 - I-It's over.\\
218 - Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.\\
219 - Well, you know, actually that's not the case.\\
220 - Mary may visit me in New York.\\
221 - Mary: Mm-hmm.\\
222 - And he's never been to Texas.\\
223 - Maybe we meet halfway.\\
224 - What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?\\
225 - I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.\\
226 - You're not seriously going to visit each other.\\
227 - And why wouldn't we?\\
228 - Oh please, you're just saying this to antagonize me.\\
229 - Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman.\\
230 - And if it antagonizes you, that's just a bonus.\\
231 - Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.\\
232 - No, no, nothing to be sorry about.\\
233 - I genuinely like your father.\\
234 - What? But he's a mediocre academic.\\
235 - And according to Beverly, his sexual prowess is subpar.\\
236 - He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.\\
237 - Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?\\
238 - Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you.\\
239 - Pretty efficient, huh?\\
240 - (stammers) This is ridiculous. I-I'm going across the hall.\\
241 - But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?\\
242 - Fine, then you go!\\
243 - Well, I don't want to stay here with her. I'll go.\\
244 - I'll go with you.\\
245 - That still leaves me here with him.\\
246 - Hang on, hang on!\\
247 - We're smart, we can figure this out.\\
248 - Okay, so: Mary and Beverly can't be together.\\
249 - Uh, Alfred and Beverly can't be together.\\
250 - Leonard and I can't be together.\\
251 - Now, I could be with Alfred... but I don't like his face.\\
252 - Oh, here! I've got it!\\
253 - Who's ready for a wedding?\\
254 - Great, now I have to start all over.\\
255 - So how's the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?\\
256 - Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.\\
257 - See what happens when you work hard?\\
258 - Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make 'em.\\
259 - Okay, that's enough.\\
260 - No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.\\
261 - I'll drink to that.\\
262 - Haven't you had enough?\\
263 - Penny drinks more than I do.\\
264 - Well, I learned from the best.\\
265 - Aw! Aw!\\
266 - Very nice, Wyatt.\\
267 - And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.\\
268 - You see what I've gotta put up with!\\
269 - What you've gotta put up with?\\
270 - Why did you have to go to jail?\\
271 - It's called getting caught, Mother!\\
272 - Hello!\\
273 - Hey, there he is! Hey!\\
274 - Oh, Leonard! It's so nice to see you again!\\
275 - Oh, you, too!\\
276 - Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverly.\\
277 - Hello.\\
278 - Susan: Hi.\\
279 - We are not white trash!\\
280 - Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?\\
281 - Yes, I am.\\
282 - I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused.\\
283 - Oh, so am I.\\
284 - You made God sad today, Mom.\\
285 - Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong.\\
286 - I think it's nice they're hitting it off.\\
287 - Well, that's still no reason to rush into anything.\\
288 - (stammers) Look at us.\\
289 - We took things remarkably slow.\\
290 - You and I, we didn't even hold hands for two years.\\
291 - It was a lot hotter than it sounds.\\
292 - You're a patient young lady.\\
293 - Hey, hey!\\
294 - She's mine! Take a cold shower, grandpa!\\
295 - Why wouldn't that colonel say what the meeting's about?\\
296 - It has to be bad news.\\
297 - Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.\\
298 - That's really stupid advice.\\
299 - You know that hurts my feelings.\\
300 - Calm down, try not to think about it.\\
301 - Okay.\\
302 - Why do I bother talking to you?\\
303 - Oh, come on. What's the worst that could come of this meeting?\\
304 - I don't know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?\\
305 - Okay, that's not so bad.\\
306 - You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project?\\
307 - The government forced them to move to the desert.\\
308 - They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.\\
309 - What's the point of that story?\\
310 - I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.\\
311 - (laughs)\\
312 - There he is!\\
313 - There's my happy Hebraic homeboy.\\
314 - Yeah, that's the smile I'm gonna remember when you're living in the desert and I'm living with your wife.\\
315 - So, what do you do for a living?\\
316 - Mommy, you want to take this one?\\
317 - Um, Randall's in between jobs.\\
318 - (whispering): And court appearances.\\
319 - It's nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man.\\
320 - I'm looking forward to meeting his father.\\
321 - Prepare to be disappointed.\\
322 - And he can't wait to meet you, too.\\
323 - Can I get anyone a drink?\\
324 - Well, I could use another beer. (laughs)\\
325 - You're done.\\
326 - He's done.\\
327 - Hey! Is everyone getting to know each other?\\
328 - Not at all!\\
329 - (harp music playing)\\
330 - Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter.\\
331 - I'm, uh, Leonard's friend, Stuart.\\
332 - Nice to see you, too.\\
333 - Hi, I'm Stuart.\\
334 - Ooh, I'm Alfred. Leonard's father.\\
335 - Oh! Oh, hi. Uh, I'm sorry, did you two want to sit together?\\
336 - No. No.\\
337 - I was wondering why the front row was available.\\
338 - Okay, I think we're ready.\\
339 - (Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays on harp)\\
340 - Why do people cry at weddings?\\
341 - They're practicing for what's coming later.\\
342 - Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister's wedding.\\
343 - Thank you for my new teeth.\\
344 - Welcome to the family, Leonard.\\
345 - Don't lend your new brother-in-law money.\\
346 - We're here today to celebrate love.\\
347 - (sighs loudly)\\
348 - Sigh louder, no one heard you.\\
349 - Really, I can move.\\
350 - Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.\\
351 - Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.\\
352 - Love is patient, but it's not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let's knock it off!\\
353 - At least she's yelling at someone else for a change.\\
354 - Bernadette: Howard!\\
355 - Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff.\\
356 - Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings.\\
357 - Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time.\\
358 - But also how incredibly happy you make me.\\
359 - Thank you for marrying me.\\
360 - Hopefully for the last time.\\
361 - Penny... as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen.\\
362 - But I don't think I'll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you.\\
363 - You know... maybe... I don't need to understand it, I just need to be grateful.\\
364 - I love you, Penny.\\
365 - Penny: Oh...\\
366 - Anybody have anything snarky to say about that?\\
367 - Didn't think so.\\
368 - I'd like to say something.\\
369 - (clears throat)\\
370 - Beverly, I know that we don't bring out the best in each other.\\
371 - But something wonderful did come from our relationship: that young man right there.\\
372 - I couldn't agree more.\\
373 - (quietly): That's beautiful.\\
374 - Thank you.\\
375 - All right, let's continue.\\
376 - Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and...\\
377 - I just can't wait any longer.\\
378 - It's happening.\\
379 - Leonard...\\
380 - You and I have our ups and downs.\\
381 - But I have always considered you my family.\\
382 - Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits.\\
383 - I don't always show it, but you are of great importance to me.\\
384 - Both of you.\\
385 - Oh...\\
386 - Thank you.\\
387 - Okay.\\
388 - I now pronounce you husband and wife.\\
389 - And weird other husband who came with the apartment.\\
390 - (Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" playing)\\
391 - Thank you for taking us to the airport.\\
392 - Hey, I'm just thrilled we're all getting along for a minute.\\
393 - Yeah, me, too.\\
394 - Beverly, I'm sorry if I upset you.\\
395 - Water under the bridge, Alfred.\\
396 - Leonard, why don't you get into the carpool lane?\\
397 - Well, that's a solid line. He can't cross it.\\
398 - That's okay. I can make it over.\\
399 - No, no, let's plod along.\\
400 - It'll make your father feel more comfortable.\\
401 - What makes me comfortable is knowing I don't have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.\\
402 - Do the world a favor, and don't wake up tomorrow morning.\\
403 - That was almost a minute.\\
404 - There's a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?\\
405 - You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.\\
406 - Good. Thank you.\\
407 - Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.\\
408 - Hey.\\
409 - I will not have you be disrespectful to me.\\
410 - Yes ma'am.\\
411 - Sheldon, you're mother's an attractive woman.\\
412 - You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interest in her.\\
413 - Well.. and you need to drive the car and mind your business.\\
414 - I will not have you be disrespectful to me.\\
415 - What-- you're not my mother.\\
416 - Don't you be disrespectful to her.\\
417 - Yes ma'am.\\
418 - You'll get there.\\
419 - You've just gotta put some zing on it.\\
420 - Penny, I don't know what I was worried about.\\
421 - You're friends are just lovely.\\
422 - Oh, thanks, Mom.\\
423 - Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.\\
424 - Is he? I never noticed.\\
425 - He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.\\
426 - (laughter)\\
427 - Cops, cops, be cool!
\subsection {Episode 02: The Military Miniaturization}
1 - Previously, on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Hello.\\
3 - I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.\\
4 - May I ask what this is about?\\
5 - No, you may not.\\
6 - Very well.\\
7 - Hi... Colonel Williams.\\
8 - How can I help you?\\
9 - O-Okay.\\
10 - Sure, I can meet with you on Thursday.\\
11 - Caltech is fine.\\
12 - Yeah, may I ask what this is about?\\
13 - (brief chuckle)\\
14 - I may not?\\
15 - That's what he said to me.\\
16 - Look at this.\\
17 - Elon Musk has a theory that we're all just characters in some advanced civilization's video game.\\
18 - So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?\\
19 - Well, he doesn't say it's a good game.\\
20 - All right, we got a problem.\\
21 - What's up?\\
22 - The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope.\\
23 - They want to have a meeting.\\
24 - Really?\\
25 - Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door.\\
26 - He was terrifying.\\
27 - Oh, what did he say?\\
28 - He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.\\
29 - That doesn't sound terrifying.\\
30 - To a white guy born here, no.\\
31 - If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it-- terrifying.\\
32 - You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.\\
33 - Wolowitz: And if that happens, we'll never be able to sell it commercially.\\
34 - There goes our big payday. I was counting on that money-- I need to make as much as my wife so I don't have to try so hard in bed.\\
35 - You do that, too?\\
36 - Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?\\
37 - Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue.\\
38 - We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex.\\
39 - Isn't that exciting?\\
40 - You're kidding, right?\\
41 - Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn't you ever think, "Hey, that could be me"?\\
42 - Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.\\
43 - Okay, Howard's on board. What do you think, Leonard?\\
44 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
45 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
46 -  The Earth began to cool \\
47 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
48 -  We built the Wall \\
49 -  We built the pyramids \\
50 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
51 -  That all started with a big bang \\
52 -  Bang! \\
53 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x02 \\
54 - The Military Miniaturization\\
55 - I'm worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he's been a nervous wreck.\\
56 - All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company.\\
57 - Get him some anti-anxiety meds.\\
58 - He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.\\
59 - You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.\\
60 - Does that help?\\
61 - Well, for a while. Then he comes back.\\
62 - I don't believe this.\\
63 - What's wrong?\\
64 - This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.\\
65 - You did already know, right?\\
66 - No one at the office did.\\
67 - Did you tell anyone?\\
68 - No. You told me not to.\\
69 - I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus.\\
70 - She might have heard me throwing up one morning.\\
71 - Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.\\
72 - Why don't you want anyone to know?\\
73 - 'Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.\\
74 - Would they really do that?\\
75 - I know they would-- they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.\\
76 - Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.\\
77 - Are you crazy?\\
78 - You can't put that on Snapchat.\\
79 - Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.\\
80 - You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.\\
81 - That's not a bad idea.\\
82 - Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer.\\
83 - Why? Because I'm Jewish?\\
84 - That's like me saying, "Hey, you're Indian. Doesn't your cousin work in a call center?"\\
85 - My cousin does work in a call center.\\
86 - And my cousin's a lawyer.\\
87 - We don't need Howard's cousin, no.\\
88 - We have me.\\
89 - You're not a lawyer, Sheldon, you're just a know-it-all.\\
90 - I am not a know-it-all.\\
91 - I'm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they're wrong.\\
92 - That's the definition of being a know-it-all.\\
93 - Or in German, a Besserwisser.\\
94 - How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?\\
95 - I had a plan-- I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.\\
96 - Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?\\
97 - From all the Dove Bars I ate! I'm pregnant!\\
98 - Try to keep up!\\
99 - I'm sorry. I-I have to go find out if my boss knows.\\
100 - Well, whatever happens, we're here for you.\\
101 - Thanks. You guys are the best.\\
102 - Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call...\\
103 - Oh, my God, it was me, it was me!\\
104 - I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!\\
105 - What?!\\
106 - I didn't mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistant one day. I...\\
107 - I forgot my coat.\\
108 - Oh! Here's your coat, honey.\\
109 - That's such a cute jacket.\\
110 - Oh...\\
111 - God, I feel so bad-- I just lied to her.\\
112 - Oh, but you did it so well.\\
113 - That's amazing!\\
114 - It's like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.\\
115 - Is that really what's important right now?\\
116 - I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you're being dishonest so I can see what lights up.\\
117 - That's super helpful, Amy.\\
118 - Thanks a lot. I can't wait to do that.\\
119 - I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin' up from here.\\
120 - Give me a second to call my cousin.\\
121 - I don't see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.\\
122 - First of all, he's in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale.\\
123 - But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he's clearly a smart guy.\\
124 - (Skype ringing)\\
125 - Hello.\\
126 - Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.\\
127 - Hey, no problem.\\
128 - Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.\\
129 - Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we're even.\\
130 - Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon.\\
131 - The three of us came up with the guidance system.\\
132 - Hi.\\
133 - Hello. And this is my friend, Raj.\\
134 - Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.\\
135 - I saw it. It's big.\\
136 - Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting's on Thursday.\\
137 - Do you have any advice for us?\\
138 - Well, I don't know much about patent law.\\
139 - But, uh, my advice is: hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don't sign anything.\\
140 - "Don't sign anything"? That's your advice?\\
141 - Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you'd recommend that we leave that unsigned?\\
142 - That's not what I meant.\\
143 - That's what you said.\\
144 - That's not what I meant.\\
145 - This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don't mean and meaning things you don't say.\\
146 - Howard, why is he yelling at me?\\
147 - All right, you were on Jeopardy.\\
148 - Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?\\
149 - Marty, let me call you back.\\
150 - Someday, when I'm up on murder charges, you'll be hearing from me.\\
151 - You don't need him. I'll represent you.\\
152 - Hi.\\
153 - Hey. What brings you by?\\
154 - Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.\\
155 - Oh. How was it?\\
156 - Great.\\
157 - Fell asleep?\\
158 - In, like, two minutes. Yeah.\\
159 - So, how is everything going around here?\\
160 - Are you still upset about people finding out you're pregnant?\\
161 - I'm furious.\\
162 - Sure, sure.\\
163 - Uh, did you ever figure out who told?\\
164 - No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn't know what I was talking about.\\
165 - Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights. (laughs)\\
166 - It had to be Barbara.\\
167 - I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her.\\
168 - Do you think using her work computer to Google "how to be a prostitute" is over the line?\\
169 - Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.\\
170 - What kind of revenge is that?\\
171 - This woman screwed with my job. She's got to pay.\\
172 - Okay, all right, honey, you know what?\\
173 - There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, a-and now... I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but... the truth is it... wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.\\
174 - I'm the reason everyone knows.\\
175 - Why did you do that?\\
176 - Well, it was an accident. I am so sorry I lied.\\
177 - Get out.\\
178 - (sighs)\\
179 - Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom.\\
180 - Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.\\
181 - I don't understand why I can't talk at this meeting.\\
182 - 'Cause when you talk, it enrages people.\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - Quick question.\\
185 - Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?\\
186 - Yes.\\
187 - Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?\\
188 - I'm getting enraged.\\
189 - Fine.\\
190 - Ooh.\\
191 - Can I use text-to-speech software?\\
192 - No!\\
193 - Don't speak.\\
194 - Male electronic voice: Aw, nuts.\\
195 - Man: Gentlemen!\\
196 - I'm Colonel Williams.\\
197 - Thank you for meeting with me.\\
198 - Hi.\\
199 - Hello.\\
200 - So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?\\
201 - It's a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.\\
202 - (muffled whimper)\\
203 - (machine whirring dies down)\\
204 - And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?\\
205 - Exactly.\\
206 - Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.\\
207 - Well, I'm a scientist by training.\\
208 - Wolowitz: Really?\\
209 - You're a physicist?\\
210 - Better. I'm an engineer.\\
211 - Where did you go to school?\\
212 - MIT.\\
213 - Oh. Well, hey, me, too.\\
214 - I should have known.\\
215 - Behind every great invention is an MIT mind.\\
216 - I'll cut to the chase.\\
217 - The Air Force believes there's an application for this technology, and we're interested in funding your research.\\
218 - Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.\\
219 - Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease.\\
220 - What we use it for is none of your business.\\
221 - I don't know how I feel about this.\\
222 - Look, guys, it's just a guidance system.\\
223 - It's not like you're handing us the Death Star from Star Trek.\\
224 - All you need to worry about is, right now, it's this big, and we need it to be... this big.\\
225 - That's a lot less big.\\
226 - Yes, it's... this much less big.\\
227 - I'm not even sure that's possible.\\
228 - Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.\\
229 - Four months?\\
230 - Yeah, we'll do it in two! (laughs)\\
231 - Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\\
232 - I'm the actual brains behind this project.\\
233 - Also, engineers aren't real scientists, MIT's a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek!\\
234 - But otherwise, thank you for your service.\\
235 - (knock at door)\\
236 - Hi.\\
237 - Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.\\
238 - Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.\\
239 - I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.\\
240 - Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?\\
241 - Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I'm guessing still angry?\\
242 - I'm sorry.\\
243 - My boss wants to meet with me, and I'm stressing.\\
244 - You really think they're gonna start treating you differently?\\
245 - Are you kidding?\\
246 - I've always been treated differently!\\
247 - Look at me! Listen to me!\\
248 - I mean, the first thought when you see me isn't, "That's a scientist."\\
249 - It's, "I wonder if her mommy knows where she is."\\
250 - I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.\\
251 - I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I don't want to get sent back to square one because I'm pregnant.\\
252 - I understand how you feel.\\
253 - Thank you.\\
254 - I wish there were some way I could make it better.\\
255 - Well, you brought me French fries. That's a start.\\
256 - Uh, actually, I got you apple slices 'cause you're pregnant.\\
257 - Apple slices?\\
258 - What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's and gets fruit?!\\
259 - I'll be right back.\\
260 - And a chocolate shake!\\
261 - (door opens)\\
262 - Hi.\\
263 - Hello.\\
264 - What are you doing?\\
265 - Oh, Leonard's mad at me, so I'm making him lemon bars.\\
266 - Does he even like lemon bars?\\
267 - Not really.\\
268 - But I'm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.\\
269 - Something happen at the meeting?\\
270 - They made me promise I wouldn't talk.\\
271 - And you talked?\\
272 - Well, now, see?\\
273 - You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn't they?\\
274 - Anyway, now we're committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone's upset with me.\\
275 - Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad at me, too.\\
276 - Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.\\
277 - Why would that make me feel better?\\
278 - Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better?\\
279 - At least mine was educational.\\
280 - Okay. Never mind.\\
281 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
282 - Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.\\
283 - Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant.\\
284 - She wasn't ready for them to know.\\
285 - Why would you do that?\\
286 - Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.\\
287 - See, that's exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.\\
288 - Is it even possible to get this done in two months?\\
289 - Well, maybe. I don't know. We'll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.\\
290 - Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.\\
291 - I love your French toast.\\
292 - Oh, thanks, man.\\
293 - So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?\\
294 - We didn't. Sheldon did.\\
295 - And you just let him?\\
296 - Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.\\
297 - No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying, "Okay."\\
298 - So I guess I won't be seeing you guys for a while.\\
299 - Oh, looks like it.\\
300 - Wow.\\
301 - You're going off to work with the military, leaving me behind.\\
302 - Now I know how all those army wives feel.\\
303 - Would you stop?\\
304 - We're just gonna be on the other side of campus.\\
305 - And right here.\\
306 - You are a deeply silly man.\\
307 - He is so afraid of his feelings.\\
308 - Oh, hi.\\
309 - Got a minute?\\
310 - Yeah, come on in.\\
311 - I just wanted to apologize.\\
312 - I know what you did was an accident.\\
313 - Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.\\
314 - For what it's worth, you're a great liar.\\
315 - Oh, that's what Amy said.\\
316 - So what's going on with the research project?\\
317 - Are they gonna let you run it?\\
318 - Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he's an old rich white guy, and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady who's not afraid to cry in front of a jury.\\
319 - You threatened to sue?\\
320 - Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you're four feet eleven and eye level with every guy's crotch, that's where you punch.\\
321 - That's funny.\\
322 - I learned something totally different.\\
323 - Do you know what?\\
324 - It's just a research project.\\
325 - The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child.\\
326 - It's all I need to give my life meaning.\\
327 - Oh, that's so beautiful.\\
328 - You believe me? Oh, good.\\
329 - 11 more chumps like you, I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.\\
330 - I never realized this building was classified.\\
331 - Maybe that's because it's classified.\\
332 - Wish we weren't so far from my parking space.\\
333 - The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that's a good thing.\\
334 - I'd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.\\
335 - Why? It clearly doesn't work.\\
336 - I guess this is it. (laughs)\\
337 - Leonard: Is that a retinal scanner?\\
338 - Let's find out.\\
339 - Female computerized voice: Howard Wolowitz-- access granted.\\
340 - All: No way! Impressive!\\
341 - Oh, my turn! My turn!\\
342 - Leonard Hofstadter-- access granted.\\
343 - I didn't even have to take my glasses off!\\
344 - Access denied.\\
345 - Both: It knows!\\
346 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down!\\
347 - Howard Wolowitz, access granted.\\
348 - All: Yay!
\subsection {Episode 03: The Dependence Transcendence}
1 - It's pretty late.\\
2 - You think I've got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?\\
3 - Sure, I'm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.\\
4 - Sheldon: Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day's thoughts.\\
5 - What?\\
6 - It's called sleep and it's my bedtime.\\
7 - Nighty-night, y'all.\\
8 - Hey, hey, hey, you're not going anywhere.\\
9 - We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.\\
10 - (yawning): I know, I was there.\\
11 - Well, wake up!\\
12 - We're gonna put in a lot of late nights.\\
13 - How late?\\
14 - Well, I don't know, midnight, 1:00.\\
15 - One o'clock?\\
16 - I'm not a raccoon.\\
17 - If you're tired, have some coffee.\\
18 - What?\\
19 - You have some coffee.\\
20 - I am having coffee!\\
21 - And look how irritable it's making you!\\
22 - Guys!\\
23 - We're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting.\\
24 - Now, can you please try to soldier through?\\
25 - (sighs)\\
26 - Fine.\\
27 - (clock ticking)\\
28 - I don't think I can go much longer.\\
29 - It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!\\
30 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
31 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
32 -  The Earth began to cool \\
33 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
34 -  We built the Wall \\
35 -  We built the pyramids \\
36 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
37 -  That all started with a big bang \\
38 -  Bang! \\
39 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x03 \\
40 - The Dependence Transcendence\\
41 - Sheldon: I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.\\
42 - Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.\\
43 - Good morning.\\
44 - What is this?\\
45 - Well, we didn't see you last night, we're not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.\\
46 - Oh, that is so nice.\\
47 - Ow, it does hurt!\\
48 - So, what are you guys gonna do today?\\
49 - Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don't think that's happening.\\
50 - Oh, that was never happening.\\
51 - Oh, I'll go.\\
52 - I like a party.\\
53 - Well, to be honest, it's not like a "party" party, it's more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what's going on in other fields.\\
54 - I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.\\
55 - It's okay, I'll still go.\\
56 - You don't think you'll be bored?\\
57 - Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand.\\
58 - I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?\\
59 - I won't be there.\\
60 - Look at that, it is a party.\\
61 - Penny: Oh.\\
62 - Sorry I have to work all weekend.\\
63 - It's okay.\\
64 - Thanks again for breakfast.\\
65 - Well, I didn't get to see you last night.\\
66 - It was the least I could do.\\
67 - You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.\\
68 - So, what should we do today?\\
69 - Oh, I appreciate it, but you don't have to spend your day off with me.\\
70 - Well, I don't mind.\\
71 - Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?\\
72 - Not really.\\
73 - Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.\\
74 - I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother's for Christmas.\\
75 - Oh, I know, why don't we get started on clearing out the baby's room?\\
76 - Isn't it a little early for that?\\
77 - You have to get to it eventually.\\
78 - Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.\\
79 - How can you be embarrassed around me?\\
80 - I'm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.\\
81 - I don't think you are.\\
82 - You didn't think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.\\
83 - Man: Psst, hey, kid.\\
84 - Huh, what?\\
85 - You look tired.\\
86 - Why don't you have an energy drink?\\
87 - Everyone's doing it.\\
88 - Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.\\
89 - Oh, sorry, I thought you were cool.\\
90 - I am cool.\\
91 - This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk's delicious watery cousin.\\
92 - All right.\\
93 - But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.\\
94 - Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?\\
95 - You bet.\\
96 - You know why Hulk is so strong?\\
97 - Steroids.\\
98 - You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights?\\
99 - Scotch.\\
100 - I am facing a great deal of work.\\
101 - And I do like things better when famous people also like them.\\
102 - Here.\\
103 - It's on the house.\\
104 - The first one's free?\\
105 - Flash, how do you stay in business?\\
106 - You want to know my secret?\\
107 - I bought stock in Marvel.\\
108 - Hi, Bert.\\
109 - This is my friend, Penny.\\
110 - Hi.\\
111 - Hey, come on in.\\
112 - I'll gonna go turn on some rock music.\\
113 - (Amy chuckles)\\
114 - That's a geology joke.\\
115 - Bert's a geologist.\\
116 - And a joker.\\
117 - How early are we?\\
118 - Oh, actually, we're an hour late.\\
119 - I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.\\
120 - I don't even know where to begin.\\
121 - Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says, "Let's start at the very beginning.\\
122 - A very good place to start."\\
123 - Oh, I was gonna start at the end.\\
124 - Thank God you're here.\\
125 - Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.\\
126 - Sorry.\\
127 - I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.\\
128 - Oh, that's a nice one.\\
129 - Was it yours when you were little?\\
130 - My dad built it for me.\\
131 - Wow, it's so cute.\\
132 - This was the husband and this was the wife.\\
133 - They'd go out on adventures together.\\
134 - Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.\\
135 - That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.\\
136 - Oh, and did they have kids?\\
137 - They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.\\
138 - Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.\\
139 - Not every girl dreams about being a mom.\\
140 - Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you're pregnant.\\
141 - And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog!\\
142 - I skipped spin class for this.\\
143 - Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?\\
144 - Oh, it's complicated.\\
145 - He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine uncomfortably intimate.\\
146 - (door opens)\\
147 - Gentlemen, I am ready to work.\\
148 - To quote The Martian, "Let's science the feces out of this!"\\
149 - That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian.\\
150 - Although to quote Marvin the Martian, (as Marvin the Martian): "I claim this planet in the name of Mars."\\
151 - Are you okay?\\
152 - Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.\\
153 - I had my first energy drink and I feel great.\\
154 - Hey, you guys want to wrestle?\\
155 - We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.\\
156 - Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.\\
157 - You wanted him awake.\\
158 - (rock music playing)\\
159 - So should we talk to each other or mingle?\\
160 - I don't know where everyone is.\\
161 - Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.\\
162 - Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.\\
163 - You don't have to stay.\\
164 - I'm gonna start cleaning up.\\
165 - Okay.\\
166 - I feel so bad about leaving him here.\\
167 - Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.\\
168 - Bert: Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university?\\
169 - You know, 'cause... you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.\\
170 - Wait, what do you mean "she's her"?\\
171 - Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?\\
172 - No. No.\\
173 - Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.\\
174 - What?\\
175 - You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?\\
176 - I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.\\
177 - Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular because he's dating you.\\
178 - Now Sheldon's popular?\\
179 - What is happening?\\
180 - (groans)\\
181 - Maybe we should break for lunch.\\
182 - What time is it?\\
183 - (moans twice)\\
184 - According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.\\
185 - My head hurts and I'm more tired than ever.\\
186 - Why don't you just go home?\\
187 - No, I can do this.\\
188 - I just, I just need another energy drink.\\
189 - Oh, no.\\
190 - What?\\
191 - I want another one.\\
192 - So?\\
193 - That's a craving.\\
194 - That's a sign of chemical dependency.\\
195 - You only had one.\\
196 - No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure.\\
197 - I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.\\
198 - You know once one pops one just can't stop.\\
199 - You can't develop a problem that fast.\\
200 - You want to bet?\\
201 - Oh, great, now I'm addicted to gambling.\\
202 - We can't afford to lose any more time.\\
203 - Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whoop the crazy out of him?\\
204 - That's not helpful.\\
205 - It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful.\\
206 - Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.\\
207 - We can't do this without you.\\
208 - Can you please pull it together?\\
209 - I'm sorry. Yes, of course.\\
210 - Thank you.\\
211 - Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.\\
212 - No worries.\\
213 - You guys stink.\\
214 - Sorry I flipped out on you.\\
215 - I think it's just hormones.\\
216 - I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it's fine.\\
217 - So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?\\
218 - Does it really need one?\\
219 - Of course it does.\\
220 - Didn't your baby room have a theme?\\
221 - Well, it doubled as my dad's office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.\\
222 - Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.\\
223 - But anyway... why don't we just take a step back and start with a color?\\
224 - Right? There are so many amazing ones.\\
225 - Red, blue, green, purple...\\
226 - Are you just gonna name all the colors?\\
227 - Well, not now.\\
228 - I don't care what color the room is.\\
229 - Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.\\
230 - Well, you're not, so just drop it!\\
231 - I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?\\
232 - Sorry! Sorry!\\
233 - And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.\\
234 - You trend setter!\\
235 - Just the right idea at the right time.\\
236 - Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.\\
237 - Tell me about Leonard.\\
238 - Who?\\
239 - Leonard Hofstadter.\\
240 - Oh, him. I guess he's all right.\\
241 - Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.\\
242 - That's me, I'm her.\\
243 - You know, he didn't trick me.\\
244 - He just wore me down.\\
245 - It makes sense you two are friends.\\
246 - I mean, hot girls always stick together.\\
247 - And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.\\
248 - You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.\\
249 - Well, it's not exactly like it.\\
250 - We're all extremely smart.\\
251 - Wow... you popular girls are mean.\\
252 - I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?\\
253 - Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?\\
254 - Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.\\
255 - I do.\\
256 - You don't.\\
257 - Yeah, but I do.\\
258 - No, you don't!\\
259 - But let's say you do.\\
260 - And don't say you do, because you don't!\\
261 - Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?\\
262 - With what?\\
263 - Your problem.\\
264 - I thought I didn't have a problem.\\
265 - That was painful to watch.\\
266 - So where are we going?\\
267 - I don't know.\\
268 - Okay.\\
269 - How Thelma and Louise of us.\\
270 - Raj, why don't I care about anything?\\
271 - I'm sorry?\\
272 - It's my baby.\\
273 - I-I should care about nurseries and colors, and I don't-- what's wrong with me?\\
274 - Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.\\
275 - I keep waiting to feel excited, but it's not happening.\\
276 - What if it never happens?\\
277 - Bernadette, come on, look, you're overthinking this, okay?\\
278 - You're gonna be an amazing mom.\\
279 - Even if you don't believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.\\
280 - Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers.\\
281 - Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.\\
282 - Happy and well-fed.\\
283 - You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.\\
284 - Leonard, can I ask you a question?\\
285 - Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?\\
286 - Howard, can I ask you a question?\\
287 - No.\\
288 - All right, I'll just toss this out to the room.\\
289 - Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps.\\
290 - Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.\\
291 - Yeah.\\
292 - You know, the interesting fact about the rectum...\\
293 - Sheldon!\\
294 - We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you.\\
295 - So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink.\\
296 - Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want, I don't care!\\
297 - You don't shove them.\\
298 - They come with an easy-glide applicator.\\
299 - Right. Listen to me.\\
300 - We can't do anything until you do your part.\\
301 - So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it!\\
302 - I can't.\\
303 - Yes, you can.\\
304 - No... I can't figure out the math. I've been racking my brain for days, and I've got nothing.\\
305 - Seriously?\\
306 - I can't do it.\\
307 - I'm not as smart as I think I am.\\
308 - I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.\\
309 - It's okay, we'll figure something out.\\
310 - But what if we can't?\\
311 - It'll be fine. You'll see.\\
312 - Sheldon?\\
313 - Buddy?\\
314 - (snoring)\\
315 - When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.\\
316 - Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.\\
317 - My pleasure.\\
318 - You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?\\
319 - I think we're good.\\
320 - Okay, well, thanks for coming by.\\
321 - You're nice people.\\
322 - Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.\\
323 - You need to leave.\\
324 - I'm in love with both of you now.\\
325 - Okay. Bye.\\
326 - Uh, pull over.\\
327 - What? Why? Who are you calling?\\
328 - You're gonna rat me out to Howard, aren't you?\\
329 - You're such a snitch, no wonder I don't like you.\\
330 - Whoa, I'm calling my dad, okay?\\
331 - He's got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he's an OBGYN.\\
332 - And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.\\
333 - (Facetime ringing)\\
334 - Hello, Rajesh.\\
335 - Are you calling to ask for money?\\
336 - What? No.\\
337 - Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?\\
338 - No.\\
339 - Great. What's up?\\
340 - This is my friend, Bernadette.\\
341 - She's pregnant, and she's a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.\\
342 - Of course.\\
343 - What seems to be the trouble?\\
344 - Something's wrong.\\
345 - I don't care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into.\\
346 - Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.\\
347 - Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people.\\
348 - It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.\\
349 - But I thought I'd be more excited.\\
350 - Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything.\\
351 - Rajesh's mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him.\\
352 - After he was born, she doted on his every move.\\
353 - And you know what happened?\\
354 - He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women.\\
355 - So you never know.\\
356 - Thank you. I feel better now.\\
357 - I don't!\\
358 - Father: Good.\\
359 - Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.\\
360 - Um, I don't really know how to say this.\\
361 - Well, you could try starting with "sir".\\
362 - Right. Sorry, sir.\\
363 - He said start with it, not end with it.\\
364 - Sir...\\
365 - Hmm?\\
366 - We've hit a bit of a snag.\\
367 - We're already behind schedule.\\
368 - The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.\\
369 - I understand that we're under contract, and I don't know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh... we're not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.\\
370 - (sighs)\\
371 - How long do you need?\\
372 - (Wolowitz clears throat)\\
373 - We-We're thinking... two years.\\
374 - All right.\\
375 - (chuckles) That's it?\\
376 - You're okay with that?\\
377 - (scoffs) You think you're the first government contractor who isn't gonna deliver on time?\\
378 - We're still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.\\
379 - Thanks for understanding, sir.\\
380 - Yes, thank you so much.\\
381 - We-We really appreciate it.\\
382 - Leonard: All right, pressure's off...\\
383 - Wolowitz (sighs): Wanna see a movie?\\
384 - Sheldon: Popcorn's on me.
\subsection {Episode 04: The Cohabitation Experimentation}
1 - There was water everywhere.\\
2 - It was such a mess.\\
3 - That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?\\
4 - About five weeks.\\
5 - Ugh! Did you lose anything valuable?\\
6 - Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.\\
7 - Oh, so nothing. Great.\\
8 - Do they know why the pipe burst?\\
9 - They didn't say.\\
10 - Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water.\\
11 - Can't have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.\\
12 - Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.\\
13 - Really?\\
14 - Of course.\\
15 - You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll stay at my place.\\
16 - You're sure that's not an inconvenience?\\
17 - No, not at all.\\
18 - And we live with Sheldon, so the word "inconvenience" has really lost all meaning.\\
19 - So, technically, I'd be moving in with my boyfriend?\\
20 - I guess so.\\
21 - I'd finally get to live alone with my husband.\\
22 - Oh, my, this is a big step.\\
23 - Mm-hmm.\\
24 - For two of us, it's in the right direction.\\
25 - Why are you all smiling like crazy people?\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
27 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
28 -  The Earth began to cool \\
29 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
30 -  We built the Wall \\
31 -  We built the pyramids \\
32 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
33 -  That all started with a big bang \\
34 -  Bang! \\
35 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x04 \\
36 - The Cohabitation Experimentation\\
37 - Cohabitation with my girlfriend?\\
38 - That's a great deal to process.\\
39 - Mm.\\
40 - It's only for five weeks.\\
41 - Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.\\
42 - What do you think?\\
43 - I don't know.\\
44 - What if living together kills the romance?\\
45 - Okay, you guys had s*x one whole time.\\
46 - Nothing can put out a fire like that.\\
47 - Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain?\\
48 - I mean, she's never even seen me unshaven.\\
49 - You just shaved yesterday.\\
50 - You're good for three months.\\
51 - Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you.\\
52 - Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?\\
53 - Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.\\
54 - Leonard: Okay.\\
55 - Star Trek: The Original Series.\\
56 - The Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds.\\
57 - Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.\\
58 - If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.\\
59 - Don't be proud of that.\\
60 - So, is that a yes?\\
61 - Not yet. I...\\
62 - How will I learn if I'm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I'm in my own apartment?\\
63 - Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.\\
64 - Well, where would you go?\\
65 - Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico.\\
66 - Where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste.\\
67 - And you were worried about the romance.\\
68 - Penny: Wait.\\
69 - Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?\\
70 - Interesting.\\
71 - If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I'd need to knock every time I came over here.\\
72 - That's a good question.\\
73 - Maybe just don't come over.\\
74 - Historically, I don't do well with change.\\
75 - Okay, it won't be that bad.\\
76 - We wouldn't even sit in your spot while you're gone.\\
77 - You're darn right, you wouldn't.\\
78 - No matter where I am, this will always be my spot.\\
79 - Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.\\
80 - Just nod and smile. He's almost gone.\\
81 - Sheldon, what do you think?\\
82 - (sighs)\\
83 - Very well. I'm on board.\\
84 - Seriously?\\
85 - Yes.\\
86 - I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.\\
87 - Oh. This is so exciting.\\
88 - Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, it's canceled in three.\\
89 - I have to say, I am happy with your ob-gyn.\\
90 - Cool. 'Cause she says you're doing a great job as "weird friend who doesn't have to be at every appointment."\\
91 - I'm the son of a gynecologist. I could be helpful.\\
92 - Bernadette: It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.\\
93 - The polite response is, "Thank you for noticing."\\
94 - Let me see the sonogram again.\\
95 - (laughs)\\
96 - Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little gray blob.\\
97 - Yeah, we could name him Blobert.\\
98 - What if it's a girl?\\
99 - Bloberta.\\
100 - Or Blobbi with an "I."\\
101 - Are we being silly not finding out the s*x?\\
102 - Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.\\
103 - If you want, you can find out right now.\\
104 - Mm.\\
105 - Hmm.\\
106 - The doctor's gone for the day, so it doesn't matter.\\
107 - Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.\\
108 - You looked in our folder?!\\
109 - It was an accident.\\
110 - The doctor left the folder out on her desk.\\
111 - It's not my fault I opened it and looked.\\
112 - So you know the s*x of our baby, and we don't?!\\
113 - Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.\\
114 - It's unbelievable.\\
115 - God, Raj.\\
116 - What?\\
117 - This is not a problem, okay?\\
118 - If you don't want to know, I don't have to tell you.\\
119 - We don't want you to know!\\
120 - Okay, well, that's a problem.\\
121 - You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.\\
122 - Oh. Thank you.\\
123 - Mm.\\
124 - Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys.\\
125 - One pair that was neither dating nor living together.\\
126 - One pair that was dating but not living together.\\
127 - One pair that was living together but not dating.\\
128 - And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating.\\
129 - Although, with that many Sheldons, it'd be such a party, we'd never get anything done.\\
130 - That was a cute story.\\
131 - So, um...\\
132 - What did you want to ask me?\\
133 - Well, you've lived with your significant other for some time.\\
134 - I would like this experiment to go well.\\
135 - Are there any insights you can share?\\
136 - Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.\\
137 - You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.\\
138 - You've been roommates with Sheldon forever.\\
139 - Do you have any advice?\\
140 - I'm trying to think of an answer that won't stop you from doing this.\\
141 - I know it sounds like a cliché, but compromise is key.\\
142 - Never leave a belt on the floor.\\
143 - At night, they look like snakes.\\
144 - Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.\\
145 - Keep M&M'S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.\\
146 - You're gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other's personal space.\\
147 - He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.\\
148 - How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?\\
149 - I don't know. I didn't count.\\
150 - You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.\\
151 - That's me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed.\\
152 - You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us.\\
153 - How are you feeling about that?\\
154 - Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared.\\
155 - All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.\\
156 - Well, if you're nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.\\
157 - Okay.\\
158 - Talk.\\
159 - Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations.\\
160 - Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it.\\
161 - Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone.\\
162 - So why don't we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we're more settled in, we can revisit it.\\
163 - You're really okay with that?\\
164 - I've never lived with someone, either.\\
165 - This is a lot for me, too.\\
166 - (sighs)\\
167 - This is such a relief.\\
168 - Honestly, if it didn't get you all worked up, I'd kiss you right now.\\
169 - Good call.\\
170 - Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.\\
171 - I know. They probably shouldn't sell those to children.\\
172 - Well, here's your key.\\
173 - Thank you.\\
174 - Enjoy having the place to yourselves.\\
175 - You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.\\
176 - It's Penny's bedroom.\\
177 - Plenty of men have gone before.\\
178 - Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.\\
179 - Shall we?\\
180 - I guess this is it.\\
181 - You guys have fun.\\
182 - You, too.\\
183 - Oh, don't forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.\\
184 - Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.\\
185 - Oh.\\
186 - (chuckles softly)\\
187 - Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.\\
188 - I'm on it.\\
189 - 15 years from now, we'll make guacamole together.\\
190 - Leonard, please, let me go.\\
191 - Come on, Sheldon.\\
192 - Oh. Bye.\\
193 - Good night.\\
194 - Good night.\\
195 - Well, that's it.\\
196 - For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.\\
197 - I guess the experiment begins.\\
198 - Penny (whoops): We did it!\\
199 - Leonard: Yeah!\\
200 - Which side of the bed would you prefer?\\
201 - Doesn't matter to me. Your choice.\\
202 - No, no, we're living together now-- everything's equal.\\
203 - You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.\\
204 - Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.\\
205 - Well, clearly, it's not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.\\
206 - Well, I'm not refusing.\\
207 - I'm just trying to be considerate.\\
208 - Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?\\
209 - Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?\\
210 - Fine.\\
211 - (sighs)\\
212 - Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.\\
213 - Great. That's your side.\\
214 - No, but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.\\
215 - Okay, I'll take that side.\\
216 - Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?\\
217 - Rising rapidly.\\
218 - Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.\\
219 - Okay.\\
220 - What if we do this?\\
221 - I suppose that works.\\
222 - Great.\\
223 - Although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes.\\
224 - This is ridiculous.\\
225 - The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey's Anatomy online fan group probably knows.\\
226 - Is it weird we don't?\\
227 - I don't know.\\
228 - Maybe the surprise will make it more fun.\\
229 - Like magic tricks.\\
230 - Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?\\
231 - I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.\\
232 - But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves?\\
233 - It'll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.\\
234 - Everyone said I could do better.\\
235 - But you didn't listen, and presto change-o, my baby's inside you. Ta-da!\\
236 - (brushing teeth)\\
237 - (Amy hawks, spits)\\
238 - Amy: Ugh. What is that?\\
239 - (door opens)\\
240 - Why'd you switch sides?\\
241 - Be grateful I'm still in the room.\\
242 - Comfy?\\
243 - Oh, I'm just happy I don't know what this memory foam remembers.\\
244 - Sheldon?\\
245 - I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.\\
246 - Well, it's funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you'd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.\\
247 - Sheldon, I've made more than enough accommodations for you.\\
248 - We're both grown adults-- we've been far more intimate than this.\\
249 - If you don't want to snuggle, fine-- but we're not building a pillow wall.\\
250 - Okay, well, I am sorry.\\
251 - I'm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night.\\
252 - And no offense, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I'm surprised there aren't iguanas lying on it.\\
253 - That's it. It's Sheldon's bedtime.\\
254 - He is in for the night.\\
255 - Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.\\
256 - (chuckles): It's weird.\\
257 - This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college.\\
258 - Unless they feel sad-- then it's different.\\
259 - So, what do you want to do?\\
260 - I know exactly what we are gonna do.\\
261 - Really? You're a genius, and that's the first thing you come up with?\\
262 - Hey, Sheldon's not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.\\
263 - Ugh. Can we just have s*x?\\
264 - Oh, don't worry.\\
265 - Once you see my sweet moves, s*x is inevitable.\\
266 - (intro to "You Never Can Tell" playing)\\
267 -  It was a teenage wedding \\
268 -  And the old folks wished them well \\
269 -  You could see that Pierre \\
270 -  Did truly love the mademoiselle \\
271 -  And now the young monsieur... \\
272 - Inevitable, you say?\\
273 - I'll just let my hips do the talkin'.\\
274 -  It goes to show you never can tell... \\
275 - Screw it. I'm calling and finding out.\\
276 - Good. Call him.\\
277 - Wait, I'm not sure I want to know.\\
278 - But you just said you wanted to know.\\
279 - Well, now I don't know if I want to know!\\
280 - Hello?\\
281 - Call you back.\\
282 - No, Dr. Feynman.\\
283 - If I solve it for you, you'll never learn.\\
284 -  Tootsee Roll \\
285 -  Tootsee Roll \\
286 -  Tootsee Roll, Tootsee Roll... \\
287 - Wow! Where did you learn these moves?\\
288 - The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.\\
289 -  To the left, to the left \\
290 -  To the right, to the right, to the front. \\
291 - Okay, you're positive you want to know?\\
292 - Yes.\\
293 - Okay. Here we go.\\
294 - It's ringing.\\
295 - (ringtone playing)\\
296 - Hello?\\
297 - Wait.\\
298 - Wrong number.\\
299 - (moans)\\
300 - (moans)\\
301 - (moans)\\
302 - (moans)\\
303 - (moans)\\
304 - (moans)\\
305 - (inhales)\\
306 - I told you not to do the worm.\\
307 - (holding breath): You were right.\\
308 - (ringtone playing)\\
309 - Hello.\\
310 - Bernadette: I changed my mind! Hang up! Hang up!\\
311 - Oh.\\
312 - Oh.\\
313 - Oh, gee-- oh!\\
314 - What are you doing down there?\\
315 - Hang on.\\
316 - Who are you calling?\\
317 - (click)\\
318 - (screams)\\
319 - I'm so sore. I don't think I slept two minutes last night.\\
320 - Yeah, get it, girl.\\
321 - It's not what you think.\\
322 - I feel like I pulled something.\\
323 - Why didn't you tell me to stop?\\
324 - Even more not what you think.\\
325 - I don't know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.\\
326 - If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - Good morning.\\
329 - See? I didn't knock, but it's fine.\\
330 - I didn't knock, but it's fine. I didn't knock, but it's fine.\\
331 - So, how is everyone?\\
332 - Miserable and exhausted.\\
333 - Really? I slept great.\\
334 - Well, I didn't, and it's your fault.\\
335 - How? You had the whole floor to yourself.\\
336 - (sighs) Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.\\
337 - Well... Yeah, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?\\
338 - The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.\\
339 - Wow.\\
340 - I anticipated we'd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigor would be one of them.\\
341 - I'm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?\\
342 - If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.\\
343 - Was that a science diss?\\
344 - Yeah.\\
345 - Was it a good one?\\
346 - Eh.\\
347 - Ah.\\
348 - What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway?\\
349 - I mean, you wouldn't know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time!\\
350 - And you don't even get that joke, 'cause you don't even work with confounding variables!\\
351 - How dare you?\\
352 - Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.\\
353 - Whoa, whoa! Now you're making fun of my bona fides?\\
354 - Can't make fun of something that's a null set.\\
355 - Penny: I feel like I should say "damn."\\
356 - Do it.\\
357 - Damn!\\
358 - Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.\\
359 - Well, for science, maybe I will!\\
360 - For science, maybe you should!\\
361 - Fine!\\
362 - Fine!\\
363 - Good.\\
364 - Great.\\
365 - Do you want to go to our place and make out?\\
366 - Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?\\
367 - The new neighbors are weird.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Hot Tub Contamination}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Cohabitation with my girlfriend?\\
3 - That's a great deal to process.\\
4 - Hmm?\\
5 - It's only for five weeks.\\
6 - Let me appeal to the scientist in you.\\
7 - Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?\\
8 - Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.\\
9 - Leonard: Okay.\\
10 - Star Trek: The Original Series.\\
11 - The Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds.\\
12 - Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.\\
13 - Oh, you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.\\
14 - Okay, why don't you guys stay across the hall and we will live here?\\
15 - (exhales)\\
16 - Very well. I'm on board.\\
17 - Seriously?\\
18 - Yes.\\
19 - I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.\\
20 - Oh. This is so exciting.\\
21 - Well, now, don't be surprised if, like Star Trek, it's canceled in three.\\
22 - (dramatic music playing)\\
23 - Okay, I'm confused.\\
24 - Which one is Mr. Robot?\\
25 - I'll give you a hint.\\
26 - We're watching Daredevil.\\
27 - Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?\\
28 - Can't.\\
29 - Won't.\\
30 - Didn't.\\
31 - Don't.\\
32 - Amy: I told you, you can't regulate every aspect of our lives.\\
33 - I can if you'd just roll over and accept your fate.\\
34 - I'm sorry for bringing this over here.\\
35 - Believe me, we know what you're going through.\\
36 - And I-I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.\\
37 - Mm-hmm.\\
38 - Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and I'm willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise.\\
39 - She's right. That's reasonable.\\
40 - Oh, look who's in favor of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter.\\
41 - Hey, she didn't compromise.\\
42 - She settled. There's a difference.\\
43 - Yeah. You tell him, babe.\\
44 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
45 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
46 -  The Earth began to cool \\
47 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
48 -  We built the Wall \\
49 -  We built the pyramids \\
50 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
51 -  That all started with a big bang \\
52 -  Bang! \\
53 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x05 \\
54 - The Hot Tub Contamination\\
55 - What time do you and Bernadette head out?\\
56 - As soon as I get home.\\
57 - We're hoping to make it before dark.\\
58 - I've never been to Palm Springs.\\
59 - Oh, you should go.\\
60 - It's terrific. I-I really thrive anywhere the women and the temperature are over 90.\\
61 - I don't know.\\
62 - If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India.\\
63 - It's nice you and Bernadette are getting away.\\
64 - Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.\\
65 - So then what are you doing here buying comic books?\\
66 - Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes.\\
67 - When you live with someone, there's gonna be conflict.\\
68 - You just have to keep communicating.\\
69 - I'm open to that.\\
70 - Okay. Well, for starters, there's nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder.\\
71 - Sheldon, what do you say to that?\\
72 - I think we should see other people.\\
73 - What?!\\
74 - Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA.\\
75 - Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature.\\
76 - We sleep together once a year!\\
77 - You want other partners?\\
78 - Don't blame me. Blame your pal, biology.\\
79 - He's the pervert pulling the strings here.\\
80 - You wanna see other people? Go see other people.\\
81 - (arguing indistinctly)\\
82 - I hope one of those people is a monkey, 'cause this is bananas.\\
83 - You can make jokes, but if this keeps up, he's gonna move back in here.\\
84 -  All right. Well, let's just get them apart for a while so they can cool down.\\
85 - Good.\\
86 - Then before we reintroduce them, we'll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again.\\
87 - So it's okay for you to joke around?\\
88 - No, that's actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space.\\
89 - Honey, how ya feeling?\\
90 - (Bernadette retching loudly)\\
91 - The book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away.\\
92 - (retching)\\
93 - So that's good news, right?\\
94 - The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book!\\
95 - (toilet flushes)\\
96 - There she is! (chuckles)\\
97 - Who's ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?\\
98 - Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.\\
99 - I'm sorry.\\
100 - We don't have to go.\\
101 - But it's our last chance to take a vacation that's just the two of us.\\
102 - How 'bout we stay here?\\
103 - We don't even have to tell anyone.\\
104 - It'll be like a secret vacation at home.\\
105 - (chuckles)\\
106 - Keeping secrets from our friends-- that does sound kinda fun.\\
107 - Does it sound... sexy?\\
108 - You just heard me throwing up.\\
109 - You bet I did.\\
110 - You're so weird.\\
111 - You know what's weird?\\
112 - How turned on you are right now.\\
113 - You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging.\\
114 - Just as challenging.\\
115 - Yes.\\
116 - As you.\\
117 - Yes.\\
118 - Just as challenging as you.\\
119 - When we're sleeping, she breathes on me.\\
120 - One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto and headed for the storm cellar.\\
121 - Leonard breathes on me, too.\\
122 - It's not a big deal.\\
123 - She's always complaining about people at work.\\
124 - Well, so does Leonard.\\
125 - It's kind of annoying, but it's not the end of the world.\\
126 - Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like I'm a piece of meat?\\
127 - You know, so does Leonard.\\
128 - Can't I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?\\
129 - "Hey." (chuckles)\\
130 - I know.\\
131 - Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.\\
132 - Agreed! Thank you!\\
133 - That feels great.\\
134 - Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isn't the only magic these hands can do.\\
135 - In fact, wh-what's this between your toes?!\\
136 - Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes?\\
137 - (door opens)\\
138 - (door shuts)\\
139 - (quietly): Was that the front door?\\
140 - (quietly): It sounded like it.\\
141 - (footsteps)\\
142 - Oh, my God. Someone's in the house.\\
143 - Lock the door, lock the door!\\
144 - We should call the police.\\
145 - Uh... I left my phone downstairs.\\
146 - Damn, so did I.\\
147 - Wait, I have my iPad!\\
148 - What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?\\
149 - That's not helpful!\\
150 - You know I rely on humor in times of stress.\\
151 - Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny!\\
152 - (whirring)\\
153 - (bubbling)\\
154 - Is that the hot tub?\\
155 - Who would use our hot tub?\\
156 - (sighs)\\
157 - Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think.\\
158 - Who is it?\\
159 - Stuart.\\
160 - He heard me talking about us going away.\\
161 - I guess he decided to invite himself over?\\
162 - Should we say something to him?\\
163 - Maybe. How 'bout, "Hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast"?\\
164 - I meant like, "What are you doing here?"\\
165 - Nah, that's not gonna hurt his feelings.\\
166 - Why is nothing easy with him?\\
167 - Look, here's the thing you need to understand about Sheldon: he's the worst.\\
168 - I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.\\
169 - I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed.\\
170 - I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.\\
171 - Don't beat yourself up.\\
172 - You've never lived with anyone before.\\
173 - That's true.\\
174 - And you're starting out with Sheldon Cooper.\\
175 - That's like getting your first pet and having it be--\\
176 - I don't know...\\
177 - What's a kind of pet that ruins your life?\\
178 - You're not making me feel better.\\
179 - Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a-a learning curve.\\
180 - But I promise you, it does get easier.\\
181 - He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, "Number of days without Amy's hair on the soap."\\
182 - Yeah.\\
183 - My record was six.\\
184 - Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?\\
185 - Maybe this is why people get fish tanks.\\
186 - (click)\\
187 - Who just turned the porch lights on?\\
188 - Is someone else here?\\
189 - Hmm. They must have left the tub on.\\
190 - Good thing I stopped by.\\
191 - Ah!\\
192 - (gasping)\\
193 - (screaming)\\
194 - (screaming)\\
195 - What are you doing here?!\\
196 - What are you doing here?!\\
197 - Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here!\\
198 - Did they?\\
199 - Answer the question! What are you doing here?!\\
200 - I had nothing else to do tonight.\\
201 - The last couple of months, I come here when I know they're not home.\\
202 - What?!\\
203 - They heard me in the bushes once, but they thought it was a raccoon.\\
204 - I told you raccoons don't say "Uh-oh."\\
205 - You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track.\\
206 - Have you noticed it's always an A-flat?\\
207 - Is it?\\
208 - (whistles)\\
209 - Oh!\\
210 - It's like his sinuses are right here in the car.\\
211 - If we're just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream.\\
212 - Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.\\
213 - Well, see, why can't Amy be that subservient?\\
214 - She has coitus one time, suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.\\
215 - Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlor will be a good place to meet other women.\\
216 - Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with one person.\\
217 - Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?\\
218 - Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within.\\
219 - When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, "hubba hubba" like any other guy.\\
220 - You kiss your mother with that mouth?\\
221 - 'Cause it's fine.\\
222 - Here you go.\\
223 - Thank you.\\
224 - Shall we toast?\\
225 - To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.\\
226 - You said you got it back.\\
227 - Well, clearly, I lied.\\
228 - So how's your apartment?\\
229 - Not great. The electricity's out.\\
230 - So why don't you get it fixed?\\
231 - I called, and they're like, "Pay your bill!"\\
232 - Of you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.\\
233 - Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience.\\
234 - You've got all your lady friends, and...\\
235 - Actually, I'm single now.\\
236 - Stuart: What?!\\
237 - When did that happen?\\
238 - It's okay. It's by choice.\\
239 - Well, their choice, and it's not okay.\\
240 - Oh. Sorry. I didn't know.\\
241 - Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didn't say anything.\\
242 - Why wouldn't he tell us?\\
243 - Are we bad friends?\\
244 - He's in our hot tub drinking our wine.\\
245 - Yeah, he deserves to be alone.\\
246 - So you're back out on the dating scene now?\\
247 - Yeah, yeah, a little.\\
248 - Oh, that must be fun. How's that going?\\
249 - I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.\\
250 - Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.\\
251 - No, don't do that.\\
252 - But you did!\\
253 - Exactly!\\
254 - Learn from my mistakes!\\
255 - No matter where I am at 7:18 a.m., there better be a toilet nearby.\\
256 - It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.\\
257 - Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished.\\
258 - Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?\\
259 - Me.\\
260 - And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?\\
261 - Me.\\
262 - It was mittens.\\
263 - Mm.\\
264 - And who got him to try a turkey dog?\\
265 - That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.\\
266 - Look, how can you stop now?\\
267 - That's like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.\\
268 - You know, you're right.\\
269 - I'm in this relationship, too.\\
270 - I need to stand up for myself.\\
271 - Of course you do.\\
272 - And if he doesn't like it, he can move back here.\\
273 - Oh. He can try. He'd just need a good locksmith.\\
274 - Well, who you gonna hit on?\\
275 - The girl in front of us got strawberry.\\
276 - That's your favorite.\\
277 - No. No, if we both like it, I'll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, "Aw, no strawberry."\\
278 - What about the girl behind the counter?\\
279 - Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping.\\
280 - One arm's probably bigger than the other.\\
281 - Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?\\
282 - You are truly wise.\\
283 - Thank you.\\
284 - I'd say wise beyond your years, but you're getting up there.\\
285 - All right.\\
286 - Come on. What is really going on with you?\\
287 - Penny, I am going to tell you a story that I've never told anyone.\\
288 - All right.\\
289 - I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college.\\
290 - Not relating. Go on.\\
291 - I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.\\
292 - Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.\\
293 - My mother was at bible study.\\
294 - I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parents' bedroom.\\
295 - When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman.\\
296 - Oh, that's awful!\\
297 - I know.\\
298 - It's also why I never open a door without knocking three times.\\
299 - I mean, the first one's traditional, but two and three are for people to get their pants on.\\
300 - Well, what happened with your dad?\\
301 - We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it.\\
302 - You poor thing.\\
303 - Since Amy and I have been living together, we've been bickering like my parents used to.\\
304 - And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad did?\\
305 - Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.\\
306 - Down the road?\\
307 - Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream parlor trying to pick up women!\\
308 - Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone.\\
309 - Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain you're causing her right now?\\
310 - (sighs)\\
311 - I'm sure you're right.\\
312 - I suppose I should apologize to you, as well.\\
313 - Okay.\\
314 - That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you.\\
315 - Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.\\
316 - Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.\\
317 - I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadette's baby.\\
318 - I don't know. Bernadette's baby doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.\\
319 - Those jets are for my secret spot, not his!\\
320 - What do you do in there?!\\
321 - It's called relaxing, and that's all you need to know.\\
322 - Well, it's getting late.\\
323 - Maybe we should head home.\\
324 - Yeah, you're probably right.\\
325 - (sighs)\\
326 - You coming?\\
327 - Yeah, just give me a minute.\\
328 - Why?\\
329 - Well, you know how you're wearing a bathing suit?\\
330 - Yeah?\\
331 - I kind of went the other way.\\
332 - You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!\\
333 - What do you think?\\
334 - It's a nice enough spot.\\
335 - You know, if I'm going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thing...\\
336 - We're back!\\
337 - Oh, hi! Hi!\\
338 - Hello.\\
339 - How you guys doing?\\
340 - We're doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.\\
341 - (sighs)\\
342 - I wanted to apologize for my behavior today. It...\\
343 - (clears his throat)\\
344 - It was unnecessary.\\
345 - This is warm.\\
346 - Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule.\\
347 - Oh. Really?\\
348 - Why does she get that?! We never got that!\\
349 - Do you want him back?\\
350 - I'm very happy for you.\\
351 - Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women.\\
352 - And to prove how serious I am about us, I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level.\\
353 - Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?\\
354 - I would love to.\\
355 - Leonard: Did we really need to be here for this?\\
356 - Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Fetal Kick Catalyst}
1 - Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?\\
2 - ‭Yeah.\\
3 - It's a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?\\
4 - I got asked to sign autographs there.\\
5 - That's awesome!\\
6 - Is this for Serial Ape-ist?\\
7 - Well, it could be for the monkey movie.\\
8 - It could be my hemorrhoid commercial.\\
9 - The list does not go on.\\
10 - When is it?\\
11 - It doesn't matter.\\
12 - I'm not doing it.\\
13 - What? Why not?\\
14 - You just said yourself, it's sad.\\
15 - Yeah, but it's not pathetic.\\
16 - That's where I draw the line.\\
17 - Come on! We'll have fun.\\
18 - I don't know.\\
19 - You'll have nerds fawning all over you.\\
20 - If you don't love that, this marriage is in trouble.\\
21 - I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.\\
22 - Yeah.\\
23 - Wow! An appearance by George Lucas... 's dermatologist.\\
24 - Oh, I want that autograph.\\
25 - Oh, yeah.\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
27 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
28 -  The Earth began to cool \\
29 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
30 -  We built the Wall \\
31 -  We built the pyramids \\
32 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
33 -  That all started with a big bang \\
34 -  Bang! \\
35 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x06 \\
36 - The Fetal Kick Catalyst\\
37 - You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.\\
38 - We have people over all the time.\\
39 - We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man... that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.\\
40 - You know what I meant.\\
41 - All right, fine.\\
42 - Let's say that we were to entertain people.\\
43 - What type of gathering did you have in mind?\\
44 - Huh? A meal? Lunch?\\
45 - Brunch? Dinner?\\
46 - Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm?\\
47 - Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party?\\
48 - Is it a cocktail party?\\
49 - A Tupperware party?\\
50 - Ooh, yeah-- is it a surprise party?\\
51 - Oh, I hope it's not a West Coast party, 'cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don't stop.\\
52 - I'm sorry I mentioned it.\\
53 - Oh, don't be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That's called teamwork.\\
54 - (gasps)\\
55 - That's a kick.\\
56 - That's an actual kick.\\
57 - (panting)\\
58 - What are you doing?\\
59 - I felt a kick.\\
60 - There's a baby in there.\\
61 - Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.\\
62 - Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant.\\
63 - I just... never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.\\
64 - Which MIT did you go to?\\
65 - (chuckles)\\
66 - Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house!\\
67 - We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers.\\
68 - We're not baby-proofed.\\
69 - Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!\\
70 - Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.\\
71 - Do we?\\
72 - Look at you.\\
73 - Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.\\
74 - The next person kicking you will be me.\\
75 - Good night.\\
76 - (sighs)\\
77 - (sighs)\\
78 - Are we even in a good school...?\\
79 - Ow!\\
80 - I warned you, and I did it.\\
81 - What's all this?\\
82 - Oh, everything we need for your autograph session-- head shots, markers.\\
83 - Okay.\\
84 - Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this, but it'll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.\\
85 - Are you kidding?\\
86 - I once paid $20 for Theo Sassler's signature.\\
87 - Who's that?\\
88 - Oh, I don't even know.\\
89 - I just liked his name. Theo Sassler!\\
90 - Oh, and look at this.\\
91 - I even got a change maker.\\
92 - How much change you want, little lady?\\
93 - Oh, there's so much I want to change.\\
94 - Yeah, well, if it's a dollar, you're in luck.\\
95 - What's going on here?\\
96 - You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly.\\
97 - So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.\\
98 - Well, that's so nice.\\
99 - Who's coming?\\
100 - Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.\\
101 - You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?\\
102 - Yes.\\
103 - Oh, fun story: she grew up with ten siblings.\\
104 - Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.\\
105 - That's an odd mix of people.\\
106 - Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run.\\
107 - You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.\\
108 - You never went into that haunted house.\\
109 - You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.\\
110 - Well, thank you, Sheldon.\\
111 - This is a fun surprise.\\
112 - Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I'm great at surprises.\\
113 - Well, that's not a surprise at all.\\
114 - I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised.\\
115 - But as it is, I didn't know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.\\
116 - Don't get me all randy. Guests are on the way.\\
117 - Hi.\\
118 - Hey, where you been?\\
119 - Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.\\
120 - Wait till you see the crib we found.\\
121 - You bought a crib without me?\\
122 - You're gonna love it.\\
123 - Yeah.\\
124 - It's the highest rated one on the market.\\
125 - I wouldn't even call it a crib.\\
126 - I'd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.\\
127 - Sounds expensive.\\
128 - Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can't put a price on safety.\\
129 - Though if you did, it's more zeroes than you're expecting.\\
130 - But it's the safest crib you can buy.\\
131 - And if you don't like it, we can return it.\\
132 - Fine.\\
133 - In our new minivan.\\
134 - Hey, what's for lunch?\\
135 - You bought a minivan?!\\
136 - It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.\\
137 - The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.\\
138 - Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.\\
139 - I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.\\
140 - The guy at the dealership said they're not just for moms anymore.\\
141 - Then again, he did think you were my husband.\\
142 - They thought it at the ultrasound.\\
143 - Why not at the car dealership?\\
144 - Never been on this side of the table before.\\
145 - I feel powerful.\\
146 - Really?\\
147 - I feel like I'm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.\\
148 - Okay, so it's $4.75 for a signed black-and-white and $9.95 for a color.\\
149 - Right. Why not five and ten bucks?\\
150 - Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it.\\
151 - Hey, that guy's looking over here.\\
152 - Oh. You think he's your first autograph?\\
153 - I don't know. Be cool. He's coming. He's coming.\\
154 - Hi!\\
155 - Hi.\\
156 - I love your movie.\\
157 - Well, thanks.\\
158 - It has got to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.\\
159 - Your love confuses me.\\
160 - Would you like an autograph?\\
161 - Sure.\\
162 - Okay. Who do I make it out to?\\
163 - Daniel.\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - I have to ask.\\
166 - Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress?\\
167 - That did not clear things up.\\
168 - That'll be $4.75.\\
169 - Keep the change.\\
170 - But I... Oh.\\
171 - Nothing about that was good.\\
172 - Mm-mm.\\
173 - There's nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.\\
174 - The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour.\\
175 - If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.\\
176 - Been 15 minutes. Just sayin'.\\
177 - Okay. I can do this.\\
178 - Just give me a moment...\\
179 - (cork pops, Sheldon shrieks)\\
180 - Oh!\\
181 - Mimosas coming up.\\
182 - I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.\\
183 - How old was it?\\
184 - It's hard to say.\\
185 - I don't remember much after I drank it.\\
186 - Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?\\
187 - Yes. Drink is fun and good friends-- Applebee's.\\
188 - She's learning English from TV.\\
189 - TV, good. Now back to you.\\
190 - (knock on door)\\
191 - Hey, guys.\\
192 - Hi, Stuart.\\
193 - These are for you.\\
194 - Oh, they're pretty.\\
195 - Thank you.\\
196 - Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.\\
197 - Nice to meet you.\\
198 - Hello.\\
199 - Hey.\\
200 - So, what did I miss?\\
201 - Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.\\
202 - 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.\\
203 - Anybody else coming to this thing? Uh...\\
204 - What's your name? Okay.\\
205 - Jeff.\\
206 - Okay.\\
207 - My favorite part is your shower scene.\\
208 - Been hearing that a lot today. (clears throat)\\
209 - I even have a screen grab on my phone.\\
210 - Yep, there they are.\\
211 - Okay, let's keep it moving.\\
212 - Here you go. (chuckles)\\
213 - Should've punched that guy.\\
214 - Well, go ahead. He's right over there.\\
215 - Why do you do that?\\
216 - Can't you let me have my moment?\\
217 - Hello.\\
218 - Hi.\\
219 - I like your movies.\\
220 - Thank you!\\
221 - I saw both of them.\\
222 - I assume we're still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.\\
223 - You think I could get a picture of us?\\
224 - Oh, sure.\\
225 - And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?\\
226 - No. She cannot kiss...\\
227 - What is wrong with you people?!\\
228 - Leonard...\\
229 - No, no, no. It's not okay.\\
230 - Who are you?\\
231 - I'm her husband.\\
232 - No, you're not.\\
233 - I am.\\
234 - Yeah, he really is.\\
235 - No.\\
236 - It's got a rearview camera, there's a DVD player-- oh, and check this out.\\
237 - It's like we're living in the future!\\
238 - Hey, show her the trunk! Show her the trunk!\\
239 - Imagine this: you've got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you're thinking, "How am I gonna open this trunk?"\\
240 - I'm probably thinking, "Where's my husband, and why isn't he helping me?"\\
241 - You don't need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.\\
242 - No, it's a gentle kick; you're doing it wrong.\\
243 - Here. Give me those.\\
244 - Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?\\
245 - It's weird that guy thought you were a couple.\\
246 - Yes! Yes!\\
247 - (chuckles) See?\\
248 - Easy. And look at all this cargo space.\\
249 - You know, we'll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive.\\
250 - I'm telling you, this van is gonna be...\\
251 - (yelps)\\
252 - (whimpering)\\
253 - Oh, is it your back?\\
254 - Uh... yeah.\\
255 - (panting)\\
256 - Anyway, let's just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.\\
257 - So until Amy's apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.\\
258 - I lived with my old girlfriend.\\
259 - She was a geologist, too.\\
260 - Things didn't work out?\\
261 - I came home from work one day and she had taken everything.\\
262 - I'm warning you, hide your good rocks.\\
263 - My sister's husband took all her things, too.\\
264 - Story at 11:00.\\
265 - Really, no one else is coming?\\
266 - Oh, this is it.\\
267 - You are the practice round.\\
268 - Practice round? For-for what?\\
269 - Uh, no. He-he just means that you were the first people we thought of.\\
270 - Sheldon: You know, exactly.\\
271 - We've never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.\\
272 - So, I'm like a lab rat before your real friends come over?\\
273 - Oh.\\
274 - You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry.\\
275 - Help me out here. This is not where I shine.\\
276 - Stuart, you know you're one of our favorite people.\\
277 - Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false.\\
278 - I'm glad we did this test run.\\
279 - These brunches are wild!\\
280 - But how did you get her to go out with you?\\
281 - Well, she moved in across the hall.\\
282 - And he started to slowly wear me down.\\
283 - Mm-hmm.\\
284 - Like a river carves a canyon.\\
285 - Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokémon cards.\\
286 - Ready to go?\\
287 - Hang on. This guy's telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.\\
288 - This guy?\\
289 - But he's wearing a change maker.\\
290 - I think it's hot.\\
291 - That's right.\\
292 - I'm her change daddy.\\
293 - (groans)\\
294 - What was I thinking?\\
295 - Wolowitzes are not a lifting people!\\
296 - We tip the lifting people!\\
297 - (panting)\\
298 - Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room?\\
299 - They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.\\
300 - You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair.\\
301 - (panting)\\
302 - Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.\\
303 - Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.\\
304 - You're right. It sells itself.\\
305 - You have to admit, it's a pretty smooth ride.\\
306 - I was hoping it'd be quieter.\\
307 - If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed!\\
308 - Are we there yet?!\\
309 - Soon.\\
310 - Why is it taking so long?!\\
311 - H-Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen.\\
312 - I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favorite!\\
313 - I'm in too much pain (Batman music playing) to watch cartoo...\\
314 - Oh! This is a good one.\\
315 - I've been babysitting him way longer than you have.\\
316 - Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.\\
317 - This is the best blintz I've ever had.\\
318 - Oh. Thank you.\\
319 - It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.\\
320 - You know what, I-I think I'm just gonna go.\\
321 - No, Stuart, don't.\\
322 - No, I-I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I'm not even sure you think of me as a friend.\\
323 - You have any idea how that feels?\\
324 - We're so sorry.\\
325 - I'm always the last one anybody thinks of.\\
326 - Well, no, that's not true.\\
327 - I mean, sometimes it's Koothrappali.\\
328 - But we're not supposed to say that 'cause he's a minority.\\
329 - Bye.\\
330 - (stammers) Stuart, wait.\\
331 - I do know what it feels like to be left out.\\
332 - I know how it feels, too.\\
333 - All right, this is about me and him; you're not part of it.\\
334 - Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable.\\
335 - Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.\\
336 - Thank you.\\
337 - You know, in fact, I'd like to propose a toast.\\
338 - To Stuart.\\
339 - A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.\\
340 - Hear, hear.\\
341 - Cheers.\\
342 - Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.\\
343 - And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.\\
344 - (chuckles): Oh. Whoa.\\
345 - I didn't know you can propose to the same person so many times.\\
346 - The third time, I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.\\
347 - You know, once, I proposed to him.\\
348 - Yeah. I said no.\\
349 - Why?\\
350 - I just wanted to make her work for it.\\
351 - Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.\\
352 - Hang on. Is she just with you because you're rich?\\
353 - She makes more money than I do!\\
354 - (laughing): What?! Who are you?!\\
355 - (slurring): Do you know what else I love about you?\\
356 - Hmm?\\
357 - Y-Your handwriting is impeccable!\\
358 - (slurring): Thank you for noticing!\\
359 - No, I mean it. I mean it.\\
360 - It's like you have the soul of a label maker.\\
361 - You know what I love about you?\\
362 - Hmm?\\
363 - You never leave the house without a paper clip!\\
364 - You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.\\
365 - I also love how you never use swear words.\\
366 - You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without 'em.\\
367 - Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.\\
368 - Oh, calm down.\\
369 - I already put away five of these!\\
370 - (laughs) You see?\\
371 - No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss.
\subsection {Episode 07: The Veracity Elasticity}
1 - Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\\
2 - And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.\\
3 - And welcome to the first "on location" episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present:\\
4 - Both: Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags.\\
5 - Hit it.\\
6 - (keyboard intro)\\
7 - (guitar and keyboard play)\\
8 -  For joy and fun \\
9 -  There's no better manner \\
10 -  Than to fly a pennant \\
11 -  Flag or banner \\
12 - Koothrappali:  What fills my heart \\
13 -  And makes my eyes moist \\
14 -  Sending a flag \\
15 -  Up a pole on a hoist \\
16 - Both:  Fun with flags \\
17 -  Fun with flags \\
18 -  Oh! Say can you see \\
19 -  It's fun with flags \\
20 - Both:  Fun with flags. \\
21 - As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band.\\
22 - (plays keyboard solo)\\
23 - Who haven't learned their place yet.\\
24 - We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.\\
25 - Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged.\\
26 - This is our friend Penny's place.\\
27 - You may remember her from our episode "Flags: And the People Who Don't Understand Them."\\
28 - So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions coming together as one.\\
29 - Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.\\
30 - So, let's roll up our "sleevis" and get to know Nevis.\\
31 - (rimshot)\\
32 - Well, I-I like that, but next time check with me.\\
33 - Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis...\\
34 - I can't believe I'm saying this, but can we watch the news or something?\\
35 - It's cute, they're having fun living together.\\
36 - Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do when her apartment's ready.\\
37 - Actually, it's been ready for weeks.\\
38 - What do you mean?\\
39 - Well, they finished the work early, but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.\\
40 - So, she's just been lying to him?\\
41 - Well, you've lied to Sheldon.\\
42 - Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay.\\
43 - Buda and Pest united to form Budapest.\\
44 - And that's why Budapest "Budabest."\\
45 - Now.\\
46 - Oh, right.\\
47 - (rimshot)\\
48 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
49 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
50 -  The Earth began to cool \\
51 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
52 -  We built the Wall \\
53 -  We built the pyramids \\
54 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
55 -  That all started with a big bang \\
56 -  Bang! \\
57 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x07 \\
58 - The Veracity Elasticity\\
59 - Thank you for your services, gentlemen.\\
60 - Now, I'm hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music.\\
61 - (chuckling): Aw, you think you have an audience, that's funny.\\
62 - We don't get paid? Nothing?\\
63 - Not even a sandwich?\\
64 - It's almost dinner time.\\
65 - You in the mood for anything?\\
66 - Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress.\\
67 - Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.\\
68 - So?\\
69 - Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?\\
70 - I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.\\
71 - Anyway, how about dinner?\\
72 - You know, if you'd like, I could call your landlord and complain.\\
73 - Thanks, but you don't have to.\\
74 - Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good at complaining.\\
75 - If it were an Olympic sport, I'd complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold.\\
76 - Good stuff.\\
77 - So, uh, what about dinner?\\
78 - Is it me or are you purposely changing the subject?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word "subject" the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?\\
81 - I have a feeling you're still doing it.\\
82 - But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.\\
83 - I'm serious, JPL's actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.\\
84 - So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?\\
85 - If we're all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?\\
86 - You're awful quiet, everything okay?\\
87 - I'm concerned about Amy.\\
88 - She's acting a bit odd lately.\\
89 - Oh. Well, j-just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?\\
90 - (laughter)\\
91 - Her behavior.\\
92 - No, I have the feeling that she's hiding something.\\
93 - I wouldn't worry about it.\\
94 - She's probably just distracted by work.\\
95 - Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me.\\
96 - And I can't eat, I can't sleep.\\
97 - And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.\\
98 - You heard him, guys, don't ask.\\
99 - Why would she keep something from me, you know?\\
100 - I shared my body with that woman.\\
101 - And my Netflix password.\\
102 - They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.\\
103 - Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just... she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago.\\
104 - I don't understand.\\
105 - She's enjoying living with you and she didn't want it to end early.\\
106 - So, she's deceiving me in order to spend more time with me.\\
107 - Yes.\\
108 - Oh.\\
109 - Well, I feel both flattered and hurt.\\
110 - Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.\\
111 - Oh my God, that's who you look like.\\
112 - Sheldon, this is not a big deal.\\
113 - It's a little white lie, everyone does it.\\
114 - Koothrappali: Not me, I'm a 100% honest in all of my relationships.\\
115 - And how single are you right now?\\
116 - Eating-cake-on-the-toilet single.\\
117 - Well, I won't tolerate deception in my relationship.\\
118 - I have no choice but to confront her.\\
119 - Don't do that, you've got gold here.\\
120 - Hang onto it until you're in trouble and then... throw it in her face.\\
121 - Leonard: What?\\
122 - Why would you tell him that?\\
123 - That's terrible advice.\\
124 - So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?\\
125 - Well, of course not.\\
126 - So, if I actually know something right now... and I do...\\
127 - ...you don't want me to tell you?\\
128 - Uh...\\
129 - Pfft, no.\\
130 - I'll take that as a "Yes."\\
131 - She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven't noticed.\\
132 - Are you kidding me?\\
133 - See, I've known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.\\
134 - Superman's gone, my stormtrooper's gone.\\
135 - Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone.\\
136 - I'd say "damn it" in Klingon, but that wasn't until next month.\\
137 - It's "khoo-vakh."\\
138 - Khoo-vakh!\\
139 - She took my Where's Waldo.\\
140 - Well, no, no, he's over there.\\
141 - Oh, yeah, there he is.\\
142 - So, what's the deal with your apartment?\\
143 - Why's it taking so long?\\
144 - Um, it was a drywall problem.\\
145 - Oh, no, what happened?\\
146 - Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it's really more...\\
147 - Wet wall?\\
148 - Or damp wall, just as bad.\\
149 - Mm.\\
150 - So why don't they just get more drywall?\\
151 - Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings...\\
152 - Okay, are you done?\\
153 - Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.\\
154 - I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn't let it go.\\
155 - But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?\\
156 - Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower.\\
157 - Please don't say anything, I feel terrible about this.\\
158 - Oh, don't worry, I won't.\\
159 - Thanks.\\
160 - "The woman at the wall store?" Let it go!\\
161 - Are you going to confront Penny?\\
162 - Eventually, I guess.\\
163 - Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.\\
164 - Hmm.\\
165 - You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs.\\
166 - Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.\\
167 - Oh, my God, I'm going blind.\\
168 - Hi.\\
169 - Food's here.\\
170 - Oh.\\
171 - Excellent.\\
172 - I'm very hungry.\\
173 - Yeah, speaking of which, what's going on with your apartment?\\
174 - Oh, uh, they're still working on it.\\
175 - Interesting.\\
176 - Very interesting.\\
177 - Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and they're gonna be fixing it for a while.\\
178 - Wait, uh... you saw her apartment?\\
179 - I did, still a mess.\\
180 - Leonard?\\
181 - Yeah?\\
182 - W-Why are you speaking Klingon?\\
183 - Why are you speaking English?\\
184 - This is ridiculous.\\
185 - Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?\\
186 - (speaks Ubbi Dubbi)\\
187 - (speaking Ubbi Dubbi)\\
188 - Oh, wait, stop that.\\
189 - You stop that.\\
190 - (speaks Klingon)\\
191 - (speaks Klingon)\\
192 - Penny: Okay.\\
193 - That's enough.\\
194 - You know what?\\
195 - What is going on?\\
196 - Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished, but then you just said it's not, so now I'm all confused.\\
197 - Penny was just covering for me.\\
198 - My place has been ready for two weeks.\\
199 - How could you lie to me?\\
200 - Uh, she's enjoyed living with you.\\
201 - It's called being in love.\\
202 - Mm-hmm, and what's it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband's stuff?\\
203 - Wha... That is not true!\\
204 - Wh-wh-wh... Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me.\\
205 - Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!\\
206 - Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife and your own eyes over me?\\
207 - Wow.\\
208 - You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing?\\
209 - Uh, did you notice your key chain?\\
210 - Where's Batman?!\\
211 - Hey.\\
212 - Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard's things?\\
213 - One sec.\\
214 - Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?!\\
215 - It just came up because we-we were talking about secrets and...\\
216 - Wait.\\
217 - (speaks Klingon)\\
218 - Everybody stop it with that!\\
219 - I'm not really a part of this, so I'm just gonna dig in.\\
220 - And I'd like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.\\
221 - You're up, blabby.\\
222 - Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.\\
223 - I guess it's okay.\\
224 - I'm sorry that I lied about my apartment.\\
225 - It's all right.\\
226 - And...\\
227 - And what?\\
228 - Your wizard robes are next to go.\\
229 - Now that everything's out on the table, you-you think you two will keep living together?\\
230 - Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.\\
231 - Are you saying you'd like to live with me?\\
232 - I'm open to the possibility.\\
233 - (gasps)\\
234 - (speaks Ubbi Dubbi)\\
235 - Whatever.\\
236 - You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don't like in Sheldon's old room.\\
237 - Solves everything. That's a great idea!\\
238 - Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.\\
239 - That would be amazing.\\
240 - Wait, wait, hold on, do what?\\
241 - Excuse me... that's my room.\\
242 - But you won't be living here.\\
243 - But that's my room.\\
244 - But you won't be living here.\\
245 - But that's my room.\\
246 - You guys might want to start eating.\\
247 - But you won't be living here.\\
248 - Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.\\
249 - But that's my room.\\
250 - All: But you won't be living here!\\
251 - Thank you for understanding.\\
252 - Hey, I get it.\\
253 - Everybody wants to spend more time with me.\\
254 - I'm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.\\
255 - Good night.\\
256 - Mm, night.\\
257 - (smooches)\\
258 - If we did continue living together, would it be here?\\
259 - I don't know.\\
260 - It-It could be.\\
261 - Of course there's... there's always your apartment.\\
262 - S-Sure, sure, we-we could live in my apartment.\\
263 - I hate your apartment.\\
264 - Sorry, you brought it up?\\
265 - Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place.\\
266 - You know, and, technically, we don't even have to stay in Pasadena.\\
267 - We could, we could move to Altadena... or a place that doesn't even end in "Dena."\\
268 - It's kind of exciting.\\
269 - I mean... we could do whatever we want.\\
270 - But what if we move and we don't like it?\\
271 - What if there's a smoker in the building?\\
272 - Or pets?\\
273 - Or there could be mold.\\
274 - There could be traffic noise.\\
275 - (humming "Theme from Star Trek")\\
276 - I'm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route.\\
277 - (humming "Theme from Star Trek")\\
278 - (stops humming)\\
279 - Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?\\
280 - Yes.\\
281 - I'm not a child, don't do that.\\
282 - Sorry.\\
283 - Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey?\\
284 - (humming "Also sprach Zarathustra")\\
285 - All right, now that's soothing.\\
286 - (continues humming "Also sprach Zarathustra")\\
287 - Look, I-I get it, this is still my room; we haven't really made it yours.\\
288 - Thank you.\\
289 - Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger.\\
290 - Put it anywhere you like.\\
291 - Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.\\
292 - I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here.\\
293 - Decorate it any way that makes you happy.\\
294 - Do you really mean that?\\
295 - I really do.\\
296 - Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid of all your stuff.\\
297 - Yeah? What are you keeping?\\
298 - That candle and you.\\
299 - What about my robot poster?\\
300 - Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.\\
301 - I can make do with just the candle.\\
302 - What's going on?\\
303 - I'm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.\\
304 - Can it be more of an internal struggle?\\
305 - I need to see it.\\
306 - While I'm gone, don't breathe on my pillow.\\
307 - How about if I just don't breathe at all?\\
308 - That's my girl.\\
309 - (dance music playing)\\
310 - What on earth?\\
311 - What is going on?!\\
312 - Oh, hey, Sheldon.\\
313 - We turned your room into a s*x dungeon.\\
314 - Oh!\\
315 - No!\\
316 - What is happening?!\\
317 - Okay, last question.\\
318 - The chaps he was wearing... assless?\\
319 - Can we just focus on the decision I'm facing?\\
320 - We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.\\
321 - Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision.\\
322 - Now, do Amy and I continue living together?\\
323 - Or do I move back in with Leonard?\\
324 - Over my assless chaps you will.\\
325 - This isn't complicated.\\
326 - Do you love Amy?\\
327 - Yes.\\
328 - Do you like living with her?\\
329 - Yes.\\
330 - Do you know what you need to do now?\\
331 - Apparently, figure this out on my own 'cause you guys are no help at all.\\
332 - Hi.\\
333 - Hello.\\
334 - What are you doing?\\
335 - I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.\\
336 - I understand.\\
337 - I'll leave you be.\\
338 - What, you're familiar with the reference?\\
339 - Of course.\\
340 - Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralyzed by indecision and would starve to death.\\
341 - Exactly.\\
342 - Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so...\\
343 - ...here's an eggplant.\\
344 - Thank you.\\
345 - You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.\\
346 - Really?\\
347 - Although, in Aristotle's example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.\\
348 - Huh.\\
349 - Yeah, I wonder if that's related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.\\
350 - Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian?\\
351 - 'Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.\\
352 - Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?\\
353 - Boy, you think you know a guy.\\
354 - Okay.\\
355 - Open your eyes and see your new room.\\
356 - Wow.\\
357 - I-I know I went a little overboard.\\
358 - We can always dial it back.\\
359 - No, no, no, no, no, it's-it's important to me that you have the bedroom you want.\\
360 - Oh, that means so much. I love you.\\
361 - I love you, too.\\
362 - (smooches)\\
363 - Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don't tell Penny.
\subsection {Episode 08: The Brain Bowl Incubation}
1 - How much will it hurt?\\
2 - It's just a tiny skin sample.\\
3 - You saw me do it to myself.\\
4 - On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off.\\
5 - A two.\\
6 - Eating a whole Altoid?\\
7 - Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them.\\
8 - Now, I've done this dozens of times, but if you're too scared you don't have to.\\
9 - No, this is for science.\\
10 - I can be brave for science.\\
11 - Thank you.\\
12 - Oh, jiminy, that's cold!\\
13 - Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks when I've converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.\\
14 - All right, just warn me before you do it.\\
15 - Okay.\\
16 - Three... two... and we're done.\\
17 - You tricked me.\\
18 - You didn't say one.\\
19 - It didn't hurt, did it?\\
20 - No... but “three, two and we're done” is incomplete.\\
21 - You know those things bother me.\\
22 - It's like hearing “da-da-da-da-da-dah” without yelling...\\
23 - Okay, fine, one.\\
24 - Thank you.\\
25 - Now yell “Charge” and we can get out of here.\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
27 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
28 -  The Earth began to cool \\
29 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
30 -  We built the Wall \\
31 -  We built the pyramids \\
32 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
33 -  That all started with a big bang \\
34 -  Bang! \\
35 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x08 \\
36 - The Brain Bowl Incubation\\
37 - Oh, my God, I just got it.\\
38 - Fun onions...\\
39 - Funyuns.\\
40 - (laughs)\\
41 - Hold on.\\
42 - Is that a wobble?\\
43 - Yes.\\
44 - That's definitely a gravitational wobble.\\
45 - Uh, sorry, I could come back.\\
46 - Oh, no, it's okay.\\
47 - I-I just found a wobble.\\
48 - Oh, do I need a mop?\\
49 - It's a gravitational wobble.\\
50 - It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.\\
51 - Oh... well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh?\\
52 - Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.\\
53 - What is your name?\\
54 - Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.\\
55 - You think it would be more difficult than that?\\
56 - Good point.\\
57 - And you are?\\
58 - Oh, uh, Issabella Maria Concepcion.\\
59 - Oh, well, nice to meet you.\\
60 - Nice to meet you, too.\\
61 - You know, I have to say, based on the candy wrappers and the bags of junk food I see in this trash, I thought the person working here was ten years old.\\
62 - Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.\\
63 - Bueno, um, I'm just going to empty your waste paper basket and then I'll get out of your way.\\
64 - Oh, please, allow me.\\
65 - That's a lot of empty calories.\\
66 - Thank you.\\
67 - You're welcome.\\
68 - Okay, uh, okay, I-I-I have to go.\\
69 - Okay.\\
70 - Good luck with your, um, space exploration.\\
71 - Thank you.\\
72 - Good luck with your... future endeavors.\\
73 - Did it work?\\
74 - Are they brain cells yet?\\
75 - If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.\\
76 - Oh, just let me look.\\
77 - (gasps)\\
78 - Oh, my goodness!\\
79 - I see quivering black lines.\\
80 - Those must be neurons.\\
81 - Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.\\
82 - Those are your eyelashes, move.\\
83 - Well, Sheldon...\\
84 - I see astrocytes.\\
85 - Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.\\
86 - I have such a profound sense of creation.\\
87 - I ju... it's like when I hatched Sea-Monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like...\\
88 - Me-Monkeys.\\
89 - These cells come from both of us.\\
90 - Yeah, but Us-Monkeys doesn't pop.\\
91 - Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!\\
92 - We-Monkeys, there you go.\\
93 - Hey.\\
94 - When can we start running tests on it?\\
95 - No reason we can't start right now.\\
96 - What stimulus should we introduce it to first?\\
97 - L-Light, sound, temperature...\\
98 - Oh! Oh! Let's expose it to images of me and you and see who it likes better.\\
99 - Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons.\\
100 - I mean, it's remarkable, but it's still limited in what it can do.\\
101 - I understand.\\
102 - She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.\\
103 - Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.\\
104 - Oh, no, that's mine.\\
105 - Really?\\
106 - The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.\\
107 - Well, I can't eat like a ten-year-old all the time.\\
108 - You're dating somebody, who is it?\\
109 - What?\\
110 - What are you talking about?\\
111 - You only watch what you eat when you're afraid you might have to take your shirt off.\\
112 - No, she's right.\\
113 - As long as I've known you, you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.\\
114 - It's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.\\
115 - All right, fine, don't tell us.\\
116 - There's nothing to tell.\\
117 - All right.\\
118 - How's that broccoli?\\
119 - It's gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.\\
120 - Bam.\\
121 - Thank you.\\
122 - What's her name?\\
123 - Issabella.\\
124 - Oh, did you meet her at work?\\
125 - Yes, in the telescope room.\\
126 - Oh, so she's an astronomer?\\
127 - Yes... which is why she was in the telescope room.\\
128 - Yes, this is all making sense.\\
129 - Good.\\
130 - Well, that's great, Raj.\\
131 - You must have so much in common.\\
132 - Mm-hmm.\\
133 - So, when do we meet her?\\
134 - No, no, this is brand-new.\\
135 - We haven't even been on a proper date yet.\\
136 - Okay, well, good luck with it.\\
137 - Thank you.\\
138 - How come you never eat broccoli?\\
139 - I'm married, I don't have to be attractive.\\
140 - You know, most people don't realize this technique has actually been around for a few years.\\
141 - Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.\\
142 - Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so sky's the limit.\\
143 - Look, look... here I am standing next to the incubator.\\
144 - Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.\\
145 - Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.\\
146 - Oh.\\
147 - Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.\\
148 - I'm running out of ways to act excited.\\
149 - So, enough about us, how are things going with you?\\
150 - Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.\\
151 - Good, you know, in case the exit isn't clearly marked.\\
152 - Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who's on the same journey.\\
153 - Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste.\\
154 - Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?\\
155 - Well, I didn't make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it.\\
156 - You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.\\
157 - Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise.\\
158 - Mine has a fully developed immune system.\\
159 - Ours doesn't need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.\\
160 - Sheldon, that's enough.\\
161 - Oh, yeah, no, fine.\\
162 - Let's just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them.\\
163 - Although, we didn't need to have s*x with Howard for ours, so we win.\\
164 - Koothrappali: This is fun.\\
165 - I have never cleaned a toilet before.\\
166 - You're kidding.\\
167 - No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady...\\
168 - ...who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for.\\
169 - It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.\\
170 - Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair.\\
171 - I think that's called a mommy.\\
172 - Uh...\\
173 - So, forgive me... forgive me for being nosy, but is-is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?\\
174 - No, not for many years.\\
175 - Oh, so, you are unencumbered?\\
176 - Just me and my son.\\
177 - I love kids, how old is he?\\
178 - Nineteen.\\
179 - That's a cute age.\\
180 - They can do so many things.\\
181 - He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.\\
182 - That's wonderful.\\
183 - A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.\\
184 - Look at that, we have something in common.\\
185 - Yeah, I guess we do.\\
186 - Maybe there are other things we have in common.\\
187 - C-Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?\\
188 - Ay, Rajesh, I think you're very sweet, but (sighs)\\
189 - I work two jobs and I don't have time for dating.\\
190 - Yeah, sure. I understand.\\
191 - Yeah, I'm very busy, too.\\
192 - Oh, please don't take it personal, I think you're a very nice man.\\
193 - I think you're very nice as well.\\
194 - Thank you for helping me.\\
195 - Good night, Rajesh.\\
196 - Oh, yes. Oh, okay.\\
197 - Uh...\\
198 - Good night.\\
199 - I don't know, maybe it's the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us.\\
200 - (chuckles) Good night, Rajesh.\\
201 - Okay. I'll leave.\\
202 - But just know, every time I come in here, I'll be thinking of you.\\
203 - Would you look at that?\\
204 - The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it.\\
205 - I've never seen results like this before.\\
206 - Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home; this is going right on the fridge.\\
207 - Aren't you glad you participated in this?\\
208 - Oh, I am.\\
209 - And you realize what the next step is?\\
210 - (sighs) Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.\\
211 - Uh, no.\\
212 - We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.\\
213 - Make a baby? What are you talking about?\\
214 - Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.\\
215 - Eh... Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind.\\
216 - We... we'll be able to get into any preschool we want!\\
217 - Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.\\
218 - Oh, yes, you are! I track your cycle.\\
219 - For the next 36 hours you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.\\
220 - Wow. I-I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.\\
221 - I don't understand.\\
222 - I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me.\\
223 - Not right now.\\
224 - Oh, I see what's happening here. You're playing hard to get.\\
225 - I'm not playing anything.\\
226 - We're not making a baby today.\\
227 - Very well.\\
228 - Oops, how clumsy of me.\\
229 - You know what? Let me get that.\\
230 - Hey.\\
231 - Where are you going?\\
232 - I...\\
233 - Did you even look at my bottom?\\
234 - Welcome.\\
235 - What is this?\\
236 - Oh, well, you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.\\
237 - Oh, Rajesh... Oh, come on!\\
238 - We're in the telescope room!\\
239 - It'll be like dining under the stars.\\
240 - Y-You see this, uh, double zero?\\
241 - When it says “01,” that means it's twinkling.\\
242 - Sometimes it takes a while.\\
243 - Rajesh, this is so sweet, but you... you know I'm working.\\
244 - That's why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.\\
245 - Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.\\
246 - Oh, please sit! (chuckles)\\
247 - I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.\\
248 - Oh, really?\\
249 - You made Cuban food?\\
250 - That depends-- do they have Mexican food in Cuba?\\
251 - Now, when he said “make a baby”" is it possible he meant out of Legos?\\
252 - No. He was explicit.\\
253 - Needlessly and freakishly explicit.\\
254 - Leonard: Why does he need a baby?\\
255 - He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.\\
256 - Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?\\
257 - Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesn't guarantee anything.\\
258 - That's true. Sheldon's father once picked a fight with a cactus.\\
259 - Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.\\
260 - We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.\\
261 - Leonard: Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.\\
262 - Hey, you're talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours.\\
263 - Aw, man.\\
264 - Penny: Ooh!\\
265 - Sheldon gonna get some.\\
266 - Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's behind door number two.\\
267 - (Leonard chuckling)\\
268 - (jazz music playing)\\
269 - Well, hello.\\
270 - Hello.\\
271 - Would you care for a brandy?\\
272 - I don't think so.\\
273 - Good choice, it's disgusting.\\
274 - Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.\\
275 - Who's trying to seduce you?\\
276 - After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.\\
277 - I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.\\
278 - Anything you'd like to pet?\\
279 - Not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.\\
280 - Okay, I've had enough.\\
281 - (stammers)\\
282 - Amy, come back.\\
283 - I don't know how to open the oysters.\\
284 - So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?\\
285 - Well, I suppose how much people care about Oprah's favorite things.\\
286 - I thought that, too.\\
287 - But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again.\\
288 - You know, I do have some time off this Sunday if you'd like to...\\
289 - Wolowitz: Hey! I saw your car...\\
290 - Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?\\
291 - Uh...\\
292 - It's okay.\\
293 - Uh, I should get back to work.\\
294 - Hi. Howard Wolowitz.\\
295 - Oh. Issabella Concepcion.\\
296 - Oh, yeah, the astronomer.\\
297 - Raj told us about you.\\
298 - Hey! Free toilet paper!\\
299 - You told him I was an astronomer?\\
300 - Uh...\\
301 - I understand.\\
302 - Time to go.\\
303 - No, p-please don't.\\
304 - It's okay, Rajesh, I'm a grown woman.\\
305 - I don't have to waste my time with someone who's embarrassed by me.\\
306 - I can keep this, right?\\
307 - Issabella!\\
308 - Issabella, wait, wait, let me explain.\\
309 - If you are embarrassed by what I do, why did you pursue me?\\
310 - I'm sorry.\\
311 - Honestly, I-I didn't think your job would bother me, but I guess it did.\\
312 - And I hate myself for that.\\
313 - But there's a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you.\\
314 - I doubt that.\\
315 - Well, prepare to be mortified.\\
316 - I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do.\\
317 - Also, I know they're pretty, but I'm scared of butterflies.\\
318 - Sorry, just passing through.\\
319 - I think this fell off your cart.\\
320 - Come on. What do you say?\\
321 - Let me make it up to you.\\
322 - You're very persistent.\\
323 - It's my one move.\\
324 - Okay.\\
325 - This Sunday night, you may take me to dinner at a nice restaurant.\\
326 - Great. Where would you like to go?\\
327 - Your choice.\\
328 - It can be Pakistani food, if you like.\\
329 - Excuse me, but I'm Indian.\\
330 - And now you know how it feels.\\
331 - So, were you turned on even a little bit?\\
332 - It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.\\
333 - I'm sorry, is that a yes?\\
334 - No!\\
335 - Amy, I didn't want it to come to this.\\
336 - But you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man.\\
337 - (Spanish music playing)\\
338 - The flamenco.\\
339 - (snapping, slapping continues)\\
340 - For God's sake, you're ridiculous.\\
341 - You guys are aroused, right?\\
342 - (pants) That was a close one.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Geology Elevation}
1 - Thank you very much. Thanks.\\
2 - Leonard: That is unbelievable.\\
3 - Good for Bert.\\
4 - Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant.\\
5 - Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.\\
6 - Everything is stupid and I want to go home.\\
7 - That's Sheldon's way of saying he's proud of Bert, too.\\
8 - Ah.\\
9 - Hey, it's not even called the "Genius Grant," it's the MacArthur Fellowship.\\
10 - Just like it's not Frankenstein, it's "Frankenstein's Monster."\\
11 - Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there.\\
12 - And if anyone's a genius, it's me for the way I brought that full circle.\\
13 - How much money did he win?\\
14 - Over half a million dollars.\\
15 - Wow.\\
16 - And he doesn't have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it.\\
17 - Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under.\\
18 - Here he comes.\\
19 - Right.\\
20 - Be polite.\\
21 - I know how to behave.\\
22 - Do you?\\
23 - Hey, congratulations Bert!\\
24 - Yeah, good for you. That's amazing.\\
25 - Thanks.\\
26 - I was as surprised as anybody.\\
27 - When they called and told me I won, I didn't believe them.\\
28 - And then they said, "No, you really won."\\
29 - And then I said, "Cool."\\
30 - Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story.\\
31 - I've gotten pretty good at telling it.\\
32 - Well, see ya.\\
33 - Some genius.\\
34 - I zinged him with sarcasm, he didn't even notice.\\
35 - I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip I've ever heard.\\
36 - Well, aren't you a peach.\\
37 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
38 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
39 -  The Earth began to cool \\
40 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
41 -  We built the Wall \\
42 -  We built the pyramids \\
43 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
44 -  That all started with a big bang \\
45 -  Bang! \\
46 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x09 \\
47 - The Geology Elevation\\
48 - Who leaves their bike in the hallway?\\
49 - You know, if I knew how to ride one, I'd steal it.\\
50 - Ignore him, he's just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant.\\
51 - Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio!\\
52 - You know, when they told him he won, he didn't believe it, but then he did believe it.\\
53 - It was so funny.\\
54 - Sheldon: Who listens to the radio anymore?\\
55 - Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.\\
56 - They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.\\
57 - You know what, I've met Bert.\\
58 - Isn't he an indicator of life on other planets?\\
59 - (chuckles)\\
60 - Sheldon: You used to make those jokes about me.\\
61 - Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert!\\
62 - You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bert's research, you'd be less bitter about him winning.\\
63 - (stammering): You want me to read a geology paper?\\
64 - Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but I'm all out of taffy.\\
65 - (knocking)\\
66 - You busy?\\
67 - There's somebody out here who wants to meet you.\\
68 - Who is it?\\
69 - Say hello to everybody's little friend-- remote control Stephen Hawking!\\
70 - Where did you get that?\\
71 - I found him in an old box.\\
72 - Why would you buy it?\\
73 - I didn't buy it.\\
74 - I made it.\\
75 - Last question.\\
76 - What is wrong with you?\\
77 - What's the big deal?\\
78 - Howie, it's in poor taste.\\
79 - No, it's not. Check it out.\\
80 - He says fun stuff.\\
81 - RC Hawking: Hey good lookin', want to go for a spin?\\
82 - His eyes also light up in the dark.\\
83 - It's always fun watching him read someone else's work.\\
84 - (scoffs)\\
85 - (moans)\\
86 - It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.\\
87 - Ye-- why?\\
88 - Eh, why?!\\
89 - Oh, that's why.\\
90 - Sounds like the night we had coitus.\\
91 - I hope you're happy making me read this.\\
92 - Bert's work is remarkable.\\
93 - And I'm more upset than ever.\\
94 - This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainer's actually entertaining.\\
95 - Sheldon, it's foolish to be angry that Bert's work has merit.\\
96 - Yeah, well I-I am angry!\\
97 - And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry!\\
98 - And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?\\
99 - Ooh, a-angry? What are you doing?\\
100 - I-I-I knew the answer. I got excited.\\
101 - Hey, buddy, why don't we go for a walk, so you can calm down.\\
102 - (sighs)\\
103 - That's a good idea.\\
104 - I guess everyone's having them now.\\
105 - Hey, I'm trying to help you.\\
106 - Fine.\\
107 - You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.\\
108 - Just wave your arms a little and they fly away, it's not...\\
109 - Okay, Raj, I'm gonna show you something.\\
110 - Now, one of us thinks it's offensive.\\
111 - The other thinks it's hilarious and a great idea.\\
112 - But, I'm not going to tell you who likes it.\\
113 - This is tough.\\
114 - But I'm going to say it's the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts.\\
115 - (laughing)\\
116 - You're crazy.\\
117 - I've worked with Hawking.\\
118 - He's got a great sense of humor.\\
119 - And I think he'd like it.\\
120 - Okay, call him and show him.\\
121 - I dare you.\\
122 - I have no problem calling him.\\
123 - Fine, then do it.\\
124 - Fine, I will.\\
125 - While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.\\
126 - What's this button do?\\
127 - Gentlemen, start your wheelchairs.\\
128 - You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.\\
129 - I laughed because the guy was Leonard.\\
130 - I admire you, Leonard.\\
131 - Really, why?\\
132 - You're happy with who you are.\\
133 - You don't get jealous of other people.\\
134 - Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river.\\
135 - I couldn't just take the compliment.\\
136 - I had to ask why.\\
137 - You know, I do understand what you're feeling.\\
138 - My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head.\\
139 - How did you deal with it?\\
140 - I wet the bed until college, but I don't think that's a quality fix.\\
141 - (groans)\\
142 - I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist.\\
143 - I mean... rocks!\\
144 - He studies rocks!\\
145 - If rock is so great, how come paper beats it?\\
146 - Leonard, I'm having a primal urge to throw this rock.\\
147 - Do it.\\
148 - Visualize it as your anger a-and-and toss it out of your life.\\
149 - Perhaps I will.\\
150 - This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions.\\
151 - I will cast you far away.\\
152 - Feel free to take out a pigeon while you're at it.\\
153 - Let it fly.\\
154 - (inhales deeply)\\
155 - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...\\
156 - What happened?\\
157 - I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot!\\
158 - Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.\\
159 - Wha--?\\
160 - And what happened to you?\\
161 - Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. It's fine.\\
162 - You know, it's one thing to be envious, but now you're injuring yourself.\\
163 - It has to stop.\\
164 - Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video.\\
165 - You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life.\\
166 - Y-You've got love, you're in good health, you've got a roof over your head.\\
167 - Yeah, but you've got all those things, and no one's lining up to be you.\\
168 - Anybody else want to try?\\
169 - I'm gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.\\
170 - Leonard: You're up.\\
171 - (Penny clears throat)\\
172 - This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off!\\
173 - Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?\\
174 - I do!\\
175 - Your life is fine, you big baby!\\
176 - Maybe you're right.\\
177 - Really?!\\
178 - If it helps, I'm questioning your life choices, too.\\
179 - Thank you, Penny.\\
180 - You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bert's success is not my failure.\\
181 - There you go.\\
182 - And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.\\
183 - There you go...\\
184 - What's up?\\
185 - I'm conducting a quick survey.\\
186 - Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?\\
187 - Yep.\\
188 - Do you think this is in poor taste?\\
189 - Does it spin around and do tricks?\\
190 - Yeah!\\
191 - Then yeah.\\
192 - What do you think?\\
193 - That is hilarious!\\
194 - Give me the remote control.\\
195 - I want to drive him into the girls' restroom.\\
196 - All right, we're done.\\
197 - It's offensive.\\
198 - Top of the afternoon, gentlemen.\\
199 - You're in a good mood.\\
200 - Well, it's a new day. I have a new outlook.\\
201 - You know, I realized I don't need to worry about other people.\\
202 - I just need to think more about myself.\\
203 - Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?\\
204 - Well, I'm glad to see you moving forward.\\
205 - Bert did quality research.\\
206 - And he deserves whatever accolades he receives.\\
207 - What is going on?\\
208 - Did you upgrade his software last night?\\
209 - I think he might be learning on his own.\\
210 - Then the robot uprising has begun.\\
211 - Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations.\\
212 - He doesn't just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him.\\
213 - Bert?\\
214 - I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved.\\
215 - Thanks. I've been hearing that a lot.\\
216 - Ever since I won, people think I'm great.\\
217 - Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too.\\
218 - You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I'm allowed to nominate someone for next year.\\
219 - Really?\\
220 - I didn't know that.\\
221 - So I was thinking, you know, engineers don't get a lot of respect.\\
222 - Is your friend Howard working on anything cool?\\
223 - You know, I-I'm not sure.\\
224 - You know, you'd have to ask him.\\
225 - Excuse me.\\
226 - Aah!\\
227 - (loud bang, thud)\\
228 - Sheldon: Leonard! I hurt myself again.\\
229 - Excuse me, I-I have to go take some pictures.\\
230 - I can't believe you head-butted a water fountain.\\
231 - No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain.\\
232 - I can't imagine you being violent.\\
233 - It's not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges.\\
234 - I'm so disappointed in myself.\\
235 - Jealousy is completely illogical.\\
236 - It's a human emotion, Sheldon.\\
237 - Everyone gets jealous.\\
238 - I'm jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships.\\
239 - What about me and Sheldon?\\
240 - Sure.\\
241 - I've always been jealous of how much money Raj's family has.\\
242 - Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money.\\
243 - Ever since I met Penny, I've been envious of her looks.\\
244 - Aw, thank you.\\
245 - That's why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.\\
246 - What?!\\
247 - You know what I mean.\\
248 - You were still hot, but more like a "why'd that hot girl cut off all her hair?" hot.\\
249 - You liked my short hair, right?\\
250 - Yeah... I loved it.\\
251 - Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject.\\
252 - Seriously, none of you liked it?\\
253 - I thought it was brave.\\
254 - Does that count as liking it?\\
255 - You know, how come nobody's talking about Howard's dopey haircut?\\
256 - I think he looks cute.\\
257 - And I think you're cute.\\
258 - I think you're both cute.\\
259 - I think I hate all of you nerds.\\
260 - Sorry I'm moving slowly.\\
261 - Oh, I don't mind.\\
262 - If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like I'm walking with my grandma.\\
263 - Oh, no.\\
264 - Did you...\\
265 - A plaque?\\
266 - Nobody wants to see this.\\
267 - Well, change "plaque" to "mixed-race couple" and you are my grandma.\\
268 - I can't take this anymore.\\
269 - Bert. Bert. Bert!\\
270 - Bert: Come in.\\
271 - All right, let's do this...\\
272 - Bert?\\
273 - We need to talk.\\
274 - What happened to you?\\
275 - Rock, rock, water fountain.\\
276 - I am not proud of this.\\
277 - But I have been envious of your recent success.\\
278 - Wow, I won the MacArthur Grant, everyone's jealous of me.\\
279 - Once I get Lasik, I'll be out of things to wish for.\\
280 - I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, I'd somehow be unburdened.\\
281 - Is it working?\\
282 - No.\\
283 - Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever.\\
284 - Well, you know, we're both pretty smart.\\
285 - I bet if we put our heads together, we could come up with a solution.\\
286 - We... Hang on.\\
287 - You're my enemy.\\
288 - Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend.\\
289 - And right now, I'm my own worst enemy.\\
290 - That makes you my fr--\\
291 - Okay, I'm good to go.\\
292 - Great.\\
293 - Now that we're friends, want to see if we can get tickets to a taping of Ellen?\\
294 - You know what? This isn't gonna work.\\
295 - Sheldon... wait.\\
296 - You know, you've got a lot to be happy about.\\
297 - You're at the top of your field, you have a great girlfriend.\\
298 - Yes! That's right!\\
299 - I have Amy!\\
300 - In the past, you've professed feelings for her.\\
301 - Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you don't?\\
302 - It used to.\\
303 - But now that I'm rich and successful, I think I can do better.\\
304 - I can't believe you punched Bert.\\
305 - I didn't punch him.\\
306 - He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop.\\
307 - I'm not even sure he knows I did it.\\
308 - Hey, Sheldon, I've got someone here who might make you feel better.\\
309 - Hello, Sheldon.\\
310 - Professor Hawking!\\
311 - Hawking: I understand you're struggling with professional jealousy.\\
312 - Thanks, Leonard, now he's not gonna think I'm cool.\\
313 - Don't worry, I know how you feel.\\
314 - I have never won a Nobel Prize.\\
315 - Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.\\
316 - It's fine.\\
317 - I've been on The Simpsons.\\
318 - How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?\\
319 - I remind myself every scientific advancement is a victory.\\
320 - Also, I was on Star Trek.\\
321 - Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac...\\
322 - You don't care.\\
323 - Don't waste your time on jealousy, Sheldon, you're too brilliant.\\
324 - How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says you're brilliant?\\
325 - I can't.\\
326 - Thank you, Professor Hawking.\\
327 - You are a gift to mankind.\\
328 - There should be statues of you everywhere.\\
329 - You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair.\\
330 - We could swap you right in.\\
331 - I always thought a motorized toy of me would be cool.\\
332 - What a wonderful idea!\\
333 - How does this man not have a Nobel?\\
334 - Do not tell Wolowitz.\\
335 - Way ahead of you.\\
336 - A new study came out, and it said that laughing makes your brain work better.\\
337 - And I know that's true because laughing has made me the "smartiest."\\
338 - (laughter)\\
339 - Although, on the other hand, babies laugh a lot, and they're dumb.\\
340 - (laughter)\\
341 - Do people know about her?\\
342 - 'Cause she's delightful.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Property Division Collision}
1 - If we're going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?\\
2 - Oh, actually, I would.\\
3 - Great, what'd you have in mind?\\
4 - Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.\\
5 - Well, how about we start a little smaller?\\
6 - Like moving the furniture around.\\
7 - You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building.\\
8 - Look, we can't just throw away Penny's stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back.\\
9 - You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork.\\
10 - Well, I'm sure she misses this one.\\
11 - I mean, it's the greatest gift I've ever given anybody.\\
12 - It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.\\
13 - It may have appreciated in value.\\
14 - The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.\\
15 - Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back.\\
16 - I can't wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.\\
17 - Look, it's the same smile she has in the painting.\\
18 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
19 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
20 -  The Earth began to cool \\
21 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
22 -  We built the Wall \\
23 -  We built the pyramids \\
24 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
25 -  That all started with a big bang \\
26 -  Bang! \\
27 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x10 \\
28 - The Property Division Collision\\
29 - Yeah-- there's hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now.\\
30 - Oh, no, no, Th-those hooks are gone.\\
31 - What happened to them?\\
32 - Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away.\\
33 - Hey, guys, what are you...?\\
34 - Oh, that's here, cool.\\
35 - Amy wants me to have it.\\
36 - Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it.\\
37 - B-But it's a picture of you.\\
38 - And you.\\
39 - But you commissioned it.\\
40 - To give to you.\\
41 - But you like it so much.\\
42 - So do you.\\
43 - I seem to be losing.\\
44 - Yes, you do.\\
45 - You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through.\\
46 - Uh, for example... who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?\\
47 - Why don't you keep it?\\
48 - That seems fair; we did just give you the painting.\\
49 - Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab myself with.\\
50 - Sheldon: Wonderful, Longclaw is mine.\\
51 - And how about you keep our... avocado plant?\\
52 - Sounds right-- a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash.\\
53 - Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift.\\
54 - Fine, take the plant.\\
55 - Oh, we got a sword and a plant; our apartment's really shaping up.\\
56 - Stuart, you didn't have to get us a baby gift.\\
57 - Oh.\\
58 - Just homemade coupons for things you might need help with before the baby gets here.\\
59 - Going to the grocery store, driving you to the doctor.\\
60 - If you're not in a hurry, I can dig you a koi pond.\\
61 - A foot massage?\\
62 - And that's not me being creepy, that's for either of you.\\
63 - This is very nice, Stuart, thank you.\\
64 - How come this one's on the back of an eviction notice?\\
65 - Oh, yeah.\\
66 - Uh, now that you mention it... can I live here?\\
67 - Stuart, we'd love to help you out, but this a bad time; we're about to have a baby.\\
68 - Or is that why this is a great time?\\
69 - Think about it-- when that baby comes, you're gonna need all the help you can get.\\
70 - Thank you, but I'm not really sure.\\
71 - Hang on, maybe it's not the worst idea.\\
72 - I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother.\\
73 - That woman didn't get heat rash once with me on powder patrol.\\
74 - Hey...\\
75 - I guess you could stay for a few days and we'll see how it goes.\\
76 - Thank you.\\
77 - And it's only temporary, just till I get back on my feet. or the baby goes off to college, whichever happens first.\\
78 - (chuckles) When would you move in?\\
79 - Well, uh, my car broke down in your driveway, so I'm gonna say now.\\
80 - But I am ready to be helpful.\\
81 - In fact...\\
82 - I'm gonna go vacuum.\\
83 - Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.\\
84 - Okay.\\
85 - Then I'll dust.\\
86 - I did that, too.\\
87 - Then I'll check the batteries in the smoke detectors.\\
88 - Howard just did that.\\
89 - Yeah, let him do it.\\
90 - (gasps) Oh.\\
91 - Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?\\
92 - Leonard: Oh, yeah.\\
93 - The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.\\
94 - Live long and prosper. Live long and prosper.\\
95 - Live long and prosper.\\
96 - Live long and prosper.\\
97 - It's one of a kind.\\
98 - So if it breaks there'd be none of it?\\
99 - Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this?\\
100 - On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do.\\
101 - On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do.\\
102 - So you think you should keep it?\\
103 - I'll be right across the hall.\\
104 - You'll probably be able to hear it.\\
105 - Keep the clock, Sheldon.\\
106 - Thank you.\\
107 - Thank you.\\
108 - Thank you?\\
109 - Oh, now... (grunts) what about our 3-D chess set?\\
110 - Let me guess, you want it.\\
111 - Well, no, I just didn't think you'd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win.\\
112 - As a kindness, I should probably take all the games.\\
113 - You know what, Sheldon, take it.\\
114 - In fact, you can have everything.\\
115 - I really don't care.\\
116 - Are you sure?\\
117 - These items represent our shared times together.\\
118 - Well, now they're yours.\\
119 - Leonard....\\
120 - Well, you know what's gonna happen.\\
121 - He's just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his.\\
122 - For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?\\
123 - Sheldon, you're-you're being a little selfish.\\
124 - Why don't you let Leonard keep a few things?\\
125 - It's not my fault I'm bad at sharing; I skipped kindergarten.\\
126 - You know what?\\
127 - There is one thing I would like.\\
128 - Yeah, take whatever you want.\\
129 - I would like to keep... the official flag of our apartment.\\
130 - But you don't even like flags.\\
131 - Yeah, I like this one.\\
132 - But I designed it.\\
133 - But you made me order it because you were "too well-known" in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.\\
134 - But you don't even understand its symbolism.\\
135 - Oh, I do.\\
136 - The-the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means I'm happy about it.\\
137 - Come along, Amy.\\
138 - I know when I'm not wanted.\\
139 - I don't think you do, but all right.\\
140 - Stuart, you cooked?\\
141 - How did you know it wasn't me?\\
142 - There's only three people in this house, and you'd still be my fifth guess.\\
143 - (doorbell rings)\\
144 - That's Raj.\\
145 - You guys relax, I'll get it.\\
146 - Have some bread while it's still warm.\\
147 - (chuckles)\\
148 - It's like we have a butler.\\
149 - If I had a Batsuit I'd be Bruce Wayne.\\
150 - You have a Batsuit.\\
151 - It's pajamas, there's no cape.\\
152 - Hey, Raj.\\
153 - Hey, Stuart.\\
154 - What are you doing here?\\
155 - Oh, I'm living here again.\\
156 - Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?\\
157 - Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?\\
158 - No, I needed a place to stay and, with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.\\
159 - Okay, cool.\\
160 - Anyway, come on in, dinner's ready.\\
161 - Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout.\\
162 - Oh, okay.\\
163 - Well, if Bernadette wants her ankles to swell up even more, she can have that.\\
164 - Is the Wi-Fi working for you?\\
165 - Uh, hang on.\\
166 - I don't think so, I'm clicking on "One weird trick for a flat belly," but I'm still seeing "Celebrities who look like their pets."\\
167 - Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password.\\
168 - Are you sure?\\
169 - Well, the new network name is, "Ha ha ha, now I've got you," so...\\
170 - It's either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs.\\
171 - What a jerk.\\
172 - You're good at revenge; how do we get him back?\\
173 - Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person's boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I'm already doing that.\\
174 - Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back.\\
175 - Well, powder me in sugar and call me a donut, if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.\\
176 - Sheldon, I'm warning you, I can play this game, too.\\
177 - If it's like your 3-D chess game, then you're out of your length, width and depth.\\
178 - Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned.\\
179 - All right, I tried.\\
180 - "All right, I tried."\\
181 - That should be the title of your autobiography.\\
182 - Ooh, a second-degree burn.\\
183 - I've got the Neosporin.\\
184 - Who got hurt?\\
185 - It's a good thing you're cute.\\
186 - So, I was reading how it's a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class.\\
187 - Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.\\
188 - Oh, I know a CPR instructor who'll come to the house.\\
189 - That'd be great.\\
190 - Stuart: I'll give him a call.\\
191 - We met when I was sleeping on the beach and he thought I was dead.\\
192 - Thank you again for cooking.\\
193 - It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.\\
194 - You just kick back and relax; I've got it all under control.\\
195 - Although it was already under control.\\
196 - (clears throat)\\
197 - I'm sorry, you mumbled something?\\
198 - It's just that they've had plenty of help.\\
199 - Well, you know what they say-- it takes a village.\\
200 - Well, they already had a village.\\
201 - I noticed the village couldn't find time to put the crib together.\\
202 - Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival.\\
203 - You mean the one with the empty beer bottles in the sandbox?\\
204 - We'll pass, thank you.\\
205 - Do something, Batman.\\
206 - (gasps)\\
207 - Hey.\\
208 - What do you think you're doing?\\
209 - Separating my delicates.\\
210 - This is the level you're stooping to.\\
211 - No.\\
212 - This is the level I am stooping to.\\
213 - I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate.\\
214 - Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.\\
215 - Hey, what's up?\\
216 - I'm here to put the crib together.\\
217 - Ooh, sorry, I already did it.\\
218 - Oh, I don't know if you realize this, but I bought that crib.\\
219 - Oh, yeah, I read about that on WhoGivesACrap.com Why are you being like this?\\
220 - Because I love Howard and Bernadette and if I want to keep mooching off them, I need to be helpful.\\
221 - Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along.\\
222 - Why can't there be four wheels?\\
223 - Is this what you do when I'm not here, make really good points?\\
224 - Look-Look, just come in and help me build a baby swing.\\
225 - Thank you.\\
226 - If you're hungry you can eat your takeout; nobody touched it.\\
227 - I think I'm gonna go for a run.\\
228 - You want to come?\\
229 - No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, "Watch out, he's right behind you."\\
230 - Hello?\\
231 - Hey, how you doing?\\
232 - Uh, can I help you?\\
233 - I don't think so, but you're sweet for asking.\\
234 - What-What are you doing in our apartment?\\
235 - Oh, I rented a room from your neighbor, the tall guy... dressed like a little boy.\\
236 - Unbelievable.\\
237 - Okay, uh, I don't know what he told you, but you can't stay here.\\
238 - So, there are fresh linens on the bed and...\\
239 - Oh.\\
240 - Well, now, I see you've met Theodore.\\
241 - Theodore, these are your new roommates, Leonard and Penny.\\
242 - They're very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around.\\
243 - Sheldon, what do you think you're doing?\\
244 - My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night.\\
245 - It's like the '40s again.\\
246 - Anyway, I'll leave you be.\\
247 - I have to... oh, oh!\\
248 - He's expecting a newspaper in the morning.\\
249 - Apparently, they still make them.\\
250 - All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.\\
251 - That's true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldn't be a man in your kitchen who can't produce a single form of ID.\\
252 - Oh, oh, I have a receipt from a blood bank.\\
253 - I'm O-negative.\\
254 - And now you know as much about him as I do.\\
255 - Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles.\\
256 - The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?\\
257 - Great, go with the giraffes.\\
258 - Although... the high contrast of zebra stripes might provide better stimulus for a developing baby.\\
259 - Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.\\
260 - Good choice, boss.\\
261 - At least my nose is naturally brown.\\
262 - Hey, could you please go to the market for me?\\
263 - Get Stuart or Raj to do it.\\
264 - Howie, they've been doing everything for you.\\
265 - Mm, I know.\\
266 - It's really making me lose respect for both of them.\\
267 - Please just go to the store.\\
268 - Fine.\\
269 - Who wants to drive me to the store?\\
270 - Koothrappali: Me!\\
271 - Stuart: I'll do it!\\
272 - Take Raj.\\
273 - Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.\\
274 - What do you think?\\
275 - Should we go to a hotel?\\
276 - And just leave him here alone?\\
277 - Okay, I'll go to a hotel.\\
278 - Text me in the morning if you're still alive.\\
279 - Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?\\
280 - Oh, thanks to the coins I found in your couch, a day longer than I thought.\\
281 - This is ridiculous.\\
282 - I like the painting.\\
283 - Is that your mom?\\
284 - Sheldon, get out here!\\
285 - Will you keep it down?\\
286 - What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think I'm running?\\
287 - We lived together 13 years.\\
288 - How can you be so awful to me?\\
289 - I'm being awful?!\\
290 - You're the one who went out of your way to hurt me.\\
291 - Because you were being selfish.\\
292 - Dividing our belongings is difficult.\\
293 - (laughing): Why?\\
294 - I said I didn't care!\\
295 - Theodore: Excuse me.\\
296 - It's none of my business, but it sounds like a lot of this anger is coming from love.\\
297 - Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you.\\
298 - Well, I'm just gonna keep on talking.\\
299 - Seems like, with Sheldon moving out, you're in a new phase of your lives and it's easier to fight than to face the feelings that you have for one another.\\
300 - I think he might be right.\\
301 - Also, who is that?\\
302 - I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be.\\
303 - Well, for me, too.\\
304 - It's not the same with you gone.\\
305 - If you're looking for a new guy to live with...\\
306 - No!\\
307 - We're good. Thank you.\\
308 - So, no one's gonna tell me? Okay.\\
309 - Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions.\\
310 - Well, I'd like that, too.\\
311 - In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and I'm not just saying that because it touched your genitals.\\
312 - You promise?\\
313 - I do.\\
314 - And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well.\\
315 - Well... if we're rubbing genitals on things, that's where I shine.\\
316 - Little lower to the left.\\
317 - A little more.\\
318 - Is it good?\\
319 - No, still hideous.\\
320 - Well, I'm sure at some point, we won't even notice it's there.\\
321 - Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams.\\
322 - I think it brings the room together.\\
323 - Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?\\
324 - I'll do it.\\
325 - Why do you get to do it?\\
326 - I'm the artist.\\
327 - Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.\\
328 - Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.\\
329 - Bernadette: Howard!\\
330 - Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants.\\
331 - I think I'm in labor.\\
332 - Oh, oh, okay.\\
333 - Okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this.\\
334 - We have a plan.\\
335 - Somebody please tell me the plan.\\
336 - I'll get the hospital bag.\\
337 - I'll pull the van up.\\
338 - Meet you outside in 2 minutes.\\
339 - Team Baby, go!\\
340 - I love you.\\
341 - I love you, too.\\
342 - Are we hugging or having a baby?\\
343 - Let's go!
\subsection {Episode 11: The Birthday Synchronicity}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Hey, Stuart.\\
3 - What are you doing here?\\
4 - Oh, I'm living here again.\\
5 - Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know?\\
6 - Or is like a possum in the walls kind of thing?\\
7 - No. I needed a place to stay, and with the baby coming, I figured they could use some extra help.\\
8 - Hey, tomorrow, who wants to paint the nursery?\\
9 - I'll do it.\\
10 - Why do you get to do it?\\
11 - I'm the artist.\\
12 - Just because you're starving doesn't make you an artist.\\
13 - Just because I look sickly doesn't mean I'm starving.\\
14 - Bernadette: Howard?\\
15 - I think I'm in labor.\\
16 - Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.\\
17 - Uh, uh, uh, I can do this.\\
18 - We have a plan.\\
19 - Somebody please tell me the plan!\\
20 - I'll get the hospital bag.\\
21 - I'll pull the van up.\\
22 - Meet you outside in two minutes.\\
23 - Team Baby, go!\\
24 - (grunting)\\
25 - Wolowitz: Oh, man.\\
26 - This is really happening.\\
27 - You doin' okay?\\
28 - Here comes another contraction.\\
29 - Let's pick it up!\\
30 - All right, hold on.\\
31 - I'm gonna drive like we do in India.\\
32 - (horn honking) Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs!\\
33 - Stop that! This isn't India.\\
34 - Fine.\\
35 - What do one point three billion people know about having babies?\\
36 - Sorry. I know you were just trying to help.\\
37 - I love you.\\
38 - I love you, too.\\
39 - We're good.\\
40 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
41 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
42 -  The Earth began to cool \\
43 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
44 -  We built the Wall \\
45 -  We built the pyramids \\
46 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
47 -  That all started with a big bang \\

50 - The Birthday Synchronicity\\
51 - Amy?\\
52 - Wake up.\\
53 - Wh... What's wrong?\\
54 - It's midnight.\\
55 - Happy birthday.\\
56 - Sheldon.\\
57 - (loud honking)\\
58 - Okay, you can have this back in the morning.\\
59 - This is for you.\\
60 - I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies.\\
61 - I'll put in on the list with peaches and felt.\\
62 - What is this?\\
63 - A functional MRI of my brain.\\
64 - I did Sudoku before they took it so I'd be ripped.\\
65 - I love it. Thank you.\\
66 - And it's not just an MRI.\\
67 - The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.\\
68 - Sheldon!\\
69 - We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities.\\
70 - Is that okay?\\
71 - I didn't put on my come-hither plaid PJ's for nothing.\\
72 - You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid.\\
73 - You are a mystery.\\
74 - (loud knocking)\\
75 - Penny: Guys, wake up!\\
76 - Bernadette's having her baby!\\
77 - Leonard: Come on, we're going to the hospital!\\
78 - (quietly): I guess... I guess we should stop.\\
79 - Yeah. I'm afraid so.\\
80 - Childbirth, looming coitus?\\
81 - This is a banner night for female genitals.\\
82 - Now I see three of you.\\
83 - Do we know the father, or is this some Mamma Mia nonsense?\\
84 - I'm the father.\\
85 - Okay, Dad, how far apart are the contractions?\\
86 - No idea. Ask him.\\
87 - 12 minutes.\\
88 - 12 minutes?\\
89 - Why are you here?\\
90 - Aren't we supposed to get here an hour and a half early?\\
91 - This is a hospital, not the airport.\\
92 - I'm sorry. It's our first time.\\
93 - It's okay.\\
94 - This little one will be here before you know it.\\
95 - Do we know what we're having?\\
96 - No, we're keeping it a surprise.\\
97 - Old school. Nice.\\
98 - Not that old school.\\
99 - He knows.\\
100 - (sing-songy): You see, I was at the doctor's office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek.\\
101 - (imitating Raj): And talking like this doesn't make it less creepy.\\
102 - Sweetheart, go home.\\
103 - Come back when the contractions are five minutes apart for an hour.\\
104 - Raj: I'm sorry.\\
105 - That's ambiguous.\\
106 - Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?\\
107 - I'm just throwing this out there, but home births are very popular these days.\\
108 - Sheldon, what took you so long?\\
109 - Wolowitz might hand out cigars.\\
110 - I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.\\
111 - Damn, I need my inhaler.\\
112 - Just don't smoke.\\
113 - No, I went down the stairs too fast.\\
114 - (ringtone playing)\\
115 - Hey.\\
116 - Don't come to the hospital. We're headed home.\\
117 - Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?\\
118 - We showed up too early. We'll keep you posted.\\
119 - Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye.\\
120 - She said not to come. It's gonna be a while.\\
121 - (sighs) Well, first deliveries can be slow.\\
122 - I am starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.\\
123 - I found it, but it's empty.\\
124 - Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.\\
125 - Are you sure?\\
126 - I'd really like to.\\
127 - Well, should we, uh, head back up?\\
128 - Penny: Come on, guys.\\
129 - We're all awake. Why don't we go to a diner or something?\\
130 - Oh, uh, I don't know.\\
131 - Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?\\
132 - It doesn't matter what I want.\\
133 - It's your birthday. You decide.\\
134 - Penny: Oh, my God!\\
135 - It's your birthday! Let's do something fun.\\
136 - Uh...\\
137 - Well, we could go to a bar.\\
138 - Well...\\
139 - Okay, I can breathe again.\\
140 - Babe, they want to have s*x.\\
141 - Penny: Oh, of course!\\
142 - The annual birthday booty spectacular!\\
143 - That's a bit childish, isn't it?\\
144 - I'm sorry, and what flavor is your bubble gum cigar?\\
145 - Grape. I find it the most mild.\\
146 - All right, well, you two go have fun.\\
147 - If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky.\\
148 - Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.\\
149 - Do you really need to record this?\\
150 - Koothrappali: You'll be happy I did.\\
151 - (sing-songy): Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you weren't quite ready to come out yet.\\
152 - You wanted to make an entrance.\\
153 - I get it.\\
154 - And here's your daddy.\\
155 - When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasn't.\\
156 - All right, enough with the camera.\\
157 - Well, this is not for me. This is for the baby.\\
158 - Some day she's gonna want to see this.\\
159 - I'm sorry.\\
160 - Who's gonna want to see this?\\
161 - I... I said “she,” but lots of things are she-- boats and cars, whales.\\
162 - Like, “Thar she blows.”\\
163 - You're doing great.\\
164 - Raj!\\
165 - Well, okay, I'm gonna sign off now.\\
166 - This next part may contain some adult language.\\
167 - How could you?!\\
168 - We made it this far without knowing, and you ruined it!\\
169 - Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it!\\
170 - You told me it was a girl, and I didn't say it.\\
171 - Raj! You were supposed to keep that to yourself.\\
172 - Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.\\
173 - So... (laughs)\\
174 - ...where were we?\\
175 - Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly.\\
176 - I'm sorry.\\
177 - Oh, don't be.\\
178 - You were like a foxy tea kettle.\\
179 - (laughs)\\
180 - Well, shall we start over?\\
181 - Very well.\\
182 - What's wrong?\\
183 - I'm not sure.\\
184 - Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now it's feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels.\\
185 - Okay, that makes sense.\\
186 - I mean, the mood's a little different now.\\
187 - We-we don't have to rush.\\
188 - Oh, I know, but Leonard and Penny think we're doing it, and I don't want to disappoint them.\\
189 - And the mood continues to change.\\
190 - No, and also, I don't want to disappoint you. I...\\
191 - You know, come on. It's your birthday.\\
192 - I can soldier through this.\\
193 - H-Hold on.\\
194 - I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.\\
195 - Intriguing.\\
196 - Is “back on track” a hint that it has something to do with trains?\\
197 - No.\\
198 - Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna give...\\
199 - It's not about trains!\\
200 - Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?\\
201 - Stop talking about trains!\\
202 - Who's killing the mood now?\\
203 - Found the backup inhaler.\\
204 - Want to have s*x?\\
205 - Well, I didn't until I heard that.\\
206 - Hang on. I'm counting.\\
207 - It's okay.\\
208 - Mm.\\
209 - (knocking)\\
210 - Raj (sing-songy): Hello!\\
211 - Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl!\\
212 - (sing-songy): Oopsy, I did it again.\\
213 - Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.\\
214 - (sing-songy): You're gonna have to be quieter than that.\\
215 - Can I look yet?\\
216 - One second.\\
217 - (chuckles) All right, you can open your eyes.\\
218 - I thought I'd let Harry Potter make things hotter. (giggles)\\
219 - Wowza.\\
220 - I got a Gryffindor robe for you.\\
221 - (exhales): Oh...\\
222 - A Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff?\\
223 - How scandalous.\\
224 - You naughty girl.\\
225 - You went to the Wizarding World theme park without me.\\
226 - I did.\\
227 - Am I in trouble?\\
228 - Yes, you're in trouble-- you went to Wizarding World without me!\\
229 - Wait, what just happened?\\
230 - You know I've been wanting to go.\\
231 - (sighs) Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?\\
232 - Oh, you're right.\\
233 - I'm sorry.\\
234 - Ooh. Happy birthday to me.\\
235 - (knocking)\\
236 - Raj (sing-songy): Hello...\\
237 - Is this about the baby?\\
238 - No. People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.\\
239 - Good. Then you're used to this.\\
240 - Hey, Bernadette's water broke!\\
241 - Come on! Everyone to the hospital!\\
242 - Amy: You have got to be kidding me!\\
243 - Just try to relax. We'll be there any minute.\\
244 - Stuart, stop driving like an old man.\\
245 - Speed it up a little.\\
246 - I'm not an old man!\\
247 - I just can't see at night.\\
248 - (groaning): Here comes another one.\\
249 - Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right!\\
250 - All right, hang on.\\
251 - If you see any pedestrians, just call 'em out.\\
252 - (engine roaring)\\
253 - Howard and Bernadette's kid might be born on your birthday.\\
254 - How cool is that?\\
255 - Yeah, but I thought this baby was supposed to ruin their s*x life, not mine.\\
256 - Raj: This is not how I imagined this day going-- I should be with them right now.\\
257 - Well, it is their child.\\
258 - I know that.\\
259 - But to be fair, I've spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby.\\
260 - And Howard spent five minutes conceiving it.\\
261 - And I'm being generous.\\
262 - Five minutes?\\
263 - We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.\\
264 - Raj: And-and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay.\\
265 - I understand, but this is a special day for them.\\
266 - Can you just try and let it go?\\
267 - Sheldon: She's right.\\
268 - You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but I'm not going to ruin her birthday.\\
269 - I'll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year.\\
270 - (high-pitched): Boop.\\
271 - (groans)\\
272 - Deep breaths, slow breaths.\\
273 - I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.\\
274 - (crunching)\\
275 - Sorry. I... thought these were room ice chips.\\
276 - I'll go get some more.\\
277 - Uh, Stuart, while you're out there, don't come back.\\
278 - Okay.\\
279 - (chuckles)\\
280 - So, what are we gonna name this kid?\\
281 - Now that we know she's a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz.\\
282 - Could name her after your mom.\\
283 - Debbie?\\
284 - (chuckles) No.\\
285 - She hated that name.\\
286 - Did she have a middle name?\\
287 - Melvina.\\
288 - Let's keep thinking.\\
289 - Mm.\\
290 - Ah.\\
291 - It sucks that she's not here.\\
292 - I know.\\
293 - Hm.\\
294 - She would've been the best grandma.\\
295 - She did always have candy in her pocket.\\
296 - (exhales) Yeah.\\
297 - I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls weren't naturally warm.\\
298 - I didn't know her five minutes and she asked, (like Mrs. Wolowitz): “Are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?”\\
299 - Thank God you answered right, we wouldn't be here today.\\
300 - It's hard to believe Howard's having a kid.\\
301 - Yeah.\\
302 - Penny, you're the one who introduced him to Bernie.\\
303 - How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?\\
304 - It's not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far we've all come.\\
305 - Hmm.\\
306 - Hmm.\\
307 - You two got married.\\
308 - Sheldon and I are living together.\\
309 - But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds.\\
310 - Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now she's a successful pharmaceutical rep.\\
311 - Okay, you don't have to say “struggling” every time.\\
312 - You can just say “actress.”\\
313 - Howard went to space.\\
314 - Bernadette got her doctorate.\\
315 - Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope.\\
316 - We've all come a long way.\\
317 - There's a lot to be proud of.\\
318 - For God's sake, just drive in the knife, why don't you!\\
319 - What's your problem?\\
320 - Well, you're all thinking that I'm the only one who hasn't done anything worthwhile.\\
321 - I was not thinking it.\\
322 - Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable.\\
323 - Raj, if it's any consolation, I'm no better off than I was ten years ago.\\
324 - Oh, yay!\\
325 - I have a doctorate in astrophysics and I'm every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store!\\
326 - Raj! Show some compassion.\\
327 - Those are things that we think but don't say.\\
328 - Excuse me.\\
329 - Sorry, Stuart.\\
330 - Hey, I'm in a hospital and I'm not the patient.\\
331 - I'm fine.\\
332 - Come on, Bernie, breathe.\\
333 - Remember what you learned in birthing class.\\
334 - I remember thinking, “This is stupid” and I was right!\\
335 - Do you want me to get the nurse?\\
336 - No! If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off!\\
337 - I've come to peace with my relationship with my parents.\\
338 - That was a big milestone for me.\\
339 - Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard.\\
340 - You know, I didn't swallow it, but Amy said it counted.\\
341 - Hey.\\
342 - Hey.\\
343 - Still a loser or did you turn things around while you were gone?\\
344 - You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself.\\
345 - When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to women.\\
346 - I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was in the room.\\
347 - Oh, great, now I can say things like “I can't believe you're breaking up with me.”\\
348 - “Why are you breaking up with me?”\\
349 - “Yes, I'll still help you move”\\
350 - Anyone else want to try?\\
351 - Uh, yeah, I got something.\\
352 - Raj, not everybody could be a dog owner.\\
353 - Oh, what? Did your doggie break up with you too?\\
354 - Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out.\\
355 - I bought the first one, it didn't fall.\\
356 - Here.\\
357 - She's here, the baby's here!\\
358 - Oh! Oh.\\
359 - Congratulations!\\
360 - How's Bernadette?\\
361 - Tired, but great.\\
362 - They're both great.\\
363 - Does the baby have a name yet?\\
364 - We have named her Halley.\\
365 - Oh!\\
366 - Oh, like Halley's comet.\\
367 - Howard: Exactly.\\
368 - Also like the comet, Bernadette said she's not gonna have s*x with me for another 75 years.\\
369 - That's not a real thing, he's just joking.\\
370 - I'm gonna get back.\\
371 - Thank you for staying up, I can't wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather.\\
372 - Really?\\
373 - Of course.\\
374 - You hear that, Stuart?!\\
375 - I've got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing!\\
376 - (babies cooing)\\
377 - Oh, look at all the babies!\\
378 - Some will be successful, some may be homeless.\\
379 - It's fun to think about.\\
380 - I wonder which one's Halley.\\
381 - Kind of hard to see the names.\\
382 - Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.\\
383 - They all look the same to me.\\
384 - Koothrappali: Guys, she's my goddaughter, I think I'll know when I see her.\\
385 - (baby cries loudly like Mrs. Wolowitz)\\
386 - That one.\\
387 - Well, that was quite a day.\\
388 - It was.\\
389 - Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration.\\
390 - Hankius pankius.\\
391 - I was afraid you'd be too tired.\\
392 - Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line.\\
393 - If that's not foreplay, I don't know what is.\\
394 - (chuckles)
\subsection {Episode 12: The Holiday Summation}
1 - Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?\\
2 - Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up.\\
3 - You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year's.\\
4 - Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.\\
5 - Well, he doesn't live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.\\
6 - And that's the same man who complains you can't find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.\\
7 - (phone chimes)\\
8 - Oh. It's Bernadette. She says they're running late.\\
9 - "The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."\\
10 - Well, he didn't throw up on the baby. That's a win.\\
11 - (door opens)\\
12 - Hello.\\
13 - Hi.\\
14 - Hi! Welcome back. How was Texas?\\
15 - Oh, you know. The Lone Star state. Hmm.\\
16 - That should be its Yelp rating.\\
17 - It was not a great trip.\\
18 - Well, you're home now.\\
19 - Yeah. It is good to be home.\\
20 - I... Oh, good Lord! Is that mistletoe?\\
21 - Don't you maniacs own a calendar?\\
22 - I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.\\
23 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
24 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
25 -  The Earth began to cool \\
26 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
27 -  We built the Wall \\
28 -  We built the pyramids \\
29 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
30 -  That all started with a big bang \\
31 -  Bang! \\
32 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x12 \\
33 - The Holiday Summation\\
34 - Did you at least have a good flight down there?\\
35 - It was fine.\\
36 - Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me.\\
37 - I slept the whole way.\\
38 - So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?\\
39 - And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.\\
40 - Well, we were on our way to my mother's house...\\
41 - (gasps) How did we get in the car?\\
42 - Leonard: Hold on.\\
43 - How did you get him in the car?\\
44 - I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.\\
45 - So, while we're at your mother's house, it might be a good time to tell her that we're living together.\\
46 - Do we have to?\\
47 - I really don't want to hear the religious lecture.\\
48 - Maybe there won't be one.\\
49 - (scoffs) There's always one.\\
50 - She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend.\\
51 - That one had some un-Christian words in it.\\
52 - Well, she likes me.\\
53 - You know, there's a chance she might be okay with it.\\
54 - Eh, I don't know.\\
55 - I am her precious little boy.\\
56 - And you did take my flower.\\
57 - Do boys have flowers?\\
58 - Who knows what he has down there.\\
59 - Mm.\\
60 - Anyway...\\
61 - Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it.\\
62 - Amen.\\
63 - Given that your hands prepared it, isn't that a little self-serving?\\
64 - You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you're in a church with a guitar.\\
65 - Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.\\
66 - Oh, it's my pleasure. Mm.\\
67 - I'm so glad y'all could make it.\\
68 - So, tell me, what's going on back home?\\
69 - Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.\\
70 - (gasps) Oh, that's wonderful!\\
71 - Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?\\
72 - Welcome to Texas.\\
73 - They haven't said.\\
74 - Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.\\
75 - (gasps) Oh, wait, wait... I... Shouldn't we just eat?\\
76 - You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.\\
77 - Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.\\
78 - All right. This is on you. (clears throat)\\
79 - Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers.\\
80 - Now, while you scold us, I'm going to get a knife and a fork.\\
81 - Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon's not.\\
82 - Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.\\
83 - What?\\
84 - What... Where's the judgment?\\
85 - W-Where's the fire and brimstone?\\
86 - Where's the part where you tell us we're going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside?\\
87 - We're already there!\\
88 - Obviously, I would prefer if you weren't living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I'm very happy for you.\\
89 - And what "special circumstances" are those?\\
90 - Oh, boy, I think it's about to get bad.\\
91 - Shelly, how do I put this?\\
92 - By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.\\
93 - What, so... You thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?\\
94 - No! Just for the middle part.\\
95 - 'Cause at the end I assumed there'd be nurses.\\
96 - Well, this is highly insulting.\\
97 - Sheldon, don't overreact.\\
98 - I'm the child she was worried about?\\
99 - I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.\\
100 - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\
101 - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\
102 - What?\\
103 - Well, I was in my room, I couldn't hear what they were saying.\\
104 - I'll take over from here.\\
105 - Amy: He's been in there a long time.\\
106 - Should I go talk to him?\\
107 - He's upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.\\
108 - Are you going to?\\
109 - Oh, heck no.\\
110 - Sheldon, what... what are you doing?\\
111 - Just being the un-socialized eccentric my mother always thought I was.\\
112 - You startin' to see why I didn't go in there?\\
113 - Sheldon, if you're trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain't changing my mind.\\
114 - We're ignoring the fins... Okay.\\
115 - Yeah. And I don't understand why you're taking her side.\\
116 - By being my girlfriend, she's saying you're a weirdo, too.\\
117 - I don't think that's what she's saying.\\
118 - And...?\\
119 - That's exactly what she was saying.\\
120 - Can you believe my mother thinks we're both strange?\\
121 - Absolutely not!\\
122 - (quietly): That's... too loud.\\
123 - Absolutely not.\\
124 - Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.\\
125 - Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.\\
126 - You know, I'm sorry your mother made you feel bad.\\
127 - But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you're not alone.\\
128 - You're right.\\
129 - I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard's mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton...\\
130 - What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?\\
131 - I was going chronologically.\\
132 - You're right between Koothrappali's father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.\\
133 - Well, let's try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.\\
134 - I knew we should've never mentioned us living together in the first place.\\
135 - She was gonna find out eventually.\\
136 - Disagree.\\
137 - We've known about evolution since 1859.\\
138 - She still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat.\\
139 - This could have all been avoided if you'd only listened to me.\\
140 - Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.\\
141 - Why would you do that?\\
142 - This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.\\
143 - You "managed the situation."\\
144 - That's right.\\
145 - So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.\\
146 - Not your whole life!\\
147 - I mean, science. You got that.\\
148 - Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.\\
149 - But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.\\
150 - I have gotten much better at that.\\
151 - Have you?\\
152 - How am I feeling right now?\\
153 - What the... How should I know?\\
154 - Excited? Itchy?\\
155 - Give me the first letter.\\
156 - You and I are in a relationship.\\
157 - I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.\\
158 - How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?\\
159 - Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?\\
160 - "Delighted"?\\
161 - What... Not if I guessed for a hundred years.\\
162 - (knocking on door)\\
163 - Hi.\\
164 - Hey, guys.\\
165 - Hey.\\
166 - Hi. There's the little family!\\
167 - Hello.\\
168 - Hello.\\
169 - And their Sherpas.\\
170 - Mm-hmm.\\
171 - The baby's asleep, can we put her in your room?\\
172 - Yeah. Go ahead.\\
173 - Do you need help?\\
174 - No. I got it.\\
175 - Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.\\
176 - Sorry we're late.\\
177 - Oh, it's no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.\\
178 - Yeah. Here.\\
179 - I'll catch you up.\\
180 - (gasps) How did we get in the car?\\
181 - Stop.\\
182 - Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head...\\
183 - On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.\\
184 - I was acting odd intentionally.\\
185 - Really? So you can control it?\\
186 - Okay. Then what happened?\\
187 - Well, there's really not much left to tell.\\
188 - I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.\\
189 - (click, then Sheldon screams)\\
190 - My mother made me take it out.\\
191 - (screams)\\
192 - Amy put alcohol on it.\\
193 - (screams)\\
194 - And here we are.\\
195 - What did we miss?\\
196 - I couldn't explain it if I tried.\\
197 - So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?\\
198 - Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.\\
199 - So what did you and Leonard do?\\
200 - Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.\\
201 - It might've been the worst one we've ever had.\\
202 - Oh, my God, what happened?\\
203 - Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then, I find out that she watched two episodes without me.\\
204 - It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.\\
205 - I don't understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.\\
206 - I don't understand what's wrong with socks.\\
207 - To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.\\
208 - What happened with the tree?\\
209 - ("Sleigh Ride" by The Ronettes plays)\\
210 - You do make a cute elf.\\
211 - Oh, yeah?\\
212 - And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.\\
213 - Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.\\
214 - Oh cool, I'll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.\\
215 - Stupid idea.\\
216 - No, what's stupid is a physicist who doesn't understand when you swing an axe, you don't let go.\\
217 - For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!\\
218 - Ugh.\\
219 - It's 70 degrees, you didn't need mittens.\\
220 - You know how easily I blister.\\
221 - Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel.\\
222 - It's like I'm married to an old piece of fruit.\\
223 - Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or-or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.\\
224 - Fine. Thank you.\\
225 - Leonard?\\
226 - Yeah.\\
227 - There's something on the windshield.\\
228 - (grunting)\\
229 - You need a break?\\
230 - Do not need a break.\\
231 - There's no shame in asking for a break.\\
232 - If I need a break, I'll ask for a break!\\
233 - Ugh.\\
234 - Leonard?\\
235 - Yeah?\\
236 - There's a tree on you.\\
237 - Oh!\\
238 - Sh...\\
239 - Ooh.\\
240 - Ah.\\
241 - You want to decorate it tonight?\\
242 - Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.\\
243 - (both groan)\\
244 - (both panting)\\
245 - (animal chittering)\\
246 - I hope it kills us both.\\
247 - By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.\\
248 - So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?\\
249 - Sure.\\
250 - Hey, how's life with your baby?\\
251 - Really? You're never gonna touch their baby?\\
252 - To this day I've never touched Stuart.\\
253 - It's been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.\\
254 - (baby crying)\\
255 - Bernadette: Oh, please stop crying, I'm begging you!\\
256 - I don't know what else to do!\\
257 - My boobs are empty.\\
258 - Do you want lasagna?\\
259 - (baby continues crying)\\
260 - Shh, shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay.\\
261 - Shh.\\
262 - (crying stops)\\
263 - What have we done?\\
264 - Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime... and tushies.\\
265 - (chuckles)\\
266 - (baby crying)\\
267 - Ugh.\\
268 - It took me two hours to get her down.\\
269 - Oh, you-you relax, I'll take this shift.\\
270 - You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn't hear it.\\
271 - Not always, sometimes we'd leave.\\
272 - (crying stops)\\
273 - Hey, he got her to stop.\\
274 - That was so fast.\\
275 - Oh, he's really good with her.\\
276 - (voice breaking): Yeah, he has a gift.\\
277 - What's the matter?\\
278 - Nothing, these are happy tears.\\
279 - Oh, good. (chuckles)\\
280 - No they're not, you bozo!\\
281 - How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?\\
282 - I mean, it's Stuart.\\
283 - Maybe she's playing possum until he goes away.\\
284 - Not funny.\\
285 - She's tired, that was funny.\\
286 - Everyone's a better mom than me.\\
287 - Oh, don't take it so personally, maybe your baby's just a jerk.\\
288 - (cries loudly)\\
289 - Wait, so how does the story end?\\
290 - Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?\\
291 - Sheldon!\\
292 - W-What?\\
293 - Is there another twist coming?\\
294 - Is the baby not theirs at all?\\
295 - Ignore him.\\
296 - How did you get the baby to stop crying?\\
297 - Oh, I just talked to her.\\
298 - I've been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.\\
299 - You poor things, you must be exhausted.\\
300 - It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.\\
301 - (crying loudly)\\
302 - How can she hate me?\\
303 - I make her food in my chest!\\
304 - It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.\\
305 - She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.\\
306 - Now you hate me too!\\
307 - Shh, I don't hate you.\\
308 - (baby crying)\\
309 - (crying)\\
310 - (crying)\\
311 - (all three crying)\\
312 - It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues.\\
313 - And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job.\\
314 - Bernadette, you are doing a good job.\\
315 - Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.\\
316 - Thank you, Internet.\\
317 - I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.\\
318 - So things started to turn around?\\
319 - Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.\\
320 - Please tell me you didn't use Amy's magic juice.\\
321 - (whispering): Bernie?\\
322 - Bernadette: Shh.\\
323 - She's asleep.\\
324 - Great.\\
325 - And where are you?\\
326 - Down here.\\
327 - Oh. (chuckles)\\
328 - This is new.\\
329 - I didn't know what else to do.\\
330 - It worked.\\
331 - Well, I'd say that's thinking outside the box, but... (clicks tongue) ...come on.\\
332 - (chuckles)\\
333 - Don't make me laugh.\\
334 - (softly): Oh.\\
335 - Do you need help getting out?\\
336 - I think I live here now.\\
337 - It's fine. (chuckles)\\
338 - Is it okay if I get some sleep?\\
339 - Yeah, go ahead.\\
340 - Good job, Mommy.\\
341 - (chuckles)\\
342 - I'm proud of you.\\
343 - (voice breaking): Don't make me cry, either.\\
344 - Good night.\\
345 - I love both my girls.\\
346 - We love you, too.\\
347 - I can't believe you fit in the crib.\\
348 - I could take a bath in the sink.\\
349 - I don't, but I can.\\
350 - So how were your holidays?\\
351 - Oh, thank you for asking.\\
352 - Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother.\\
353 - She's in Bakersfield.\\
354 - Uh, usually my brother and sister go...\\
355 - (all snoring)\\
356 - Oh, come on!\\
357 - That was fun, thank you.\\
358 - Yeah, thanks.\\
359 - Our pleasure.\\
360 - See you guys at work.\\
361 - Koothrappali: Be there bright and early.\\
362 - Not me, paternity leave.\\
363 - Oh!\\
364 - A small human wreaks havoc on his wife's genitals and he gets time off.\\
365 - With pay, sucka!\\
366 - (door closes)\\
367 - Forgot the baby, still new to this.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Romance Recalibration}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - (baby crying)\\
3 - Bernadette: Please stop crying.\\
4 - I'm begging you. I don't know what else to do.\\
5 - My boobs are empty.\\
6 - Do you want lasagna?\\
7 - (baby fussing)\\
8 - It's okay, it's okay.\\
9 - Shh...\\
10 - (crying stops)\\
11 - What have we done?\\
12 - (door opens)\\
13 - (soft music playing)\\
14 - What... what's all this?\\
15 - Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so I wanted you to come home to something nice.\\
16 - Oh, that is so thoughtful.\\
17 - Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was the best rosé you'd ever had?\\
18 - Yeah, I remember us driving up there, going to the winery and... that's it.\\
19 - And this wine is why.\\
20 - Oh.\\
21 - Hey, what smells so good?\\
22 - I made your favorite: pizza bagels!\\
23 - (gasps)\\
24 - Pink wine and pizza bagels?\\
25 - It's like eighth grade all over again.\\
26 - I am so lucky to have you.\\
27 - Well, now be careful, these are hot.\\
28 - I-I could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead, I'm gonna keep it to myself.\\
29 - Oh.\\
30 - You always know what not to say.\\
31 - I just, I can't believe you did all this.\\
32 - Well, you know, it's easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, it's like a river.\\
33 - It's peaceful and deep.\\
34 - Your soul is, it's like a secret that I never could keep.\\
35 - You did not just quote an NSYNC song.\\
36 - I quoted your favorite NSYNC song.\\
37 - Oh... (chuckles)\\
38 - Mm.\\
39 - (belches)\\
40 - (chuckling): Damn.\\
41 - I burped so hard, I died in my game.\\
42 - (laughs)\\
43 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
44 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
45 -  The Earth began to cool \\
46 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
47 -  We built the Wall \\
48 -  We built the pyramids \\
49 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
50 -  That all started with a big bang \\
51 -  Bang! \\
52 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x13 \\
53 - The Romance Recalibration\\
54 - Leonard, I've been meaning to ask you: what size shoe do you wear?\\
55 - Why?\\
56 - I'm trying to take more of an interest in other people's lives.\\
57 - That's nice.\\
58 - I wear a size eight and a half.\\
59 - (giggles) That's small.\\
60 - So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?\\
61 - Are you gonna laugh at the answer?\\
62 - Only if the answer is "shopping for baby shoes."\\
63 - If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work and she's taking me.\\
64 - Oh, well you know, that is interesting.\\
65 - I wonder what kind of infection you'll come home with.\\
66 - My money's on fungal.\\
67 - They're still having girl's night across the hall.\\
68 - Oh, so, hang out with me and we'll have boys' night.\\
69 - At our age, why don't we call it man's night?\\
70 - Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.\\
71 - Penny, is it weird that we're having girls' night here, but you don't live here anymore, so it's basically my girls' night?\\
72 - I hadn't really thought about it.\\
73 - But now you're thinking about it and it bothers you?\\
74 - I get that.\\
75 - Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?\\
76 - Better than ever.\\
77 - He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life.\\
78 - He's like my boyfriend in college, except he's real, so people can see him.\\
79 - I've been seeing him for years, I'm still not convinced he's real.\\
80 - Hey, can I ask you a question?\\
81 - You've been married for a while.\\
82 - Is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?\\
83 - (sighs) Uh-oh, what's going on?\\
84 - Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants.\\
85 - It's okay, Howie never has on pants.\\
86 - The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now.\\
87 - Well, Sheldon always has his pants on.\\
88 - I don't think I could pick his knees out of a lineup.\\
89 - Well, it's not just the pants.\\
90 - Just, it's like since we got married, he doesn't really try anymore.\\
91 - Uh, Penny?\\
92 - I don't know how to say this, but this is my first girls' night and you're kind of bumming everybody out.\\
93 - All right, got Halley to sleep.\\
94 - Yeah, I heard you on the baby monitor.\\
95 - Didn't think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby.\\
96 - Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV, or someday, she'll want me to play outside.\\
97 - Boy, that floor is so squeaky.\\
98 - I'm surprised I didn't wake her up walking out of the room.\\
99 - Have you tried anything to fix it?\\
100 - Well, I put the rug down.\\
101 - It didn't help.\\
102 - I know. Blue shag.\\
103 - What were you thinking?\\
104 - Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.\\
105 - Did that do anything?\\
106 - Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, that's why I bought the rug.\\
107 - If you do that, I'll win in eight moves.\\
108 - I'll win in five moves.\\
109 - I'll win in one move.\\
110 - Oh, no. Good game.\\
111 - Hey.\\
112 - Hey.\\
113 - Oh, Penny, I'm trying to take an interest in other people.\\
114 - Uh, how was your girls' night?\\
115 - Oh, it was fine.\\
116 - Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?\\
117 - Uh, chips.\\
118 - (stammers) Anything to drink?\\
119 - Some wine.\\
120 - Well, I'm just playing tennis against the drapes here.\\
121 - Just ignore him.\\
122 - Hmm. At least he took an interest.\\
123 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
124 - Nothing.\\
125 - Hey, what's going on with you?\\
126 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
127 - Well, hey, come on, just tell me.\\
128 - Fine.\\
129 - Lately, I kind of feel like you've been taking me for granted.\\
130 - Wh-what? Where is this coming from?\\
131 - Sheldon: Leonard.\\
132 - She might be drunk.\\
133 - All she had was chips.\\
134 - It's just, since we got married you seem to think you don't have to try anymore.\\
135 - That is ridiculous.\\
136 - This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about it.\\
137 - No, No, no, no. Let's talk about it.\\
138 - I'm the one who's made all the effort in this relationship since day one.\\
139 - Please tell me what more I could do.\\
140 - Okay. You know what? Maybe I'll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead.\\
141 - Fine, go ahead.\\
142 - Amy is free.\\
143 - She had a harp lesson on Saturday, but it got canceled...\\
144 - Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense.\\
145 - Okay. Thanks, Daddy.\\
146 - He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.\\
147 - That sounds expensive. Hang on.\\
148 - No offense to her father, but he's not an MIT-trained engineer.\\
149 - Thinking and building is what you do.\\
150 - MIT's motto is "Mind and hand," which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager.\\
151 - Oh, come on. We just need to be more creative.\\
152 - What if you didn't step on the floor at all?\\
153 - Like, what if you... swung on a rope from the ceiling?\\
154 - (grunts)\\
155 - (groans)\\
156 - No.\\
157 - Okay. Um... Okay. What if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?\\
158 - (creaking)\\
159 - No.\\
160 - Bernadette: I have one.\\
161 - What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?\\
162 - Is that supposed to be funny?\\
163 - Hold on.\\
164 - (screaming)\\
165 - Yeah, that's funny.\\
166 - All right, we're heading out.\\
167 - Mm-hmm.\\
168 - I'll call you when we get to the hotel.\\
169 - And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?\\
170 - I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower.\\
171 - Have fun.\\
172 - Thanks.\\
173 - Are you ready?\\
174 - Uh-huh.\\
175 - Bye, Sheldon.\\
176 - You know what?\\
177 - I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.\\
178 - Go ahead, it's fine.\\
179 - Bye.\\
180 - Bye.\\
181 - Okay! Let's go!\\
182 - Bye.\\
183 - Bye.\\
184 - I'll miss you.\\
185 - Yeah, I'll miss you, too.\\
186 - I'll miss you more.\\
187 - Well, if X equals the amount that you'll miss me, then I'll miss you X plus one. (giggles)\\
188 - If you miss me X plus one, I'll miss you open paren X plus one, close paren to the second...\\
189 - Thank you.\\
190 - You're sad, so I made you tea.\\
191 - Thanks.\\
192 - And it's just the way you like it.\\
193 - Earl Grey?\\
194 - Yes.\\
195 - Honey?\\
196 - Yes.\\
197 - Unsweetened almond--\\
198 - Good Lord!\\
199 - I made you tea. Just drink it!\\
200 - Sorry, thank you.\\
201 - Well, what can we do to cheer you up?\\
202 - I really don't know.\\
203 - You want to play Jenga?\\
204 - Or, uh, Ticket to Ride?\\
205 - Hearthstone?
\subsection {Episode 14: The Emotion Detection Automation}
1 - What's going on with that woman you're dating?\\
2 - I broke up with her.\\
3 - Why?\\
4 - She said she didn't want to see me anymore and I found that insulting.\\
5 - I thought things were going well. What happened?\\
6 - I don't know, she didn't even give me a reason.\\
7 - Oh, not a problem, we can figure this out.\\
8 - What are the reasons women reject Raj?\\
9 - Koothrappali: Can we not play this game?\\
10 - Sheldon: Doesn't like games. That's one.\\
11 - Ignore him.\\
12 - Yeah, sorry about the breakup.\\
13 - That's okay, I'm fine.\\
14 - Sheldon: Of course you're fine.\\
15 - Not every member of a species finds a mate.\\
16 - Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin.\\
17 - Look at the contributions he made.\\
18 - I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.\\
19 - Wha... So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton? Oh.\\
20 - No wonder women don't like you.\\
21 - You're not being very nice.\\
22 - Sheldon: What? He said he was fine.\\
23 - Wolowitz: Sometimes people say things they don't mean.\\
24 - Sheldon: Oh, that's a paradox.\\
25 - I-If you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said.\\
26 - Careful, I saw this on Star Trek.\\
27 - Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.\\
28 - Hey. Hey, boys. How's it going?\\
29 - Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out, I was being offensive.\\
30 - So, normal. Yeah--\\
31 - (door closes)\\
32 - Sheldon, what did you do?\\
33 - We were discussing Raj's recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.\\
34 - It's okay, I'm fine.\\
35 - You Di-- Don't fall for it.\\
36 - He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you're the bad guy.\\
37 - Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore.\\
38 - Then why didn't you say that?\\
39 - Because that's not what people do.\\
40 - Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.\\
41 - No. No, you don't, you really don't.\\
42 - I actually can't say "don't" enough.\\
43 - Well, it certainly would be easier.\\
44 - You have no idea what it's like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.\\
45 - I'm sure it's extremely frustrating.\\
46 - Thank you. And also a little sad.\\
47 - O-Okay, now you're just showing off.\\
48 - You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions.\\
49 - And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.\\
50 - It's supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.\\
51 - Wow, I find that hard to believe.\\
52 - That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?\\
53 - I take it back. I believe it.\\
54 - You ift's at MIT, I can make some calls.\\
55 - Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.\\
56 - What do you think?\\
57 - A machine that reads emotions is intriguing.\\
58 - It could help me be a more considerate friend.\\
59 - Wouldn't that be nice.\\
60 - It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then...\\
61 - I could use those fears to destroy them.\\
62 - I like the first one.\\
63 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
64 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
65 -  The Earth began to cool \\
66 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
67 -  We built the Wall \\
68 -  We built the pyramids \\
69 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
70 -  That all started with a big bang \\
71 -  Bang! \\
72 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x14 \\
73 - The Emotion Detection Automation\\
74 - Now that Sheldon's across the hall, have you decided what you're doing with his old room?\\
75 - I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.\\
76 - You could make it a train room.\\
77 - I don't like trains.\\
78 - You like trains.\\
79 - I know, and Amy says I can't have a train room.\\
80 - Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader; they're sending a prototype for you to beta test.\\
81 - (gasps)\\
82 - Wonderful.\\
83 - Although I'm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.\\
84 - Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.\\
85 - Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.\\
86 - Oh, you don't need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize.\\
87 - That's actually not a bad idea.\\
88 - Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a... a focus group, to find out what's wrong with me.\\
89 - (chuckles) No, Raj, that's a terrible idea.\\
90 - Yeah, I was joking.\\
91 - You... Really?\\
92 - Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with "Wocka Wocka" or "ha-cha-cha."\\
93 - Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.\\
94 - Hey, can you hold off redoing the room?\\
95 - My brother's coming out here in a few weeks.\\
96 - Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What's going on with your brother?\\
97 - My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.\\
98 - Huh. Is that a good idea?\\
99 - I mean, you think they'll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?\\
100 - Well, I sell pharmaceuticals.\\
101 - That's just a really hard to spell word for drugs.\\
102 - Well, I'm sure he'll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon.\\
103 - How long do you think he'll stay?\\
104 - I-I'm not sure.\\
105 - Maybe a few days.\\
106 - Unless he gets the job, then who knows?\\
107 - Hmm. "Who knows?"\\
108 - That's exciting.\\
109 - I'll get to wake up every morning and see if he's still here.\\
110 - You don't have a problem with this, do you?\\
111 - Of course not. I mean, he's your brother.\\
112 - Okay. Thank you, you're the best. Mm.\\
113 - Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.\\
114 - This thing's pretty cool.\\
115 - It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyze subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.\\
116 - It's amazing a machine can do that.\\
117 - Yes.\\
118 - Now, when the robots rise up, they'll know that I've been rooting for them the whole time.\\
119 - The display is synced to your phone.\\
120 - Give it a try.\\
121 - All right.\\
122 - Now, I'm gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and we'll see if the machine can identify them accurately.\\
123 - Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited.\\
124 - Not other things you're feeling, like, "What have I done with my life?"\\
125 - Okay, I'm looking at the first picture.\\
126 - You are... happy?\\
127 - Yes. I'm looking at puppies.\\
128 - Aw. Somebody's ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right.\\
129 - Try another one.\\
130 - Okay.\\
131 - What does it say I'm feeling?\\
132 - Sad.\\
133 - Yes. I'm looking at a picture of my grandma.\\
134 - Oh, that makes sense, 'cause she's gone and you miss her.\\
135 - Yes.\\
136 - And you're worried that turkey neck is in your future.\\
137 - What, now, see...\\
138 - Now it says you're mad.\\
139 - Make up your mind.\\
140 - Okay, Emily.\\
141 - Yeah, sounds great.\\
142 - (chuckles)\\
143 - See you then.\\
144 - Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?\\
145 - Yeah. I'm getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.\\
146 - Oh, God. You went through with that?\\
147 - What is wrong with you?\\
148 - We are going to find out.\\
149 - Why would you do that, Raj?\\
150 - Well, I want information in order to improve myself.\\
151 - You're not gonna get information, you're just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.\\
152 - Don't worry, I'm a grown man.\\
153 - I have a thick skin.\\
154 - (chuckles): You're so stupid.\\
155 - Hey!\\
156 - Hey, would you take a look at my brother's résumé?\\
157 - I'm trying to help him clean it up a little.\\
158 - Yeah, sure.\\
159 - He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?\\
160 - He didn't know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.\\
161 - Hey, Leonard, if you're happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.\\
162 - How's it working out?\\
163 - Surprisingly well.\\
164 - That's great, I'm happy for you.\\
165 - No, wait, uh, hold on.\\
166 - Oh, what, you are.\\
167 - Aren't you sweet?\\
168 - What's that? Are you working on your resume?\\
169 - No, it's my brother's.\\
170 - I'm trying to help him get a job out here.\\
171 - Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.\\
172 - No, it doesn't.\\
173 - What, Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it.\\
174 - It's this red frowny guy on my phone.\\
175 - What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?\\
176 - No.\\
177 - Yes.\\
178 - I said no.\\
179 - I-It's like you're twins.\\
180 - Leonard, if you're mad about this, just tell me.\\
181 - (sighs)\\
182 - Fine.\\
183 - You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didn't bother to ask me first.\\
184 - He's my brother!\\
185 - I didn't think I needed your permission.\\
186 - Well, hey.\\
187 - Now she's angry, too.\\
188 - This thing works like gangbusters.\\
189 - I'm not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay.\\
190 - Like you talked to me about your gaming room?\\
191 - Our gaming room!\\
192 - I was gonna put a scented candle in it.\\
193 - He's still mad.\\
194 - Stop enjoying their fight.\\
195 - You first.\\
196 - If you were this upset, why didn't you say so when I told you?\\
197 - Because I didn't want to sound like a jerk.\\
198 - Well, you sound like one now.\\
199 - I don't see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while.\\
200 - If you get him a job, he's gonna live here forever!\\
201 - He would get his own place.\\
202 - Has he ever had his own place?\\
203 - Yes!\\
204 - Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?\\
205 - It still counts.\\
206 - You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?\\
207 - You... Hey!\\
208 - I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you.\\
209 - You gave me a bill at the end of every month.\\
210 - Stay out of this.\\
211 - You and your stupid machine started this fight!\\
212 - (gasps) You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn't have feelings.\\
213 - Come on, Sheldon, let's go.\\
214 - Gladly.\\
215 - Can we storm out?\\
216 - I think it loses its impact if we're chatting about it.\\
217 - Fine.\\
218 - I'll just give them the finger.\\
219 - Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming.\\
220 - Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes.\\
221 - No, he doesn't think it's stupid.\\
222 - Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so we'll call you "red-headed Emily" and you, "red-headed Emily, Junior."\\
223 - Hey, you went out with him. I didn't.\\
224 - Okay, uh, let's get things started.\\
225 - Um, why don't we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me.\\
226 - Want to kick it off?\\
227 - Oh, okay. Um... I'm Lucy, and I broke up with Raj because I have severe social anxiety, and he kept trying to force me into uncomfortable situations.\\
228 - Like this one?\\
229 - Yeah.\\
230 - I did do that.\\
231 - I can be insensitive to other people's boundaries.\\
232 - Howard, would you write that down?\\
233 - Oh... schmuck. Got it.\\
234 - Uh, next?\\
235 - Okay. Um...\\
236 - I'm Claire.\\
237 - And I guess I broke up with you because you were just really needy.\\
238 - Also, you were incredibly vain-- like, all the time you spent shaping your eyebrows...\\
239 - Okay, new rule-- everybody only gets one.\\
240 - Uh, next?\\
241 - Ooh, I'm not sure I'm comfortable sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard.\\
242 - Oh. He's here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him.\\
243 - Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed...\\
244 - Howard, get out.\\
245 - Not a chance.\\
246 - (chuckles)\\
247 - So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed.\\
248 - Sheldon, dinner's ready.\\
249 - I made beef loaf, because I know you're uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf.\\
250 - Sheldon?\\
251 - Hey, are you okay?\\
252 - Not really.\\
253 - What's going on?\\
254 - I wish I never tried that device.\\
255 - And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it.\\
256 - I'm sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.\\
257 - It's more than that.\\
258 - It's me.\\
259 - I always knew I had trouble recognizing other people's emotions, but that machine just made it so real.\\
260 - Well, everybody has things that they need help with.\\
261 - Like me-- I can't see without my glasses.\\
262 - And right now you're just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge.\\
263 - I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I'm not.\\
264 - Yes, you are.\\
265 - There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell.\\
266 - Yeah, but that's shooting fish in a barrel.\\
267 - You're kind of a sad sack.\\
268 - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.\\
269 - I'm just upset.\\
270 - No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings.\\
271 - And I'm proud of you-- for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.\\
272 - And if you don't like that machine, get rid of it.\\
273 - Because I love you exactly the way you are.\\
274 - I feel the same way about you.\\
275 - Now, put your glasses back on.\\
276 - You look weird.\\
277 - I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents.\\
278 - Emily: Oh, yeah, and that used to drive me nuts.\\
279 - He's kind of a mama's boy.\\
280 - Kind of?\\
281 - Koothrappali: Whoa, okay!\\
282 - That's enough.\\
283 - Write down "loving son."\\
284 - Can I just say something?\\
285 - Going out with Raj was one of the best things that ever happened to me.\\
286 - Yes, I'll take you back.\\
287 - (chuckles): Let me finish.\\
288 - It's like I needed to go through that experience to know what exactly I don't want in a man.\\
289 - Well, that's hard to hear, but I'll still take you back.\\
290 - You know, the same thing happened to me.\\
291 - After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary, who's just amazing.\\
292 - Sorry, is that "Gary" with one R or two?\\
293 - Would you stop writing?!\\
294 - Just wait. So... did all of you go on to better relationships after me?\\
295 - Oh, yeah.\\
296 - Without question.\\
297 - Little before, actually.\\
298 - Oh, wow.\\
299 - (chuckles)\\
300 - Don't let him get away.\\
301 - Wait.\\
302 - What did she say?\\
303 - Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne.\\
304 - (sighs) Okay, maybe we should just end this.\\
305 - (sighs)\\
306 - Wait, hang on.\\
307 - I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself.\\
308 - Even at the risk of...\\
309 - (chuckles): being humiliated.\\
310 - And I, for one, think that's very brave.\\
311 - Thank you, Howard.\\
312 - Honestly, I'm surprised you two didn't wind up together.\\
313 - Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette.\\
314 - (goofy voice): With it were you.\\
315 - Yes?\\
316 - We owe you an apology.\\
317 - Oh, it's fine.\\
318 - You needed a suitcase, I wasn't home, you borrowed a suitcase.\\
319 - That was six years ago.\\
320 - I'm talking about tonight.\\
321 - Oh.\\
322 - Well, I thought we were going in order.\\
323 - Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it.\\
324 - Leonard: And... sorry about the suitcase.\\
325 - Yeah, well, you should be.\\
326 - Your socks were still in it.\\
327 - I had to throw it away.\\
328 - Anyway, I, uh, trust that you've resolved your conflict.\\
329 - Yes, we're fine.\\
330 - Mm, Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him it's not a good time for Randall to visit.\\
331 - Hopefully, he won't be too upset.\\
332 - Oh, you're his little girl-- he can't stay mad at you.\\
333 - He won't be mad at me.\\
334 - I mean, you're the one who doesn't want my brother to come, so...\\
335 - So you're gonna throw me under the bus?\\
336 - Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal.\\
337 - Uh, guys, it sounds like you're getting angry again.\\
338 - That's because we are.\\
339 - Yes!\\
340 - I don't need an emotion machine!\\
341 - I am one!\\
342 - Thanks, ladies!\\
343 - This was fun!\\
344 - Let's not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night.\\
345 - Well, that was a waste of time.\\
346 - I'm such an idiot.\\
347 - Don't beat yourself up.\\
348 - That's what I'm here for.\\
349 - Maybe I won't settle down.\\
350 - Maybe I'll just play the field.\\
351 - Yeah, the field was just here.\\
352 - The field said no.\\
353 - Dude, come on.\\
354 - (sighs)\\
355 - Okay, I'll tell you what.\\
356 - I'll make you a deal.\\
357 - 30 years from now, if you're still single and things don't work out with me and Bernadette... you and I can give it a go.\\
358 - I appreciate the offer, but if things don't work out with you two, I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.\\
359 - Too late.\\
360 - Stuart called dibs.\\
361 - But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people?\\
362 - Like, print up announcements?\\
363 - (chuckles) I don't know.\\
364 - What difference does it make?\\
365 - Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.\\
366 - Those do look fun.\\
367 - Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip.\\
368 - If you didn't want me to eat it, why'd you put it out?\\
369 - It was for the girls.\\
370 - They broke up with me--\\
371 - I don't care if they get fat.\\
372 - I'm not gonna get fat.\\
373 - Oh, you want to bet?\\
374 - You never exercise.\\
375 - Fine. Look, I'll exercise right now.\\
376 - (strained grunting): One... two...\\
377 - (crunching)\\
378 - These are crunches, by the way.\\
379 - Very mature.\\
380 - Keep eating like that.\\
381 - You're gonna have a heart attack.\\
382 - Okay. How about if I eat like this?\\
383 - Mmm...\\
384 - (laughing): You're such a child.\\
385 - Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?\\
386 - Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay?\\
387 - I would never marry you.\\
388 - Please.\\
389 - When you see the ring I pick out, you're gonna melt.\\
390 - Yeah, right.\\
391 - Wait, is it rose gold?\\
392 - Actually, don't tell me.\\
393 - I want to be surprised.\\
394 - So, did you wind up sending that machine back?\\
395 - I did. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.\\
396 - I took it to the train store-- it said everyone was sad.\\
397 - I finally got Halley to sleep.\\
398 - You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years.\\
399 - Amy: It's true.\\
400 - Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy. all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up.\\
401 - We can't. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.\\
402 - Hey, uh, Bernadette, let's test this theory.\\
403 - What do you think I'm feeling right now?\\
404 - Let's see.\\
405 - You're better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don't have to be us.\\
406 - Keep filling this one with babies. She's good.
\subsection {Episode 15: The Locomotion Reverberation}
1 - Okay, I'm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel.\\
2 - Nicely done, Howard.\\
3 - Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things.\\
4 - Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child.\\
5 - Those are just the things I say out loud.\\
6 - Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately.\\
7 - What's wrong?\\
8 - I'm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller.\\
9 - That's great, but the Air Force approved the specs.\\
10 - We're good to go.\\
11 - Yeah. It doesn't need to be smaller.\\
12 - Shame on you.\\
13 - Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude?\\
14 - I'll tell you.\\
15 - We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup.\\
16 - Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but that's just poodle politics.\\
17 - Can we please stop talking about poodles?\\
18 - Fine. Candy bars.\\
19 - Now, do you enjoy a fun size?I  know you do.\\
20 - Sheldon, we don't need to make this smaller.\\
21 - Your work is done. Go home.\\
22 - I don't want to go home.\\
23 - Fine, go for a little walk.\\
24 - Then what?\\
25 - Just keep walking.\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
27 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
28 -  The Earth began to cool \\
29 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
30 -  We built the Wall \\
31 -  We built the pyramids \\
32 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
33 -  That all started with a big bang \\
34 -  Bang! \\
35 -  The Big Bang Theory 10x15 \\
36 - The Locomotion Reverberation\\
37 - At least it's quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.\\
38 - I know.\\
39 - That's why I keep refilling his water when he's not looking.\\
40 - You're kidding.\\
41 - I don't care if we're in a drought, it's worth it.\\
42 - You know, I-I do have a way to get him out of our hair.\\
43 - I've been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe now's the time.\\
44 - W-We can just lock the door; you don't have to kill him.\\
45 - You can't kill him; he'll just respawn at the last save point.\\
46 - Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom.\\
47 - As long as that's not a urinary tract infection, that's a personal best.\\
48 - Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present.\\
49 - Really?\\
50 - Yeah. Go ahead, open it.\\
51 - "Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive."\\
52 - This doesn't happen very often, but here comes a hug.\\
53 - Oh, dear! I have to tinkle again!\\
54 - Okay. Where were we?\\
55 - For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?\\
56 - Well, he mentioned it in his mother's eulogy, so why not?\\
57 - I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.\\
58 - Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list.\\
59 - I warned you, a lot of people apply when they're still pregnant. Well, I didn't.\\
60 - I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia, so back off.\\
61 - Whoa. Just trying to help.\\
62 - Sorry. Howie's back at work and there's just so much going on.\\
63 - Is there anything we can do?\\
64 - Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry.\\
65 - Wash it or burn in, your choice.\\
66 - (Halley crying over monitor)U gh, be right back.\\
67 - No, no. I will take care of it.\\
68 - Oh, thank you.\\
69 - While I'm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me.\\
70 - All right, you know what you need?\\
71 - A night away from all of this.\\
72 - You know, where you can just kind of relax and...\\
73 - (Halley continues crying over monitor)\\
74 - I'm just gonna... turn this off.\\
75 - (Halley continues crying nearby)\\
76 - Much better. (clears throat)\\
77 - Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give you a break.\\
78 - We could go dancing.\\
79 - That sounds really nice.\\
80 - Amy: Oh.\\
81 - All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir.\\
82 - Okay, that's the one to beat.\\
83 - Good luck.\\
84 - People have been saying that for 600 years.\\
85 - Hey, you're home early.\\
86 - You'll never believe it.\\
87 - Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive.\\
88 - Wow. He finally used it.\\
89 - What'd you do?\\
90 - No idea.\\
91 - All I know is I'm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.\\
92 - Well, I'm really happy for you.\\
93 - Oh, no. It's not just me. No.\\
94 - The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me.\\
95 - I give up.\\
96 - You!\\
97 - No. I really give up.\\
98 - Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep?\\
99 - Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose.\\
100 - Now, the problem with a caboose is there's no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.\\
101 - On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine.\\
102 - Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine.\\
103 - Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, they'll let me stay as long as I want.\\
104 - So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives.\\
105 - Can I pee now?\\
106 - Oh, get this!\\
107 - I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual.\\
108 - I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh.\\
109 - There's forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes.\\
110 - Are you done yet?\\
111 - You're missing some great stuff out here.\\
112 - Oh, this is good.\\
113 - There are dozens of railroad crossings you have to blow the whistle for.\\
114 - But that is the figurative you, not the literal you.\\
115 - I'll be blowing the whistle.\\
116 - Amy, get up. It's time to go to work.\\
117 - (groans)\\
118 - This train thing worked out better than I thought.\\
119 - He's home studying the engineer's manual.\\
120 - (sighs)\\
121 - It's so peaceful without him here.\\
122 - Can I ask you how much that cost?\\
123 - $4,000-- worth every penny.\\
124 - (knock on door)\\
125 - Gentlemen.\\
126 - Colonel Williams. Sir.\\
127 - Just wanted to see how the guidance system's coming along.\\
128 - Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.\\
129 - As a cooling solution, it's pretty cool.\\
130 - (chuckles)\\
131 - Don't do that.\\
132 - What's this?\\
133 - Oh, nothing. Just some math we don't need.\\
134 - This is a different approach.\\
135 - Are you trying to get the guidance system even smaller?\\
136 - It's just a theory.\\
137 - Uh, it's not even worked out.\\
138 - Oh. (chuckles)\\
139 - I want this.\\
140 - But we've already met the agreed upon specs.\\
141 - Going smaller would require weeks' worth of new computations.\\
142 - So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.\\
143 - Sir, uh, i-if I may, uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype.\\
144 - It's a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works.\\
145 - Yeah, I want this.\\
146 - But that's just a theory.\\
147 - It's not even a complete thought.\\
148 - You both make excellent points.\\
149 - And thank you for presenting it so articulately.\\
150 - (chuckles) Make this.\\
151 - (door closes)\\
152 - The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.\\
153 - All right. You guys ready to get crazy?\\
154 - Well, the bra under here ain't beige.\\
155 - Koothrappali: Okay.\\
156 - You ladies have fun tonight.\\
157 - Don't worry about Halley. Uncle Stuart's on the job.\\
158 - Under the careful supervision of her godfather.\\
159 - My apologies. I didn't mean to offend you, Don Corleone.\\
160 - Like I said, you ladies have fun.\\
161 - We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump.\\
162 - Let's party.\\
163 - You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise we'll get free drinks.\\
164 - Call if there's any problems.\\
165 - No. She's busy. You call Howard.\\
166 - Got it.\\
167 - Call me. Don't call Howard.\\
168 - I would never call Howard.\\
169 - Okay, instead of arguing all night, let's just split up the baby chores.\\
170 - Yeah, great. Um, I'll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom.\\
171 - I can't believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.\\
172 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
173 - I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon.\\
174 - (electrical crackling)\\
175 - What is that?\\
176 - I don't know, but if he yells, "It's alive," we run.\\
177 - Oh, hey.\\
178 - If you knocked, I couldn't hear you.\\
179 - I'm welding this locomotive engine.\\
180 - And if you didn't knock, how about some manners?\\
181 - How'd you even get that up the stairs?\\
182 - I said to myself, "I think I can, I think I can."\\
183 - And then I couldn't, so...\\
184 - I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later.\\
185 - Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we can't do it without you.\\
186 - Interesting.\\
187 - Well, so I was right.\\
188 - Open a window. It's about to get smug in here.\\
189 - Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I don't think I can go back to theory.\\
190 - I'm an engineer now.\\
191 - And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer.\\
192 - Not that goofy kind you are.\\
193 - Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks.\\
194 - Just help us out.\\
195 - Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I won't look foolish.\\
196 - (laughs)\\
197 - He's worried about looking foolish.\\
198 - That's a heapin' helping of irony right there.\\
199 - Come on, you know you're not leaving physics.\\
200 - Why are you doing this?\\
201 - Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish; so much is unprovable.\\
202 - But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked.\\
203 - Then it clacked.\\
204 - Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are.\\
205 - (imitates train whistle): Whoo-whoo!\\
206 - Did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?\\
207 - Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.\\
208 - Okay, stop that! No more preschool talk.\\
209 - Tonight is about having fun.\\
210 - Nothing says fun like being scolded.\\
211 - (ringtone playing)\\
212 - It's Raj.\\
213 - Everything okay?\\
214 - Don't worry. Everything's fine.\\
215 - Hang up! We don't need help.\\
216 - I don't need your help deciding when we need help!\\
217 - Raj, what's going on?\\
218 - Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I-I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says "Flerbsday."\\
219 - It says "Tuesday."\\
220 - How is that a "T"?!\\
221 - I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.\\
222 - Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch.\\
223 - You're wasting perfectly good milk.\\
224 - Fine, you drink it. It's just milk.\\
225 - Stuart, don't you drink my milk!\\
226 - Okay, give--\\
227 - Can you guys handle this or not?\\
228 - Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time.\\
229 - (chuckles)\\
230 - She said I was in charge.\\
231 - Hmm.\\
232 - So we just throw this away?\\
233 - What else are you gonna do with it?\\
234 - Put it in your coffee?\\
235 - Well, I don't take it black.\\
236 - Okay. This is everything he had on the board.\\
237 - I'm sure we can figure the rest out.\\
238 - All right.( clears throat)\\
239 - Hmm.\\
240 - Feel free to jump in.\\
241 - "Hmm" is all I got.\\
242 - Oh, we can get this.\\
243 - Is there any chance it's upside-down?\\
244 - Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.\\
245 - It's classified. If we tell anyone, we'd get in trouble.\\
246 - Hey, I came up with that and "hmm."\\
247 - You haven't pitched anything.\\
248 - Just keep thinking.\\
249 - I got it.\\
250 - You really figured it out?\\
251 - No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and he'll have to fix it.\\
252 - Oh, you're a genius.\\
253 - Yeah, I know.\\
254 - That's not even a math symbol.\\
255 - That's just Charlie Brown's hair.\\
256 - Sorry, guys.\\
257 - This club was so great.\\
258 - How could they turn it into a bookstore?\\
259 - I thought we got rid of all those.\\
260 - Renaissance Choir's looking pretty good right now, huh?\\
261 - (ringtone playing)\\
262 - Hello?\\
263 - (Halley crying)\\
264 - Nothing to worry about.\\
265 - She's just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep.\\
266 - She was sleeping just fine till you took a selfie with her!\\
267 - She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable!\\
268 - You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?\\
269 - (whispers): Wait.\\
270 - She's settling down.( Halley quiets)\\
271 - Oh, okay, false alarm.\\
272 - Little parenting tip: sleeping babies hate flash photography.\\
273 - Is everything okay?\\
274 - Yeah.\\
275 - I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.\\
276 - Hey, there's another dance club nearby.\\
277 - I mean, I don't know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operación, they're open.\\
278 - Maybe we should just call it a night.\\
279 - You sure? They're open till dos.\\
280 - Yeah, we're all dressed up.\\
281 - Why go home?\\
282 - I'm just not really in the mood anymore.\\
283 - What's going on with you?\\
284 - I don't know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.\\
285 - I'm not sad.\\
286 - I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.\\
287 - I'm not sad.\\
288 - I mean, hello.\\
289 - Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.\\
290 - What are you sad about?\\
291 - Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.\\
292 - You're upset I had a baby?\\
293 - No, of course not. I just...\\
294 - I didn't think it would make me have all these feelings.\\
295 - What feelings?\\
296 - Pressure!\\
297 - I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401(k).\\
298 - Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race.\\
299 - You think that stuff is fun?\\
300 - Being a parent is terrifying.\\
301 - I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes, I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.\\
302 - I get that, okay?\\
303 - It's just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and we're no further along than when we were dating.\\
304 - Amy: Come on.\\
305 - You've got so much to feel good about.\\
306 - You've got a great job now.\\
307 - Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.\\
308 - You make more than I do.\\
309 - You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.\\
310 - It's bigger than mine.\\
311 - And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.\\
312 - I'm not even engaged once.\\
313 - I don't even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage.\\
314 - I'm not getting any younger.\\
315 - Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort of...\\
316 - Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.\\
317 - I'm sorry. I can't help it.\\
318 - (crying)\\
319 - Oh, that's gonna make me cry.\\
320 - (crying)\\
321 - And there they go.\\
322 - Ew.\\
323 - Well, Sheldon, turns out we didn't need you after all.\\
324 - That's right. We figured it out all by ourselves.\\
325 - Wasn't even that hard. No.\\
326 - Well, good for you guys.\\
327 - Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and I'm okay with it.\\
328 - Aren't you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?\\
329 - No, thanks. I'm busy trying to fix this fuel pump.\\
330 - It's a manifold.\\
331 - Oh.\\
332 - Well, I guess it's fixed.\\
333 - Just look at the board.\\
334 - That's wrong.\\
335 - Oh, no!\\
336 - What should we have done differently?\\
337 - Well, first of all, you can't use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation.\\
338 - Told ya. (scoffs)\\
339 - Can you fix it for us?\\
340 - (sighs)\\
341 - Okay, but this is the last time.\\
342 - Nice try, blockheads.\\
343 - Come on, Sheldon. You can't turn your back on physics.\\
344 - Besides, you have no idea what you're doing with this stuff.\\
345 - But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know.\\
346 - Leonard: And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system.\\
347 - And with all these new skills, you'd be able to fix any model train.\\
348 - You'd be the king of the train store!\\
349 - Excuse me. I have a girlfriend.\\
350 - I'm already king of the train store.\\
351 - So, what do you say?\\
352 - Oh, what choice do I have? You need me.\\
353 - I'm like the crankshaft of this team.\\
354 - That's a turbo.\\
355 - Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy.\\
356 - I'm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home.\\
357 - (train chugging, steam hissing)\\
358 - (train whistle blows)\\
359 - I apologize that it's so warm in here.\\
360 - It is warm in here.\\
361 - I've worked up a bit of a sweat.\\
362 - Me, too.\\
363 - May I borrow your water?\\
364 - ("Rock You Like a Hurricane" by Scorpions playing)\\
365 -  Here I am \\
366 -  Rock you like a hurricane \\
367 -  Here I am \\
368 -  Rock you like hurricane... \\
369 - Sheldon: The light's green.\\
370 - Sorry.\\
371 - GPS says we'll be at the railway in three hours.\\
372 - I can get us there in two.\\

1 - Go! (inhales deeply)\\
2 - Come on, Raj!\\
3 - Leonard: You can do this!\\
4 - There's no way.\\
5 - What is happening?\\
6 - This is an Euler's Disk.\\
7 - It's a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy.\\
8 - Aw, look at you watching sports.\\
9 - We're betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.\\
10 - Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.\\
11 - But Raj is from India, which means he's no slouch at holding his breath.\\
12 - Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I'll lose interest before that thing stops spinning.\\
13 - Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night.\\
14 - Kind of busy right now.\\
15 - Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!\\
16 - Yeah, we're seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it.\\
17 - Oh. Immature.\\
18 - How ya doing?\\
19 - Mm.\\
20 - He's not gonna make it.\\
21 - Yes, he is!\\
22 - You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage.\\
23 - Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage.\\
24 - (muffled groaning)\\
25 - My God, how long does this thing spin for?\\
26 - Ha! You're interested! You're out ten bucks!\\
27 - It's slowing down! Dig deep!\\
28 - Like when we bet you couldn't fit into Howard's pants!\\
29 - (groaning)\\
30 - He's not gonna make it!\\
31 - Yes, he is!\\
32 - Come on, Raj! It's like your favorite movie! You're just Waiting to Exhale!\\
33 - (exhales)\\
34 - Yeah! I knew you could do it!\\
35 - (panting): And j.. and just so you know, my favorite movie... is Princess Bride.\\
36 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
37 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
38 -  The Earth began to cool \\

49 - (sighs)\\
50 - Hello, Rajesh.\\
51 - How are things by you?\\
52 - Good, good.\\
53 - Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month.\\
54 - Well, you're a grown man with a steady job.\\
55 - Why wouldn't you spend all your father's money?\\
56 - (chuckling): Oh, Daddy, you're so rich and funny.\\
57 - Yeah. So what else is going on with your life?\\
58 - Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up.\\
59 - I'm sorry to hear that.\\
60 - I know you are. That's why you just bought me a new iPad.\\
61 - And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me.\\
62 - Oh, I gave up on that a long time ago.\\
63 - You did?\\
64 - It's too much work.\\
65 - You're an adult who can't get by without an allowance from his parents.\\
66 - Women don't want that.\\
67 - Wh-What are you saying, that y-you're giving up on me?\\
68 - What kind of father gives up on his son?\\
69 - I have six children, five of whom are married and self-sufficient.\\
70 - I don't think I'm the problem.\\
71 - I can't believe what I'm hearing.\\
72 - This is deeply hurtful.\\
73 - You're also too sensitive.\\
74 - Women don't want that either.\\
75 - The food here's supposed to be great.\\
76 - Don't fill up on chips.\\
77 - Oh, I won't.\\
78 - I have a trick.\\
79 - I only eat equilateral triangles.\\
80 - Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene...\\
81 - You didn't see that.\\
82 - Oh, look.\\
83 - It's Bert, at the bar.\\
84 - We should go say hi.\\
85 - Why?\\
86 - Because that's what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.\\
87 - I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.\\
88 - Sheldon, there's a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom.\\
89 - If the judge couldn't explain it to me, I don't see how you will.\\
90 - Hi, Bert.\\
91 - Hello.\\
92 - Oh, hey, guys.\\
93 - What brings you here?\\
94 - Oh, we're having date night.\\
95 - Nice.\\
96 - I'm meeting someone, too.\\
97 - Oh, really. Anybody we know?\\
98 - I doubt it. I met her on G-Harmony.\\
99 - That's a Web site for geologists to find love.\\
100 - That's a real thing?\\
101 - Yeah. Their slogan is “We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind”"\\
102 - Well, have a lovely evening.\\
103 - Thanks. You, too.\\
104 - If you think that's more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, you're crazy.\\
105 - You know, we could've come to you guys.\\
106 - You didn't have to bring the baby here.\\
107 - Oh, it's okay. It's good to get out of the house.\\
108 - And the car ride puts her to sleep.\\
109 - Aw, that used to work with Sheldon.\\
110 - Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out.\\
111 - Who forgot to crack the window?\\
112 - Hello!\\
113 - Leonard: Hey.\\
114 - Penny: Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.\\
115 - Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldn't resist.\\
116 - That's so sweet of you.\\
117 - Yeah, it's a crushed velvet baby cape.\\
118 - Oh, no, now we have two.\\
119 - That must've been expensive.\\
120 - Yeah, it was.\\
121 - But it's my father's money and I'm mad at him.\\
122 - What's going on with your dad?\\
123 - And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel.\\
124 - (clears throat)\\
125 - It turns out he doesn't care if I'm married or if I'm single.\\
126 - He's basically given up on me.\\
127 - Oh, I'm sure that's not true.\\
128 - It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry.\\
129 - All you did was complain when he did that.\\
130 - Leonard, he's hurting.\\
131 - Let him feel how he feels.\\
132 - Thank you, Penny.\\
133 - Yeah.\\
134 - Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half; boots, I'm an eight.\\
135 - ...MSN Search, AltaVista, and... Ask Jeeves.\\
136 - You?\\
137 - Sorry, I don't have a list of defunct search engines that I miss.\\
138 - Hey. Looks like I got stood up, so I'm gonna head out.\\
139 - Oh, no. Are you sure you don't want to give her a few more minutes?\\
140 - Nah, G-Harmony recommends after two hours, it's time to cut bait.\\
141 - I'm so sorry.\\
142 - Bert, I insist that you join us.\\
143 - You really wouldn't mind?\\
144 - Not at all. Amy?\\
145 - Fine with me.\\
146 - Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.\\
147 - Sheldon, that was so sweet of you.\\
148 - Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad.\\
149 - So the part where he got stood up didn't clue you in?\\
150 - You want me to look at him and listen to him?\\
151 - My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.\\
152 - I'm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?\\
153 - Just because he helps me out doesn't automatically mean that I'm spoiled.\\
154 - All right, how much exactly does he pay for?\\
155 - Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.\\
156 - He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.\\
157 - I'm trying, but I'm judging.\\
158 - Maybe your dad's right.\\
159 - Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.\\
160 - But Bernadette makes more money than Howard.\\
161 - She basically supports him.\\
162 - Yeah, maybe your dad's right.\\
163 - Good question. Let's see.\\
164 - Infoseek, WebCrawler, oh, HotBot.\\
165 - Okay, literally any other topic.\\
166 - All right.\\
167 - How did you guys meet?\\
168 - Actually, we met online.\\
169 - Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.\\
170 - Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.\\
171 - Oh, he looks sad again.\\
172 - Well, I really envy your relationship.\\
173 - Other than you two only having s*x once a year, you're the perfect couple.\\
174 - You-you know about that?\\
175 - Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.\\
176 - Were you aware of this?\\
177 - No. No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria.\\
178 - How everyone else found out is a mystery to me.\\
179 - Why aren't you talking to me?\\
180 - Because I'm mad at you.\\
181 - Oh.\\
182 - Well, now I'm sorry I asked.\\
183 - Sheldon, it's humiliating.\\
184 - Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our s*x life.\\
185 - What is there to gossip about?\\
186 - We barely have one.\\
187 - That's why they're doing it!\\
188 - Is it safe to assume you're not speaking to me again?\\
189 - If you're not answering because you're not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal!\\
190 - (door slams)\\
191 - That works!\\
192 - You don't need your dad's money.\\
193 - You can get by on your salary.\\
194 - Leonard: Yeah.\\
195 - Well, we work at the same place as you, and we've always been fine.\\
196 - Koothrappali: Oh, please.\\
197 - Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do.\\
198 - Penny: All right.\\
199 - Hang on. We can figure this out.\\
200 - Let's just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?\\
201 - I don't want to say.\\
202 - Is it really that high?\\
203 - I don't want to say because I don't know how much it is.\\
204 - You don't how much your rent is?\\
205 - My father pays for it! Do you know how much your rent is?!\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - Well, then double it, because my building's a lot nicer than this dump.\\
208 - Do you know how much your car costs?\\
209 - Not really.\\
210 - Well, how much do you spend on food?\\
211 - The housekeeper does the shopping.\\
212 - Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.\\
213 - I'm spoiled?!\\
214 - Your baby has a cape that costs $300!\\
215 - I'm going to bed.\\
216 - Well, wait.\\
217 - This is our first fight as a couple who live together.\\
218 - So?\\
219 - I'm not sure of the protocol.\\
220 - Television teaches us that the man's supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, you're clearly more sofa-sized.\\
221 - I'm not sleeping on the couch 'cause you don't know what's private and what's not.\\
222 - This isn't fair.\\
223 - You've discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.\\
224 - That's different!\\
225 - She's a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches!\\
226 - That lady has a name.\\
227 - I don't know what it is, but one time, I accidentally called her “Mom”.\\
228 - Sounds like you're gonna need a cheaper place to live.\\
229 - When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money.\\
230 - How'd you get by?\\
231 - Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.\\
232 - Just know you might have to marry one of 'em.\\
233 - Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you.\\
234 - Why not Raj, too?\\
235 - What-what are you doing? I...\\
236 - I-I-I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer.\\
237 - Why don't you like me?\\
238 - Koothrappali: Well, I thought we were best friends!\\
239 - We are!\\
240 - That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless.\\
241 - I'm sorry, Raj. We really just don't have the space.\\
242 - What if he lives in your garage?\\
243 - What if you stop helping?!\\
244 - Guys, I'm not living in a garage!\\
245 - Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldon's old room is sitting there perfectly empty?\\
246 - That's a great idea.\\
247 - Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here.\\
248 - Thank you, but if I'm gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father.\\
249 - Okay, only if you're sure.\\
250 - (quietly): Whew.\\
251 - Yeah.\\
252 - (knocking)\\
253 - Sheldon: Amy?\\
254 - (knocking)\\
255 - Amy?\\
256 - (knocking) Amy?\\
257 - Yeah?\\
258 - Not exactly the welcome wagon, but I'll take it.\\
259 - What is this?\\
260 - I'm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed.\\
261 - I call these circles “Zones of Privacy”.\\
262 - Don't Google that unless you want to see pictures of people's genitals.\\
263 - This circle contains only me and you.\\
264 - It represents subjects we only share with each other-- details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.\\
265 - Although, as I'm saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here.\\
266 - Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?\\
267 - No, I was just excited to list him as a friend.\\
268 - Well, I do appreciate you working on this.\\
269 - I'm sorry you were embarrassed.\\
270 - And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink.\\
271 - What's that little dot in the middle?\\
272 - That's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone.\\
273 - Interesting. You really have secrets you don't tell me?\\
274 - Of course.\\
275 - Can I hear one?\\
276 - No, they're private.\\
277 - Why? Are they naughty?\\
278 - A little.\\
279 - Please?\\
280 - Fine.\\
281 - Two years ago...\\
282 - ...I got my driver's license.\\
283 - What?!\\
284 - Why didn't you say anything?!\\
285 - I like being chauffeured around.\\
286 - It makes me feel important.\\
287 - So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didn't have to?\\
288 - No, you didn't.\\
289 - But keep in mind, I felt extremely important.\\
290 - (line ringing)\\
291 - (beep)\\
292 - What?!\\
293 - Hello, Father.\\
294 - We need to talk.\\
295 - All right.\\
296 - I have come to an important decision.\\
297 - I will not be accepting your money anymore.\\
298 - I'm a man, and I can take care of myself.\\
299 - That's wonderful!\\
300 - Yes, that is wonderful!\\
301 - You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled!\\
302 - I am so proud of you.\\
303 - Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.\\
304 - Sorry.\\
305 - Oh, no, my grown son is going to stop spending all my money.\\
306 - Where did I fail as a father?!\\
307 - Yeah, that's right.\\
308 - Keep asking yourself that!\\
309 - But I still love you very much, so don't cut me out of the will.\\
310 - Oh, you brought your own lunch.\\
311 - Good for you.\\
312 - Yeah, I'm making a bunch of changes.\\
313 - This morning, I fired my dog walker.\\
314 - Oh. How's the dog gonna go to the bathroom?\\
315 - Uh, I gave her an Imodium.\\
316 - That's tomorrow's problem.\\
317 - Excuse me. May I have your attention, please?\\
318 - I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip.\\
319 - And I just want to say, shame on all of you.\\
320 - We're scientists.\\
321 - Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other people's lives.\\
322 - He's right.\\
323 - And I'm sorry for the part I played in this.\\
324 - Thank you, Bert.\\
325 - You're a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out.\\
326 - That doesn't paint me in the best light.\\
327 - Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.\\
328 - Correction: That woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert... she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done.\\
329 - That better?\\
330 - Not really.\\
331 - All right, well, to sum up-- focus on science, keep your nose out of other people's business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert.\\
332 - What brought that on?\\
333 - (sighs)\\
334 - Well, last night Amy was angry with me because I'd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters.\\
335 - That's understandable.\\
336 - Oh, I know that now.\\
337 - At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but... it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Comic-Con Conundrum}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - My father thinks the reason I can't make a relationship work is because I'm spoiled.\\
3 - All right, how much, exactly, does he pay for?\\
4 - Okay, I'll tell you, but please don't judge me.\\
5 - He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards.\\
6 - I'm trying, but I'm judging.\\
7 - Maybe your dad's right.\\
8 - Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.\\
9 - I have come to an important decision.\\
10 - I will not be accepting your money anymore.\\
11 - That's wonderful.\\
12 - Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled.\\
13 - I'm so proud of you.\\
14 - Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.\\
15 - Uh-huh.\\
16 - Interesting.\\
17 - Okay.\\
18 - How bad is it?\\
19 - Let me put it this way-- do you own a barrel and suspenders?\\
20 - Are you serious?\\
21 - I'm not wearing this visor to play women's golf.\\
22 - Hi.\\
23 - Leonard: Hey.\\
24 - Oh, let me guess.\\
25 - You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.\\
26 - We're helping Raj figure out his finances.\\
27 - Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?\\
28 - Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high.\\
29 - You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping...\\
30 - Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right?\\
31 - Because look.\\
32 - He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.\\
33 - I thought your dad paid your cards.\\
34 - I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.\\
35 - What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?\\
36 - That's a penguin I sponsor.\\
37 - They're losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.\\
38 - What is Pink Cheeks?\\
39 - It's intimate waxing.\\
40 - Quit looking at that!\\
41 - Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.\\
42 - Like a business manager?\\
43 - No, absolutely not.\\
44 - You can't afford to hire someone who'll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses.\\
45 - That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.\\
46 - What if there's someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?\\
47 - He sounds like a sociopath.\\
48 - We don't know, his mother never had him tested.\\
49 - You're talking about me. Very funny.\\
50 - Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.\\
51 - Wait, wait, who's gonna break it to the penguin?\\
52 - Okay, Sheldon.\\
53 - Yeah, I'm putting you in charge of my finances.\\
54 - I will not spend another penny that you don't authorize.\\
55 - Very well.\\
56 - Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday.\\
57 - You can't buy one.\\
58 - Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.\\
59 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
60 -  Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
61 -  The Earth began to cool \\

69 - The Comic-Con Conundrum\\
70 - You're actually going to Comic-Con?\\
71 - Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I'd tag along.\\
72 - Well, that's sweet.\\
73 - I bet you'll have fun.\\
74 - So, do you want to come?\\
75 - No, thanks.\\
76 - I already live in a place all the nerds come to.\\
77 - Please? I went to your boring thing last month.\\
78 - My aunt's funeral?\\
79 - Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.\\
80 - Well, I'm not going, but I do think it's nice you want to.\\
81 - It's not that I want to go, I just think it'll make Leonard happy.\\
82 - And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.\\
83 - Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks.\\
84 - I really have become the cool one around here.\\
85 - You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?\\
86 - No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon's job.\\
87 - She's gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.\\
88 - She's gonna hate all the crowds at the panels.\\
89 - She's gonna hate the panels.\\
90 - She's gonna hate how often we say the word "panels."\\
91 - Why don't you just tell her not to come?\\
92 - Well, she's so excited, I can't do that to her.\\
93 - What if you make it sound so bad she won't want to go?\\
94 - That I would do to her.\\
95 - I can't believe Penny's gonna get to go, and I'm not.\\
96 - You can always watch the panels online.\\
97 - Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.\\
98 - Stuart: Panels.\\
99 - Just wanted to be included.\\
100 - Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con.\\
101 - Just let me have the money for this, and I won't ask for anything else.\\
102 - You put me in charge of your finances.\\
103 - If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.\\
104 - See? Miserable.\\
105 - Okay, you're right, I got myself into this, but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.\\
106 - Your father may have spoiled you, but I won't.\\
107 - If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.\\
108 - Yeah, you're a grown man who's highly educated.\\
109 - You could charge people money to punch you.\\
110 - Go ahead, make jokes.\\
111 - I don't know why you think you're going to Comic-Con-- you just had a baby.\\
112 - So?\\
113 - Well, so?\\
114 - So you think Bernadette's just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?\\
115 - Hang-hang on.\\
116 - So I have to bring Penny, you can't afford it, Howard's gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.\\
117 - I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.\\
118 - Mm... how's my favorite girl?\\
119 - Okay.\\
120 - What you doing?\\
121 - Making lasagna.\\
122 - Oh, she's sexy, she can cook.\\
123 - I'm such a lucky guy.\\
124 - (chuckles)\\
125 - You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?\\
126 - No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.\\
127 - Oh, dear God, you're cheating on me with Raj.\\
128 - (giggles): Never gets old.\\
129 - Okay, there is something I want, but it's not a big deal.\\
130 - What is it?\\
131 - Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys.\\
132 - But before you say anything, I'll make up for being gone by doing everything around here-- I mean everything.\\
133 - I'm even gonna answer for you.\\
134 - (high-pitched voice): Yes, Howard, you can go.\\
135 - It's so hard to say no to you.\\
136 - Thank you.\\
137 - So I'll say maybe.\\
138 - What? Why?\\
139 - You said tickets don't go on sale till Friday, right?\\
140 - Yeah.\\
141 - You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?\\
142 - Yeah.\\
143 - See where I'm going with this?\\
144 - Yeah.\\
145 - If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does.\\
146 - Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor.\\
147 - It's where all the vendors and exhibits are.\\
148 - Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.\\
149 - I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"\\
150 - Okay, now, Th-this is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.\\
151 - Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?\\
152 - Yeah.\\
153 - It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm.\\
154 - Here's the hotel room we all share.\\
155 - Well, you and I would get our own room, right?\\
156 - Every hotel is booked.\\
157 - But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon's feet and my head?\\
158 - That's where you go.\\
159 - Well, it's no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.\\
160 - Don't worry, we won't be doing much sleeping anyway.\\
161 - It's like an all-night party.\\
162 - There's trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons.\\
163 - As we like to say, it's "off the chain mail."\\
164 - I even said "off the chain mail," and she still wants to go.\\
165 - That's probably my fault.\\
166 - She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.\\
167 - Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.\\
168 - But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.\\
169 - I know. And I did it with a straight face.\\
170 - But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.\\
171 - Well... all right.\\
172 - I'll give you 25 bucks.\\
173 - That's my best offer.\\
174 - I have no choice.\\
175 - You know, if you want to make extra money, I-I could throw some work your way.\\
176 - Really?\\
177 - I'll do anything.\\
178 - Great, you're hired.\\
179 - First thing you can do is put price tags on these.\\
180 - Start the little ones at $50.\\
181 - You know, it's no big deal.\\
182 - I can put up with anything for three days.\\
183 - Comic-Con's five days.\\
184 - Are you kidding me?\\
185 - Why don't you just tell him you don't want to go?\\
186 - I can't, it'll break his heart.\\
187 - You know, he's always making an effort to do things with me he doesn't enjoy, like going outside.\\
188 - He is an indoor cat.\\
189 - You know, maybe it won't be that bad.\\
190 - Leonard says it's really mainstream now.\\
191 - Comic books aren't just for sad nerds anymore.\\
192 - I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.\\
193 - (doorbell rings)\\
194 - Bernadette: Howie, can you get that?\\
195 - Wolowitz: Kind of busy.\\
196 - Bernadette: Busy like I'll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?\\
197 - (footfalls running)\\
198 - Hey.\\
199 - What's with the gloves?\\
200 - They complete my ensemble.\\
201 - What do you want?\\
202 - I'm looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.\\
203 - Hang on.\\
204 - Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?\\
205 - Bernadette: No.\\
206 - I tried.\\
207 - Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk.\\
208 - Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.\\
209 - Is there any scenario where we're not in full body paint?\\
210 - Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.\\
211 - Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?\\
212 - Yeah, of course, why?\\
213 - This is just something you usually do together, and if I'm screwing it up, I don't have to go.\\
214 - Oh, why? Do you not want to go?\\
215 - Why? Do you not want me to go?\\
216 - (weakly): No, I want you to go.\\
217 - Okay, good, 'cause that's what I want, too.\\
218 - Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk.\\
219 - I don't want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.\\
220 - If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don't want that either.\\
221 - Is that nice?\\
222 - No, but it's honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.\\
223 - Uh, i-it's more complicated than that.\\
224 - I'm always honest with Amy.\\
225 - The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, "You know, "you can call that a beauty mark all you want.\\
226 - When there's hair growing out of it, that's a mole."\\
227 - Do you think she's as honest with you?\\
228 - I should hope so.\\
229 - When she called me an insensitive jerk, I'd like to think she meant it.\\
230 - There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.\\
231 - Yeah, you'd think.\\
232 - Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.\\
233 - I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.\\
234 - Here, let me help you.\\
235 - Thank you.\\
236 - Oh, Double Stuf Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.\\
237 - (Halley crying)\\
238 - There she goes.\\
239 - Stay, I'll get her.\\
240 - Appreciate it.\\
241 - That's fine.\\
242 - She and I can cry together.\\
243 - He's such a sweetie.\\
244 - I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.\\
245 - If he could find a girl with a good job, all his problems would be over.\\
246 - Yeah, that's working out great for me.\\
247 - Penny says they're ready to go.\\
248 - Very well.\\
249 - Prepare for a long night of deceit.\\
250 - Sheldon, women can wear makeup, it's not lying.\\
251 - I was talking about Leonard.\\
252 - And if makeup is so truthful, why is it called "concealer"?\\
253 - Wait, wait, wait, what's Leonard lying about?\\
254 - He doesn't really want Penny to go to Comic-Con.\\
255 - He's just doing it to make her happy.\\
256 - Really?\\
257 - Because she doesn't actually want to go.\\
258 - She's just doing it to make him happy.\\
259 - So they're both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad?\\
260 - That's hilarious.\\
261 - I can't wait to tell them.\\
262 - No, you're not gonna tell them anything.\\
263 - You're gonna stay out of it.\\
264 - Why?\\
265 - Because it's between them.\\
266 - Well, if you haven't noticed, I've been between them for the last ten years.\\
267 - Hey.\\
268 - Hello.\\
269 - Hi.\\
270 - Hey, babe, you want to drive?\\
271 - Sure, or you can.\\
272 - No, it's fine, I know you don't like the way I drive.\\
273 - I don't have a problem with your driving.\\
274 - Are you listening to this?\\
275 - They deceive each other about everything.\\
276 - Shh.\\
277 - Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.\\
278 - He wasn't in a car, but okay.\\
279 - Just say you want to drive.\\
280 - I honestly don't.\\
281 - Amy, do us a favor, please drive.\\
282 - Sure, happy to.\\
283 - If you want to drive, just drive.\\
284 - I don't see why this has to be so complicated.\\
285 - It's not complicated.\\
286 - Amy's driving, that's it!\\
287 - That's not it because you're clearly upset.\\
288 - Penny: You're the one who seems upset.\\
289 - Why would I be upset?\\
290 - Because you don't want her to go to Comic-Con!\\
291 - This is an interesting way to stay out of it.\\
292 - Wait, you don't want me to go?\\
293 - Well, I just don't think you're gonna have a good time.\\
294 - Sheldon: Yeah, well, get this: neither does Penny, that's why she doesn't want to go.\\
295 - You set 'em up, I knock 'em down, good job.\\
296 - Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn't?\\
297 - I just thought it would make you happy.\\
298 - O-O-O-Okay, hold on, so if you don't want to go and I don't need to bring you, is everything good?\\
299 - Hold on, I'm trying to decide if I'm mad at you.\\
300 - No, I'm happy I don't have to go.\\
301 - All right, problem solved.\\
302 - Okay.\\
303 - Yeah.\\
304 - Not entirely, the fight over who's going to drive is still...\\
305 - Oh, my God, stop talking!\\
306 - The place looks great.\\
307 - Did you guys get a maid?\\
308 - Kind of.\\
309 - Wolowitz: Dinner's almost ready.\\
310 - If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like its cousin, bowl of meat.\\
311 - Hey, if you're still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.\\
312 - Thank you, but it doesn't look like I'm going to Comic-Con this year.\\
313 - Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.\\
314 - Howie?\\
315 - Sure.\\
316 - This is for you.\\
317 - What's this?\\
318 - It's back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you've done.\\
319 - Wolowitz: There's more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.\\
320 - Um, I also take care of Halley.\\
321 - And you live here for free.\\
322 - I do, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.\\
323 - This is so generous of you, I-I, um, I don't know what to say.\\
324 - Now you can come with us.\\
325 - Yeah, there's room in the bed by Sheldon's feet.\\
326 - As much as I appreciate this, I can't accept it.\\
327 - Okay?\\
328 - Halley's my goddaughter, I don't take care of her for money.\\
329 - I would.\\
330 - Keep it.\\
331 - Consider it a gift.\\
332 - (stammers)\\
333 - Hold on.\\
334 - Is it back pay or is it a gift?\\
335 - What's the difference?\\
336 - When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.\\
337 - Koothrappali: It doesn't matter.\\
338 - I'm not keeping this.\\
339 - I'm trying to pay my own way and be responsible.\\
340 - Taking handouts won't help that.\\
341 - So you're not going to Comic-Con?\\
342 - (sighs)\\
343 - I've been plenty of times.\\
344 - If I miss one, it's fine.\\
345 - I'm a big boy.\\
346 - I'm a big boy, and if I missed one, I'd throw a big-boy tantrum.\\
347 - You know what?\\
348 - I've gone 12 times.\\
349 - Maybe I'll sit out this year, too.\\
350 - Really?\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.\\
353 - Ooh, how about white-water rafting?\\
354 - Oh... how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?\\
355 - You know what, I'm not gonna go either.\\
356 - I'm a father now.\\
357 - I'd rather spend time with my family.\\
358 - You just don't want to go alone with Sheldon.\\
359 - I'm gonna go check on dinner.\\
360 - Sounds like everyone's staying home.\\
361 - What do you say?\\
362 - Nuts to that, I'm going to Comic-Con!\\
363 - By yourself?\\
364 - Not necessarily.\\
365 - I have four months to find some new friends.\\
366 - I'll go with you.\\
367 - That's very kind of you, Stuart.\\
368 - Check back in with me in July.\\
369 - There's my pretty girlfriend.\\
370 - I'm not going with you to Comic-Con.\\
371 - What? Can't a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?\\
372 - He can, but it's still not changing my mind.\\
373 - Well, maybe what's in my pants will change your mind.\\
374 - It's a list of this year's panelists.\\
375 - It's long, isn't it?
\subsection {Episode 18: The Escape Hatch Identification}
1 - Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj? \\
2 - What? \\
3 - Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti? \\
4 - No.\\
5 - He can't afford his apartment, and he's asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live.\\
6 - I want to say "India," but it seems mean.\\
7 - (chuckling) \\
8 - What's so funny? \\
9 - Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote "India." \\
10 - Don't post that; be supportive.\\
11 - Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes.\\
12 - Fine, what should we do? \\
13 - We're smart.\\
14 - I'm sure we can think of something.\\
15 - You want to let him live here? \\
16 - Oh, we're smarter than that.\\
17 - I know our apartment's small, but I think we can make room.\\
18 - No, Sheldon.\\
19 - We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.\\
20 - We do have Sheldon's old room.\\
21 - If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him.\\
22 - You're a good friend.\\
23 - Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first? \\
24 - You're an even better husband.\\
25 - I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me.\\
26 - Where would he stay? \\
27 - We already have Stuart.\\
28 - Well, we can make some space in the garage.\\
29 - Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.\\
30 - That sounds awful.\\
31 - Let's hope he thinks so, too.\\
32 - For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.\\
33 - Wow.\\
34 - I'm starting to think you didn't mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.\\
35 - Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started Wait! \\
36 - The Earth began to cool The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools We built the Wall We built the pyramids Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery That all started with a big bang Bang! \\
37 - The Big Bang Theory 10x18 The Escape Hatch Identification Original (ringtone playing) Hello.\\
38 - Hey, uh, so we've been talking, and if you need a place to stay, we'd be happy to fix up the garage for you.\\
39 - That would be amazing! I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in.\\
40 - I know it's not ideal, but you'd have plenty of space for your furniture, and there's this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.\\
41 - I cannot thank you enough.\\
42 - It is our pleasure.\\
43 - (line beeps) \\
44 - Hey, can you hold on one sec? \\
45 - Hello? \\
46 - Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live? \\
47 - Uh yeah.\\
48 - Why do you ask? \\
49 - You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.\\
50 - Oh, my God, that's so generous! \\
51 - It's the least we can do.\\
52 - I-I really appreciate it.\\
53 - Uh, can you hold on one second? \\
54 - Hey, so, Howard, what's the bathroom situation gonna be? \\
55 - Well, there's a sink out there-- that takes care of half your problems.\\
56 - But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right? \\
57 - Yeah.\\
58 - We barely use it, so it'll be like it's yours.\\
59 - Cool, cool, yeah.\\
60 - Yeah, hold on one second.\\
61 - Wh? Hey, what's it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? \\
62 - Is there hair everywhere? \\
63 - Does she use your loofah? \\
64 - I don't have a loofah.\\
65 - Okay, well, if I move in, you can't use mine.\\
66 - Hold on a second.\\
67 - Hey, Howard, uh, how's the Wi-Fi in the garage? \\
68 - I don't know.\\
69 - Why are you asking all these questions? \\
70 - Well, to be honest, Leonard's on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom.\\
71 - Great! Go live there.\\
72 - But you made the garage sound so fun.\\
73 - I just didn't want you to feel bad about it.\\
74 - Unless Leonard's apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there! \\
75 - One second.\\
76 - (clears throat) \\
77 - Okay, I think we're close.\\
78 - How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room? \\
79 - Hey, pal, you want to live here or not? \\
80 - Oh, uh, hi, Penny.\\
81 - Yes, please.\\
82 - Hey.\\
83 - Hi.\\
84 - Uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to "occupant," but with our apartment switch, it's unclear whether it's yours or mine.\\
85 - PENNY: What's it for? \\
86 - SHELDON: Roofing.\\
87 - PENNY: Yeah, it's yours.\\
88 - SHELDON: Okay, thanks.\\
89 - "Just throw it out." \\
90 - Speaking of occupants, I'm given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room.\\
91 - Yeah, for a little while.\\
92 - What about his dog? \\
93 - She'll be in her crate; it's not a big deal.\\
94 - I suppose that's acceptable.\\
95 - Well, Sheldon's getting a little better with dogs.\\
96 - He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.\\
97 - If real dogs gave me buttons, I'd like them, too.\\
98 - Well, I think it's very nice that you're helping out our friend.\\
99 - I think it's nice that you're taking whatever medication Amy's clearly giving you.\\
100 - And what is that supposed to mean? \\
101 - PENNY: Well, it's like that science thing.\\
102 - For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.\\
103 - LEONARD: Just when I thought you couldn't get any hotter.\\
104 - PENNY: Mm-hmm.\\
105 - SHELDON: If you're implying that I'd have some problem with him moving into my room, you're wrong.\\
106 - Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and I'm glad that he's making changes to improve it.\\
107 - Do not adjust the dosage.\\
108 - You nailed it.\\
109 - Don't listen to them.\\
110 - (door closes) \\
111 - What's weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.\\
112 - I mean, it's unfair; people just assume I'm going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room.\\
113 - But you are, aren't you? Oh, I'm outraged.\\
114 - Talk to me.\\
115 - Tell me what's going on.\\
116 - Well, that's been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it.\\
117 - And that someone else is not me.\\
118 - And you know how I feel about people who aren't me.\\
119 - There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room.\\
120 - For me, too.\\
121 - The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.\\
122 - Wrong.\\
123 - We were standing outside my room in the hallway.\\
124 - And there is the love of which I speak.\\
125 - I realize it's irrational, but with Raj moving in there, I'm feeling a bit replaced.\\
126 - Well, this isn't an easy time for him.\\
127 - He's losing his apartment, he's in debt, he's probably humiliated.\\
128 - Yes, probably.\\
129 - But until we know for sure, how can I feel better? \\
130 - Can I get anyone anything at all? Raj, you don't have to serve us.\\
131 - It's the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.\\
132 - It was really no problem.\\
133 - Not for you, Box of Towels.\\
134 - Anyway, thanks again.\\
135 - Hey, look at that.\\
136 - You've got a Raj, we've got a Stuart.\\
137 - Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together.\\
138 - I don't know.\\
139 - Yours looks like he has worms.\\
140 - You ready to go? \\
141 - All set.\\
142 - What's that? \\
143 - A housewarming gift for Raj.\\
144 - Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, 'cause that was a lousy anniversary present.\\
145 - It's nothing like that.\\
146 - I just, I thought about Raj's situation, and I had a change of heart.\\
147 - You know, and regarding your gift, you said "surprise me," and, boy, did I.\\
148 - - Hello.\\
149 - - Hey.\\
150 - - Hi.\\
151 - Perfect timing.\\
152 - Food's ready.\\
153 - Uh, wait-- before we eat, I have a little "welcome to the building" gift for Raj.\\
154 - Wait, is anything gonna jump out No.\\
155 - I already asked.\\
156 - Thank you, Sheldon.\\
157 - It's a blank notebook.\\
158 - Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and I'm sure you will, too.\\
159 - He also never had s*x in that room.\\
160 - That's something else to look forward to.\\
161 - This means a lot.\\
162 - Well, I know this is a difficult time for you.\\
163 - Y-You're losing your apartment, you're in debt, and you just-- you must be humiliated.\\
164 - Sheldon Oh, good grief.\\
165 - She is such a stickler for citing sources.\\
166 - Those were Amy's words.\\
167 - Sheldon I know, I know! "Good grief" was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.\\
168 - You're right, I am humiliated.\\
169 - Thanks for pointing it out.\\
170 - You're such a jerk.\\
171 - Can you believe this guy? \\
172 - ALL: Yes.\\
173 - I-I thought that was gonna break the other way.\\
174 - AMY: Come on, Sheldon.\\
175 - Maybe we should just eat at our place.\\
176 - Fine.\\
177 - You took my room.\\
178 - You turned my friends against me.\\
179 - I hope you're happy.\\
180 - What do I have to be happy about? \\
181 - My life's a wreck.\\
182 - How come he can say it and I can't? \\
183 - Just keep walking.\\
184 - (Skype ringing) \\
185 - BEVERLY: Hello, Sheldon.\\
186 - What a pleasant surprise.\\
187 - How are you? \\
188 - Honestly, I've been better.\\
189 - Do you have time? Leonard says you're very busy these days.\\
190 - Oh, I just say that because he prattles.\\
191 - What's going on? Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it's brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.\\
192 - Mm.\\
193 - Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents? \\
194 - Beverly, you know I hold you in high esteem.\\
195 - Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer? Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind, I'd still like to pause for effect.\\
196 - (clears throat) \\
197 - Now You've recently moved in with Dr.\\
198 - Fowler, yes? \\
199 - I have.\\
200 - Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you're forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.\\
201 - I hadn't thought about that.\\
202 - And don't start thinking about it now! \\
203 - Hello, Amy.\\
204 - Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities about your relationship with Sheldon.\\
205 - That's not true! \\
206 - She said defensively.\\
207 - This isn't about me and Sheldon.\\
208 - This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.\\
209 - Interesting.\\
210 - They've found a need to take yet another roommate.\\
211 - Seems they're avoiding some harsh realities themselves.\\
212 - I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster.\\
213 - Boy, you're good.\\
214 - That is the word on the street, dear.\\
215 - Maybe moving in was a bad idea.\\
216 - I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.\\
217 - You didn't do anything.\\
218 - It's Sheldon.\\
219 - "You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon." \\
220 - That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.\\
221 - So, relax.\\
222 - We're happy to have you.\\
223 - Thank you, but how do I know you're not saying that just to be nice? \\
224 - Do you actually pay for that haircut? \\
225 - That'll do it.\\
226 - Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.\\
227 - Look, could you please put your dog on a leash? \\
228 - Sheldon, she's fine.\\
229 - Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend she's stuffed.\\
230 - Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you.\\
231 - Thank you.\\
232 - I appreciate that.\\
233 - No, I can't take all the credit.\\
234 - I spoke with Leonard's mother, and she made me feel better.\\
235 - I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.\\
236 - Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.\\
237 - What are you talking about? \\
238 - We're fine.\\
239 - Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems.\\
240 - It used to be me.\\
241 - Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble.\\
242 - Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.\\
243 - Oh, and FYI-- if you cry while they're fighting, they'll take you to McDonald's.\\
244 - (Skype ringing) Hello, Leonard.\\
245 - Why are you saying we have marital problems? We don't have marital problems! \\
246 - I see.\\
247 - You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.\\
248 - Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.\\
249 - Yeah, this is a special circumstance.\\
250 - Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother to live with you, as well.\\
251 - Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special.\\
252 - Do you agree with that? Well, now that you point it out Are you kidding me? We do seem to keep finding roommates.\\
253 - Now you're taking her side? Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard.\\
254 - That's for your parade of roommates to do.\\
255 - KOOTHRAPPALI (whispering): Howard? Howard! \\
256 - (Howard and Bernadette scream) It's me! It's just me! What are you doing here?! \\
257 - Well, I texted you, but you didn't respond.\\
258 - Leonard and Penny were arguing Not on my watch! \\
259 - It's fine.\\
260 - It's just Raj.\\
261 - You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.\\
262 - And if my heart stops, just let me go.\\
263 - I'm sorry, guys.\\
264 - Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting.\\
265 - I just wanted to go someplace where I wasn't causing problems.\\
266 - (sighs) I'll say it again.\\
267 - India.\\
268 - Can I just stay in the garage? Don't do that.\\
269 - We'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.\\
270 - Thank you.\\
271 - Come on, I'll get you some sheets.\\
272 - Then we'll see if I can beat my high score on the blood pressure machine.\\
273 - Never should've had all these kids so close together.\\
274 - You okay? \\
275 - I can't sleep.\\
276 - What's wrong? Beverly believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.\\
277 - Is that bothering you? \\
278 - Yes.\\
279 - I don't care for unconscious thoughts.\\
280 - My brain and I are best friends.\\
281 - It should tell me everything.\\
282 - I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain.\\
283 - What if she's correct? Doesn't that say something troubling about us? \\
284 - I don't know.\\
285 - I just think you're the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.\\
286 - That is true.\\
287 - Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse? \\
288 - You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much.\\
289 - It's not a good influence.\\
290 - If you're looking for spare change, I already cleaned it out.\\
291 - Well (clears throat) Didn't think this is where my life would be.\\
292 - Me, either.\\
293 - I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch.\\
294 - I'm actually winning.\\
295 - You know, we're both down on our luck.\\
296 - Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.\\
297 - (chuckles): Okay, listen to me.\\
298 - There is no reason to leave here.\\
299 - This is great.\\
300 - Everyone's nice.\\
301 - It's comfortable.\\
302 - If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.\\
303 - Wouldn't you feel better about yourself if you were more independent? Better than I feel in their steam shower? \\
304 - I don't think so.\\
305 - Penny would be the entree.\\
306 - Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.\\
307 - And because I love you, you're dessert.\\
308 - I want to say "aw," but I'm gonna say "ew." \\
309 - No, you see, I'm doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person.\\
310 - Good for you.\\
311 - This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.\\
312 - Don't you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends? \\
313 - Hey, look, I went to art college, I tried to make it as a graphic artist, a comic book artist, and you know what I got for my efforts? \\
314 - A visible rib cage.\\
315 - I'm not kidding.\\
316 - You could see my heart beating.\\
317 - Well, no offense, but I didn't go to art school.\\
318 - I have a PhD in astrophysics.\\
319 - Oh, great, it'll be easier for you to look up at the stars without a roof over your head.\\
320 - Morning.\\
321 - Did you know Raj moved out last night? \\
322 - What? Why? \\
323 - "Leonard and Penny, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.\\
324 - "I went to stay at Howard's." P.S., Cinnamon's with me, "but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him she's loose in the building." I feel terrible.\\
325 - Should we go bring him back? \\
326 - Well, you're the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems.\\
327 - Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head.\\
328 - It's like being possessed, but instead of Satan, it's-- Actually, it's the same thing.\\
329 - All right, so we'll ask him to come back.\\
330 - Well, great.\\
331 - Don't you want to get dressed first? \\
332 - Just one second.\\
333 - Help! Cinnamon's loose in the building! \\
334 - SHELDON: Amy, quick, lock the door! \\
335 - We're so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable.\\
336 - We really weren't fighting about you.\\
337 - I just never want to be a burden on my friends.\\
338 - Me, either.\\
339 - Don't want to be a burden.\\
340 - Hey, is that the baby? \\
341 - I'll go check.\\
342 - You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us.\\
343 - But I also upset Sheldon, and he's not gonna want to come over if I'm there.\\
344 - More reasons for you to stay.\\
345 - Halley's fine.\\
346 - You know she's at my parents' house, right? And she's having the time of her life.\\
347 - If you ever want to change things up, you're always welcome here.\\
348 - Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.\\
349 - I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.\\
350 - Then it's settled.\\
351 - And just so you know, it's only temporary.\\
352 - I'm not gonna get too comfortable.\\
353 - Good.\\
354 - Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.\\
355 - Hey, that's no way to talk about your baby.\\
356 - You know what? I'm proud of us.\\
357 - Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, we're the only couple of our social group who doesn't need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party.\\
358 - Yup, we're killin' it.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Collaboration Fluctuation}
1 - You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana. \\
2 - Oh, that's beautiful.\\
3 - What does it mean?  \\
4 - "Downward-facing dog."  \\
5 - Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit for "butts up and heads down."  \\
6 - Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. \\
7 - If it involves butts, there's a word for it.  \\
8 - I thought we were getting breakfast before work.   \\
9 - Oh, right, sorry.   \\
10 - It's my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.   \\
11 - If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.   \\
12 - (chuckles)\\
13 - It's cute that you think that.   \\
14 - Don't worry about it.   \\
15 - Hey, can I ask you a favor?   \\
16 - Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?   \\
17 - Sure.\\
18 - You're living here for free.   \\
19 - I guess I owe you.   \\
20 - Bye, Cinnamon.\\
21 - Be a good girl.   \\
22 - Yeah, bye, sweetie!\\
23 - Bye!   \\
24 - Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.\\
25 - (chuckles)   \\
26 - Okay, and tree pose.   \\
27 - Well, she's done.   \\
28 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
29 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
30 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
31 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
32 -  We built the Wall \\
33 -  We built the pyramids    \\
34 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
35 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
36 -  Bang!    \\
37 - Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.   \\
38 - That's great. How so?   \\
39 - Oh, the project is classified.   \\
40 - I can't tell you.   \\
41 - Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts.   \\
42 - All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the... (speaks indistinctly)\\
43 - (horn honks)   \\
44 - I used the...   \\
45 - (speaks indistinctly)\\
46 - (horn honks)   \\
47 - And then I... (speaking indistinctly)\\
48 - (horn honking)   \\
49 - And that did it.   \\
50 - (horn honking)   \\
51 - Wow, I wonder what they're redacting.   \\
52 - Why don't you ask me what I'm working on?   \\
53 - Oh, very well.\\
54 - What have you been working on?   \\
55 - And feel free to honk during the boring parts.   \\
56 - I'm doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.   \\
57 - W... So you're attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.   \\
58 - Yes, I'm trying to figure out the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.   \\
59 - Well, what do you know?   \\
60 - Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy.   \\
61 - Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.   \\
62 - You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. \\
63 - Maybe I was onto something.   \\
64 - Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.   \\
65 - Unless it was singing "Be Our Guest," I doubt it.   \\
66 - Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it.   \\
67 - Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?   \\
68 - The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon?   \\
69 - You didn't get any food.   \\
70 - He does raise an interesting point.   \\
71 - Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.   \\
72 - Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I'll wait.   \\
73 - I understand it, Sheldon.   \\
74 - Yeah, me, too.   \\
75 - I'm sorry, I spaced.   \\
76 - Are we still talking about the spoon?   \\
77 - It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.   \\
78 - Well, don't get me wrong.   \\
79 - Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff.   \\
80 - But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.   \\
81 - So did you confront Jennifer?   \\
82 - I was going to, but she called in sick.   \\
83 - And guess who else called in sick.   \\
84 - Paul.\\
85 - Paul.   \\
86 - Who's Paul?   \\
87 - Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party.   \\
88 - He's married to Nancy.   \\
89 - Oh, sure.\\
90 - Wait, Nancy?    \\
91 - I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.    \\
92 - Don't worry, Jerry won't be fooled by that type of behavior.    \\
93 - Jerry?    \\
94 - It didn't work for Randy, it didn't work for Tina, it sure as hell isn't gonna work for Jennifer.    \\
95 - Well, I hope not.\\
96 - I just hate when people play those kinds of games.    \\
97 - Tina?    \\
98 - With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.    \\
99 - Mm.    \\
100 - I went to your office Christmas party?    \\
101 - You know, I like harp lessons, but I'm thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons.    \\
102 - What are you working on?    \\
103 - I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.    \\
104 - Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?    \\
105 - It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee.    \\
106 - It was like drinking  /  of the rainbow.    \\
107 - Sheldon, this is really interesting.    \\
108 - Yeah, and this one won't stain my teeth purple.    \\
109 - You know, we've never collaborated professionally before.    \\
110 - Are you worried it might affect our relationship?    \\
111 - That is a valid point.    \\
112 - Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.    \\
113 - Well, that would make me feel better.    \\
114 - All right, let's start right now.    \\
115 - Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.    \\
116 - That's a ridiculous rule.    \\
117 - Is it?    \\
118 - Okay, how is that?    \\
119 - I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.    \\
120 - Well, this is a moisturizing mask.    \\
121 - Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin.    \\
122 - Hey, I hope you don't mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.    \\
123 - I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.    \\
124 - I'd still like to know who Jerry is.    \\
125 - Don't worry about it.\\
126 - Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?    \\
127 - That would be great.\\
128 - Thank you.    \\
129 - You want to go shopping?    \\
130 - Ooh, yes. Fun.    \\
131 - Or we could do something we'll all enjoy, like play a board game.    \\
132 -  Imagine me and you, I do     \\
133 -  I think about you day and night     \\
134 -  It's only right to think about the one you love     \\
135 -  And hold her tight     \\
136 -  So happy together     \\
137 -  I can't see me lovin' nobody but you     \\
138 -  For all my life     \\
139 -  When you're with me     \\
140 -  Baby, the skies will be blue     \\
141 -  For all my life.     \\
142 - I believe I've made some progress on our ground rules.\\
143 - Oh, good.    \\
144 - What are they?\\
145 - Okay, uh, number one: in matters of physics, I have the final say.    \\
146 - In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say.    \\
147 - Unless I disagree.    \\
148 - Oh, here.    \\
149 - Number two: when we publish, my name goes first.    \\
150 - Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first.    \\
151 - I don't want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.    \\
152 - Can I see that?    \\
153 - Oh, of course.    \\
154 - I'll get that back.    \\
155 - Like all my underwear, that notebook says    \\
156 - "Property of Sheldon Cooper."    \\
157 - Sheldon, if we're gonna have ground rules, I'll tell you the first ground rule-- I make the ground rules.    \\
158 - I'd write that down, but I can't now, can I?    \\
159 - I mean, they didn't say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.    \\
160 - Huh, so you can tell what that feels like.    \\
161 - Interesting.    \\
162 - Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.    \\
163 - Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.    \\
164 - Oh, it's just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around.    \\
165 - Isn't that right, Halley?    \\
166 - (Halley crying)    \\
167 - Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.    \\
168 - Thank you, you are a good citizen.    \\
169 - Told you.    \\
170 - Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window.    \\
171 - Same thing's gonna happen.    \\
172 - Terrific.    \\
173 - Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?    \\
174 - Fire away.    \\
175 - Number one: we're on the same team, we're not in competition.    \\
176 - That's smart, because Sheldon:  , Amy:  .    \\
177 - Number two: disagreements can happen politely.    \\
178 - There's no need to call an idea stupid.    \\
179 - Aw, someone drew a pen1s in it.    \\
180 - Are you listening?    \\
181 - I'm sorry, go ahead.    \\
182 - Number three.    \\
183 - To avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.    \\
184 - Ooh, that sounds fun.    \\
185 - Now, we're talking about real treats, right?    \\
186 - Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.    \\
187 - Whatever you want.    \\
188 - So, shall we get to work?    \\
189 - Biology and physics coming together-- this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind.    \\
190 - Oh, I know what I want my treat to be!    \\
191 -  Imagine me and you, I do     \\
192 -  I think about you day and night     \\
193 -  It's only right     \\
194 -  To think about the girl you love     \\
195 -  And hold her tight     \\
196 -  So happy together     \\
197 -  If I should call you up, invest a dime     \\
198 -  And you say you belong to me     \\
199 -  And ease my mind     \\
200 -  Imagine how the world could be, so very fine     \\
201 -  So happy together     \\
202 -  I can't see me     \\
203 -  Lovin' nobody but you     \\
204 -  For all my life...     \\
205 - Wow.\\
206 - Look at that.    \\
207 - Yes, this is remarkable.    \\
208 - So we're agreed: it's complete garbage.    \\
209 - By the way, your name can go first.    \\
210 - I mean, I'm glad they're getting along, but it's starting to make me uncomfortable.    \\
211 - Well, are you worried he's like another man in her life?    \\
212 - A little, until I saw them in matching tops, so...    \\
213 - Nice.     diapers.    \\
214 - That ought to get us to Wednesday.    \\
215 - Well, have you talked to them about it?    \\
216 - Well, what am I supposed to say-- "Stop having fun without me"?    \\
217 - This one says that every time I go out.    \\
218 - See? I listen to you.    \\
219 - Look, Raj just gets along with women.    \\
220 - I-I know, but he was my friend first.    \\
221 - It's like she's stealing him and they're just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.    \\
222 - You sure you don't fit in?    \\
223 - You sound like a catty bitch to me.    \\
224 - I don't know where we went wrong.    \\
225 - Yeah, the math is so inelegant.    \\
226 - I'm not even sure it makes sense.    \\
227 - Well, don't give up.\\
228 - Maybe we can fix it.    \\
229 - Can you stop breathing so loud?    \\
230 - I can hear your nose whistling.    \\
231 - I can hear your face talking, so we're even.    \\
232 - All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play "Camptown Races."    \\
233 - Fine. Fine.\\
234 - You want me to blow my nose?    \\
235 - Here, I'll blow it.    \\
236 - (nose blowing aggressively)    \\
237 - Better?    \\
238 - No, I can still hear it.    \\
239 - Oh, wait, that's me.\\
240 - Never mind, it's fine.    \\
241 - You know, you're exhausting.    \\
242 - I knew working together was a bad idea.    \\
243 - Hold on.    \\
244 - I see what's wrong here.\\
245 - We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.    \\
246 - That would mean that this delayed parameter    \\
247 - should be increased    milliseconds.    \\
248 - Oh, that is much better.    \\
249 - Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we'd be in good shape.    \\
250 - Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavors, the tannins, the textures.    \\
251 - Well?    \\
252 - I probably should have spit out my gum first.    \\
253 - (both laugh)    \\
254 - Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.    \\
255 - Mm. Well, we've loved having you around.\\
256 - Right, sweetie?    \\
257 - Leonard?    \\
258 - Yeah, when did he leave?    \\
259 - Yeah, that's rude.    \\
260 - You know, it's nice to spend time with people who don't talk about work like it's some kind of soap opera.    \\
261 - Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?    \\
262 - Yeah.    \\
263 - You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don't want to.    \\
264 - Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.    \\
265 - Wait.    \\
266 - What? What do I make you do?    \\
267 - Let's see: the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector's meet and greet.    \\
268 - It said right there on the invitation, "Buckle up for fun."    \\
269 - It's not my fault you didn't listen.    \\
270 - I'm sure I'm overreacting.    \\
271 - You're entitled to feel how you feel.    \\
272 - If you don't like it, you should just talk to her.    \\
273 - I don't want to sound like a jealous baby.    \\
274 - Oh, then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.    \\
275 - You know, I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn't say anything 'cause you're so sensitive.    \\
276 - (grunts) Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I'm sensitive!    \\
277 - Hey,    \\
278 - I wonder what kind of success we'd have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.    \\
279 - (gasps) That is a daring and insightful solution.    \\
280 - We're finally making progress.    \\
281 - I wish we could do it without fighting.    \\
282 - What if the fighting is the reason we're making progress?    \\
283 - I suppose it's conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.    \\
284 - Well, if that's the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.    \\
285 - How dare you speak that way about my Grammy-- hey, wait a second. Wait.    \\
286 - Delta "T" could equal alpha sub-zero.    \\
287 - It seems we have a choice to make.    \\
288 - Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or... give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.    \\
289 - There's only one clear choice.    \\
290 - Science it is.\\
291 - No, you bonehead!    \\
292 - Name-calling, that is perfect.    \\
293 - Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it.\\
294 - You know?    \\
295 - I-If it helps, I'm not the sharpest dresser.    \\
296 - Anyway, I know it's silly, but since Raj moved in, I've been feeling a little left out.    \\
297 - Well, sweetie, that's crazy.    \\
298 - No, no, Penny, don't dismiss his feelings.    \\
299 - Thank you. I just feel...    \\
300 - Hang on, I'm not saying that his feelings aren't crazy.    \\
301 - I just don't want him to think that this isn't a safe place.    \\
302 - Well, to be truthful...    \\
303 - PENNY: Well, why wouldn't this be a safe place? I mean, he's surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.    \\
304 - I don't want to speak for Leonard.    \\
305 - Thank you. I...    \\
306 - But when you're insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.    \\
307 - Yeah, you're right. You know, you're really sensitive about this kind of stuff.    \\
308 - I'm a good listener.\\
309 - (chuckles) Yeah.    \\
310 - Hey, Olsen twins...    \\
311 - What?    \\
312 - Well, I-I mean, I'm sitting right here.    \\
313 - You're talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.    \\
314 - I'm sorry.\\
315 - What did you want to say?    \\
316 - I don't know, you pretty much covered it.    \\
317 -  So happy together.     \\
318 - Various: (Shouting) Heigh!    \\
319 - Can you read them back?    \\
320 - "Revised ground rule number one: We are on the same team, but it is a competition."    \\
321 - Excellent. Excellent.    \\
322 - And on a related point, you're going down, punk.    \\
323 - "Revised ground rule number two: "There are definitely stupid questions.    \\
324 - "And those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."    \\
325 - I love that one.    \\
326 - Thanks, babe.    \\
327 - "Number three: "Fair topics for insult include "educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."    \\
328 - Yeah, that list is strong.    \\
329 - Like your mother's urge to be promiscuous with sailors.
\subsection {Episode 20: The Recollection Dissipation}
1 - Hey, Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work.  \\
2 - Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project.  \\
3 - Oh, are you sure?  \\
4 - We're celebrating our new A.D.D. drug, and it'll probably be over in, like, six minutes.  \\
5 - Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?\\
6 - - Yeah, why?  \\
7 - Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project.   \\
8 - We've had this planned for a week.   \\
9 - Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning.   \\
10 - Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon.   \\
11 - Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?   \\
12 - Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity?   \\
13 - Actually, never mind, don't answer.   \\
14 - I'd love to.   \\
15 - Hello.   \\
16 - Why did you tell Leonard you're working on the gyroscope tomorrow?\\
17 - - Because I am.   \\
18 - But you said you were working with me.   \\
19 - PENNY: Uh-oh.   \\
20 - Someone's got two dates to the nerd prom.   \\
21 - I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously.   \\
22 - And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom.   \\
23 - I'm sorry, what is this plan you have?   \\
24 - Well, I'm not needed at both places at the same time.   \\
25 - And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point.   \\
26 - When does that start?   \\
27 - Soon.   \\
28 - See, I could've said "in the near future," but I didn't say "in the near future," 'cause "in the near future" is three more words than "soon."   \\
29 - "In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four. See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one; saving time already.   \\
30 - Genius.   \\
31 - I was gonna say, "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"   \\
32 - But I didn't.   \\
33 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
34 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
35 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
36 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
37 -  We built the Wall \\
38 -  We built the pyramids    \\
39 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
40 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
41 -  Bang!    \\
42 - Gentlemen, I've got Amy up and running.   \\
43 - Shall we get to work?   \\
44 - Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?   \\
45 - These are hydration backpacks.   \\
46 - Eh, for efficiency, whenever I'm thirsty, I have access to water.   \\
47 - Eh, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup.   \\
48 - It's getting harder to pretend.   \\
49 - Anyway, Sheldon, we're at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler or through the vacuum filter.   \\
50 - Run down the pros and cons of each for me.   \\
51 - Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryocooler, it'll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction.   \\
52 - (slurping)   \\
53 - Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.   \\
54 - You can just feel the time being saved.   \\
55 - Ah, I'm back, you got me for eight minutes.   \\
56 - Sheldon, this is silly.   \\
57 - You can't expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this.   \\
58 - The coefficient isn't lambda, it's lambda sub one.   \\
59 - And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states.   \\
60 - And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?   \\
61 - The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.   \\
62 - It can't be four revolutions, it's got to be seven.   \\
63 - Seven?!   \\
64 - Look at the board, it's four.   \\
65 - Oh, my God, it's seven!   \\
66 - Four!\\
67 - Seven!   \\
68 - It's five and a half.   \\
69 - Son of a bitch, it's five and a half.   \\
70 - B.R.B., that's short for "Be right back."   \\
71 - I'm saving so much time!   \\
72 - The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero.   \\
73 - And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.   \\
74 - Incredible.   \\
75 - Sheldon, I didn't expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong.    \\
76 - You know, I felt the same way about the spork.    \\
77 - Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil?    \\
78 - That'll never work.    \\
79 - Spoiler: works.    \\
80 - I got to admit, we didn't think you'd be able to do two things at once.    \\
81 - Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus.    \\
82 - You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way.    \\
83 - And spoiler: way.    \\
84 - Hey.\\
85 - Hey.    \\
86 - Oh, thanks again for letting me use your laptop last night.    \\
87 - No problem.    \\
88 - Was just doing my taxes.    \\
89 - Okay.    \\
90 - Actually, if I could... if I could just check one more...    \\
91 - Already cleared the browser history.    \\
92 - You're a good woman.    \\
93 - What you working on?    \\
94 - Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.    \\
95 - Oh, that's right, maternity leave's almost over.    \\
96 - Ah, you excited?    \\
97 - Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley, but it'll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated.    \\
98 - Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.    \\
99 - That's great, good for you.    \\
100 - Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she's gonna be fine.    \\
101 - Ah, of course she is.    \\
102 - And that day care is great.    \\
103 - It is. I went to check it out, and they are very cautious about letting strange men with no kids peek in the windows.    \\
104 - Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers.    \\
105 - Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back.    \\
106 - That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home    \\
107 - (voice breaking): and her bedtime even more special.    \\
108 - Uh, other than burp you or give you a bottle, I don't know what to do right now.    \\
109 - It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this.    \\
110 - Can you not tell Howard?    \\
111 - Well, don't you think it'd be healthier if you told him what's going on with you?    \\
112 - Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?    \\
113 - Your secret is safe with me.    \\
114 - Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?    \\
115 - Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack.    \\
116 - You know, there was a time I would say "What's a soup sack?"    \\
117 - But... I'm glad we're past that.    \\
118 - (sneezes)    \\
119 - You know, there was a time I would say "God bless you," and then you would say "If you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor?"    \\
120 - And I would say, "How do you know I didn't mean Thor?"    \\
121 - And then you would say "Touché," and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say "God bless you."    \\
122 - Well, we have had some fun, haven't we?    \\
123 - Oh, yeah.    \\
124 - So, Leonard tells me you've had a busy day.    \\
125 - Hmm? Oh, I did.    \\
126 - It hasn't stopped.    \\
127 - I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants.    \\
128 - (sneezes)    \\
129 - Are you getting sick?    \\
130 - Of course not.    \\
131 - I'm too busy to be sick.    \\
132 - Well, you're pretty delicate.    \\
133 - Maybe you shouldn't be pushing yourself so hard.    \\
134 - I'm fine.\\
135 - All right.    \\
136 - Well, we'll just pretend that you didn't catch a cold  watching Frozen.\\
137 - I...    \\
138 - That didn't happen.    \\
139 - You also got a nosebleed watching Up. \\
140 - Just do your laundry!    \\
141 - Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner.    \\
142 - Yeah, well, I felt bad about upsetting you this morning.    \\
143 - And to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of your meatloaf.    \\
144 - Hey, what's for dinner?    \\
145 - Meatloaf.    \\
146 - Oh, cool.    \\
147 - Stuart made it.    \\
148 - Oh, cool.    \\
149 - Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work.    \\
150 - Sounds great.    \\
151 - WOLOWITZ: Speaking of which, for day care, it'll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it.    \\
152 - Hmm, guess it should be me.    \\
153 - STUART: I can't do it; they have a picture of me on file now.    \\
154 - You okay?    \\
155 - Of course, why?    \\
156 - Well, I don't know, you seem a little upset.    \\
157 - No, I'm fine.\\
158 - You sure?    \\
159 - Why don't you think she's fine?    \\
160 - She sounds fine, she looks fine.    \\
161 - If I saw her on the street I'd say, "Damn, that girl's fine!"    \\
162 - Sheldon, you're sick, go back to bed.    \\
163 - (stuffy): I am fine.    \\
164 - Here, eat your toast.    \\
165 - (sneezes)    \\
166 - Sorry.    \\
167 - It's okay, now I don't need butter.    \\
168 - Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather.    \\
169 - It's nothing a little cold medicine and tea can't fix.    \\
170 - You need sleep.    \\
171 - What I need is to get to work.    \\
172 - Well, I don't want your germs around me.    \\
173 - What? You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at     fever?    \\
174 - What happened to our love?    \\
175 - Sheldon, are you okay?    \\
176 - What's going on?    \\
177 - How'd I get here?    \\
178 - I don't know, we came home from work and we found you.    \\
179 - Home from work?    \\
180 - What time is it?    \\
181 - It's  :  .    \\
182 -  :  ?!    \\
183 - W-What happened to  :   and  :   and all the other o'clocks?    \\
184 - Wait, you don't remember?    \\
185 - Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest.    \\
186 - And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra.    \\
187 - I took some cold medicine to...\\
188 - (gasps)    \\
189 - I took cold medicine.    \\
190 - You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.    \\
191 - At-- at the lab?!    \\
192 - Why am I naked from the waist down?    \\
193 - I don't know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove.    \\
194 - My pants are missing, I don't remember anything.    \\
195 - Penny, this is your youth.\\
196 - What do I do?    \\
197 - I don't know, check your body for tattoos?    \\
198 - Leonard, would you be a lamb...    \\
199 - She's kidding!    \\
200 - Wait, wait. Where's my bag?\\
201 - My phone and my wallet are in my bag. \\
202 - It's right here.    \\
203 - (gasps)    \\
204 - (sighs)    \\
205 - Where's my notebook?\\
206 - My notebook's gone. Oh, no.    \\
207 - Okay, it's just a notebook, what's the big deal?    \\
208 - What's the big deal?    \\
209 - It's full of classified information about the air force project!    \\
210 - How could you lose that?    \\
211 - It's okay, I'm sure we'll find it.    \\
212 - Look, it's got to be around here somewhere.    \\
213 - Maybe it's wherever your pants are.    \\
214 - Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook.    \\
215 - Hey.    \\
216 - Ah, hello.    \\
217 - (sighs) Look, something's going on with Bernadette.    \\
218 - She say anything to you?    \\
219 - Well, nope, not a word.    \\
220 - Come on, be honest.    \\
221 - Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?    \\
222 - No, but I did mention it to my therapist.    \\
223 - Well, I know she's mad at me about something.    \\
224 - Well, what have you done that would upset her?    \\
225 - Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?    \\
226 - (sighs)    \\
227 - Well, why don't you just start with the worst thing?    \\
228 - Hmm, let's see. Mm.    \\
229 - Okay, here we go: six years ago, I got a call that Bernie's great-aunt, Trixie, died.    \\
230 - And?    \\
231 - (whispering): And I forgot to give her the message.    \\
232 - That's terrible.    \\
233 - The terrible part is, ever since then,    \\
234 - I've been sending Bernie    \\
235 - (laughing):\\
236 - Christmas cards from Trixie.    \\
237 - Oh...    \\
238 - Howard!    \\
239 - Let me finish-- and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernie's purse.    \\
240 - The notebook isn't in the bathroom.    \\
241 - I can't find it, either.    \\
242 - How can he not remember a day?    \\
243 - Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time.    \\
244 - I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.    \\
245 - (door opens)    \\
246 - Well, it's not across the hall.    \\
247 - That's it. I'm in breach of my security clearance.    \\
248 - I'm going to prison.    \\
249 - And you know what happens to people like me in prison.    \\
250 - I'll be forced to be some large man's tutor.    \\
251 - You're not going to prison.    \\
252 - But, boy, it is funny to think about.    \\
253 - (chuckles)    \\
254 - You really can't remember anything?    \\
255 - I'm trying.    \\
256 - Wait a minute.\\
257 - Hey, let me see your phone.    \\
258 - Why?    \\
259 - Well, it's-- it's possible it was tracking everywhere you went.    \\
260 - Phones can do that?    \\
261 - Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings.    \\
262 - Oh, tha-- that's so cool.    \\
263 - How do you-- how do you turn that thing off?    \\
264 - Relax.    \\
265 - I know when you "go for a run," you stop for a donut.    \\
266 - I don't even run there, I drive.    \\
267 - Hang on, I can see every place you went.    \\
268 - What does it say?    \\
269 - Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard.    \\
270 - Where?    \\
271 - Wait, hang on.    \\
272 - Did you go to a cowboy bar?    \\
273 - I-- no!    \\
274 - That is preposterous.    \\
275 - Ow!\\
276 - (country music playing)    \\
277 - Maybe.    \\
278 - Hey, how's it going?    \\
279 - Fine.    \\
280 - Good. Love you.    \\
281 - - Love you, too.\\
282 - - Love you more. (chuckles)    \\
283 - Okay, you won.\\
284 - Can I finish what I'm doing?    \\
285 - Sure, sorry.\\
286 - (chuckles)    \\
287 - (humming)    \\
288 - Something on your mind?    \\
289 - No, no, nothing.\\
290 - (chuckles)    \\
291 - Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like something's bothering you.    \\
292 - Nope, all good.    \\
293 - Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.    \\
294 - No, what is wrong with you?    \\
295 - Aha, you are upset.    \\
296 - I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.    \\
297 - Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.    \\
298 - It doesn't?    \\
299 - No.\\
300 - (sighs)    \\
301 - I didn't want to tell you, but...    \\
302 - I'm having a really tough time about going back to work.    \\
303 - Oh. Okay, well, I get that.    \\
304 - It was hard for me when I went back.    \\
305 - - It was?\\
306 - - Of course.    \\
307 - I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.    \\
308 - I just don't know what the right thing to do is.    \\
309 - If I go back to work, I'm abandoning Halley.    \\
310 - If I don't go, I'm giving up everything I worked for.    \\
311 - It's like there's no right choice.    \\
312 - Look, I don't know what the best decision is, either.    \\
313 - But whatever we choose, if we're not happy, we can undo it.    \\
314 - I guess.    \\
315 - And the best part is: Halley won't remember a thing.    \\
316 - (laughs)    \\
317 - Babies are cute, but they're dumb.    \\
318 - (chuckles)\\
319 - I mean, I-I go like this, she thinks I'm gone. Then magically I'm back. I mean...    \\
320 - Honestly, why are we saving for college?    \\
321 - I'm not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.    \\
322 - Well, she gets it from me.    \\
323 - Speaking of which, I have some news about your Aunt Trixie.    \\
324 - (sighs)    \\
325 -  Radio blastin' all night     \\
326 -  Truck bed's a carriage...     \\
327 - Does this place look familiar?    \\
328 - It's hard to say.    \\
329 - Hey, Sheldon's back!    \\
330 - ALL: Sheldon!    \\
331 - It's getting clearer.    \\
332 - You gonna buy another round for the house?    \\
333 - Uh, n-no, thank you.    \\
334 - We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert.    \\
335 - Ask him.    \\
336 - Um, yes.    \\
337 - Howdy, partner.    \\
338 - Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?    \\
339 - These here parts?    \\
340 - It's called fitting in.\\
341 - By the way, good luck.    \\
342 - Here you go.\\
343 - Oh.    \\
344 - Thank goodness!    \\
345 - One top secret quantum guidance system.    \\
346 - You understood the math?    \\
347 - No, but Sheldon told me all about it.    \\
348 - He told everybody.    \\
349 - That's just great.    \\
350 - Oh, don't worry, he made us pinky swear we'd keep it a secret.    \\
351 - I swear...    \\
352 - ALL: I swear...    \\
353 - ...not to tell anyone...    \\
354 - ALL:\\
355 - ...not to tell anyone...    \\
356 - (whispering): ...the top secret military information I'm about to tell you.    \\
357 - ALL (whispering): The top secret military information I'm about to tell you.    \\
358 - We really need to skedaddle.    \\
359 - Thank you.\\
360 - Bye.    \\
361 - KOOTHRAPPALI: See you.    \\
362 - Should probably erase this.    \\
363 - Thank you for making me tea.    \\
364 - You're welcome.\\
365 - How is it?    \\
366 - Yummy. And warm on my back.    \\
367 - Do you need anything else?    \\
368 - You know exactly what I need.    \\
369 - Fine.    \\
370 -  Soft kitty, warm kitty     \\
371 -  Little ball of fur     \\
372 -  Happy kitty, sleepy kitty     \\
373 -  Purr, purr, purr.     \\
374 - That's nice.    \\
375 - Now in German.    \\
376 - (singing in German)    \\
377 - Great.    \\
378 - Now Mandarin.    \\
379 - (singing in Mandarin)    \\
380 - Now Navajo.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Separation Agitation}
1 - All right, we're about to go live.  \\
2 - Everyone on their A-game!  \\
3 - Good energy!  \\
4 - Hello.  \\
5 - I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.  \\
6 - And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.  \\
7 - And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we're calling...   \\
8 - BOTH: “Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.”   \\
9 - (upbeat music playing)   \\
10 -  Wondering how it all began?   \\
11 -  You'll need a good attention span    \\
12 -  For information and entertainment    \\
13 -  That's equally effective    \\
14 -  It's fun with flags    \\
15 -  Behind the flags    \\
16 -  A retrospective    \\
17 -  Flags.    \\
18 - Mind you, when we say “behind the flags”" we don't literally mean these flags.   \\
19 - That's just where we have dinner.   \\
20 - Now, I'm sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began.   \\
21 - So let's hear from some people who were there at the very start.   \\
22 - H-Howard.\\
23 - Flashback sounds.   \\
24 - (piano playing arpeggios)   \\
25 - Could have played that on my harp.   \\
26 - Just roll the clip.   \\
27 - SHELDON: So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.   \\
28 - I honestly don't remember.   \\
29 - SHELDON: Sure you do.   \\
30 - I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag.   \\
31 - It was at the Summer Olympics of     , and two plucky nations...   \\
32 - Oh, wait. I remember.   \\
33 - Oh, and do you remember what you said?   \\
34 - Yes. “Please find someone who cares”"   \\
35 - And that's exactly what I did.   \\
36 - I found a lot of someones.   \\
37 - Almost    .   \\
38 - Many of them on purpose.   \\
39 - And now we're going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favorite Fun with Flags moments.   \\
40 - And-and don't get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed.   \\
41 - Just keep trying.   \\
42 - (computer chimes)   \\
43 - Oh, thank God!   \\
44 - Welcome to Fun with Flags! \\
45 - BERT: Hey, Sheldon.   \\
46 - Hey, Amy. It's Bert.   \\
47 - Hello, Bert.   \\
48 - What is your flag-related comment or query?   \\
49 - I have a girlfriend.   \\
50 - And what does that have to do with flags?   \\
51 - Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.   \\
52 - Bert, you're tying up the line.   \\
53 - My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.   \\
54 - Ooh, ooh. All right.   \\
55 - W-We have our next caller.   \\
56 - BERT: Her name's Rebecca.   \\
57 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
58 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
59 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
60 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
61 -  We built the Wall \\
62 -  We built the pyramids    \\
63 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
64 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
65 -  Bang!    \\
66 - Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo?   \\
67 - (imitating Bernadette): “Oh, Howie, I don't need food as long as I can look at my phone”.   \\
68 - I don't like when you imitate me.   \\
69 - You want to hear my Stuart?   \\
70 - (imitating Stuart): “It's been a while since I've gone on a date.   \\
71 - You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?”   \\
72 - I said that to you in confidence.   \\
73 - This is supposed to be our family fun day.   \\
74 - What's so important on your phone?   \\
75 - I'm on the day care's Web site.   \\
76 - Stop looking at that.\\
77 - The day care's great.   \\
78 - It's on campus.   \\
79 - My office is two minutes away.   \\
80 - There's nothing to worry about.   \\
81 - What if she likes the people who work there more than us?   \\
82 - She already likes soap bubbles more than us.   \\
83 - When I go back to work, we're gonna leave her with these people.   \\
84 - We don't know anything about them.   \\
85 - They're highly-trained educators with background checks.    \\
86 - They're even required to be current on all vaccinations.    \\
87 - You leave her with me, and I'm not any of those things.    \\
88 - Where's Howard?    \\
89 - He took the day off.    \\
90 - Oh, let's take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get.    \\
91 - I'll go first.    \\
92 - Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer.    \\
93 - And the policeman says, “Did you know you were going    miles per hour?”    \\
94 - And Heisenberg says, “Darn it, now I don't know where I am.”    \\
95 - So Howard back Monday?\\
96 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah.    \\
97 - Hey, guys.    \\
98 - Oh, hello.\\
99 - Hey. Want to join us?    \\
100 - (stammers) But he's a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.    \\
101 - Oh, quick! Sit!    \\
102 - So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.    \\
103 - Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show.    \\
104 - People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.    \\
105 - Sorry. I couldn't help myself.    \\
106 - I guess I just love love.    \\
107 - Well, I'm very happy for you.    \\
108 - Hey, we're all having dinner tonight.    \\
109 - Why don't the two of you join us?    \\
110 - Yeah, wh-- Hold on.    \\
111 - We don't know anything about this woman.    \\
112 - What do you want to know?    \\
113 - Is she a geologist?    \\
114 - No.\\
115 - Oh, great. See you at  :  .    \\
116 - (birds chirping)    \\
117 - How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?    \\
118 - Not a good idea.    \\
119 - My hair is a coveted nesting material.    \\
120 - Learning anything?    \\
121 - Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies for almost a year.    \\
122 - I'm going back to work after only four months, so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.    \\
123 - Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.    \\
124 - It's not just the sloth.    \\
125 - Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months.    \\
126 - The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night.    \\
127 - And what do I do? I choose my career over my child!    \\
128 - Told you we should have gone to Legoland.    \\
129 - Can't believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don't.    \\
130 - I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.    \\
131 - Oh, grow up.    \\
132 - (knocking on door)    \\
133 - Don't you have any friends he can date?    \\
134 - Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette.    \\
135 - It's your turn to ruin some poor girl's life.    \\
136 - Oh, hey, guys. Come in.    \\
137 - Thanks.    \\
138 - Everyone, this is Rebecca.\\
139 - Hi.    \\
140 - AMY/LEONARD/PENNY:\\
141 - Hey.    \\
142 - She's younger and far more attractive than he is.    \\
143 - They're copying you two.    \\
144 - What are you making?    \\
145 - Chicken.    \\
146 - Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.    \\
147 - Finally get Halley down?    \\
148 - Yeah, eventually.    \\
149 - She's still not happy about taking a bottle, though.    \\
150 - Look, if you're not ready to go back to work, we'll figure something out.    \\
151 - No, I'll be fine.    \\
152 - It might be good for her.    \\
153 - Howard's mother was around him all the time, and he's a world-class mama's boy.    \\
154 - (scoffs)    \\
155 - I mean, wh-why would you say that?    \\
156 - Go ahead, have a tantrum; that'll prove me wrong.    \\
157 - It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.    \\
158 - I guess.    \\
159 - It wasn't until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.    \\
160 - On that charming note, dinner is served.    \\
161 - So is this your first time dating a scientist?    \\
162 - 'Cause I'm thinking of starting a support group.    \\
163 - Actually, I'm not new to this.    \\
164 - I was engaged to a Scientologist.    \\
165 - (clears throat)\\
166 - Bert, Rebecca.    \\
167 - I'd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.    \\
168 - Don't worry about it.\\
169 - It's fine.    \\
170 - See? It was fine.    \\
171 - I didn't need a time-out.    \\
172 - It wasn't a time-out.\\
173 - Let's get some food.    \\
174 - You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.    \\
175 - Get your food!    \\
176 - So how did you two meet?    \\
177 - Oh, it's such a cute story.    \\
178 - We met on a dating Web site.    \\
179 - Is that it?    \\
180 - Oh, sorry. The end.    \\
181 - That's nice.    \\
182 - I haven't had much success meeting people online.    \\
183 - I didn't either, until I revamped my profile.    \\
184 - What'd you do, delete your photo?    \\
185 - Go.\\
186 - Fine.    \\
187 - And don't you slam that door.    \\
188 - Aw, man.    \\
189 - Did I say something wrong?    \\
190 - No, it's always him.    \\
191 - So, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?    \\
192 - Right. I wasn't getting any responses, and then I added, “Recent $   ,    MacArthur grant winner”, and five minutes later,    \\
193 - I met my soul mate.    \\
194 - I was wrong.\\
195 - You can come back in.    \\
196 - So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?    \\
197 - I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn't really work out.    \\
198 - I'd say she's copying you again, but...    \\
199 - ...I'm getting tired of sitting in the hall.    \\
200 - I'd love a personal trainer.    \\
201 - I haven't seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.    \\
202 - I could give you some free sessions.    \\
203 - Oh, is that offer for everybody?    \\
204 - (chuckles) Nice try.    \\
205 - I'm not going.    \\
206 - Where's your bathroom?    \\
207 - Mm, just down there.    \\
208 - She's so perfect, sometimes I think she isn't real.    \\
209 - And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.    \\
210 - Aw, that's so weird.    \\
211 - AMY: I'm sorry, Bert, but aren't you worried she's only with you for your money?    \\
212 - She better be. On our first date, I bought her an   -inch flat-screen.    \\
213 - Your first date?    \\
214 - Did you even measure her walls?    \\
215 - You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.    \\
216 - And we lived happily ever after.    \\
217 - The end.    \\
218 - Well, guess I'm ready to go.    \\
219 - Have a great first day back.    \\
220 - You have everything she needs for day care?    \\
221 - Yep, all in the bag.    \\
222 - Good.    \\
223 - Okay, sweetie, Mommy's gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.    \\
224 - I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.    \\
225 - Bye, cutie.    \\
226 - I'm gonna miss you.    \\
227 - (voice breaking): I'm gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.    \\
228 - Stop, you're gonna make me cry.    \\
229 - (voice breaking): Great, now everybody's crying.    \\
230 - (clears throat)    \\
231 - At least Halley's not.    \\
232 - That's good. (chuckles)    \\
233 - She's not gonna see us all day, and she doesn't even care!    \\
234 - Who's ready to laugh?\\
235 - (groans)    \\
236 - Okay. So...    \\
237 - Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar.    \\
238 - Feynman says, “It appears we're inside a joke.”    \\
239 - Einstein replies, “But only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously.”    \\
240 - To which Schrodinger says, “If someone's looking in the window, I'm leaving.”    \\
241 - (chuckles) That's actually funny.    \\
242 - You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.    \\
243 - Hey.    \\
244 - Oh, hello. Join us.\\
245 - Hey. Yeah.    \\
246 - Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.    \\
247 - Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn't flaunt my money to find love.    \\
248 - I might break up with Rebecca.    \\
249 - Wow, that's a big step.    \\
250 - I think it shows a lot of character.    \\
251 - I'm gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.    \\
252 - (laughs):\\
253 - That's a good one.    \\
254 - Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.    \\
255 - BERNADETTE: How's she doing?    \\
256 - She's great. Look.    \\
257 - I see a wall...    \\
258 - floor...    \\
259 - some Asian baby...    \\
260 - There she is.    \\
261 - See? Nothing to worry about.    \\
262 - Thank you.    \\
263 - Okay, I'm gonna try and get some work done.    \\
264 - Yeah, me, too. Love you.    \\
265 - Love you, too. Bye.    \\
266 - (phone beeps)    \\
267 - (sighs)    \\
268 - STUART: How is she?\\
269 - (screams)    \\
270 - What are you doing here?    \\
271 - Can't a guy hang out at a college he doesn't go to and stare at a baby that isn't his?    \\
272 - I get it.    \\
273 - I haven't even made it to my office yet.    \\
274 - (both chuckle)    \\
275 - (both sigh)    \\
276 - Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?    \\
277 - Probably.    \\
278 - We should go.    \\
279 - Yeah.    \\
280 - (exhales)    \\
281 - Or we could take her to the aquarium.    \\
282 - I'll get her, you grab her bag.    \\
283 - Hang on, Halley, we're busting you out of there!    \\
284 - What are you looking at?    \\
285 - Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective.    \\
286 - Get this, people are calling it “the longest one yet”"    \\
287 - (knocking on door)    \\
288 - BERT: Hello? Anybody home?    \\
289 - Is that Bert?    \\
290 - BERT: It's Bert.    \\
291 - I think it's Bert.    \\
292 - Hey, what's up?    \\
293 - I broke up with Rebecca.    \\
294 - Oh.\\
295 - AMY: Oh.    \\
296 - You know, good for you.    \\
297 - No, I miss her.    \\
298 - I don't know why I listened to you.    \\
299 - He's not wrong.    \\
300 - It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.    \\
301 - You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak.    \\
302 - Yes, starting now.    \\
303 - Bert, you're a good guy; you deserve a woman who's interested in more than just your money.    \\
304 - She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear.    \\
305 - Now the only one doing that is me.    \\
306 - If you're that upset, go get her back.    \\
307 - I tried.    \\
308 - She's not answering my calls.    \\
309 - Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.    \\
310 - I made a huge mistake.    \\
311 - No, you didn't.    \\
312 - Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money,    \\
313 - I dated lots of girls who weren't right for me.    \\
314 - And then I gave up my money, and now I'm alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.    \\
315 - Look, sweetie, relationships aren't about money, okay?    \\
316 - It's about respect and having things in common and...    \\
317 - Yes, Sheldon?    \\
318 - You and Leonard don't have anything in common.    \\
319 - Maybe you should break up.    \\
320 - You called on him.    \\
321 - (singsongy):\\
322 - Guess who's home from day care?    \\
323 - It's Halley.    \\
324 - Unless somebody else put an “X” on the bottom of their kid's foot.    \\
325 - You realize they called when you took her.    \\
326 - (singsongy): Guess who's home from the aquarium?    \\
327 - BERT: Sorry again for barging in.    \\
328 - You don't have to go.\\
329 - You're welcome to hang with us.    \\
330 - Actually, our friendship group is at capacity.    \\
331 - But if anybody drops out, you're at the top of the list.    \\
332 - Unless it's Raj, in which case, we'll probably get a person of color.    \\
333 - You guys are nice, but I'm just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.    \\
334 - I feel bad for Bert.    \\
335 - So he's using his money to attract a mate.    \\
336 - Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy?    \\
337 - Or Leonard using his power of groveling to get Penny?    \\
338 - It's totally different.    \\
339 - Bert's money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.    \\
340 - All that and he's shorter than me.    \\
341 - Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?    \\
342 - Oh, so many things.    \\
343 - Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.    \\
344 - Really?    \\
345 - Relax.\\
346 - We're the same blood type.    \\
347 - He knew he could harvest an organ.    \\
348 - She does look happy.    \\
349 - See? This is the right thing for her.    \\
350 - Let's all just go to work.    \\
351 - (sighs)    \\
352 - Anytime.    \\
353 - Let me just say good-bye.    \\
354 - Halley. Look at Mommy.    \\
355 - Over here, honey.    \\
356 - Say good-bye to Mommy!    \\
357 - Look at me!    \\
358 - Look at your mother!    \\
359 - (babies crying)    \\
360 - All right, we can go.    \\
361 - Hello.    \\
362 - I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.    \\
363 - And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.    \\
364 - Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together.    \\
365 - So welcome to tonight's episode...    \\
366 - BOTH: Fun with Flags: \\
367 - Behind the\\
368 - Behind the Flags:A Retrospective Retrospective. \\
369 - Ooh, we already have our first call.    \\
370 - Oh.    \\
371 - Hello, you're on Fun with Flags. \\
372 - BERT: The Jet Ski worked. I got her back.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Cognition Regeneration}
1 - We're pinned down!  \\
2 - We can't get through!  \\
3 - Sheldon, get over here and help!  \\
4 - Okay, one second.  \\
5 - Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?  \\
6 - I'm trying to shoot.  \\
7 - Then use the shoot button, not the "wonderful thing about Tiggers" button!  \\
8 - Aw.   \\
9 - That's it, we're dead.   \\
10 - Okay, challenge them again.   \\
11 - Doing it right now.   \\
12 - Oh, they can't.   \\
13 - There's an important Little League game tomorrow.   \\
14 - No wonder they beat us, they're jocks.   \\
15 - What happened to me?   \\
16 - I used to excel at these things.   \\
17 - Kids are always better at video games.   \\
18 - Well, I don't like it.   \\
19 - Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.   \\
20 - No, but it's not just video games.   \\
21 - I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.   \\
22 - Oh, so our love is not real?   \\
23 - Well, I-I know how you feel.   \\
24 - I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.   \\
25 - I guess I just need to face it,   \\
26 - I'm no longer a wunderkind.   \\
27 - Now I just wonder what's for lunch.   \\
28 - Hot dogs.   \\
29 - Yay.   \\
30 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
31 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
32 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
33 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
34 -  We built the Wall \\
35 -  We built the pyramids    \\
36 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
37 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
38 -  Bang!    \\
39 - I didn't know you could drink while you're breastfeeding.   \\
40 - Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.   \\
41 - I'm pretty sure that's a myth, let me check.   \\
42 - Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass over your head.   \\
43 - To denial.   \\
44 - (whoops)   \\
45 - Oh, I'm gonna get another.   \\
46 - You want food?   \\
47 - Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, ,    calories a day.   \\
48 - Do not touch that phone.   \\
49 - Penny?   \\
50 - Oh, Zack. Hey.   \\
51 - What are the odds of running into you here?   \\
52 - Well, it's a bar, so pretty good.   \\
53 - Uh, what's new?   \\
54 - Oh, tons of stuff.   \\
55 - Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.   \\
56 - Well, congratulations.   \\
57 - That's what my dermatologist said.   \\
58 - No, on-on getting engaged, good for you.   \\
59 - Oh, thanks. How about you?   \\
60 - Hey, how's Leonard?   \\
61 - Is he still smart?   \\
62 - Yes, yes, he's working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope.   \\
63 - Of course, the first time I say it right, he's not even here.\\
64 - (chuckles)   \\
65 - I love that little guy.   \\
66 - Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.   \\
67 - Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.   \\
68 - Cool, I'll check with Sara.   \\
69 - Sara, pull up my calendar.   \\
70 - It never works for me.   \\
71 - I've been thinking about our recent humiliation.   \\
72 - You're gonna have to be more specific.   \\
73 - At the hands of those teenagers.   \\
74 - More.   \\
75 - Boy teenagers.   \\
76 - Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.   \\
77 - I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called "super-aging."   \\
78 - You know who's a super-ager?\\
79 - Jennifer Lopez.   \\
80 - Like, what is her secret?   \\
81 - Now, this is rare.   \\
82 - I don't know which one of you I want to stop talking first.   \\
83 - The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.   \\
84 - Like JLo's hair.   \\
85 - Boy, it is neck and neck right now.   \\
86 - How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?   \\
87 - Well, it's not just doing simple cognitive tasks.   \\
88 - You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.    \\
89 - I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.    \\
90 - If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.    \\
91 - Jab mein aat saal katha Maine seekha tha. \\
92 - Could you say that in English?    \\
93 - I actually, I never learned Hindi.    \\
94 - Hey, you ready to go?    \\
95 - Yeah, I guess.    \\
96 - What's the matter?    \\
97 - Honestly? It's a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it's not like we have a lot to talk about.    \\
98 - What? He loves you, okay?    \\
99 - And he's interested in your work.    \\
100 - You could talk about the infinite perspective...    \\
101 - I swear I know it.    \\
102 - It'll be fine, let's just go.    \\
103 - Well, and his fiancée will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.    \\
104 - (groans)    \\
105 - Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool  . \\
106 - Ha! I knew you weren't asleep.    \\
107 - Hey, guys.    \\
108 - Hi.\\
109 - Hi. Hey, where's your fiancée?    \\
110 - Oh, she couldn't make it.\\
111 - She had an emergency.    \\
112 - Oh, no, what happened?    \\
113 - I didn't ask.    \\
114 - Hey.    \\
115 - - Hey.\\
116 - - Hey.    \\
117 - What smells so good?    \\
118 - Raj is teaching meto make croissants.    \\
119 - Is this part of your super-aging?    \\
120 - Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it's like the chemistry set I had as a kid.    \\
121 - Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.    \\
122 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Okay.    \\
123 - Shall we?    \\
124 - Oh, my God.    \\
125 - It's light, it's flaky, it's buttery.    \\
126 - You don't need to have s*x with him, just eat one of these.    \\
127 - Yes, it is delicious.    \\
128 - Wha... Physicist, baker, lover, what can't I do?    \\
129 - Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough.    \\
130 - Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.    \\
131 - For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.    \\
132 - You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.    \\
133 - You're just using food to mask the fear that you're fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.    \\
134 - Damn it, he's good at that, too.    \\
135 - Thanks.    \\
136 - Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool.\\
137 - Aw.    \\
138 - Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?    \\
139 - I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.    \\
140 - I miss that guy.    \\
141 - He's like\\
142 - the Swedish Chef Muppet.    \\
143 - I don't know what he's saying, but he's funny.    \\
144 - Oh, I know what he's saying, and he's not, he's not funny.    \\
145 - So, Penny, what's going on with you?    \\
146 - How's the job?    \\
147 - Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.    \\
148 - She's doing amazing.    \\
149 - She can actually make a side effect, like   % chance of liver failure, sound like a   % chance of liver success.    \\
150 - Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job.    \\
151 - Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.    \\
152 - Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking for a new head of sales at my company.    \\
153 - And we don't sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you'll be telling is we print on recycled paper.    \\
154 - We don't.    \\
155 - Oh, that's a nice offer.    \\
156 - You know, we'd make a great team.    \\
157 - Or as we say in the menu business,  I can't do this without "Me N U."    \\
158 - Right, 'cause it spells "menu."    \\
159 - Yeah, right? It's funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that's my favorite.    \\
160 - All right, this is everything.    \\
161 - What do you want to learn?    \\
162 - It really doesn't matter, as long as it's challenging.    \\
163 - Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up... magic.    \\
164 - Howard, I'm trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.    \\
165 - So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?    \\
166 - Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding.    \\
167 - Have you ever tried to juggle?    \\
168 - Yes, I'm juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.    \\
169 - And it's hard, isn't it?    \\
170 - So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one.    \\
171 - Hmm?\\
172 - Okay, I think I got that.    \\
173 - Uh, h-hold on.\\
174 - (chuckles)    \\
175 - There's a, an old saying in juggling.    \\
176 - Is it "I'm going to die alone"?    \\
177 - No, it's "if you want to have fun, start with one."    \\
178 - Yours we think, but we do not say.    \\
179 - All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.    \\
180 - Okay.    \\
181 - (laughs softly)    \\
182 - Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler's elbow?    \\
183 - No.    \\
184 - Are you sure? 'Cause I'm feeling a twinge.    \\
185 - See, that wasn't so bad.    \\
186 - He even picked up the check.    \\
187 - Yeah.    \\
188 - Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip,    \\
189 - I'm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears.    \\
190 - (laughs)    \\
191 - You're not really considering working for him, are you?    \\
192 - Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect.    \\
193 - I have sales experience, and I've been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he's figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.    \\
194 - Don't you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?    \\
195 - You work with Sheldon, you tell me.    \\
196 - Yeah, it's weird.    \\
197 - Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?    \\
198 - No, no, I-I'm not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now,  and you make great money and you haven't slept with any of your coworkers.    \\
199 - Great, so you want me to stay at a job I'm not happy at?    \\
200 - (scoffs)\\
201 - Uh...    \\
202 - You okay?    \\
203 - You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.    \\
204 - Of course I don't want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn't very smart.    \\
205 - You don't have to stop, just slow down, I'll jump out.    \\
206 - Amy, look,\\
207 - I'm on a unicycle!    \\
208 - How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?    \\
209 - I hurt myself juggling.    \\
210 - Where did you get it?    \\
211 - Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.    \\
212 - Have you tried letting go of the rope?    \\
213 - What, are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle.    \\
214 - All right, well, have fun.    \\
215 - Wait, I need help getting down.    \\
216 - Well, what do you want me to do?    \\
217 - Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here.    \\
218 - But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.    \\
219 - So you told her she was being dumb?    \\
220 - No, I told her she was being not smart.    \\
221 - Which was dumb.    \\
222 - Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?    \\
223 - We covered this, I'm dumb.    \\
224 - So he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares?    \\
225 - I can't believe Leonard would be so insecure.    \\
226 - Really?    \\
227 - I have no trouble believing that at all.    \\
228 - And Zack's engaged.    \\
229 - Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.    \\
230 - We're talking about the same Leonard, right?    \\
231 - So you think it's fine if she works for Zack?    \\
232 - I don't know, maybe.    \\
233 - Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.    \\
234 - Yes, but that's gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.    \\
235 - Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.    \\
236 - Again...\\
237 - (chuckles)    \\
238 - I would never let Howard work with an ex.    \\
239 - What, you wouldn't trust him?    \\
240 - I wouldn't trust her.    \\
241 - He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.    \\
242 - Yeah, that-that is the sexiest dog.    \\
243 - And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job    \\
244 - I was uncomfortable with.    \\
245 - 'Cause he's scared of you?\\
246 - Terrified.    \\
247 - Yeah.    \\
248 - You know what? I'm with Leonard, this isn't cool.    \\
249 - Thank you.    \\
250 - I disagree.    \\
251 - Penny is a strong, independent woman.    \\
252 - The more you try to control her, the more she'll push back.    \\
253 - So you think it's okay?    \\
254 - Oh, no, she's gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.    \\
255 - What are you doing?    \\
256 - I'm returning this stuff to Howard.    \\
257 - Oh.    \\
258 - Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn't want it, we'd give it to a homeless clown.    \\
259 - What happened to learning the unicycle?    \\
260 - Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb.    \\
261 - Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.    \\
262 - You said juggling was dumb, too.    \\
263 - Well, it is.    \\
264 - If I wanted to hold three things at once, I'd wear cargo pants.    \\
265 - Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?    \\
266 - Are you calling me a quitter?    \\
267 - Well, if you honestly...    \\
268 - This conversation is over.    \\
269 - His mother warned me.    \\
270 - Everybody warned me.    \\
271 - Actually, he warned me.    \\
272 - Hey.\\
273 - Hi.    \\
274 - You want to talk?    \\
275 - That doesn't seem to be where I shine.    \\
276 - How about I just give you one of these?    \\
277 - Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won't get mad.    \\
278 - I don't like it after s*x, and I don't like it now.    \\
279 - Yeah, sorry.\\
280 - Yeah.    \\
281 - All right, just come here.    \\
282 - Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don't want you to be uncomfortable.    \\
283 - Well, thanks.    \\
284 - And I don't want you to be stuck at a job you don't like.    \\
285 - Then what do we do?    \\
286 - Well, I don't love it, but if you really want to take this job, I'll find a way to deal with it.    \\
287 - No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and...    \\
288 - I'm just gonna stay where I'm at for now.    \\
289 - No, no, no, no, you're-you're unhappy there and then you're gonna blame me for making you stay, and it's fine, I'll just-- I'll suck it up.    \\
290 - You don't need to do that, it's okay.    \\
291 - Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I'm being selfish and holding you back.    \\
292 - What? Say something.    \\
293 - Yeah, that is pretty annoying.    \\
294 - I made you tea.    \\
295 - Thank you.    \\
296 - I'm sorry I called you a quitter.    \\
297 - It's okay, I stopped being upset about that.    \\
298 - And no, the irony is not lost on me.    \\
299 - What are you reading?    \\
300 - This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is   .    \\
301 - So?    \\
302 - So I'm running out of time.    \\
303 - That's ridiculous, you're a brilliant man.    \\
304 - The best years of your life are still ahead of you.    \\
305 - Oh, you have to say that, you're sweet on me.    \\
306 - Well, if you're really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.    \\
307 - Hey!    \\
308 - I thought you were sweet on me.    \\
309 - Okay, fine, let's say you never win a Nobel Prize.    \\
310 - Let's say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you've accomplished but for who you are as a man.    \\
311 - Wouldn't that be a life well-lived?    \\
312 - You're so cute.    \\
313 - I'm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.    \\
314 - So many warnings.    \\
315 - Okay, are you sure about this?    \\
316 - Absolutely. I just want you to be happy.    \\
317 - And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I'm being.    \\
318 - Penny, what's up?    \\
319 - Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it and I want to take the job.    \\
320 - Oh, bad news.    \\
321 - When my fiancée found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.    \\
322 - Oh, so there's no job?    \\
323 - Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.    \\
324 - Okay, thanks anyway.    \\
325 - By    \\
326 - Well, his fiancée thought the idea of us working together was stupid.    \\
327 - You were right, I was wrong.    \\
328 - Aren't you gonna say anything?    \\
329 - Not if I want to be doing this later.    \\
330 - Hey, I didn't know you were home.    \\
331 - Where you been?    \\
332 - I went to see your mom.    \\
333 - Seriously, where were you?    \\
334 - I just told you, your mom's.    \\
335 - Why?    \\
336 - Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.    \\
337 - Oh.    \\
338 - What'd she say?    \\
339 - She didn't say much of anything.    \\
340 - But she said a lot!    \\
341 - (puppet voice):\\
342 - Hi, Bernadette, remember me?    \\
343 - First of all, that's not what she sounds like, she's from South Carolina.    \\
344 - (chuckles) I can't believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.    \\
345 - Okay, it's not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist.    \\
346 - I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumors that the other contestants were pregnant.    \\
347 - Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.    \\
348 - No!    \\
349 - And the little lady has a name.    \\
350 - Which is?    \\
351 - Tammy Jo St. Cloud.    \\
352 - "Tammy Jo St. Cloud."    \\
353 - Oh, and I'm a dork for juggling.    \\
354 - Sorry, you're not a dork.    \\
355 - (Southern accent):\\
356 - You're a clown.    \\
357 - (normal voice):\\
358 - Tammy Jo, don't say that, you'll make him feel bad.    \\
359 - (Southern accent): Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?    \\
360 - All right, very funny.    \\
361 - Don't listen to her, she's been in a box for, like,    years.    \\
362 - (chuckles)    \\
363 - Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.\\
364 - (giggles)    \\
365 - That's enough, put her away.    \\
366 - (Southern accent):\\
367 - Oh, big daddy,    \\
368 - I don't think so.    \\
369 - You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me.    \\
370 - We all family now.    \\
371 - All right, you're freaking me out.    \\
372 - (Southern accent):\\
373 - Don't be that way.    \\
374 - If you don't mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois.    \\
375 - Ooh!    \\
376 - I'm doing it.    \\
377 - I'm doing it.\\
378 - (chuckles)    \\
379 - I'm tall and I'm doing it!    \\
380 - (snorts softly)    \\
381 - Ah, man.
\subsection {Episode 23: The Gyroscopic Collapse}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - What's this?\\
3 - Oh, nothing,   just some math we don't need.\\
4 - This is a different approach.\\
5 - You trying to get the guidance system even smaller?\\
6 - It's just a... theory.\\
7 - Well, it's not even worked out.\\
8 - Oh.\\
9 - (chuckles)\\
10 - I want this.\\
11 - Uh, but we've already met the agreed upon specs.\\
12 - Going smaller would require    weeks' worth of new computations.\\
13 - So get the kid with the two shirts to do it.\\
14 - Sir, I mean, (stammers) if I may,    uh, we've put a lot of thought and effort    into this current prototype.\\
15 - It's a really elegant solution,    and most importantly, it works.\\
16 - You both make excellent points.\\
17 - And thank you for presenting it so articulately.\\
18 - (chuckles)\\
19 - Make this.\\
20 - Champagne,    champagne, Thank you.\\
21 - and for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.\\
22 - No bendy straw, some party.\\
23 - Hey, a-a toast.\\
24 - Thank you all for your support    while we worked on our Air Force project.\\
25 - And please know that    we could not have done it without you,    so cheers.\\
26 - ALL: Cheers.\\
27 - (whoops)\\
28 - You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us,    but this is your accomplishment.\\
29 - Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.\\
30 - Without me.\\
31 - To success without Raj.\\
32 - (all cheer)\\
33 - So what happens next?\\
34 - Phase two,    we test it, perfect it,    and hope to live long enough to see the movie    based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us.\\
35 - (all chuckle)\\
36 - Yeah, I'll definitely live long enough--    vitamin C.\\
37 - First thing tomorrow morning, we're back at it.\\
38 - Without me.\\
39 - I hope his character doesn't make it into the movie;    he's kind of a bummer.\\
40 - FEMALE VOICE: Leonard Hofstadter.\\
41 - Access granted.\\
42 - Hmm.\\
43 - I don't care if this thing's burning out my retinas;    it makes me feel special.\\
44 - Now, before we field test, I think we...\\
45 - What the hell?\\
46 - Where is everything?\\
47 - Who else has access to this room?\\
48 - It's a secure lab in a classified facility;    only the U.S. government and us.\\
49 - This is very disconcerting.\\
50 - But the movie did just get good.\\
51 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
52 - Wait!\\
53 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Sir, I-I-I'm sorry but I just don't get it.\\
54 - Y-You came into our lab    in the middle of the night and took our prototype    and all of our research and didn't even tell us?\\
55 - Sounds like you get it.\\
56 - Well, why would you do that?\\
57 - You guys completed phase one, we'll take it from here.\\
58 - Where did you move it?\\
59 - I can't tell you that.\\
60 - Are you implementing phase two?\\
61 - I can't tell you that.\\
62 - Wait, so you're just going to take all the work    we've done for the last year and toss us aside?\\
63 - That one I can tell you, yes.\\
64 - This is all very upsetting.\\
65 - I'm sorry to hear that.\\
66 - As you know,    the primary focus of the United States military    is people's feelings.\\
67 - If that's sarcasm, please save it for our enemies.\\
68 - Well, I may be moving out soon.\\
69 - I think I found a place to live.\\
70 - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\\
71 - Really?\\
72 - You kept sending me apartment listings.\\
73 - Um...\\
74 - well, I...\\
75 - yeah, you got me.\\
76 -  Where are you moving?\\
77 -  And when?\\
78 - But a-also where?\\
79 -  Bert has a room for rent.\\
80 -  So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?\\
81 -  Uh, no, it's, uh, pretty private, actually,     it's over his garage.\\
82 -  So the only time I'll see him is when he pulls his car in,     does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room.\\
83 -  Well, good for you.\\
84 - Mm-hmm.\\
85 -  I actually have a little news myself.\\
86 -  Okay, we're just gonna circle back to when he's moving out?\\
87 -  Okay, that's cool.\\
88 -  I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher     at Princeton.\\
89 -  - Hey, that's amazing.\\
90 - - Good for you.\\
91 - - Congratulations.\\
92 -  Thanks, but the thing is I'll be gone for a few months     and I don't know how Sheldon's gonna feel about that.\\
93 -  Oh, come on, he's a grown man, he can take care of himself.\\
94 -  You really believe that?\\
95 -  Once again, you got me.\\
96 -  How can you work on something for a year     and they just take it?\\
97 -  I can't believe the Air Force would treat us like that.\\
98 -  You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes.\\
99 -  It's too bad I enjoy doing them so much.\\
100 -  The Air Force did it again.\\
101 -  They're erasing our lives!\\
102 -  Third floor, wrong apartment.\\
103 -  Although, if anyone's gonna clean out your apartment     and disappear, it'd be Penny.\\
104 -  She might disappear,     but she's definitely not cleaning anything.\\
105 -  It's okay, everything's here.\\
106 -  Oh, hey, what's going on?\\
107 -  You won't believe it;     the military confiscated our project.\\
108 -  What?\\
109 - You're kidding.\\
110 -  Why would they do that?\\
111 -  They wouldn't say.\\
112 -  I feel so betrayed.\\
113 -  You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle     who brought you presents.\\
114 -  Turns out he's the other kind.\\
115 -  Sheldon, I'm so sorry.\\
116 -  Thank you.\\
117 - Can we just talk about something else?\\
118 -  Yeah, what's going on with you guys?\\
119 -  Give us some good news.\\
120 -  Amy's got some news.\\
121 -  Yeah, um...\\
122 -  Raj is moving out.\\
123 -  Oh, no.\\
124 -  (sternly): When?\\
125 -  You doing okay?\\
126 -  Not really.\\
127 - (chuckles)\\
128 -  Want me to put on some Neil Diamond?\\
129 -  That always makes you feel better.\\
130 -  No.\\
131 -  Then you'll get all sexed up and I'm not in the mood.\\
132 -  I mean, an entire year wasted.\\
133 -  You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.\\
134 -  Oh.\\
135 - Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world.\\
136 -  Really?\\
137 -  That's the importance you put on us having a baby?\\
138 -  I'm happy about it, but, I mean, it's not like I did much.\\
139 -  I mean, after the first three minutes     it was pretty much all you.\\
140 -  So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?\\
141 -  No, I'm waiting till he's in a good mood.\\
142 -  Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.\\
143 -  I don't know, maybe I shouldn't go.\\
144 -  Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.\\
145 -  I guess.\\
146 - And he'll have you and Leonard right across the hall     the whole time.\\
147 -  Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go...\\
148 -  Got to go.\\
149 -  Morning.\\
150 -  I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.\\
151 -  Are you feeling okay?\\
152 -  Not really.\\
153 -  Apparently grief can make one less regular.\\
154 -  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\\
155 -  No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail.\\
156 -  Oh, the-the more details, the more sorry.\\
157 -  Well, maybe this'll cheer you up.\\
158 -  I made your favorite oatmeal...\\
159 -  plain.\\
160 -  What's the occasion?\\
161 -  No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you.\\
162 -  You're so kind.\\
163 -  You know, I don't know how I ever got by without you.\\
164 -  Oh.\\
165 -  That's sweet, but you... you did just fine on your own.\\
166 -  Well, I thought that, too,     but I've come to realize, I am completely dependent on you.\\
167 -  Sheldon, you're, you're being silly.\\
168 -  No, to wake up every morning and know you're there     is a great comfort to me.\\
169 -  Mmm, tasteless.\\
170 -  How do you do it?\\
171 -  You know, what you need to do is     put this Air Force project behind you     and just dive into something new.\\
172 -  Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment.\\
173 -  You and I could spend more time on that.\\
174 -  Oh, I don't know,     I mean, let's say we succeed in proving     that our consciousness creates reality.\\
175 -  I mean, what will we have really accomplished?\\
176 -  You know, a loaf of bread's still three bucks.\\
177 -  I'm confused.\\
178 -  You're always saying that you want to spend more time with me.\\
179 -  That is true, I have said that.\\
180 -  Well, a lot, it's very annoying.\\
181 -  Has something changed?\\
182 -  Um, is there something that you're not telling me?\\
183 -  I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.\\
184 -  Princeton?\\
185 -  A fine institution.\\
186 -  The place where Albert Einstein taught.\\
187 -  And where Leonard got his PhD,     so it may have gone downhill.\\
188 -  Yeah, that's the one.\\
189 -  Well, that's wonderful.\\
190 -  Congratulations.\\
191 -  Well, I-I haven't accepted it yet.\\
192 -  I wanted to talk to you first.\\
193 -  Wh-What is there to talk about?\\
194 -  You have to take it.\\
195 - It's important.\\
196 -  So are you.\\
197 -  Thank you, but I'll be fine.\\
198 -  Are-are you sure?\\
199 -  Yes.\\
200 - I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend,     but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals     to keep me company.\\
201 -  Although, thanks to your high-fiber breakfast,     I'm sure that'll be leaving me, too.\\
202 -  Really?\\
203 -  He doesn't put raisins or banana slices     or anything in it?\\
204 -  I don't think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.\\
205 -  I mean, I like a little brown sugar...\\
206 -  Guys.\\
207 -  You're still gonna go, right?\\
208 -  I don't know.\\
209 -  Sheldon's so vulnerable right now.\\
210 -  Oh, come on.\\
211 - Look, if the roles were reversed,     he'd be on the first train to New Jersey,     or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one.\\
212 -  Well, distance might be nice.\\
213 -  The last time a big project ended for Howie,     he wouldn't stop following me around.\\
214 -  He even went with me to get a mammogram.\\
215 -  Well, what's wrong with that?\\
216 -  No, he wanted to get one with me,     like some kind of weird couple's massage.\\
217 -  And yet you bore his child.\\
218 - Neato.\\
219 -  You're excited about this opportunity, right?\\
220 -  Of course.\\
221 - I get to be part of the first team     to use radon markers to map the structures that...\\
222 -  Okay, a simple yes will do.\\
223 -  You have to go.\\
224 -  I know, but what if Sheldon...\\
225 -  Okay, listen to me.\\
226 - Your relationship can handle     being long distance for a while.\\
227 -  It's not like you two are very physical.\\
228 -  Hey, you don't know what goes on behind closed doors.\\
229 -  A lot of lectures?\\
230 -  All right, so you know.\\
231 -  I'm telling you, if you don't go     you'll end up regretting it.\\
232 -  WOLOWITZ: Hey!\\
233 -  Wait up!\\
234 - Oh, great.\\
235 -  You left something at home.\\
236 -  A big hug!\\
237 - Oh!\\
238 -  (Wolowitz chuckles)\\
239 -  I found it right next to these kisses.\\
240 -  (Wolowitz smooching)\\
241 -  It's too late for me.\\
242 -  Save yourself.\\
243 -  So, are you excited to have your own place again?\\
244 -  I am, but I'll miss you guys.\\
245 -  Ah, we'll miss you, too.\\
246 -  Wha... you could try saying that without smiling.\\
247 -  I'm trying.\\
248 - This is the best I can do.\\
249 -  (harmonica playing)\\
250 -  What are you doing?\\
251 -  What does it look like?\\
252 -  I'm playing sad harmonica...\\
253 -  in an apartment as empty as my heart.\\
254 -  Why?\\
255 -  I got the blues.\\
256 -  My baby done left me.\\
257 -  Come on, Sheldon.\\
258 -  Amy's only gone for a few months.\\
259 -  And now that I'm moving out, your old room is empty,     so you can stay there whenever you want.\\
260 -  Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?\\
261 -  Yeah, sure.\\
262 -  Sheldon, you're being silly.\\
263 -  Am I?\\
264 -  Yesterday I had an Air Force project,     a girlfriend who lived with me,     and my good friend Raj right across the hall.\\
265 -  Do you really care about that last one?\\
266 -  No, but that list was sounding a little thin.\\
267 -  Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this.\\
268 -  Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity,     which gives you an opportunity     to show her that you're a loving and supportive boyfriend.\\
269 -  So trick her.\\
270 -  All right, let me start again.\\
271 -  Uh... you and Amy...\\
272 -  KOOTHRAPPALI: Can I get my stuff?\\
273 -  Sounds like it's gonna be a while.\\
274 -  I missed you.\\
275 - (gasps)\\
276 -  Come here, let's talk.\\
277 -  Ooh.\\
278 - Sounds serious.\\
279 -  Have I been a bad boy?\\
280 -  Am I gonna get a spanking     'cause you know I...\\
281 - Just listen.\\
282 -  I don't know if you realize this,     but whenever you're between projects,     you tend to get a little insecure.\\
283 -  Oh.\\
284 - A little clingy.\\
285 -  I know and I'm sorry.\\
286 -  Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.\\
287 -  Stop.\\
288 -  I love when you're affectionate,     but this is not coming from a good place.\\
289 -  (laughing): Well, excuse me,     but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug     for two years and the FDA shut down your project?\\
290 -  I signed us up for ballroom dance class.\\
291 -  Okay, and what did you do     when they took you off the antifungal team?\\
292 -  I made us have a baby.\\
293 -  So?\\
294 -  Bring it in.\\
295 -  (both chuckle)\\
296 -  And now the movie just got rated "R."     Hey.\\
297 -  You going somewhere?\\
298 -  No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.\\
299 -  Sheldon, that isn't necessary.\\
300 -  No, it is.\\
301 -  Leonard pointed out to me     that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend,     so here's some quality luggage.\\
302 -  Thank you.\\
303 -  The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...\\
304 -  Perhaps you should fly inside it.\\
305 -  Does this mean you're okay with me going?\\
306 -  Well, I'm not looking forward to it,     but it is a wonderful opportunity     and you need to take it.\\
307 -  Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey,     so it's not like you're gonna want to stay.\\
308 -  Uh, I know it's not your birthday,     but if you're interested...\\
309 -  I am.\\
310 - Okay.\\
311 -  Oh, and just to be clear,     I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.\\
312 -  I wasn't thinking that.\\
313 -  Well, no, it's just, I'm just warning you, you know,     if you find yourself  ,    miles away     and craving a-a hit of this, you know.....\\
314 - I can't Skype it to you.\\
315 -  That's a risk I'm willing to take.\\
316 -  All right, then.\\
317 -  Let's go to the bedroom, remove our clothes,     fold them neatly.....and engage in frenzied lovemaking.\\
318 -  What if we don't fold our clothes at all?\\
319 -  I d... or...\\
320 -  what if we fold them?\\
321 -  Well, here's your key back.\\
322 -  Thank you.\\
323 -  As soon as I have the place set up I'm gonna have you guys over.\\
324 -  Oh, we would love that.\\
325 -  I really can't thank you enough for taking me in.\\
326 -  You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life, and...\\
327 -  SHELDON: Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen.\\
328 -  Anyway, uh, as I was saying,     I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh,     if it wasn't for friends like you...\\
329 -  AMY: My goodness, that form of stimulation     is highly efficient.\\
330 -  I can't compete with that.\\
331 - Bye.\\
332 -  Should we give them their privacy?\\
333 -  I want to, but I don't think I can.\\
334 -  SHELDON: Whoopee!\\
335 - Okay, I'm good now.\\
336 -  Okay, the car is waiting.\\
337 -  Do you want to walk me downstairs?\\
338 -  Of course.\\
339 -  Here, here, let me.\\
340 -  I've been doing a little research on New Jersey,     and I was delighted to learn     that their chief agricultural product     is sod.\\
341 -  - Is it?\\
342 - - Hmm, yes.\\
343 -  Yeah, perhaps I've been harder on them than they deserve.\\
344 -  Do you think it's possible     you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?\\
345 -  It's hard to say.\\
346 -  I've never really lived by myself.\\
347 -  What if I become strange and eccentric?\\
348 -  I'll love you no matter what.\\
349 -  Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.\\
350 -  We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\\
351 -  And you'll text me when you arrive at the airport?\\
352 -  I will.\\
353 -  - And when you're at the gate?\\
354 - - Uh-huh.\\
355 -  And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones     in first class?\\
356 -  I don't know what they look like, but sure.\\
357 -  Oh.\\
358 -  And don't forget to Skype me when you arrive.\\
359 -  I won't.\\
360 -  - And every morning.\\
361 - - Got it.\\
362 -  Now of course, my  :   a.m. is your noon,     so let's avoid the whole "good morning,"     "good afternoon" minefield,     and let's just say, "Hello."     Good thinking.\\
363 -  And just remember, I am proud of you     and I support you in all that you do.\\
364 -  Thank you.\\
365 - That means a lot.\\
366 -  Oh, and one last thing.\\
367 -  If you find yourself working with a male scientist     who's as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor,     well, then I want you to step away from the situation     and call me immediately.

12 - How are you settling in?\\
13 - AMY: Pretty well.\\
14 - Princeton has a beautiful campus.\\
15 - Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey    to help you make small talk.\\
16 - Would you like to know    the state bird or the murder rate?\\
17 - They're both shocking.\\
18 - Actually, I want to hear about you.\\
19 - How are things at home?\\
20 - Well, I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch    or be murdered, I'll tell you that.\\
21 - I miss you.\\
22 - I miss you, too.\\
23 - It's so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence    with a preposition    and you weren't there to correct my grammar.\\
24 - I'm sorry you had to go through that.\\
25 - In fact,    that's when I started to really miss you.\\
26 - You know you just split an infinitive.\\
27 - Did I?\\
28 - Are you gonna teach me a lesson?\\
29 - I am.\\
30 - It is naughty to put an adverb    between the word "to" and the verb stem.\\
31 - What are you gonna do about it?\\
32 - I'm going to admonish you.\\
33 - Vigorously?\\
34 - That's the only kind of admonishing I do.\\
35 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?\\
36 - Well, the last three nights    I've had to take him to get a haircut,    to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia    where they still have the "good ibuprofen."    Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.\\
37 - How are you doing with... Shut up.\\
38 - If you'd like, we can help you out.\\
39 - Oh, that would be great.\\
40 - I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child,    but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.\\
41 - It was a tutorial.\\
42 - And yes, I'm happy to keep Sheldon company.\\
43 - Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.\\
44 - Oh, why does he need a ladder?\\
45 - He doesn't; he just likes looking at them.\\
46 - Bring a book.\\
47 - Gentlemen.\\
48 - You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,    She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.\\
49 - - Hello.\\
50 - - Hello.\\
51 - - Hi.\\
52 - Oh, let me bring a chair for you.\\
53 - Oh, thanks.\\
54 - Dr. Nowitzki's going to tell me    about the work she did at CERN.\\
55 - And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.\\
56 - Oh. I love those.\\
57 - Let's sit somewhere else.\\
58 - What just happened?\\
59 - A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.\\
60 - Wait, isn't she the grad student that used to follow him around?\\
61 - Oh, yeah.\\
62 - Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.\\
63 - So what do you guys think that's about?\\
64 - Knowing Sheldon, nothing.\\
65 - So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.\\
66 - Not 'til you tell me about your latest paper    on quantum loop theory.\\
67 - Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.\\
68 - (laughs)\\
69 - He just made her laugh, something's wrong.\\
70 - Do you see the way she's looking at him?\\
71 -  Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.\\
72 -  I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.\\
73 -  Ah, did you see that?\\
74 -  She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away.\\
75 -  What is happening?\\
76 -  Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.\\
77 -  Which is?\\
78 -  That ain't Sheldon.\\
79 -  Not only did they eat together,     Leonard said he made her laugh.\\
80 -  That's nothing,     Howie said she touched his hand.\\
81 -  Did he Purell?\\
82 -  No.\\
83 -  I cannot believe Leonard     mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.\\
84 -  Should we call Amy?\\
85 -  I don't know; we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.\\
86 -  I guess we could wait till we have more information     about this girl. Yeah.\\
87 -  (sighs) Do you think living with Amy     has somehow stirred up Sheldon's...   sexual appetite?\\
88 -  Ugh.\\
89 -  How can you think that?\\
90 -  Why would you even put those words together?\\
91 -  All right, then we agree.\\
92 -  He's not making any moves,     it's this Dr. Ramona chick.\\
93 -  Nowitzki.\\
94 - I Googled her, she's pretty cute.\\
95 -  Really?\\
96 - All I got from Leonard     was the Toblerone bar had nuts.\\
97 -  (gasps)\\
98 - And get this,     I saw an articulating ladder     with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability     and adaptability to uneven terrain.\\
99 -  Sounds like a big night.\\
100 -  Yeah.\\
101 - Raj made the funniest joke, he said,     "Which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"     (laughs)\\
102 -  So you're keeping busy?\\
103 - You're not lonely?\\
104 -  Oh, not at all.\\
105 -  I've had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening,     and-- oh, I had lunch with Dr. Nowitzki.\\
106 -  Who's he?\\
107 -  Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.\\
108 -  Oh.\\
109 - Really?\\
110 -  Uh, when did you meet her?\\
111 -  Many years ago.\\
112 -  Back when she was a grad student.\\
113 -  She's always been a huge fan of my work,     and now she's doing research at Caltech.\\
114 -  Huge fan, you say?\\
115 -  Yes.\\
116 - I think you'd like her.\\
117 -  She's extremely intelligent, just like you.\\
118 -  Unlike you, she's tall, blonde     and used to be an Olympic swimmer.\\
119 -  That's terrific.\\
120 - I'll call you right back.\\
121 -  (Skype rings)\\
122 -  Oh, hey, Amy.\\
123 -  I gave you one job!\\
124 -  Keep an eye on him.\\
125 -  How hard is that?\\
126 -  We thought you meant     not letting him run out into traffic.\\
127 -  Which he only did once.\\
128 -  Yeah.\\
129 -  Why didn't you tell me?\\
130 -  We didn't want you to worry.\\
131 -  Should I worry?\\
132 -  No.\\
133 - Come on, it's Sheldon.\\
134 -  Nothing is gonna happen.\\
135 -  That's what you said to me when I started dating him.\\
136 -  And then five years later,     bingo-bango, something happened.\\
137 -  Yeah, but you're gonna be back in three months.\\
138 -  (sighs)\\
139 - You don't get it.\\
140 -  I've been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time.\\
141 -  All she's got to do is tip it over     and point it at her fries.\\
142 -  Well, what do you want us to do?\\
143 -  I don't know.\\
144 -  Might be the New Jersey talking,     but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.\\
145 -  That's ridiculous.\\
146 -  As far as we know,     all that happened is two scientists had lunch.\\
147 -  Yeah, but one of those scientists     is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.\\
148 -  Come on.\\
149 - Looks don't matter to Sheldon.\\
150 -  Because he only has eyes for you.\\
151 -  Nice try.\\
152 -  Thanks.\\
153 - I was scrambling.\\
154 -  It's unbelievable.\\
155 -  Sheldon has lunch with another woman     and somehow my wife yells at me.\\
156 -  Penny laid into me, too.\\
157 -  Apparently, I'm overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars.\\
158 -  Can you even eat those things?\\
159 -  If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before     and some Pepto right after.\\
160 -  Sounds like a lot of work.\\
161 -  Yeah.\\
162 - Eh, I'm worth it.\\
163 -  Guys.\\
164 - Focus.\\
165 -  Should we do something about Nowitzki?\\
166 -  Like what?\\
167 -  Uh, well, she's single,     so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes,     then we know she's not into Sheldon.\\
168 -  I'll do it.\\
169 -  No offense, Stuart,     but Th-Th-the woman's a doctor.\\
170 -  So?\\
171 - Doctors like me.\\
172 -  Whenever I see mine he calls in     a bunch of other doctors to have a look.\\
173 -  She's not that kind of doctor.\\
174 -  STUART: Oh.\\
175 -  Well, her loss.\\
176 -  I've been called a genuine medical oddity.\\
177 -  Actually, I was going to suggest me.\\
178 -  Great.\\
179 - Anybody's better than, mmm.\\
180 -  Excuse me.\\
181 -  They took out my spleen and gallbladder,     not my feelings.\\
182 -  (sighs)\\
183 -  (clears throat)\\
184 -  Dr. Nowitzki.\\
185 -  Good to see you.\\
186 - Good to see you, too.\\
187 -  May I join you?\\
188 -  No.\\
189 -  Good to see you.\\
190 -  We should call Guinness, that might be a record.\\
191 -  She's clearly having a working lunch     and preferred to eat alone.\\
192 -  Dr. Cooper, over here.\\
193 -  I could have made her very happy.\\
194 -  You kept walking.\\
195 - I think you did.\\
196 -  Do you really think there's reason to worry?\\
197 -  Yeah, she's definitely going after Sheldon.\\
198 -  I made a play for her and she shot me down.\\
199 -  All right, well, that doesn't prove anything.\\
200 -  Yeah, there's a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.\\
201 -  Like, really, a million?\\
202 -  Fine, hundreds.\\
203 -  Thank you.\\
204 -  The point is this could be nothing     and we are all overreacting.\\
205 -  Hey, everybody.\\
206 -  This is my friend,     Dr. Nowitzki.\\
207 - Hi.\\
208 -  ALL: Hi.\\
209 -  We just went swimming.\\
210 -  And you actually got in a pool?\\
211 -  I was scared,     but I told myself it's just a big bathtub.\\
212 -  Then I got scared again 'cause there are     all these strangers in my bathtub.\\
213 -  I was proud of him-- a lot of people     don't put their face in the water on the first day.\\
214 -  Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.\\
215 -  Can I just squeeze in here?\\
216 -  So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?\\
217 -  Yes, we Skyped this morning     and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep.\\
218 -  RAMONA: Sheldon talks about her     all the time.\\
219 - I can't wait to meet her.\\
220 -  That is true.\\
221 -  She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone.\\
222 -  Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself.\\
223 -  Do you, do you have a boyfriend?\\
224 -  Leonard, your wife is sitting right here.\\
225 -  What are you doing?\\
226 -  No, my work doesn't leave me a lot of time for relationships.\\
227 -  I think you made that very clear.\\
228 -  She was part of the American team at CERN.\\
229 -  I had a front row seat when they detected the Higgs boson.\\
230 -  SHELDON: Do you know,     I've corresponded with Peter Higgs.\\
231 -  Would you like to see some of his letters?\\
232 -  Absolutely.\\
233 - I'll get them.\\
234 -  Well, hang on, I'll come with you.\\
235 -  Oh, fun.\\
236 -  Like a play date.\\
237 -  (door closes)\\
238 -  Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that exactly     what we were supposed to stop from happening?\\
239 -  I threw my body at them,     what else did you want me to do?\\
240 -  You think you should call Amy?\\
241 -  You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.\\
242 -  Here you go.\\
243 -  Are these all from Peter Higgs?\\
244 -  Hmm?\\
245 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
246 -  They're from many famous people.\\
247 -  See?\\
248 - Oh, like this one.\\
249 -  This is from Patrick Stewart.\\
250 -  It says if I come to his house again,     I get to meet his dogs.\\
251 -  (Skype rings)\\
252 -  Oh, excuse me.\\
253 -  Hello, Sheldon.\\
254 - Oh, hello, Amy.\\
255 -  I was missing you again.\\
256 -  I miss you, too.\\
257 -  Hey, this is good timing.\\
258 -  Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about?\\
259 -  She's right here.\\
260 -  Sh-she's what?\\
261 -  Hello.\\
262 -  Hi.\\
263 -  So nice to meet you.\\
264 -  Uh-huh.\\
265 -  (phone rings)\\
266 -  Hang on.\\
267 -  Hello.\\
268 -  A little late, Leonard.\\
269 -  I'm sorry.\\
270 -  What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?\\
271 -  It's not important.\\
272 -  I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate.\\
273 -  Don't you agree?\\
274 -  I do.\\
275 -  See?\\
276 -  We both think so.\\
277 -  All right, this is making me crazy.\\
278 -  Somebody's got to go over there.\\
279 -  You got feet and legs, you do it.\\
280 -  Will you with me?\\
281 -  To do what?\\
282 - Shake a can of nickels at them?\\
283 -  We're being ridiculous.\\
284 -  There's no way a woman that attractive     is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.\\
285 -  You done trying to make yourself feel better?\\
286 -  No.\\
287 - I haven't played the race card yet.\\
288 -  Hey, I hate to break up the party,     but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed.\\
289 -  It was nice seeing everybody.\\
290 -  Thank you for dinner.\\
291 -  Sure. Our pleasure.\\
292 -  Whatever.\\
293 -  Walk me to my car?\\
294 -  Of course.\\
295 -  We'll all go.\\
296 -  Excuse me.\\
297 -  Pardon.\\
298 - I just need to... yeah.\\
299 -  (laughing): That was fun.\\
300 -  It was like Mario Kart.\\
301 -  Bye.\\
302 -  We need to talk.\\
303 -  Wh-- Is this about Leonard and Amy?\\
304 -  I don't like it either.\\
305 -  Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience with women,     but Ramona seems to have     a romantic interest in you.\\
306 -  That doesn't make any sense.\\
307 -  She knows I have a girlfriend.\\
308 -  Well, sometimes women don't care.\\
309 -  Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.\\
310 -  That may be true,     but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend.\\
311 -  In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed she's a woman     if she hadn't worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.\\
312 -  Okay.\\
313 - Um...\\
314 - (clears throat) ...let's try this.\\
315 -  Think of yourself as one of those     limited edition toys people like to collect.\\
316 -  I already do.\\
317 -  Well, then you get it.\\
318 -  (gasps)\\
319 - Because there's only one of me,     I'm more valuable.\\
320 -  Right.\\
321 -  Although, Amy's already taken me     out of my package and played with me.\\
322 -  Let's forget the toy thing, okay?\\
323 -  Um, maybe...\\
324 - Penny, look.\\
325 - I appreciate your concern,     but I don't think that's what's happening.\\
326 -  All right.\\
327 - What do you think is happening?\\
328 -  I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague.\\
329 -  I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counselor.\\
330 -  And I need to update my résumé     to include swimming as a special skill.\\
331 -  Don't look at me like that, I tried.\\
332 -  (knocking at door)\\
333 -  Hey, did you eat yet?\\
334 -  Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no.\\
335 -  I did have a cough drop,     but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.\\
336 -  Well, perfect.\\
337 - I made us sandwiches.\\
338 -  How thoughtful.\\
339 -  Thank you.\\
340 -  Mmm.\\
341 - No big deal,     I enjoy spending time with you.\\
342 -  And I with you.\\
343 -  Question:     are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?\\
344 -  What if I were?\\
345 -  Well, that would raise a number of problems.\\
346 -  We're colleagues.\\
347 -  I'm currently in a relation...\\
348 -  Excuse me a moment.\\
349 -  (seat belt bell chimes)\\
350 -  (laughs)\\
351 -  Amy.\\
352 -  Amy.\\
353 - (knocks again)\\
354 -  (knocks again)\\
355 - Amy.\\
356 -  Will you marry me?
\section {The Big Bang Theory Season 11}
\subsection {Episode 01: The Proposal Proposal}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.\\
3 - A fine institution.\\
4 - The place where Albert Einstein taught,   and where Leonard got his PhD,   so it may have gone downhill.\\
5 - Gentlemen, you may remember Dr. Nowitzki.\\
6 - She's back at Caltech for her postdoc.\\
7 - - Hello.\\
8 - GUYS: Hi.\\
9 - Question:    are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?\\
10 - What if I were?\\
11 - Well, that would raise a number of problems.\\
12 - We're colleagues, I'm currently in a relation...\\
13 - (knocking)\\
14 - SHELDON: Amy?\\
15 - Amy.\\
16 - (knocking continues)\\
17 - Amy?\\
18 - Will you marry me?\\
19 - (ringtone playing)\\
20 - One moment, please.\\
21 - Really, you're going to answer that right now?\\
22 - It's Leonard.\\
23 - I don't want to be rude.\\
24 - Hello?\\
25 - Oh, hey, where you been?\\
26 - We've been calling you for hours.\\
27 - Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was on "airplane" mode.\\
28 - Why?\\
29 - Because I was on an airplane.\\
30 - Hey, put him on speaker.\\
31 - - Yeah.\\
32 - - Hey, where are you?\\
33 - I came to Princeton to see Amy.\\
34 - It's a funny story, actually.\\
35 - I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki,    and she kissed me.\\
36 - - Excuse me?\\
37 - - What?\\
38 - I'm sorry?\\
39 - And in that moment, I realized    that Amy was the only woman I ever wanted to kiss    for the rest of my life.\\
40 - So I came to New Jersey to ask her to marry me.\\
41 - Oh, that's so sweet.\\
42 - (chuckling)\\
43 - - Sheldon...\\
44 - - Yeah, although    there was one man whose blessing I needed first.\\
45 - I've thought about it, and I really want to spend    the rest of my life with Amy.\\
46 - Do I have your blessing?\\
47 - Well, Sheldon...    ...\\
48 - I think you should make her finger like Saturn    and put a ring on it.\\
49 - You asked Stephen Hawking and not her father?\\
50 - SHELDON: Stephen Hawking's a genius.\\
51 - If he said no, I wasn't gonna waste my time on her father.\\
52 - But you did ask my father?\\
53 - I did.\\
54 - He said yes.\\
55 - Although, not in a robot voice, so it wasn't nearly as cool.\\
56 - Okay.\\
57 - Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys are engaged.\\
58 - We're not engaged, yet.\\
59 - She's taking forever to answer.\\
60 - Because you're on the phone!\\
61 - We'll call you back.\\
62 - (ringtone chiming)\\
63 - SHELDON: She said yes.\\
64 - Yay!\\
65 - Congratulations!\\
66 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
67 - Wait!\\
68 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Mother, I have some good news to share.\\
69 - We're engaged.\\
70 - I am so happy for you two, but I'm not surprised.\\
71 - I've been praying for this.\\
72 - Well, God had nothing to do with it.\\
73 - It happened because I was kissing another woman,    and it made me realize I wanted to be with Amy.\\
74 - More than one woman was interested in you?\\
75 - I might have prayed a little too hard.\\
76 - Wait, oh, and I just...\\
77 - I want to let you know right now    that we are not getting married in a church.\\
78 - That's all right, Sheldon.\\
79 - Anywhere Jesus is is a church.\\
80 - Well, he won't be at our wedding.\\
81 - He's in my heart, so if I'm there,    he'll be there.\\
82 - Okay, well, then, he's your plus-one.\\
83 - You don't get to bring anyone else.\\
84 - That's fine.\\
85 - Love you.\\
86 - Love you, too.\\
87 - Bye.\\
88 - Lord, thank you.\\
89 - Even though you can do anything,    that was mighty impressive.\\
90 - We're engaged.\\
91 - Oh, my God, that's amazing!\\
92 -  Wait, uh, tell me everything.\\
93 -  Well, Dr.\\
94 - Nowitzki was kissing me...\\
95 -  Okay, you can stop leading with that part of the story.\\
96 -  Well, congratulations.\\
97 -  I'm so happy for you two.\\
98 -  Hold on, I have to tell Bernadette.\\
99 -  Hey, Bernie, guess what?\\
100 -  Sheldon and Amy got engaged.\\
101 - Can you believe it?\\
102 -  Oh, my God.\\
103 - I cannot believe it.\\
104 -  She's so happy...\\
105 - I think she's crying.\\
106 -  Do you think Sheldon's gonna want     some weird Star Trek wedding?\\
107 -  I don't know.\\
108 -  Well, Leonard could barely finish the words     "Doctor Who wedding cake"     before I shut that down hard.\\
109 -  Mm-hmm.\\
110 -  Are you listening to me?\\
111 -  Yeah, you're mean to Leonard.\\
112 - I heard you.\\
113 -  Is everything okay?\\
114 -  Look, I'm gonna tell you something,     but you can't freak out,     because I'm already freaking out.\\
115 -  Oh, my God, what is it?\\
116 -  I'm pregnant again.\\
117 -  Wha...\\
118 -  Interesting.\\
119 -  Howard's gonna lose his mind.\\
120 -  Wait, you haven't told him yet?\\
121 -  No.\\
122 -  You told me first?\\
123 - Oh, Bernie!\\
124 -  This wasn't supposed to happen-- we were careful.\\
125 -  Yeah, I didn't even think you could get pregnant     while you were breastfeeding.\\
126 -  Well, guess what?\\
127 - You can.\\
128 -  Okay, look, look, this is a good thing.\\
129 -  Halley's gonna have a little brother     or sister to play with.\\
130 -  I guess that would be pretty cute.\\
131 -  And, you, know, I was a surprise to my parents,     and my dad said it was the best thing     that ever happened to them.\\
132 -  Okay.\\
133 - Maybe this baby actually is a blessing.\\
134 -  Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.\\
135 -  (exhales)\\
136 -  How am I pregnant again?\\
137 -  Yeah, what were you thinking?\\
138 -  All right, I'm all checked in to my flight.\\
139 -  Well, I'm sad you're leaving.\\
140 -  Why'd you only book a flight for one day?\\
141 -  I came here to propose.\\
142 -  If you'd said no, I wouldn't want to stick around     looking at your stupid face.\\
143 -  Now, mind you, your face is only stupid     in the "no" version of the story.\\
144 -  But I said yes, so I get a lifetime of this.\\
145 -  Yes, you do, smart face.\\
146 -  Why don't you stay a few extra days?\\
147 -  Well, I don't have any other clothes.\\
148 -  We'll get you some.\\
149 -  Oh, I don't know, I'm pretty particular.\\
150 -  Well, there's a comic book store less than a mile from here.\\
151 -  Perfect, let's go shopping.\\
152 -  Oh, um, and I'm having dinner with some colleagues tonight.\\
153 -  I'm sure they'd love to meet you.\\
154 -  (groans)\\
155 -  Come on, what do you say?\\
156 -  Aw, you're nagging me.\\
157 -  It's like we're already married.\\
158 -  Is that a yes or a no?\\
159 -  Geez, save some for the honeymoon.\\
160 -  Look at Nowitzki over there.\\
161 -  LEONARD: I can't believe she tried to steal     Sheldon from Amy.\\
162 -  You know what?\\
163 -  I'm gonna go there and tell her that they're engaged now     and that her little plan didn't work.\\
164 -  Because you're sticking up for Sheldon,     or because you're still mad she rejected you?\\
165 -  Too far away, can't hear you.\\
166 -  Hello, Ramona.\\
167 -  Mm.\\
168 - Hello.\\
169 -  Why are you sitting by yourself?\\
170 -  Oh, that's right,     Sheldon's in New Jersey being engaged to Amy.\\
171 -  I heard.\\
172 -  Now that Sheldon's out of the picture,     I could give you one more chance to go out with me.\\
173 -  Nope, I'm good.\\
174 -  You sure?\\
175 -  I will not ask again.\\
176 -  I sincerely hope not.\\
177 -  Very well.\\
178 -  I'm going to leave before this gets awkward.\\
179 -  Hey.\\
180 -  Want me to make dinner?\\
181 -  Uh, sure, but first, why don't you have a seat?\\
182 -  There's something I need to show you.\\
183 -  Ooh, if it's how to make dinner, that'd be great.\\
184 -  (sighs)\\
185 -  Is this a...\\
186 - pregnancy test?\\
187 -  Yes.\\
188 -  That means...\\
189 - positive?\\
190 -  Yes.\\
191 -  No.\\
192 -  Yes.\\
193 -  (giggling nervously): N-- No.\\
194 -  Yes.\\
195 -  (high-pitched): No!\\
196 -  How could this even happen?\\
197 -  Uh, w-- we were careful.\\
198 -  - Well, it did.\\
199 - - No!\\
200 -  - Yes!\\
201 - Yes!\\
202 - - No!\\
203 - No!\\
204 -  - No!\\
205 - No!\\
206 - - Yes!\\
207 - Yes!\\
208 - Yes!\\
209 -  Okay!\\
210 - Okay!\\
211 - Okay!\\
212 -  Well, w-what are we gonna do?\\
213 -  What do you mean what are we gonna do?\\
214 -  We're gonna have another baby.\\
215 -  - No!\\
216 - No!\\
217 - - Stop that!\\
218 -  - Yes!\\
219 - - I'm trying!\\
220 -  Look, I know it's scary, but...\\
221 -  we're both responsible adults, we can do this.\\
222 -  You really think so?\\
223 -  (crying): No!\\
224 -  Hey, Stuart.\\
225 - Oh, hey, Raj.\\
226 -  What can I help you with?\\
227 -  I need to buy an engagement gift.\\
228 -  Well, you came to the wrong place.\\
229 -  It's for Sheldon and Amy.\\
230 -  No way!\\
231 - They're engaged?\\
232 - Yeah.\\
233 -  Well, that's exciting news.\\
234 - (chuckles)\\
235 -  Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy would be the next two     to tie the knot?\\
236 -  Tell me about it.\\
237 - I'm the one     who caught the bouquet at Leonard and Penny's wedding.\\
238 -  Okay.\\
239 -  Uh...\\
240 - you know,     they might like this.\\
241 -  Superman and Wonder Woman, it's kind of romantic.\\
242 -  Hmm.\\
243 -  You know what?\\
244 -  Why am I buying them a gift?\\
245 -  They have love.\\
246 -  Screw them and their happiness.\\
247 -  What do you have for someone who's bitter and alone?\\
248 -  Literally everything.\\
249 -  Sheldon, these are the heads of my research team.\\
250 -  Oh, hello.\\
251 -  AMY: Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,     this is my fiancé, Dr.\\
252 - Sheldon Cooper.\\
253 -  That's the first time I've said that     and it kind of gave me the goose bumps.\\
254 -  (chuckles)\\
255 - Dr. Cooper,     we are so excited to meet you.\\
256 - SHELDON: Oh.\\
257 -  Well, that's very kind of you.\\
258 -  If you'd like, I could autograph your menus after dinner, yeah?\\
259 -  But I better not see those on eBay.\\
260 -  (laughs)\\
261 -  No, no, no, we're just excited to meet the man     who landed this brilliant woman here.\\
262 -  (chuckles softly)\\
263 - SHELDON: Oh!\\
264 -  That wasn't hard,     she threw herself at me.\\
265 -  Now, getting the universe to show me its naughty bits,     that-that took some doing.\\
266 -  Sheldon's a physicist.\\
267 -  Oh.\\
268 - Oh, that's nice.\\
269 -  Amy, I recently read your paper on lesions     in the olfactory receptors in the brain.\\
270 -  It was inspired.\\
271 -  Oh, well, I guess it didn't stink.\\
272 -  But if it did, that rat wouldn't have known it.\\
273 -  (laughter)\\
274 - I'm sorry,     I'm sure you don't want to sit here     and listen to a bunch of work talk.\\
275 -  Oh, no, I love it.\\
276 -  No, but let's talk about work.\\
277 -  Amy's work, my work.\\
278 -  Yeah, why don't we start with my work?\\
279 -  Actually, I do have a question for Dr. Cooper.\\
280 -  When Amy first told you about     her approach to synaptic tracing,     did you think it was gonna revolutionize the field?\\
281 -  (stammers)\\
282 - Really?\\
283 -  That's your question?\\
284 -  What are you, Entertainment Tonight?     You know what?\\
285 -  Let me give you a better question.\\
286 - Here,     um, "Dr. Cooper,     "I heard you were working on a top-secret project     "for the U.S. military.\\
287 -  Why don't you tell us about that?"     See, that's a great question.\\
288 -  Okay, what was that like?\\
289 -  Oh, I can't tell you that, it's top-secret.\\
290 -  Boy, that was exhausting.\\
291 -  You know, no offense, but your colleagues were pretty rude.\\
292 -  Really, they were rude?\\
293 -  Yes.\\
294 -  They just kept talking about you     and how great you are,     no matter how many times I brought me up.\\
295 -  You know, these are my colleagues     and they want to talk about my work.\\
296 -  Why does that bother you so much?\\
297 -  Because I was there.\\
298 -  It's like having Optimus Prime over to dinner     and not asking him to turn into a truck.\\
299 -  You know what, Sheldon?\\
300 -  You're not always the smartest person in every room.\\
301 -  You may not even be the smartest person in this room.\\
302 -  Oh, I am sorry.\\
303 -  What, is Neil deGrasse Tyson hiding behind the couch?\\
304 -  'Cause if he is, he's not that smart,     it's pretty dusty back there.\\
305 -  Hey, where are you going?\\
306 -  I'm storming off to my room.\\
307 -  Well, then where am I supposed to storm off to?\\
308 -  Well, you're so smart, why don't you figure it out?\\
309 -  (door closes)\\
310 -  Is there another bedroom?\\
311 -  Perhaps a-a den?\\
312 -  So, how are you guys doing with all the new     events in your womb?\\
313 -  Good, you know?\\
314 -  Obviously, it was a surprise.\\
315 -  There was some crying     and some yelling.\\
316 - Some suggestion     of make-up s*x that did not go over well,     even though it's not like we can get more pregnant.\\
317 -  But then we realized that it's a gift, in the sense     that we didn't ask for it,     and we may not have chosen it...\\
318 -  And we already have one.\\
319 -  You know, whenever I find a top I like,     I always go back and get a second one in a different color.\\
320 -  Which I hope is not the case with your baby.\\
321 -  I know you guys are freaked out, but you're great parents,     and if you ever need help, we are here for you.\\
322 -  Yeah, anything at all, just ask.\\
323 -  Ooh, you know what you could do?\\
324 -  You could have a baby, too.\\
325 -  I'm sorry, what?\\
326 -  No, that's a great idea, we could go through it together.\\
327 -  Wouldn't that be fun?\\
328 -  (chuckles)\\
329 -  You guys were just saying     how freaked out and miserable you are.\\
330 -  I say lots of crazy things.\\
331 -  I'm pregnant and hormonal.\\
332 -  Do it!\\
333 - Have a baby, do it!\\
334 -  Come on, it'd be so cute, our kids playing together?\\
335 -  What do you say, why don't you two hit the old mattress     and whip up a family?\\
336 -  Okay, we're not gonna have a baby     just to make you guys feel better.\\
337 -  Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby it's gonna be when we are ready,     or when I'm certain Penny is gonna leave me.\\
338 -  Exactly.\\
339 -  They're my friends, and I should be happy for them.\\
340 -  A-And I'm trying,     but all I feel is this gnawing, empty sensation in my gut.\\
341 -  I had that once.\\
342 -  Turned out it was a tapeworm.\\
343 -  Cool.\\
344 - Uh...\\
345 -  It's just...\\
346 -  it's hard talking to my other friends about this,     but I knew you would understand.\\
347 -  Why is that?\\
348 -  Because you and I are both alone,     which is actually kind of comforting,     because at least we can be alone together.\\
349 -  Mm.\\
350 - This is-this is awkward.\\
351 -  I, um, I was actually gonna close up a little early tonight     'cause I have a date.\\
352 -  Really?\\
353 -  Yeah.\\
354 -  (clears throat)\\
355 -  Forgive me if I'm having trouble being happy for you.\\
356 -  Don't be silly, I'm loving your pain.\\
357 -  Is this how our marriage is going to be?\\
358 -  Sometimes people will be more interested     in talking to her than to me?\\
359 -  Are you sitting in a bathroom?\\
360 -  Yes.\\
361 -  I needed a place to storm off to     and it was all that was available.\\
362 -  Fine.\\
363 -  But if I hear a flush, this conversation is over.\\
364 -  Those people were in the presence of a world-class mind,     and all they wanted to talk about was their own nonsense.\\
365 -  Can you see the irony in that statement?\\
366 -  How about now?\\
367 -  How about now?\\
368 -  I'll wait.\\
369 -  LEONARD: Uh...\\
370 -  Surprise.\\
371 -  Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?\\
372 -  No.\\
373 -  Wait.\\
374 -  No.\\
375 -  No.\\
376 -  All right, so what are we celebrating?\\
377 -  Well, you know, Bernadette and Howard are pregnant again,     and Amy and Sheldon are getting married.\\
378 -  I didn't want you to feel left out.\\
379 -  Ah.\\
380 - Left out?\\
381 -  Well, Bernadette has to grow a baby inside of her,     and Amy has to marry one.\\
382 -  My life is great.\\
383 -  So do you not want the cake?\\
384 -  Try and take it away, see what happens.\\
385 -  Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.\\
386 -  Happy anniversary!\\
387 -  Amy.\\
388 -  There's something I need to say to you.\\
389 -  I'm listening.\\
390 -  I've been thinking about the Avengers.\\
391 -  I believe that.\\
392 -  But I don't think that's something     you needed to say to me.\\
393 -  I realized that Iron Man is great.\\
394 -  And also,     that Captain America is great.\\
395 -  And sometimes, Iron Man is in a Captain America movie,     and he's not mad it's not an Iron Man movie.\\
396 -  You know, he can fly in, give the audience a thrill,     and then fly away.\\
397 -  And that should've been me tonight.\\
398 -  I should've been the delightful cameo in your movie.\\
399 -  Thank you, Sheldon.\\
400 -  Instead, I was like the Hulk, and I...\\
401 -  Okay, please stop talking about the Avengers.\\
402 -  Anyway.\\
403 -  I'm proud of you.\\
404 -  And I'm going to try to do a better job     of sharing the spotlight because we're a team.\\
405 -  You know?\\
406 - Much like t-the Dodgers.\\
407 -  If they had superpowers, and fought crime.\\
408 -  And Thor was in them.\\
409 -  Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,     but you'll have a whole lifetime to practice.\\
410 -  I-It could take that long, I'm really bad at it.\\
411 -  You know, maybe, um,     I should start right now, and go back to Pasadena     and let you have this experience to yourself.\\
412 -  You just want to go back     'cause that's where everybody makes a fuss over you.\\
413 -  You know, your colleagues are right, you are brilliant.\\
414 -  Hello.\\
415 -  - Hey.\\
416 - - Hey.\\
417 - - Amy, welcome back.\\
418 -  Oh, l-let me see the ring.\\
419 -  Ooh, nice.\\
420 -  H-Hey, her eyes are up there.\\
421 -  I-Is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?\\
422 -  Uh...\\
423 - Could be.\\
424 -  Hard to say.\\
425 - Tell us about Princeton.\\
426 -  Excuse me for a minute.\\
427 -  Not-- well, we'll catch up later.\\
428 -  This is going to be the biggest smackdown     since my Aunt Noopur showed up at the family reunion     wearing the same sari as my cousin Sruti.\\
429 -  Dr. Nowitzki?\\
430 -  Oh.\\
431 -  Dr. Fowler.\\
432 - Um, hello.\\
433 -  Thank you.\\
434 - Thank you so much.
\subsection {Episode 02: The Retraction Reaction}
1 - Uh, One dumpling left.\\
2 - Who wants it?\\
3 - Maybe you should offer it to the pregnant lady.\\
4 - And that would be...\\
5 - Me, Sheldon.\\
6 - I'm obviously pregnant.\\
7 - Well, you never said it to my face.\\
8 - And the last time I assumed a woman was pregnant,   it did not go over well.\\
9 - Yeah, I'm still mad at you.\\
10 - (clears throat)\\
11 - You were drinking water instead of wine.\\
12 - What was I supposed to think?\\
13 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Sheldon's right.\\
14 - I would never ask a woman if she was pregnant,    unless she tells me or I see a human being    wiggling out of her.\\
15 - Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.\\
16 - Congratulations.\\
17 - How far along are you?\\
18 - About three months.\\
19 - Only three?\\
20 - Good gravy, how many babies are in there?\\
21 - Okay, let's talk about something    that won't infuriate my pregnant wife.\\
22 - I read an interesting fact about elephants.\\
23 - Try again.\\
24 - Oh, I've got something.\\
25 - I'm being interviewed on public radio this Friday.\\
26 - Oh, cool.\\
27 - How come?\\
28 - Uh, the university is trying to get more funding    for the physics department,    so they want me to go out and talk it up.\\
29 - Really?\\
30 - You?\\
31 - (whispering indistinctly)\\
32 - Well, they picked the right person for the job.\\
33 - Thank you.\\
34 - I think he bought it.\\
35 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
36 - Wait!\\
37 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Hi, I'm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday.    Joining me today    is my guest physicist, Dr.\\
38 - Leonard Hofstadter,    to talk about    all of the exciting research they're doing at Cal Tech.\\
39 - Thank you for having me.\\
40 - Whoa...\\
41 - (chuckles)\\
42 - Could never get used to hearing myself in headphones.\\
43 - Is that really how I sound?\\
44 - (chuckles)\\
45 - It is.\\
46 - It is.\\
47 - (deep voice): That is good to know.\\
48 - I told him his voice was annoying.\\
49 - He didn't want to listen.\\
50 - Hey...\\
51 - You're saying it's not?\\
52 - Just...\\
53 - hey.\\
54 - FLATOW: So, it has been five years    since the discovery of the Higgs boson--    what's the next big thing gonna be?\\
55 - Wow, that's hard to say.\\
56 - There's so much going on.\\
57 - We've been collecting tons of data    that could revolutionize the way we understand the universe.\\
58 - For instance, there's a particle called a squark,    which could prove supersymmetry.\\
59 - That is interesting.\\
60 - Have you found it?\\
61 - - What, the squark?\\
62 - - Yes.\\
63 - No, no.\\
64 - Wouldn't that be exciting?\\
65 - But we're also looking for the selectron,    the gluino and the neutralino.\\
66 - - Well, and have you found that?\\
67 - - No.\\
68 - LEONARD: Another fun sidenote--    I went to high school with a girl named Theresa Gluino,    but it didn't cost $  billion to find her.\\
69 - She was smoking behind the gym.\\
70 - (laughs)\\
71 - So, what have you found?\\
72 - Uh, nothing, actually.\\
73 - Should he be saying that?\\
74 - Uh, probably not.\\
75 - Yeah, this is public radio.\\
76 - Doesn't he realize that dozens of people might hear him?\\
77 - But I remain confident.\\
78 - We've got the best equipment and the best minds    all working on it.\\
79 - Okay, sounds like he's back on track.\\
80 - LEONARD: Although, some days    I'm, like, ugh...\\
81 - we've spent so much money.    Why haven't we found anything? What are we doing?    Oh, boy.\\
82 - There's Leonard.\\
83 - I'll bet he's having a rough day.\\
84 - (chuckles)\\
85 - Let's just try to be supportive.\\
86 - Supportive?\\
87 -  He publicly maligned the love of my life,     Lady Physics.\\
88 -  You might not want to mention that to Lady Fiancée.\\
89 -  Hey, guys.\\
90 -  KOOTHRAPPALI: Hey, how's it going?\\
91 -  (scoffs)\\
92 -  What?\\
93 - You got something to say?\\
94 -  I think I just said it.\\
95 -  P-F-F.\\
96 -  Pff!\\
97 -  Look, I-I was just speaking the truth.\\
98 -  We're scientists-- isn't that what we're supposed to do?\\
99 -  Oh, what would you know about the truth?\\
100 -  You thought Phantom Menace was "not half bad."     I told you that in confidence!\\
101 -  Okay, calm down.\\
102 - Everybody just cool it.\\
103 -  No, let 'em go.\\
104 - If we get lucky,     maybe one of them will start crying.\\
105 -  Uh, can we just drop this and have lunch like adults?\\
106 -  - Fine.\\
107 - - Very well.\\
108 -  - Leonard?\\
109 - - What?\\
110 -  Pff!\\
111 -  (knock on door)\\
112 -  You ready for lunch?\\
113 -  Oh, one second.\\
114 -  Ooh, someone's got a lot of fancy new lab equipment.\\
115 -  I know.\\
116 - The university has been throwing money at my study.\\
117 -  With any luck, there'll be a brain disease     with my name on it.\\
118 -  Fingers crossed.\\
119 -  Which is ironic, because if you had Fowler's palsy,     you wouldn't be able to cross your fingers.\\
120 -  I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here playing     with all your new toys.\\
121 -  Actually, I haven't told him about it.\\
122 -  We've been getting so much more funding than physics,     he's been a little sensitive.\\
123 -  So you're just gonna hide your success from him?\\
124 -  I know.\\
125 -  - Am I terrible?\\
126 - - No.\\
127 -  I do that, too.\\
128 -  How he thought my company retreat was in Boise?\\
129 -  It was in Tahiti.\\
130 -  That's such a relief.\\
131 -  I mean, part of me was worried I was being unfair to Sheldon.\\
132 -  Take that part of yourself and hide it away.\\
133 -  Just like I did with last year's bonus check     that I "didn't get."     (knock on door)\\
134 -  Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?\\
135 -  Yes, Dr. Hofstadter, come on in.\\
136 -  Should I sit or stand?\\
137 -  I'm not used to being called into the dean's office.\\
138 -  Please, sit.\\
139 -  I have to say I'm a little nervous.\\
140 -  You should be.\\
141 -  Look, I know I screwed up,     but it was only one interview.\\
142 -  How much damage could it have caused?\\
143 -  Would you like for me to read you the e-mails     from donors asking why are they giving us money     if physics is a dead end?\\
144 -  I didn't say it was a dead end.\\
145 -  I just said that I was worried it might be.\\
146 -  So if I just said I was worried     you might not have a job next week,     how would you feel?\\
147 -  Light-headed, and glad you asked me to sit down.\\
148 -  Okay, just tell me what I can do.\\
149 -  I'm gonna need you to make a statement     saying that you misspoke, and that you're confident     the physics community is close to a major breakthrough.\\
150 -  You want me to lie.\\
151 -  Look, Dr. Hofstadter, I'm counting on you.\\
152 -  I think that you are the smartest physicist     at this university.\\
153 -  Really?\\
154 -  See?\\
155 - Lies.\\
156 - They're not that hard.\\
157 -  (door opens)\\
158 -  - Hi.\\
159 - - Hello.\\
160 -  Huh.\\
161 - Looks like you've been busy.\\
162 -  Oh, I have.\\
163 -  Uh, dark matter, uh, reconciling gravity     and quantum mechanics.\\
164 -  Supersymmetry.\\
165 -  I've figured out the biggest problems in physics today.\\
166 -  Wow, you solved them all?\\
167 -  No, I just, I figured out that they're the biggest problems.\\
168 -  Is this about what Leonard said on the radio?\\
169 -  Absolutely not.\\
170 -  And I do not want to talk about Leonard.\\
171 -  Can we please just talk about anything else?\\
172 -  We could talk about my day.\\
173 -  Walked right into that one, didn't I?\\
174 -  Well, since you sort of asked,     I actually had a very good day.\\
175 -  Got some new equipment for my lab.\\
176 -  Well, congratulations.\\
177 -  I got some new equipment, too.\\
178 -  I got these markers.\\
179 -  They smell like fruit.\\
180 -  Which I did not notice     when I bought them.\\
181 - (sniffs)\\
182 -  Don't really care for it.\\
183 -  Here, drink this.\\
184 -  It might help.\\
185 -  What if it doesn't?\\
186 -  Well, that's why I brought the bottle.\\
187 -  No one would talk to me in the halls.\\
188 -  They just glared at me.\\
189 -  It's like high school all over again.\\
190 -  Oh, I would totally do high school all over again.\\
191 -  But that doesn't help you.\\
192 - No.\\
193 -  I got called in to the administration office.\\
194 -  Ooh, look at my bad boy getting called to the principal.\\
195 -  We don't technically have a principal.\\
196 -  There's a standing committee that oversees the budget.\\
197 -  Ooh, look at my bad boy answering questions     nobody asked.\\
198 -  Hey, come on, look, you said a few dumb things     on the radio-- what is the worst that could happen?\\
199 -  I may get fired.\\
200 -  Okay, well, even if you did, you could find another job.\\
201 -  Yeah, who wouldn't want to hire the physicist     who publicly said physics is dead?\\
202 -  Well, I wouldn't put that under "special skills."     I can fix it, I just need to write a retraction     I don't believe in-- basically sell out to keep my job.\\
203 -  Great, I'll leave you to it.\\
204 -  Hmm.\\
205 -  Hmm.\\
206 -  Oy.\\
207 -  (knocking on door)\\
208 -  LEONARD: Sheldon, it's me.\\
209 -  What?\\
210 -  Look, I know you're mad, but I have to write a statement     that says the physics community is close to a breakthrough,     and since you actually believe that,     I could really use your help.\\
211 -  Sorry, I can't.\\
212 -  Come on, don't be like that.\\
213 -  I can't, because I think you were right.\\
214 -  What?\\
215 -  Look.\\
216 - (sighs)\\
217 -  Not all science pans out.\\
218 -  You know, we've been hoping     supersymmetry was true for decades,     and finally, we built the Large Hadron Collider,     which is supposed to prove it by finding these new particles,     and it-it hasn't.\\
219 -  And maybe supersymmetry,     our last big idea, is simply wrong.\\
220 -  Well, that sounds awful.\\
221 -  Now I get why everyone hates me.\\
222 -  Well, on the bright side,     after working together for    years,     you finally get to hear me say, "You were right."     Oh, yeah, you did.\\
223 -  How's it feel?\\
224 -  Mm, given I might be unemployed,     bittersweet.\\
225 -  Read it back to me?\\
226 - Oh, hang on.\\
227 -  "Yes, one might question the $   billion     "to build and run the Large Hadron Collider,     but on the other hand..."     Okay.\\
228 - Um...\\
229 -  Oh, oh!\\
230 - "On the other hand, contrary to predictions,     "the collider didn't create a small black hole     "that devoured the Earth and life as we know it.\\
231 -  So, s-- money well spent."     This is depressing.\\
232 -  Do you have any alcohol around here?\\
233 -  Uh, not surprisingly, when Penny moved out,     she took every last drop.\\
234 - Um...\\
235 -  Oh, but I do have several bottles of Romulan ale     that I bought at Comic-Con.\\
236 -  Isn't that just vodka with blue dye in it?\\
237 -  You-- first, physics, now Romulan ale.\\
238 -  What else would you like to defecate on?\\
239 -  Hey.\\
240 - I thought you were coming right back.\\
241 -  I was,     but we're both depressed, and decided     to drown our sorrows.\\
242 -  In mouthwash?\\
243 -  Man, that is so summer camp.\\
244 -  I-It's Romulan ale, from Star Trek.     It was briefly legalized during the alliance     between the Romulan Empire and the Federation     at the time of the Dominion War.\\
245 -  Aw, now I'm depressed.\\
246 -  The more I told him about my lab, the pissier he got.\\
247 -  You know what he said to me?\\
248 -  He said, "I hope all your correlations     turn out to be specious."     He said that to your face?\\
249 -  What a dick.\\
250 -  You know, you're a successful woman.\\
251 -  You should be able to brag about your accomplishments     once in a while.\\
252 -  Well, so should you.\\
253 -  I mean, the guys are never shy about bragging.\\
254 -  Tell me about it.\\
255 - Howie texts me     every time his dog levels up in Warcraft.     Has he ever called you     to tell you he found three peanuts in one shell?\\
256 -  'Cause Sheldon has.\\
257 -  We should be able to do that, too.\\
258 -  I guess we can brag to each other.\\
259 -  That's a great idea.\\
260 -  Damn right it is; I came up with it.\\
261 -  (chuckles)\\
262 -  That felt good.\\
263 -  You know, there's so much money in pharmaceuticals,     we don't even wash out our test tubes.\\
264 -  We just throw them out and get new ones.\\
265 -  I just got a brand-new, state of the art fMRI machine.\\
266 -  Whoa.\\
267 - Those things are so expensive.\\
268 -  I know.\\
269 -  Sometimes, I just lie down in there and take a nap.\\
270 -  Oh.\\
271 -  It's like a million dollar bunk bed.\\
272 -  At the office, I have two assistants.\\
273 -  I don't even know their names,     I just call them Thing One and Thing Two.\\
274 -  That's great.\\
275 - I-I don't have assistants.\\
276 -  Oh.\\
277 - I guess that's one of the benefits     of being in the private sector.\\
278 -  That and all the money I make.\\
279 -  Yeah, you've got that.\\
280 -  I've got my integrity.\\
281 -  Hard to say which is better without making you feel bad.\\
282 -  Okay.\\
283 - So you guys are upset     because the collider thing disproved your theories?\\
284 -  I-It's worse than that.\\
285 -  It hasn't found anything in years, so we don't know     if we're right, we don't know if we're wrong.\\
286 -  We don't know where to go next.\\
287 -  All I know is it looks like I tongue-kissed Avatar.     PENNY: Come on.\\
288 -  You guys are physicists.\\
289 -  Okay?\\
290 - You're always gonna be physicists.\\
291 -  And sure, sometimes, the physics is hard,     but isn't that what makes it boring?\\
292 -  - Hey.\\
293 - - We're here\\
294 -  What's going on?\\
295 -  Okay.\\
296 - As far as I can see, science is dead,     'cause Leonard killed it.\\
297 -  And, uh,     I don't know who the Romulans are,     but those guys know how to party.\\
298 -  So, what do you want us to do?\\
299 -  I don't know.\\
300 - You're scientists; cheer them up.\\
301 -  "Cheer them up"?\\
302 -  Do you even know what a scientist is?\\
303 -  No, we don't need to be cheered up.\\
304 -  It just turns out that physics is exactly like Lost.     Started out great, and turns out just a big old waste of time.\\
305 -  Boo-hoo.\\
306 - You know what you sound like?\\
307 -  Babies.\\
308 -  Two whiny babies.\\
309 -  And there's nothing worse than being stuck     with two whiny babies!\\
310 -  Oh.\\
311 -  Oh, my God, I'm gonna have two babies.\\
312 -  No, no, no, no.\\
313 - Babies are great.\\
314 -  You're lucky to have two babies.\\
315 -  I mean, look at me, uh, I'm all alone.\\
316 -  I'm never gonna have babies,     'cause you can't make a baby watching Netflix with your dog.\\
317 -  Thanks for coming.\\
318 -  I may not make as much money as you,     but at least I know that I'm actually doing something     that makes people's lives better.\\
319 -  Hey, my work makes people's lives better.\\
320 -  Especially if you have moderate to severe eczema     and don't mind if you lose teeth.\\
321 -  You're right.\\
322 -  We both do important work.\\
323 -  I'm trying to map the structures of the brain,     and you're trying to convince people     that itchy hair is a real thing.\\
324 -  It is a real thing.\\
325 -  It happens to be a side effect of our cholesterol drug.\\
326 -  I'm just saying that my research     may actually change the world forever.\\
327 -  I hope it does.\\
328 -  'Cause I'm gonna see that world from a yacht so big,     you can land a helicopter on it.\\
329 -  (drink pouring)\\
330 -  Physics is all we're cut out for.\\
331 -  I mean, if we weren't physicists, w-what would we be?\\
332 -  I don't know.\\
333 - Popular?\\
334 - (chuckles)\\
335 -  Mm-hmm.\\
336 -  It's fine.\\
337 - I don't need to be a theoretical physicist.\\
338 -  There's lots of things I could use this brain for.\\
339 -  I could be an accountant for the mob.\\
340 -  I could guess people's weight at the fair.\\
341 -  Okay.\\
342 - This is getting silly.\\
343 -  Is it?\\
344 - 	.\\
345 -  Okay.\\
346 -  That is enough.\\
347 -  Your lives are not wasted.\\
348 -  Your careers are not at a dead end.\\
349 -  You just hit a rough patch.\\
350 -  Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,     you need to get up and get inspired.\\
351 -  How?\\
352 -  I don't know.\\
353 - You know, when I'm feeling down,     I go for a run, which is exactly why I'm not     pounds, genius!\\
354 -  I know where we need to go.\\
355 -  Mm.\\
356 - Are we running there?\\
357 - Because watching     drunk Sheldon run would be the highlight of my life.\\
358 -  WOLOWITZ: We're going to see     Richard Feynman.\\
359 -  Penny, Richard Feynman is an iconic phys...\\
360 -  I know who he is.\\
361 - Leonard dressed as him     for Halloween last year.\\
362 -  PENNY: I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.\\
363 -  Yep.\\
364 - Most people don't know he's actually buried right here     in Altadena.\\
365 -  I'm sure they keep a lid on that to avoid traffic jams.\\
366 -  Well.\\
367 - (chuckles)\\
368 -  Here he is.\\
369 -  Oh, wow.\\
370 - He's buried with his wife.\\
371 -  We get it.\\
372 - A lady loved you.\\
373 -  Quit bragging.\\
374 -  Feynman was so cool.\\
375 -  When I was a kid, I'd put on some headphones     and crank up one of his lectures and just...\\
376 -  jam out to knowledge.\\
377 -  This guy knew how to live.\\
378 -  He taught himself musical instruments.\\
379 -  He studied Portuguese.\\
380 -  Just to give a speech in Brazil.\\
381 -  The only part of me that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.\\
382 -  Okay.\\
383 -  He did so much.\\
384 -  And here we are, stuck and letting him down.\\
385 -  You know, Feynman used to say he didn't do physics     for the glory or the awards, but just for the fun of it.\\
386 -  He was right.\\
387 -  Physics is only dead when we stop being excited about it.\\
388 -  Even beyond the grave, he's imparting wisdom.\\
389 -  Um, I'm the one who remembered it.\\
390 -  Give me the bottle.\\
391 -  I mean, it might be a little corny, but I say     we pour one out for all the science homies     who came before us.\\
392 -  I love that.\\
393 - (Wolowitz chuckles)\\
394 -  Mm-hmm.\\
395 -  (chuckles softly)\\
396 -  (gags)\\
397 - Here comes some more.\\
398 -  (Sheldon retching)\\
399 -  Ah, we got to see him run.\\
400 -  (knocks on door)\\
401 - Oh, hi, you wanted to see me?\\
402 -  Yes.\\
403 - I wanted to talk to you about the e-mail     you sent me last night.\\
404 -  I sent you an e-mail?\\
405 -  You bet you did.\\
406 -  "Hello.\\
407 -  Shalom and aloha from the grave of Richard Feynman."     (groans): Oh, it's coming back to me.\\
408 -  "Please accept the following retraction:     "I know I said physics is dead,     "but it is the opposite of dead.\\
409 -  "If anything,     "it is undead, like a zombie.\\
410 -  "Speaking of which,     "if Richard Feynman came back as a zombie,     I would totally let him bite me."     Any chance that's the end?\\
411 -  "I got bit by a squirrel once.\\
412 -  "I had to get rabies shots.\\
413 -  "I cried so much,     "my mother said 'don't be a baby.'     "In conclusion,     "physics is great.\\
414 -  "Squirrels suck, and someday,     "I'm gonna put my mom in a cheap nursing home.\\
415 -  "Yours truly,     XOXO, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."     I-I can explain.\\
416 - I...\\
417 -  "P.S.\\
418 -  "Can you come pick us up?\\
419 -  "The Uber driver won't open the door     because Sheldon is covered in blue vomit."
\subsection {Episode 03: The Relaxation Integration}
1 - Hmm.\\
2 - Some news of our wedding.\\
3 - I have sent you all   a "save the date" e-mail.\\
4 - Oh, exciting.\\
5 - You guys picked a date?\\
6 - Better.\\
7 - I picked    dates.\\
8 - And I need you   to save them all until we narrow it down.\\
9 - I thought we agreed on June   .\\
10 - That's the day after Flag Day.\\
11 - Everyone'll be partied out.\\
12 - It's a date-- just pick one.\\
13 - It's not just a date-- it's a textbook optimization problem.\\
14 - There is a perfect date-- just like there's    a perfect room temperature and a perfect dessert.\\
15 - Mm.\\
16 - There's no perfect dessert.\\
17 - Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur    with chocolate frosting, a scoop of vanilla ice cream    on the side, not touching.\\
18 - You'll see.\\
19 - You'll have it at our wedding.\\
20 - You wanna bet?\\
21 - SHELDON: You give me    enough time, I can do the same thing    with a wedding date-- it needs to be on the weekend,    uh, not near any of your birthdays,    or the weekend of Comic Con.\\
22 - Ooh, you could get married at Comic Con.\\
23 - AMY and PENNY and BERNADETTE: No!\\
24 - We just need a weekend date    that's completely boring and uneventful.\\
25 - Too bad you didn't get your ducks in a row,    'cause tonight would have been perfect.\\
26 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
27 - Wait!\\
28 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      (low whooshing)\\
29 - Good morning.\\
30 - Good morning.\\
31 - I know today is Apple Jacks day, but...\\
32 - we're all out.\\
33 - That's fine.\\
34 - I'll have anything.\\
35 - Really?\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - You know...\\
38 - whatev.\\
39 - "Whatev"?\\
40 - I like this side of you.\\
41 - You know what I like?\\
42 - Smooth jazz.\\
43 - (playing Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good")\\
44 -      (singing melody to "Feels So Good")\\
45 - (getting quieter):  Da, da, da-da...     (loudly):  Da, da-da-da      Da, da, da...     Hey, just a reminder--    I'm going out for drinks after work.\\
46 - Oh.\\
47 - Great.\\
48 - Just a reminder-- you're pregnant.\\
49 - I'm not drinking, just taking a new coworker out.\\
50 - Oh.\\
51 - Just a reminder-- you're married.\\
52 - Female coworker.\\
53 - She's new in town, and I want to make her feel welcome.\\
54 - And let her know the office is full of liars    before everyone tells her I'm mean.\\
55 - Is she single?\\
56 - I'm not setting her up with Raj.\\
57 - What about Stuart?\\
58 - Are you listening?\\
59 - I want her to think I'm not mean.\\
60 - Okay.\\
61 - Well, it's just...\\
62 - we have two single friends.\\
63 - Howie, I just met this woman.\\
64 - Why don't I wait a little and get to know her?\\
65 - Maybe I won't like her, and then I'd be happy    to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.\\
66 - (whispers): That's all I ask.\\
67 - So, you guys lived with Sheldon for a long time...\\
68 - Long time.\\
69 - So very long.\\
70 - By the way, congratulations again on your engagement.\\
71 - Yeah.\\
72 - You got a good one.\\
73 - Thanks.\\
74 - So, it's strange,    Sheldon was talking in his sleep last night,    and he seemed like a totally different person.\\
75 - He was relaxed and...\\
76 - loose and calm.\\
77 - Well, Sheldon's a complicated man.\\
78 - He said "whatev."    Give him a brain scan-- that might be a tumor.\\
79 - Well, I think the wedding planning    is really stressful for him, and that can trigger sleep talking.\\
80 - Well, maybe this is a part of Sheldon's personality    he's been repressing.\\
81 - I mean, I think we dream about things    we wish we could be in real life.\\
82 -  Really?\\
83 - What do you dream about?\\
84 -  Oh.\\
85 - Uh...\\
86 - being the wife of Leonard.\\
87 -  Mostly that.\\
88 -  I choose to believe you.\\
89 -  Well, as much as we've studied the brain, there's still a lot     we don't know about dreams and their function.\\
90 -  You know, even psychologists are divided on it.\\
91 -  Mm, it's true-- Freud thought dreams were about s*x,     Adler thought they were about dominance...\\
92 -  Then again,     mine are just about being married to this little guy.\\
93 -  Well, now it's just edging into mockery.\\
94 -  Well, moving to a new city was a little scary,     but the job seems great.\\
95 -  Everyone's really nice.\\
96 -  Oh, they are.\\
97 - Super nice.\\
98 -  I mean, only one them took you out tonight--     but it's not a competition.\\
99 -  Thanks again.\\
100 -  You know, we could have gone somewhere     more pregnancy-friendly.\\
101 -  Oh, it's okay.\\
102 - One of the great things     about being pregnant is drinking cranberry juice     out of a wineglass and watching people freak out.\\
103 -  Bernie!\\
104 -  Oh, damn.\\
105 -  Hey!\\
106 - What are the odds?\\
107 -  Yeah, seren-frickin'-dipity.\\
108 -  Hello.\\
109 -  - Rajesh.\\
110 - - Stuart.\\
111 -  Hi.\\
112 - Ruchi.\\
113 -  Ruchi is my coworker.\\
114 -  But that was probably in your briefing packet.\\
115 -  (door opens)\\
116 -  Hi.\\
117 -  Hello.\\
118 -  What's wrong?\\
119 -  Well, I found the perfect wedding date.\\
120 -  - That's terrific!\\
121 - - No, it's not.\\
122 -  It was May   ,     .\\
123 -  We would have had a lovely wedding.\\
124 -  And our honeymoon would have coincided     with the first appearance of the Hale-Bopp comet.\\
125 -  Sheldon, you were   .\\
126 -  And in Texas-- no one would have batted an eye.\\
127 -  Oh, wait, it's no good.\\
128 -  That's the day that Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor Who, died.\\
129 -  And it's in the past.\\
130 -  Hey-hey, I said it's no good-- just let it go.\\
131 -  Sheldon...\\
132 -  I appreciate you trying to make this wedding perfect,     but it's making you miserable.\\
133 -  No, the wedding isn't making me miserable,     the calendar is.\\
134 -  Why can't there just be one week each month     for famous people to die?\\
135 -  Well, they've already arranged to die in threes--     what more do you want from them?\\
136 -  This is so frustrating.\\
137 - Why can't I find a perfect date?\\
138 -  I found the perfect way to say hi to cowboys.\\
139 - (clicks tongue)\\
140 -  I'm just saying maybe there's a part of you deep down that...\\
141 -  just wants to relax a little, you know?\\
142 -  Kick back.\\
143 -  Say, "Whatev."     Whatev?\\
144 -  I'm sorry, you're really not gonna finish that word?\\
145 -  I-I'm just trying to make a point...\\
146 -  Finish the word, Amy.\\
147 -  Fine.\\
148 - Er.\\
149 -  Er, er, er.\\
150 -  Thank you.\\
151 -  Only now you owe me three more whatevs.\\
152 -  Oh, you were born in Trivandrum.\\
153 -  Have you ever been to the Kuthira Malika Palace?\\
154 -  No, I haven't.\\
155 -  Me, either.\\
156 - What a small world.\\
157 -  I've also never been there.\\
158 -  I've never been lots of places.\\
159 -  Go on, quiz me.\\
160 -  I'm sorry, we're being rude talking about India.\\
161 -  Oh, yeah, you know, if you and Bernadette     want to talk about America, that's cool with us.\\
162 -  Here, let me get you started.\\
163 -  (American accent): Hamburgers.\\
164 - Am I right?\\
165 -  So, what do you guys do?\\
166 -  Well, I am an astrophysicist,     so if you ever go out at night and look up at the stars,     that's kind of my office.\\
167 -  He sells comic books to children.\\
168 -  STUART: Actually,     I own my own store.\\
169 - Uh, i-if you'd like     to check it out sometime, I'm running a new promotion--     buy anything, get taken out for a reasonably priced dinner.\\
170 -  Yeah, yeah, Stuart's struggling financially.\\
171 -  But he doesn't let that get him down.\\
172 -  He believes in himself.\\
173 -  Even though the whole world has made it clear     he should not.\\
174 -  Thank you.\\
175 -  A-And, you know, Raj, I think it's great     that you no longer live off your parents like a spoiled child.\\
176 -  You live over someone's garage like a...\\
177 -  failed adult.\\
178 -  Yeah, well, you live with her.\\
179 -  Oh, it's not like that.\\
180 -  He rents a room from me and my husband.\\
181 -  Who, by the way, is no prize, either.\\
182 -  Oh, I don't care.\\
183 -  You know me-- I just go with the flow.\\
184 -  Beach, public pool...\\
185 -  They both sound awesome.\\
186 -  SHELDON (recorded): On second thought, beach.\\
187 -  I'd like to befriend a seagull.\\
188 -  That is crazy.\\
189 -  Yeah.\\
190 - Will you e-mail that to me?\\
191 -  Have you played this for him?\\
192 -  No.\\
193 - I'm worried he'll say I violated his privacy.\\
194 -  Listen how happy he sounds.\\
195 -  I'm up for anything,     as long as I'm with you.\\
196 -  - What are you listening to?\\
197 - - Nothing.\\
198 -  Oh, come on, I want to hear.\\
199 -  We don't need GPS.\\
200 -  Let's just see where the road takes us.\\
201 -  I see why you turned it off.\\
202 -  That guy sounds like an idiot.\\
203 -  Honey, that's you.\\
204 -  Don't be silly.\\
205 - My voice is deep and sonorous.\\
206 -  Like a Caucasian James Earl Jones.\\
207 -  "Luke, I am your father." See?\\
208 -  It is you.\\
209 -  I recorded you in your sleep.\\
210 -  Oh, look-- a hitchhiker.\\
211 -  I bet he has some interesting stories.\\
212 -  That's me?\\
213 -  It's you.\\
214 -  So you spied on me in my sleep?\\
215 -  Sheldon, I'm sorry.\\
216 -  You've been doing this every night.\\
217 -  I couldn't help but wonder if it meant something.\\
218 -  Well, it doesn't.\\
219 -  Are you sure?\\
220 -  I mean, the prefrontal cortex regulates impulse control.\\
221 -  So it's plausible     that when we're asleep, aspects of our personality     that we repress might come out.\\
222 -  Don't try to put science lipstick on your New Age pig!\\
223 -  And for the record,     you make noises when you sleep, and I've never accused you     of repressing your inner chainsaw.\\
224 -  If you want me to object at your wedding,     just give me one of these.\\
225 -  This picture of Galactus eating a planet looks like     my preggo wife destroying a coffee cake.\\
226 -  (laughing): Oh, yeah, I see it.\\
227 -  I'm just saying, you should bow out.\\
228 -  Why should I bow out?\\
229 -  Uh, because we all know how this is gonna end.\\
230 -  That's what my doctor said, too, but I'm still here.\\
231 -  Okay, look, I think that she and I have more in common.\\
232 -  Because you're Indian?\\
233 -  So just 'cause she's brown, you get to date her?\\
234 -  Yes!\\
235 -  And the next time we meet a woman     who's pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.\\
236 -  Howard, Bernadette was there last night.\\
237 -  Did she say anything when she got home?\\
238 -  Yeah, she said, "Why'd you tell those idiots where I was?\\
239 -  Thanks a lot."     Okay, how about we flip a coin?\\
240 -  Look, hang on.\\
241 -  Doesn't this girl get a word in all of this?\\
242 -  And isn't that word "no"?\\
243 -  Ruchi said she wanted to hang out with both of us.\\
244 -  Why don't we just do that?\\
245 -  Oh, fine.\\
246 - Let's hang out as friends and see what happens.\\
247 -  Yeah, and if something grows out of it, just worry about it then.\\
248 -  Also what my doctor said.\\
249 -  Hey, this isn't your laundry night.\\
250 -  I know.\\
251 - Laundry on a Wednesday.\\
252 -  It's the madness my life has become.\\
253 -  Why is this sleep-talking thing bothering you anyway?\\
254 -  It's simple.\\
255 -  I don't like the idea     that my mind might be keeping an entire personality from me.\\
256 -  Dr.\\
257 - Jekyll's other personality was Mr.\\
258 - Hyde.\\
259 -  Mr. Hyde.\\
260 -  Didn't have a postgraduate degree.\\
261 -  Is it possible that you're stressed     because you're scared about getting married?\\
262 -  I mean, it is a big change,     and you're not good with little changes.\\
263 -  Well, that's nonsense.\\
264 -  You name one little change I was upset with.\\
265 -  Uh, when they changed the green Skittle from lime to apple.\\
266 -  That is not the rainbow I grew up tasting.\\
267 -  All right, fine.\\
268 - Let's start over.\\
269 -  Is it possible     that the sleep-talking is a part of your brain     that's telling you everything's gonna be okay     and you just need to relax a little?\\
270 -  So you're proposing that the self is an illusion,     and that we actually have multiple centers     of consciousness that are communicating with one another?\\
271 -  In laymen's terms, yeah.\\
272 -  Huh.\\
273 - Interesting.\\
274 -  So you don't believe there's a Cartesian self     that underlies the flux of experience?\\
275 -  Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.\\
276 -  Okay.\\
277 - Well, assuming you're right,     what would you suggest I do?\\
278 -  Well, I would start with something small,     see if it makes your life any better.\\
279 -  Um, you can learn to meditate, take a yoga class.\\
280 -  Oh.\\
281 - You know, I have always been intrigued by flip-flops.\\
282 -  The official footwear of the laid-back fellow.\\
283 -  - Okay, sure.\\
284 - - Of course if my feet     are gonna be exposed, I'll need to update my tetanus booster.\\
285 -  Oh, yeah.\\
286 - Makes sense.\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 - And while I'm there,     I may as well get a flu shot and a mole check.\\
289 -  Sure.\\
290 -  You know, I've never had a mole check.\\
291 -  Ooh!\\
292 -  Well, it's been nice knowing you.\\
293 -  Here you go.\\
294 -  Thanks.\\
295 - (chuckles)\\
296 -  It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it.\\
297 - He seemed fun.\\
298 -  Oh, yeah, he is.\\
299 - I love him dearly, yeah.\\
300 -  Not to say that I don't worry about him.\\
301 -  What's to worry about?\\
302 -  You know what?\\
303 -  I'm talking out of school.\\
304 -  Speaking of which, he's allowed to live near them now.\\
305 -  Hey, guys.\\
306 -  - Oh, great, Stuart.\\
307 - You're here.\\
308 - - Yeah, Stuart.\\
309 -  Yeah, I did...\\
310 - I didn't think you were gonna make it.\\
311 -  Mm.\\
312 - I believe that.\\
313 -  (ringtone playing)\\
314 -  Sorry, guys.\\
315 - It's work.\\
316 - I've got to take it.\\
317 -  Oh.\\
318 -  I'm so glad you made it, Stuart.\\
319 -  Oh, yeah, so glad.\\
320 -  I can't believe you went behind my back!\\
321 -  Which clearly means I want this more!\\
322 -  You want to play a game of "who's more desperate" with me?\\
323 -  'Cause you're in the big leagues now, Bucko.\\
324 -  L-Look, Ruchi and I are really hitting it off.\\
325 -  Please let me just have this one!\\
326 -  I'm not going anywhere.\\
327 -  I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.\\
328 -  Sorry.\\
329 -  So what's going on?\\
330 -  Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story     about the fungus he can't get rid of.\\
331 -  Raj didn't tell me about tonight     so he could be alone with you.\\
332 -  Really?\\
333 -  That's a little weird.\\
334 -  Just a little?\\
335 - Because I can work with that.\\
336 -  Look, guys, I'm not interested in dating anyone right now.\\
337 -  I'm just looking to make some friends.\\
338 -  Yeah, I totally understand.\\
339 -  But if you were gonna date someone,     would it be me or Stuart?\\
340 -  I think I'm gonna go.\\
341 -  Uh, uh, uh, uh, Ruchi, I'm sorry.\\
342 -  If you still want to hang out as friends, I'd like that.\\
343 -  Thanks, Stuart.\\
344 - I'd like that, too.\\
345 -  And the fungus is under the toenail.\\
346 -  Hello.\\
347 -  Hey.\\
348 -  So, um, I, uh...\\
349 -  I got flip-flops.\\
350 -  Good for you.\\
351 -  Oh, my God, what happened?!\\
352 -  After I got the flip-flops,     I realized that the tops of my feet were exposed, so, um,     I-I put on some sunscreen,     which caused my feet to become slippery.\\
353 -  And predictably, one of them fell off     and went down a sewer grate.\\
354 -  Now, normally, I would have walked away,     but this is a new, laid-back me, so,     instead of getting upset, I just reached down to grab it.\\
355 -  That's when I touched something furry...     ...\\
356 - which I'm telling myself was a damp toupee.\\
357 -  When the toupee licked my hand...     ...\\
358 - I screamed and hopped down the street     on my remaining flip-flop.\\
359 -  Can I just ask...?\\
360 -  No, this is a long story.\\
361 -  Why don't we please save your questions till the end?\\
362 -  So, I-I finally came upon a bus bench     where I sat and removed one of my shirts     and, uh, fashioned it into a makeshift shoe.\\
363 -  Not a waterproof shoe.\\
364 -  That is relevant to the next part of my story.\\
365 -  The ankle-deep puddle of warm apple juice.\\
366 -  Apple juice?\\
367 -  Maybe, maybe not.\\
368 -  I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.\\
369 -  What happened to your other flip-flop?\\
370 -  Oh, well, that involves     what I am telling myself was a...\\
371 - melted candy bar.\\
372 -  Okay.\\
373 - I-I'm sorry.\\
374 -  Is there anything I can do to help?\\
375 -  Yes.\\
376 - I want you to be in charge of our wedding.\\
377 -  Just you tell me where and when,     and I will show up with a boutonniere     and close-toed shoes and a...\\
378 -  a Star Trek uniform underneath my tuxedo.\\
379 -  That last part is non-negotiable.\\
380 -  Are you sure that's what you want?\\
381 -  As sure as I'm about to go bathe in Purell.\\
382 -  I love you.\\
383 - I love you, too.\\
384 -  You know, ever since I was a young girl,     I-I've dreamed of a June wedding,     maybe on a cliff overlooking the ocean at sunset.\\
385 -  Sure.\\
386 -  Sounds wonderful.\\
387 -  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go clean up.\\
388 -  Outdoor wedding.\\
389 -  I know what I'll be using that cliff for.\\
390 -  I call this meeting of the Council of Sheldons to order.\\
391 -  Let's take roll.\\
392 -  Science Sheldon?\\
393 -  Present.\\
394 -  Texas Sheldon?\\
395 -  Howdy.\\
396 -  Fanboy Sheldon?\\
397 -  Greetings.\\
398 -  Germaphobe Sheldon?\\
399 -  Say it, don't spray it.\\
400 -  Where's Jock Sheldon?\\
401 -  Not the time, Humorous Sheldon!\\
402 -  Okay, new business.\\
403 -  Do we grant Laid-Back Sheldon a seat on the council?\\
404 -  Hey, whatever you guys want.\\
405 -  I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan.\\
406 -  - Negative.\\
407 - - Heck, no!\\
408 -  I don't feel well.\\
409 -  (horn honks)\\
410 -  Can we kick him out, too?
\subsection {Episode 04: The Explosion Implosion}
1 - It feels like it wasn't that long ago   we were here doing this for Halley.\\
2 - 'Cause it wasn't.\\
3 - Which reminds me, before we leave,   let's get you a vasectomy.\\
4 - Oh, that's sweet, but today is all about you.\\
5 - So, you two ready to find out the s*x of this baby?\\
6 - Yeah.\\
7 - Absolutely.\\
8 - Is Halley hoping    for a little brother or a little sister?\\
9 - Well, she's nine months old,    so unless it jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care.\\
10 - And how about you two?\\
11 - You know, for the first one, we really wanted a girl,    but this time around, we don't have a preference.\\
12 - Yeah.\\
13 - Boy, girl, as long as it's healthy.\\
14 - Well, it's a boy.\\
15 -  (heartbeat pulsing)\\
16 -  Oh.\\
17 - Oh.\\
18 - Come on, you can't really be disappointed.\\
19 - Hey, I barely know how to be a man myself.\\
20 - Now I have to teach someone?\\
21 - As the saying goes, “Those who can't do, teach”"    Don't you want a little version of Howard?\\
22 - I already have a little version of Howard.\\
23 - Now I'm having a son?\\
24 - I'll have to teach him how to play sports,    and-and watch sports    and-and-and-and-and-and...\\
25 - He just ran out of man things.\\
26 - He's in trouble.\\
27 - It's okay.\\
28 - We're all here to help.\\
29 - Yes.\\
30 - And this baby will have plenty of manly role models.\\
31 - Now, I'm certain that whatever Bernadette can't teach him,    Penny can.\\
32 - Uh, she can pee into a bottle.\\
33 - Mm-hmm.\\
34 - Anything with a neck wider than a nickel.\\
35 - Howie, there's a lot of amazing things you can teach a son.\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - You do always know how to pick just the right antacid.\\
38 - I don't know if I can teach that.\\
39 - It's just something I was born with.\\
40 - Come on.\\
41 - You can build things.\\
42 - You were an astronaut.\\
43 - That's true.\\
44 - You know, as a kid, I used to make model rockets.\\
45 - That'd be pretty cool to do with a son.\\
46 - Model rockets.\\
47 - Finally, something interesting.\\
48 - What is your preferred mode of recovery?\\
49 - Sheldon, we're helping our friends.\\
50 - And we got to model rockets, yeah?\\
51 - It was a tedious road, but well worth the effort.\\
52 - - So, have you thought of any names?\\
53 - - Amy.\\
54 - We finally got to model rockets.\\
55 - Why are you turning back?\\
56 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
57 - Wait!\\
58 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Hey, where are you going?\\
59 - Back to the dry cleaner.\\
60 - Look at this.\\
61 - They didn't get the stain out of my Starfleet uniform.\\
62 - Well, if you didn't make me wear the green body paint in bed,    you wouldn't have to get it dry-cleaned so much.\\
63 - Nah, it's worth it.\\
64 -  (Skype ringtone playing)\\
65 -  Hey, wait, it's your mom.\\
66 - Oh, too bad.\\
67 - She just missed me!\\
68 - Hey, Beverly.\\
69 - Oh, hello, Penny.\\
70 - Uh, Leonard just left.\\
71 - He's gonna be so upset he missed your call.\\
72 - Why?\\
73 - Because he...\\
74 - Yeah, I don't know.\\
75 - How are you?\\
76 - Did you mean personally or professionally?\\
77 - Um, personally?\\
78 - Like, what'd you do last night?\\
79 - I had Cuban food at the home of a man    with whom I shared unsatisfying intercourse.\\
80 - Wow.\\
81 - Okay.\\
82 - And to anticipate your next questions,    roasted pork and sideways missionary.\\
83 - Sure.\\
84 - Sure.\\
85 - 'Cause you were full.\\
86 - I haven't looked at all this stuff in years.\\
87 - Had it.\\
88 - Had it.\\
89 - Burnt down my garage with it.\\
90 - I had three model rockets as a kid,    and that was the largest space program in India.\\
91 - You have a replica Saturn V?\\
92 - Yeah.\\
93 - My dad bought it before he, you know,    abandoned our family.\\
94 -  Lucky duck.\\
95 -  Could never bring myself to open it without him.\\
96 - (chuckles)\\
97 -   It's silly.\\
98 -  No, it's not silly.\\
99 -  I always wanted my dad to build rockets with me,     but he wasn't interested.\\
100 -  Ah, yes, disappointing fathers.\\
101 -  Tell me about it.\\
102 -  I remember for my   th birthday, my dad bought me a Mercedes.\\
103 -  Like, a little one, like a starter Mercedes.\\
104 -  He had barely handed me the keys     before he had to rush back to work.\\
105 -  I didn't see him again till, like, pretty late that night.\\
106 -  Anyway....\\
107 - as angry as I was with him leaving,     building this stuff is probably what led me     to become an engineer.\\
108 -  I suppose, in his own way,     my dad also encouraged me to pursue science.\\
109 -  I mean, he is the one that taught me     that flatulence is combustible.\\
110 -  And also, polyester gym shorts don't burn.\\
111 -  They melt.\\
112 -  Yeah, I guess I'm an astrophysicist because,     as a kid, I said I like to look at the stars,     so my dad sent me to Hawaii to visit the Keck telescope.\\
113 -  Screw you.\\
114 - My pain is real.\\
115 -  You know what?\\
116 - Forget the past.\\
117 -  What do you say you and me build this rocket?\\
118 -  That sounds like it could be     a real bonding experience for us.\\
119 -  Right?\\
120 -  Oh, I see.\\
121 -  Oh, you think that's a positive.\\
122 -  So, you don't want to hang out with Sheldon and Howard?\\
123 -  No, they were bonding over their sad childhoods,     and my stupid parents were always there for me.\\
124 -  What's all this?\\
125 -  I'm just boxing up all the clothes Halley's outgrown.\\
126 -  Guess we won't need them anymore.\\
127 -  Oh, well, slow down.\\
128 -  I'm sure there's some you could reuse for a boy.\\
129 -  “Daddy's little girl”?\\
130 -  Okay, well, what if we, uh, change it to say,     “Daddy's little girl magnet”?\\
131 -  Boom!\\
132 - Boy shirt.\\
133 -  What about this?\\
134 -  Uh, okay.\\
135 -  Uh, pull off the skirt, slap a lightning bolt on the front,     and you got baby Flash.\\
136 -  Ooh.\\
137 -  Stick a long sleeve under it.\\
138 -  Boom!\\
139 - Baby Sheldon.\\
140 -  Wow, you're really good at this.\\
141 -  Oh, please.\\
142 -  This isn't my first time     turning girl clothes into boy clothes.\\
143 -  Why?\\
144 - You got your sister's hand-me-downs?\\
145 -  Yeah, that.\\
146 -  Oh.\\
147 - I should've brought peanuts.\\
148 -  You can't eat peanuts.\\
149 - You're allergic.\\
150 -  If you die, who's going to drive me home?\\
151 -  I'm not gonna eat them.\\
152 -  It's a thing they do at JPL.\\
153 -  When the Ranger mission finally had a successful launch,     there were peanuts in the room.\\
154 -  Ever since then, they have them at every launch.\\
155 -  That sounds like a silly superstition.\\
156 -  It's more of a tradition.\\
157 -  Oh!\\
158 - I do love a tradition.\\
159 -  Could you pull over at the next peanut store?\\
160 -  I don't think that's a real thing.\\
161 -  Oh, don't be pedantic.\\
162 -  Any nut store will do.\\
163 -  I-I don't think we can get peanuts out here.\\
164 -  Ah, well, then this whole day's ruined.\\
165 -  Now that I think about it, maybe it is more of a superstition.\\
166 -  Whew!\\
167 - That was close.\\
168 -   (ringtone playing)\\
169 -   Oh, uh, hey, Beverly, you called my phone, not Leonard's.\\
170 -  Actually, I was hoping to speak with you.\\
171 -  Is this a good time?\\
172 -  Uh, that depends.\\
173 -  What time is it where you are?\\
174 -  Uh, just after  :  .\\
175 -   (clears throat)\\
176 - Yeah, that counts.\\
177 -  What's up?\\
178 -  Well, I enjoyed our conversation the other day,     and I was hoping to continue it.\\
179 -  Really?\\
180 -  Uh, yes.\\
181 - You may find this surprising,     but I don't have a lot of what you would call girlfriends.\\
182 -   (exaggerated) : What?\\
183 -  Of course, there are my female colleagues,     but, uh, they're all Freudians,     so the only boy that I can dish about is my father.\\
184 -   (laughs)\\
185 -   Uh, well, you know, I'm here for you.\\
186 -  What do you want to talk about?\\
187 -  Well, last time, we focused on my life.\\
188 -  If we're going to be real girlfriends,     we should talk about you as well.\\
189 -  Well, you know, if we're gonna be     real girlfriends, we should get a third girl     we can trash behind her back.\\
190 -  Oh, so we'd be catty.\\
191 -  Oh, I like it.\\
192 -  What about Sheldon's fiancée?\\
193 -  She seems a bit dour.\\
194 -  Ooh, “dour.”     Meow.\\
195 -  All right.\\
196 -  Here we go.\\
197 -  L-minus ten, nine...\\
198 -  Wait, what are you doing?\\
199 - It's “T-minus”"     I was an astronaut.\\
200 - We used L-minus.\\
201 -  But this is a Saturn V,     and when they launched those, they said “T-minus”"     It's my rocket!\\
202 - We're doing it my way.\\
203 -  Fine.\\
204 -  I'm not saying I know why your dad left,     but I think I'm getting an idea.\\
205 -  L-minus     ten, nine, eight,     seven, six...\\
206 -  'Cause you're kind of bossy.\\
207 -  ...five, four, three, two,     one...\\
208 -  I remember them going up higher.\\
209 -  Well, that's perfect.\\
210 -  I mean, the one thing I thought I could     do with my son, I can't even do that right.\\
211 -  Well, if you want to see it again, I got it on video.\\
212 -  Looks pretty cool in slow motion.\\
213 -  Thank you for your support.\\
214 -  You're welcome.\\
215 - I was being sarcastic.\\
216 -  How dare you!\\
217 -  Sheldon, what am I gonna do?\\
218 -  I mean, what do I know about raising a boy?\\
219 -  What do you know about raising a girl?\\
220 -  Oh, my God, you're right.\\
221 -  Well, I don't know if that was sarcasm or not.\\
222 -  So, either you're welcome, or hey!\\
223 -   (phone chimes)\\
224 -   Leonard, did you really just text me from the couch     to put extra mustard on your sandwich?\\
225 -  I was worried you might not check your e-mail.\\
226 -   (phone chimes)\\
227 -   I swear to God, I will throw this out.\\
228 -  That one was not me.\\
229 -  Oh, wait, it was just your mom.\\
230 -  My mother's texting you?\\
231 -  Yeah.\\
232 - We've been talking a lot lately.\\
233 -  Why?\\
234 -  She sick of talking to the magic mirror on the wall?\\
235 -  No, I think she's lonely.\\
236 -  She's been reaching out.\\
237 -  Okay, just be careful.\\
238 -  You think you're getting close to her,     and the next thing you know, you're featured in a book     called He's Doing It On Purpose: Raising a Teenage Bed-Wetter.     No, it's not like that.\\
239 -  You know, she's been opening up about her life,     and she's actually been really supportive about mine.\\
240 -  Really?\\
241 - Yeah.\\
242 -  I've been telling her about my job,     and she said she was proud of me.\\
243 -  Well, that's great.\\
244 -  Never told me she was proud of me.\\
245 -  Even when I stayed dry for a whole month.\\
246 -  Do you not want me to be friends with your mom?\\
247 -  Well, let's be clear.\\
248 -  I-I married you to hurt her.\\
249 -  You're kind of ruining it.\\
250 -  Reason number   to feel good:     as a launch, it was bad,     but as an explosion, it was glorious.\\
251 -  Reason   :     you still have all your fingers,     and boys prefer a dad with fingers.\\
252 -  Thanks for trying,     but you're not gonna be able to cheer me up.\\
253 -  Well, how about this, then?\\
254 -  You quit your whining before I give you     something to cry about, young man.\\
255 -  What?\\
256 -  Those are comforting words my father would often say.\\
257 -  Did it help?\\
258 -  I turned out great.\\
259 -  You tell me.\\
260 -  Let's get going.\\
261 -  Are you gonna be this mopey all the way home?\\
262 -  I don't know, maybe.\\
263 -  There any chance you'd be cheered up     by an amazing trigonometry riddle?\\
264 -  Well, if you can't answer that,     there's no way you're gonna get this riddle.\\
265 -  Oh, hey, hey, what do you think?\\
266 -  Just because it's a boy, I don't think you need to     put a picture of genitals on his shirt.\\
267 -  But that's a baseball bat with two little baseballs.\\
268 -  Okay, and now I see it.\\
269 -  So, you know, I understand why     Howard is nervous about having a son,     but are you really upset about it?\\
270 -  No, I'm fine.\\
271 -  It's just, I grew up with a bunch of brothers,     so I thought it'd be nice for Halley to have a sister.\\
272 -  Is that wrong?\\
273 -  Of course it's wrong.\\
274 -  You don't know what this little boy's gonna be like.\\
275 -  Maybe he'll be rough and tumble,     or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive,     or maybe he'll be all those things, like me.\\
276 -  You're rough and tumble?\\
277 -  You bet I am, bitch.\\
278 -  But I'm also sensitive and regret saying that.\\
279 -   (knock on door)\\
280 -   Hey.\\
281 - Hello.\\
282 -  You got a sec?\\
283 -  Sure.\\
284 - What's up?\\
285 -  Penny's been talking to my mother     like they're best friends, and it's kind of freaking me out.\\
286 -  Okay...\\
287 -  I'm pretty sure they're not best friends.\\
288 -  'Cause you can only have one best friend.\\
289 -  And Penny has that, and  (clicks tongue)\\
290 - it's me.\\
291 -  Oh, really?\\
292 - Is she FaceTiming with you right now?\\
293 -  Because she's FaceTiming with my mom, and believe me,     that is not a face you want to spend time with.\\
294 -  Hmm.\\
295 - Well, I have been pretty busy lately.\\
296 -  Maybe I've been neglecting our friendship.\\
297 -  Penny knows I have a complicated relationship     with my mother; it's like she doesn't even care.\\
298 -  And with everything going on at the lab     and planning the wedding,     I just, I have so little free time.\\
299 -  Penny doesn't know how manipulative my mother can be.\\
300 -  Did you know there's such a thing as     reverse, reverse, reverse psychology?\\
301 -  Because...\\
302 - there is.\\
303 -  I mean, she must feel so abandoned.\\
304 -  She's used to me being there all the time,     but now I have my own life,     and she's just gonna have to accept it.\\
305 -  And why is my mom proud of Penny and not me?\\
306 -  I mean, the real question is: why is Penny so afraid of me     growing as a person?\\
307 -  I'm good at stuff, too!\\
308 -  I deserve my own life!\\
309 -  Okay, well, thanks.\\
310 -  Good talk.\\
311 -  You know, studies have shown     that people distracted by emotional issues     are poor drivers.\\
312 -  What about people distracted by irritating passengers?\\
313 -  That would be hard to test,     because irritating is a subjective quality.\\
314 -  Strongly disagree.\\
315 -  Can I drive?\\
316 -  No.\\
317 - (chuckles)\\
318 -   You can't drive.\\
319 -  You don't even have a license.\\
320 -  Actually, I do.\\
321 -  Really?\\
322 - Since when?\\
323 -  Three years ago.\\
324 -  I went on a bit of a license kick.\\
325 -  I'm also a commercial fisherman.\\
326 -  Then why don't you ever drive yourself?\\
327 -  Honestly, I barely passed my test.\\
328 -  And the one time I drove on my own,     I made a U-turn, got dizzy, threw up and walked home.\\
329 -  You really want to drive?\\
330 -  It seems like the perfect time.\\
331 -  The roads are straight, there's no one around,     and you don't seem to care if you live or die.\\
332 -  Live, Sheldon.\\
333 - I want to live.\\
334 -  That makes things a little trickier,     but I'll do my best.\\
335 -   (line ringing)\\
336 -   BEVERLY:  Hi, Pen...\\
337 -  Oh, hello, Leonard.\\
338 -  Hello, Mother.\\
339 - How are you?\\
340 -  Fine.\\
341 - And you?\\
342 - I'm great.\\
343 -  Well, it's been lovely catching up.\\
344 -  Wait.\\
345 - Hang on.\\
346 - We need to talk.\\
347 -  Oh, brother.\\
348 -  I want to know, why aren't you proud of me?\\
349 -  Well, isn't the real question,     “Why aren't you proud of yourself?”     No, that is a question-- and I ask it a lot--     but let's stick with the one I asked you.\\
350 -  But why do you think I'm not proud of you?\\
351 -  Because you never say it.\\
352 -  But two days into chatting with Penny,     and you can't stop telling her how great she is.\\
353 -  She is great.\\
354 -  Honestly, of all of my children's spouses,     she's the one that I'm most impressed by.\\
355 -  Seriously?\\
356 -  Yes.\\
357 -  She's confident, she's thoughtful,     and she never complained about you once.\\
358 -  I know what kind of strength that takes.\\
359 -  So, Penny's your favorite?\\
360 -  I suppose she is.\\
361 -  You married well, Leonard, and for that I am proud of you.\\
362 -  I don't...\\
363 - I don't...\\
364 - I don't know what to say.\\
365 -  I'm also proud of how hard you're trying not to cry.\\
366 -   (choked up) : Thank you.\\
367 -  Would you like to hang up now?\\
368 -  Yeah, here it comes.\\
369 -  Your hands are at   :   and  :  .\\
370 -  Good.\\
371 - Steady on the gas.\\
372 -  Okay.\\
373 -  Now you're gonna want to slowly switch lanes.\\
374 -  Why?\\
375 -  Because there are only two,     and you're not in either of them.\\
376 -  Attaboy.\\
377 - Well done!\\
378 -  Thank you.\\
379 -  The last time I drove, I was terrified,     but this is fun.\\
380 -  You're doing great.\\
381 -  You're a good teacher.\\
382 -  Your son is going to be lucky to have you as a father.\\
383 -  Thanks.\\
384 -  Do you think I could try going a little faster?\\
385 -  Go for it, champ.\\
386 -  Ow.\\
387 -  Sorry.\\
388 -  Just ease on the gas, and...\\
389 -   (engine revving)\\
390 - Oh, too much!\\
391 - Too much!\\
392 -  Why was I scared of this?\\
393 - This is exhilarating!\\
394 -  No, it's not!\\
395 - Slow down!\\
396 -  Don't tell me what to do!\\
397 - You're not my father!\\
398 -  Do you know how fast you were going?\\
399 - 	.\\
400 -  Let me see your license.\\
401 -  - Okay, here's the plan.\\
402 - - No.\\
403 -  Fine.\\
404 -  There you go.\\
405 -  You know what, you can just keep it.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Collaboration Contamination}
1 - Thanks for letting me put Halley in your room.\\
2 - Yeah, no problem.\\
3 - Oh, and, Penny, she kinda threw up on your stuffed bear.\\
4 - Oh, that's okay.\\
5 - Hey.\\
6 - Tha-That's an Ewok and it's mine.\\
7 - Yeah, which is why it's okay.\\
8 - See, he gets Ewoks in his bed.\\
9 - You've got Chewbacca; that's enough.\\
10 -  KOOTHRAPPALI:  I used to have    the stuffed raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy,    but Cinnamon licked it raw.\\
11 - There's a time and place for your randy dog stories,    and...\\
12 - it's never and nowhere.\\
13 - Yeah, no more stories about s*x,    so, Amy, that brings us to you.\\
14 - Well, at work we've been doing    some interesting research with neuroprosthetics.\\
15 -  PENNY:  Neat.\\
16 - I've been rewatching The O.C.,    so we're all leading productive lives.\\
17 - We've been working on a computer interface    that can use brain wave patterns to control robotic limbs,    but we're having a little trouble localizing    the signal from the EEG cap.\\
18 - Oh, well, have you thought about adding a phased array of sensors    for better localization?\\
19 - Actually, that never occurred to me.\\
20 - It never occurred to me    I would miss the Ewok conversation.\\
21 - Good, 'cause I just bought another one on Amazon.\\
22 - You know, I could use an engineer on this project.\\
23 - Well, now, this works out great.\\
24 - Howard's an engineer.\\
25 - I'm sure he knows someone qualified.\\
26 - She was talking about me, Sheldon.\\
27 - I'm perfectly qualified.\\
28 - Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer.\\
29 - It says so right on his coffee mug.\\
30 - Aw, you got him a mug?\\
31 - I did.\\
32 - But it's not a competition.\\
33 - Yeah, I lost that battle years ago.\\
34 - So, Howard, are you interested?\\
35 - Are you kidding?\\
36 - If I could control robot arms with my brain,    I'd be able to do so many things.\\
37 - Really?\\
38 - Because you've been controlling human arms    with your brain for years and not much has come of it.\\
39 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
40 - Wait!\\
41 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Hey, what you reading?\\
42 - A parenting book.\\
43 - Oh, my God.\\
44 - Are-are we...?\\
45 - Wha...\\
46 - No!\\
47 - You think this is how I would tell you?\\
48 - Well...\\
49 - (stammers)\\
50 -  You're sitting there with a book.\\
51 - It felt like anything was possible.\\
52 - Bernadette left it here.\\
53 - Yeah?\\
54 - Anything interesting?\\
55 - Well, I just saw a picture of a baby's head crowning,    so I hope you enjoyed s*x, because we're done with that.\\
56 - Hello.\\
57 - - Hi.\\
58 - - Hey, Sheldon, what's up?\\
59 - Well, remember how disappointed you were    when Amy started driving me to work?\\
60 - Sure, uh...\\
61 - Sometimes people smile a big smile of disappointment.\\
62 - Yeah, well, good news,    Amy had to go in early to show Howard around her lab,    so you get to drive me.\\
63 - Aw, his smile of disappointment    has turned into a frown of joy.\\
64 - It's fine, I've been driving him for years.\\
65 - What's one more day?\\
66 - Oh, and I've got a new car game we can play.\\
67 - It's called “what siren am I?”    Kill me.\\
68 - Amy, your lab is amazing.\\
69 - A C-arm fluoroscope,    a cranial ultrasound...\\
70 -  (gasps)\\
71 -  And look at that coffee maker.\\
72 - I know.\\
73 - On our expense report,    I listed it as “Eduardo,” my Colombian lab assistant.\\
74 - So this is it?\\
75 - Yes.\\
76 - We are using it to map brain wave patterns    and then converting them into electrical impulses    that can be used to control anything     from wheelchairs to robots.\\
77 -  Based on that ring on your finger,     I'd say you're pretty good at controlling robots.\\
78 -  Careful, that's my fiancé you're talking about,     and I can program him to hurt you.\\
79 -   (imitates melodic siren wailing)\\
80 -   I don't know.\\
81 - Uh...\\
82 - French police?\\
83 -  Oh.\\
84 - So close.\\
85 -  Belgian ambulance.\\
86 -  All right, you ready for your next one?\\
87 -  Just a warning, this one's a little annoying.\\
88 -   (imitates high-pitched siren)\\
89 -   Let's take a little...\\
90 - little break,     I'm getting a headache.\\
91 -  Aw, right in the middle of our fun game.\\
92 -  Yeah, weird.\\
93 -  So...\\
94 -  Howard and Amy working together--     that's interesting, huh?\\
95 -  Eh.\\
96 - It's all right, I suppose.\\
97 -  Uh, when-- usually when Amy complains about her coworkers,     I just tune her out,     but now I'll be able to join in and pound away.\\
98 -  You're not jealous of Howard, are you?\\
99 -  Of course not.\\
100 -  The only engineer I'm jealous of     is the one who blows the train whistle.\\
101 -  Ooh, that just gave me an idea for a new game,     “what whistle am I?” Train.\\
102 -  For your information, it was going to be tea kettle,     but the tea kettle was on a train,     so I'll give it to you.\\
103 -  If we add phase detection to your EEG sensors,     I'll have to rewrite most of the code.\\
104 -  Can you do that?\\
105 - Well, these hands     were made to do three things:     close-up magic, writing code,     and the dirty shadow puppet show     that got me kicked out of Hebrew school.\\
106 -  Hello.\\
107 -  Hi.\\
108 - What a nice surprise.\\
109 -  Well, I just came by to see how you two were getting along.\\
110 -   (laughs)\\
111 - Well, everything's going really great.\\
112 -  Oh, that's nice to hear.\\
113 -  I was hoping you two would enjoy working together.\\
114 -  What's with the blinking?\\
115 -   (quietly) : It's Morse code.\\
116 -  So we can talk about...     ...\\
117 - without hurting...\\
118 - 's feelings.\\
119 -  Sheldon, I don't know Morse code.\\
120 -  I do.\\
121 - And if you have something to say,     you can say it to my face.\\
122 -  Oh.\\
123 - All right.\\
124 -  I'm a little rusty.\\
125 - Could you say that again?\\
126 -  She's going to be home at “eight-ish.” Like, when is that?\\
127 -   :  ?  :  ?\\
128 -  And what kind of scientist uses “-ish”?\\
129 -  I'll give it a go.\\
130 -  My ride home with you was hellish.\\
131 -  Sheldon, honey, if you want to join us for dinner,     you're more than welcome.\\
132 -  No, thank you.\\
133 - I don't think     I'd be very good company tonight.\\
134 -  Well, then out you go.\\
135 -  Okay, what is going on?\\
136 -  Well, ever since Amy started working with Howard,     she hasn't been home.\\
137 -  Didn't that just start this morning?\\
138 -  And has she been home?\\
139 -  You know, that would frustrate me.\\
140 -  Does it frustrate you?\\
141 -  I-It does.\\
142 -  I get that.\\
143 -  You know, it's okay to feel frustrated     when things aren't going your way.\\
144 -  I suppose.\\
145 -  Ah, maybe it's not that big a deal.\\
146 -   PENNY:  No, no, no, your feelings     are valid.\\
147 -  Now, why don't you go wash up,     and we'll call you when dinner's ready.\\
148 -  Okay.\\
149 -   (door closes)\\
150 -   What did you do-- Are you a witch?\\
151 -  No, I've been reading Bernadette's parenting book.\\
152 -  It's like the answer key to the Sheldon test.\\
153 -  That's amazing.\\
154 - I know.\\
155 -  But, you know, it's only birth to five.\\
156 -  What do we do when he turns six?\\
157 -  Take him to the zoo and leave him there.\\
158 -  Hey, Bernadette.\\
159 -  Oh, hey, Raj.\\
160 -  Howard's not here.\\
161 - Oh, I know,     he's been in the lab every night this week with his work wife.\\
162 -  That's weird,     I thought his work wife was standing in my kitchen.\\
163 -  Don't be snippy.\\
164 -  I came to see how you were doing.\\
165 -  Like, uh, do you need help with anything?\\
166 -  Oh, thank you.\\
167 -  There are a few things around the house     that I've been waiting for Howard to get to.\\
168 -  The smoke alarms...\\
169 -  No, I meant emotionally.\\
170 -  How are you feeling?\\
171 -  Like you're not really here to help me.\\
172 -  Well, still snippy.\\
173 -  Everything's fine.\\
174 -  Howard's really excited about his work,     he's been in a great mood...\\
175 - I'm really proud of him.\\
176 -  And I can fit into the pants I wore in high school.\\
177 -  Come on, we don't need to lie to each other.\\
178 -  You're right.\\
179 -  I have a teething baby, I'm pregnant,     I have a proposal due tomorrow.\\
180 -  I don't have time to hear about     how much you're missing my husband.\\
181 -  Well, I think I know why he's been working so late.\\
182 -  Hi.\\
183 -  Welcome home.\\
184 -  How was work?\\
185 -  Great.\\
186 - Howard had an idea for...\\
187 -  That's enough about work.\\
188 -  Aw, you just got here.\\
189 -  You need to sit down and let me pamper you.\\
190 -   (laughs) : Oh.\\
191 - Well, that sounds nice.\\
192 -  I got you a little something to help you relax.\\
193 -  Sheldon, that is the sweetest, most...\\
194 -  What...\\
195 - what is this?\\
196 -  The notes from our quantum cognition project.\\
197 -  I thought we could     spend the evening grinding away on it.\\
198 -   (sighs)\\
199 - I just got home, I'm tired.\\
200 -  Of Howard, I know.\\
201 -  So how about you and me     make some beautiful science together?\\
202 -  Sheldon, I want to work on this with you, just not tonight.\\
203 -  What if we get up early and do it in the morning?\\
204 - I promise,     I'll be way more into it.\\
205 -  You know what?\\
206 -  There was a time that you would've been happy     to stay up and collaborate all night with me.\\
207 -  And then wake up in the morning and do it some more.\\
208 -   (sighs)\\
209 - Fine, but can we make it quick?\\
210 -  No.\\
211 -  If you're just gonna make me do all the work, then go to bed.\\
212 -  But don't be surprised if you walk out here     and catch me doing it myself.\\
213 -  Ahh, Sheldon's texting me to drive him to Bernadette's.\\
214 -  Well, what are you gonna say?\\
215 -  Well, they did just introduce the middle finger emoji.\\
216 -  If it's not for this, I don't know what it's for.\\
217 -  No, no, no.\\
218 - He'll just think that means     “Be there in a minute.”     Uh...\\
219 -  Maybe there's something in the book that will help.\\
220 -  Worth a shot.\\
221 -  Okay.\\
222 - Let's see, let's see.\\
223 -  “Biting other children”?\\
224 -  Well, sometimes, but...\\
225 - problem for another day.\\
226 -  Okay, wait, wait.\\
227 - Here we go.\\
228 -  “Let him have ownership of his choices.\\
229 -  Allow him to choose from options that are acceptable to you.”     All right, I'll give it a try.\\
230 -  “I can drive you in two hours or you can take an Uber”"     Good.\\
231 - See, now he feels like he has a choice.\\
232 -  Huh.\\
233 - (phone chimes)\\
234 -   He's gonna take an Uber.\\
235 -  Wow, it worked.\\
236 -  Unless he bites the driver, yeah.\\
237 -  And now they're working on a Saturday?\\
238 -  Can you believe them?\\
239 -  Like, is this how you envisioned your weekend?\\
240 -  No, it is not.\\
241 -  This whole thing is maddening.\\
242 -  I'm really busy.\\
243 -  I don't have time to listen to you complain.\\
244 -  Hey.\\
245 - You're complaining, too.\\
246 -  “Sheldon, why are you here?”     “Sheldon, the applesauce is for the baby.”     What do you want?\\
247 -  I just wish I could make Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling.\\
248 -  Well, maybe you could do something he likes     and make him jealous.\\
249 -  Like what?\\
250 -  Have you ever read Tom Sawyer?     No.\\
251 -  Chores.\\
252 - He likes chores.\\
253 -  Ooh.\\
254 - What kind of chores?\\
255 -  Well,     you could change the batteries in the smoke detectors.\\
256 -  That would drive him crazy.\\
257 -  That's great.\\
258 -  Oh, he'll be so mad smoke will be coming out of his ears.\\
259 -  And then the smoke detectors will detect it.\\
260 -  Wait, wait, now, hold on.\\
261 -  Why'd you ask me about Tom Sawyer?     I'm just interested in you.\\
262 -  Well, you are sweeter than your applesauce.\\
263 -  Okay, I'm gonna extend the wait time and have it poll     the A-to-D converter at the top of the loop     instead of the bottom.\\
264 -  Oh.\\
265 - That's impressive.\\
266 -  You think that's impressive, take apart that brain model.\\
267 -   (gasps)\\
268 -   Oh my God-- three of clubs.\\
269 -  That was my card!\\
270 -  How did you...?\\
271 -  I used to make it appear in my pants,     but HR said I had to stop doing that.\\
272 -  So, how much longer till we can test it?\\
273 -  Well, it needs to compile, so it's gonna be a few minutes.\\
274 -  Sounds like we've earned ourselves a break.\\
275 -  You want to hear some Neil Sedaka?\\
276 -  You know, that's your greatest magic trick,     'cause you just read my mind.\\
277 -   I love, I love, I love my calendar girl       Yeah, sweet calendar girl       I love, I love, I love my calendar girl       Each and every day of the year       January       You start the year all fine...\\
278 -  Well, well, well.\\
279 -  - Hi.\\
280 - - Hey.\\
281 -  You say you're busy as bees, yet here you are, dancing.\\
282 -  Although I suppose bees do dance,     but their dance lets other bees know where the pollen is,     and yours does not.\\
283 -  So my logic, despite that slight detour, does track.\\
284 -  We're just waiting for my code to compile.\\
285 -  What are you doing here?\\
286 - I stopped by     to see if you wanted to go to the movies with me.\\
287 -  Well, I-I'd love to,     but we're just about to test the interface.\\
288 -  It could take a while.\\
289 -  Okay, buddy, it-- it's not my place,     but Bernadette's been feeling a little abandoned     with all the hours that you've been putting in.\\
290 -  You just asked him to go to the movies.\\
291 -  Yeah, but our weird relationship was grandfathered     into their marriage, and yours was not.\\
292 -  Okay, I put new batteries in the smoke detectors.\\
293 -  Did you do the laundry?\\
294 -  I sure did.\\
295 - Ooh.\\
296 -  He's gonna be steamed.\\
297 -  Just like his dress shirts.\\
298 -  At least he can still clean the oven,     so that's something.\\
299 -  Oh, that's what he thinks.\\
300 - Where's your steel wool?\\
301 -  Right here.\\
302 -  We make quite the team.\\
303 -  Sure do.\\
304 -  Guys, you won't believe this.\\
305 -  I stopped by the university to check in on Howard and Amy,     and they were having fun.\\
306 -  Well, don't worry.\\
307 - He won't be having any fun     when he gets home.\\
308 -  I did all his favorite chores.\\
309 -  What are you talking about?\\
310 -  Howard hates doing chores.\\
311 -  Wait, then why would Bernadette tell me that...\\
312 - (gasps)\\
313 -   Bernadette.\\
314 -  Did you play on my well established gullibility     to clean your house?\\
315 -  Sure did.\\
316 -  Well, I would storm out of here,     but I already have the gloves and the steel wool,     and I really do love cleaning an oven.\\
317 - Move.\\
318 -  She made me do all her chores,     and it wasn't even her idea-- she stole it     from Tom Sawyer.     You know what?\\
319 - This is crazy.\\
320 -  Howard and Amy are working together-- get over it.\\
321 -  Leonard, what are you doing?\\
322 -  “Knowing when to say when.”     This is not a big deal.\\
323 -  It is a big deal.\\
324 -  Howard's getting Amy used to laughing and listening to music.\\
325 -  What if she expects that madness at home?\\
326 -  Yeah, that is a good point.\\
327 - I'm really proud of the way     you're able to express your feelings.\\
328 -   SHELDON:  Thank you.\\
329 -  I'm just so angry.\\
330 -  You know,     everyone gets angry.\\
331 -  Even mommies and daddies.\\
332 -  You can't think this is the right time     to “validate his behavior.”     Okay, what about “presenting a united front”?\\
333 -  What about you coddling him and he's never gonna learn?\\
334 -  Look.\\
335 -  You sound frustrated, and I'm really proud of the way     you're able to state your opinion.\\
336 -  Thank you.\\
337 -  Wait, no, no.\\
338 -  Don't use that book on me.\\
339 -   SHELDON:  W-Wait,     what book?\\
340 -   (groans)\\
341 - Penny's been using     one of Bernadette's parenting books on you.\\
342 -  What?\\
343 - So has he.\\
344 -  Wh-What makes you think you can treat me like a child?\\
345 -  Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.\\
346 -  That's because the adult shampoo burns my man eyes.\\
347 -  Hey, what are you working on?\\
348 -  Oh, my God, you're still here?\\
349 -  Well, of course I'm here.\\
350 -  I know what you're going through.\\
351 -  Really?\\
352 - You have a needy Indian man in your house?\\
353 -  I did, but then he came over here.\\
354 -  So is this how it's gonna be if we have kids?\\
355 -  You're just gonna throw me under the bus?\\
356 -  If you spoil them the way you do Sheldon, then, yeah.\\
357 -  Uh, my way was working.\\
358 -  Okay?\\
359 - I think you're just upset     because there are some things I am better than you at.\\
360 -  Well, you can't end a sentence with a preposition,     so clearly, not grammar.\\
361 -  If you're so smart, was that a smart thing to say?\\
362 -  That depends.\\
363 - Before I said it,     was s*x tonight still on the table?\\
364 -  No.\\
365 - Then it's fine.\\
366 -  You know, once we get this operational,     we could probably figure out how to make it wireless.\\
367 -  That'd be amazing.\\
368 -   (phone chimes)\\
369 -   Oh, that's Sheldon.\\
370 -  Oh, he's upset with Leonard and Penny.\\
371 -   (phone whooshes)\\
372 -   And Bernadette.\\
373 -   (phone whooshes)\\
374 -   And Mark Twain.\\
375 -  Yeah, Bernadette texted earlier.\\
376 -  Raj is really getting on her nerves.\\
377 -  Well, I guess we have been working late a lot.\\
378 -   (sighs)\\
379 -   Should we call it a night and go home?\\
380 -  Or we could brew a pot of coffee and power through.\\
381 -  I don't know, it's getting kind of late.\\
382 -  Hey, where's my watch?\\
383 -  Why don't you ask     your skeleton?\\
384 -   (Amy gasps)\\
385 -   Oh, my God.\\
386 -  How is that even possible?!\\
387 -  This is great, the two of us hanging out.\\
388 -  Why didn't we think of this earlier?\\
389 -  Agreed.\\
390 -  I don't need Amy to watch a movie.\\
391 -  I can not hold your hand just as easily.\\
392 -   (music begins playing over TV)\\
393 -   In the book this is based on, that man's the killer.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Proton Regeneration}
1 - Howie, slow down.\\
2 - I can't.\\
3 - I'm not allowed to eat for    hours before my surgery,   and I only got two more minutes.\\
4 - What surgery are you having?\\
5 - I'm stress eating.\\
6 - My best friend's getting a vasectomy tomorrow.\\
7 - And you're sad you won't be able to bear his child?\\
8 - Oh, my goodness.\\
9 - If it's “vasectomy gone wrong” videos,    he's seen them all.\\
10 - Including the one of the guy who's sitting    on what appears to be a cantaloupe but is not.\\
11 - And I'm done.\\
12 - They're going to start making    Professor Proton's science show again.\\
13 -  BERNADETTE:  I thought he passed away.\\
14 - He did.\\
15 - He was cremated, and his remains    were put in a baking soda volcano.\\
16 -  AMY:  Don't make jokes.\\
17 - He meant a lot to Sheldon.\\
18 -  LEONARD:  Oh, me, too.\\
19 - I grew up watching his show.\\
20 - He's one of the reasons I became a scientist.\\
21 - Aw.\\
22 - Thought you did it just to get girls.\\
23 - Joke's on you.\\
24 - It worked.\\
25 - Have they found anyone to replace him?\\
26 - No, not yet, and it won't be easy.\\
27 - Arthur Jeffries was an accomplished scientist.\\
28 - Mm.\\
29 - You know who'd make a great Professor Proton?\\
30 - Meryl Streep.\\
31 - She's not a scientist.\\
32 - Uh, then explain to me why    she has chemistry with literally everyone.\\
33 - It would be nice if they cast a woman.\\
34 - Oh, you've already got Doctor Who and the Ghostbusters.    Leave us something.\\
35 - Who do you think it should be?\\
36 - Well, it should be a scientist I respect.\\
37 - You know, someone with a pleasing voice    and symmetrical facial features.\\
38 - Is he talking about himself?\\
39 - If he's talking, he's talking about himself.\\
40 - I just know how much Professor Proton touched me as a child,    and I feel that I owe it to him    to try and touch as many children as possible.\\
41 - You should put that on your audition tape.\\
42 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
43 - Wait!\\
44 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      You doing okay?\\
45 - No, I'm very nervous.\\
46 -  (man groaning)\\
47 -  Where are you going?\\
48 - Gift shop.\\
49 - There is no gift shop.\\
50 - Sit down.\\
51 - This was your idea.\\
52 - So was having s*x, and look where that got us.\\
53 - This isn't a big deal.\\
54 - Stop whining.\\
55 - When you were in labor and I said that, you kicked me.\\
56 - Howard Wolowitz?\\
57 - Want me to go with you?\\
58 - No.\\
59 - I'll be fine.\\
60 - Yeah, we got this.\\
61 - Sit down!\\
62 - Wish me luck.\\
63 - Other way, buster.\\
64 - Okay, you ready?\\
65 - Yeah, almost.\\
66 - I'm working on my facial expressions.\\
67 - See, uh, I've got interested.\\
68 - Hmm.\\
69 - I've got very interested.\\
70 - Hmm.    Enraged.\\
71 - Why would you be enraged?\\
72 - Hmm.\\
73 - Better to have it and not need it    than to need it and not have it.\\
74 - Okay.\\
75 - And...\\
76 - rolling.\\
77 - Hello.\\
78 - I am theoretical physicist, Dr.\\
79 - Sheldon Cooper,    auditioning for the role of Professor Proton.\\
80 - Now, excuse me while I get into character.\\
81 - Hello.\\
82 - I am Professor Proton.\\
83 - And today,    boys and girls, we're going to have fun with science.\\
84 - Did you know you could calculate the mass of an electron    using household items?\\
85 - It's true.\\
86 - All you'll need is a pencil, some paper,    dry ice, rubbing alcohol,    and a spool of   -micron-thick cobalt-   wire.\\
87 - And, remember, don't put it in your mouth,    or instead of becoming a scientist,    you'll become wildly radioactive.\\
88 -  Hang on.\\
89 - I have a question.\\
90 -  Do you have any experiments that aren't life-threatening?\\
91 -  Come on!\\
92 - That was a perfect take, and you ruined it.\\
93 -  Oh, look!\\
94 - Hey, I did need enraged.\\
95 -  Ow.\\
96 - Ow.\\
97 - Ow.\\
98 - Ow.\\
99 -  Really hurts, huh?\\
100 -  BERNADETTE:  No.\\
101 -  He's just saying, “Ow can these prices be so low”.\\
102 -  It's gonna be okay.\\
103 - A day or two of rest,     and you'll be fine.\\
104 -  You know nothing about Jewish people.\\
105 -   (Halley crying over monitor)\\
106 -   Um, let me go check on her.\\
107 -  Okay, uh, this is a bit awkward.\\
108 -  It says here that I need to check the area     for redness and swelling.\\
109 -  You know what?\\
110 - It hurts so much, go ahead.\\
111 -  So you see, boys and girls,     H, or helicity, is the natural variable     to use relativistically and is defined as S dot P,     divided by the magnitude of P.\\
112 -  So the next time someone on the playground tells you     you can only use integral values for the matrix     that determines the spin of the antiproton,     you stop being friends with that kid, 'cause he's going nowhere.\\
113 -  Until next week, this is Professor Proton saying,                                       .\\
114 -  That's “bye” in ASCII binary,     or good-binary.\\
115 -   (laughing)\\
116 -    (snorts)\\
117 -   So, what do you think?\\
118 -   AMY:  Well, I already told him     that I loved it,     but if you found it confusing or dangerous or--     I don't know-- three to four times too long,     now is the time to share.\\
119 -  I...\\
120 - I don't know what to say.\\
121 -  Leonard, do you know what to say?\\
122 -  Sheldon, uh, I thought it, uh...\\
123 -  It-it looked like you were having so much fun.\\
124 -  Hey!\\
125 -  That's what you used to tell me to say to Penny     after one of her terrible plays.\\
126 -  Hey!\\
127 - Hey!\\
128 -  Well, what was wrong with it?\\
129 -  You know, did you find it...\\
130 -  borderline psychotic?\\
131 -  I mean,     I liked that about it, but...\\
132 -  you guys discuss.\\
133 -  Do you remember when you were a kid     and you'd watch Professor Proton?\\
134 -  Of course.\\
135 - Well,     did he ever make you-- I don't know--     hate science and the people who do it?\\
136 -  What are you saying?\\
137 -  I-I just think it would be...\\
138 - better     if your contempt for children     wasn't so much in the foreground.\\
139 -  Well, you want me to lie?\\
140 -  Well, it's not lying-- it's acting.\\
141 -  Sheldon Cooper may not like kids,     but Professor Proton loves them.\\
142 -  Interesting.\\
143 -  You know, I hadn't really thought     of it that way.\\
144 -  It-It's similar to how I'm afraid of dogs,     but my D&D character likes dogs, you know?\\
145 -  But he's allergic, so he can't be around them.\\
146 -  Why don't we have a dog?\\
147 -  Hey, you can always reshoot it.\\
148 -  Mm, I suppose.\\
149 - And, you know, maybe I could even get some tips     from someone who's acted professionally.\\
150 -  PENNY:  Oh.\\
151 -  Sheldon, obviously, I'd be happy to help you out.\\
152 -  I don't know what to say.\\
153 -  Hey, Sheldon.\\
154 - What's up?\\
155 -  I need an acting coach.\\
156 - Oh.\\
157 -  Would you give me Patrick Stewart's number?\\
158 -  No.\\
159 -  Fine.\\
160 - I guess you can do it.\\
161 -   (bell ringing)\\
162 -   WOLOWITZ:  Bernie?\\
163 -  Where did you get a bell?\\
164 -  App store.\\
165 -   (bell ringing)\\
166 -   Fun.\\
167 - Let me see.\\
168 -   (chuckles)\\
169 -   When you catch me, you can have it back.\\
170 -  You want to lie down,     watch a movie?\\
171 -  I can't.\\
172 - I got my   -week checkup to get to,     and then I'll pick up some Chinese for dinner.\\
173 -  I'll take Halley with me.\\
174 -  You-you sure you're not overdoing it?\\
175 -  No, it's fine.\\
176 - Great.\\
177 -  Then maybe, instead of Chinese,     fire up the grill and throw on a couple of steaks?\\
178 -  Kung pao chicken, please.\\
179 -  Oh, boy.\\
180 - What?\\
181 -  They cast the new Professor Proton.\\
182 -  Is it Sheldon?\\
183 -  Not exactly.\\
184 -   SHELDON:  Wheaton!\\
185 -  It's Wil Wheaton.\\
186 -   BERNADETTE:  Hi.\\
187 -  Hey.\\
188 -  How was the doctor?\\
189 -  Good, but I have some news.\\
190 -  Don't say twins.\\
191 - Don't say twins.\\
192 - Don't say twins.\\
193 -  Don't say twins.\\
194 -  It's not twins.\\
195 -  Oh.\\
196 - I mean, because I would have loved them both.\\
197 -  The doctor said I was overdoing it,     so she put me on bed rest just to be safe.\\
198 -  Oh, no.\\
199 -  It may not look like it, but I'm running to you!\\
200 -   (insects trilling, birds chirping)\\
201 -   Hello, Arthur.\\
202 -  What-what part of “rest in peace”     don't you understand?\\
203 -  I suppose you're here because you heard the news?\\
204 -  Sheldon, I'm a figment of your imagination.\\
205 -  I don't hear news.\\
206 -  You're a grumpy figment.\\
207 -  Look, they're remaking your show,     and they cast Wil Wheaton as Professor Proton.\\
208 -  And the worst part is, he's not even a scientist.\\
209 -  No, the-the worst part is,     I'm sitting on a moist log.\\
210 -  We have to stop this and protect your legacy.\\
211 -  What legacy?\\
212 -  My-my last two seasons, I was on Sunday morning     at  :  .\\
213 -  We-we were beat by Davey and Goliath.     I can't believe you don't care.\\
214 -  Believe it.\\
215 -  Well, I care, a lot,     and Wil Wheaton will rue the day he ever met me.\\
216 -  I think that's true of most people.\\
217 -   (light knocking)\\
218 - Hi, guys.\\
219 -  Wanted to check in and see how you two were doing.\\
220 -  We're okay.\\
221 -  Yeah, hanging out in bed with my wife,     thawing out some frozen peas in my pants-- living the dream.\\
222 -   (Halley crying)\\
223 -   Oh, I'll get her.\\
224 -  I thought Raj was helping you out.\\
225 -  No, he had to work.\\
226 -  Plus, he has a quota     for the amount of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate,     and, apparently, I filled it.\\
227 -  Well, you're...\\
228 - I can get the baby.\\
229 -  No, Howie's got it.\\
230 - He's fine.\\
231 - Right, Howie?\\
232 -   (strained) : Never better.\\
233 -  Don't be silly.\\
234 -  I'll take the rest of the day off and watch Halley for you.\\
235 -  Or we can call Stuart.\\
236 -  I'm sure he could close up the store,     hop on a bus, and be here in no time.\\
237 -  He does love the bus.\\
238 -  Okay, hang on.\\
239 -  Do you guys not trust me to take care of your baby?\\
240 -   (chuckling) : No.\\
241 - No!\\
242 -  No.\\
243 - No.\\
244 -  So I-I guess...\\
245 -  no.\\
246 -  Wow.\\
247 -  It's not that we don't trust you-- it's just you don't seem     like much of a baby person.\\
248 - Hey,     hey, hey, I can watch your stupid baby, okay?\\
249 -  If she cries, I will pick her up.\\
250 -  If she's hungry, I'll give her a bottle.\\
251 -  And if she poops, I'll light some incense.\\
252 -  It would be a big help.\\
253 -  Okay.\\
254 - Thank you.\\
255 -  Trust me, you guys have nothing to worry about.\\
256 -  You know, back in Nebraska,     I raised all our baby pigs     right until the day they were slaughtered.\\
257 -  So, unless your baby's made of breakfast meat,     she's fine.\\
258 -  Would you ever get a vasectomy?\\
259 -  Uh, in case you haven't noticed, Indians aren't     too big on birth control.\\
260 -  There's probably, like, a million more of us     since we started this conversation.\\
261 -  Ugh.\\
262 -  You okay?\\
263 -  No.\\
264 -  No, all these comments online about Wil,     they're nothing but supportive and kind.\\
265 -  Where's the mean, snarky Internet     that shows up every time I get a haircut?\\
266 -  You know that's us, right?\\
267 -  Well, luckily, I got the number of the company     who's trying to reboot the show,     so I need you all to call and register your displeasure.\\
268 -  Sheldon, no one's gonna do that.\\
269 -  Not true.\\
270 - I know of three calls they've received already:     a-a Southern gentleman,     um, a Cockney chimney sweep,     and, uh,     Mr.\\
271 - T, hmm?\\
272 -  Who-- spoiler alert--     pities the fool who tries to reboot that show.\\
273 -  What about tiresome lunatic with a bad haircut?\\
274 -  Has he called yet?\\
275 -  Come on.\\
276 -  How many times have we banded together     to try to save a show that we loved?\\
277 -  L-Let's shake things up and try to kill one.\\
278 -  Isn't the important thing that there's a show     to get kids excited about science?\\
279 -  Who cares about kids and what they like?\\
280 -  This is about me and something I liked when-when I was a kid.\\
281 -  What if the reboot is great?\\
282 -  That's even worse.\\
283 -  If-if I like it, I'll feel like I'm being disloyal to Arthur.\\
284 -  He was a mentor and a friend,     and I won't toss him aside for some Hollywood pretty boy     like Wil Wheaton.\\
285 -  It's hard to argue with him.\\
286 -  Because he makes no sense?\\
287 - Yeah.\\
288 -  This is actually kind of nice,     you and me getting to spend a couple days in bed together.\\
289 -  Yeah.\\
290 - Pretty soon, we're gonna have two crying babies     in the house.\\
291 - (sighs)\\
292 -   I'm glad my balls hurt.\\
293 - It's all their fault.\\
294 -  Well, let's just enjoy this quiet time     while we still got it.\\
295 -  Yeah.\\
296 -  Yeah, it is really quiet.\\
297 -  You think Penny's doing okay?\\
298 -  Penny, everything all right?!\\
299 -   (footsteps approaching)\\
300 -   Hey.\\
301 - All good.\\
302 -  Dipped her pacifier in a little bourbon, she conked right out.\\
303 -  I hope you're joking.\\
304 -  Of course I'm joking.\\
305 - I don't share my bourbon.\\
306 -  She's joking.\\
307 -   (chuckles)\\
308 - Definitely.\\
309 -  Probably.\\
310 -  Wil Wheaton.\\
311 - Wil Wheaton.\\
312 -  This is Sheldon, by the way.\\
313 -  Hi, Sheldon.\\
314 -  Here, I found this pizza flyer in your fence.\\
315 -  Thank you.\\
316 -  Okay, now you owe me a favor.\\
317 -  Turn down the role of Professor Proton.\\
318 -   (chuckles)\\
319 - I don't think so.\\
320 -  You can't be Professor Proton.\\
321 - You're not a scientist.\\
322 -  Well, I was never on a starship,     but pretending I was bought me this house.\\
323 -  And if I'd pretended a little longer,     it would have a swimming pool.\\
324 -  Some things shouldn't be rebooted.\\
325 -  Some things were perfect the way they were.\\
326 -  Like the walled city of York-- it was a delight.\\
327 -  But New York?\\
328 - Blech.\\
329 -  Did you ever consider that maybe Arthur would be happy to know     that his show has outlived him?\\
330 -  I doubt it.\\
331 -  He was kind of a mean old crank.\\
332 -  Sheldon, I promise that I will work my hardest     to make this show great     so that a whole new generation of kids     will grow up and they will be able to say     that Professor Proton was the reason they got into science.\\
333 -  Wow.\\
334 -  That was very persuasive.\\
335 -  Thanks.\\
336 -  But I won't be seduced by your acting skills     nor your movie star charisma.\\
337 -  There's only one Professor Proton,     and he had neither of those things.\\
338 -  I'll give you one more chance to bow out.\\
339 -  Or what?\\
340 -  When we first met, we were enemies,     but we worked through that and we became friends.\\
341 -  Do you really want to go back?\\
342 -  Honestly, it doesn't feel very different.\\
343 -  I'm not leaving!\\
344 -  All right, I'm gonna sic my dog on you.\\
345 -  You don't have a dog.\\
346 -  Yes, I do.\\
347 -  Ugh, I can't tell if you're lying--     you're such a good actor!\\
348 -  Hey, how you doing?\\
349 -  What are you doing here?\\
350 -  Oh, I just came by, you know, to see if you need any help.\\
351 -  Howard and Bernadette asked you to check up on me.\\
352 -  That is not entirely true.\\
353 -  So did Leonard and...\\
354 - everybody.\\
355 -  How irresponsible do you all think I am?\\
356 -  We don't think you're irresponsible.\\
357 -  We think you're...\\
358 -  fun-loving.\\
359 -  That is just a nice word for “irresponsible.”     Hmm.\\
360 - You might be more on the ball than we thought.\\
361 -  I'm getting a little hungry.\\
362 -  Want me to get it this time?\\
363 -  That'd be great.\\
364 -   (bell ringing)\\
365 -   This is fun.\\
366 -  And now you also get to see an annoyed blonde     walk into the room.\\
367 -  What?\\
368 -  Can you get us a little snack?\\
369 -  You sure you don't want your spy to do it?\\
370 -  What are you talking about?\\
371 -  You really don't trust me?\\
372 - You had to have Amy stop by?\\
373 -  We trust you.\\
374 - Yeah.\\
375 -  You were a terrible waitress,     and we still asked you to get us a snack.\\
376 -   (Halley crying)\\
377 -   Excuse me while I go take care of your baby.\\
378 -  Then I'll bring you your snack,     and you can insult me some more.\\
379 -   (crying continues)\\
380 -   I don't know about you,     but I am not eating whatever she brings us.\\
381 -   PENNY:  Hey, Halley.\\
382 - Aw, it's okay.\\
383 -  Auntie Penny's here.\\
384 - Shh.\\
385 - Let's get you changed.\\
386 -  Your mommy and daddy say they trust me,     but they're full of the same stuff your diaper is.\\
387 -   (crying stops)\\
388 -   Now I feel bad.\\
389 -  Well, she never really liked me.\\
390 -  It's kind of nice she hates you now, too.\\
391 -  Aw, but I'm here for you,     and I would never let anything happen to you,     because your Auntie Penny loves you so much.\\
392 -   HALLEY:  Mama.\\
393 -  Was that her first word?\\
394 -  Mama.\\
395 -   PENNY:  Uh, no.\\
396 - No, baby.\\
397 - I'm not your mama.\\
398 -  Your mama's the nice lady we're gonna go see right now     so I can rub this in her face.\\
399 -  Do you hear that, suckers?\\
400 -  She called me Mama!\\
401 -   (insects trilling, birds chirping)\\
402 -   Hello, Arthur.\\
403 -  You-you know,     we could...\\
404 - we could also meet in-in a deli.\\
405 -  I'm sorry to say that I failed you.\\
406 -  I tried to stop Wil Wheaton being Professor Proton,     but I couldn't.\\
407 -  See, now, that's-that's the kind of thing     you could tell a fella over a...\\
408 -  pastrami sandwich.\\
409 -  Well, don't worry.\\
410 -  He's now on my enemies list forever.\\
411 -  He's totally cut off.\\
412 -  Interesting.\\
413 -  Can-can anyone sign-sign up for that list?
\subsection {Episode 07: The Geology Methodology}
1 - Hey, uh, who's free tonight?\\
2 - - Oh, I think I'm...\\
3 - - Hang on.\\
4 - We've made this mistake before.\\
5 - It's how we wound up at   his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.\\
6 - Hey, you use that collapsible bowl all the time,   and you know it.\\
7 - And it's not like that.\\
8 - I just thought we could, you know, hang out and go to a bar.\\
9 - - Sure.\\
10 - - Very well.\\
11 - - Sounds fun.\\
12 - And watch cricket.\\
13 - That sound you hear, ironically, crickets.\\
14 - Hey, guys.\\
15 - - Hey, Bert.\\
16 - - ¿How you doing?\\
17 - Well, you know, we geologists    always get a little sad when Rocktober's over.\\
18 - - Wordplay?\\
19 - - Yes.\\
20 - Funny wordplay?\\
21 - - What do you think?\\
22 - - Eh.\\
23 - Trust your gut.\\
24 - Sheldon, I've got these    four-billion-year-old meteorites.\\
25 - I thought maybe they'd show signs of neutrino interactions.\\
26 - I could really use someone like you to help me with the math.\\
27 - Oh, so they would act as natural dark matter detectors.\\
28 - That sounds interesting.\\
29 - It does, but it's still geology.\\
30 - Sorry, Bert, I don't have time to play rocks with you.\\
31 - I'm not asking you to play rocks.\\
32 - I'm asking you to collaborate on a research project.\\
33 - Although, if there's time,    I guess we could play a round    of zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.\\
34 - Does sound better than cricket.\\
35 - Thank you for asking.\\
36 - Unfortunately, I have real science to do.\\
37 - But you feel free to rock on.\\
38 - That's how you do it.\\
39 - All right.\\
40 - Sheldon, what are you doing?\\
41 - Bert's one of the top guys in his field.\\
42 - And somewhere there's a mime who's top in his field,    but you don't see me rushing to collaborate with him    on new ways to be stuck in a box.\\
43 - Also something I would watch instead of cricket.\\
44 - Oh.\\
45 - (chuckles)\\
46 - Hello.\\
47 - Hey, Sheldon.\\
48 - I've been thinking about it, and I suppose    I-I could help you with your research.\\
49 - What changed your mind?\\
50 - Bert, I'm a gift horse.\\
51 - Don't look me in the mouth.\\
52 - Sorry.\\
53 - I'm happy you want to help out.\\
54 - If it's easier for you, we could just work at your office.\\
55 - No, no, no, not my office, no.\\
56 - Uh, let's-let's do it here,    in-in the evenings, after everyone's gone home.\\
57 - I just have to see if my evenings are free.\\
58 - That's a joke.\\
59 - They are.\\
60 - Okay.\\
61 - Well, then I will see you tonight.\\
62 - (gasps)\\
63 - Well, you know what?\\
64 - (stammers)\\
65 - Close the blinds.\\
66 - We can start right now.\\
67 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
68 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
69 - Wait!\\
70 -     \\
71 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
72 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools     \\
73 -  We built the Wall  \\
74 -  We built the pyramids     \\
75 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery     \\
76 -  That all started with a big bang     \\
77 -  Bang!     \\
78 - (crowd cheering)\\
79 - (sportscast playing over TV)\\
80 - I don't get how you can enjoy cricket.\\
81 - It makes no sense.\\
82 - Did you just come here to complain?\\
83 - Yeah.\\
84 - That's the sport of my people.\\
85 - Ooh, that's Ravichandran Ashwin.\\
86 - He's amazing.\\
87 - He makes Hardik Pandya look like Bhuvneshwar Kumar.\\
88 - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, save some syllables for the rest of us.\\
89 - Hey, I think that's Bernadette's friend over there.\\
90 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, yeah.\\
91 - Hey, Ruchi!\\
92 - I-I hope this isn't awkward.\\
93 - The last time we met, I kind of embarrassed myself.\\
94 - Let's see if you can go two for two.\\
95 - Hey, guys.\\
96 - Hey.\\
97 - - Hi.\\
98 - - Are you here by yourself?\\
99 - Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone to come watch cricket with me.\\
100 - (chuckles)\\
101 - Tell me about it.\\
102 - I had to drag this guy.\\
103 - You're more than welcome to join us if you'd like.\\
104 - Thanks.\\
105 - (crowd groans)\\
106 - Arre uske taang pay ball kar!    What'd she say?\\
107 - Uske taang pay ball kar.     Oh, that clears that up.\\
108 - Well, no, she's telling the bowler to bowl a yorker.\\
109 - It's the most brutal ball in cricket.\\
110 - I was at the match when Shoaib bowled back-to-back yorkers.\\
111 - Well, I was there, too!\\
112 - What a coincidence!\\
113 - Well, there were    ,    people at that match, so...\\
114 - Yeah, India, right?\\
115 - Everywhere you go,     there's, like,    ,    people.\\
116 - (chuckles)\\
117 - So what do you think of     our chances at the World Cup?\\
118 - Ah, World Cup.\\
119 - You know, it'll all depend     if Kohli's batting in form.\\
120 - I know.\\
121 - It doesn't even matter how many all-rounders you have.\\
122 - Isn't that the truth?\\
123 - You know, I was the best leg spinner in my high school?\\
124 - Yeah, like, I bowled the meanest googly.\\
125 - Speaking of googlies, I'm gonna go.\\
126 - I've been modeling different types of dark matter     and the traces they would leave     on the zircon inside your meteorite.\\
127 - What's this one here?\\
128 - That's actually a dark matter model of my own creation.\\
129 - I call it the Cooper Boson.\\
130 - Cool.\\
131 - I got to name a rock once.\\
132 - I named it Moderately Sedimented Shale.\\
133 - Guess I kind of pooped the bed on that one.\\
134 - You know, Bert, I've got to say,     this work has been surprisingly engaging.\\
135 - Yeah, it's pretty cool.\\
136 - (ringtone playing)\\
137 - Hello, Amy.\\
138 - (stammers)\\
139 - What do you mean, where am I?\\
140 - I'm in my office.\\
141 - No, I'm at your office and you're not here.\\
142 - I thought I'd surprise you with dinner.\\
143 - For future reference, the best surprises     are the ones I know about three days in advance.\\
144 - Where are you?\\
145 - It's a surprise.\\
146 - Doesn't feel so good, does it?\\
147 - Well, I have food.\\
148 - I thought we could eat together,     but I guess if you have other plans...\\
149 - What?!\\
150 - I'm here!\\
151 - Exactly where I said I was.\\
152 - (panting)\\
153 - Let's eat.\\
154 - Hello.\\
155 - - Hey, buddy, what's up?\\
156 - - Hey.\\
157 - Um, I need to talk to Penny alone.\\
158 - (laughs)\\
159 - What can I do for you?\\
160 - Just a minute, I want to make sure Leonard can't hear us.\\
161 - (loudly): I've got a box of cupcakes.\\
162 - Okay, we're good.\\
163 - I'm working with Bert, but I don't want anyone to find out.\\
164 - Well, you just told me, so strong start.\\
165 - Penny, this is serious.\\
166 - My reputation is on the line.\\
167 - What are people gonna think when they see us collaborating?\\
168 - I don't know.\\
169 - Poor Bert?\\
170 - I am a respected theoretical physicist.\\
171 - I aspire to win a Nobel Prize someday.\\
172 - But nobody's gonna take me seriously     if they find out I've been dabbling in geology.\\
173 - Well, why not?\\
174 - They're both sciences.\\
175 - And I know because they're classes     my high school counselor said “weren't for me.”     They're very different.\\
176 - Physics answers the question:     what is the nature of the universe?\\
177 - Geology answers the question: what'd I just trip over?\\
178 - All right, well, then don't work with Bert.\\
179 - Oh, but I like the work.\\
180 - Then work with him.\\
181 - Yeah, but I'm ashamed of the field.\\
182 - - Then don't work with him.\\
183 - - Yeah, but we could prove dark matter.\\
184 - Then work with him.\\
185 - But I just think that people...\\
186 - How many times are you gonna do this?\\
187 - My record is   .\\
188 - Okay, this is about science.\\
189 - Why'd you come to me?\\
190 - Well, because it's also about my reputation.\\
191 - And somehow you manage to hold your head high     despite your checkered past.\\
192 - Checkered past?\\
193 - It's a figure of speech     referring to how sexually promiscuous you were.\\
194 - Really?\\
195 - Well, I've got a figure of speech about     how sexually promiscuous you can go be with yourself.\\
196 - And what is it?\\
197 - Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest,     we're gonna have to divide and conquer.\\
198 - I've got one monitor for her, one for the baby.\\
199 - Which do you want?\\
200 - I'll take the baby.\\
201 - She's less emasculating.\\
202 - Good morning!\\
203 - Scones?\\
204 - Ah, thanks.\\
205 - They're all for you; I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.\\
206 - You're kidding.\\
207 - You slept with her?\\
208 - Well, there wasn't a lot of sleeping involved.\\
209 - I mean, she slept, I stayed awake.\\
210 - I was afraid of snoring 'cause I didn't have my special pillow.\\
211 - BERNADETTE: Howard!\\
212 - Can you help me to the bathroom?!\\
213 - Well, at least the romance is still alive.\\
214 - So, you and Ruchi?\\
215 - Yeah, I'm sorry.\\
216 - I know you liked her, too,     but we just bumped into each other last night and hit it off.\\
217 - No, that's fine.\\
218 - You're my friend and I'm happy for you.\\
219 - Oh, thank you, Stuart.\\
220 - Plus, I don't know how you're gonna screw it up,     but I know you will.\\
221 - What's there to screw up?\\
222 - She just wants to keep things casual.\\
223 - Oh, great, that's how you're gonna screw it up.\\
224 - Hey, I can be casual.\\
225 - Mm-hmm.\\
226 - I should get a haircut; this thing's going south fast.\\
227 - So Ruchi and I decided to keep things casual.\\
228 - (scoffs)\\
229 - What?\\
230 - What?\\
231 - I can handle casual.\\
232 - (scoffs): Oh...\\
233 - Why do you keep doing that with your face?\\
234 - Because you keep saying stupid things with yours.\\
235 - Okay, fine.\\
236 - I'm not great at casual relationships,     and I don't want to scare her off.\\
237 - All right, just give her some space, all right?\\
238 - Don't call, don't text, don't e-mail.\\
239 - That's crazy.\\
240 - What if I see a sunset that reminds me of her?\\
241 - All right, when do you see her next?\\
242 - Uh, we're having dinner tonight.\\
243 - Okay, put a rubber band around your wrist,     and any time you start planning your wedding     or naming your children,     I want you to stab yourself in the hand with a fork.\\
244 - What's the rubber band for?\\
245 - To slow the bleeding.\\
246 - Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?\\
247 - She lies around all day eating Mallomars and hollering at me,     so her transformation from my wife to my mother is complete.\\
248 - Congratulations.\\
249 - I know that's what you were hoping for.\\
250 - Sheldon, you left your jacket in my office last night.\\
251 - Uh, oh.\\
252 - No-no, I didn't.\\
253 - That's-that's not my jacket.\\
254 - Then why does it say,     “Property of S.\\
255 - Cooper.\\
256 - Stop touching it”?\\
257 - It sounds like someone named Scooper     doesn't want you touching his jacket.\\
258 - Are you guys working together     on that meteorite project?\\
259 - (sighs)\\
260 - Yes, fine, you found me out.\\
261 - I'm doing geology.\\
262 - Just, please, don't tell anyone.\\
263 - Are you embarrassed of me?\\
264 - Oh, no, no, no, not you.\\
265 - No, just the work that you've devoted your entire life to.\\
266 - If you're ashamed to be working with me,     then I don't want to work with you.\\
267 - Sheldon, that was pretty rude.\\
268 - Well, what do you expect?\\
269 - He's a geologist.\\
270 - This place seems nice.\\
271 - Uh, but not too nice.\\
272 - Yelp called it “good for groups.”     Would you care to buy the lady a...?\\
273 - No!\\
274 - Get out of here!\\
275 - Sorry about that.\\
276 - I just, I hate when someone assumes two people are dating     just because they look like     they would make beautiful babies together.\\
277 - Are you sure you're okay with this?\\
278 - Honestly, Ruchi, I don't have a lot of experience     with casual relationships.\\
279 - I have some experience with serious relationships     and a ton of experience with no relationships.\\
280 - You're funny.\\
281 - Glad it came off that way.\\
282 - (chuckles)\\
283 - Uh, so tell me about your day.\\
284 - How's work going?\\
285 - Well, I spent the morning reviewing side effects     for our fungal cream, so it was a lot of ooze and pus.\\
286 -  Oh, almost paradise      \\
287 -  We're knocking on heaven's door      \\
288 -  Almost paradise...      \\
289 - And then I had to catalog it     by color, viscosity     and percentage of blood.\\
290 -  Paradise.      \\
291 - Sounds wonderful.\\
292 - Hey.\\
293 - Hmm.\\
294 - What you got there?\\
295 - A rock.\\
296 - Did some mean boys throw it at you?\\
297 - It turns out I'm the mean boy.\\
298 - Although I did drop it on my own foot, so kind of.\\
299 - What's going on?\\
300 - What if there was something I wanted to do,     but I was worried other people would think less of me?\\
301 - Is that other person me, and does it happen in the bedroom,     in which case I think I'm cool with it?\\
302 - No.\\
303 - It's about working with Bert on...\\
304 - You know what?\\
305 - I'm not even gonna say it.\\
306 - I am just gonna say the letter it starts with     and “ology.”     “G”-- Oh, no, that's not gonna work.\\
307 - Geology?\\
308 - Yes.\\
309 - But we parted ways     because I was worried about my reputation.\\
310 - Sheldon, you've never cared what people thought,     even when you really, really should.\\
311 - That dinner with my parents comes to mind.\\
312 - If I'm not gonna use “your momma” jokes     when I meet your mother, why'd I bother to learn them?\\
313 - I'm just saying, if you think the work is interesting,     nothing else should matter.\\
314 - You're right, Amy.\\
315 - That is sage advice.\\
316 - Which is surprising, considering your momma is so dumb, she...\\
317 - Nope.\\
318 - She studied for a urine test.\\
319 - I was supposed to go back to India and get married,     but I realized it wasn't what I wanted.\\
320 - So I called off the engagement and moved out here.\\
321 - Well, if he wasn't your soul mate, he wasn't your soul mate.\\
322 - Oh, God, please tell me you're not one of those.\\
323 - One of whats?\\
324 - I want to say teenage girls, but that sounds mean.\\
325 - Come on, you don't believe that everyone has one perfect match?\\
326 - Of course not.\\
327 - That's ridiculous.\\
328 - I mean, what if     your soul mate lived halfway across the world?\\
329 - You'd never meet.\\
330 - Yes, you would.\\
331 - I can give you, like,    examples     where that happened to Kate Hudson alone.\\
332 - You know what?\\
333 - People get upset when I talk about this.\\
334 - Let's just change the subject.\\
335 - No, no, no.\\
336 - No, it's-it's fine.\\
337 - Are you saying that you don't believe two people fall in love?\\
338 - Of course they do.\\
339 - It's just that what people call “love”     is actually a series of biochemical reactions     in the brain that fade over time.\\
340 - Yes.\\
341 - Like the old song,     “When a man has a biochemical reaction for a woman.”     Raj, we're scientists.\\
342 - We don't need to feel threatened     just because we understand the mechanisms     that give rise to romantic feelings.\\
343 - It doesn't take anything away from the experience.\\
344 - Yes, it does.\\
345 - Actually, it takes everything away from it.\\
346 - Love isn't just science.\\
347 - Okay?\\
348 - It's-it's spiritual.\\
349 - It's an acknowledgment of a mystery     that's greater than ourselves.\\
350 - It's what makes people write songs and poems,     and what has kept The Bachelor on TV for    magical seasons.\\
351 - Don't you think the fact that love is given away as a prize     on a game show slightly undermines your argument?\\
352 - Uh, yes.\\
353 - But I've never missed an episode,     and I dare science to explain that.\\
354 - Bert.\\
355 - Bert, Bert.\\
356 - Bert, Bert, Bert.\\
357 - What do you want, Sheldon?\\
358 - I would like us to work together again.\\
359 - I promise to keep my geology comments to myself,     because while some of them are funny, all of them are mean.\\
360 - Well, this is awkward.\\
361 - Leonard, what are you doing here?\\
362 - Bert asked for my help.\\
363 - BERT: Yeah, he's an excellent scientist,     and he doesn't tell me     what time I can go to the bathroom.\\
364 - It's called bladder training.\\
365 - When you're in your   s, you'll thank me for it.\\
366 - Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert,     and he walked away from you.\\
367 - So I feel like there's a lot he could teach me.\\
368 - Bert, please.\\
369 - (stammers)\\
370 - I know I behaved poorly in the past,     but things will be different this time.\\
371 - You'll see.\\
372 - Come on, let me in.\\
373 - We'll have some laughs,     we'll calculate some isotope ratios.\\
374 - I'm sorry, Sheldon.\\
375 - So you just shut the door in his face?\\
376 - I got to start writing this stuff down.\\
377 - I mean, Ruchi's nice.\\
378 - We're just so different.\\
379 - I know.\\
380 - Sometimes when you're dating,     you meet weird people.\\
381 - I once met a girl who didn't like juggling.\\
382 - And she still doesn't.\\
383 - So you're not gonna see her again?\\
384 - What's the point?\\
385 - We're never gonna be in a real relationship.\\
386 - Right, so you'll only be in a physical one?\\
387 - Exactly.\\
388 - Why would I want to spend time with someone like that?\\
389 - Someone who is just interested in s*x?\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - Raj, do you real...\\
392 - Whoa, hold on.\\
393 - Give him a chance.\\
394 - He's gonna get this.\\
395 - I don't think he is.\\
396 - What is there to get?\\
397 - She doesn't want to fall in love.\\
398 - At that point,     all we are is two single people     who find each other attractive and enjoy having--     Oh, got to go!\\
399 - So how was your night with Ruchi?\\
400 - Oh, great.\\
401 - We ordered in some food, we had s*x, I left.\\
402 - I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.\\
403 - (chuckles)\\
404 - I can field that one for her.\\
405 - I mean, I did get a little misty when we said good-bye,     but I played it off as allergies.\\
406 - I don't know if she bought it.\\
407 - Again, I know.\\
408 - Sheldon?\\
409 - You okay?\\
410 - Sheldon.\\
411 -  Oh, almost paradise      \\
412 -  We're knocking on heaven's door      \\
413 -  Almost paradise      \\
414 -  How could we ask for more?      \\
415 -  Paradise. 
\subsection {Episode 08: The Tesla Recoil}
1 - Can we start the movie?\\
2 - Before Sheldon gets here?\\
3 - Last time we did that, he didn't talk to us for a month.\\
4 - So do it!\\
5 - Hold on.\\
6 - Where is he?\\
7 - Well, according to his text, he was on the second floor,   then he stopped to tie his shoe.\\
8 - (phone chimes)\\
9 - All tied, and...\\
10 - Hello!\\
11 - Hi.\\
12 - Sorry we're late.\\
13 - Amy took forever tying my shoe.\\
14 - KOOTHRAPPALI: All right!\\
15 - Who's excited to see a documentary?\\
16 - Oh, I know this one.\\
17 - Nobody ever.\\
18 - Hey!\\
19 - This one's going to be great.\\
20 - This is about the rivalry    between a cool renegade scientist, Nikola Tesla,    and his arch-nemesis, Thomas Edison.\\
21 - It's the greatest scientific feud of all time.\\
22 - I mean, you can forget about Leibniz and Newton.\\
23 - Done.\\
24 - So, Tesla's the one that invented the electric car?\\
25 - (laughter)\\
26 - SHELDON: No, Penny.\\
27 - No, the car is just named after him.\\
28 - Okay, you don't have to be so smug about it.\\
29 - You know, you went to see that movie It    because you thought it was about scary I.T. guys.\\
30 - Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid.\\
31 - Edison just wanted to get rich and famous.\\
32 - Didn't he invent the lightbulb?\\
33 - That's what he wants you to think.\\
34 - But without the foundational work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,    Warren de la Rue and James Bowman Lindsay,    you wouldn't know Edison any more than you know    Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay.\\
35 - Isn't he sexy all fired up?\\
36 - He really gets my current alternating,    if you know what I mean.\\
37 - Edison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully.\\
38 - Yeah, he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy    just to make himself famous.\\
39 - If I had an elephant named Topsy,    he would want for nothing.\\
40 - Also, he'd be named Jumbo.\\
41 - And worse than that, Edison filmed the first on-screen kiss,    so he's basically a pornographer.\\
42 - Although every time I put that in Wikipedia,    someone takes it out.\\
43 - Is your current still alternating?\\
44 - We're lucky there aren't any elephants in here.\\
45 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
46 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
47 -  The Earth began to cool \\
48 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
49 -  We built the Wall \\
50 -  We built the pyramids \\
51 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
52 -  That all started with a big bang \\
53 -  Bang! \\
54 - You know, that documentary last night was actually    better than I thought it would be.\\
55 - Really?\\
56 - Should've been about Samuel Morse    the way they telegraphed that ending.\\
57 - I already pretended to laugh at that joke once.\\
58 - Do I have to do it again?\\
59 - Yeah, I'd appreciate it.\\
60 - (chuckles)\\
61 - (forced laugh): Samuel Morse.\\
62 - You kill me.\\
63 - Leonard, can you drive me to work?\\
64 - Yeah, sure.\\
65 - Oh, hey, the guys and I    were talking about going to see the Tesla coil    at the observatory later on, if you want to join.\\
66 - Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.\\
67 - I'm busy.\\
68 - Why?\\
69 - What are you doing?\\
70 - Leonard, what are you doing?\\
71 - He said he can't go.\\
72 - Make a sad face, move on.\\
73 - It's fine.\\
74 - I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.\\
75 - What does that mean?\\
76 - Leonard!\\
77 - Sad face, sad face.\\
78 - I mean, I would like to, but I just can't, you know,    because it's classified and top secret.\\
79 - Hold on, are you still working for the military?\\
80 - I'm so glad you figured that out!\\
81 - It was killing me keeping it a secret!\\
82 - I thought they fired you guys.\\
83 - They did, but then they hired me back.\\
84 - Well, you better not be working on our project,    because we're a team.\\
85 - Leonard, there is no "I" in team.\\
86 - However, there is an "I" in    "I'm working with the military and you're not."    There's five of them, in fact.\\
87 - (knock on door)\\
88 - Hey, hey.\\
89 - I got a big surprise for you.\\
90 - Is it pie and ice cream?\\
91 - (chuckles)\\
92 - Wow, did I oversell it.\\
93 - It's Raj and Ruchi!\\
94 - Hello.\\
95 - Hey.\\
96 - Hi.\\
97 - Hey, what are you two doing here?\\
98 - RUCHI: We won't stay long.\\
99 - I just wanted to drop something off     from me and the girls at work.\\
100 - None of the girls at work like me enough to get me a gift.\\
101 - Okay, so you'll know why everyone at the office     has the same handwriting.\\
102 - I really appreciate the thought,     but it's not necessary.\\
103 - I'll be back soon.\\
104 - Don't worry about work.\\
105 - You take all the time you need.\\
106 - Yeah, just turn off your brain     and let your uterus do its magic.\\
107 - It's the star of the show now.\\
108 - Okay, wasn't sure how long I should let you guys stay.\\
109 - Now I know!\\
110 - Get out!\\
111 - Good to see you.\\
112 - You look amazing.\\
113 - Thanks for coming!\\
114 - (door closes)\\
115 - That bitch.\\
116 - Oh, come on, he means well.\\
117 - He's just trying to impress his girlfriend.\\
118 - I'm talking about Ruchi.\\
119 - She's after my job.\\
120 - Why do you think she said, "Take all the time you need"?\\
121 - Because she was being nice?\\
122 - No, she's trying to steal my projects while I'm at home     taking care of this useless plant and my dumb family.\\
123 - I'm only saying this because I love you     and because you can't reach me from that bed,     but you sound a little crazy.\\
124 - I love you, too, but I could fling this card in your eye     like a ninja throwing star.\\
125 - I don't believe you.\\
126 - Why would the military want Sheldon?\\
127 - I don't know.\\
128 - Target practice?\\
129 - Well, he better not be working on our guidance system.\\
130 - That was my idea.\\
131 - Why don't we call Colonel Williams     and find out what's going on.\\
132 - Great.\\
133 - I want answers and he'd better give them to us.\\
134 - (line ringing)\\
135 - Hello, gentlemen.\\
136 - Hi, sir.\\
137 - Um, Leonard has a question.\\
138 - Hey, is Sheldon working on our project again?\\
139 - Did he say that?\\
140 - No, he wouldn't tell us.\\
141 - Huh.\\
142 - So he can keep his mouth shut.\\
143 - How do I get him to do that?\\
144 - Is he working on our guidance system or not?\\
145 - Dr.\\
146 - Cooper contacted us with an idea on how to modify     your technology into a communication system,     and it seemed interesting.\\
147 - But our team developed that technology.\\
148 - And he was your team leader.\\
149 - Well, who said he was team leader?\\
150 - He did.\\
151 - And I like that kind of "take charge" attitude.\\
152 - We can have "take charge" attitudes.\\
153 - Then why didn't either of you ask to be team leader?\\
154 - We didn't want to step on anyone's toes.\\
155 - WOLOWITZ: Yeah, so we were just     waiting for you to tell us who you thought-- Okay, I hear it.\\
156 - Are we done?\\
157 - LEONARD: No, no.\\
158 - I am taking charge right now and telling you     that it is not okay with us if...\\
159 - (call disconnects)\\
160 - Okay, bye.\\
161 - Hey.\\
162 - I just got your text.\\
163 - Everything okay?\\
164 - Yeah, there's just something I need to ask you.\\
165 - (gasps)\\
166 - Oh, Bernie, I'd be thrilled.\\
167 - It's not be my birth coach.\\
168 - Okay, that hurts, but luckily I know how to breathe through it.\\
169 - (breathing sharply)\\
170 - I need you to find out if Ruchi's trying to steal     my projects at work while I'm on bed rest.\\
171 - She's not that kind of a person.\\
172 - She's-she's generous and charitable.\\
173 - You're just saying that 'cause she's sleeping with you.\\
174 - Yes, that's my favorite charity.\\
175 - I know I sound paranoid, but I'm feeling really vulnerable.\\
176 - If there's anything you could find out, it'd be great.\\
177 - And if she is up to anything, what are you gonna do?\\
178 - Nothing.\\
179 - I'll just calmly talk to her and explain     there are certain boundaries that need to be respected.\\
180 - It's really for the benefit of everyone at the company.\\
181 - Uh, okay, what you're saying sounds nice,     but the way you're saying it     is causing my testicles to take cover in my abdomen.\\
182 - What do you want to watch?\\
183 - Oh, why don't you pick.\\
184 - Okay, how about comedy?\\
185 - Eh, I already laughed today.\\
186 - I know.\\
187 - It was when I stubbed my toe.\\
188 - (chuckles)\\
189 - Still funny.\\
190 - Drama?\\
191 - Nah, I've already seen someone cry today.\\
192 - It really hurt, Sheldon!\\
193 - (knock on door)\\
194 - Hey.\\
195 - We talked to Colonel Williams.\\
196 - He told us everything.\\
197 - I'm sorry, can we do this another time?\\
198 - Amy's just about to realize she wants to watch a Hulk marathon.\\
199 - What's going on?\\
200 - Sheldon went to the Air Force behind our backs.\\
201 - I did nothing of the sort.\\
202 - I had an idea     for a neutrino-based communication system,     I presented it to them, and they were interested.\\
203 - But y-your communication system     was based on our guidance system.\\
204 - And sonar is based on bats.\\
205 - You don't see them hanging upside down     in a patent attorney's office.\\
206 - You know what, you like to think that you're just like Tesla,     but the truth is you're exactly like Edison.\\
207 - You take that back.\\
208 - No, he's right.\\
209 - You are a bully, a credit hog and a self-promoter.\\
210 - And if anyone around here is like Tesla, it's us.\\
211 - Yeah.\\
212 - Can you believe they said I was just like Edison?\\
213 - Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less.\\
214 - Well, you are building on their work     and taking the credit for it.\\
215 - That's a classic Edison move.\\
216 - Oh, yeah?\\
217 - Well, if I'm Edison and you love me,     then what does that say about you?\\
218 - I honestly don't know.\\
219 - Okay.\\
220 - Well, I have to Google some stuff about Mrs. Edison.\\
221 - I'll be right back.\\
222 - You know whose fault this is?\\
223 - I do.\\
224 - Yours.\\
225 - No, my mother's.\\
226 - "Go make friends, Sheldon."     What happens?\\
227 - years later, they call me names.\\
228 - I don't think what they called you is the point here.\\
229 - Oh, yeah?\\
230 - How would you feel     if I called you the name of a neuroscientist you didn't like?\\
231 - Do you know the name of any neuroscientist?\\
232 - Of course.\\
233 - Not me?\\
234 - Then no.\\
235 - Do you think they're right, Amy?\\
236 - (stammers)\\
237 - Do you think I'm like Edison?\\
238 - Sheldon, I don't think you're upset     because of what kind of scientist they said you're like.\\
239 - I think you're upset because     your friend' feelings got hurt.\\
240 - You're right.\\
241 - I care too much about other people's feelings.\\
242 - It's always been my fatal flaw.\\
243 - Sheldon, I don't think...\\
244 - No, no, not now, Amy.\\
245 - I'm growing as a person.\\
246 - Ah, that was fun.\\
247 - Put her there, buddy.\\
248 - I am not fist bumping you after we have s*x.\\
249 - You're the one who wanted to keep things casual.\\
250 - There's a difference between casual and weird.\\
251 - Not the way I do it.\\
252 - So, um... how was, how was your day?\\
253 - Like, how's-how's work?\\
254 - Oh, great.\\
255 - With Bernadette gone,     I'm getting to handle all her projects.\\
256 - Well, she's-she's not gone.\\
257 - She'll be back soon.\\
258 - Not too soon, let's hope.\\
259 - So it turns out Ruchi is totally     trying to take over Bernadette's projects.\\
260 - Wow, she just told you that out of the blue?\\
261 - Yeah, yeah, we had just made love.\\
262 - It was so beautiful.\\
263 - Our caramel-colored bodies     were entwined like erotic taffy...\\
264 - Get to the point!\\
265 - Oh.\\
266 - Uh, sorry, uh, yeah.\\
267 - I-I asked her about work, and she just admitted     she has her eyes on Bernadette's projects.\\
268 - Can't believe she would take advantage     of a pregnant lady like that.\\
269 - So what did you do?\\
270 - What do you think I did?\\
271 - I made small talk for    minutes and had s*x again.\\
272 - You have to say something to Bernie.\\
273 - I don't know.\\
274 - If I do that, she's gonna confront Ruchi,     and then Ruchi's gonna stop sleeping with me.\\
275 - Raj, you can't go on sleeping with a woman     who's trying to screw over your friend.\\
276 - Can't or must?\\
277 - You know, that guidance system was my idea.\\
278 - You figured out how to make it work.\\
279 - We didn't even need Sheldon.\\
280 - Let's not forget your idea was based on my theory.\\
281 - Hey, we're bagging on Sheldon here!\\
282 - Focus!\\
283 - I guess it was pretty smart using our quantum technology     as the basis for a communication system.\\
284 - Be even better if he swapped out the helium for xenon.\\
285 - Ooh.\\
286 - So instead of having to keep it at negative     degrees,     you'd only have to keep it at negative    .\\
287 - It would be way more efficient.\\
288 - And xenon has a bigger nucleus,     so coherence would make it an easier signal to see.\\
289 - You're brilliant!\\
290 - We should tell Sheldon.\\
291 - You're an idiot!\\
292 - We don't tell Sheldon.\\
293 - We go to the military behind his back     and we screw him like he screwed us.\\
294 - All right, you're right, you're right, we don't need him.\\
295 - We can do this all on our own.\\
296 - Do you think you can do the math?\\
297 - No.\\
298 - But if someone else does it,     I can double check the crap out of it.\\
299 - I want you to know, I did what you asked.\\
300 - I talked to Ruchi and found out what's going on at work.\\
301 - So is she trying to steal my projects?\\
302 - No, not trying to, sounds like it's a done deal.\\
303 - Here, have a brownie.\\
304 - I'm gonna kill her.\\
305 - Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi.\\
306 - Is she trying to take your job?\\
307 - Yes.\\
308 - Is she parking in your space?\\
309 - Yes.\\
310 - Did she get a laugh at a meeting yesterday     by calling you "Pregnadette"?\\
311 - Big one.\\
312 - But you would've done the exact same thing, and you know it.\\
313 - I never would've undermined a coworker.\\
314 - What?\\
315 - Oh, please.\\
316 - Wh-What about that guy Eric,     who you told it was "Bring Your Cat to Work Day"     when you knew your boss had asthma?\\
317 - That was just a hilarious prank     that ended with me getting a corner office.\\
318 - All I'm saying is     before you attack Ruchi, maybe you should     take a long hard look in the mirror,     because you know what you'll see--     apart from radiant skin and luxuriously thick hair?\\
319 - Hypocrisy!\\
320 - It is thick.\\
321 - So what do you think?\\
322 - Can you make it work?\\
323 - Uh, I just need to use the cross section     to calculate the probability of the interaction.\\
324 - Can we help?\\
325 - Yes.\\
326 - Why don't you run get me a can of Pringles.\\
327 - Leonard, I was--     What's Kripke doing here?\\
328 - Oh, he's just helping us develop a better, more efficient     neutrino comm system that we're gonna pitch to the military,     making yours obsolete.\\
329 - WOLOWITZ: Yeah, Leonard thought of it.\\
330 - It's genius.\\
331 - Oh, thanks.\\
332 - You see, instead of using liquid helium...\\
333 - Good God, man, shut up!\\
334 - Right, sorry.\\
335 - KRIPKE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
336 - You didn't tell me we were doing this     just to stick it to Sheldon.\\
337 - Oh, well...\\
338 - I messing with you.\\
339 - This sundae just got a cherry on top!\\
340 - Fine.\\
341 - Good luck to you.\\
342 - The military is already interested in my system,     and my math is worked out.\\
343 - His still has a big gap in it.\\
344 - Where?\\
345 - There.\\
346 - - - Can I ask you a question?\\
347 - Mm?\\
348 - Does a drug still count as an antidepressant     if its number one side effect is uncontrollable weeping?\\
349 - I don't know.\\
350 - I always feel better after a good cry.\\
351 - I've been trying to ask Bernadette,     but she's not answering any of my texts.\\
352 - Yeah, uh, listen, I think she might be     a little threatened by you, you know,     because you can tie your own shoes and laugh without peeing.\\
353 - Did she say something to you?\\
354 - No.\\
355 - I mean, well, kind of.\\
356 - But it's okay.\\
357 - She's just hormonal.\\
358 - And, you know, don't worry, I stood up for you.\\
359 - I don't need you to stand up for me.\\
360 - You're not my boyfriend.\\
361 - Look, I care about you,     and you can say that this doesn't mean anything,     but the truth is we're in a relationship, okay?\\
362 - And you're gonna have to figure out some way to deal with it.\\
363 - I can't believe she dumped me.\\
364 - This is tough for me, 'cause I can.\\
365 - Sorry things worked out like that.\\
366 - Because I'm in pain or because you don't have a spy anymore?\\
367 - Let's just leave it at "I'm sorry."     You're already sad.\\
368 - Based on Kripke's calculations,     I think this is gonna work.\\
369 - Maybe we should pitch it to Colonel Williams today.\\
370 - Why limit ourselves to the U.S. military?\\
371 - I bet there's a lot of other places we could take this.\\
372 - Without committing criminal espionage?\\
373 - You know, it's easy to shoot an idea down, Leonard.\\
374 - Well, I suppose congratulations are in order.\\
375 - You set out to destroy me, and you achieved your goal.\\
376 - What are you talking about?\\
377 - The military canceled my project,     because they're going with yours.\\
378 - That's impossible.\\
379 - We haven't even pitched it yet.\\
380 - Well, Colonel Williams said another team at Caltech     came up with a more efficient neutrino comm system.\\
381 - Damn it!\\
382 - Excuse us.\\
383 - Kripke.\\
384 - What's up, fellas?\\
385 - Did you screw us over?\\
386 - Ooh, I can't tell you that.\\
387 - It's classified.\\
388 - Why did you tell Barry Kripke your idea?\\
389 - This is all your fault.\\
390 - No, it's your fault.\\
391 - If you would've come to us in the beginning,     none of this would've happened.\\
392 - Well, if it helps, you all behaved terribly     and you deserve what you got.\\
393 - Well, that doesn't help at all.\\
394 - You know, sometimes your social skills are very poor.\\
395 - Can't believe we let Kripke use us like that.\\
396 - You know, maybe you're all more like the guy     who didn't invent the electric car     and less like the guy who didn't invent the lightbulb.\\
397 - She's right.\\
398 - Maybe we're all a bunch of Teslas after all.\\
399 - Didn't Tesla die penniless, forgotten and insane?\\
400 - (sighs)\\
401 - You may have a point about her social skills.\\
402 - He wasn't insane.\\
403 - He did fall in love with a pigeon.\\
404 - Well, if we're gonna call Tesla crazy     for loving something small and unappealing,     might as well put Penny in a padded cell right now.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Bitcoin Entanglement}
1 - Why are they making four more Avatar movies?\\
2 - It's not like the first one is even that good.\\
3 - What are you talking about?\\
4 - You love that movie.\\
5 - You even went as Avatar for Halloween.\\
6 - I remember.\\
7 - That was not a lot of clothes.\\
8 - Hey, guys.\\
9 - - Hey.\\
10 - - Hey.\\
11 - I'm, uh, I'm running a special today, uh,   buy something, keep having a comic book store to come to.\\
12 - This is awkward.\\
13 - I was actually gonna return this.\\
14 - What's wrong with it?\\
15 - I-I finished it.\\
16 - Speaking of something I find interesting,    did anyone read that article about Bitcoin I sent you?\\
17 - Yeah, I can't believe a single Bitcoin    is worth about $ ,    now.\\
18 - Wait, didn't we mine some a few years ago?\\
19 - It was seven years ago.\\
20 - Oh, yeah, I remember that.\\
21 - Really?\\
22 - All I can remember from seven years ago    is I couldn't get Kesha's "Tik Tok" out of my head.\\
23 -  Tik Tok, on the clock...  \\
24 - Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.\\
25 - No, we-we definitely mined some.\\
26 - I-I remember sitting in your bedroom and writing the program.\\
27 - I think we ended up with a bunch of it.\\
28 - Wow, and at, like, $ ,    apiece, that's...\\
29 - Sounds like a lot of money, which we agreed to share    'cause I-I was totally there.\\
30 - I remember now.\\
31 - I can't believe we forgot about it.\\
32 - It's not that surprising.\\
33 - They were basically worthless when we got them.\\
34 - I wish I knew how much we had.\\
35 - Sheldon, you must remember.\\
36 - Of course I do.\\
37 - Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember.\\
38 - You tell them, Sheldon.\\
39 - I can't believe you haven't seen Avatar yet.\\
40 - What is wrong with you?\\
41 - Penny and I just started dating,    and you know I don't like big crowds.\\
42 - Because you're afraid Penny will leave you for someone in them?\\
43 - Terrified.\\
44 - Yes, instead of going out,    they just stay home and have constant coitus.\\
45 - Well, I didn't want to say it, but I-I do like to hear it.\\
46 - Yes, Ma, I'll be home for dinner.\\
47 - No, I'm not ruining my appetite with candy.\\
48 - Oh, we're having brisket?\\
49 - (spits)\\
50 - Be home at  :  .\\
51 - Maybe we should double date.\\
52 - I'll bring Penny and you can bring your mom.\\
53 - Oh, make your jokes,    but my date started a savings account for me.\\
54 - Did yours?\\
55 - Hey, you guys.\\
56 - OTHERS: Hey.\\
57 - Oh, Stuart, good.\\
58 - I was wondering,    will you be accepting Bitcoin?\\
59 - Well, I don't know what that is, but it's got "coin" in it,    and my cash register doesn't, so...\\
60 - yeah.\\
61 - Wait, what's Bitcoin?\\
62 - It's a new online currency that's been developed.\\
63 - Uh, it's just like actual money,    except you can't see it, hold it, or spend it on anything.\\
64 - Sounds like the kind of money I'm familiar with.\\
65 - If it's not tangible, how do you know    it's not just gonna vanish tomorrow?\\
66 - Really?\\
67 - You're dating Penny, and you're gonna poke at something    that could vanish tomorrow?\\
68 - I'll buy some Bitcoin.\\
69 - I just came into a little extra money    when my dad raised my allowance.\\
70 - You don't have to buy Bitcoin.\\
71 - You can mine it.\\
72 - Mine it?\\
73 - Like, mining gold?\\
74 - Sort of.\\
75 - There's a limited amount,    and we find it, not by tunneling into the earth,    but by using a computer to solve complex mathematical problems.\\
76 - So let me get this straight.\\
77 - We have to write an elaborate program    in order to find a fake coin that we can't spend on anything?\\
78 - Yes.\\
79 - That sounds fun.\\
80 - Yeah, I'm in.\\
81 - LEONARD: Staying up late,    writing code, it sounds like a party.\\
82 - Hey, Stuart.\\
83 - You want to mine some Bitcoin with us?\\
84 - We'll write the program, you bring the snacks?\\
85 - Too rich for my blood.\\
86 - All right, so just the four of us.\\
87 - Before we begin,    this may have some unprecedented tax implications.\\
88 - In fact, we should start early 'cause we are gonna be    on the phone with the IRS for hours.\\
89 - (gasps)\\
90 - Did anybody else just get goose bumps?\\
91 - Great, so just the three of us.\\
92 - Oh, yeah.\\
93 - We did it without you.\\
94 - And do you remember what happened next?\\
95 - Your mom called my mom and said we were being mean?\\
96 - And after that?\\
97 - You said that someday we'd regret this.\\
98 - And do you know     what today is?\\
99 - The day we found out we're rich and none of it is yours?\\
100 - (laughter, whooping)\\
101 - Yeah, that's right!\\
102 - Up top!\\
103 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
104 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
105 -  The Earth began to cool \\
106 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
107 -  We built the Wall \\
108 -  We built the pyramids \\
109 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
110 -  That all started with a big bang \\
111 -  Bang! \\
112 - Okay, this is the laptop     I was using in     .\\
113 - The Bitcoin must be on here.\\
114 - So what are you gonna do with your share of the money?\\
115 - Uh, well, as a responsible adult,     I'll put that money into a CD, wait for that CD to mature,     and then buy a tiger.\\
116 - How about you?\\
117 - Oh, that depends on     whether I tell Bernadette or not.\\
118 - BERNADETTE: Howard, I can hear you.\\
119 - The baby monitor is on.\\
120 - I know.\\
121 - I was joking.\\
122 - I'm gonna put it     in a college fund.\\
123 - All right, all booted up.\\
124 - Wow, I-I knew you were single back then,     but that is a lot of p0rn...\\
125 - Science!\\
126 - A lot of science.\\
127 - Wow, you were really into Asian science.\\
128 - I don't see the Bitcoin on here.\\
129 - Hey, maybe it's in that folder marked     "Private and Confidential."     BERNADETTE: It's not!\\
130 - Okay, the program is almost ready to run.\\
131 - Mining for coins sounds so manly.\\
132 - Ooh, we should sing a mining song.\\
133 - Do you know a mining song?\\
134 - I don't know.\\
135 - Does "Tik Tok" by Kesha count?\\
136 - Because it has tunneled its way into my heart.\\
137 - MRS.\\
138 - WOLOWITZ: Howard, what's going on?!\\
139 - Are you boys roughhousing?!\\
140 - No, we're not roughhousing!\\
141 - We're scientists!\\
142 - Scientists don't roughhouse!\\
143 - MRS.\\
144 - WOLOWITZ: Excuse me, Mr.\\
145 - Grown-up.\\
146 - Aw, man, what happened?\\
147 - It crashed.\\
148 - It's been doing that lately.\\
149 - I think it's got a virus from all the...\\
150 - music I've been downloading.\\
151 - What kind of music?\\
152 - Mostly Asian.\\
153 - Some oldies.\\
154 - Well, we can use my laptop.\\
155 - MRS.\\
156 - WOLOWITZ: Howard, I made cookies     for you and your little friends!\\
157 - They're not my little friends, and we don't want cookies!\\
158 - Actually, a cookie sounds good.\\
159 - All right, we'll have cookies!\\
160 - Thank you very much!\\
161 - That's right.\\
162 - It must be on my old laptop.\\
163 - Well, let's go.\\
164 - Hey, Bernie, you mind if I run to Leonard's and...\\
165 - BERNADETTE: Get a laptop full of money?\\
166 - Why are you still here?!\\
167 - Go, go, go!\\
168 - So, how's the wedding planning going?\\
169 - Great.\\
170 - Although, we're having trouble agreeing on a location.\\
171 - I thought you were looking at a cliff on the beach.\\
172 - We were, but Sheldon didn't like any of them.\\
173 - Some were too beachy, some were too cliffy.\\
174 - And all of them were too outsidey.\\
175 - Well, weddings aren't about the location.\\
176 - They're about standing up in front of your family and friends     and promising that Sheldon will never move back in here.\\
177 - Hi.\\
178 - PENNY: Hey.\\
179 - What are you guys doing?\\
180 - Uh, we have a bunch of Bitcoin on an old laptop,     and it could be worth, like, a lot of money.\\
181 - What-- You're kidding.\\
182 - No.\\
183 - We-we could be sitting on a fortune.\\
184 - Okay, let the record show, I did not marry you for money,     but you just got way more attractive.\\
185 - Damn it, it's not in here.\\
186 - If only you had someone around with an eidetic memory.\\
187 - I bet they would know what happened to it.\\
188 - If you know, just tell us.\\
189 - Excuse me, but if I recall from seven years ago,     you don't want me to be a part of this.\\
190 - Sheldon, you can't still be mad.\\
191 - Oh, please.\\
192 - I have grudges that go back to preschool.\\
193 - Someday, I'm gonna find a grown-up Elaine Dwyer     and eat her favorite crayon while she watches.\\
194 - Is that why there's an Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?\\
195 - Yes.\\
196 - That night, I'm going to have the first dance     and the last laugh.\\
197 - Sheldon, please.\\
198 - Should I be the bigger man?\\
199 - I think you should.\\
200 - (snorts)\\
201 - Oh, why'd I ask you?\\
202 - Hey there, pretty lady.\\
203 - I'm not waiting on your table for you.\\
204 - Come on, this one is so annoying.\\
205 - Excuse me, waitress.\\
206 - You guys ready to order?\\
207 - Can you take our picture, please?\\
208 - Oh, sure.\\
209 - Smile!\\
210 - Perfect.\\
211 - Thank you.\\
212 - You may go now.\\
213 - It was nice to meet you,     and I mean that politely, not sincerely.\\
214 - What was that?\\
215 - I need to prove to my mother that I'm on a date.\\
216 - If she thinks I faked the picture,     I might need you as a witness.\\
217 - What's your name?\\
218 - Bernadette.\\
219 - PENNY: Hey, sweetie.\\
220 - Hey.\\
221 - Everybody good?\\
222 - - Yeah.\\
223 - - Fine.\\
224 - - Sure.\\
225 - You don't have to whisper, you can just nod your head.\\
226 - Or you could just speak.\\
227 - You having a good day?\\
228 - No, I missed an audition     because my computer broke, and I didn't get the e-mail.\\
229 - Would've been a perfect part for me.\\
230 - Was it waitress who ignores her customers?\\
231 - Because that's the role you were born to play.\\
232 - Shut up and eat your burger.\\
233 - Actually, it's a turkey club.\\
234 - Didn't you order a burger?\\
235 - I did, and yet here we are.\\
236 - You know what, if you need a computer,     you can use my laptop.\\
237 - Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not gonna take your computer.\\
238 - Oh, it's fine.\\
239 - I-I'm getting a new one anyway.\\
240 - Are you sure?\\
241 - SHELDON: Don't be silly.\\
242 - He's desperate to hold on to you.\\
243 - You can get anything out of him.\\
244 - His car, his watch...\\
245 - Maybe a kidney.\\
246 - You already have his testicles.\\
247 - You can start a collection.\\
248 - Oh, my God, that's right.\\
249 - You gave me your laptop.\\
250 - That was so sweet.\\
251 - So you know where it is?\\
252 - Of course.\\
253 - - All right!\\
254 - - Yes!\\
255 - - Great!\\
256 - I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.\\
257 - - Come on!\\
258 - - Why?!\\
259 - - No!\\
260 - PENNY: Okay, Zack, thank you so much.\\
261 - We'll be right over.\\
262 - He still has it.\\
263 - I can't believe you took a gift from me     and gave it to another man.\\
264 - SHELDON: Really?\\
265 - Of all the things she's given to other men,     that's what you're concerned about?\\
266 - Please don't make a big deal about this.\\
267 - It was a long time ago, we were broken up.\\
268 - Which breakup was that?\\
269 - Was that the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?\\
270 - No, no.\\
271 - This might've been during the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.\\
272 - You have names for our breakups?\\
273 - Well, they would really blur together if we didn't.\\
274 - The Comic-Con breakup's easy to remember     because Leonard was the saddest Pikachu.\\
275 - Right, and he wiped his nose on your cape,     and then you were the saddest Darth Vader.\\
276 - You know, Penny and I aren't the only ones who've broken up.\\
277 - So did Howard and Bernadette.\\
278 - Uh, not to brag, but all my breakups have lasted.\\
279 - I'm so sorry to hear about you and Howard.\\
280 - Thanks.\\
281 - I just didn't think he was     the kind of guy who would be doing weird stuff online.\\
282 - Really?\\
283 - Wow, I thought it was so obvious, but okay.\\
284 - Look, I know it's hard, but I think the best thing     to do after a breakup is to take some time     and be by yourself.\\
285 - Yeah, that's healthy.\\
286 - Hey, babe, ready to go?\\
287 - Do as I say, not as I do.\\
288 - I cannot believe you're mad.\\
289 - I'm not mad.\\
290 - Oh, really?\\
291 - Tell that to your eyebrows.\\
292 - Bet I could place a quarter between them,     and it would just stay there.\\
293 - Fine, I'm mad.\\
294 - I guess I was more upset by our breakup than you.\\
295 - That is not true.\\
296 - Of course I was upset.\\
297 - Didn't seem like it.\\
298 - You started dating the first     tall, handsome hunk you could find.\\
299 - I'm sorry,     are you mad that I dated Zack or that you didn't?\\
300 - - Hi.\\
301 - - Hi.\\
302 - - Hey, Zack.\\
303 - So good to see you guys.\\
304 - Man, we should do this more often.\\
305 - Come over to get laptops back from you?\\
306 - Totally.\\
307 - So do you have it?\\
308 - Of course I do.\\
309 - Penny gave it to me as a gift.\\
310 - You don't get rid of something like that.\\
311 - Huh.\\
312 - All right, I'm sorry I gave away your stupid laptop.\\
313 - You should be.\\
314 - We were broken up for, like, five minutes.\\
315 - Are you guys fighting?\\
316 - Yeah.\\
317 - No.\\
318 - Are you fighting about     whether or not you're fighting?\\
319 - 'Cause I've had that fight before.\\
320 - Turns out we were, and I lost.\\
321 - Leonard thinks when we broke up, it didn't bother me.\\
322 - ZACK: That's crazy.\\
323 - When we were going out, she used to talk about you all the time.\\
324 - In fact, I think she only dated me     because I reminded her of you.\\
325 - Sure.\\
326 - Because we're both...\\
327 - people?\\
328 - Damn right we are.\\
329 - Oh, also, there was that video about how much she missed you.\\
330 - What video?\\
331 - The one on the laptop.\\
332 - I didn't mean to invade your privacy, but I am a huge snoop.\\
333 - Ask my neighbor.\\
334 - She'll tell you.\\
335 - But not right now; she's in the shower.\\
336 - (clears throat)\\
337 - (slurring): Hello, Leonard.\\
338 - I was gonna write you an e-mail, but I'm a little drunk,     and spelling is a sober person's game, so...\\
339 - I feel I owe you a 'splanation.\\
340 - I-- I'm sorry.\\
341 - A 'splanation.\\
342 - (knock on door)\\
343 - SHELDON: Penny.\\
344 - (knocking)\\
345 - Penny.\\
346 - (knocking)\\
347 - Penny.\\
348 - Sheldon, go away.\\
349 - I'm making a video.\\
350 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
351 - I'll come back when you're alone.\\
352 - No, no, no.\\
353 - I am alone.\\
354 - I'm just telling Leonard why I broke up with him.\\
355 - Oh, he knows.\\
356 - The video I want to see     is why you went out with him in the first place.\\
357 - I went out with him because he's great.\\
358 - And if I kept going out with him,     I probably would've married him,     and that's a little scary     because I just don't think I'm ready for that.\\
359 - You know, plus I have got to learn how to spell Hofstadter.\\
360 - I-I know there's a "D" in there,     but it keeps moving every time I try and write it.\\
361 - Sheldon, what do I do?\\
362 - Try to pass out facedown, so you don't choke on your vomit.\\
363 - I am not gonna pass out.\\
364 - But thank you anyway.\\
365 - Wow.\\
366 - I know.\\
367 - There's, like, two more hours of her just lying there.\\
368 - Aw, you love me so much.\\
369 - I married you, jackass.\\
370 - I...\\
371 - I know, and not just out of pity     like everyone said in their wedding toast.\\
372 - You want to see the part where she falls off the chair?\\
373 - No.\\
374 - Totally.\\
375 - (thud)\\
376 - That's my wife.\\
377 - I got to see that again.\\
378 - Got the laptop.\\
379 - Hand it here.\\
380 - Oh, this is so exciting!\\
381 - Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin, are you gonna pay your dad back     all the money you took from him over the years?\\
382 - Never even crossed my mind.\\
383 - Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.\\
384 - Yeah, how much is in there?\\
385 - It's empty.\\
386 - What?\\
387 - Th-That's impossible.\\
388 - (stammers)\\
389 - Do you think Zack stole it?\\
390 - No, he doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin.\\
391 - I mean, he waves at trucks.\\
392 - Hmm...\\
393 - who could it have been?\\
394 - Sheldon, what did you do?\\
395 - I plotted my revenge.\\
396 - If you get a dish, I'll serve you some cold.\\
397 - What, y-you stole our Bitcoin?\\
398 - Oh, calm down.\\
399 - All I did was sneak onto your computer     and download your Bitcoin onto a flash drive.\\
400 - What?\\
401 - I'm not keeping it.\\
402 - I just wanted to watch you sweat.\\
403 - If you want to watch him sweat,     walk up a flight of stairs with him.\\
404 - I've waited seven long years, but it finally happened.\\
405 - Where's our money?\\
406 - That's the best part.\\
407 - It's on the Batman flash drive on your key chain.\\
408 - You've had it in your pocket all along.\\
409 - Sheldon...\\
410 - I lost that key chain years ago.\\
411 - Really?\\
412 - D-D-Did you look under things?\\
413 - Well, that is unfortunate.\\
414 - I guess we've all learned a lesson today.\\
415 - What was the lesson?\\
416 - I don't know.\\
417 - STUART: Huh. What's that? Ooh, Batman flash drive. Pretty cool. Huh, if I erase this, I could probably resell it for, like, ten bucks. Things are finally going my way.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Confidence Erosion}
1 - This was a good idea.\\
2 - It's been a long time since we've had girls' night.\\
3 - Yeah, it's so nice to have a relaxing evening   at home doing nothing.\\
4 - Yeah, really breaks up the other    days   I've spent on bed rest doing nothing.\\
5 - Well, tonight we're gonna make you forget all that.\\
6 - You're gonna make me forget I've been stuck in bed   while a baby uses my bladder as a kickball?\\
7 - (knocking)\\
8 - Hey, you had unprotected s*x with Howard.\\
9 - You deserve to be miserable.\\
10 - Hey, I need some fashion advice.\\
11 - Really?\\
12 - From me?\\
13 - I would love to...\\
14 - Actually, Leonard told me Penny was over here?\\
15 - Hey, what's going on?\\
16 - You got a date?\\
17 - I, uh, do have a date...\\
18 - with science.\\
19 - Oh, what's science wearing?\\
20 - The Griffith Observatory is looking for an astrophysicist    to consult, and I have an interview tomorrow.\\
21 - Oh, I love the observatory.\\
22 - They tell you your weight on all the different planets.\\
23 - Yeah.\\
24 - It's always bikini season on Venus.\\
25 - I think you'd be great at that.\\
26 - Don't you agree, Bernadette?\\
27 - Huh?\\
28 - I'm listening.\\
29 - I'm listening.\\
30 - I'm not watching The Crown.    I just want to make a good first impression,    and thought maybe you could help me pick out an outfit?\\
31 - Of course.\\
32 - Let's see what you got.\\
33 - Yeah, you just need to pick something    that-that you feel confident in.\\
34 - I'm sorry.\\
35 - I left my magic clothes at home.\\
36 - I'm sure these two options will be f...\\
37 - So you-you have other clothes at home?\\
38 - Uh, it doesn't matter.\\
39 - They're talking to a bunch of people.\\
40 - I probably won't get it anyway.\\
41 - Well, don't say that.\\
42 - Yeah, you have to believe in yourself.\\
43 - You know, before I came to America,    I was filled with confidence.\\
44 - What happened to me?\\
45 - Hey, is that Raj there at girls' night?\\
46 - Well, hey.\\
47 - Hey, Howard.\\
48 - Just remember, if you fall asleep first,    they're gonna freeze your bra.\\
49 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
50 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
51 -  The Earth began to cool \\
52 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
53 -  We built the Wall \\
54 -  We built the pyramids \\
55 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
56 -  That all started with a big bang \\
57 -  Bang! \\
58 - You and Amy having fun planning your wedding?\\
59 - We're employing a mathematical approach    called decision theory, so, heck, yeah.\\
60 - Heck, yeah?\\
61 - Looks like someone need to put a dollar in the almost-swear jar.\\
62 - We've assigned all wedding decisions randomly,    and each of us makes half of them.\\
63 - You know, from venue to officiant    to numbering system for the tables: Roman or Dewey Decimal.\\
64 - Why not hexadecimal?\\
65 - 'Cause this is our wedding, not a joke.\\
66 - - Hey, guys.\\
67 - - Hello.\\
68 - - Hey.\\
69 - Oh, good.\\
70 - Raj is here    to tell us today's specials.\\
71 - Very funny.\\
72 - I have my interview this afternoon.\\
73 - Oh.\\
74 - If it doesn't work out,    you're ready to go on your Mormon mission.\\
75 - I-I don't understand what's going on here.\\
76 - Oh, what's going on here is    I'm up for a job at the planetarium,    and Howard is making fun of me.\\
77 - Oh, that's great.\\
78 - You're both doing what you love.\\
79 - Well, I'm excited for you.\\
80 - Oh, thanks, yeah.\\
81 - I'd be in charge of developing    and narrating all the planetarium shows.\\
82 - And I really want this,    so it wouldn't kill you to be more supportive.\\
83 - But if it did, you could bury me at the funeral home you direct.\\
84 - Wait.\\
85 - The premise is that he is dressed differently?\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - (laughing): That's true.\\
88 - He is not dressed the same.\\
89 - (Skype tones sound)\\
90 - Hey, Dad.\\
91 - Hello, Rajesh.\\
92 - How was the interview?\\
93 - Uh, not so great.\\
94 - They asked me what my biggest weakness was,    and    minutes later, they thanked me for coming.\\
95 - Son, don't take this the wrong way, but what's your problem?\\
96 - I would tell you, but apparently it takes    minutes.\\
97 - You know what?\\
98 - I bet it's those friends you surround yourself with.\\
99 - Like that Howard, always making fun of you.\\
100 - Howard doesn't mean anything by it.\\
101 - I-I think it's cultural.\\
102 - His people come from a very sarcastic village     called Brooklyn.\\
103 - Don't make excuses.\\
104 - What kind of friend acts that way?\\
105 - Well, I-I guess...\\
106 - It was a rhetorical question.\\
107 - A bad friend!\\
108 - Come on, Dad!\\
109 - That's just our relationship, okay?\\
110 - He makes Indian jokes, and I laugh,     but, you know, with angry eyes so he knows it's not okay.\\
111 - I, too, was in a relationship     with someone who made me feel bad about myself.\\
112 - If you're talking about Mom, I don't want to hear it.\\
113 - I'm just saying, if you replace Howard     with a nice   -year-old grad student,     your self-confidence will soar.\\
114 - All right, Amy, you're up.\\
115 - Next decision.\\
116 - AMY: Come on, first dance!\\
117 - Come on, first dance!\\
118 - (ding)\\
119 - Invitations!\\
120 - Oh!\\
121 - That's a good one.\\
122 - Just a suggestion--     hologram projected out of R -D .\\
123 - Thanks for your input, but this is my decision,     and I'm gonna go with...\\
124 - Old English calligraphy on Egyptian papyrus.\\
125 - Oh, what a fun mashup.\\
126 - It's like the chicken and waffles of orthography.\\
127 - Your turn.\\
128 - (rhythmic clicking)\\
129 - (ding)\\
130 - Ring bearer!\\
131 - Oh.\\
132 - Boy, I'm so glad that R -D  is still available.\\
133 - You know, this is really fun.\\
134 - I can't believe that people say that planning a wedding is one     of the most stressful things in life.\\
135 - I know.\\
136 - Not a day goes by that I don't marvel     how much better we are than other people.\\
137 - I'm so sorry the interview didn't go well.\\
138 - Yeah, you would've been perfect for it.\\
139 - Oh, I just get so nervous,     and then I start apologizing for being nervous, and...\\
140 - You guys don't want to hear about this.\\
141 - I'm sorry.\\
142 - Stop apologizing!\\
143 - Oh, my God!\\
144 - You sound just like the woman at the interview!\\
145 - Have you ever thought about talking     to some kind of therapist about all this?\\
146 - Ugh.\\
147 - Maybe.\\
148 - Hey, Leonard, do you think your mom would be available?\\
149 - Yeah, you don't want to do that.\\
150 - Talking to my mom     to get more confidence is like talking to a lion     to get more alive.\\
151 - Well, my dad thinks     it's because Howard's always making fun of me.\\
152 - Well, that makes sense.\\
153 - Well, what do you mean, that makes sense?\\
154 - Well, Howard does make fun of him a lot.\\
155 - Well, that's not all Howard's fault.\\
156 - I mean, if Raj doesn't want to be made fun of, then I...\\
157 - Hmm.\\
158 - I don't know a nice way to finish this sentence.\\
159 - Well, so you're on his side?\\
160 - I'm just saying,     that's what friends do.\\
161 - You know, they bust on each other.\\
162 - It doesn't mean anything.\\
163 - Well, I'm not surprised you think so.\\
164 - Why is that?\\
165 - Well, you can be kind of mean to me.\\
166 - Well, that's because you're...\\
167 - Wow.\\
168 - I don't know how to finish that sentence, either.\\
169 - You know what?\\
170 - I think we're both done being disrespected.\\
171 - I got a few rounds left in me.\\
172 - Attaboy, champ.\\
173 - Okay, let's see what we've got so far.\\
174 - I arrive in a Little House on the Prairie style     horse-drawn buggy.\\
175 - Where you are met with an honor guard of stormtroopers.\\
176 - Do you think that might be jarring,     going from wholesome pioneers to space Nazis?\\
177 - I see what you're saying.\\
178 - You're thinking that you should arrive     in a replica of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder.\\
179 - It's not what I'm thinking,     and to save you     the trouble for the future,     it will never be what I'm thinking.\\
180 - Well...\\
181 - if the ushers are so important to you,     what if I propose a trade?\\
182 - You may pick that, and I will decide, say, first dance.\\
183 - Great.\\
184 - Then the ushers will be...\\
185 - my cousins     dressed in frontier frock coats.\\
186 - Oh.\\
187 - And the first dance will be that we won't have one.\\
188 - All right.\\
189 - Then our...\\
190 - second dance will be the first dance.\\
191 - Unless we have no dance at all.\\
192 - Ha-ha.\\
193 - Well, if we're changing things,     then instead of throwing confetti,     we'll release butterflies.\\
194 - Airborne worms?!\\
195 - Have you lost your mind?!\\
196 - Well, if you're going to do that,     then I am changing the officiant     to that husky Spider-Man     that hangs out at the Chinese Theater.\\
197 - Fine.\\
198 - Wedding toasts in Latin.\\
199 - Great.\\
200 - Vows in Klingon.\\
201 - Then I'm changing the flower girl to a dog.\\
202 - And guess what he'll be scattering instead of petals!\\
203 - (knocking)\\
204 - Want to grab some lunch?\\
205 - You know what?\\
206 - I don't think so.\\
207 - Well, let me guess.\\
208 - You're not eating     because the mean girls circled your chubby bits in marker?\\
209 - No.\\
210 - That.\\
211 - That right there.\\
212 - That's the reason.\\
213 - You're always making fun of me.\\
214 - (laughing): Oh, those are just jokes.\\
215 - It's my way     of saying that we're friends,     and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few!\\
216 - See?\\
217 - No wonder I don't have any confidence.\\
218 - Come on.\\
219 - You can't blame that on me.\\
220 - Why not?\\
221 - years of constant ridicule.\\
222 - I-I think     our relationship has become toxic.\\
223 - Uh, what are you saying?\\
224 - I think you and I need to spend some time away from each other.\\
225 - Look, I...\\
226 - I can see you're upset, but...\\
227 - I'm gonna need some ground rules.\\
228 - I mean,     while we're apart, can I see other needy Indian men?\\
229 - Get out!\\
230 - What do you think will make     the wedding worse for Amy:     a cake made with salt instead of sugar...\\
231 - ...or a cake iced with congealed gravy?\\
232 - That is a trick question.\\
233 - The answer is: you as the groom.\\
234 - Neither of them will be the actual cake.\\
235 - I'm just using it as a bargaining chip     to get Amy to agree to the whole wedding party getting rings     and us getting one ring to rule them all.\\
236 - I forget, which mental hospital are you guys registered at?\\
237 - Hello.\\
238 - - Hello.\\
239 - - Hello.\\
240 - - Hello.\\
241 - Really?\\
242 - You're not gonna sit here?\\
243 - I'll sit there as soon as you leave.\\
244 - You're still on this?\\
245 - I said sorry.\\
246 - Well, "sorry" doesn't make up for years of emotional abuse.\\
247 - (sighs)\\
248 - Well, what's it gonna take?\\
249 - You want half my sandwich?\\
250 - What is going on?\\
251 - Raj is trying to blame me for his pathetic life.\\
252 - His life isn't pathetic.\\
253 - He's got that whole table to himself.\\
254 - One of us should go sit with Raj so he's not alone.\\
255 - But I'm not done telling you about my wedding revenge plans.\\
256 - You're right.\\
257 - Go on.\\
258 - Okay, well, first, I'm going to try     to get Amy to trade with me for hors d'oeuvres...\\
259 - Oh, good, you're here.\\
260 - I've decided on our centerpieces.\\
261 - I just hope your family isn't allergic to asbestos.\\
262 - Sheldon, please stop.\\
263 - If we keep doing this, we're gonna end up with a wedding     that neither one of us will enjoy.\\
264 - Are you saying you don't want to get married?\\
265 - No, of course I do.\\
266 - But that seems to be the one thing we can agree on.\\
267 - Maybe we should just get married at City Hall     and forget about everything else.\\
268 - City Hall, hmm.\\
269 - I do like metal detectors     and the sound of permits being denied.\\
270 - Right.\\
271 - And if we're not enjoying planning this wedding,     then what's the point?\\
272 - Well, historically, a wedding was to let     other potential suitors know that we're unavailable.\\
273 - But I think matching T-shirts that say     "Hands off the merchandise" accomplish the same thing.\\
274 - So let's pick a day and just go do it.\\
275 - How 'bout tomorrow?\\
276 - R-Really?\\
277 - That soon?\\
278 - Why wait?\\
279 - I mean, it's not that I think we're living in sin,     but I do like the idea that our next act of intimacy     will be a legal requirement.\\
280 - Tomorrow we'll go downtown and get married.\\
281 - Or we could go to Beverly Hills City Hall     if you want a destination wedding.\\
282 - Hey.\\
283 - You look good today.\\
284 - What happened?\\
285 - What's wrong?\\
286 - Just tell me.\\
287 - I can take it.\\
288 - Nothing.\\
289 - I felt bad about being mean to you,     so I'm being nice.\\
290 - Oh, okay.\\
291 - Sorry.\\
292 - I wasn't ready for it.\\
293 - Try again.\\
294 - You look handsome.\\
295 - Nope, still freaking me out.\\
296 - Hello, friends!\\
297 - PENNY AND LEONARD: Hey.\\
298 - Hey, what's going on with your hair?\\
299 - Uh, nothing.\\
300 - I just decided to stop straightening it.\\
301 - Wait, so you were making your hair look like that on purpose?\\
302 - When I first moved to America, I wanted to fit in.\\
303 - And Howard's hair was straight,     and he was the coolest person I knew.\\
304 - Then you never saw any other people?\\
305 - You know what, I-I don't want to talk about Howard.\\
306 - I came here to celebrate!\\
307 - Yeah.\\
308 - I went back to the planetarium and told them     they were making a huge mistake, that I'd be perfect for the job.\\
309 - I was...\\
310 - I was charming, I was confident.\\
311 - And they gave it to me.\\
312 - Wow.\\
313 - (chuckles)\\
314 - That's amazing!\\
315 - Yeah, plus,     it turns out the guy they hired     got busted at a sketchy massage parlor.\\
316 - Oh, so happy ending for you!\\
317 - Oh, and for him.\\
318 - Yeah, I was on my way to tell Howard,     and then I remembered I wasn't speaking to him,     so I came over here.\\
319 - Mm, don't you think it's time you two made up?\\
320 - No.\\
321 - No, actually.\\
322 - I don't need his negative energy     in my life right now.\\
323 - Standing up to him was-was hard,     but it made me realize that I can do anything.\\
324 - And, yeah, it's a little sad, but, you know,     life is all about...\\
325 - (cork pops)\\
326 - Uh, sorry.\\
327 - I thought you were wrapping things up.\\
328 - Hey, Howard.\\
329 - Hey.\\
330 - Where is everybody?\\
331 - I could ask you the same question.\\
332 - Wow, this conversation got mean fast.\\
333 - Sorry.\\
334 - I'm just in a bad mood.\\
335 - Yeah?\\
336 - What's going on?\\
337 - I had a falling out with Raj.\\
338 - He said I make fun of him too much     and it's wrecked his confidence.\\
339 - Please, confidence is like red blood cells--     it's nice if you got some, but you don't need 'em.\\
340 - Yeah.\\
341 - I mean, your life's a mess.\\
342 - I don't see you blaming other people for it.\\
343 - That's right.\\
344 - I grew up in a loving, supportive household.\\
345 - This is all on me.\\
346 - Maybe I'll just hang out here for a while.\\
347 - Great.\\
348 - And you can make fun of me all you want.\\
349 - No, that's okay.\\
350 - No, no, no.\\
351 - Go on.\\
352 - I can take it.\\
353 - My feelings, like my extremities,     are basically numb.\\
354 - Here's your license.\\
355 - Now, if you wait over there,     we'll call you when the officiant's ready.\\
356 - Do we need a blood test?\\
357 - No.\\
358 - Well, then, how will you know whether or not we have syphilis?\\
359 - I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you don't have that.\\
360 - Okay, Sheldon, you officially exceeded the number of times     I hoped to hear the word "syphilis" on my wedding day.\\
361 - I can't believe we're doing this.\\
362 - I know.\\
363 - I'm getting married.\\
364 - The new Star Wars movie's coming out.\\
365 - We are really finishing this year strong.\\
366 - Okay, but of the two of tho...\\
367 - You know, I'm not even gonna ask.\\
368 - I'm not gonna ask.\\
369 - Are you sad we're not having a big party?\\
370 - I'm really not.\\
371 - I'm here with you.\\
372 - It's perfect.\\
373 - Cooper-Fowler?\\
374 - You're up.\\
375 - (chuckles)\\
376 - Can you believe it?\\
377 - We're about to walk in that door, Dr.\\
378 - Cooper and Dr. Fowler,     and walk out as a married couple,     Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler.\\
379 - Wait.\\
380 - I want to have a first dance with you.\\
381 - Right here?\\
382 - At our wedding.\\
383 - Th-This is our wedding.\\
384 - No.\\
385 - I want a real wedding.\\
386 - Well...\\
387 - (sighs)\\
388 - Sheldon, it was just making us fight.\\
389 - I know.\\
390 - But, Amy,     I never thought I'd want to marry anyone.\\
391 - So the fact that I found you is astonishing.\\
392 - It's-it's like finding dark matter,     except they're looking for dark matter.\\
393 - I wasn't even looking for you.\\
394 - S-So you're even better than dark matter.\\
395 - (chuckles)\\
396 - Sheldon.\\
397 - Plus, plus, you interact with light, so I can see you.\\
398 - And, also, you don't account for the missing mass     in the universe.\\
399 - Oh, and...\\
400 - Okay, I think     you're getting caught up on the ways I'm not like dark matter.\\
401 - Right.\\
402 - Sorry.\\
403 - But when you make a discovery like this,     you don't just take it down to City Hall--     you tell the whole world.\\
404 - And so I'll say it in Latin or Klingon     or-or smoke signals,     if-if that's not cultural appropriation.\\
405 - It is.\\
406 - Okay, so not smoke signals.\\
407 - But I want to do this right.\\
408 - (exhales)\\
409 - Me, too.\\
410 - Let's go plan a wedding.\\
411 - You know, we did get dressed up     and come all the way to City Hall.\\
412 - What are you thinking?\\
413 - I have always wanted a permit to dispose of hazardous waste.\\
414 - Let's do it.\\
415 - Do we know if there's life in the methane plumes of Enceladus     or under the icy surface of Europa?\\
416 - Come back on Tuesday for my next show to find out.\\
417 - Spoiler alert: we don't.\\
418 - I'm Dr.\\
419 - Rajesh Koothrappali,     and thank you for taking a walk with me     through the stars.\\
420 - Wow.\\
421 - I never knew science could be so interesting.\\
422 - Hey, I talk to you about science all the time.\\
423 - Oh, you sure do, sweetie.\\
424 - Should we go congratulate him?\\
425 - I'll do better than that-- I'll give him constructive criticism.\\
426 - Here's some constructive criticism: don't.\\
427 - - I'll catch up with you guys.\\
428 - - Okay.\\
429 - Raj, you were terrific!\\
430 - Oh, thank you.\\
431 - I was so nervous,     my armpits are like a swamp.\\
432 - Oh, your hug just got downgraded to a high five.\\
433 - (chuckles)\\
434 - Your palms are sweaty, too.\\
435 - Hey.\\
436 - What are you doing all the way in the back?\\
437 - Hiding out.\\
438 - I wasn't sure if I was welcome.\\
439 - This is ridiculous.\\
440 - You guys are best friends.\\
441 - Of course he wants you here.\\
442 - You sure?\\
443 - He seems to be doing pretty well without me.\\
444 - Look, he was just stressed out.\\
445 - His life is not better without you.\\
446 - Come on.\\
447 - Come say hi.\\
448 - Okay.\\
449 - Dr.\\
450 - Koothrappali, I just wanted to tell you that was amazing.\\
451 - Uh, counterpoint...\\
452 - To the car.\\
453 - Can I ask you a question?\\
454 - Of course you can.\\
455 - Ooh, that went well.\\
456 - Ask me another.\\
457 - I think I'm just gonna go.\\
458 - If there is life beneath the surface of these planets,     how would we even detect it?\\
459 - Uh, that's a complicated question.\\
460 - Let me start with a simpler one.\\
461 - Can I buy you a coffee?\\
462 - A-Also a complicated question.\\
463 - (chuckles nervously)\\
464 - Because I want to say yes, but if I drink coffee this late,     then I'll be up all night.\\
465 - Decaf, genius.\\
466 - (clears throat)\\
467 - I would love to.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Celebration Reverberation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Want to grab some lunch?\\
3 - You know what?\\
4 - I don't think so.\\
5 - Oh, let me guess, you're not eating   because the mean girls circled your chubby bits in marker?\\
6 - No.\\
7 - That, that right there.\\
8 - That's the reason.\\
9 - You're always making fun of me.\\
10 - (chuckles)\\
11 - Those are just jokes.\\
12 - It's my way of saying that we're friends,    and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few.\\
13 - years of constant ridicule.\\
14 - I-I think our relationship has become toxic.\\
15 - What are you saying?\\
16 - I think you and I need to spend some time away from each other.\\
17 - Look, I...\\
18 - I can see you're upset, but...\\
19 - I'm gonna need some ground rules.\\
20 - While we're apart, can I see other needy Indian men?\\
21 - Get out!\\
22 - Oh, Stuart, two questions:    Do you have the new Aquaman,    and do you mind if I use your back room to smoke some meat?\\
23 - Well, since it's you asking,    I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism.\\
24 - Why are you smoking meat?\\
25 - And why are you reading Aquaman?\\
26 - I am trying to make Amy a historically accurate    Little House on the Prairie dinner for her birthday, and...\\
27 - I want to be able to say I was reading it before it was cool.\\
28 - Wow, well, that's actually really sweet.\\
29 - The dinner thing.\\
30 - The Aquaman thing's dumb.\\
31 - Eh...\\
32 - Isn't Halley's birthday the same as Amy's?\\
33 - Yeah, but we're not doing anything big 'cause she's one,    Bernadette's on bed rest, and (clears throat)\\
34 - I'm lazy.\\
35 - Hey, guys.\\
36 - Hello.\\
37 - Hey.\\
38 - Howard.\\
39 - Raj.\\
40 - Excuse me.\\
41 - Really?\\
42 - Is this still happening?\\
43 - I'm willing to make up, but someone's being a baby.\\
44 - Ooh!\\
45 - I do love a riddle.\\
46 - Oh, let me see.\\
47 - See, my first guess would be Halley,    but that'd be strange to accuse her of being a baby    'cause she is a baby.\\
48 - Um...\\
49 - I suppose it could be Stuart;    his head does have a certain milky scent.\\
50 - Although...\\
51 - I-It's me, Sheldon.\\
52 - He-He's calling me a baby.\\
53 - No, I don't know.\\
54 - I saw Leonard put his keys in his mouth today.\\
55 - You're a grown man; act like it.\\
56 - Big talk coming from a guy holding an Archie comic book.\\
57 - Hey, werewolf Jughead is not your dad's Jughead.\\
58 - Come on, you guys have been friends forever.\\
59 - Quit fighting.\\
60 - I have an extra ticket    to the opening of The Last Jedi tonight.\\
61 - It was gonna be Howard's, but you can have it.\\
62 - You two had a good run.\\
63 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state  \\
64 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!   \\
65 -  The Earth began to cool  \\
66 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools   \\
67 -  We built the Wall  \\
68 -  We built the pyramids   \\
69 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery  \\
70 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
71 -  Bang!    \\
72 - Uh, who wants to go see Last Jedi again tonight?\\
73 - Mm, I'm in.\\
74 - (gasps)\\
75 - Me, too.\\
76 - It'll be nice to see the parts I missed while I was blinking.\\
77 - Hey, guys, there's a change of plans.\\
78 - We are having a party for Halley's birthday after all.\\
79 - Turns out Bernadette and "anyone who's not a heartless monster"      thinks that's the right thing to do.\\
80 - I don't like kids, but I do like birthday cake.\\
81 - Oh, wait, will there be sugary icing flowers on it?\\
82 - I don't know.\\
83 - I'll risk it.\\
84 - But if I have a tantrum and have to leave early, you'll know why.\\
85 - Here you go.\\
86 - Here you go.\\
87 - See you two there.\\
88 - Are you kidding me?\\
89 - You're not gonna invite me to Halley's birthday?\\
90 - I'm her godfather; that means something.\\
91 - Or-- hear me out on this-- it doesn't.\\
92 - Okay, that's enough.\\
93 - This fight either has to end or get way more entertaining.\\
94 - Don't worry about it 'cause I'm done putting up with him!\\
95 - I know you have a lot on your mind,    but when do you think we'll have an answer on those cake flowers?\\
96 - Hey.\\
97 - Hey.\\
98 - What you reading?\\
99 - Oh, it's your brother's Christmas letter.\\
100 - Ugh.\\
101 - If there's a picture of his wife and his kids    and his dogs and his horses all in matching pajamas,    I beg you to burn it.\\
102 - Aw, the people's pajamas have little horses on them,    and the horses' have little people.\\
103 - It's just his chance to brag about how great his life is.\\
104 - Oh, come on, it's nice.\\
105 - You know that nonprofit he works with?\\
106 - They built a hospital in Rwanda.\\
107 - (mocking): Look at me.\\
108 - I built a hospital in Rwanda.\\
109 - That is a good point.\\
110 - I hadn't thought of it that way.\\
111 - Hello.\\
112 - BOTH: Hey.\\
113 - So this is for Amy's birthday.\\
114 - Can I leave it here?\\
115 - Sure.\\
116 - What is it?\\
117 - A butter churn.\\
118 - Aw, that's what I got her.\\
119 - It's for her surprise frontier birthday dinner.\\
120 - I am making     hardtack, boiled salt pork,     and because it's a special day, a chewable gob of tree sap.\\
121 - Is that good?\\
122 - Uh, compared to other foods, no.\\
123 - Compared to other parts of a tree?\\
124 - Eh.\\
125 - And then after dinner, we will have birthday coitus.\\
126 - Do you think that will also be historically accurate?\\
127 - I assume like the rest of frontier life,     it'll be exhausting and short.\\
128 - You're exhausting and short.\\
129 - Hey, Stuart, you're coming to Halley's party, right?\\
130 - You bet.\\
131 - Plus, I live there and I was invited,     so it's already better than my tenth birthday party.\\
132 - Great.\\
133 - Can you bring a few things?\\
134 - Sure.\\
135 - What do you need?\\
136 - Balloons, streamers,     ice, snacks, a bounce house, face painter,     and a couple kids whose parents are willing to lie and say     they know me from the Daddy and Me class I've never been to.\\
137 - Where do you and Halley go every week?\\
138 - The important thing is we're together,     and if the movie gets too violent, I cover her eyes.\\
139 - Don't stress about this party.\\
140 - She's one; she's not gonna remember.\\
141 - The other day I showed her her toe, and she was shocked.\\
142 - It's not for the baby; it's for Bernadette.\\
143 - She's feeling guilty     about all the stuff she's missing with Halley.\\
144 - All right.\\
145 - Uncle Stuart's got your back.\\
146 - Ain't no party like a Stuart party     because Stuart's never invited to parties.\\
147 - Did the electricity go out?\\
148 - I don't know what you mean by "electricity," ma'am.\\
149 - I am just a farmer boy living in a little house on the prairie.\\
150 - (excited screaming)\\
151 - I'm glad you're happy.\\
152 - I wanted to do something special for your birthday.\\
153 - Oh, you did, you did!\\
154 - It's perfect!\\
155 - You do know that my birthday's tomorrow, right?\\
156 - This is just step one of your birthday weekend.\\
157 - Now, would you care to join me for an authentic frontier dinner     made entirely from scratch?\\
158 - I can't believe you did this.\\
159 - It's amazing!\\
160 - Oh, it's not a big deal.\\
161 - Just to be clear, it was a big deal.\\
162 - I was being modest.\\
163 - You got that, right?\\
164 - Loud and clear.\\
165 - Well, I hope you're hungry.\\
166 - Oh, I'm starving.\\
167 - Oh, good.\\
168 - Starvation is authentic to the time period.\\
169 - If you also have malaria     and a deep distrust of Native Americans,     we're really cooking with a woodstove.\\
170 - Is that butter?\\
171 - Yes.\\
172 - But don't blow it all on one biscuit.\\
173 - Took me nine hours to make that.\\
174 - I think I got churner's elbow.\\
175 - I know we only have coitus on my birthday,     but I don't know if I can wait until midnight.\\
176 - Oh, well, you'll be glad you did.\\
177 - Everyone knows the best foreplay     is rigid adherence to a strict schedule.\\
178 - Hey.\\
179 - What are you doing?\\
180 - Oh, I've decided to write my own Christmas letter.\\
181 - So I'm gonna make a list     of all the cool things we did this year.\\
182 - Oh, fun.\\
183 - Can I help?\\
184 - Yes.\\
185 - Can you think of a single cool thing we did this year?\\
186 - Uh, well, both of our jobs are going great.\\
187 - Sure.\\
188 - I mean, my Air Force project got taken away,     and you're not crazy about selling pharmaceuticals.\\
189 - I'll just write down "still employed."     Oh, we had our second anniversary.\\
190 - Uh, yeah,       but we did kind of forget about it,     so maybe just write "still married."     Great.\\
191 - Okay.\\
192 - Okay, that's a start.\\
193 - What else?\\
194 - You know, maybe this is enough.\\
195 - Let's look at our pictures; that-that'll jog our memories.\\
196 - What is that a picture of?\\
197 - Oh, uh, that's a mole on my back.\\
198 - I wanted to make sure it wasn't growing.\\
199 - How'd you get a picture of your own back?\\
200 - Sheldon took it.\\
201 - We're kind of mole buddies.\\
202 - Hey, that's a cute picture.\\
203 - Isn't that the day we almost went to the beach?\\
204 - Memorial Day?\\
205 - No, that was the day we almost went to the mountains.\\
206 - Oh.\\
207 - That's the great thing about California;     you can almost go to the mountains     and almost go to the beach in the same day.\\
208 - Yeah.\\
209 - (knock on door)\\
210 - Look, I'm sorry about not inviting you     to Halley's birthday.\\
211 - That wasn't cool.\\
212 - And of course we would love to have you.\\
213 - Here.\\
214 - Thank you.\\
215 - I'd really like to be there.\\
216 - Great, 'cause it's tomorrow, and I need you to plan it.\\
217 - What?\\
218 - Stuart was gonna help,     but the free clinic had an open spot for a colonoscopy,     and he jumped on it.\\
219 - So-so-so you're just apologizing because you need something?\\
220 - Yes, and I think it's pretty mature of me to admit it.\\
221 - Well, that's very insulting.\\
222 - Right again.\\
223 - Are you gonna help me or not?\\
224 - No, I will not help you.\\
225 - (sighs)\\
226 - But I will help Halley.\\
227 - She's my goddaughter, and I love her.\\
228 - And I have a lot of party favors     left over from Cinnamon's birthday, so...\\
229 - I hope she likes things that squeak when you chew on them.\\
230 - Sh-She's a human being, not an animal.\\
231 - But that actually would be a hit.\\
232 - Can I get you anything else?\\
233 - No, thanks.\\
234 - I think I'm good.\\
235 - You sure?\\
236 - There's still plenty of pork fat.\\
237 - Although, if we don't eat it,     I suppose we could turn it into soap.\\
238 - That might taste better.\\
239 - I think I'm just gonna go over here and sit on the couch.\\
240 - Oh, great.\\
241 - Then we will move on to stage two:     the pitching of woo.\\
242 - Ooh.\\
243 - Should I read you some bawdy   th century limericks?\\
244 - (chuckles): Okay.\\
245 - Oh, here.\\
246 - "There once was a priest from Terre Haute     who purchased a sheep and a goat..."     Hold on a second.\\
247 - Is it getting hot in here?\\
248 - Well, I didn't even get to the dirty part yet.\\
249 - No, I-I'm serious.\\
250 - Do you think there was something wrong with that food?\\
251 - Frontier scallops?\\
252 - I shouldn't think so.\\
253 - My stomach's feeling a little weird.\\
254 - Yeah.\\
255 - Uh, mine, too.\\
256 - I'm sure it's just the first sharp cramps of arousal.\\
257 - No.\\
258 - Th-This doesn't feel right.\\
259 - Hey, hey, save that sexy talk for the bedroom.\\
260 - You know, if you'll excuse me,     I am just going to go freshen up.\\
261 - (vomits loudly)\\
262 - Sheldon?\\
263 - I'll be out in a minute.\\
264 - (retches)\\
265 - I don't have a minute!\\
266 - (vomits)\\
267 - I can't believe you pulled this all together overnight.\\
268 - Uh, if I had more time, I could have gotten the Blue Man Group.\\
269 - One of them goes to my dry cleaner.\\
270 - Who, by the way, hates him.\\
271 - You really saved the day.\\
272 - Well, it's not for you.\\
273 - It's for Halley.\\
274 - And I'm sure     she'd appreciate it, if she knew what's going on or who you are.\\
275 - (weakly): Morning.\\
276 - Happy birthday.\\
277 - (weakly): Yeah, sure.\\
278 - Did you sleep at all?\\
279 - No.\\
280 - You?\\
281 - I passed out on the toilet once.\\
282 - I don't know if that counts.\\
283 - Feel any better?\\
284 - I feel terrible.\\
285 - Well...\\
286 - should we make love now?\\
287 - How can you even think about s*x?\\
288 - Hey, I'm a man; I have annual needs just like anyone.\\
289 - And besides,     it's our birthday tradition.\\
290 - You think you can do it     while I lie perfectly still and you don't touch me?\\
291 - I can try.\\
292 - (exhales)\\
293 - Want to do it again?\\
294 - Morning.\\
295 - Morning.\\
296 - "Kept Fern alive"?\\
297 - Who's Fern?\\
298 - No, the fern.\\
299 - The one in the bathroom.\\
300 - We're really calling that brown thing alive?\\
301 - Okay.\\
302 - So, how long have you been working on this?\\
303 - Oh, couple hours.\\
304 - I took a break to try to beat my high score on Mario Kart.     Well, did you do it?\\
305 - Do you see it on the board?\\
306 - Okay, this is silly.\\
307 - Our lives are great.\\
308 - I think so, too.\\
309 - So then why is this bugging you so much?\\
310 - I guess it feels like everyone's moving forward     and we're stuck.\\
311 - What do you mean?\\
312 - Well, we've been married two years.\\
313 - Should we think about what's next?\\
314 - Like buying a house or having a baby?\\
315 - Look, I want to do all those things someday,     but there's a bunch of stuff I want to do first.\\
316 - Okay, like what?\\
317 - I don't know, stay thin and have money.\\
318 - No, no, I-I'm serious.\\
319 - If there's things we want to do, let's start doing them.\\
320 - Okay.\\
321 - Well, we've never been on a big trip together.\\
322 - I would love that.\\
323 - Okay, there's something for your letter:     "Considered going on a trip."     It's just a day trip,     but we could take the ferry out to Catalina.\\
324 - Great, let's do it.\\
325 - Amy's in the bathroom and I need to...!\\
326 - (retches)\\
327 - (door slams)\\
328 - (vomiting loudly)\\
329 - It's like I can hear the ocean already.\\
330 - Okay.\\
331 - Thanks for letting me know.\\
332 - Hey, what's going on?\\
333 - Bernadette's sister's kids are sick and they're not coming.\\
334 - But they're the whole reason the cupcakes are vegan!\\
335 - BERNADETTE: How's the party coming?\\
336 - Good!\\
337 - Great!\\
338 - Our friends should be here any second!\\
339 - Those are the only other people you invited?\\
340 - What about the kids from the Daddy and Me class?\\
341 - Oh, grow up.\\
342 - Uh-oh.\\
343 - What?\\
344 - I left the food out.\\
345 - You afraid it's gonna go good?\\
346 - How are you feeling?\\
347 - Ugh.\\
348 - My stomach aches, I got the chills,     my mouth tastes weird,     it hurts to swallow,     and I've got a little double vision.\\
349 - Yeah.\\
350 - I'm feeling better, too.\\
351 - (groans softly)\\
352 - Well, this party's a disaster.\\
353 - Don't blame the party!\\
354 - You know how many favors I had to call in     with my bounce house guy to get Wonder Woman?\\
355 - Is that Wonder Woman?\\
356 - Technically, it's a Chinese knockoff called     Happy Strong Swimsuit Lady.\\
357 - Then I take it back; it's a great party.\\
358 - Well, you can sit here and sulk if you want.\\
359 - I'm gonna go celebrate Halley's first birthday.\\
360 - Which I planned with no help from you.\\
361 - What are you doing?\\
362 - It's a bounce house!\\
363 - I'm gonna go bounce in it!\\
364 - You're supposed to take your shoes off     before you go in there!\\
365 - You know what?\\
366 - I'm stressed about my daughter's birthday party.\\
367 - I don't need your attitude.\\
368 - Well, I worked really hard on this,     and you haven't even said thank you.\\
369 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
370 - Thank you.\\
371 - Thank you for blaming me     for everything that's wrong in your life!\\
372 - Thank you for walking out on our friendship!\\
373 - You are welcome!\\
374 - And thank you for mocking me for all of these years!\\
375 - Thank you for making it so easy!\\
376 - Why are you being such a jerk?\\
377 - Because you're my best friend and you hurt my feelings!\\
378 - Well, you're my best friend and you hurt my feelings!\\
379 - I can't believe you shoved me!\\
380 - Well, I can't believe you shoved me!     But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?!\\
381 - It was!\\
382 - Do it again!\\
383 - Gladly!\\
384 - Okay, now at the same time!\\
385 - Oh, oh, that was awesome!\\
386 - Yeah, okay, this time, knees, then feet.\\
387 - One, two, three.\\
388 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Again!\\
389 - Again!\\
390 - Hello.\\
391 - Hi.\\
392 - You made it.\\
393 - How you two feeling?\\
394 - Oh, a little better.\\
395 - Those books should have been called     Little Outhouse on the Prairie.     BERNADETTE: Halley's awake and ready for her party!\\
396 - Be right up!\\
397 - Ooh, I want to see the birthday girl.\\
398 - I'd love to see her.\\
399 - BERNADETTE: Walk slow it takes a while to get this bra back on.\\
400 - You know...\\
401 - it's still your birthday.\\
402 - (chuckles)\\
403 - It is.\\
404 - And...\\
405 - we are both...\\
406 - feeling better.\\
407 - We are.\\
408 - And there's no one in that bounce house.\\
409 - (whispers): No.\\
410 - Great.\\
411 - Let's go jump for a bit,     and then find a bedroom to have coitus in.
\subsection {Episode 12: The Matrimonial Metric}
1 - Hey, can you do me a favor?\\
2 - Can we try to avoid talking to our friends tonight   about our wedding plans?\\
3 - I'll do you one better.\\
4 - I'll avoid talking to our friends entirely   and play on my phone.\\
5 - It's just, I haven't picked a maid of honor yet,   and I'm having trouble deciding between Penny and Bernadette.\\
6 - Ah, understandable.\\
7 - They are quite similar--    both blonde former waitresses who married beneath them.\\
8 - Penny is my best friend,    but I was Bernadette's maid of honor,    and I think she kind of expects it.\\
9 - So if anyone brings it up tonight,    just maybe you can help me change the subject.\\
10 - How about this?\\
11 - I dominate the conversation so hard,    no one has a chance to get a word in edgewise.\\
12 - I don't know.\\
13 - They might see that coming.\\
14 - What if we have a code word?\\
15 - Ooh, now you're speaking my catamaran.\\
16 - That's my code word for “language.”    Okay, fine, catamaran.\\
17 - That's our code word.\\
18 - No, that's my code word.\\
19 - Get your own.\\
20 - Okay.\\
21 - Uh, pretzels.\\
22 - You hear me say pretzels, you change the subject.\\
23 - Rhinos are my least favorite animals at the zoo.\\
24 - What?\\
25 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
26 - I thought we started.\\
27 - Hey, just-just hold the gate still while I screw it in.\\
28 - You know, I don't know how I feel    about all this baby-proofing.\\
29 - If Halley can't teach herself to walk down the stairs,    then maybe that's nature's way of saying    the Wolowitz line ends here.\\
30 - That's funny.\\
31 - I always thought    Howard was nature's way of saying    the Wolowitz line ends here.\\
32 - Me, too, but life does find a way!\\
33 - Hey, Halley can't reach the liquor cabinet.\\
34 - Why did you baby-proof it?\\
35 - How did you know we did?\\
36 - Fair point.\\
37 - LEONARD: Bernadette still going stir-crazy?\\
38 - Oh, a little.\\
39 - Two months of bed rest-- it's kind of rough.\\
40 - Really?\\
41 - That sounds great.\\
42 - How do I get that?\\
43 - You'd either have to break your hip or let Howard knock you up.\\
44 - Now, either way, you'll get flowers the next morning.\\
45 - She's actually been keeping herself busy    doing wedding research for you.\\
46 - Oh, she-she doesn't have to do that.\\
47 - She wants to.\\
48 - After all, you were her maid of honor.\\
49 - Sheldon, tell your funny story about pretzels.\\
50 - Oh, right.\\
51 - Yeah, oh, yeah.\\
52 - Did you know that we've been thinking    of having pretzels at our wedding?\\
53 - Hmm?\\
54 - No, no.\\
55 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
56 - I'm sorry.\\
57 - No, rhinos.\\
58 - We're having rhinos at our wedding.\\
59 - No!\\
60 - (stammers)\\
61 - I got to go.\\
62 - I'm gonna need some help.\\
63 - Someone baby-proofed the front door.\\
64 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
65 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
66 -  The Earth began to cool \\
67 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
68 -  We built the Wall \\
69 -  We built the pyramids \\
70 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
71 -  That all started with a big bang \\
72 -  Bang! \\
73 - Sheldon, what am I gonna do about my maid of honor?\\
74 - I mean, Bernadette gave me all these bridal magazines.\\
75 - She even folded down the pages with the good dresses.\\
76 - Hmm.\\
77 - Hmm.\\
78 - I get it.\\
79 - You know, Leonard once borrowed my Edmund Scientific catalogue    and dog-eared some pages.\\
80 - Never got 'em straight again.\\
81 - Well, that is exactly the same thing.\\
82 - You really understand my dilemma.\\
83 - Actually, I do.\\
84 - My mother    is pushing for my brother, Georgie, to be my best man,    and I hate to disappoint her again.\\
85 - I already rejected her savior and her LinkedIn invitation.\\
86 - How are we gonna make these decisions    without anybody getting upset?\\
87 - Well, what if we take emotion out of the process,    and base it on empirical metrics?\\
88 - Then we aren't really making the decision;    the data is.\\
89 - So we can hurt our friends' feelings    without taking any responsibility?\\
90 - Me likey.\\
91 - But how do we apply quantitative metrics     to something as subjective as choosing a wedding party?\\
92 - That decision only seems subjective.\\
93 - In reality,     people in a wedding party perform very specific functions,     and some will perform those better than others.\\
94 - If I may use a superhero analogy...\\
95 - You may not.\\
96 - Okay, I'll use real people.\\
97 - Um, if a certain dog-like loyalty is useful,     then it's Leonard, hmm?\\
98 - If, uh, having a PEZ dispenser     filled with TUMS is an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.\\
99 - If a best man with fake testicles hanging     from his truck is important,     well, then, my brother's back in the running.\\
100 - Okay, I see your point.\\
101 - So we break down each of the roles     into their component parts,     and then design specialized tests for each.\\
102 - Exactly.\\
103 - Boy, if I had known getting married was going to     involve so much science, I'd have proposed years ago.\\
104 - So Leonard, tell everyone your news.\\
105 - Oh, oh, I'm starting a book.\\
106 - That would be big news from Penny,     but you've read a book before.\\
107 - He means he's writing a book.\\
108 - I do.\\
109 - It's something I've been thinking about for a long time.\\
110 - Yeah.\\
111 - It's about a brilliant physicist     who solves crimes using science.\\
112 - Oh, Leonard...\\
113 - It's not about you.\\
114 - He probably has to say that for legal reasons.\\
115 - WOLOWITZ: Uh-oh.\\
116 - They gave us plain rice instead of fried rice.\\
117 - Well, no fair!\\
118 - I SoulCycled this morning.\\
119 - I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.\\
120 - Well, I would say that this constitutes a catering crisis.\\
121 - I agree.\\
122 - Who's gonna step up and handle it?\\
123 - Doesn't matter.\\
124 - This is fine.\\
125 - (mouths)\\
126 - Penny?\\
127 - (mouth full): What?\\
128 - You know what?\\
129 - I'll take care of it.\\
130 - (speaks Mandarin)\\
131 - Done.\\
132 - You didn't make him feel bad, did you?\\
133 - Actually, he was laughing.\\
134 - (laughs)\\
135 - I'm really impressed at how you handled that, Howard.\\
136 - WOLOWITZ: Please.\\
137 - I've been sending food back my entire life.\\
138 - One of my first full sentences was,     “I had breast milk for breakfast”     Excuse me, b-before we start eating,     I-I would like to make a toast.\\
139 - Oh, nice.\\
140 - Oh, nice.\\
141 - If only I could think of one.\\
142 - Someone else go.\\
143 - Hey.\\
144 - Here's the sewing kit you asked for.\\
145 - Ooh!\\
146 - A minute,   .\\
147 - Quick.\\
148 - You were timing me?\\
149 - Yes.\\
150 - I am going through a bit of a timing phase.\\
151 - How long will it last?\\
152 - We'll find out.\\
153 - What did you need the kit for?\\
154 - Oh, um...\\
155 - Sh-Sheldon was squatting down to pick up a fork     and he ripped his pants.\\
156 - Oh, someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.\\
157 - (door closes)\\
158 - Oh, quick thinking.\\
159 - But for future lies,     this is as far as I can squat.\\
160 - Penny gets    points for the sewing kit.\\
161 - Yeah, minus five,     because this is mine.\\
162 - Well, she's still pulling a commanding lead.\\
163 - Did Bernadette even try to send us a sewing kit?\\
164 - She did.\\
165 - Amazon, standard shipping,     not even Prime.\\
166 - (gasps)\\
167 - We could've done that ourselves.\\
168 - (chuckles)\\
169 - That's what she said.\\
170 - Maybe we're being old-fashioned,     defining these roles by gender.\\
171 - You know, historically, the best man's role     was to defend the bride and groom in combat.\\
172 - I mean, if that's not Penny,     I don't know what we're doing here.\\
173 - I see your point.\\
174 - Okay, we are officially open to a best woman     and a gentleman of honor.\\
175 - Oh, those names are terrible.\\
176 - One point off for you.\\
177 - What am I being tested for?\\
178 - Oh, it's not important.\\
179 - But if you don't pass,     none of this matters.\\
180 - Okay, what's the next test?\\
181 - Loyalty.\\
182 - We need to choose someone who has our backs,     someone who will keep our secrets even from each other.\\
183 - Well, I don't have any secrets from you.\\
184 - Do you have secrets from me?\\
185 - Yes.\\
186 - Oh, that has been weighing on me for years.\\
187 - Come here.\\
188 - Would you call yourself a loyal and trustworthy friend?\\
189 - Yeah, I like to think so.\\
190 - Great.\\
191 - Because I need to tell you something about Howard,     but you can't tell him that I told you.\\
192 - Nope.\\
193 - Don't want to hear it.\\
194 - Do not like to engage in gossip.\\
195 - Okay.\\
196 - I respect your integrity.\\
197 - Is it about his special underwear?\\
198 - Because I already know.\\
199 - And that's all I'll say.\\
200 - Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.\\
201 - It's really sweet of you to come by and keep me company.\\
202 - Agreed.\\
203 - Uh...\\
204 - So, listen, I have a secret     that I need to tell someone.\\
205 - But you can never say a word.\\
206 - Not even to Howard.\\
207 - I'm your girl.\\
208 - Lay it on me.\\
209 - Really?\\
210 - You keep things from your husband?\\
211 - No, I tell him everything.\\
212 - Don't be a child.\\
213 - Okay.\\
214 - Here it is.\\
215 - I can control the thermostat     in Leonard's apartment with my phone.\\
216 - And when he makes me mad,     I turn it up, slightly.\\
217 - Oh, hey.\\
218 - I didn't know you were here.\\
219 - What are you two talking about?\\
220 - Literally, nothing interesting.\\
221 - Oh, you're good.\\
222 - Okay, getting to the ceremony on time.\\
223 - Leonard, quick.\\
224 - I need you to get me     to Arcadia within the hour.\\
225 - The train store's having a sale.\\
226 - Why can't Amy drive you?\\
227 - Because of the tradition that I cannot see Amy     on the day of the train store sale.\\
228 - Please, please see a doctor.\\
229 - Next test.\\
230 - Just wait one second.\\
231 - Is it getting hot in here?\\
232 - (laughs)\\
233 - I'm sorry.\\
234 - Where were we?\\
235 - How well do our friends know us?\\
236 - So I was talking to my favorite aunt...\\
237 - Aunt Doe, right?\\
238 - Exactly.\\
239 - Did she ever figure out what that thing on her knee was?\\
240 - Turns out it was a chocolate chip.\\
241 - Hmm.\\
242 - Makes sense, she does like to bake.\\
243 - Yes, she does.\\
244 - Damn, you are a thoroughbred.\\
245 - You know, dealing with cold feet     is an important part of being both best man and maid of honor.\\
246 - Maybe we should test for that ability.\\
247 - You really think you might get cold feet?\\
248 - Actually, I was talking about you.\\
249 - Amy...\\
250 - if there's one thing in this world I'm sure of,     you are right to be worried.\\
251 - Good night.\\
252 - Howard.\\
253 - I've had my eye on this limited edition Swamp Thing,     but now that I'm about to buy it,     I'm having second thoughts.\\
254 - What do you think?\\
255 - I don't know, Sheldon, it's pretty expensive.\\
256 - Yes, but what if it will make me happy, you know,     waking up and seeing it every morning for the rest of my life?\\
257 - Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?\\
258 - Yeah, well, Bernadette's no prize either!\\
259 - Hey, what you doing?\\
260 - Oh.\\
261 - Sheldon gave me a brain teaser.\\
262 - It's kind of fun.\\
263 - It's about a group of people at dinner,     and you have to figure out where they can sit without fighting.\\
264 - Oh, yeah, is this the one where Mr. Green     can't sit next to anyone eating meat,     and Uncle Light Blue     won't sit next to any of the darker colors?\\
265 - Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?\\
266 - Amy did.\\
267 - I solved it already.\\
268 - Really?\\
269 - Yeah.\\
270 - Same way I solved my jury duty summons,     I threw it away.\\
271 - KOOTHRAPPALI: No, no, no, no, no.\\
272 - Uh, Aunt Orange can't sit next to the bar     without Ms. Pink saying,     “Jesus thinks you've had enough whiskey.”     Did Sheldon and Amy give you guys that puzzle, too?\\
273 - Yeah.\\
274 - Is it just me or have they been acting strange?\\
275 - I don't think they're acting.\\
276 - Yeah, the other day, Sheldon made me     take him to the train store.\\
277 - We didn't go inside.\\
278 - He just said,     “Nicely done,” and then we went home.\\
279 - Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring     and told me to hold on to it.\\
280 - I got one, too.\\
281 - Yeah, same.\\
282 - Yeah, me, too.\\
283 - But-but Cinnamon ate it.\\
284 - I-I'll get it back tomorrow.\\
285 - I have to say, this is going pretty well.\\
286 - It is.\\
287 - I-If experimenting on humans is morally wrong,     then I don't want to be morally right.\\
288 - (door opens)\\
289 - Hey, are you testing us     to see who gets to be in your wedding?\\
290 - Yes.\\
291 - No.\\
292 - Wha-- they're rating us.\\
293 - And I'm in last?\\
294 - Don't panic, there's still time.\\
295 - Look, it's a marathon, not a sprint.\\
296 - You know what, this is so insulting.\\
297 - I-I don't even want to be your stupid best man.\\
298 - Yeah.\\
299 - Me neither.\\
300 - W-W-Wait, wait.\\
301 - Just out of curiosity, which one of you figured it out?\\
302 - I did.\\
303 - Impressive.\\
304 - Hello, Stuart.\\
305 - Oh, hey, Sheldon.\\
306 - Can I interest you in a cappuccino?\\
307 - When did you start selling those?\\
308 - Oh, someone left it here, but it's still warm.\\
309 - Want to say four bucks?\\
310 - No, thank you.\\
311 - Oh.\\
312 - Everything okay?\\
313 - Well...\\
314 - I secretly experimented on my friends,     and now none of them want to be my best man.\\
315 - So, you know, normal wedding drama.\\
316 - Sorry.\\
317 - Probably have to use my stupid brother.\\
318 - So get ready for a wedding toast delivered by his armpit.\\
319 - Well, if you really don't want to use your brother,     I'd be your best man.\\
320 - Really?\\
321 - Yeah, we're friends.\\
322 - Plus, it'd be nice.\\
323 - Never really been called the best before.\\
324 - Or a man, for that matter.\\
325 - Okay, well, uh, thank you, Stuart.\\
326 - That's a very generous offer.\\
327 - My pleasure.\\
328 - I-I understand     the best man usually receives a present.\\
329 - That's true.\\
330 - Can never have too much Claritin.\\
331 - You're still working on Sheldon's dumb brain teaser?\\
332 - Oh, my God, Dr.\\
333 - Purple's a woman!\\
334 - Of course!\\
335 - Oh, that feels so good.\\
336 - Hello.\\
337 - I believe I owe the three of you an apology.\\
338 - No argument here.\\
339 - By experimenting on you,     I realize I've violated your trust     and possibly the Geneva Convention.\\
340 - Is that it?\\
341 - No.\\
342 - So as to not upset any of you further,     I've asked Stuart to be my best man,     and he's agreed.\\
343 - You're all still invited to the bachelor party.\\
344 - Uh, he's thinking Costco and the theme is browsing.\\
345 - You picked Stuart over one of us?\\
346 - Well, I wanted to choose one of you,     but you all turned against me.\\
347 - Picking a best man isn't about keeping score.\\
348 - But you're all my friends.\\
349 - I mean, if I didn't collect data,     how could I possibly choose among the three of you?\\
350 - Well, that's actually kind of sweet.\\
351 - Is it?\\
352 - Perhaps I said it wrong.\\
353 - Look, this is your wedding, just pick whoever you want.\\
354 - You don't need to worry about anyone else but yourself.\\
355 - You've kind of been training for this your whole life.\\
356 - Thank you, Leonard.\\
357 - And if it helps...\\
358 - these two are quitters.\\
359 - (keys jingle)\\
360 - Hey, what you making?\\
361 - Uh, well, I spilled the cheese packet,     so we're having mac and nothing.\\
362 - Oh.\\
363 - Yeah.\\
364 - I'll just have the mac.\\
365 - “Nothing” gives me gas.\\
366 - (chuckles)\\
367 - Why are you in such a good mood?\\
368 - Mm, I just talked to Sheldon.\\
369 - He apologized about the tests and asked me to be his best man.\\
370 - Uh, great.\\
371 - After all you've done for him, he should've asked you.\\
372 - And Amy's your best friend.\\
373 - I'm sure she'll come to her senses and pick you.\\
374 - Okay, she's not my best friend.\\
375 - We're not   .\\
376 - If she wants Bernadette to be her maid of honor,     I really don't care.\\
377 - Sounds like you care.\\
378 - No, I mean, it-it's just annoying.\\
379 - You know, we talk every day.\\
380 - We see each other all the time.\\
381 - She's always there for me, and basically--     oh, my God, Amy's my best friend.\\
382 - You okay?\\
383 - No, my best friend didn't ask me to be her maid of honor.\\
384 - I'm pissed!\\
385 - So, bottom line, what you did was wrong and cruel,     which the mother of my children finds oddly appealing.\\
386 - So she still wants to be my maid of honor?\\
387 - Maid of honor, hit woman, whatever you need.\\
388 - Make the call.\\
389 - Look, I know this is your wedding,     and you can do whatever you want,     but if you think anyone but me is gonna be your maid of honor,     then you're an idiot because you are my best friend.\\
390 - Too late.\\
391 - Bernade...\\
392 - Bestie!\\
393 - Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird     Sheldon made me best man instead of you.\\
394 - It's okay.\\
395 - I was best man for two whole days.\\
396 - No one can take that away from me.\\
397 - Except for Sheldon, when he did.\\
398 - Although, if you want to be a part     of the wedding party,     I suppose you could be the flower girl.\\
399 - Sold.\\
400 - Well, I thought Halley was gonna be the flower girl.\\
401 - Oh, that's much better.\\
402 - Sorry, Stuart, you're out.\\
403 - Hey, so is Bernadette okay with me being maid of honor?\\
404 - Actually, I haven't had the courage to tell her.\\
405 - I guess I should do that.\\
406 - Uh, yeah.\\
407 - (clears throat)\\
408 - Although, as maid of honor,     your job is to make my life easier.\\
409 - (groans)\\
410 - Damn it.\\
411 - Hey, Stuart, you still want in on this wedding?\\
412 - Not that much.\\
413 - (sighs)\\
414 - Fine, I'll do it.\\
415 - But do me a favor and unlock the liquor cabinet first.
\subsection {Episode 13: The Solo Oscillation}
1 - Hey!\\
2 - Look what I got everybody.\\
3 - Newspapers?\\
4 - Did you find a portal back to the     s?\\
5 - No.\\
6 - If he had that, he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC   from breaking up.\\
7 - Oh, please.\\
8 - I'm glad they broke up.\\
9 - Otherwise, Justin would never have brought sexy back.\\
10 - One thing you can't get on an iPad,   (inhales)\\
11 - the smell of ink and paper.\\
12 - One more reason iPads are better.\\
13 - They reviewed my planetarium show.\\
14 - Yeah.\\
15 - It's on page three of the Arts and Leisure section.\\
16 - Oh, look, they still have Far Side.    Oh, I don't get that one.\\
17 - Oh, he's pushing when he should be pulling.\\
18 - Hmm.\\
19 - I don't think he belongs in that gifted school, then.\\
20 - What are you doing?\\
21 - Making a boat.\\
22 - When I was a kid, my dad showed me how.\\
23 - Boy, you'll do anything to avoid reading.\\
24 - Guys, it's under “Things to do this weekend.”    I can't find it.\\
25 - What does it say?\\
26 - That it's a thing to do this weekend.\\
27 - That's great, Raj.\\
28 - Congratulations.\\
29 - You know, while we're bragging,    The Journal of Prosthetic Medicine    just wrote up the project that Howard and I are working on.\\
30 - Well, you didn't tell me that.\\
31 - Oh, it just came out.\\
32 - It's just a little blurb.\\
33 - Oh, well, good for you.\\
34 - You know, Bert and I have started isolating zircons    from meteorites for our dark matter search.\\
35 - Oh.\\
36 - Well, how nice.\\
37 - Everyone's doing impressive work.\\
38 - What have you been working on these days?\\
39 - Whoa, whoa.\\
40 - Where'd that come from?\\
41 - Where did what come from?\\
42 - (stammers)\\
43 - I try to be supportive,    and you break out the hot lights and the rubber hose.\\
44 - I just asked what you've been working on.\\
45 - Oh, my God, let it go.\\
46 - Do you believe this guy?\\
47 - I did it!\\
48 - See?\\
49 - It's a...\\
50 - it's a boat.\\
51 - It's also a hat.\\
52 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
53 -  Then nearly    billion years ago, expansion started-- Wait! \\
54 -  The Earth began to cool \\
55 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
56 -  We built the Wall \\
57 -  We built the pyramids \\
58 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
59 -  That all started with a big bang \\
60 -  Bang! \\
61 - Okay, how do you want to play this?\\
62 - Do you want to pretend like nothing's bothering you    and blow up later, or do you just want to be    a maniac right now?\\
63 - Nothing is bothering me.\\
64 - Fine.\\
65 - Be that way.\\
66 - If you want to talk, I'll be flushing my sinuses.\\
67 - Wait.\\
68 - I have a confession.\\
69 - When I berated Leonard,    it was a clever ruse to conceal the fact    that I'm not working on anything.\\
70 - Well, I think I speak for everyone    when I say, “No!”    The truth is I have nothing of interest to pursue.\\
71 - Well, maybe this is the perfect opportunity    to take some time for yourself and refocus.\\
72 - I'm sure you'll find something you're excited about.\\
73 - Thank you, Amy.\\
74 - I don't know what I'd do without you.\\
75 - Hey, can I stay here?\\
76 - Sheldon kicked me out.\\
77 - Well, is everything okay?\\
78 - Yeah.\\
79 - He just wants some alone time to work.\\
80 - Fine.\\
81 - Make yourself at home.\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - We were just about to watch a little TV.\\
84 - You're welcome to join us.\\
85 - Thanks.\\
86 - I'll be right with you.\\
87 - I just have to, uh, do my neti pot.\\
88 - So what are you guys gonna watch?\\
89 - Okay.\\
90 - Hey, uh, what do you think we should open our show with?\\
91 - Uh, “Thor and Doctor Jones” or “Let's Get Astrophysical”?\\
92 - I don't know.\\
93 - I think we should start with something    that gets them up on their feet.\\
94 - Maybe “Sherlock Around the Clock.”    Great, yeah.\\
95 - Uh, let's give it a try.\\
96 - (playing rock music)\\
97 - BERNADETTE (over monitor): Halley's napping!\\
98 - Keep it down!\\
99 - Oh.\\
100 - Right.\\
101 - Sorry.\\
102 - It's cool.\\
103 - We don't need volume to rock.\\
104 - Instead of blowing the roof off this place,    we can gently lift it off    and set it quietly down in the backyard.\\
105 - (whispering): Okay.\\
106 - One, two, three, four.\\
107 - (playing quietly)\\
108 - (quietly):  Holmes said to Watson \\
109 -  On Baker Street \\
110 -  Come on, Doctor \\
111 -  Time to move them feet \\
112 - (whispers): Sing it with us.\\
113 -  Sherlock, Sherlock \\
114 -  Sherlock around the clock \\
115 - (whispers): We can't hear you.\\
116 -  Sherlock, Sherlock \\
117 -  Sherlock around the clock \\
118 - (Halley crying)\\
119 - BERNADETTE: Nice going.\\
120 - Sorry.\\
121 - Sorry.\\
122 - I'll get her.\\
123 - One sec.\\
124 - (Halley continues crying)\\
125 - BERNADETTE: You bought diapers, right?\\
126 - Be right back.\\
127 - (whispers): Rock and roll!\\
128 - Okay.\\
129 - Scratch paper, check.\\
130 - Whiteboard, check.\\
131 - Chex Mix, check.\\
132 - And here we go.\\
133 - (grunts)\\
134 - (ringtone playing)\\
135 - Oh, dang it.\\
136 - Hello, Mother.\\
137 - Hi there, Shelly.\\
138 - You will never believe     who I ran into at the barbecue festival.\\
139 - I am right in the middle of some very important work.\\
140 - I don't have time for this right now.\\
141 - Then why did you answer the phone?\\
142 - Because you raised me to be polite.\\
143 - Now stop bothering me.\\
144 - Hello again.\\
145 - Who did you see at the barbecue festival?\\
146 - Mr. Watkins.\\
147 - Really?\\
148 - You called me and interrupted my work to tell me     that you ran into somebody you could plausibly run into?\\
149 - I'm sorry, Mother, I really need to focus here.\\
150 - I will speak to you next week.\\
151 - Okay, sweetheart.\\
152 - I'll talk to you then.\\
153 - (sighs)\\
154 - I thought Mr. Watkins moved to Florida.\\
155 - He did.\\
156 - He was back visiting his son.\\
157 - Oh, gosh darn it, that is interesting.\\
158 - Was it Tommy or Joe?\\
159 - I bet it was Joe, 'cause he and Tommy had a falling out     over that time-share.\\
160 - You guys do anything fun after dinner?\\
161 - Well, actually Amy came back over and we hung out.\\
162 - Did you know that we're both spelling bee champs?\\
163 - We stayed up for hours trying to stump each other.\\
164 - Who won?\\
165 - Oh, she thought she had me with “appoggiatura,”     but I shut that down expeditiously.\\
166 - E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y.\\
167 - Expeditiously.\\
168 - Wow.\\
169 - I bet that made Penny take off all of her clothes.\\
170 - Put her pajamas on and then go to bed early.\\
171 - At, like,  :  .\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - - Hey.\\
174 - - Hey.\\
175 - - Hey.\\
176 - Oh, are we still on for band practice this evening?\\
177 - Oh, shoot.\\
178 - I promised I would take Halley over to Bernadette's parents.\\
179 - Dude, the gig is, like, next weekend.\\
180 - I know.\\
181 - I'm sorry.\\
182 - (sighs)\\
183 - I really want to do this,     but I just don't think I have the time.\\
184 - Okay.\\
185 - I-I guess I'll have to cancel.\\
186 - Toby Greenbaum will have to become a man without us.\\
187 - Too bad, you guys kill at bar mitzvahs.\\
188 - And other events that people can't leave.\\
189 - I don't want to be the one who breaks up the band.\\
190 - You know, maybe you should...\\
191 - (chuckles)\\
192 - think about replacing me.\\
193 - Okay.\\
194 - I mean,     I know it'll be hard since we...\\
195 - Oh, I bet Bert could do it.\\
196 - He plays guitar.\\
197 - I'm gonna go ask him.\\
198 - I guess he forgot that I play the cello.\\
199 - I-I don't think he did.\\
200 - Okay, I think it's ready.\\
201 - Should we put on safety goggles?\\
202 - Well, the funnest fun is the safest fun, so yes.\\
203 - Hey.\\
204 - Hi.\\
205 - Hello.\\
206 - Oh, Amy, you're here...\\
207 - again.\\
208 - Yeah, Sheldon said he needed another night to work,     so I said I'd give him some space.\\
209 - So what's all this?\\
210 - Well, Amy and I were talking about old science fair projects,     and how fun it would be to recreate them.\\
211 - We're making hot ice.\\
212 - Mm-hmm.\\
213 - It's pretty cool.\\
214 - (chuckles)\\
215 - Nice one.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - Turns out we both     did this as our science fair projects in ninth grade.\\
218 - Do you remember any of your high school projects?\\
219 - Uh, well, I remember telling Jenny Runyon     that I would teach her how to flirt with boys     if she put my name on her project.\\
220 - I got an “A,” she got pregnant.\\
221 - Girls like you are why I had to come straight home after school.\\
222 - Check this out.\\
223 - PENNY: Wow, that's amazing.\\
224 - LEONARD: Mm-hmm.\\
225 - The crystallization is an exothermic process,     so the ice is actually hot.\\
226 - I won first place for this.\\
227 - So did I.\\
228 - I threw Jenny's baby shower.\\
229 - Oh, hey, in seventh grade,     I built a cobra wave.\\
230 - You want to do that?\\
231 - Oh, we can come up with a wave speed formula,     and see how accurately we can predict the amplitude.\\
232 - Wow, I didn't think anything could top     last night's spelling bee, but here comes math.\\
233 - I'm sorry, we-we don't have to do more experiments.\\
234 - Let's do something we can all enjoy.\\
235 - Hey, uh, you want to watch that show you like     where people want to buy a house and then they do?\\
236 - No, no, you guys do your experiments.\\
237 - I'll go pick up dinner.\\
238 - Are you sure?\\
239 - Yeah, you're having science fun,     and I don't want to interfere, or watch you.\\
240 - Did I actually do it?\\
241 - I did.\\
242 - I did.\\
243 - The answer is one in    million.\\
244 - What is?\\
245 - The odds of you running into Mr. Watkins.\\
246 - Oh, Shelly.\\
247 - I have bad news.\\
248 - Mr. Watkins passed this morning.\\
249 - Oh.\\
250 - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.\\
251 - I know.\\
252 - What are the odds of that?\\
253 - Call you back.\\
254 - LEONARD: Now let's calculate the amplitude!\\
255 - AMY: All right!\\
256 - Sheldon?\\
257 - Sheldon?\\
258 - Sheldon?\\
259 - It's annoying when you do it.\\
260 - I brought pizza.\\
261 - Oh, thank you.\\
262 - I have been working pretty hard.\\
263 - I-I could use a break.\\
264 - What's that?\\
265 - Oh, yeah, that is an experiment     to see how many parallelograms I could draw     while holding my breath.\\
266 - Is that where you blacked out?\\
267 - No, actually,     that's where I blacked out.\\
268 - And this?\\
269 - That is a list     of all the different types of natural disasters.\\
270 - “Fire-quake”?\\
271 - I made that one up.\\
272 - Which I shouldn't have, because now I'm scared of it.\\
273 - Hey, I thought you were working on actual science.\\
274 - I am.\\
275 - I'm trying to come up with a new approach to dark matter,     but people keep distracting me.\\
276 - First, my mother kept answering the phone when I called,     even though she knew I was busy.\\
277 - And now you show up with my favorite shape of food--     a circle made of triangles served in a square box.\\
278 - Maybe I'll just eat this in the laundry room.\\
279 - No, no.\\
280 - Wait.\\
281 - You don't have to go,     as long as you sit quietly and don't say anything.\\
282 - Fine.\\
283 - (clears throat)\\
284 - Mmm.\\
285 - Good.\\
286 - Mmm.\\
287 - Are you mocking me?\\
288 - Hey, you want to hear one of my geology songs?\\
289 - So it's about rocks?\\
290 - Better.\\
291 - It's about a boulder.\\
292 - Isn't that the same thing?\\
293 - Far from it.\\
294 - A boulder has a diameter greater than   .\\
295 - centimeters.\\
296 - Is that fact in the song?\\
297 - No.\\
298 - Yes.\\
299 - It's sung from the viewpoint of the boulder     that chases Indiana Jones.\\
300 - That's right up our alley.\\
301 - Let's hear it.\\
302 - Okay.\\
303 - (playing rock music)\\
304 -  Alone in my temple in the middle of Peru \\
305 -  A giant stone ball with nothing much to do \\
306 -  But if you steal my idol \\
307 -  I will roll right over you \\
308 -  'Cause I'm six tons of granite and micaceous schist \\
309 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite and \\
310 - BOTH:  Micaceous schist \\
311 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite and, uh, micaceous schist \\
312 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite \\
313 -  And, uh, micaceous schist \\
314 -  Yeah, I'm six... \\
315 - So, I think if we want     to predict the height of the wave, we need to use     elasticity theory and model the lattice     as one continuous flexible piece.\\
316 - This is fun.\\
317 - Mm-hmm.\\
318 - Playing with Popsicle sticks,     exploring ways to store kinetic energy.\\
319 - It's like preschool all over again.\\
320 - Except now if I eat paste, it's because I want to,     not because Craig Schultz is making me.\\
321 - Hey, can I ask you a question?\\
322 - Is it, “Where was the teacher?”     She was in the bathroom smoking, that's where.\\
323 - It wasn't, but I'm glad to see you've moved on.\\
324 - I was gonna ask if being married felt any different.\\
325 - Oh.\\
326 - Uh...\\
327 - not really.\\
328 - Sorry.\\
329 - That probably wasn't the answer you were looking for.\\
330 - No, actually it is.\\
331 - I mean, Sheldon and I are in a really great place right now,     and I just, I don't want anything to mess that up.\\
332 - Mm-hmm.\\
333 - You do remember you're here     because he kicked you out of your apartment?\\
334 - Yes.\\
335 - His work is important to him.\\
336 - It's one of the things I find     the sexiest about him.\\
337 - Well, that and...\\
338 - Aah!\\
339 - ...his butt.\\
340 - And then I was thinking about     inventing a new dark matter particle     to evade the omega baryon constraints,     but that just seems like something     anyone could come up with.\\
341 - Mm.\\
342 - Agreed.\\
343 - (clears throat)\\
344 - You know what's blowing my mind?\\
345 - Somebody thought about putting cheese in this crust.\\
346 - I just wish I could find something that excites me.\\
347 - You do understand that crust doesn't normally     come with cheese in it?\\
348 - Okay, all right, look.\\
349 - What got you excited about dark matter in the first place?\\
350 - Well, I left string theory,     which I'd been working on for a long time,     and everyone was talking about how cool dark matter was,     and I thought, “Well, sure, I'll give that a whirl”"     So it's your rebound science?\\
351 - What's that?\\
352 - Well, not the science you spend the rest of your life with,     but the one you use to make yourself feel pretty again.\\
353 - Well, if I'm being honest,     I never forgot about string theory.\\
354 - It's remarkable.\\
355 - It's the closest we've come to a theory of everything,     something even Einstein couldn't figure out.\\
356 - Well, if he couldn't figure it out, maybe it's just wrong.\\
357 - But it's so elegant.\\
358 - I mean, look, string theory posits     that the fundamental particles we see in three dimensions     are actually strings embedded in multidimensional space-time.\\
359 - Interesting.\\
360 - So that would mean...\\
361 - that...\\
362 - Can't do this by myself, buddy.\\
363 - (keyboard keys clacking rapidly)\\
364 - What is happening?\\
365 - I was trying not to wake you.\\
366 - Did it work?\\
367 - Sorry.\\
368 - I just realized,     now that I'm not in the band, I can focus on my own music.\\
369 - You know?\\
370 - Go solo.\\
371 - You said you were taking a break from the band     to help with me and the baby.\\
372 - Yes, and write an astronaut musical.\\
373 - Picture this.\\
374 - The curtain opens.\\
375 - There's a lone astronaut floating     in the inky blackness of space.\\
376 - Maybe wires, maybe fog.\\
377 - I'll let the director figure that out.\\
378 -  I really don't know when \\
379 -  I'll run out of oxy... gen. \\
380 - Good news!\\
381 - I'm back in the band!\\
382 - So, Bernadette doesn't mind?\\
383 - It was her idea!\\
384 - So it's sort of like a guitar string,     but instead of making an actual sound,     each vibration is a different particle.\\
385 - Precisely.\\
386 - And when you express it in    dimensions,     Einstein's relativity equations pop out.\\
387 - Does that sound like a coincidence?\\
388 - It does not.\\
389 - Yup.\\
390 - That's what I think.\\
391 - So, so, did we do it?\\
392 - Did we just solve string theory?\\
393 - Oh.\\
394 - (laughs)\\
395 - I appreciate your enthusiasm,     but this is not the sort of thing     we can figure out in a night.\\
396 - People have been stuck on this for decades.\\
397 - Well, decades?\\
398 - Really?\\
399 - It's-it's a string.\\
400 - How hard can it be?\\
401 - It's straight, it's in a loop,     it gets knotted up with other strings.\\
402 - Uh...\\
403 - Well, actually there are no knots     in anything greater than four dimensions.\\
404 - Ooh, unless     we get around that by considering them as sheets.\\
405 - You know, topologically speaking,     that has a lot of interesting possibilities.\\
406 - See?\\
407 - How long did that take me, like a minute?\\
408 - Thought you were getting us dinner.\\
409 - Sorry.\\
410 - I had to stop at Sheldon's     and help him solve string theory.\\
411 - What?\\
412 - Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.\\
413 - That's cute, but you can't have knots     in more than four dimensions.\\
414 - Mm, you can if you consider them sheets.\\
415 - Good night.\\
416 - What up, my Hebrews and She-brews?!\\
417 - We are Footprints on the Moon.\\
418 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Toby, today you are a man,     and you will face many obstacles in life.\\
419 - And some of those obstacles are gonna feel like boulders.\\
420 - This first song is about the greatest boulder     in the history of cinema.\\
421 - One, two, three.\\
422 - (rock music playing)\\
423 -  Alone in my temple in the middle of Peru \\
424 -  A giant stone ball with nothing to do \\
425 -  But if you steal my idol \\
426 -  I will roll right over you \\
427 -  'Cause I'm six tons of granite \\
428 -  And micaceous schist \\
429 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite \\
430 -  And micaceous schist \\
431 - (shouting):  I'm gonna crush you, I'm gonna mush you \\
432 -  You took my idol, I'm homicidal \\
433 -  Gonna roll over you till your brains come out \\
434 -  And your bones will crunch and your blood will spout! \\
435 - I'm not just a rock, baby. I'm a boulder.\\
436 - (yelling wildly)\\
437 -  'Cause I'm six tons of granite \\
438 -  And micaceous schist \\
439 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite \\
440 -  And micaceous schist \\
441 -  Yeah, I'm six tons of granite... 
\subsection {Episode 14: The Separation Triangulation}
1 - Space is the mirror of the soul.\\
2 - Are we looking beyond, or are we looking within?\\
3 - I'm looking at my shoes.\\
4 - This is making me a little motion sick.\\
5 - When we gaze out at the immensities of space,    we understand them because there are immensities    within us as well.\\
6 - I'm Dr.\\
7 - Rajesh Koothrappali,    and thank you for taking a walk with me...\\
8 - through the stars.\\
9 - That pause gets longer every show.\\
10 - I believe...\\
11 - you're right.\\
12 - Hey.\\
13 - Can I get a picture with you?\\
14 - Absolutely.\\
15 - And if you post it on social media,     I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet."     (laughs)\\
16 - Thank you.\\
17 - The show was great.\\
18 - Well, I can't take all the credit.\\
19 - I have pretty good co-stars.\\
20 - The stars.\\
21 - Do you say that to everyone?\\
22 - Only to beautiful women.\\
23 - And okay women.\\
24 - Okay.\\
25 - Uh, just to clarify: you're the first kind.\\
26 - Okay.\\
27 - Thanks for coming.\\
28 - What did you handsome gentlemen think of the show?\\
29 - Uh, you can turn it off now.\\
30 - It's sweet of you to say, but I don't think I can.\\
31 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
32 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
33 -  The Earth began to cool   \\
34 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
35 -  We built the Wall \\
36 -  We built the pyramids   \\
37 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery  \\
38 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
39 -  Bang!       \\
40 - Look at this cute picture of Halley in the bath.\\
41 - Aw, that's great.\\
42 - Want me to send it to you?\\
43 - No, on your phone it's cute, on my phone it's a crime.\\
44 - I also have a pretty cute picture to share.\\
45 - WOLOWITZ: What is that?\\
46 - An equation.\\
47 - Isn't it perfect?\\
48 - Sometimes I just stare at it,     and I think "I can't believe that came out of me."     Well, since we're sharing pictures,     I have one to contribute.\\
49 - Please don't let it be you and your dog in the bathtub.\\
50 - It's not.\\
51 - But don't swipe.\\
52 - What are we looking at here?\\
53 - Well, that's me and a beautiful woman     and my watch showing the time as  :   in the morning.\\
54 - So, state's exhibit "A"?\\
55 - No.\\
56 - I met her at the planetarium a few days ago,     and she invited me out for a drink.\\
57 - Oh, good for you.\\
58 - H-Hey,     w-what's the Hindi word for "dog"?\\
59 - Kutta. You kutta. Bow-bow.     (chuckles)\\
60 - That's Hindi for woof-woof.\\
61 - I am seeing her again tonight.\\
62 - You know, I also have a date tonight.\\
63 - But don't worry, it's not another woman.\\
64 - It's string theory.\\
65 - Bow-bow.     Sorry, he's a kutta, you're not.\\
66 - (keys clatter)\\
67 - Hi.\\
68 - Hello.\\
69 - What you doing?\\
70 - Oh, taking another picture with my baby.\\
71 - Look how big he got.\\
72 - It's fun to see you this excited.\\
73 - Aw, thank you, that's so...\\
74 - (stammers)\\
75 - Don't sit there!\\
76 - What, what?\\
77 - I, uh-- sorry.\\
78 - I-It's part of my organization system.\\
79 - That's-that's where those papers go.\\
80 - Okay.\\
81 - Um, how about if I just...\\
82 - slide this notebook...\\
83 - Eh...\\
84 - You know what, it's fine.\\
85 - I'll just be in the bedroom.\\
86 - No, no.\\
87 - Uh, this is your apartment, too.\\
88 - Uh, look, I'll-I'll stop for the night     and clean this up.\\
89 - Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.\\
90 - I know.\\
91 - See, I'm trying this new technique     where I imagine how I would feel in someone else's position.\\
92 - Y-You mean empathy?\\
93 - Oh, I thought I came up with it.\\
94 - Well, regardless, I-I appreciate the effort.\\
95 - Thank you.\\
96 - It's really hard.\\
97 - Morning.\\
98 - Good morning.\\
99 - Aw, you didn't have to cook me breakfast.\\
100 - Well, I wasn't sure how I did last night,      and I wanted to finish strong.\\
101 - You don't need to worry.\\
102 - Last night was great.\\
103 - Ah, well, you say that now,      but wait until you taste this.\\
104 - Oh, my God, this is amazing.\\
105 - Which is why I keep an omelet pan in the trunk of my car.\\
106 - (both chuckle)\\
107 - Well, thank you, it's delicious.\\
108 - My husband never cooked for me.\\
109 - Oh, uh, y-you were married.\\
110 - Yeah.\\
111 - Well, technically, I guess I still am.\\
112 - Is that "technically,"      like, the paperwork hasn't gone through,      or "technically,"      like, he's in the closet watching us right now?\\
113 - No, no, we're separated.\\
114 - Do you mind if we talk about something else?\\
115 - Of course.\\
116 - Uh, you know, my secret to making great omelets is that      I beat the egg whites separately.\\
117 - Speaking of which, how long have you been separated?\\
118 - About two weeks.\\
119 - That is not a lot of weeks.\\
120 - In fact, that's the bare minimum to get to the plural "weeks."      Doesn't matter.\\
121 - He moved out, I moved on.\\
122 - Oh.\\
123 - Good.\\
124 - (chuckles)\\
125 - Yeah, do you mind me asking what he does for a living?\\
126 - He's a firefighter.\\
127 - Oh.\\
128 - Interesting.\\
129 - A potentially jealous man who's handy with an ax.\\
130 - (laughing): It's-it's okay, though.\\
131 - He's almost had two weeks to cool down.\\
132 - Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.\\
133 - Oh, I know this one.\\
134 - We're actually pushing it really hard.\\
135 - It treats mild dermatitis.\\
136 - Uh, correct.\\
137 - And who can it be prescribed to?\\
138 - Adults and children who have absolutely, for sure,      stopped growing.\\
139 - Right again.\\
140 - And what are the side effects?\\
141 - Oh, shoot, shoot.\\
142 - Mm, remember the mnemonic.\\
143 - Ah-- GRAVY, yes.\\
144 - G-R-A-V-Y.\\
145 - Okay, gastric distress, redness, a**l leakage,      vasculitis and yellow eyes.\\
146 - Oh, uh, so close.\\
147 - It's actually yellow discharge.\\
148 - Oh, right.\\
149 - That's why we went with "gravy."      Hello.\\
150 - Hey.\\
151 - Hi.\\
152 - He knows he doesn't live here anymore, right?\\
153 - Maybe he's experiencing memory loss because he took...\\
154 - (gasps)\\
155 - Flaxitrite.\\
156 - Yeah.\\
157 - - Thank you.\\
158 - - Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?\\
159 - Oh, I was just checking in on my old room      to see what you've done with it.\\
160 - Why?\\
161 - Well, I could use a place to work in the evenings, and...\\
162 - No.\\
163 - Well, it's just that      there's not a lot of space in our apartment...\\
164 - - No.\\
165 - Well, and I feel like Amy's been having...\\
166 - No.\\
167 - And since you're not...\\
168 - No.\\
169 - It's...\\
170 - No.\\
171 - No.\\
172 - That is our room now,      and we're gonna turn it into a gym.\\
173 - Do you really expect me to believe that?\\
174 - No.\\
175 - No.\\
176 - So I guess what's bugging me      is that they only broke up    days ago,      and now I'm dating her.\\
177 - So, am I, like, the good guy in my movie,      or the bad guy in their movie?\\
178 - Pretty sure you're the weird friend in our movie.\\
179 - (sighs)\\
180 - I like her, okay?\\
181 - I just, I-I don't know how I feel about      being the third wheel in a relationship.\\
182 - Says the guy in my bed with my wife.\\
183 - Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?\\
184 - He's apparently not happy about the breakup,      and based on the sweatpants he left at her place,      he's, like, a medium to large man.\\
185 - Maybe those are his "after the holiday" pants,      like you have.\\
186 - Oh, no.\\
187 - I mean, do you think      it's too soon for her to be dating?\\
188 - If you and Bernadette broke up,      like, how long would you wait?\\
189 - Oh, well, I don't even want to think...\\
190 - Eight days.\\
191 - What?\\
192 - Two days to cry.\\
193 - Six days to hit the gym.\\
194 - First of all, you already look amazing.\\
195 - Aw, that's sweet.\\
196 - I'm gonna give him an extra day of crying.\\
197 - The answer is still no.\\
198 - You can say we wouldn't know you're here, but we'd know.\\
199 - Because you'd be here!\\
200 - (groans)\\
201 - So, who was that?\\
202 - I can't believe you hung up on me!\\
203 - What the hell?\\
204 - What are you doing here?\\
205 - I am proving you wrong.\\
206 - I've been working back there for hours.\\
207 - You had no idea.\\
208 - (stammers)\\
209 - Do something.\\
210 - What the hell?\\
211 - What are you doing here?\\
212 - I-I am trying to respect Amy.\\
213 - Okay, look,      you have an office at work.\\
214 - Why don't you go there?\\
215 - I can't go to the office every time I have a brilliant thought.\\
216 - I'd basically be living there.\\
217 - Sounds good, do that.\\
218 - Yeah...\\
219 - No.\\
220 - No, the campus isn't safe at night.\\
221 - There's raccoons and undergrads just walking around      like they own the place.\\
222 - Look.\\
223 - I need somewhere to work in the evenings.\\
224 - You have a space you aren't using.\\
225 - Just take a look at my proposal.\\
226 - (groans)\\
227 - What is this?\\
228 - A rental agreement.\\
229 - I will only use the room for work.\\
230 - I-I won't sleep here, I won't eat your food,      I won't even use your bathroom.\\
231 - So you can just walk in any time of the day or night?\\
232 - Well, he does that now.\\
233 - At least this way we'll get paid.\\
234 - I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,      and thank you for taking a walk with me...\\
235 - ...through the stars.\\
236 - I-I think that one was too long.\\
237 - Yeah, you're right.\\
238 - I totally felt it.\\
239 - Should we, uh, run it again?\\
240 - Please, God, no.\\
241 - - Hey.\\
242 - - Hey.\\
243 - Can I help you?\\
244 - Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?\\
245 - Really?\\
246 - You're not sure      which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?\\
247 - I am.\\
248 - I was just trying not to be racist.\\
249 - I'm Nell's husband.\\
250 - Oh, uh...\\
251 - h-here's the thing-- I didn't know      that she was married until after...\\
252 - After what?\\
253 - I'm...\\
254 - I'm really sorry.\\
255 - Well, that doesn't make me feel better.\\
256 - Wh-What would make you feel better?\\
257 - I want you to stop seeing my wife.\\
258 - Done.\\
259 - Nice to meet you.\\
260 - Bye.\\
261 - What am I gonna do?\\
262 - (cries)\\
263 - Hey, buddy, do-do you want to talk?\\
264 - I thought we were gonna start a family.\\
265 - Next thing I know, it's over.\\
266 - (cries)\\
267 - It's gonna be okay.\\
268 - How is it gonna be okay?\\
269 - You're sleeping with my wife.\\
270 - I mean, besides that.\\
271 - Can I get you anything?\\
272 - A glass of water?\\
273 - A laser show?\\
274 - No, thank you.\\
275 - Oh, good.\\
276 - 'Cause I don't, I don't even know how to turn it on.\\
277 - I'm sorry.\\
278 - I shouldn't have come here.\\
279 - I guess I just wanted to see who she replaced me with.\\
280 - Don't say that.\\
281 - What you two had was special.\\
282 - No one can replace you.\\
283 - Did she say that?\\
284 - No.\\
285 - (whispering): I should go, right?\\
286 - (whispering): Stay.\\
287 - Okay, I'll call you later.\\
288 - Look, if it makes you feel any better,      I barely know her.\\
289 - And she had s*x with you?\\
290 - Nell tells me you're a fireman.\\
291 - What's that like?\\
292 - (suspenseful music playing over television)\\
293 - Okay, I-I-I'm really uncomfortable      with him back in that room.\\
294 - Why?\\
295 - He hasn't made a peep all day.\\
296 - Y-Y-You don't get it.\\
297 - All the years that we lived together,      he drove me crazy the whole time.\\
298 - And now he's not.\\
299 - Exactly.\\
300 - D-Don't look at me like that.\\
301 - It-it-it means he did it on purpose.\\
302 - It was a choice.\\
303 - That-That's like finding out Godzilla could've had Arby's      instead of Tokyo.\\
304 - I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.\\
305 - Not my point.\\
306 - Sheldon.\\
307 - Sheldon!\\
308 - I'm sorry.\\
309 - Am I being too loud?\\
310 - No, you're being perfect and you know it.\\
311 - Would you like me to be a less considerate tenant?\\
312 - No.\\
313 - Yes.\\
314 - What...?\\
315 - Stop messing with me!\\
316 - Hey, I was wrong.\\
317 - There's an Arby's in Okinawa.\\
318 - He was best friends with her older brother,      but he didn't even notice her.\\
319 - And then years afterward,      they randomly bumped into each other at the DMV.\\
320 - Two hours later, they were in love.\\
321 - You can really see the sparkle in his license photo.\\
322 - He told you all this at the planetarium?\\
323 - No, no, we went to House of Pies.\\
324 - He got banana cream.\\
325 - I got coconut.\\
326 - We did halfsies.\\
327 - You did pie halfsies with another man?\\
328 - You mean other than you?\\
329 - Yeah.\\
330 - I feel bad for him, Bernie.\\
331 - He's a, he's a good guy.\\
332 - Well, if you're uncomfortable with it,      maybe stop sleeping with his wife.\\
333 - I don't think the s*x is the problem.\\
334 - I know for a fact I was just okay.\\
335 - For the record, I'm the one      who introduced you to House of Pies.\\
336 - Sheldon?\\
337 - Oh, Leonard.\\
338 - Sorry, I just, I had to get out of there.\\
339 - What did he do now?\\
340 - Nothing.\\
341 - He's being a dream.\\
342 - Don't give me that look.\\
343 - That's how Penny looked at me.\\
344 - I'm not crazy.\\
345 - Penny and I have the same "You're crazy" look?\\
346 - That's kind of sweet.\\
347 - I know how to deal with Sheldon being Sheldon,      but Sheldon being a-a rational, thoughtful person?\\
348 - I'm clueless.\\
349 - I-It's like      when my mom called last year to sing happy birthday      and I-I just threw up.\\
350 - Well, if it gets to be too much,      you can always send him back over here.\\
351 - I made a deal with him,      and besides, that wouldn't be fair to you.\\
352 - Well, actually, I miss him.\\
353 - He's been over there a lot.\\
354 - Well, great.\\
355 - Tell him he can come back.\\
356 - I can't.\\
357 - He's thinking of me and my feelings      and trying to be respectful.\\
358 - That's what he's doing to me, too, the jerk!\\
359 - Stop that.\\
360 - Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's constipated look are the same.\\
361 - This is nice.\\
362 - It is.\\
363 - She used to kiss me like that.\\
364 - You okay?\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - Yeah, I'm sorry.\\
367 - Yeah.\\
368 - (crying): Oh, God, I'm so alone.\\
369 - Sorry, I can't do this.\\
370 - What's going on?\\
371 - I met Oliver the other day.\\
372 - Wait, you tracked down my husband?\\
373 - No, that would be weird.\\
374 - He tracked me down, then we spent the evening together.\\
375 - I don't believe this.\\
376 - He-he only did it because he cares about you.\\
377 - No, he did it because he's possessive and jealous.\\
378 - Really?\\
379 - I didn't get that at all.\\
380 - He made me feel very comfortable.\\
381 - Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.\\
382 - You know, I don't think that you're being very fair to him.\\
383 - You're taking his side?\\
384 - No, but I should point out that he did offer      to go to counseling, so at least one of you is trying.\\
385 - You're crazier than he is.\\
386 - I'll tell you what, just give him one more chance      and if it doesn't work out,      I'll be happy to keep sleeping with you.\\
387 - You would?\\
388 - Either way, you've got yourself a fella.\\
389 - Like, how nice is that?\\
390 - Hey, Sheldon.\\
391 - Hello.\\
392 - Hey.\\
393 - So, your contract provides for a three-day trial period,      and I don't think this is working out.\\
394 - So, to put it in legal terms,      the party of the first part would like      the party of the second part to get out.\\
395 - What time does the trial period end?\\
396 - :  , noon.\\
397 - Yeah-- what does it say after that?\\
398 - Eastern Standard Time.\\
399 - That was three hours ago.\\
400 - And, uh, since you didn't exercise      your right to revoke, I exercised my right to extend,      triggering this long-form rental agreement...\\
401 - ...of which you're already in violation.\\
402 - This is just a-a bunch of paper.\\
403 - You can't enforce this.\\
404 - Hire a lawyer.\\
405 - Let's find out.\\
406 - This is not happening.\\
407 - Be that as it may,      page nine says that you have to provide me      with lemon-flavored sparkling waters, so...\\
408 - chop-chop.\\
409 - Hey, how'd it go?\\
410 - Well, apparently he's not leaving      and I have to go get him sparkling water.\\
411 - Why are you smiling?\\
412 - I don't know.\\
413 - It just feels right.\\
414 - ...to the stars.\\
415 - Hey.\\
416 - Hey, buddy.\\
417 - I talked to Nell.\\
418 - She was pretty upset after you left.\\
419 - Yeah, I'm sorry.\\
420 - No.\\
421 - No, no, no.\\
422 - She told me that you said something so creepy      that I seemed great in comparison.\\
423 - I know exactly what it was.\\
424 - I...\\
425 - no, actually,      there was a couple of things it could've been.\\
426 - Whichever one it was, it was creepy.\\
427 - Anyway, uh, I went over to comfort her,      and we talked, and I think we're gonna give it another chance.\\
428 - I am so happy for you!\\
429 - Hey-hey-hey.\\
430 - Hey, uh, we should celebrate.\\
431 - House of Pies?\\
432 - You know it.\\
433 - Should we invite Nell?\\
434 - - Do we have to?\\
435 - - Nah.
\subsection {Episode 15: The Novelization Correlation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - So, Leonard, tell everyone your news.\\
3 - Oh, uh, I am starting a book.\\
4 - That would be big news from Penny,   but you've read a book before.\\
5 - He means he's writing a book.\\
6 - I do.\\
7 - It's something I've been thinking about for a long time.\\
8 - Yeah.\\
9 - It's about a brilliant physicist   who solves crimes using science.\\
10 - Oh, Leonard...\\
11 - It's not about you!\\
12 - Oh, boy.\\
13 - What?\\
14 - They cast the new Professor Proton.\\
15 - Is it Sheldon?\\
16 - Not exactly.\\
17 - SHELDON: Wheaton!\\
18 - It's Wil Wheaton.\\
19 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
20 - I thought we were having dinner at Leonard and Penny's.\\
21 - Oh, no.\\
22 - No, they're watching the new Professor Proton.    I-I can't keep Wil Wheaton off the Internet,    but I can keep him off my retinas.\\
23 - So, you're just gonna sit here by yourself and do nothing?\\
24 - Of course not.\\
25 - I'm going to write mean comments about Wil's show online.\\
26 - Well, you can't criticize something you haven't seen.\\
27 - I'm sorry, are you familiar with the Internet?\\
28 - Well, what if I watch it with you?\\
29 - Maybe I won't like it and we can complain about it together.\\
30 - Get your own thing to complain about.\\
31 - Oh, trust me, I've got one.\\
32 - Look, at least if you watch it,    maybe you can find more specific things to criticize.\\
33 - Oh, that is a good point.\\
34 - Criticisms are more hurtful when they're specific.\\
35 -  Grab your goggles \\
36 -  Lab coat on \\
37 -  Here he comes, Professor Proton. \\
38 - Hey, everybody.\\
39 - I'm Professor Proton.\\
40 - Welcome to the show.\\
41 - Today I will be teaching you    how to make a real hovercraft using common household items.\\
42 - Darn it, I do like objects that hover.\\
43 - All you will need is a CD,    a bottle cap, a balloon, and some super glue.\\
44 - Oh, no!\\
45 - I have all those things!\\
46 - Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
47 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
48 -  The Earth began to cool \\
49 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
50 -  We built the Wall \\
51 -  We built the pyramids \\
52 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
53 -  That all started with a big bang \\
54 -  Bang! \\
55 - (typewriter clacking)\\
56 - - Hey.\\
57 - - Hi.\\
58 - (typewriter dings)\\
59 - What's that noise?\\
60 - Oh, it's my new keyboard.\\
61 - (chuckles)\\
62 - It looks and sounds like an old-fashioned typewriter.\\
63 - It makes me feel like a real novelist.\\
64 - You poured yourself a Scotch.\\
65 - (stutters)\\
66 - Apple juice.\\
67 - Oh.\\
68 - But unsweetened,    like Hemingway used to drink.\\
69 - Ah.\\
70 - - So, how's the book coming along?\\
71 - - Uh, good.\\
72 - I just wrote the part where the hero,    hotshot physicist Logan Dean, arrives at CERN.\\
73 - Oh, is he based on you?\\
74 - Uh, kind of.\\
75 - But he can eat dairy products    without having to leave the room.\\
76 - Yeah, that's smart, because CERN is in Switzerland    and there's a lot of cheese there.\\
77 - Hmm.\\
78 - Uh, believe me, that is a plot point later.\\
79 - Well, I'm excited to read it whenever you're ready.\\
80 - Thank you.\\
81 - Oh.\\
82 - Oh!\\
83 - I just thought of the murder weapon!\\
84 - Swiss army knife?\\
85 - (laughs)\\
86 - No.\\
87 - (laughs)\\
88 - That's way better.\\
89 - Look, it works!\\
90 - We did it!\\
91 - See, there was a reason to keep that TurboTax CD.\\
92 - Yeah.\\
93 - A CD-ROM?\\
94 - More like "CD-vroom."    Do you feel bad you told Wil Wheaton    that you'd be his enemy if he did this show?\\
95 - No.\\
96 - I feel bad    I'm engaged to somebody that would point that out.\\
97 - WHEATON: It's time for Professor Proton's    science joke of the day.\\
98 - Why can you not trust atoms?\\
99 - Hmm.\\
100 - Because they make up everything.\\
101 - (laughs): Oh, that's funny!\\
102 - Yeah, because they do.\\
103 - They make up everything.\\
104 - (doorbell rings)\\
105 - Oh, I wonder who that could be.\\
106 - Just when I thought this couldn't get any better,     Wil has introduced suspense into the show.\\
107 - Hey, it's real NASA astronaut, Howard Wolowitz!\\
108 - What?!\\
109 - Hey, Professor Proton.\\
110 - Hey, thanks for being here.\\
111 - No problem.\\
112 - I'm on my "launch" break.\\
113 - How could Wil ask Howard to be on his show and not me?\\
114 - Well, he is an astronaut.\\
115 - And he didn't start an online petition to get Wil fired.\\
116 - But why wouldn't Howard tell me?\\
117 - Well, because he probably worried     that you'd be a big baby about it.\\
118 - All those answers make a lot of sense.\\
119 - Thank you, Amy.\\
120 - That helps.\\
121 - And then, when the lights come back on     in the supercollider room, Dr.\\
122 - Logan Dean makes     two important discoveries: a gluino     (gruffly): and murder.\\
123 - Oh, gluino.\\
124 - That's exciting.\\
125 - (gruffly): And murder.\\
126 - (gruffly): I heard you.\\
127 - The first time.\\
128 - I don't know which Hemsworth is playing Logan Dean,     but I know it's a Hemsworth.\\
129 - Well, Logan's actually based on me.\\
130 - So a young Paul Giamatti.\\
131 - Well, I have to finish writing it     before they can make it into a movie,     and I still have a few things to figure out.\\
132 - You should talk to Bernadette.\\
133 - Since she's been on bed rest, she's binged,     like, every detective show in the world.\\
134 - Oh, there was a funny detective show in India called Karamchand.     He had an assistant named Kitty,     and he was always saying, "Shut up, Kitty!"     Sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi     and don't think of women as having feelings.\\
135 - Hello.\\
136 - - Hey.\\
137 - - Hey.\\
138 - - Hi.\\
139 - Howard, I want you to know that I forgive you.\\
140 - I'll take it.\\
141 - What's he forgiving you for?\\
142 - Don't care.\\
143 - Clean slate.\\
144 - Happy Yom Kippur to me.\\
145 - I know that you were on Wil's show,     and I know why you didn't tell me.\\
146 - Do you?\\
147 - Because you were afraid     that I would be difficult and annoying about it.\\
148 - (chuckles)\\
149 - I hope your book has a twist     as surprising as that.\\
150 - It doesn't.\\
151 - I thought you were boycotting Wil's show.\\
152 - I was, but I decided to give it a shot,     and I actually enjoyed it.\\
153 - Just out of curiosity, how did you come to be on the show?\\
154 - Did he ask you?\\
155 - Did you ask him?\\
156 - Did you just show up on the set and ring that doorbell?\\
157 - Sheldon, if you want to be on the show,     you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.\\
158 - That would be the mature thing to do.\\
159 - Let's put a pin in that and keep thinking.\\
160 - Ooh.\\
161 - What?\\
162 - What?\\
163 - Which part?\\
164 - That was just the baby kicking.\\
165 - Got it.\\
166 - (chuckles)\\
167 - - But this is good so far, really good.\\
168 - - Yeah?\\
169 - Yeah.\\
170 - I have no idea who the killer is.\\
171 - Oh, great.\\
172 - Me, neither.\\
173 - So, does Penny know you based a character on her?\\
174 - What character?\\
175 - Ilsa, the head of the institute.\\
176 - That's clearly Penny.\\
177 - No, it's not.\\
178 - Really?\\
179 - Confident, ball-busting beauty     who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?\\
180 - Trust me, that describes more women than you think.\\
181 - "He looked at the stunning woman who was his boss and said..."     It's murder.\\
182 - Figure that out yourself, genius?\\
183 - Okay, no need to be snarky.\\
184 - Who would want to kill him?\\
185 - Could be anyone.\\
186 - Dr. Silvers.\\
187 - Dr.\\
188 - Prekash.\\
189 - Hans the janitor.\\
190 - But the door is locked,     so it has to be someone in this room.\\
191 - Wow, you are on fire.\\
192 - Maybe it is a little like Penny.\\
193 - Any chance she'll be flattered?\\
194 - I don't know.\\
195 - She's pretty mean.\\
196 - Ilsa or Penny?\\
197 - Exactly.\\
198 - Oh, hey, Howard.\\
199 - What's up?\\
200 - I'm so sorry.\\
201 - What for?\\
202 - Hello.\\
203 - Hello, Sheldon.\\
204 - I suppose you've come here to tell me     that you've moved me to your super secret enemies list.\\
205 - I don't have a super secret enemies list.\\
206 - I'm not a Bond villain.\\
207 - I'm just a regular guy,     with a regular enemies list.\\
208 - Which, by the way, you are no longer on.\\
209 - Really?\\
210 - Well, that is something.\\
211 - It's not something that I care about, but it is something.\\
212 - He's trying to say he's sorry.\\
213 - I am.\\
214 - I watched your show, and it's really good.\\
215 - Aw, thank you.\\
216 - And I regret how hard I was on you.\\
217 - I want you to know     that being on the Professor Proton show     has been a childhood dream of mine.\\
218 - So, if you're ever looking     for any more scientist guests, I hope you'll consider me.\\
219 - I appreciate that, Sheldon, and I'll keep it in mind.\\
220 - You know, actually...\\
221 - Yay!\\
222 - Uh...\\
223 - No.\\
224 - No.\\
225 - I want to have     more female scientists represented on the show,     and I thought maybe Amy might be interested?\\
226 - (stutters)\\
227 - Or...\\
228 - wouldn't it be nice     to have us both on, to show that     even female scientists can land a man?\\
229 - (sighs)\\
230 - I said "sorry."     So, what do you think?\\
231 - I like it.\\
232 - I can't wait to see who the killer is.\\
233 - Is it that Ilsa girl?\\
234 - She seems pretty mean.\\
235 - But adorably mean,     like a baby lion?\\
236 - No, regular mean, like a regular lion.\\
237 - But it seems pretty accurate, considering who you based it on.\\
238 - Huh.\\
239 - And who do you think that is?\\
240 - But the door is locked,     so it has to be someone in this room.\\
241 - Wow.\\
242 - You are on fire.\\
243 - Oh.\\
244 - Y...\\
245 - Bernadette.\\
246 - Yeah, sure.\\
247 - Each one of you had a motive.\\
248 - Who died and made you detective?\\
249 - He did.\\
250 - I think you're neglecting your own motive,     a massive inferiority complex.\\
251 - It's not massive.\\
252 - It's just average-sized.\\
253 - I don't mean to interrupt, but somebody's tracking     blood everywhere, so-- never mind, it's me.\\
254 - You say we're all suspects.\\
255 - How do we know you're not the killer?\\
256 - I have an alibi.\\
257 - Yeah.\\
258 - He's not smart enough to pull off a murder like this.\\
259 - It's pretty obvious: blonde, mean, glasses.\\
260 - It doesn't say "glasses." Oh, really?\\
261 - (stammers)\\
262 - But it will, because Ilsa does.\\
263 - And you know who else wears them?\\
264 - (clicks tongue)\\
265 - Bernadette.\\
266 - And-and that's her, cause it's,     it's totally, it's totally her.\\
267 - Oh, Amy.\\
268 - Good, you're here.\\
269 - Hi.\\
270 - What's up?\\
271 - How would you like to be on television?\\
272 - Is it gonna be a news story     where I have to say you were quiet and kept to yourself     and I'm as shocked as anyone?\\
273 - No, it's not.\\
274 - Wil Wheaton wants you to be on Professor Proton.     That's nice, but I'm not really interested.\\
275 - What do you mean?\\
276 - But he wants to talk about women in science.\\
277 - You're a woman, you're in science.\\
278 - You go, girl.\\
279 - I'm all for promoting women in science,     but I don't really want to be on Wil's show.\\
280 - Is it because kids may be there,     and they're known carriers of head lice?\\
281 - I get that.\\
282 - Sure, that's the reason.\\
283 - Wait a minute.\\
284 - You're always bragging that lice aren't attracted to you     because your scalp is so oily.\\
285 - That was on your dating profile.\\
286 - Okay, look,     I know you have strong feelings about Professor Proton,     and I don't want to get in the middle of that.\\
287 - So you're not going to do something     just because you think it might upset me?\\
288 - Well, it's tricky,     because answering that question honestly     is one of the things I tend not to do because it upsets you.\\
289 - Well, that's very upsetting.\\
290 - Like I said.\\
291 - What other things don't you do because of me?\\
292 - Remember last week when we went     to that dueling piano bar I was so excited about?\\
293 - No.\\
294 - Well, now you're getting it.\\
295 - Boy, I don't know how people who aren't on bed rest     keep up with the Kardashians.\\
296 - Well, sometimes you have to read in your car     while your husband thinks you're working late.\\
297 - Speaking of which, he came by yesterday to show me his book.\\
298 - Oh, and-and what did you think?\\
299 - I liked it.\\
300 - Really?\\
301 - The Ilsa character didn't bother you?\\
302 - Oh, he was exaggerating.\\
303 - You're not really like that.\\
304 - Well, I know I'm not like that.\\
305 - The character was based on you.\\
306 - I don't know what to tell you.\\
307 - When I brought it up with Leonard, he said it was you.\\
308 - Well, when I brought it up, he...\\
309 - got all squirrelly and left the room.\\
310 - Son of a bitch.\\
311 - I just learned some very distressing news.\\
312 - Sometimes, Amy doesn't do things     because she's worried about how I'll react.\\
313 - First of all, it's not sometimes, it's always.\\
314 - Second, it's not Amy, it's everybody.\\
315 - And third, it's not news, it's well-established.\\
316 - Yeah.\\
317 - Like just now I wanted to get a croissant,     but I didn't want to hear you say, "Ooh, la, la."     So you're saying everyone walks on eggshells     to spare my feelings?\\
318 - No, of course not, because we don't want     to hear you complain about how much you hate the sound     of crunching eggshells.\\
319 - I don't want my relationship with Amy to be like that.\\
320 - Sheldon, Amy knew what she was getting into.\\
321 - You think?\\
322 - Yes, we warned her.\\
323 - Well, regardless, I can change.\\
324 - (both laugh)\\
325 - Sure.\\
326 - Yeah, of course you can.\\
327 - You know, everybody thinks I'm so predictable.\\
328 - Well, tomorrow I'm gonna show up at work     and do something no one will expect.\\
329 - Where a baseball cap backwards to prove your point?\\
330 - Yes, but which hat?\\
331 - Gryffindor.\\
332 - Well, now that you guessed it, I'm not gonna do it.\\
333 - Yeah, you will.\\
334 - Yeah.\\
335 - (scoffs)\\
336 - Looks like the bullet went right through you.\\
337 - Damn it, Logan.\\
338 - When are you gonna stop?\\
339 - Sorry.\\
340 - I didn't get my PhD in quitting.\\
341 - You're a physicist.\\
342 - What makes you think you can solve a crime?\\
343 - He's losing a lot of blood.\\
344 - Great.\\
345 - I'm gonna have to clean that up.\\
346 - You know what?\\
347 - A little soda water     might get that right out.\\
348 - We got to find some bandages.\\
349 - ILSA: No.\\
350 - There's no time.\\
351 - Does it hurt?\\
352 - Everything you do hurts.\\
353 - Then why do you keep coming back for more?\\
354 - (door opens)\\
355 - Hey.\\
356 - So this is what you think of me?\\
357 - Huh?\\
358 - I'm mean and everything I do hurts you?\\
359 - What are you talking about?\\
360 - I know I'm Ilsa.\\
361 - Wha...?\\
362 - That is crazy.\\
363 - You-you two are totally different.\\
364 - How?\\
365 - Well, you...\\
366 - She...\\
367 - Her name's Ilsa.\\
368 - You know what?\\
369 - It's fine.\\
370 - Write whatever you want.\\
371 - And by the way, Logan Dean can tell everyone he's five-eight,     but he's not fooling anybody!\\
372 - Are you sure that's the move you want to make?\\
373 - Absolutely.\\
374 - Okay.\\
375 - Checkmate.\\
376 - Oh, I did not see that coming.\\
377 - That's well played, Amy.\\
378 - What's going on?\\
379 - You beat me, and I am responding with humility and admiration.\\
380 - What does it look like?\\
381 - You let me win so you could show me     how emotionally mature you are, didn't you?\\
382 - Well, I couldn't wait for you to actually beat me;     that would take forever.\\
383 - I'm sorry.\\
384 - It's...\\
385 - I'm trying to show you     that I can change.\\
386 - I-I don't want you to miss out on things because of me.\\
387 - I know you don't.\\
388 - You know, and maybe somewhere out there,     there is a little girl who will see you on Wil's show     and realize that she, too, can grow up     to be a brilliant, amazing,     successful scientist.\\
389 - Thank you.\\
390 - Who is really terrible at chess.\\
391 - Got it.\\
392 - No, no, no.\\
393 - I mean really bad.\\
394 - What was your queen doing over there, going shopping?\\
395 - I mean, I-I didn't intend to write about Penny,     but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.\\
396 - I believe you mean "unconsciously," dear.\\
397 - Yeah, sure.\\
398 - You know, it would be nice     if you didn't correct me all the time.\\
399 - It would be nice if I didn't have to.\\
400 - Maybe this book of yours is a bad idea.\\
401 - What do you mean?\\
402 - Well, you're a physicist.\\
403 - What makes you think you can write a book?\\
404 - You're a physicist.\\
405 - What makes you think you can solve a crime?\\
406 - Got to go.\\
407 - I think you mean "have..."     Oh, Penny, good news.\\
408 - It's not you.\\
409 - What?\\
410 - Ilsa.\\
411 - It's not you.\\
412 - It's my mother.\\
413 - I've been writing about my mother!\\
414 - I think you're neglecting your own motive,     a massive inferiority complex.\\
415 - It's not massive.\\
416 - It's just average-sized.\\
417 - We got to find some bandages.\\
418 - There's no time.\\
419 - Does it hurt?\\
420 - Everything you do hurts.\\
421 - Then why do you keep coming back for more?\\
422 - Maybe you like it.\\
423 - I-- M-Maybe I do.\\
424 - WHEATON: Well, that is our show for today.\\
425 - And I want to say a very special thank you     to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here.\\
426 - It was a real pleasure having you.\\
427 - And you can feel that pleasure     because you don't have a lesion in your nucleus accumbens.\\
428 - I really hope I don't.\\
429 - All right, we'll see you next time!\\
430 - (Professor Proton theme music plays)\\
431 - Amy.\\
432 - You were glowing.\\
433 - (giggles)\\
434 - Oily scalp.\\
435 - I'm so proud of you.\\
436 - And I'm proud of you.\\
437 - Because you can't tell how jealous I am?\\
438 - No, no, no.\\
439 - I can.\\
440 - But I can tell how hard you're trying to keep it in.\\
441 - Really hard.\\
442 - I'm gonna go to bed.\\
443 - All right, I'm gonna go scream on the roof.\\
444 - - Love you.\\
445 - - Love you.\\
446 - (Sheldon screaming)\\
447 - A simile directly compares two things,     using the words “like” and “as”"     “I slept like a log”"     “I'm hungry as a horse”"     “Your love is like bad medicine.”     Exactly.\\
448 - That's Bon Jovi.

1 - Howie?\\
2 - Howie, wake up.\\
3 - It's time.\\
4 - Oh.\\
5 - Did your water break?\\
6 - No.\\
7 - Are you feeling any contractions?\\
8 - No.\\
9 - Wait.\\
10 - Well, where are you going?\\
11 - To the hospital.\\
12 - Today's my due date, and this crap needs to end now.\\
13 - Honey, babies don't always come on their due date.\\
14 - Halley was two weeks late.\\
15 - But this baby's a boy.\\
16 - They don't take as long to get ready.\\
17 - (laughs)\\
18 - What are you doing?\\
19 - I'm making the situation better with humor.\\
20 - Are you?\\
21 - Would you rather me make it better with magic?\\
22 - - Go back to sleep.\\
23 - - Ta-da!\\
24 - (snaps fingers)\\
25 - You know, I hear that s*x can induce labor.\\
26 - Anything for my family.\\
27 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
28 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
29 -  The Earth began to cool \\
30 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
31 -  We built the Wall \\
32 -  We built the pyramids \\
33 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
34 -  That all started with a big bang \\
35 -  Bang! \\
36 -  I believe today is Bernadette's due date.\\
37 - Yeah.\\
38 - How do you know that?\\
39 - Easy.\\
40 - weeks from the date of her last period.\\
41 - And why do you know that?\\
42 - Well, excuse me for taking an interest in people.\\
43 - (scoffs softly)\\
44 - So, any day now.\\
45 - Oh, I don't know.\\
46 - We went to the doctor this morning,      and she said it could still be another week or two.\\
47 - How's Bernadette holding up?\\
48 - It's pretty rough.\\
49 - She's having a hard time.\\
50 - Why are you smiling?\\
51 - I had s*x twice last night.\\
52 - That's not fair!\\
53 - She's on bed rest.\\
54 - She can't run away.\\
55 - It was her idea.\\
56 - She read that it can start labor.\\
57 - Hmm.\\
58 - Is that true?\\
59 - Well, I would have Googled it,      but I was busy taking my pants off.\\
60 - Yeah, not to brag, but Amy's last birthday      brought my coital tally up to four.\\
61 - Whatever you're doing, it's not bragging.\\
62 - - Hey, guys.\\
63 - - Hey.\\
64 - - Hey.\\
65 - - Hey.\\
66 - - Hey, I was just      talking about you.\\
67 - Oh, should I ask?\\
68 - You should not.\\
69 - I'm trying to get our grant proposal together.\\
70 - Any chance you've finished up those mechanical drawings?\\
71 - Oh, sorry.\\
72 - I was gonna do it last night,      but I got kind of busy.\\
73 - Yeah, you did.\\
74 - What are they talking about?\\
75 - I'll give you a hint.\\
76 - It's something that we have done four times.\\
77 - Watched La La Land?      What?\\
78 - No.\\
79 - No.\\
80 - I've not watched La La Land four times.\\
81 - If you find the soundtrack on my phone,      that's just 'cause our iTunes accounts are linked.\\
82 - Looks like I might have a little more time      before the baby gets here,      so why don't we just stay late and get it done?\\
83 - Well, I don't want you to leave Bernadette alone.\\
84 - Oh, we can hang out and keep her company.\\
85 - - Yeah, absolutely.\\
86 - - See, see.\\
87 - Look at my Netflix queue.\\
88 - There's two documentaries      and the movie Friends with Benefits,      which I thought was a documentary      about employer health care plans.\\
89 - PENNY: Hey, Bernie, it's me.\\
90 - I let myself in.\\
91 - Hey.\\
92 - What are you doing?\\
93 - I thought you were supposed to be on bed rest.\\
94 - That's done, but I've been on stair rest      for the last    minutes.\\
95 - Here, let me help you.\\
96 - Yeah.\\
97 - If you really want to help, put on a rubber glove,      reach on up there and start pulling.\\
98 - I know you're joking, but I grew up on a farm.\\
99 - I'll do it.\\
100 - Oh, I just want this to be over.\\
101 - You know, when my yoga instructor was pregnant,      she told me there are tons of poses       that put her right into labor.\\
102 - I'll try,       but I feel like bendy poses are what got me into this mess.\\
103 - Okay, we're gonna start with some nice breathing exercises.\\
104 - (inhales, exhales)\\
105 - Sorry.\\
106 - I can't think of anything except how flat your belly is.\\
107 - Oh, thank you.\\
108 - Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.\\
109 - Okay, we go down...\\
110 - and back up.\\
111 - And back up!\\
112 - Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.\\
113 - Put that phone away!\\
114 - Smile.\\
115 - (camera clicks)\\
116 - I'm telling you, there's an acupressure point       right above your ankle that can induce contractions.\\
117 - All right, but just a warning.\\
118 - My feet are a little swollen.\\
119 - Oh, please, Bernadette.\\
120 - I'm sure this-- okay.\\
121 - What?\\
122 - Nothing.\\
123 - Your ankles look fine, and not at all       like I just popped open a can of crescent rolls.\\
124 - My mother believes that if you're not prepared mentally,       it can delay your body from going into labor.\\
125 - So what are you trying to say?\\
126 - It's my fault?\\
127 - (sighs)\\
128 - Raj is crazy.\\
129 - Your ankles aren't that gross.\\
130 - Hello.\\
131 - Let me guess.\\
132 - You're here to try to get me to go into labor.\\
133 - Oh, please.\\
134 - I'm disgusted when people sneeze,       and that's just stuff coming out of their nose.\\
135 - No.\\
136 - I am here to sit with you and keep you company.\\
137 - Oh, that's nice.\\
138 - Yeah, by playing the most complicated board game       ever invented: Campaign for North Africa.\\
139 - I bought it off eBay.\\
140 - It smells a little like chili, but all the pieces are there.\\
141 - Come on, baby.\\
142 - Get out here right now and I'll buy you a pony.\\
143 - Are there any engineers on the grant committee?\\
144 - I don't know.\\
145 - Why?\\
146 - I didn't have time to figure out       the three-input hydraulic manifold,       so this diagram is really just a flux capacitor       from Back to the Future.       I'm sorry this is on such short notice.\\
147 - Hey, I just wish I could be there when you present it.\\
148 - That's okay.\\
149 - It's more important that you spend time with Michael.\\
150 - Who's Michael?\\
151 - Uh, your son?\\
152 - No, it's not.\\
153 - (chuckles)\\
154 - My son doesn't have a name yet.\\
155 - Okay, well, then, Bernadette's son.\\
156 - I can't believe her.\\
157 - She knows I don't want to name the baby after her dad.\\
158 - - What did you want to name him?\\
159 - - I don't know.\\
160 - We were gonna wait until we saw what he looked like.\\
161 - Well, it's a baby.\\
162 - Her dad's a wrinkly bald man.\\
163 - That wasn't gonna break your way.\\
164 - Ah, come on!\\
165 - Welcome to the next five to eight weeks of your life.\\
166 - Sheldon, I said I didn't want to play your game.\\
167 - Well, then don't think of it as a game.\\
168 - Think of it       as a source of information       about one of the lesser known campaigns of World War II.\\
169 - You're right.\\
170 - That's so much better.\\
171 - I know, right?\\
172 - Okay, first, we need to roll to determine the weather.\\
173 - It's a desert.\\
174 - Isn't it gonna be hot?\\
175 - (humming)\\
176 - Yes.\\
177 - Michael?\\
178 - Really, you think we're naming him Michael?\\
179 - Not now, Howard.\\
180 - I'm in the middle of a game.\\
181 - You wish.\\
182 - You are hundreds of hours away from the middle.\\
183 - I can't believe you're trying to hijack our son's name.\\
184 - Bernie?\\
185 - BERNADETTE: This is as fast as I move!\\
186 - Calm down!\\
187 - So you're just gonna name him Michael?\\
188 - Were you even gonna tell me?\\
189 - I told you.\\
190 - When?\\
191 - Oh, right.\\
192 - That was Amy.\\
193 - What's wrong with Michael?\\
194 - It's my dad's name.\\
195 - I don't want to name our son after your father.\\
196 - I didn't want to say this, but he's dying.\\
197 - He is?\\
198 - Eventually.\\
199 - I mean, you see the way the man eats.\\
200 - Okay, is this the hormones,       or have you always been a lunatic?\\
201 - I don't even know anymore.\\
202 - Bernie, this is our kid's name.\\
203 - I think we should both agree.\\
204 - You're right.\\
205 - We both made this baby.\\
206 - Thank you.\\
207 - And I carried it, had to stay in bed for four months,       sacrificed my body and my job,       and soon it's gonna burst its way out of me       like the Kool-Aid Man.\\
208 - Exactly.\\
209 - Fifty-fifty.\\
210 - (quietly): I think I got Bernadette in trouble.\\
211 - Maybe we should go.\\
212 - I-I can't.\\
213 - She and I are playing Campaign for North Africa.\\
214 - (sighs)\\
215 - She doesn't want to play that.\\
216 - Hmm?\\
217 - Neither did the Egyptians, but that didn't stop Rommel.\\
218 - (door opens)\\
219 - Hey!\\
220 - I brought Chinese.\\
221 - And I brought Indian.\\
222 - What are you guys doing here?\\
223 - Sheldon texted and said       Bernadette wanted us all to come over.\\
224 - The game's best with five to ten players.\\
225 - Okay, if it's not Michael, then what do you want to name him?\\
226 - Harry, like Potter or Houdini.\\
227 - It doesn't bother you that I have an old boyfriend       named Harry?\\
228 - Okay.\\
229 - (clears throat)\\
230 - How 'bout Al or Max or...\\
231 - Ted or Kevin?\\
232 - Same answer.\\
233 - Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn.\\
234 - Penny's air force       is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.\\
235 - We're kind of busy.\\
236 - Oh. 'Kay.\\
237 - But you're being pretty rude.\\
238 - Everyone did come over to play this game with you.\\
239 - You know, I always thought Christian was a nice name.\\
240 - I don't know.\\
241 - Sounds a little too uncircumcised.\\
242 - Bernadette, it's your turn.\\
243 - What about Greg?\\
244 - All right, I'll just roll for you.\\
245 - Ooh!\\
246 - That is a good one!\\
247 - Your troops' morale rating is pretty high.\\
248 - Now, Leonard, as the defender,       we need to subtract your morale rating       from Bernadette's to get a final       adjusted morale rating for the assault.\\
249 - And I will just check the assault differential column.\\
250 - Ooh!\\
251 - Who said war was hell?\\
252 - Yeah, that's a rhetorical question.\\
253 - Sherman said it.\\
254 - What about Sherman?\\
255 - Like, Sherman Wolowitz.\\
256 - Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna take his mother to prom.\\
257 - Hey, Howard, you did that, right?\\
258 - I didn't take her.\\
259 - She chaperoned.\\
260 - (chuckles)\\
261 - We slow-danced once.\\
262 - What about Paul?\\
263 - Paul.\\
264 - Paul Wolowitz.\\
265 - I like it.\\
266 - Ooh, like "Koothra-Paul-i."       Okay, you ruined it.\\
267 - All right, that moves us on to the tactical shipping phase.\\
268 - Penny, I believe, as logistics commander, that's you.\\
269 - Okay.\\
270 - I surrender.\\
271 - Nice try, Penny.\\
272 - It takes more than everybody not enjoying it       to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.\\
273 - Sheldon, we're talking about something important here.\\
274 - (sighs)\\
275 - Fine.\\
276 - If you pick a baby name, can we get back to playing?\\
277 - Sure.\\
278 - All right, here we go.\\
279 - Ranatanata.\\
280 - You can't name him Ranatanata.\\
281 - Oh, right, it's a boy.\\
282 - That'd be ridiculous.\\
283 - (gasps)\\
284 - What about Ozymandias?\\
285 - Are you making these up or having a stroke?\\
286 - Ozymandias is from a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley.\\
287 - Oh, oh!\\
288 - Bysshe Wolowitz.\\
289 - Solved.\\
290 - Back to the game.\\
291 - Heyo!\\
292 - Sandstorm!\\
293 - Some people name their kids after places.\\
294 - Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?\\
295 - If you think that is better than Ozymandias Wolowitz,       then you have been breathing in the poisonous gas       that my troops illegally dispersed.\\
296 - Ooh!\\
297 - You okay?\\
298 - Uh, I think that was a contraction.\\
299 - Is it time?\\
300 - Do we need to go to the hospital?\\
301 - No.\\
302 - We've been through this before.\\
303 - My water hasn't even broken yet.\\
304 - Never mind your water.\\
305 - Has your mucus plug popped out?\\
306 - Ew, no!\\
307 - SHELDON: Oh, you're right.\\
308 - We probably would've heard that.\\
309 - It's not a champagne cork.\\
310 - Although that would be festive.\\
311 - You know what, maybe we should go.\\
312 - Did you have another contraction?\\
313 - No.\\
314 - I'm just worried that Sheldon's gonna say       "mucus plug" again.\\
315 - And I'm worried one's gonna hit me in the eye.\\
316 - Yep, it's time.\\
317 - Should we take two cars?\\
318 - Uh, actually, could you stay here and watch Halley?\\
319 - That way we don't have to wait for Bernadette's parents.\\
320 - Yeah, you guys go.\\
321 - We'll take care of her.\\
322 - You have nothing to worry about.\\
323 - Well, not nothing.\\
324 - There are U-boats approaching       the Suez Canal.\\
325 - It's too late for us.\\
326 - Go, go!\\
327 - Save yourselves!\\
328 - Suez?\\
329 - Birth?\\
330 - It's a big night for canals.\\
331 - How you feeling?\\
332 - Eh.\\
333 - But I am really excited to meet our son.\\
334 - Me, too.\\
335 - I thought I'd be super freaked out.\\
336 - But I'm ready for this.\\
337 - Well, not the part where you're in labor       and you squeeze my fingers till they turn blue.\\
338 - (chuckles)\\
339 - I'm sorry.\\
340 - That must be really painful for you.\\
341 - It is.\\
342 - I mean, last time, I...\\
343 - Okay,       I see what you're doing.\\
344 - Ooh, ooh, ooh.\\
345 - (groans, hisses)\\
346 - It's a big one.\\
347 - Just breathe.\\
348 - (moans, hisses)\\
349 - (panting)\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - Okay, I'm good.\\
352 - I'm sorry I tried to sneak the name past you.\\
353 - That's okay.\\
354 - I'm sorry I used up so many good names in college.\\
355 - I was really competitive with my roommate.\\
356 - Forget about it.\\
357 - (chuckles)\\
358 - Please.\\
359 - You know what,       maybe we're putting too much pressure on this.\\
360 - It doesn't matter what we name him.\\
361 - He's gonna be amazing.\\
362 - You're right.\\
363 - This kid is part you and part me.\\
364 - Yeah.\\
365 - He's gonna be smart and kind and funny.\\
366 - If he cracks five-foot-six, it'll be a miracle.\\
367 - I've always liked the name Elliott.\\
368 - Sorry, can't have it.\\
369 - That's my boy name.\\
370 - I said it first.\\
371 - It's not like calling dibs.\\
372 - Yes, it is.\\
373 - It's exactly like that.\\
374 - Dibs on Elliott.\\
375 - I-I'm just saying, we might get there first.\\
376 - You only have s*x once a year.\\
377 - I'll probably have s*x tonight.\\
378 - Fine, you can have Elliott.\\
379 - When did you pick out our kids' names?\\
380 - Remember that day you moved into the building?\\
381 - (chuckles)\\
382 - Yes.\\
383 - A non-creepy amount of time after that.\\
384 - Yeah, I like the name Elliott.\\
385 - That wasn't on my list, but I like it.\\
386 - We've heard your names.\\
387 - They're ridiculous.\\
388 - And I have a cousin named Dilip.\\
389 - Well, I wasn't going to give them any of the good names.\\
390 - I'm saving those for us.\\
391 - Really?\\
392 - You've thought about our kids?\\
393 - Of course.\\
394 - I think you and I will have exceptional children.\\
395 - Aw.\\
396 - Well, I think so, too.\\
397 - How many kids do you guys want?\\
398 - - Two.\\
399 - - What?\\
400 - - (stammers)\\
401 - Don't worry.\\
402 - I don't expect you to bear them all.\\
403 - I'm sure we can find a suitable uterus to rent.\\
404 - - No!\\
405 - - Uh-uh!\\
406 - We weren't thinking about you.\\
407 - Of course not.\\
408 - (grunts)\\
409 - I am going to the kitchen.\\
410 - Can I get anybody anything?\\
411 - Penny, nice glass of milk       and a multivitamin?\\
412 - SHELDON: Guys.\\
413 - Guys, wake up.\\
414 - Terrible news.\\
415 - Oh, my God.\\
416 - What, what, what?\\
417 - Is it the baby?\\
418 - No.\\
419 - No, no, we miscalculated       our unassigned armor class units.\\
420 - We need to start over.\\
421 - What?\\
422 - Oh, no, no, no, not from the beginning.\\
423 - Just from when the tanks started moving.\\
424 - (sighs)\\
425 - That was five hours ago.\\
426 - Mm, no.\\
427 - No, that was two hours ago.\\
428 - It only feels like five.\\
429 - What time is it?\\
430 - It's almost  :  .\\
431 - Don't you think we should've heard something?\\
432 - I'm sure they're fine.\\
433 - I'm calling them.\\
434 - (clears throat)\\
435 - (line ringing)\\
436 - Hey!\\
437 - (chuckles)\\
438 - Hey, everything okay?\\
439 - Yeah!\\
440 - The baby was born about an hour ago.\\
441 - (gasps)\\
442 - Dude, why didn't you call me?!\\
443 - (chuckles)\\
444 - The only way I would see my son for the first time       and immediately think "I need to call Raj"       is if he came out brown.\\
445 - You know, it can take some time for pigment to form.\\
446 - You're still not out of the woods.\\
447 - Congratulations!\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - Hey, what'd you name him?\\
450 - Neil Michael.\\
451 - Neil for Armstrong,       Gaiman, and Diamond.\\
452 - Michael because Bernie had to get six stitches.\\
453 - Neil-- that's cute.\\
454 - BERNADETTE: But we're calling him Michael!\\
455 - (sighs)\\
456 - I'm not gonna fight her.\\
457 - That kid's head was the size of a cantaloupe.

1 - Oh, my God, I can't believe how big Halley's getting.\\
2 - Yeah-- where's Howard?\\
3 - He's changing Michael.\\
4 - A-All done.\\
5 - You know, fun fact,   did you know baby boys can pee straight up?\\
6 - Grown-up boys, too.\\
7 - Why would we high-five that?\\
8 - So how are you guys?\\
9 - BERNADETTE: Really good.\\
10 - Except for when we went grocery shopping,    and the checkout lady asked when I was due.\\
11 - But you handled it well.\\
12 - (mouthing)\\
13 - Well, if you guys need help, I'd be happy to come over.\\
14 - Oh, thanks, but we're really trying to enjoy this family time    before we both go back to work.\\
15 - Okay, well, we all miss you.\\
16 - You guys, too.\\
17 - Bye.\\
18 - (Skype call ends)\\
19 - Ah.\\
20 - Boy, seeing them all together like that    has got my biological clock ticking like crazy.\\

22 - I do.\\

24 - Hi.\\

26 - Hey, guys.\\
27 - Hey.\\
28 - Good news, we have save the date cards.\\
29 - Oh.\\
30 - Huh, didn't go with my calligrapher.\\
31 - Interesting.\\
32 - What is this picture?\\
33 - Oh, it's an MRI of our brains photoshopped    to look like they're kissing.\\
34 - Is it too sexy?\\
35 - It's too something.\\
36 - Guys, May   , that's exciting.\\
37 - I know.\\
38 - Do you guys have    a location yet?\\
39 - 'Cause you don't have a lot of time.\\

50 - (whispering): Michael's out.\\
51 - So is Halley.\\
52 - Oh, my God, he's so cute.\\
53 - So is she.\\
54 - Switch?\\
55 - Yeah.\\
56 - Oh, my God, he's so cute.\\
57 - So is she.\\
58 - I just love them so much.\\
59 - Me, too.\\
60 - My heart feels like it's gonna explode.\\
61 - Of course, it's full of brisket, so it probably will.\\
62 - Oh, I didn't even know I was capable    of loving someone so much.\\
63 - More than me?\\
64 - Wha-- oh, uh...\\
65 - I'm just messing with you.\\
66 - I totally love them more than you.\\
67 - I get that.\\
68 - I would take a bullet for them.\\
69 - But I would get seriously mutilated for you.\\
70 - That's sweet.\\
71 - But you should know, if you got seriously mutilated,    I might dump you.\\
72 - You'd be crazy not to.\\
73 - Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.\\
74 - You know, I'm really happy with our wedding date.\\
75 - The month squared equals the square of the sum of the members    of the set of prime factors of the day.\\
76 - Isn't that romantic?\\
77 - Yes, it's like that Shakespeare sonnet,    “Shall I compare thee to a day    that's also a really weird math problem.”    It's a shame you're joking.\\
78 - That'd be a lovely reading at our ceremony.\\
79 - Well, we only have two months to find a venue,    and I had a thought.\\
80 - What about the Athenaeum club at Caltech?\\
81 - (gasps)\\
82 - Albert Einstein was a member there.\\
83 - It's beautiful.\\
84 - Yeah,    and Albert Einstein was a member there.\\
85 - It's close.\\
86 - And Albert Einstein was a member there.\\
87 - And Albert Einstein was a member there.\\
88 - Ah.\\
89 - Now you sound like a woman who wants to get married.\\
90 - So you're interested?\\
91 - Oh, of course.\\
92 - Yeah, but that club is extremely exclusive.\\
93 - You know, Leonard's been trying to get us in there for years,     but no luck.\\
94 - Well, that's odd.\\
95 - When I called, they said they'd be excited to give us a tour.\\
96 - Well, I suppose we can give it a look,     and if it doesn't work out, I hear that there is     a nearby Chinese restaurant that Einstein used to frequent.\\
97 - Or, we pick a place we like,     and don't worry about Einstein.\\
98 - Boy, reality TV is right; brides are crazy.\\
99 - So, how has it been, being home with two kids?\\
100 - Oh, tiring, but super rewarding.\\
101 - Oh, like Pilates, yeah, got it.\\
102 - Honestly, it's gonna be hard when we both go back to work.\\
103 - I've been thinking maybe it would be better     if one of us decided to stay home.\\
104 - I don't know, I was raised by servants, and look at me.\\
105 - I literally can't tell     if you think that's good or bad.\\
106 - Well, on one hand, they filled my tub with scented oils     and brought me honeyed sweets; on the other hand,     I spent my twenties incapable of talking to women.\\
107 - So you know, pros and cons.\\
108 - Here's my dilemma:     I...\\
109 - (sighs)\\
110 - kind of want to stay home.\\
111 - But Bernadette is a way better parent than I am.\\
112 - Wait, does Bernadette want to stay home?\\
113 - I don't know.\\
114 - She's really invested in her career,     and she's doing great.\\
115 - I think it should be me.\\
116 - Wow, I admire you, Howard.\\
117 - I-It would be hard for me     to buck traditional gender roles like that.\\
118 - Didn't you see Taylor Swift twice this month?\\
119 - Yeah, because she's hot, not because she sings my truth.\\
120 - Did Albert Einstein ever sit in any of these chairs?\\
121 - I think these are fairly new.\\
122 - But Stephen Hawking's eaten here a lot.\\
123 - Yeah, but he brings his own chair, you know?\\
124 - Well, it seems kind of perfect,     and it's close enough to your office,     so you can use the bathroom you like.\\
125 - Mm.\\
126 - I put a sticker over the auto-flush,     so it doesn't startle me.\\
127 - Here's my card.\\
128 - Why don't you two talk it over,     and I will check to see if our soup spoons     are “deeper than they are wide”"     What?\\
129 - Too deep is a ladle, not a spoon.\\
130 - I really like it.\\
131 - Mm.\\
132 - Oh, I must admit, I do, as well.\\
133 - I-- look at how somber all the men in these portraits are.\\
134 - I feel like that sets a good tone for our wedding.\\
135 - Is that Leonard?\\
136 - Oh, no, no, these are all dead, accomplished scientists.\\
137 - Leonard will only ever be one of those things.\\
138 - I mean, Leonard and Penny are right there.\\
139 - But he told me he checked on our membership just last week,     and we were still    th in line.\\
140 - I'm sure there's an innocent explanation     that won't ruin my day at all.\\
141 - Leonard.\\
142 - - Oh, hey.\\
143 - - Hey.\\
144 - How did you get in here?\\
145 - What do you mean?\\
146 - Leonard's a member.\\
147 - You told me it was incredibly exclusive.\\
148 - Y-Yeah, look, about that, I lied.\\
149 - Hey, wait, you told me it was exclusive, too.\\
150 - Mm-hmm.\\
151 - I avoided him and impressed you, all with the same lie.\\
152 - Damn, Hofstadter, didn't think you had it in you.\\
153 - Well, I'm not sure I know how I feel about this place now.\\
154 - Then don't turn around.\\
155 - Cooper!\\
156 - Oh, good, you're here.\\
157 - There's...\\
158 - (clears throat)\\
159 - something     I want to talk to you about.\\
160 - We're not putting a TV in the bathroom.\\
161 - That's how you get hemorrhoids.\\
162 - No, this is important.\\
163 - Uh, I was thinking maybe one of us should     stay home full-time, with the kids.\\
164 - Oh great, so I have to give up my job     and everything I've worked for?\\
165 - Actually, I was thinking I should stay home.\\
166 - Oh, so I have to abandon my children and go back to work,     while you get to stay home and bond with them?\\
167 - You just said you didn't want to.\\
168 - No, I don't want to have to, but if I want to, I should get to.\\
169 - Do you want to?\\
170 - Maybe I do.\\
171 - What if I also want to?\\
172 - Well, I don't know, we can't     both stay home.\\
173 - Don't you think you should go back to work,     because you make more money?\\
174 - Don't you think you should make more money?\\
175 - I think it's pretty sexist of you to say     a dad can't stay home with his children.\\
176 - You know what else is sexist, the phrase “suck it,”     yet, here we are.\\
177 - I can't believe Leonard lied to me.\\
178 - (stammers)\\
179 - What are we gonna find out next,     that he's not really lactose intolerant, hmm?\\
180 - He's just friends with an invisible trumpet player?\\
181 - I know you're upset, but if we want to book the Athenaeum,     we really should do it now, and then, I promise,     we'll have our whole lives to complain about Leonard.\\
182 - Aw, somebody got a head start on her vows.\\
183 - So do we agree?\\
184 - Do we want to get married there?\\
185 - I don't know.\\
186 - I mean, Einstein was a member.\\
187 - I like that.\\
188 - You know?\\
189 - But...\\
190 - Leonard's a member, and that really steams my clams.\\
191 - Oh, I love it when you're folksy.\\
192 - I'm just gonna call.\\
193 - On the other hand, shaming Leonard during our wedding     at the very place he betrayed me     does have a beautiful symmetry to it.\\
194 - That's nice, it'll be your first petty act as a married man.\\
195 - Uh-- oh, hi, Kathleen?\\
196 - Yeah, this is Amy from earlier.\\
197 - I'd like to go ahead and reserve May   .\\
198 - Although, it is our wedding.\\
199 - I-- maybe it shouldn't be all about revenge.\\
200 - Oh, I see.\\
201 - Okay, t-thanks.\\
202 - Someone booked our date.\\
203 - Uh...\\
204 - What?\\
205 - Who?\\
206 - Well, well, well.\\
207 - This is a pickle.\\
208 - Yes, so,     if you will just move your birthday party     to a different location, everything will be fine.\\
209 - Ugh, i-it's tricky.\\
210 - I don't want to move my party,     but I also don't want to help you--     oh, wait, I don't have a problem.\\
211 - No.\\
212 - I do.\\
213 - Yeah, you do.\\
214 - Morning.\\
215 - Hey, where you been?\\
216 - Oh, nowhere special.\\
217 - Just the park, the farmer's market,     then we hopped on the Gold Line to Chinatown     because it's important for the kids     to experience other cultures.\\
218 - What have you been doing?\\
219 - It's  :   a.m.\\
220 - Sleeping.\\
221 - Oh.\\
222 - So are the kids.\\
223 - I guess they take after you.\\
224 - You're just trying to prove that you'd do a better job than me.\\
225 - You're pretty sharp having just woken up.\\
226 - Howard, we both know you can't keep up this pace.\\
227 - By this afternoon you're gonna be passed out on the couch     and I'm gonna have three exhausted babies to deal with.\\
228 - Not true.\\
229 - I got this.\\
230 - You know, in fact, why don't you take the day off?\\
231 - Mm, fine.\\
232 - Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny.\\
233 - Take your time.\\
234 - Get a massage.\\
235 - You deserve it after all the sleep you've been getting.\\
236 - Maybe Barry will change his mind.\\
237 - Hmm?\\
238 - Oh, I doubt it.\\
239 - I said some pretty unprofessional things     about his work.\\
240 - I may have even used the “S” word.\\
241 - Subpar?\\
242 - I'm not proud of it, Amy, but I have a temper.\\
243 - Well, I suppose we could pick a different date.\\
244 - Well, it took you nine months to choose that one.\\
245 - I'll pick a different husband first.\\
246 - (knocking at door)\\
247 - Hey, I-I just, I wanted to apologize about the Athenaeum.\\
248 - Why did you lie to me?\\
249 - I don't know.\\
250 - It just seemed funny at first     and then the longer it went on, funnier it got.\\
251 - So, yeah, I guess that's why.\\
252 - That's not much of an apology.\\
253 - Yeah, because he's not really sorry.\\
254 - Obviously, he wanted a place to go where I wouldn't be     and apparently all of outside wasn't enough for him.\\
255 - Come on.\\
256 - I-I do feel bad.\\
257 - Why?\\
258 - Did your best friend hurt your feelings?\\
259 - Come on-- Sheldon.\\
260 - Look, I only have time to deal with one jerk right now     and that's Barry Kripke.\\
261 - What?\\
262 - He has the Athenaeum booked for our wedding date     and he won't give it up.\\
263 - Yeah, so if you could just please leave before I get angry     and say something I will regret about your face, your height,     your personal hygiene or the fact that your science,     while serviceable, lacks panache.\\
264 - That's actually one of the nicest things     you've ever said about my work.\\
265 - And now I regret it.\\
266 - Good-bye.\\
267 - Hey.\\
268 - There you are.\\
269 - Yeah, I just wanted to stop in and see my office     before we went to lunch.\\
270 - Just a few more weeks, you'll be back full-time, huh?\\
271 - Yeah.\\
272 - Uh-oh.\\
273 - That wasn't a happy “yeah.”     That was a “Hey, Leonard, do you want to go to the gym?” yeah.\\
274 - I've just been thinking that maybe I'd rather     stay home with the kids and be a mom.\\
275 - Wow.\\
276 - That's big.\\
277 - I know.\\
278 - Dr.\\
279 - Rostenkowski.\\
280 - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were back.\\
281 - Oh, I'm not.\\
282 - I just came to meet Penny for lunch.\\
283 - Is there anything I can get you?\\
284 - Coffee?\\
285 - Water?\\
286 - No, I think we're just gonna...\\
287 - Coffee sounds good.\\
288 - Cold brew, almond milk?\\
289 - Perfect.\\
290 - Nothing-nothing for me.\\
291 - (clears throat)\\
292 - It's weird.\\
293 - I've been away so long I don't miss any of this.\\
294 - (intercom buzzes)\\
295 - JESS: Sorry to bother you.\\
296 - Dr.\\
297 - Lee heard you were here and had a quick question.\\
298 - Fine.\\
299 - Put him on.\\
300 - Jerold, what's going on?\\
301 - Hope you're not screwing up my research.\\
302 - You calling from a bike ride?\\
303 - 'Cause you're backpedaling hard.\\
304 - All right, fine.\\
305 - E-mail it over.\\
306 - I'll take a look.\\
307 - (clears throat)\\
308 - Oh, sorry.\\
309 - Where were we?\\
310 - Love your kids.\\
311 - Don't miss your job.\\
312 - Right, right.\\
313 - There's nothing in the world     like holding your sleeping baby,     knowing you make him feel safe and then--     Oh, good, you got the little cookies I like.\\
314 - I wouldn't mind a cookie.\\
315 - And he's gone.\\
316 - Okay.\\
317 - (knock on door)\\
318 - Hey, Kripke.\\
319 - Hello, Hofstadter.\\
320 - Why are you cleaning that out yourself?\\
321 - Don't you have grad students?\\
322 - Come on, I can't make my grad students do every dirty job     or so I've been told in writing by the head of Human Resources.\\
323 - Fair enough.\\
324 - Uh, so, look,     I'm here to ask you to give Sheldon and Amy     the Athenaeum for their wedding.\\
325 - (laughs)\\
326 - Why would I do that?\\
327 - Because deep down, Barry, you're a really good guy.\\
328 - But am I?\\
329 - Fine.\\
330 - What's it gonna take?\\
331 - Barry, I've come to ask one more...\\
332 - Leonard?\\
333 - Wh-Why are you doing that?\\
334 - Because deep down Barry is not a good guy.\\
335 - He's making you clean out barrels of irradiated grease?\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - I made a deal with him     to get you the Athenaeum for your wedding.\\
338 - Why would you do that?\\
339 - (sighs)\\
340 - Because I was a jerk for lying to you before     and besides, you're my best friend.\\
341 - I want you to have the wedding of your dreams.\\
342 - On Mars?\\
343 - Okay, I want Amy to have the wedding of her dreams.\\
344 - Well, thank you.\\
345 - But I don't want you to do this.\\
346 - No, it's okay.\\
347 - No, it's not.\\
348 - We're not going to let Barry win.\\
349 - Well, what are we going to do?\\
350 - We have a combined IQ of    .\\
351 - Perhaps more if that radiation gave you a super brain.\\
352 - You know what?\\
353 - You're right.\\
354 - If we work together we could totally outsmart Barry Kripke.\\
355 - Leonard, my nose itches.\\
356 - What do I do?\\
357 - Oh, boy.\\
358 - I really passed out hard.\\
359 - Yeah, tell me about it.\\
360 - The kids could've screamed bloody murder     and you wouldn't have woken up.\\
361 - Which I know because they did.\\
362 - I'm sorry.\\
363 - Why did I think I could do this on my own?\\
364 - Hey, don't beat yourself up.\\
365 - Parenting is hard.\\
366 - Like, I've seen and smelled things today     that I cannot unsee or unsmell.\\
367 - Thanks for covering for me.\\
368 - No, I mean he only drinks milk.\\
369 - Like, where are the colors coming from?\\
370 - What time is it?\\
371 - Uh, it's almost  :  .\\
372 - Okay.\\
373 - Bernadette's gonna be home soon.\\
374 - We got to divide and conquer.\\
375 - I'll make dinner.\\
376 - You watch the kids.\\
377 - Uh, kids are asleep.\\
378 - Great, then you make dinner.\\
379 - Hey, good news, Amy.\\
380 - We got the Athenaeum.\\
381 - Oh, my gosh.\\
382 - That's amazing.\\
383 - How'd you get Barry to change his mind?\\
384 - Well, I couldn't have done it without Leonard.\\
385 - Boy, you should've seen us in there.\\
386 - We were like Batman and Robin.\\
387 - Why do I have to be Robin?\\
388 - If you have to ask, you're Robin.\\
389 - What happened?\\
390 - Well, we scrubbed out some barrels of irradiated grease,     rinsed off in a safety shower     and then told Barry Kripke what is what.\\
391 - And he just gave in?\\
392 - Well, we agreed to invite him to the wedding.\\
393 - Okay.\\
394 - No problem.\\
395 - - And he gets to bring a date.\\
396 - - Yeah.\\
397 - Well, that's reasonable.\\
398 - A-And if she charges by the hour, we have to cover it.\\
399 - What else did you agree to?\\
400 - Well, um, you know how Barry has the voice of an angel?\\
401 - He is not singing at our wedding.\\
402 - (stammers)\\
403 - He only wants to sing “Volare.”     Oh, “Volare”.\\
404 - That's what he was saying.\\
405 - Boy, I didn't, I did not get that.\\
406 - Guys, I appreciate everything you did,     but we can find another location that's just as good.\\
407 - Maybe the Japanese garden or the planetarium.\\
408 - (gasps)\\
409 - The planetarium.\\
410 - I hadn't thought about that.\\
411 - That's even better.\\
412 - LEONARD: Wait, what?\\
413 - I scrubbed sludge for you.\\
414 - (stammers)\\
415 - I may be slightly radioactive.\\
416 - Oh, you're exaggerating.\\
417 - Don't let him touch the silverware.\\
418 - Why is Raj asleep on our couch?\\
419 - Oh.\\
420 - I needed some help so he came by,     played with the kids, read them some stories,     put them down for their nap and made dinner.\\
421 - What'd you do?\\
422 - Ate dinner.\\
423 - Okay, look, I don't think I'm cut out     to be a stay-at-home dad.\\
424 - And since you want to, you should stay home.\\
425 - I-I do definitely want to,     but I know how much this means to you and it was just one day.\\
426 - So, don't give up.\\
427 - You don't want to stay home, either.\\
428 - Do you?\\
429 - When I went by the office they gave me     coffee and cookies and no one peed on me.\\
430 - I miss that so much.\\
431 - Well, I love the kids, but I also love my job.\\
432 - (laughing): And sleep.\\
433 - I know.\\
434 - I took a two-hour nap on the couch in my office.\\
435 - I took a three-hour nap on the floor in the living room.\\
436 - How do you feel now?\\
437 - Honestly?\\
438 - Still tired.\\
439 - Me, too.\\
440 - I love you.\\
441 - I love you, too.\\
442 - And we'll figure this all out.\\
443 - Yeah.\\
444 - Everyone's asleep.\\
445 - You want to head upstairs and...\\
446 - (giggles)\\
447 - ...you know.\\
448 - Let's just do it right here.\\
449 - Oh, oh, I like the way you think.
\subsection {Episode 18: The Gates Excitation}
1 - But why do they still call Batman using the Bat-Signal?\\
2 - Wouldn't it just be, like, easier to text him?\\
3 - The Bat-Signal isn't just to alert Batman,   it's also to strike fear in the hearts of his enemies   and let them know he's coming.\\
4 - Sort of like Sheldon's knock.\\
5 - Comparing me to Batman?\\
6 - I'll take it.\\
7 - If we don't do anything,   how long do you think they'll talk about Batman?\\
8 - Well, I've know them for    years, so...\\
9 - years.\\
10 - I believe they do text him.\\
11 - The-the Bat-Signal is linked to his phone via Bluetooth.\\
12 - Has that been in the comics?\\
13 - No, it's just what I believe.\\
14 - All right, I'm putting a stop to this.\\
15 - If you knew how, why'd you wait    years?\\
16 - Hey, guys, guess what?\\
17 - Today at work, I found out I am going to meet Bill Gates.\\
18 - (excited chatter)\\
19 - Sorry, Leonard, you and Penny had a good run.\\
20 - I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.\\
21 - You sure?\\
22 - I-I bet his Internet's really fast.\\
23 - How did this happen?\\
24 - Well, his foundation is looking to partner    with a pharmaceutical company to help develop affordable vaccines    so they asked me to show him around.\\
25 - That's great.\\
26 - When's he coming?\\
27 - Uh, he gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning,    I'm gonna give him a tour of the labs and offices.\\
28 - Oh.\\
29 - He gets in on Sunday, April first?\\
30 - (chuckles)\\
31 - Nice try, Penny.\\
32 - What're you talking about?\\
33 - April Fools' Day.\\
34 - This is another one of your classic pranks    you try to pull on me every year.\\
35 - Literally never pulled a prank on you.\\
36 - Oh, really?\\
37 - What about last year,    when you sent me that e-mail with the photo attached,    but you didn't attach a photo.\\
38 - That was a mistake.\\
39 - Messing with me?\\
40 - Yes, it was.\\
41 - And this year,    I am not falling for it.\\
42 - Sheldon, I swear...\\
43 - No...\\
44 - what are you doing?\\
45 - Oh, you're right.\\
46 - He's not coming.\\
47 - April fools.\\
48 - You know what they say,    fool me "N" times,    where "N" equals the amount of times you've already fooled me,    shame on you.\\
49 - Fool me "N" plus one times, shame on me.\\
50 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state \\
51 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
52 -  The Earth began to cool \\
53 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools \\
54 -  We built the Wall \\
55 -  We built the pyramids \\
56 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery \\
57 -  That all started with a big bang \\
58 -  Bang! \\
59 - So you're gonna spend a day    with Bill Gates.\\
60 - I'm a little jealous.\\
61 - Well, I'm a little nervous.\\
62 - You know, if I do a good job, I'm hoping they'll consider me    for a PR position that's opening up.\\
63 - Well, if you're nervous, I-I know a lot about him.\\
64 - I can fill you in or maybe come along, whatever.\\
65 - I think I'll be okay.\\
66 - Well, I'm-I'm just saying, what are you gonna do    when he wants to talk about high-level language interpreters    for microcomputers?\\
67 - What are high-level language interpreters for microcomputers?\\
68 - A way of programming computers    using words and commands instead of binary code.\\
69 - Oh.\\
70 - That's actually kind of interesting.\\
71 - Tell me more.\\
72 - Oh, well...\\
73 - That, I'll do that.\\
74 - Mm-hmm.\\
75 - - I didn't even see it coming.\\
76 - - Yeah, well...\\
77 - You never do.\\
78 - Well, i-it's just, he's an idol of mine    and I would love the chance to hang out with him.\\
79 - Look, I know you want to meet him,    but I can't turn this into a social thing, okay?\\
80 - This is my job.\\
81 - I really need it to go well.\\
82 - I get it, I get it.\\
83 - You're right.\\
84 - Actually, I've-I've already met him once before.\\
85 - He gave a talk at Princeton and my mom took me.\\
86 - Oh, really?\\
87 - Was he nice?\\
88 - He's super nice.\\
89 - I-I got pretty emotional and started crying and...\\
90 - He didn't make fun of me or anything.\\
91 - Well, you were a kid.\\
92 - Uh-huh.\\
93 - Bye, my babies, I love you.\\
94 - (high-pitched): We love you, too, Mommy.\\
95 - Yeah, don't do that.\\
96 - AMY: Bernadette?\\
97 - Hi.\\
98 - Where you off to?\\
99 - El parque. El parque?     I'm learning Spanish so I can talk to the other nannies.\\
100 - How's that going?\\
101 - Bueno.     Good?\\
102 - Oh...\\
103 - No bueno.     - Thanks for coming over.\\
104 - - No problem.\\
105 - Can I get you anything?\\
106 - Juice box?\\
107 - 'Naners?\\
108 - 'Naners?\\
109 - Sorry.\\
110 - Mom brain.\\
111 - I think I've forgot how to talk to grown-ups.\\
112 - I meant Ba-naners.\\
113 - You know what, I'm good.\\
114 - Okay.\\
115 - So, what are we watching?\\
116 - Bob the Builder. I'll catch you up.\\
117 - That one's Bob.\\
118 - He's a builder.\\
119 - Isn't this a kids show?\\
120 - It's what we watch in this house.\\
121 - Bob the Builder, Dinosaur Train,     and Peppa Pig, which is both funny and meaningful.\\
122 - You want to take a break and maybe get something to eat?\\
123 - Sure.\\
124 - Why does it not feel like we're going?\\
125 - Hang on, I-I just want to see if Bob can fix it.\\
126 - (chuckles)\\
127 - Yes, he can!\\
128 - Oh, hey.\\
129 - I folded your laundry for you.\\
130 - You're welcome.\\
131 - Uh, that's not mine.\\
132 - You're saying that these aren't yours?\\
133 - No.\\
134 - So you're saying that I'm touching     a stranger's underpants?\\
135 - Yes.\\
136 - And just like that, it's the worst day of my life.\\
137 - - Wait, why are you being so weird?\\
138 - - (sighs)\\
139 - It occurred to me that perhaps you were telling the truth     about Bill Gates and it wasn't just part of an elaborate prank.\\
140 - What would the prank part even be?\\
141 - I show up to meet Bill Gates over your "objections,"     but it's not Bill Gates at all, no.\\
142 - It's one of those look-alikes that you hire for a party.\\
143 - And then when I go around     showing everybody the balloon animal     that "Bill Gates" made for me, I'll look like an idiot.\\
144 - Have you been eating laundry detergent?\\
145 - I just need you to tell me the truth.\\
146 - This is driving me crazy.\\
147 - Sheldon, he is really coming.\\
148 - Is he?\\
149 - He is.\\
150 - Really?\\
151 - Yeah.\\
152 - Well, now I don't know what to believe!\\
153 - Thanks for getting me out of the house.\\
154 - I feel like my brain is turning to mush.\\
155 - Happy to help.\\
156 - Did I show you the video of the kids sitting?\\
157 - Yes, you texted it to me at  :   a.m.\\
158 - Thought someone was either in jail or dead.\\
159 - I'm sorry.\\
160 - No, no, i-it gave me something to watch     while I tried to go back to sleep.\\
161 - You know what?\\
162 - I don't want to be one of those moms     who can only talk about her kids.\\
163 - Okay, well, I'm reading a pretty good book.\\
164 - It's the untold story of female artists during the Renaissance.\\
165 - Oh, I'm in the middle of a book, too.\\
166 - It's three pages long and floats in the bath.\\
167 - All right, we can talk about something else.\\
168 - It also quacks when you squeeze it.\\
169 - You should've seen Michael laugh.\\
170 - I think I have a video.\\
171 - Or maybe we can't.\\
172 - Why is your screen name "JohnWilliams"?\\
173 - Uh, because I always score.\\
174 - Hey, I think I'm gonna head to the office for a little bit.\\
175 - On a Sunday?\\
176 - Yeah.\\
177 - Want to make sure I'm prepared for tomorrow.\\
178 - Do you think you could get Bill Gates     to sign something for me?\\
179 - Yeah, maybe, like what?\\
180 - Oh, my arm, my chest, his call.\\
181 - His call will be to the police.\\
182 - Penny, remember when I introduced you     to     calorie Dove bars     and you said you owed me, like, big-time?\\
183 - Guys, even if I wanted to introduce you,     there is no room in his schedule.\\
184 - I mean, look.\\
185 - Look at this itinerary.\\
186 - I meet him at his hotel first thing tomorrow morning,     then we're on the go all day long.\\
187 - You're right.\\
188 - Guys, this is her job.\\
189 - We need to respect that.\\
190 - Thank you, honey.\\
191 - Proud of you.\\
192 - Love you.\\
193 - (door closes)\\
194 - I totally just saw what hotel he's staying at.\\
195 - What are we waiting here for?\\
196 - For Penny to walk down the stairs,     get in her car, and drive away.\\
197 - Right, smart.\\
198 - (clears throat)\\
199 - Is that long enough?\\
200 - She's pretty quick, let's go.\\
201 - What would you do if you had a billion dollars?\\
202 - Same as Bill Gates,     try to make the world a better place,     but I'd do it in a working Iron Man suit.\\
203 - I didn't know that came in a boys' medium.\\
204 - Th-This is a bad idea.\\
205 - Maybe we should go.\\
206 - What are you talking about?\\
207 - I don't know.\\
208 - I'm just feeling guilty,     like I'm kind of sneaking around behind Penny's back.\\
209 - We're not doing anything wrong.\\
210 - We're just hanging out in a hotel lobby.\\
211 - Plenty of people do that:     businessmen, high-end prostitutes.\\
212 - That's a fun new game,     CEO or Ho.\\
213 - No, this is wrong, let's go.\\
214 - Guys, guys, that's him.\\
215 - - Be cool.\\
216 - -Oh, my God.\\
217 - Oh, my God.\\
218 - Oh, my God.\\
219 - Oh, my God.\\
220 - Cooler.\\
221 - Oh, my God.\\
222 - Oh, my God.\\
223 - Oh, my God.\\
224 - Uh, M-Mr.\\
225 - Gates, I'm-I'm Dr.\\
226 - Leonard Hofstadter.\\
227 - We've actually met before.\\
228 - Sorry, I don't remember.\\
229 - You were so nice, a-and it was really special to me     because you've been such a big influence on my life.\\
230 - I mean, ever since I was a little kid,     I've looked up to you like-like a hero.\\
231 - Oh, now I remember.\\
232 - Would you like a tissue?\\
233 - How about a hug?\\
234 - How-how about a tissue?\\
235 - Sorry I talked about my kids the whole time.\\
236 - Oh, don't worry about it.\\
237 - I mean, besides you cutting up my meat for me,     it was a lovely lunch.\\
238 - God.\\
239 - What's happening?\\
240 - I'm a smart, educated, successful...\\
241 - "Woman"?\\
242 - I was gonna get it.\\
243 - Don't be so hard on yourself.\\
244 - Pregnancy and childbirth actually cause physical changes     to the structure of your brain.\\
245 - I liked the old structure of my brain.\\
246 - But then, I liked a lot of my old structures.\\
247 - Well, these are positive changes.\\
248 - Studies with rats show that new mothers     are more sensitive to danger, better at multitasking     and bolder in the pursuit of food.\\
249 - I did stick a couple lamp chops in my purse.\\
250 - So that's what I was smelling.\\
251 - Look, even though your brain is different,     in many ways, it's better.\\
252 - But were you bored?\\
253 - Of course not.\\
254 - You're lying.\\
255 - Which you can tell, because your maternal brain is better     at sensing nonverbal cues.\\
256 - Now you're just being condescending.\\
257 - (laughs softly)\\
258 - Look at you, two for two.\\
259 - LEONARD: Uh, hold the door.\\
260 - Hold the door!\\
261 - (keys jangle)\\
262 - Oh.\\
263 - Hi, Leonard.\\
264 - Didn't you hear me yell "hold the door"?\\
265 - I did.\\
266 - But you know what they say,     "hold the door, get robbed some more."     No one says that.\\
267 - Oh.\\
268 - Well, they should,     because it's true, and it rhymes.\\
269 - So where have you been?\\
270 - Actually, I met Bill Gates.\\
271 - (sighs)\\
272 - I see.\\
273 - You're all in on it.\\
274 - Uh, nice try.\\
275 - It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon.\\
276 - I actually went to a hotel and met him.\\
277 - Right, right.\\
278 - Okay, so, uh,     "Bill Gates" was at the "hotel" that you "went to."     Why is "went to" in quotes?\\
279 - Fine.\\
280 - So "Bill Gates" was at the "hotel"     that you went to.\\
281 - That's you and Bill Gates.\\
282 - It is.\\
283 - Were you crying?\\
284 - No.\\
285 - So,     it wasn't a joke, and I actually could've met him?\\
286 - Well, he's probably still there.\\
287 - (gasps)\\
288 - What hotel?\\
289 - The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks,     under the name Hernandez.\\
290 - Thank you, thank you so much!\\
291 - April fools.\\
292 - Hey.\\
293 - Hey, where you been?\\
294 - Uh, just hanging out with the guys.\\
295 - They still mad at me?\\
296 - Uh, they were, but then I was like, "Hey,"     and they were like, "What?" and I was like, "You know,"     and they were like, "Okay."     You're a good husband.\\
297 - Well, it's not for me to say, but you just said it,     so you're probably right.\\
298 - Well, as it turns out, there is     a little reception for Mr.\\
299 - Gates tomorrow night.\\
300 - I asked if I could bring you, and they said yes.\\
301 - What?\\
302 - Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.\\
303 - Wait, what do you mean "again"?\\
304 - 'Cause you met him that one time with your mom.\\
305 - Yes.\\
306 - And then again tomorrow,     for a total of two, and only two times.\\
307 - Yeah.\\
308 - I wonder if he'll remember you.\\
309 - Yeah, I wonder that, too.\\
310 - BERNADETTE (over baby monitor): The sun is losing about     six times ten to the   th grams per second,     so the fraction of the mass it loses every year     is about ten to the negative   th.\\
311 - But don't worry.\\
312 - It'll be millions of years before we all freeze to death.\\
313 - Sweet dreams.\\
314 - Wow.\\
315 - Hop on Pop took a dark turn there at the end.\\
316 - Amy made me realize that new mothers are cognitively primed     to take in new information, and I've been wasting it     making up songs about our babies' toes.\\
317 - To be fair, I cowrote "Pinky Toe, Pinky Toe."     Evolution gave me this mom brain to focus on the baby,     but I figure I can hack it to learn all kinds of new things.\\
318 - Well, that's great.\\
319 - Yeah.\\
320 - There was a problem, and I fixed it.\\
321 - Like Bob the Builder in that giraffe cage.\\
322 - Spoiler alert.\\
323 - I didn't see that one yet.\\
324 - So that's fun.\\
325 - You get to meet Bill Gates again.\\
326 - It's not fun, I'm screwed.\\
327 - It's fun for us.\\
328 - (chuckles)\\
329 - Maybe he won't remember you.\\
330 - (sighs)\\
331 - I snotted on his tie.\\
332 - Yeah, you did, like, a lot.\\
333 - Hello, Leonard.\\
334 - Thought I'd find you here.\\
335 - You snake.\\
336 - What's going on?\\
337 - He sent me all the way to Thousand Oaks     to meet Bill Gates     when he knew full well he wasn't staying there.\\
338 - Wha-- Leonard, that's terrible.\\
339 - Yeah, why would you do that?\\
340 - You know he's staying at the DoubleTree in Long Beach.\\
341 - Aha!\\
342 - Wait.\\
343 - How do I know you're not tricking me?\\
344 - We probably are.\\
345 - But what if we're not?\\
346 - You think you're so smart.\\
347 - You think I'm going to fall for it again, don't you?\\
348 - Well, I won't.\\
349 - Where you going?\\
350 - Shut up.\\
351 - Aw, are you sure you can't come?\\
352 - I want to, but I'm just too sick.\\
353 - Aw.\\
354 - And you really wanted to meet him.\\
355 - I know.\\
356 - And I've been trying to hide it so I could go,     but I don't want to make him sick.\\
357 - Yeah.\\
358 - Yeah, you do look pretty pale and clammy.\\
359 - Yeah.\\
360 - Have fun.\\
361 - Well, feel better, okay?\\
362 - No, that's just my regular pale and clammy.\\
363 - I mean, really, the bigger danger isn't the loss of mass.\\
364 - Instead, it will run out of hydrogen     to use for nuclear fuel,     swell up into a red giant, and fry the Earth.\\
365 - So you don't want to split a salad?\\
366 - No, thank you.\\
367 - But speaking of splitting things,     did you hear about the light-splitting greenhouse film     that could improve photosynthetic efficiency?\\
368 - No.\\
369 - Just a little something I read     while nursing a human being that I made.\\
370 - I'm just gonna get the chicken.\\
371 - Ah.\\
372 - N-E-K-C-I-H-C: chicken backwards.\\
373 - Boom, mom brain.\\
374 - And a whole bottle of wine.\\
375 - Whoa.\\
376 - Oh, oh, oh, oh!\\
377 - (laughs)\\
378 - In your face!\\
379 - (Skype chiming)\\
380 - (weakly): Hello?\\
381 - Aw, hey, sweetie, how you feeling?\\
382 - (moans)\\
383 - Okay.\\
384 - I'm just resting.\\
385 - Well, I have a surprise that might make you feel better.\\
386 - Oh, really?\\
387 - Yeah, look who's here.\\
388 - Wait, I know you.\\
389 - No, you don't.\\
390 - Yes, I do.\\
391 - You were waiting for me at my hotel.\\
392 - You ruined my tie.\\
393 - Wait, what?\\
394 - What's he talking about?\\
395 - Uh, he, uh-- obviously, he's kidding.\\
396 - That's a, that's a good one, Bill.\\
397 - I got to go.\\
398 - Stupid Leonard,     meeting stupid Bill Gates,     without stupid me.\\
399 - Aw.\\
400 - I am so sorry-- Sheldon?\\
401 - Oh, Leonard, I can't stay mad at you.\\
402 - Come here.\\
403 - (laughs)\\
404 - Apology accepted.\\
405 - What's for dinner?\\
406 - I'm starving.\\
407 - Hola.\\
408 - How are you ladies doing?\\
409 - Raise your hands if you're bueno.     (Letty laughs)\\
410 - Me llamo Stuart Bloom.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Tenant Disassociation}
1 - Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?\\
2 - Halley bit me.\\
3 - (laughs)\\
4 - You got beaten up by a girl.\\
5 - Hey, that's sexist.\\
6 - You're right.\\
7 - (laughs)\\
8 - You got beaten up by a baby. \\
9 - - Hi.\\
10 - - Hey.\\
11 - - Hey.\\
12 - - What you got there?\\
13 - - Oh, I grabbed a sandwich     at the food truck out front.\\
14 - Wait, n-now, hold on.\\
15 - Tonight is Friday,      and I believe you know what that means.\\
16 - That my fun, young life took a drastic turn somewhere?\\
17 - No.\\
18 - But yeah.\\
19 - No, that means it's Chinese food night.\\
20 - Yeah, and you have Chinese food.\\
21 - So eat it.\\
22 - But I can smell your pastrami.\\
23 - And we can all hear your complaining,      so no one's happy.\\
24 - It does smell good.\\
25 - Oh, it is.\\
26 - I had one the other day.\\
27 - (stammers)\\
28 - What is happening?\\
29 - Everybody's supposed to be eating Chinese food.\\
30 - Well, actually, I believe the Chinese      may have invented the sandwich.\\
31 - Their dish “rou jia mo” literally means      “meat between bread.”      So, it looks like all of us, including Penny,      are eating Chinese food.\\
32 - Except for you, Sheldon.\\
33 - You're eating crow.\\
34 - I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting      that the sandwich was invented      by John Montagu, the Earl of Sandwich.\\
35 - Oh.\\
36 - The truck's called “Pearl of Sandwich.”      Now I get it.\\
37 - All right, that smells too good.\\
38 - I got to get one of those.\\
39 - And I think you're forgetting that there are written documents      of meat between bread being eaten in China      during the Tang dynasty.\\
40 - You know what, I'll go with you.\\
41 - And then maybe we just go home.\\
42 - I think you're defining bread very loosely.\\
43 - If we go down that road, where does it end?\\
44 - Well, I would say when we go to bed,      but you talk in your sleep.\\
45 - I don't want to get into this with you right now.\\
46 - We'll talk about this when I'm asleep.\\
47 - I don't want to talk about it when you're asleep.\\
48 - How come we can't talk about it now?\\
49 - Well, because I'm eating now.\\
50 - Fine.\\
51 - How's your moo shu?\\
52 - You know what?\\
53 - It's great.\\
54 - Wait, look at that.\\
55 - Hmm.\\
56 - Well, maybe the Chinese did invent the sandwich.\\
57 - I guess you were right.\\
58 - Too bad no one's around to hear it.\\
59 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
60 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
61 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
62 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
63 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids    \\
64 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
65 -  That all started with a big bang      \\
66 -  Bang!      \\
67 - I can smell that food truck from up here.\\
68 - Just close the window if you don't like the smell.\\
69 - Of course I like the smell.\\
70 - It's salt and fat.\\
71 - My brain may be evolved, but my tongue still wants      to pick up a club and drag that truck back to my cave.\\
72 - So, there's something you like,      but it's also driving you crazy.\\
73 - Been there, doing it now.\\
74 - No, it-it's a distraction.\\
75 - How can I focus on my work      when all I can think about is how much I want that sandwich?\\
76 - So, go get one.\\
77 - I can't just give in to every urge I have      when I have it.\\
78 - That's why I have a rigid schedule.\\
79 - It's bad enough I had to give in to my urge      to create a rigid schedule.\\
80 - You know, why don't I just go down to the food truck      and ask them to move?\\
81 - - Why are you taking cash?\\
82 - - No reason.\\
83 - Oh, this is the life.\\
84 - What could be better than this?\\
85 - If you weren't wearing one of my swimsuits.\\
86 - I'll give it back.\\
87 - (chuckles)\\
88 - You know the rule--      once it touches hiney, it's no longer miney.\\
89 - You're such a prude.\\
90 - Do you know all the things this water's touching right now?\\
91 - Well, I'm relaxed enough.\\
92 - Hey, Howard, look.\\
93 - What's that?\\
94 - Huh.\\
95 - Looks like someone's drone.\\
96 - Oh, no.\\
97 - Do you think it was spying on us in the hot tub?\\
98 - 'Cause I'm only   % of the way to my beach bod.\\
99 - One of the propellers is broken.\\
100 - It must have crashed.\\
101 - Oh.\\
102 - Do you think you could fix it?\\
103 - Maybe.\\
104 - Should we try and track down the owner first?\\
105 - Yeah, that's probably a good idea.\\
106 - Anyone lose a drone?\\
107 - Looks like it's ours.\\
108 - - Yay, we got a drone!\\
109 - - Shh.\\
110 - (whispers): Oh.\\
111 - Yay, we got a drone.\\
112 - (sighs)\\
113 - The pastrami truck moved.\\
114 - That is the danger of a restaurant on wheels.\\
115 - No, apparently someone complained       to the tenants association,       and they're not allowed to park on our street anymore.\\
116 - Who would complain about something that everyone loves?\\
117 - Oh...\\
118 - Did you complain to the tenants association       about the food truck?\\
119 - Yes.\\
120 - And they actually took you seriously?\\
121 - Oh, the tenants association takes every complaint seriously.\\
122 - Oh, great, because I'm about to send them an e-mail       complaining about you.\\
123 - (phone chimes)\\
124 - Excuse me.\\
125 - Wow.\\
126 - Someone should have spell-checked.\\
127 - What is going on here?\\
128 - You're the tenants association?\\
129 - (laughs): You should see the look on your face.\\
130 - You might want to tell your wife       that there's no “Y” in “pastrami.”       Okay, that ought to do it.\\
131 - I've replaced the propeller       and reattached the gimbal controller unit.\\
132 - Dude, you're like Grey's Anatomy for robots.\\
133 - Also, why isn't that a show?\\
134 - I just need to see if I can re-sync       the controls to this old remote.\\
135 - We should name it.\\
136 - The drone, or your stupid robot show?\\
137 - The drone.\\
138 - The show's already got a name--       General Bot-spital.       I got it working!\\
139 - (chuckles)\\
140 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, oh!\\
141 - Let's play William Tell.\\
142 - I'll put this bowl on my head.\\
143 - See if you can knock it off without hitting me.\\
144 - You read my mind.\\
145 - What are you doing?\\
146 - Either breaking a bowl or breaking Raj's head.\\
147 - Be careful, they don't make that bowl anymore.\\
148 - (chuckles)\\
149 - It's a nice one.\\
150 - Yeah.\\
151 - We found it in the yard and fixed it up.\\
152 - Aren't you worried there's some kid out there       missing his drone?\\
153 - Oh, please, Bernadette,       this is not a children's toy, okay?\\
154 - This thing's got an HD camera on it.\\
155 - Okay, then aren't you worried there's some rich       Peeping Tom out there missing his drone?\\
156 - We asked around, and no one claimed it.\\
157 - Ha.\\
158 - I think we've done all we can do.\\
159 - Did you check the video card?\\
160 - Maybe you can see where it started off from.\\
161 - What a great idea, honey.\\
162 - So, let me get this straight.\\
163 - You are the president of the tenants association?\\
164 - President, only member, and harshest critic.\\
165 - I once gave myself an official reprimand       for conducting a meeting in the shower.\\
166 - The steam warped my gavel.\\
167 - Okay, so when I got a fine for leaving my clothes       in the dryer for too long, that was from you?\\
168 - $  .  .\\
169 - The exact price of a new gavel.\\
170 - And the noise complaint we got       for singing you “Happy Birthday”?\\
171 - As a friend, I was touched.\\
172 - As a representative of the building,       I thought that you should pick a key and stick with it.\\
173 - Hi.\\
174 - Do you know he is the entire tenants association?\\
175 - No, but I'm not surprised.\\
176 - He's also the pope of a planet he invented in hyperspace.\\
177 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
178 - 'Cause I wanted to make sure that you loved the man,       not the office.\\
179 - You can't just declare yourself president.\\
180 - I didn't.\\
181 - I called a meeting,       I was the only one to attend.\\
182 - I nominated myself, and after a pretty moving speech,       I voted myself in.\\
183 - Well, if you can vote yourself in,       - then we can vote you out.\\
184 - - Yeah.\\
185 - Fine.\\
186 - Make a motion at the next meeting.\\
187 - When is that?\\
188 - It's the first Saturday of every month.\\
189 - Unless there's an emergency meeting.\\
190 - Then we call an emergency meeting.\\
191 - You really don't have to.\\
192 - This is the first Saturday of the month.\\
193 - Okay, fine.\\
194 - Then we vote you out.\\
195 - Uh, uh, hold on.\\
196 - Hold on.\\
197 - First,       we have to read the minutes from last month's meeting.\\
198 - Amy, would you do the honors?\\
199 - Why not?\\
200 - “Saturday, March  rd.\\
201 - “ :  , meeting called to order.\\
202 - “ :  , president gets shampoo in eye.\\
203 - :  , meeting adjourned.”       Okay, can we vote you out now?\\
204 - Ah, very well.\\
205 - New business.\\
206 - I move for a vote of no confidence       - in the president.\\
207 - - Yeah.\\
208 - Two to one, you lose.\\
209 - Not so fast.\\
210 - I believe we have one tenant here       who has not made her voice heard.\\
211 - Oh...\\
212 - We're waiting, fiancée.\\
213 - Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.\\
214 - Yeah, we're waiting,       neighbor who needed a battery       and totally got one from me, no strings attached.\\
215 - I don't want to be in the middle of this.\\
216 - No matter which way I vote, I'm either       a bad friend, a bad fiancée,       or an ungrateful recipient of a battery.\\
217 - Next time I have a meeting in the shower,       you're welcome to attend.\\
218 - Sheldon.\\
219 - Sheldon for president.\\
220 - I pick Sheldon!\\
221 - Ugh, I can't believe my best friend sided with Sheldon.\\
222 - Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.\\
223 - Ah, I should've taken that gavel       and shoved it right down  his throat.\\
224 - - Ugh.\\
225 - I would've gone the other way,       but it would've gotten to his throat.\\
226 - What?\\
227 - Don't be mad at me.\\
228 - I mean, I can't vote against him.\\
229 - Even when he's being crazy?\\
230 - Well, what other times are there?!\\
231 - So you just let him get away with anything?\\
232 - Well, not anything.\\
233 - But honestly, pastrami sandwich       is not the hill I want to die on.\\
234 - It's not about the sandwich.\\
235 - It's about the principle.\\
236 - Yeah, principle.\\
237 - - And a little bit sandwich.\\
238 - - Yeah.\\
239 - Look, there are a bunch of other tenants in this building.\\
240 - All you need is for one of them to vote your way,       and then Sheldon's out and I didn't betray him.\\
241 - Hey, you know, that's actually a good plan.\\
242 - That you came up with all by yourself.\\
243 - Now, if you'll excuse me,       told Sheldon I was going to the market,       so...\\
244 - I'm taking some of your stuff.\\
245 - I was never here.\\
246 - Sometimes you don't see it 'cause she's next to Sheldon,       but she's pretty weird.\\
247 - Okay.\\
248 - All hooked up.\\
249 - Here we go.\\
250 - I hope there's nothing disturbing on there.\\
251 - Like you two in a hot tub?\\
252 - Hold on.\\
253 - Now I'm getting a picture.\\
254 - That's not very much to go on.\\
255 - Oh, that's plenty to go on.\\
256 - We can't give up.\\
257 - We got to find her.\\
258 - You just want to find her 'cause she's cute.\\
259 - Not just because she's cute.\\
260 - She also owns a pretty expensive drone,       which means she has money and doesn't mind wasting it.\\
261 - And I...\\
262 - I like that in a woman.\\
263 - Do you see anything that could help us locate her?\\
264 - Hmm, let me have a look.\\
265 - She's got eagle eyes,       always spotting continuity errors in movies.\\
266 - (chuckles)\\
267 - It's not annoying at all.\\
268 - Oh.\\
269 - There.\\
270 - Right there.\\
271 - Check out the pin on her jacket.\\
272 - Isn't that from the comic book store?\\
273 - Hmm, is it?\\
274 - - Hey, Howard, zoom in.\\
275 - - Oh.\\
276 - Fine.\\
277 - Zooming in.\\
278 - (whooshes)\\
279 - Yeah, I know you're being a jerk,       but it's actually helpful.\\
280 - Hi.\\
281 - Hi.\\
282 - We're your neighbors from downstairs.\\
283 - We've met.\\
284 - Remember?\\
285 - I invited you to my housewarming when I moved in.\\
286 - Oh, yeah.\\
287 - Sorry.\\
288 - You know, it's been a crazy couple months.\\
289 - That was two years ago.\\
290 - - Welcome to the building.\\
291 - - Mm-hmm.\\
292 - So, I-I'm running for president of the tenants association.\\
293 - I could really use your vote.\\
294 - You said you were gonna stop by.\\
295 - I bought a lot of food.\\
296 - Anyway, meeting's tomorrow.\\
297 - We really hope you can make it.\\
298 - - I'll be there.\\
299 - - Oh, really?\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - You should buy a lot of food.\\
302 - So, I'm running for president of the tenants association       and I could really use your vote.\\
303 - Uh, who's president now?\\
304 - Uh, Sheldon Cooper.\\
305 - You know, about yay tall       and about yay annoying.\\
306 - So you want me to vote against Sheldon Cooper?\\
307 - Yeah.\\
308 - You just need to show up at a meeting...\\
309 - Oh, no, no.\\
310 - No can do.\\
311 - He's got a restraining order against me.\\
312 - Really?\\
313 - Why?\\
314 - Uh, I locked him on the roof once.\\
315 - (whispers): Three times.\\
316 - So, Mrs.\\
317 - Petrescu,       we were hoping you would vote for Leonard       instead of voting for Sheldon.\\
318 - Vote Sheldon.\\
319 - No, no.\\
320 - Vote Leonard.\\
321 - No vote Leonard.\\
322 - No.\\
323 - Vote Leonard.\\
324 - Thank you.\\
325 - She's wearing a pin from your store.\\
326 - Do you know who she is?\\
327 - Oh, sure, yeah.\\
328 - That's Cynthia.\\
329 - Wha...\\
330 - s-so, she's a customer?\\
331 - Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't seen her in a while.\\
332 - And before you say anything,       there is a lot of reasons women stop coming here.\\
333 - It's not just me.\\
334 - But this time...\\
335 - It was me.\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - I was trying out a flirty new smile.\\
338 - Now, I don't use the word       “ghoulish” a lot, but...\\
339 - I-I just can't think of another word.\\
340 - Wait, do you know how to find her?\\
341 - Yeah.\\
342 - I think I have her address on my mailing list.\\
343 - Oh.\\
344 - Hey.\\
345 - Please, let me bring the drone back to her.\\
346 - You think you've got a shot?\\
347 - - What if she's married?\\
348 - - She's not.\\
349 - It's meant to be.\\
350 - A little tip.\\
351 - Uh, stick with the smiles you know.\\
352 - Hi.\\
353 - What are you doing?\\
354 - Leonard and Penny are trying to turn the tenants against me,       so they are about to see just what kind of power       the president of the tenants association wields.\\
355 - “You must be at least this tall to use washing machine”?\\
356 - I'm gonna hang it up higher than Leonard.\\
357 - And then his clothes will smell.\\
358 - And nobody's voting for a man with smelly clothes.\\
359 - No, not when there's a perfectly unscented       incumbent on the ballot.\\
360 - Sheldon, I have an advanced degree       in the study of the human brain,       so if my fiancé is a raving lunatic,       it's kind of a ding on my reputation.\\
361 - If leaders just stepped aside       every time they didn't have the consent of the governed,       what would we have?\\
362 - Democracy.\\
363 - Not on my watch.\\
364 - Okay.\\
365 - Don't be weird.\\
366 - Don't be weird.\\
367 - Don't be weird.\\
368 - (deep voice): Hello.\\
369 - Hey.\\
370 - You found my drone.\\
371 - (normal voice): Yeah, yeah.\\
372 - Yes.\\
373 - It took a while to track you down,       but to see the look on your face, it was worth it.\\
374 - Aw, that's sweet.\\
375 - Rajesh.\\
376 - - Cynthia.\\
377 - - Ah, pleasure to meet you.\\
378 - Likewise.\\
379 - I-I feel like I should give you a reward or something.\\
380 - Oh, oh, no, you don't have to do that.\\
381 - No, I insist.\\
382 - How about your phone number?\\
383 - Give me your phone.\\
384 - Thanks.\\
385 - So, I'll-I'll call you, Cynthia.\\
386 - Great, Rajesh.\\
387 - (both chuckle)\\
388 - And thanks again.\\
389 - Uh, sure.\\
390 - (phone rings)\\
391 - Just checking.\\
392 - (knocking, door opens)\\
393 - Hey, Sheldon.\\
394 - We found something pretty interesting.\\
395 - Huh.\\
396 - Well, that is surprising.\\
397 - I, for one, have no idea what they're talking about.\\
398 - Turns out, when Amy took over Penny's apartment,       she was put on the lease, not you.\\
399 - PENNY: Yeah, and when I moved across the hall,       you got taken off the lease and I got added.\\
400 - Well, what are you saying?\\
401 - That Sheldon's not technically a tenant at all       and therefore, has no standing to be president       of the tenants association no matter who votes for him?\\
402 - I don't know how you found that out,       but I am guessing all on your own.\\
403 - So, looks like we need to figure out       who the new president should be.\\
404 - I nominate myself.\\
405 - I second it.\\
406 - Huh.\\
407 - Well, as a woman in love, I want to stand by my man.\\
408 - Too bad that's been rendered bureaucratically impossible.\\
409 - Well, this is hard for me       because I do love a legal technicality       and this is a good one.\\
410 - Although, not quite as good as the provision in California law,       which states a person who occupies a dwelling       for    consecutive days becomes a tenant at will and as such...\\
411 - - I vote for Leonard!\\
412 - - You...\\
413 - What?\\
414 - I'm sorry, Sheldon.\\
415 - With minimal power comes minimal responsibility,       and you couldn't handle it.\\
416 - Don't you misquote Spider-Man to me.\\
417 - It's not your fault.\\
418 - I mean, what man wouldn't be seduced       by the power to decide how late the laundry room stays open?\\
419 - Wait, you're the reason I had to come back       and get my jeans the next morning?\\
420 - I can't believe you expect me to give that up.\\
421 - Sheldon, it's the American way,       the peaceful transfer of power.\\
422 - I don't know.\\
423 - Think about Ant-Man.       I'm always thinking about Ant-Man.       Michael Douglas had the suit       and then he passed it on to Paul Rudd.\\
424 - Maybe you're right.\\
425 - Really?\\
426 - The Ant-Man thing?\\
427 - That's what won you over?\\
428 - Yes.\\
429 - He got the details right.\\
430 - That's how you use a superhero.\\
431 - Mm.\\
432 - I suppose it is time I passed this on to Leonard.\\
433 - - Thank you.\\
434 - - Yeah, thanks.\\
435 - I-I know that's hard for you.\\
436 - Well, it was.\\
437 - But you know what?\\
438 - Instead of being in charge,       I can now be the vocal opposition,       criticizing and badgering the president at every turn.\\
439 - I think you'll be really good at that.\\
440 - Me, too.\\
441 - I think I've made a huge mistake.\\
442 - Me, too.\\
443 - Can't believe you got her number.\\
444 - I know, right?\\
445 - How amazing would it be if this worked out       and the story of how I met my wife       started with you and me in the hot tub together.\\
446 - Well, do us both a favor and start the story later.\\
447 - Whatever.\\
448 - I have a good feeling about this girl.\\
449 - Like, we really hit it off.\\
450 - Stop flying it around.\\
451 - You're gonna break it.\\
452 - Why do you care?\\
453 - Because we have to give it back to the beautiful mystery girl.\\
454 - Aw.\\
455 - I mean, did you see how hot she was?\\
456 - I want to get all up on that and start making babies!\\
457 - I know exactly what underwear       I'm gonna wear on our first date.\\
458 - None!

1 - KOOTHRAPPALI: If Bruce Banner's driving a rental car   and turns into the Hulk, do you think he's covered,   or does he need to add the Hulk as an additional driver?\\
2 - You really need a girlfriend.\\
3 - (gasps)\\
4 - Mailman's here!\\
5 - Aw.\\
6 - Remember when he used to get that excited to see us?\\
7 - Do you have any mail for Dr.\\
8 - Sheldon Cooper?\\
9 - I do, but I can't hand it right to you--   I have to put it in the box.\\
10 - And that is what separates the U.S.\\
11 - Postal Service    from those hippies at FedEx.\\
12 - Oh, goody!\\
13 - What is so exciting?\\
14 - It's a letter from Dr. Wolcott.\\
15 - We've been corresponding about my string theory research.\\
16 - Wait.\\
17 - Robert Wolcott?\\
18 - Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?\\
19 - The very same.\\
20 - Didn't he go crazy    and cut off all contact with people?\\
21 - Yeah, he was driven mad by a friend    who kept wanting to talk about the Hulk's car insurance!\\
22 - Oh.\\
23 - He's invited me to his cabin for the weekend,    to discuss a breakthrough he's had.\\
24 - - His cabin?\\
25 - - Yes.\\
26 - He lives off the grid,    up in the mountains.\\
27 - So you're gonna go to the middle of nowhere    and spend the weekend with a crazy man you've never met?\\
28 - Yes.\\
29 - Why?\\
30 - No reason.\\
31 - Have fun.\\
32 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
33 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  \\
34 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
35 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
36 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids  \\
37 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
38 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
39 -  Bang!   \\
40 - Hmm.\\
41 - Oh.\\
42 - (sniffs)\\
43 - Hmm.\\
44 - (chuckles): Oh, nice one.\\
45 - Hey, Penny, that's what you sound like when you read.\\
46 - (giggles)\\
47 - - Hey!\\
48 - - What?\\
49 - He said it.\\
50 - Sheldon, what are you doing?\\
51 - I am decoding Dr.\\
52 - Wolcott's letter    using this book as the key.\\
53 - Aren't conversations more fun when they're in code?\\
54 - Yes.\\
55 - But I'm using a code where "yes" means "no."    Oh.\\
56 - I got it!\\
57 - He's given me directions to his cabin.\\
58 - He seems a little paranoid.\\
59 - He is not paranoid.\\
60 - - What are you doing?\\
61 - - Following his instructions.\\
62 - Leonard, you are not letting Sheldon go alone this weekend.\\
63 - I am a grown man-- I don't need somebody to chaperone me.\\
64 - I just need him to drop me off, pick me up,    and pack me a sack lunch.\\
65 - Don't look at me.\\
66 - When the music stopped, you were holding Sheldon.\\
67 - Amy can't take him-- it's her bachelorette party this weekend.\\
68 - Yes, it is--    because I'm getting married!\\
69 - Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?\\
70 - Yes.\\
71 - Do you know why?\\
72 - Because you're getting married!\\
73 - (whooping)\\
74 - All right, Leonard,    looks like you're driving me.\\
75 - But maybe you could drop me at the bottom of the mountain.\\
76 - I want him to think I'm cool.\\
77 - That's great, everyone's got weekend plans.\\
78 - Amy has her bachelorette party,    and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods and get hunted for sport.\\
79 - Yeah, as someone who has to track him every time    he gets lost in IKEA, I feel like I'd be really good at that.\\
80 - Leonard, you cannot drop him off.\\
81 - You have to stay with him and keep him safe.\\
82 - Howard, you have to go and keep Leonard safe.\\
83 - Fine.\\
84 - I get it-- and you want me to go and keep Howard safe.\\
85 - - Actually, I...\\
86 - - Uh, just say yes, or he's gonna want    to come to the bachelorette party.\\
87 - Are you sure you're gonna be okay this weekend?\\
88 - Of course.\\
89 - No, I'm much more concerned about you.\\
90 - I know how you gals behave when the men are away.\\
91 - You do?\\
92 - I've read The Bacchae by Euripides.\\
93 - Drinking wine, riding panthers...\\
94 - Proof that girls have gone wild for over  ,    years.\\
95 - Well, I wish I could say none of that is gonna happen,    but Penny is planning it, and she is the reason    I own those underwear with writing across the butt.\\
96 - Well, just be careful,     and use protection.\\
97 - What do you think is gonna happen?\\
98 - I don't know.\\
99 - But it's going to be sunny,     and you burn easily.\\
100 - It'll be fine.\\
101 - I'm sure there'll be some drinking and some dancing,     and then a mailman'll probably show up     and take his clothes off...\\
102 - Nicholas is going to take his clothes off?\\
103 - No, not our mailman.\\
104 - A dancer pretending to be a mailman.\\
105 - Impersonating a federal employee?\\
106 - Oh, where's the after-party, prison?\\
107 - It's sweet that you're worried about me.\\
108 - Well, of course I'm worried about you--     I want you to be safe.\\
109 - And I want you to be safe.\\
110 - I will be.\\
111 - I'll have my friends with me.\\
112 - If anything should go wrong, I can use them as human shields.\\
113 - MAN (over speaker): For most of human history,     time was believed to be an objective part of reality.\\
114 - But with the contributions of Immanuel Kant,     science and philosophy...\\
115 - (turns down volume)\\
116 - When I said you should make a playlist for the road trip,     I meant music.\\
117 - This is better than music--     this is a lecture on nonlinear time.\\
118 - Sounds like it's just on regular time.\\
119 - Yes.\\
120 - But I put it on shuffle.\\
121 - This is nice.\\
122 - The four of us haven't taken a trip like this     since Leonard's bachelor party.\\
123 - And now here we are for Sheldon's.\\
124 - Yeah, uh, Leonard...\\
125 - As Sheldon's best man, I need to inform you     that this is not a bachelor party.\\
126 - And tell them why.\\
127 - Because you're     a tiresome scold.\\
128 - No.\\
129 - It's because a bachelor party     is typically a hedonistic blowout     where no pleasures of the flesh are denied.\\
130 - I'm not interested in that.\\
131 - How is that not exactly what I said?\\
132 - Okay, now, I promised Sheldon     things weren't gonna get too crazy tonight.\\
133 - Should I be worried?\\
134 - Oh, just about who you're marrying.\\
135 - Just come on.\\
136 - Welcome to your...\\
137 - bachelorette party!\\
138 - Oh...\\
139 - It's a quilting bee!\\
140 - My bachelorette party's a quilting bee!\\
141 - (forced chuckle)\\
142 - Isn't it perfect?\\
143 - Yeah, instead of oiled-up strippers and s*x toys,     we thought: what does Amy like?\\
144 - Amy likes the quilting bee!\\
145 - Well, this place is creepy.\\
146 - Why?\\
147 - Well, did you see his vegetable garden?\\
148 - Heirloom tomatoes in April.\\
149 - Creepy.\\
150 - Okay, listen.\\
151 - Dr.\\
152 - Wolcott is a brilliant topologist.\\
153 - We need to set some ground rules so that you don't embarrass me.\\
154 - No magic.\\
155 - No whining.\\
156 - You-- just no.\\
157 - (whiny): Hey...\\
158 - Uh, how come he gets to whine?\\
159 - Dr.\\
160 - Wolcott?\\
161 - Dr.\\
162 - Wolcott?\\
163 - Dr.\\
164 - Wolcott?\\
165 - (locks clacking)\\
166 - (locks continue clacking)\\
167 - That's a lot of locks.\\
168 - Mm.\\
169 - That was a lot of knocks-- they were made for each other.\\
170 - - Dr.\\
171 - Wolcott.\\
172 - -Dr.\\
173 - Cooper.\\
174 - Uh, who are these people?\\
175 - Oh, these are my friends.\\
176 - I wrote about them in my letter.\\
177 - Oh, letter?\\
178 - I didn't get a letter.\\
179 - Well, that's because I just sent it this morning, you know?\\
180 - So score one for linear time.\\
181 - (laughs)\\
182 - Well, um, I don't normally allow strangers into my house.\\
183 - But when you do, you-you let them out, right?\\
184 - Dr.\\
185 - Cooper, if you can promise me     these men share your intellect     and academic rigor, yeah, I suppose they can join us.\\
186 - You guys might need to wait in the car.\\
187 - Well, let me show you around.\\
188 - This is the chair where I do most of my thinking,     my thinking about work.\\
189 - Now, my thinking about people who have wronged me,     I do over there.\\
190 - I've always said that I should get a grudge chair.\\
191 - Leonard, have I not always said that?\\
192 - Mm, you have--     but you were worried you'd spend too much time in it.\\
193 - Yeah.\\
194 - That was a real concern.\\
195 - Oh, my God, this tomato is amazing!\\
196 - I can eat it like an apple.\\
197 - My secret is I fertilize it with my own manure.\\
198 - The look on your face.\\
199 - (chuckles)\\
200 - It's a sort of grin.\\
201 - You want to know what kind?\\
202 - So, Dr.\\
203 - Wolcott,     in your letter, you said you had a new mathematical approach     that would help me conceptualize the dimensions in string theory?\\
204 - Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes.\\
205 - But before we get started,     I am going to need to collect everybody's phone.\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - - Oh.\\
208 - - Why?\\
209 - Because they're little listening devices, aren't they?\\
210 - Yes, for people to spy on you and steal your work.\\
211 - Yeah, what happened to the good old days     where if someone wanted to steal your work,     they had to hire a prostitute to seduce you?\\
212 - Who told you about that?\\
213 - Just making a joke.\\
214 - Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.\\
215 - All right, now,     you're probably going to want to start with this notebook here.\\
216 - - Oh.\\
217 - Oh, my.\\
218 - - Here we are.\\
219 - (laughs): Oh...\\
220 - Um...\\
221 - no offense, Dr. Wolcott, but I'm not sure this makes any sense.\\
222 - That's because I've written it all backwards.\\
223 - You...\\
224 - Wow.\\
225 - That's "wow" backwards.\\
226 - Hmm.\\
227 - You know...\\
228 - I still don't get it.\\
229 - Well, plus the numbers are letters     and the letters are numbers.\\
230 - Oh.\\
231 - I love him.\\
232 - (whirring)\\
233 - (chuckles)\\
234 - Are you having fun?\\
235 - Yeah.\\
236 - I just, uh, finished sewing this top to bottom.\\
237 - Now I'm gonna sew it side to side.\\
238 - Pace yourself.\\
239 - (both chuckle)\\
240 - Some more tea?\\
241 - Oh, lovely.\\
242 - Oh.\\
243 - (both giggle)\\
244 - Seriously?\\
245 - What the hell?\\
246 - - Huh?\\
247 - - What?\\
248 - This is my bachelorette party,     tea and quilts?\\
249 - Well, you said     you didn't want anything crazy.\\
250 - - Yes,     but I said it like, "I don't want anything crazy."     Which clearly means I wanted something crazy.\\
251 - I mean, is this how boring you think I am?\\
252 - Penny, she asked you a question.\\
253 - Of course not.\\
254 - So you thought that I would like quilting?\\
255 - - Well, don't you?\\
256 - - Of course I like quilting!\\
257 - It's the slowest way to make a blanket!\\
258 - But this is my bachelorette party!\\
259 - It's supposed to be fun and wild and full of bad decisions.\\
260 - - Hey, we can make bad decisions.\\
261 - - Yeah.\\
262 - She had two kids back-to-back and I thought you'd like this,     so we're off to a good start.\\
263 - Come on, let's go somewhere we can do body shots     off shirtless bartenders.\\
264 - Yes.\\
265 - I don't know.\\
266 - That might be too much.\\
267 - All right, you know what, why don't we stay home, have a little wine...\\
268 - What are you not getting about this?!\\
269 - Dr. Wolcott, your work on time is revolutionary.\\
270 - I would say thank you,     but, in my theory of time,     you've already called my work revolutionary,     I've already thanked you,     and I hate repeating myself,     so let's move on.\\
271 - Wait a minute, are-are you saying that time     has multiple dimensions, the same as space?\\
272 - No.\\
273 - No, I'm not saying it--     the math is saying it.\\
274 - Though it is the math that I invented,     so, yes, I guess I am saying it.\\
275 - You understanding any of this?\\
276 - I haven't understood anything since poop tomato.\\
277 - My goodness,     - this is incredible.\\
278 - - See,     I-I'm just not seeing where string theory fits     into all this, and that's where I think that you and I     could be of help to each other.\\
279 - Thank you.\\
280 - I'd be honored.\\
281 - All right.\\
282 - Allow me to show you my most recent journal.\\
283 - Sheldon's right.\\
284 - This guy, this guy's brilliant.\\
285 - Yeah, I mean, he's a little...\\
286 - kooky,     but a mind that can reconceptualize time     probably has a reason for keeping a jar     of toenail clippings that we just don't understand.\\
287 - I could spend months up here just going through his math.\\
288 - I think Sheldon might.\\
289 - Great.\\
290 - Who's gonna tell Amy     we lost her fiancé to a madman in the mountains?\\
291 - Hey, I drove.\\
292 - This is so exciting.\\
293 - Can we do a body shot?\\
294 - I've always wanted to do a body shot.\\
295 - Also, what's a body shot?\\
296 - It's when you take a drink out of a stranger's belly button.\\
297 - Ew.\\
298 - No, thanks.\\
299 - What if they have an outie?\\
300 - Does it just spill everywhere?\\
301 - Okay, look, we've got all night.\\
302 - Let's just take it easy.\\
303 - We can...\\
304 - I'm getting married!\\
305 - (cheering)\\
306 - Here you go.\\
307 - First round is on the house.\\
308 - - Ooh.\\
309 - - Hey there.\\
310 - Do you do body shots?\\
311 - Oh, she said she didn't want one.\\
312 - Mind your business.\\
313 - Cheers!\\
314 - (whoops)\\
315 - Amy?\\
316 - Amy?\\
317 - Should we get her home?\\
318 - Why?\\
319 - She's sound asleep, and we have sliders coming.\\
320 - One more round!\\
321 - So, how would this work     in the context of a singularity?\\
322 - Yes, that's-that's a tricky bit to explain.\\
323 - I assume you're familiar with non-abelian group theory.\\
324 - Oh, and how.\\
325 - You never forget your first group theory.\\
326 - Listen, I'm gonna put on a pot of coffee,     because there is a lot of math to go through.\\
327 - And he said he didn't want a wild bachelor party.\\
328 - Excuse me?\\
329 - Oh, uh, Sheldon's getting married in a month.\\
330 - Oh!\\
331 - Congratulations.\\
332 - Yeah, I'm a married man myself.\\
333 - Oh, really?\\
334 - Is she here?\\
335 - And alive?\\
336 - A-And can people other than you see her?\\
337 - She lives in Munich.\\
338 - It's a perfect marriage.\\
339 - We focus on our work     and send each other cards every year on our birthdays.\\
340 - Hey, wait, what-what month is it?\\
341 - Uh, April.\\
342 - Most years.\\
343 - The point is     we give each other space.\\
344 - I give her Europe, she gives me South America.\\
345 - That's where she thinks I'm living.\\
346 - (laughs)\\
347 - I-I've never considered a long-distance marriage.\\
348 - Well, listen, if you want to be a great scientist,     you can't afford to be distracted.\\
349 - Hey, where are my manners?\\
350 - You fellas must be hungry.\\
351 - Do you like rabbit?\\
352 - - Yeah.\\
353 - - Sure.\\
354 - - Sounds good.\\
355 - Okay.\\
356 - But can you tell the difference between rabbit and squirrel?\\
357 - - No.\\
358 - - Don't think so.\\
359 - - Probably not.\\
360 - Great!\\
361 - We're having rabbit.\\
362 - Be right back!\\
363 - (door shuts)\\
364 - It is amazing how much he's accomplished     by isolating himself from the distractions of day-to-day life.\\
365 - Okay, please don't tell me you want to live like this.\\
366 - See, that's the strange thing.\\
367 - I don't.\\
368 - What is wrong with me?\\
369 - Why don't I want this?\\
370 - Look at how cool it all is.\\
371 - Nothing is wrong with you.\\
372 - You have friends,     you have a fiancée, you have a full life.\\
373 - You know what,     you're right.\\
374 - Thank you for bringing me up here.\\
375 - But I think I'm ready to go home now.\\
376 - Really?\\
377 - You don't want to stay for dinner     and talk more science?\\
378 - No.\\
379 - No, we better go.\\
380 - I miss Amy.\\
381 - And my phone.\\
382 - (gunshot in distance)\\
383 - Also, I'm from Texas,     and I can taste the difference between rabbit and squirrel.\\
384 - (dramatic music playing on TV)\\
385 - (gasping)\\
386 - Oh, look who's back!\\
387 - There she is!\\
388 - What happened?\\
389 - How did we get here?\\
390 - You don't remember anything?\\
391 - I remember taking some shots, and then...\\
392 - that's it.\\
393 - Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?\\
394 - You kind of did.\\
395 - At my own bachelorette party?\\
396 - I'm so lame.\\
397 - Well, you didn't pass out before you did     all kinds of fun stuff.\\
398 - What did I do?\\
399 - What did you do?     What'd she do?\\
400 - Um...\\
401 - well, you don't remember Riverdancing on top of the bar?\\
402 - I did that?\\
403 - Yeah, you did!\\
404 - Mm-hmm.\\
405 - But I don't know how to Riverdance.\\
406 - Didn't stop you from teaching all those shirtless firemen.\\
407 - I saw shirtless firemen?\\
408 - Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.\\
409 - Did I flash anybody?\\
410 - How about everybody?     I can't believe it.\\
411 - I'm so embarrassed.\\
412 - You didn't take any pictures, did you?\\
413 - Oh, no, we would never do that to you.\\
414 - Yeah.\\
415 - But if there were pictures,     they would be crazy.     You guys are good friends.\\
416 - PENNY: Mm.\\
417 - (traditional Irish music playing)\\
418 - Dinner!\\
419 - Guys?\\
420 - I can't believe they left without saying good-bye.\\
421 - Wait a minute, what if they stole my work?\\
422 - Wait a minute!\\
423 - What if they were never here at all?\\
424 - Wait a minute!\\
425 - What if they haven't gotten here yet     but they're on their way?!\\
426 - I better tidy up.\\
427 - Hello.\\
428 - Welcome back.\\
429 - How'd it go?\\
430 - Well, Dr.\\
431 - Wolcott's theories of time     might save my new interpretation of string theory.\\
432 - Oh, well, that's exciting.\\
433 - It is.\\
434 - How was your bachelorette party?\\
435 - Well, I was in a bar,     and I saw some shirtless men.\\
436 - They were firemen, and they fought over me.\\
437 - But Penny and Bernadette got me out of there     before the victor got my spoils.\\
438 - I see.\\
439 - What's the matter?\\
440 - You look glum.\\
441 - Amy, would you still love me     if I wasn't who you thought I was?\\
442 - What are you talking about?\\
443 - Well, what if it turns out     I'm not the single-minded, science-obsessed recluse     who puts his work above everything and everybody else     that you fell in love with?\\
444 - What if I'm not the straightlaced,     buttoned-up, quilting queen you thought I was?\\
445 - What if I'm a...\\
446 - Riverdancing wild woman?\\
447 - I'd still love you.\\
448 - I'd still love you, too.\\
449 - Do you really know how to Riverdance?\\
450 - You tell me.\\
451 - I'm the only man you do that for.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Comet Polarization}
1 - WOLOWITZ: What are you doing?\\
2 - Pigeon check for Sheldon.\\
3 - North side's all clear!\\
4 - Great.\\
5 - Let's look at some planets!\\
6 - Hey, why'd you lug your telescope all the way over here?\\
7 - Leonard has one in our apartment.\\
8 - Yeah, I'm gonna use Leonard's.\\
9 - Might as well hold my hand up like this and squint.\\
10 - I don't know.\\
11 - It seemed pretty good.\\
12 - You know, once when the cable went out,    I watched an entire episode of The Bachelor    on a TV across the street.\\
13 - This one's more of a professional model.\\
14 - So was the girl he picked!\\
15 - This baby's got a ten-inch diameter with f/   ACF optics.\\
16 - WOLOWITZ: And tonight    Mercury is at its highest elongation.\\
17 - It makes far-away things seem close, and Mercury is a planet.\\
18 - I know Mercury is a planet.\\
19 - But the-the other thing was helpful.\\
20 - Oh.\\
21 - Look at that.\\
22 - - Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store!\\
23 - - What did he say?\\
24 - Uh, "Next time you're in Pasadena,    "check out The Comic Center.\\
25 - "Great vibe, old school,    the owner really knows his stuff."    Isn't that amazing?\\
26 - Well, uh, it's no Sandman, but I guess we can't expect    everything he writes to be a masterpiece.\\
27 - When was he in your store?\\
28 - I have no idea.\\
29 - I think I would remember that.\\
30 - Obviously, vibranium is the most powerful metal in comics.\\
31 - What, more powerful than adamantium?\\
32 - He's right.\\
33 - Wolverine's claws, Ultron's outer shell.\\
34 - Need I go on?\\
35 - You don't need to, but you probably will.\\
36 - What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?\\
37 - Good point.\\
38 - Strong as a metal and fierce as a fashion choice.\\
39 - GAIMAN: You know,    Thor's hammer's pretty powerful,    and in the comics, it's made out of enchanted uru.\\
40 - Uh, yeah, I think it's the enchantment    that's powerful, not the uru,    but, uh, thanks for playing.\\
41 - Oh, man, I can't believe Neil Gaiman came in,    and we weren't even there.\\
42 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
43 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  \\
44 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
45 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
46 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids  \\
47 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
48 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
49 -  Bang!     \\
50 - Can you see Mercury?\\
51 - Can you see it?\\
52 - One second.\\
53 - You know, the Greek version of Mercury, Hermes,    was worshipped in Athens    by the carving of giant wooden phalluses.\\
54 - Please, Amy,    get your mind out of the ancient Athenian gutter.\\
55 - Got another follower.\\
56 - I'm blowing up.\\
57 - Great.\\
58 - How many does that make?\\
59 - High double digits.\\
60 - The nineties?\\
61 - Mid double digits.\\
62 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Hey, uh,    Penny, do you want to check this out?\\
63 - Yeah, sure.\\
64 - All right, just, uh, look through here,    and if you want to take a picture, just push that button.\\
65 - Okay.\\
66 - Oh, what is that?\\
67 - (gasps)\\
68 - Is it Mercury?\\
69 - I'm really jonesing for Mercury.\\
70 - I think it's a little early    for Mercury to be visible yet.\\
71 - Playing hard to get.\\
72 - I like that in a planet.\\
73 - No, there's something fuzzy.\\
74 - Is it your teen years?\\
75 - No.\\
76 - Yes.\\
77 - Shut up.\\
78 - Look.\\
79 - Look at that.\\
80 - I think I see something.\\
81 - It could just be your eyelash.\\
82 - It's not an eyelash!\\
83 - Okay, well, uh, take a picture.\\
84 - Let's see.\\
85 - Okay.\\
86 - Here.\\
87 - Hmm.\\
88 - I do see something.\\
89 - (gasps)\\
90 - Told you.\\
91 - What is it?\\
92 - I don't know.\\
93 - Maybe it's a comet.\\
94 - That would be so cool.\\
95 - STUART: You guys want    to see a real star, look over here.\\
96 - What?\\
97 - I just got retweeted...\\
98 - by Patton Oswalt's brother.\\
99 - (crowd chatter)\\
100 - So, this is really where Neil Gaiman shops?\\
101 - Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage, Natalie Portman.\\
102 - The list goes on.\\
103 - They all come here?\\
104 - Unless I'm lying.\\
105 - Who are all these people?\\
106 - What?\\
107 - Is this a flash mob?\\
108 - Are they dancing?\\
109 - I don't know what today's dancing looks like.\\
110 - Hey, guys.\\
111 - That tweet actually got people     to come in.\\
112 - Isn't that great?\\
113 - No.\\
114 - I liked the way the store was before.\\
115 - You mean empty and sad?\\
116 - Yes, it was perfect.\\
117 - Like a funeral home that sells Pokémon cards.\\
118 - What am I supposed to do now     if I want to hang out and read a comic book?\\
119 - Go sit on the couch.\\
120 - Next to a stranger?\\
121 - If I'm going to sit, read, and ignore a woman,     it's going to be my fiancée.\\
122 - Why are you being such a baby about the crowds?\\
123 - You go to Comic-Con.\\
124 - You-- I'm sorry.\\
125 - You're comparing this place to Comic-Con?\\
126 - Well, can I go to the bathroom here next to a Wookiee     who got his zipper stuck in his fur?\\
127 - Wow.\\
128 - We go to Comic-Con for different reasons.\\
129 - You know what?\\
130 - Just give me a copy of Action Comics     ,     and I'll be on my way.\\
131 - Sorry.\\
132 - All out.\\
133 - Now you just let people come in and buy them?\\
134 - I didn't realize your soul was also for sale.\\
135 - STUART: Well,     it wasn't, but, uh, make me an offer.\\
136 - (phone chimes)\\
137 - Who is that?\\
138 - Sheldon.\\
139 - Who is he mad at?\\
140 - Neil Gaiman.\\
141 - Who's that?\\
142 - Not us.\\
143 - Great.\\
144 - (knocking)\\
145 - Guys.\\
146 - Hi.\\
147 - Hey.\\
148 - So, guess what.\\
149 - That indeed was a comet last night,     and it turns out, no one's seen it before.\\
150 - (laughing): Wow.\\
151 - Really?\\
152 - Look at that!\\
153 - I discovered a comet!\\
154 - Oh!\\
155 - What do you mean you discovered it?\\
156 - Well, I'm the one who saw it.\\
157 - In my telescope that I positioned.\\
158 - All you did was look into it.\\
159 - Well, you both discovered it.\\
160 - You can put both your names on the registration form.\\
161 - Actually, we can't.\\
162 - Why not?\\
163 - Because when I filled it out, it asked for name of discoverer,     and I put "Rajesh Koothrappali" because...\\
164 - because that's who I am, and that's what I did.\\
165 - Are you kidding me?\\
166 - Well, he is the one who knew it was a comet.\\
167 - No, he didn't.\\
168 - He thought it was an eyelash!\\
169 - And you thought it was a fuzzy streak.\\
170 - I mean, do you even know what a comet is?\\
171 - Yeah, the thing I saw first.\\
172 - I honestly don't think that that qualifies as a discovery.\\
173 - But I took the picture.\\
174 - Because I told you to!\\
175 - Like, if a monkey took the picture,     did it discover the comet?\\
176 - Excuse me?!\\
177 - (stammering): Uh, he didn't mean monkey.\\
178 - - Get the hell out of my apartment!\\
179 - - And she didn't mean that.\\
180 - Actually, I think she did.\\
181 - You should go.\\
182 - You look great.\\
183 - Oh, thanks.\\
184 - Would you believe this is actually a dress     from before I was pregnant?\\
185 - Well, it's not a competition,     but I wore this suit to my Bar Mitzvah.\\
186 - Where's Stuart?\\
187 - I told him we had a  :   reservation.\\
188 - Well, I'll call him.\\
189 - (ringtone plays)\\
190 - Comic Center, where the real superhero is you.\\
191 - Stuart, you're supposed to be babysitting.\\
192 - Oh!\\
193 - Shoot.\\
194 - That was tonight.\\
195 - I forgot.\\
196 - The store's been really busy.\\
197 - Well, when can you get here?\\
198 - Um, I don't think I can.\\
199 - Listen to this.\\
200 - I-I was ringing up a customer, and I heard someone say,     "Hey, there's a line," and I looked, and there was.\\
201 - Come on.\\
202 - You can't do this to us.\\
203 - I am really sorry.\\
204 - I will make it up to you.\\
205 - But it won't be with a Val Kilmer Batman figurine     (laughing): because some sucker's buying that right now.\\
206 - (laughs)\\
207 - Not you.\\
208 - This is great.\\
209 - He says he has to work.\\
210 - Oh, it's okay.\\
211 - We can have date night another night.\\
212 - But you got all dressed up.\\
213 - We were supposed to have dinner and romance.\\
214 - We'll just have to divide and conquer.\\
215 - I'll go to dinner,     and you can stay home with the Internet and have romance.\\
216 - Okay, look, I Googled it.\\
217 - I took the picture, so it's my discovery.\\
218 - (scoffs)\\
219 - He stole my comet.\\
220 - I know, but on the other hand, do you really care?\\
221 - Yes, I care.\\
222 - This happens to me all the time.\\
223 - People take one look at me     and assume I don't know what I'm talking about.\\
224 - Oh, I'm sure that's not true.\\
225 - I'm sorry.\\
226 - Are you saying     I don't know what I'm talking about?\\
227 - No, I'm not saying anything...\\
228 - ever again.\\
229 - Look, I'm serious.\\
230 - The other day at work,     I had this great idea, but no one was listening to me.\\
231 - And then five minutes later, Paul said the same thing,     and they practically carried him around the room.\\
232 - Oh, well, what was it?\\
233 - Well, CPK for lunch,     but that's just one example.\\
234 - It also happens with all     the doctors I have to deal with.\\
235 - You know, they're so condescending.\\
236 - I'm so sick of letting this stuff slide.\\
237 - I found that comet.\\
238 - Why should I let Raj say he found it?\\
239 - I know you're right, but he is our friend,     and this could be good for his career.\\
240 - Okay, so you agree with me, but he still gets his way?\\
241 - Ah, there you go.\\
242 - Everybody wins.\\
243 - My God, you're such a people-pleaser.\\
244 - You can't stand making anyone angry.\\
245 - Why would I want to make anyone angry?\\
246 - 'Cause it would mean you were on my side.\\
247 - Oh, I am on your side.\\
248 - Hey, hey.\\
249 - Let's not forget who you're really mad at here-- Raj.\\
250 - Oh, and Paul.\\
251 - Paul sucks, right?\\
252 - But don't tell him I said that.\\
253 - Hey, Howard, did you see that...?\\
254 - (shrieks)\\
255 - I'm over here, Sheldon.\\
256 - That was a close one.\\
257 - I almost went home with that guy.\\
258 - You doing okay?\\
259 - Do we need to go?\\
260 - No, I'm fine.\\
261 - I admit all these people did take me by surprise at first,     but I've learned that I can accept change.\\
262 - S-Since when?\\
263 - I managed it when Amy switched her shampoo     from Prell to Prell for oily hair.\\
264 - Hmm?\\
265 - Although I do miss the way     her head used to slide off the pillow.\\
266 - May I help you?\\
267 - Who are you?\\
268 - Oh, I'm Denise, the new assistant manager.\\
269 - Nope.\\
270 - Can you believe it?\\
271 - In the past decade,     I have spent thousands of dollars in that store,     and this is the thanks I get.\\
272 - You're right.\\
273 - I mean, he could at least get you a mug.\\
274 - He gave me a mug.\\
275 - What do you think I'm drinking out of?\\
276 - Do you even pay attention?\\
277 - Honestly, less and less.\\
278 - Amy, the comic book store     is like my version of the country in Black Panther.     Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get really offensive     to certain groups.\\
279 - The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem,     and they wanted to keep it that way,     because they knew if they opened it up to the world,     everything that was special about it would get ruined.\\
280 - Are you done?\\
281 - Yes.\\
282 - (relieved sigh): Oh, okay.\\
283 - That both made sense and wasn't offensive.\\
284 - And to make things worse, Stuart hired some woman.\\
285 - There we go.\\
286 - No...\\
287 - I'm not annoyed that she's a woman.\\
288 - I'm annoyed, and she's a woman.\\
289 - No, I get that.\\
290 - I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.\\
291 - It's just, Stuart knows my likes and dislikes.\\
292 - And I can count on his discretion     if I pick up the occasional back issue     of Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen.     Which I don't.\\
293 - Well, don't think of her as a stranger.\\
294 - Just think of her as a...\\
295 - a friend you haven't berated, lectured or condescended to yet.\\
296 - I hadn't thought of it that way.\\
297 - Thank you.\\
298 - You're welcome.\\
299 - You're wise,     and you smell like books.\\
300 - You really are the whole package.\\
301 - Raj, just help me out.\\
302 - Penny's pretty mad about this comet thing.\\
303 - Well, I'm sorry she's upset.\\
304 - But she didn't discover it.\\
305 - Oh, come on,     you know she was a part of it.\\
306 - Just add her name to the registration.\\
307 - But I already told everyone at work that I did it.\\
308 - My boss was so excited,     he started calling me Captain Comet.\\
309 - Which is better     than his last nickname for me: Dr.\\
310 - Doughnuts.\\
311 - Because one time I had two doughnuts.\\
312 - And two times I had three doughnuts.\\
313 - I guess you're just gonna have to swallow your pride.\\
314 - I, I, I can't do that.\\
315 - Sure you can-- just pretend it's two or three doughnuts.\\
316 - You don't understand.\\
317 - Leonard, I need this.\\
318 - My last big discovery was:     if you press your upper lip hard enough,     you can block a sneeze.\\
319 - I told you that.\\
320 - (groans)\\
321 - This is all my fault.\\
322 - I brought this upon myself.\\
323 - (smacks lips)\\
324 - I'm a bad scientist.\\
325 - I'm a selfish person.\\
326 - No, no,     don't get upset.\\
327 - You're not a bad person.\\
328 - Just let me...\\
329 - talk to Penny.\\
330 - I'm-I'm sure I can     make her understand.\\
331 - Thank you.\\
332 - You're a good friend, Leonard.\\
333 - I'm glad you think so, 'cause I may be living here soon.\\
334 - Just look at her over there.\\
335 - She just started,     and she gets to put up "Staff Picks."     I've been coming here for ten years--     I still can't put up "Sheldon Dislikes."     I talked to her yesterday.\\
336 - She really seems to know her stuff.\\
337 - Challenge accepted.\\
338 - That is not what that was.\\
339 - Excuse me.\\
340 - I was wondering     if you could recommend something.\\
341 - Oh, sure.\\
342 - You want to tell me what you like?\\
343 - I would not.\\
344 - All right, well, you're wearing a Green Lantern shirt,     so I'm guessing you're a DC fan.\\
345 - Although that's from the Alan Scott era,     so you're probably not super into the current run.\\
346 - How would you feel about an alternate history     where World War I was fought with dragons and magic?\\
347 - That's what I wanted the theme     of my tenth birthday party to be!\\
348 - Here.\\
349 - Check this out.\\
350 - It's by Kurt Busiek.\\
351 - GAIMAN: You know, if you're interested     in alternate histories,     Neil Gaiman wrote one called     .     I'm sorry, we're in the middle of something here.\\
352 - It is pretty good, actually.\\
353 - He takes the Marvel superheroes     and he puts them into Elizabethan England.\\
354 - Let me guess-- everyone thinks the X-Men are witches.\\
355 - Yeah.\\
356 - Why don't you take this home, and if you don't like it,     return it and I'll give you your money back.\\
357 - Just don't tell Stuart.\\
358 - Stuart who?\\
359 - Hey.\\
360 - Where have you been?\\
361 - I went to yell at Raj.\\
362 - And?\\
363 - Is he gonna give me back my comet?\\
364 - Interesting thing.\\
365 - Did you cave?\\
366 - Maybe I did, or...\\
367 - maybe I did.\\
368 - But I did realize something.\\
369 - I-I don't need to fight your battles.\\
370 - You...\\
371 - you are     a strong and independent woman.\\
372 - You have your own voice.\\
373 - And, to quote another strong woman,     Katy Perry, it's time to hear you roar.\\
374 - Did you just think of that on your way home?\\
375 - What do you want from me?\\
376 - The song was on in the car.\\
377 - But it doesn't mean     that it's not true.\\
378 - Well, you make a good point.\\
379 - I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.\\
380 - I know I don't say it enough,     but you go, girl.\\
381 - That was enough.\\
382 - What's all this?\\
383 - Well, we missed our date night,     and Stuart's working again, so I thought we could have     a date night here at home.\\
384 - (clicks tongue)\\
385 - Aw, that's so sweet.\\
386 - Oh.\\
387 - So...\\
388 - is that really what you're wearing     to our date night?\\
389 - Well, Stuart's not here and the kids are sleeping.\\
390 - I could wear nothing.\\
391 - You might want to hold off on that--     we're starting with soup.\\
392 - (laughs)\\
393 - Hey!\\
394 - Wha...?\\
395 - I thought you were working late again.\\
396 - I was, but Denise has got it covered.\\
397 - Oh.\\
398 - Oh...\\
399 - the funniest thing happened today.\\
400 - You know the, uh, receipt tape in the cash register?\\
401 - It ran out.\\
402 - (chuckles)\\
403 - I didn't even know it could do that.\\
404 - You know, we were just sitting down to dinner.\\
405 - Oh.\\
406 - Perfect timing.\\
407 - I'll go wash up.\\
408 - There goes date night.\\
409 - Are you kidding?\\
410 - Stuart's here!\\
411 - Get your purse.\\
412 - We're going out.\\
413 - What about the dinner you made?\\
414 - Right.\\
415 - Hey, Stuart!\\
416 - That can of soup sitting by the stove, that's for you!\\
417 - You made canned soup for date night?\\
418 - And you wore sweatpants.\\
419 - Let's go.\\
420 - Oh, and it turns out Denise is also really excited     for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man,     because he was her favorite Spider-Man writer, too.\\
421 - How about that?\\
422 - Oh!\\
423 - And guess who goes to art school right here in Pasadena.\\
424 - Hmm.\\
425 - I don't know.\\
426 - Denise?\\
427 - You're a good guesser, Amy.\\
428 - Not as good as Denise, though.\\
429 - She thought I would like this comic, Arrowsmith,     and she was right.\\
430 - Well, was the store crowded?\\
431 - I bet it was.\\
432 - I know you hate that.\\
433 - It was.\\
434 - But if it weren't for the crowds,     Stuart never would have hired Denise,     and she's the best.\\
435 - You must be Denise.\\
436 - Oh, yeah.\\
437 - How can I help you?\\
438 - I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancée.\\
439 - Oh.\\
440 - I got to be honest,     I wasn't a hundred percent sure you were real.\\
441 - Oh, I am.\\
442 - And I heard you and Sheldon had a great time today     talking about comic books.\\
443 - We did.\\
444 - Great.\\
445 - Here's what's gonna happen.\\
446 - You're gonna teach me how to do that.\\
447 - Do what?\\
448 - Pretend to like comic books.\\
449 - Oh, no, I actually like comic books.\\
450 - All right, let's not get hung up on semantics.\\
451 - It's late, we got a lot of work to do.\\
452 - (loud footsteps approaching)\\
453 - (knocking)\\
454 - I'm sorry.\\
455 - I haven't even said anything yet.\\
456 - I know, but I heard your footsteps coming up the stairs,     and they sounded angry.\\
457 - They are angry.\\
458 - I'm mad at you.\\
459 - And you have every right to be, okay?\\
460 - I was being...\\
461 - I was being a jerk.\\
462 - We did this together, and I hogged all of the credit.\\
463 - And after you've been such a good friend to me over the years.\\
464 - Like, I wouldn't even be able to talk to women if it wasn't for you, so...\\
465 - so I'm...\\
466 - I'm gonna make sure that your name is on the comet.\\
467 - Thank you.\\
468 - Even if it's professionally embarrassing.\\
469 - You know, or maybe put me on thin ice at work.\\
470 - I may lose my funding.\\
471 - I still, uh...\\
472 - still want to make this right.\\
473 - Good.\\
474 - Bye.\\
475 - That worked way better with Leonard.\\
476 - (door opens)\\
477 - - Hello.\\
478 - - Hi.\\
479 - Why are you reading a comic book?\\
480 - Denise recommended it to me.\\
481 - It's the Rebirth Omnibus.     She thought it would be a good entry point for me     into the DC Universe-- and I have to say,     - I really do like...\\
482 - - You know, Amy,     Amy, I've talked a lot about comic books lately,     can we talk about something else?
\subsection {Episode 22: The Monetary Insufficiency}
1 - What-what are you doing?\\
2 - The light is red so I came to a stop.\\
3 - You're in a stolen cop car with a dead hooker in the trunk.\\
4 - You don't have to obey traffic laws.\\
5 - I know I don't have to.\\
6 - The fun is choosing to.\\
7 - Hey.\\
8 - Missed you guys at the faculty mixer.\\
9 - Ah, you should have been there; dessert was bananas.\\
10 - Sorry, that was misleading.\\
11 - The dessert was pie,    but the pie was bananas.\\
12 - Actually, the pie was cherry,    but the taste of the pie was...\\
13 - bananas.\\
14 - Those mixers are such a waste of university money.\\
15 - If they spent less money    on frivolous nonsense and more money on science,    we'd all be better off.\\
16 - You're a theoretical physicist.\\
17 - What more do you need than an office and a whiteboard?\\
18 - Someday, my new formulas on entropy decrease    due to quantum decoherence will need to be tested    and that will require funding.\\
19 - Your theories are pretty abstract.\\
20 - I wouldn't even know how to    design an experiment to prove them.\\
21 - Says the experimental physicist.\\
22 - Well, I know a place the university can make some cuts.\\
23 - Bye, Leonard.\\
24 - KOOTHRAPPALI: One second, one second.\\
25 - He's got a point.\\
26 - In order to corroborate your string theory research,    you'd have to create a black hole.\\
27 - Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?\\
28 - Perhaps, but we'd all go to the grave knowing I was right.\\
29 - I guess you could create    a contained microscopic black hole.\\
30 - Huh.\\
31 - Interesting.\\
32 - Welcome back, Leonard.\\
33 - Sorry, you're out.\\
34 - What did I do?\\
35 - Exactly.\\
36 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state  \\
37 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  \\
38 -  The Earth began to cool  \\
39 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
40 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids  \\
41 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
42 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
43 -  Bang!   \\
44 - Ooh, this one's pretty.\\
45 - Mm.\\
46 - My mother wouldn't approve;    shows too much clavicle.\\
47 - She calls it "the bosom's welcome mat."    I can't wait to get drunk    and pick a fight with her at your wedding.\\
48 - It's just so hard to tell what will look good on me.\\
49 - No.\\
50 - This is just to give you ideas.\\
51 - You know, do-do you want something simple and elegant?\\
52 - I mean, do you want a train?\\
53 - Ooh, we're talking about trains.\\
54 - Not the kind of trains you like.\\
55 - Oh, I like all kinds of trains-- steam, diesel,    coal, elevated, bullet.\\
56 - I defy you to name a train that I don't like.\\
57 - The kind on the back of a wedding dress?\\
58 - I did not see that coming.\\
59 - Good job.\\
60 - But while we're on the subject of fashion,    I'm asking the university for some funding tomorrow.\\
61 - What should I wear?\\
62 - Mm.\\
63 - Well, I've got a push-up bra I can loan you    that always gets me free drinks.\\
64 - How much money are you asking for?\\
65 - $    million.\\
66 - Then I'd go no bra.\\
67 - What do you need that kind of money for?\\
68 - I have figured out an experimental design    that may corroborate my latest thinking on string theory.\\
69 - I just need  ,   high-power lasers    to compress    micrograms of gold into a small enough volume    to make a microscopic black hole.\\
70 - Just nod.\\
71 - Mmm.\\
72 - Sheldon, they're not gonna give you half a billion dollars.\\
73 - I mean, they won't even give me that much    and I keep promising I can make people's brains "grow younger."    Can you?\\
74 - (whispers): No.\\
75 - Shh.\\
76 - But I need it.\\
77 - It's the only way to settle the contradictions    between gravity and quantum mechanics.\\
78 - Well, it's too much money, you can't ask for that all at once.\\
79 - Well, what if I ask for it in six easy installments    of $  ,   ,   .  ?\\
80 - Okay.\\
81 - What if you asked for $   million?\\
82 - I'm sorry, I'm trying to do science,    not hire Lady Gaga to come to my birthday.\\
83 - Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?\\
84 - Presumably, the wife of Lord Gaga.\\
85 - Sheldon, you know, Penny's got a point.\\
86 - Sometimes when you want something big from someone,     you-you got to be careful not to scare them away, you know?\\
87 - You got to start small and-and build up slowly,     even if it takes eight years.\\
88 - Eight long years.\\
89 - That's oddly specific.\\
90 - Have you ever done that?\\
91 - Nope.\\
92 - So with this level of high-power laser array,     we would actually be able     to solve the black hole information paradox     once and for all.\\
93 - That's impressive, and how much funding were you looking for?\\
94 - $   million.\\
95 - Really?\\
96 - You think you can build that for $   million?\\
97 - Not a chance.\\
98 - I'm sorry, then why are you asking me for it?\\
99 - Because once you've spent $   million,     you're much more likely to give me an additional   .\\
100 - So actually, what you're saying is with $   million,     you can build this.\\
101 - I can see why you'd think that, but no.\\
102 - You can't go to the board of trustees     and say you gave Sheldon Cooper $   million     and have nothing to show for it.\\
103 - No.\\
104 - The only way you'd be able     to save face is to double down.\\
105 - So    ?\\
106 - And then double again.\\
107 - ?\\
108 - And then-- good news-- not quite double again.\\
109 - So, uh, what do you say?\\
110 - We have a deal?\\
111 - He said no?\\
112 - No.\\
113 - That's only a two letter word.\\
114 - You're gonna have to double down.\\
115 - Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this sort of thing happens.\\
116 - Higgs had to wait almost    years     before they built a collider big enough to prove his theory.\\
117 - years?\\
118 - But I want to play with it now.\\
119 - KOOTHRAPPALI: You just have to wait for science     to catch up or technology to get cheaper.\\
120 - Think about, uh, DVD players--     they used to cost, like, a thousand dollars,     but just the other day I used one to smash a bug.\\
121 - Yeah, you-you just have to be patient.\\
122 - But what if while I'm being patient,     someone more relentless than me     badgers their university into giving them money?\\
123 - If there's someone more relentless than you,     I'd like to meet them.\\
124 - I would not.\\
125 - I'm not waiting for the university to come around.\\
126 - I'll find another way to raise the money.\\
127 - Ooh, if it's one of those booths where we can throw a pie at you,     I'm in for, like,    bucks.\\
128 - bucks if I can throw a DVD player.\\
129 - Would you like some champagne?\\
130 - Oh, thank you.\\
131 - - Thanks.\\
132 - - Sure.\\
133 - This is nice.\\
134 - What?\\
135 - Helping Amy find a dress or day drinking?\\
136 - It's just nice, okay?\\
137 - What do you think?\\
138 - (gasps)\\
139 - Amy, oh, my God.\\
140 - You look so beautiful.\\
141 - I feel beautiful.\\
142 - And look: both clavicles.\\
143 - Take that, Mom.\\
144 - You know what they say:     if you got 'em, flaunt 'em.\\
145 - Is it possible that the very first dress is the dress?\\
146 - Oh, don't be silly.\\
147 - You can't buy the first dress you try on.\\
148 - That'd be like marrying the first guy that you...\\
149 - You can't buy the first dress you try on.\\
150 - Little finger sandwiches, too.\\
151 - This place is amazing.\\
152 - Interesting thing     about finger sandwiches: you put enough of them together,     you got a sandwich.\\
153 - AMY: Uh, guys, we have a problem.\\
154 - - Are you okay?\\
155 - - What's wrong?\\
156 - I look amazing in all of these dresses!\\
157 - Wow.\\
158 - Look at your waist.\\
159 - Where you been hiding that thing?\\
160 - (giggles)\\
161 - Bernadette, stop.\\
162 - Penny, you say something nice now.\\
163 - Boy, you know, when Sheldon sees you in that dress,     he's gonna want to methodically take it off,     fold it up, carefully place it in a storage box,     label it, and then ravish you.\\
164 - Should I try on some more?\\
165 - Are you having fun?\\
166 - Am I having fun being beautiful?\\
167 - Of course I am!\\
168 - Great.\\
169 - Keep going.\\
170 - AMY: This is it.\\
171 - This is the one.\\
172 - Do you love it?\\
173 - Do you?\\
174 - I do.\\
175 - Wow.\\
176 - Also, wow.\\
177 - - Hello, Leonard.\\
178 - - Hi.\\
179 - Are you doing anything?\\
180 - No.\\
181 - I'm just sitting here at my desk     typing on my computer for nothing.\\
182 - That was my guess, but I didn't want to assume.\\
183 - Can you help me shoot my Kickstarter video?\\
184 - Do you really think people are gonna give you     half a billion dollars?\\
185 - Of course not, but if I can raise enough seed money     to show that I'm serious, I should be able     to attract some major investors.\\
186 - And look at the cool incentives I'm offering.\\
187 - "For $  ,   , I will examine your diet     and create a customized bathroom schedule."     That's fitting--    grand down the toilet.\\
188 - Well, how about this?\\
189 - For $   ,   , I will design the flag     of your house or apartment.\\
190 - And for $  million,     I will come over and tell you what's wrong with you.\\
191 - Aw, and all these years, I've been getting that for free.\\
192 - Don't be smug, Leonard.\\
193 - That's one of the things that's wrong with you.\\
194 - Well, that was a successful trip.\\
195 - Yes.\\
196 - Amy found a dress that she liked.\\
197 - She sure did.\\
198 - She found     a dress that looked like...\\
199 - like it made her happy.\\
200 - She-she did look happy.\\
201 - I mean, her face was just glowing, so...\\
202 - Yeah, we should make sure the photographer knows     to just really...\\
203 - get in there.\\
204 - Mm.\\
205 - So we agree it's awful?\\
206 - That dress should be set on fire!\\
207 - Should we say something?\\
208 - No, we can't.\\
209 - But don't you think she brought us with her     'cause she wants our honest opinion?\\
210 - No one wants that.\\
211 - I do.\\
212 - No, ya don't.\\
213 - I don't want her to look back     and think she made some awful mistake.\\
214 - You mean like your dumb Cookie Monster tattoo?\\
215 - See?\\
216 - Was that fun?\\
217 - Someone's gonna say something.\\
218 - It should be us now instead of everyone at her wedding.\\
219 - Okay, but as long as we do it gently.\\
220 - And together.\\
221 - Well, what about my dress?\\
222 - Don't you like it?\\
223 - - I don't.\\
224 - - It's beautiful.\\
225 - Hey, Stuart, I'd like to sell some comic books.\\
226 - Oh.\\
227 - Well, I know all about that.\\
228 - Step one is flunk out of art school.\\
229 - Well, why are you selling 'em?\\
230 - The university is refusing to fund my experiment,     so I need to raise money and do it on my own.\\
231 - Ah.\\
232 - How much do you need?\\
233 - For a start, I'm trying to raise $   ,   .\\
234 - Well, I hope you have that rare Superman     printed on the skin of actual Superman.\\
235 - I know you're making a joke,     but I really do have some valuable issues in here.\\
236 - And this is just the first box of many.\\
237 - All right, let's see what you got.\\
238 - Huh.\\
239 - Is this a complete run of Todd McFarlane's Spawn?     (gasps loudly)\\
240 - Yes.\\
241 - Ooh, look at this.\\
242 - Giant-Size X-Men number one,     Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.\\
243 - Yeah.\\
244 - I know what it is.\\
245 - I'm the one who bought it,     bagged it, boarded it and taped it shut     while wearing white cotton gloves.\\
246 - Okay, well, you know,     I'm gonna have to open it to assess its condition.\\
247 - Just be gentle.\\
248 - It's never felt the touch of a man before.\\
249 - You don't seem like you really want to sell these.\\
250 - Of course I don't want to sell these.\\
251 - These are all important to me,     but not as important as science,     and if this is the sacrifice I need to make, then so be it.\\
252 - Okay.\\
253 - Uh, why don't you leave these here with me,     and I'll-I'll price 'em out for you.\\
254 - Is it okay if I stand here and watch?\\
255 - Sure.\\
256 - If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.\\
257 - Hey, I can't believe you just threw me under the bus.\\
258 - I know, right?\\
259 - That was crazy.\\
260 - Well...\\
261 - Do you know how that makes me look?\\
262 - - Uh, that's an easy one-- bad.\\
263 - - Well...\\
264 - Why didn't you tell her that you didn't like the dress, either?\\
265 - I mean, what happened to our united front?\\
266 - I'm sorry.\\
267 - Is this your first day being a girl?\\
268 - Ooh, did your mom pack your lunch?\\
269 - (chuckles)\\
270 - Of course not.\\
271 - Do you know how much it costs to pack a tuna fish sandwich     in dry ice and overnight it from Texas?\\
272 - Well, I do, and my mother says it's too expensive.\\
273 - I like tuna fish.\\
274 - Do you want it?\\
275 - I'll sell it to you for $ ,   .\\
276 - How's the fundraising going?\\
277 - Oh, that depends.\\
278 - Raj, was that a "yes"?\\
279 - No.\\
280 - It's going badly.\\
281 - How much have you raised?\\
282 - Well, with my Kickstarter campaign,     selling my collectibles, and the money in my bank account,     about $  ,   .\\
283 - Wow.\\
284 - That's a lot.\\
285 - Yeah, not enough.\\
286 - It's so frustrating that science should be held hostage     to the almighty dollar.\\
287 - Well, don't give up.\\
288 - You'll find that money somewhere.\\
289 - - You really think so?\\
290 - - No,     but it's good that he has a hobby.\\
291 - You ever thought of going to Vegas?\\
292 - Can you be more specific?\\
293 - Las Vegas?\\
294 - Oh, you mean gambling.\\
295 - Mm.\\
296 - Oh.\\
297 - Well, that's not the worst idea.\\
298 - Um, it is the worst idea, and I'm including the year     that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.\\
299 - Ordinary people can't beat a casino,     but mathematicians and scientists,     they do it all the time.\\
300 - Yeah, a group of students     from MIT took Las Vegas for millions, and that's MIT.\\
301 - Howard went there.\\
302 - Come on, Sheldon.\\
303 - I'll give you a ride out to the desert right now.\\
304 - No one is going to Vegas.\\
305 - No, we weren't gonna make it to Vegas.\\
306 - Hi.\\
307 - Do you have a minute?\\
308 - Depends.\\
309 - Is what I'm wearing okay,     or should I go change first?\\
310 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
311 - I never should have said I didn't like your dress.\\
312 - It's your wedding, and all that matters is     that you feel beautiful.\\
313 - Thank you.\\
314 - So, are...\\
315 - are we good?\\
316 - No, we're not good.\\
317 - You ruined my dress.\\
318 - Well, why?\\
319 - I just said you should wear it.\\
320 - Well, I can't wear it now.\\
321 - I mean, I know you hate it.\\
322 - That's all I'm gonna be thinking about.\\
323 - No, I don't hate it.\\
324 - I asked if you liked it, and you said no.\\
325 - There is a lot of room between "don't like" and "hate."     You know, it's-it's where you find rice pudding and jazz.\\
326 - Anyway, who cares what I think?\\
327 - I do.\\
328 - You're the-the coolest,     prettiest, best-dressed person in my life.\\
329 - Okay, that would be flattering,     except I know all the people in your life.\\
330 - Look, Amy,     I don't know what to say.\\
331 - I think I got stuck on the fact     that it's not a dress I would choose, but it shouldn't be.\\
332 - You know, it's your dress.\\
333 - I mean, hey, would you marry Leonard?\\
334 - Ew.\\
335 - Okay, a simple "no" would have been fine, but...\\
336 - you see my point.\\
337 - That we're different people?\\
338 - Yes, and from now on, I am gonna remember     that this wedding is all about you.\\
339 - I appreciate that.\\
340 - You're a good maid of honor.\\
341 - (ringtone plays)\\
342 - It's Bernadette.\\
343 - Hello?\\
344 - I feel bad about hanging Penny out to dry.\\
345 - The truth is, I don't like the dress, either.\\
346 - Are you kidding me?\\
347 - Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress?\\
348 - (whispers): Oh, she is the worst.\\
349 - Anyone seen Sheldon?\\
350 - Last time I saw Sheldon was this morning.\\
351 - Careful.\\
352 - Don't say his name a third time.\\
353 - You don't think he actually went to Las Vegas, do you?\\
354 - (roulette ball clicking)\\
355 - Five red.\\
356 - (slot machines chiming)\\
357 - This is it.\\
358 - - Is everything okay, sir?\\
359 - - Oh.\\
360 - Hi.\\
361 - It's better than okay.\\
362 - I am a physicist, and I have been observing this wheel     for hours and running a chi-square analysis,     which is how I know that the ball is far more likely     to land on   ,    or five.\\
363 - So if you could hold off on replacing this wheel,     I'd like to make several large bets.\\
364 - Well, good for you.\\
365 - Pelican.\\
366 - What's pelican?\\
367 - - Sir, would you come with us?\\
368 - - Oh, no.\\
369 - I have to place my bet first.\\
370 - This is for science.\\
371 - -    black.\\
372 - - No!\\
373 - No!\\
374 - Oh, guess who's no longer allowed to set foot in...?\\
375 - (gasps)\\
376 - Wow!\\
377 - You look beautiful.\\
378 - Really?\\
379 - 'Cause I was gonna return it.\\
380 - Why would you return it?\\
381 - You look like a pile of swans.\\
382 - I'm so glad you like it...\\
383 - because...\\
384 - it's gonna be my wedding dress.\\
385 - I can't wait to marry you.\\
386 - Why do you smell like smoke?\\
387 - I was in Vegas.\\
388 - Vegas?\\
389 - I'm sorry.\\
390 - Las Vegas.
\subsection {Episode 23: The Sibling Realignment}
1 - That's not right.\\
2 - That's so unreasonable.\\
3 - Yeah, well, if you're going to be like this,   then I don't want to talk to you right now, either.\\
4 - Okay.\\
5 - I love you.\\
6 - Bye.\\
7 - Amazon customer support?\\
8 - No, my mother.\\
9 - Guess who she's insisting we invite to our wedding.\\
10 - Jesus?\\
11 - If only.\\
12 - My brother.\\
13 - Wait a minute.\\
14 - You didn't invite your brother    to your own wedding?\\
15 - He tormented me my whole childhood.\\
16 - I don't think I should reward    that type of behavior    with a slice of wedding cake in the shape    of the Millennium Falcon.\\
17 - Try again.\\
18 - A slice of wedding cake in the shape of a cake.\\
19 - Look, he may have been mean to you when you were kids,    but you're both grown men now.\\
20 - That's right.\\
21 - I'm a grown-up,    and if I don't want to invite him to my wedding, then I won't.\\
22 - Okay.\\
23 - Except I have to 'cause my mommy's making me.\\
24 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
25 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!   \\
26 -  The Earth began to cool   \\
27 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
28 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids   \\
29 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery  \\
30 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
31 -  Bang!    \\
32 - Okay, so each welcome bag gets a schedule of events,    a map, and chocolate from me.\\
33 - And from Sheldon, a bottle of Purell...\\
34 - ...the number for Poison Control in case someone    accidentally drinks the Purell,    and a laminated    table of elements because the American school system    is a failure.\\
35 - How many out-of-town guests are there gonna be?\\
36 - I'm actually not sure.\\
37 - Turns out Sheldon didn't invite his brother.\\
38 - Mm.\\
39 - Now it's starting to sound like a wedding.\\
40 - And his mom said she won't come if his brother's not there.\\
41 - Ooh, now it's starting to sound like a good wedding.\\
42 - WOLOWITZ: Hey, Bernie.\\
43 - Hey.\\
44 - How do you know if someone has pink eye?\\
45 - Um, their eye would be red, swollen and probably oozy.\\
46 - Okay, thanks.\\
47 - Both kids have pink eye.\\
48 - Oh, no.\\
49 - You stop right there.\\
50 - I'm getting married in a week;    you are not giving me pink eye.\\
51 - I don't have pink eye.\\
52 - Hey!\\
53 - Hey.\\
54 - Hey.\\
55 - Step away from the bride.\\
56 - (chuckles): Okay.\\
57 - I'll go back upstairs.\\
58 - Get in the shower and then take those clothes and burn them.\\
59 - Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes!\\
60 - Ah, worth a shot.\\
61 - So am I gonna be, like, the only single guy at Sheldon's wedding?\\
62 - No.\\
63 - There-There'll be a lot of single people there.\\
64 - Stuart, Amy's great-aunt...\\
65 - Although, Stuart's already friended her on Facebook,    so, better move quick.\\
66 - I got to find a date.\\
67 - I don't want to be that sad single friend    that everyone looks at with pity.\\
68 - Uh, I'm-I'm afraid that ship may have sailed.\\
69 - Leonard,    you have a brother, right?\\
70 - Yes.\\
71 - Is he the worst?\\
72 - Is he an unspeakable abomination?\\
73 - Does the very thought of him make your skin crawl?\\
74 - Well, he laughs at his own jokes,    but otherwise he's okay.\\
75 - Sheldon, what's going on?\\
76 - I'm trying to invite my stupid brother to my wedding    and he's avoiding my calls.\\
77 - You don't know he's avoiding your calls.\\
78 - (line ringing)\\
79 - GEORGE JR.: Hey, you've reached George Cooper.\\
80 - Please leave a message, unless this is Sheldon again,    in which case, please try me on my other number,     -   -suck-it.\\
81 - See?\\
82 - And I know that's not a real number    because why would it be toll-free?\\
83 - Sheldon, you tried.\\
84 - What more could you have done?\\
85 - Hey, why didn't you invite him in the first place?\\
86 - You don't know what it was like growing up with him.\\
87 - I get it; I grew up with lots of brothers.\\
88 - My brother Adoot was especially mean.\\
89 - Really?\\
90 - I've never heard you mention Adoot.\\
91 - Yeah, sure I have.\\
92 - He's the one who left the door open when we were kids,     and my pet mongoose ran away.\\
93 - Stupid Adoot.\\
94 - Look, uh, short of getting on a plane and flying there,     what does your mother expect you to do?\\
95 - I kept saying no.\\
96 - H-H-How am I here?\\
97 - Hey, did I tell you?\\
98 - - I found a date.\\
99 - - To the wedding?\\
100 - Uh, to coffee.\\
101 - But if things go well, Sheldon and Amy's wedding.\\
102 - Aren't you worried it's a little intense     to ask someone you just met to go to a wedding?\\
103 - (sighs)\\
104 - I'm running out of time.\\
105 - Wh-Wh-Why can't there be a service where you can     just pay someone to be your date for the evening?\\
106 - Like an escort service?\\
107 - No, no, no.\\
108 - Y-You wouldn't be paying for s*x.\\
109 - I mean, obviously if things went well,     it could lead to s*x, but, but the money is for,     like, you know, her time and companionship.\\
110 - Oh, I get it...\\
111 - an escort service.\\
112 - Stop saying that.\\
113 - Stop meaning it.\\
114 - WOLOWITZ: Hey, Raj, remember when you borrowed     my VR goggles the other day?\\
115 - Yeah.\\
116 - (sighs)\\
117 - Probably shouldn't have done that.\\
118 - So, wait, y-your brother is Dr.\\
119 - Tire?\\
120 - Yes, and, apparently,     it only takes half a semester of community college     to get that particular doctorate.\\
121 - We passed three of these stores on the way here.\\
122 - Why did you say he's just "some loser who sells tires"?\\
123 - You're right, that was unfair.\\
124 - He's a loser who sells more tires     than anyone in Texas.\\
125 - Oh, excuse me.\\
126 - Uh, we're looking for a Georgie Cooper.\\
127 - One second, I'll check to see if the doctor's in.\\
128 - He is not a doctor.\\
129 - (scoffs)\\
130 - There's only one doctor here and it's me.\\
131 - I'm also a doctor.\\
132 - Do you want to wait in the car?\\
133 - I wanted to wait in California.\\
134 - So, is this Georgie?\\
135 - Yes.\\
136 - And what is he even using     that stethoscope to listen to?\\
137 - I don't know, small leak?\\
138 - All right, that makes sense.\\
139 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
140 - Hello, Georgie.\\
141 - It's just George now.\\
142 - Fine, George.\\
143 - No, I don't like it-- Georgie.\\
144 - I see you haven't changed one bit.\\
145 - Thank you, that is a nice thing to say.\\
146 - Hey, I'm Leonard.\\
147 - I'm here for-for no reason.\\
148 - What do you want, Sheldon?\\
149 - Why aren't you returning my phone calls?\\
150 - You're supposed to be the smart one;     you figure it out.\\
151 - He's not that kind of smart.\\
152 - You might want to give him a hint.\\
153 - We haven't talked     in over ten years, and now that you need something,     you think you can just show up at my store?\\
154 - Well, let's just drop everything     to accommodate Sheldon.\\
155 - Nice try,     but I am not a gullible little boy anymore.\\
156 - I can recognize sarcasm.\\
157 - Okay.\\
158 - You're right.\\
159 - I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.\\
160 - Tell me what you need.\\
161 - Your wish is my command.\\
162 - That's better, thank you.\\
163 - (Skype ringing)\\
164 - Oh, my God.\\
165 - Yeah, I got it, too.\\
166 - Wow.\\
167 - You really can't keep your hands off Howard, can you?\\
168 - I know, I have a problem.\\
169 - I just wanted to make sure you and Amy didn't get it.\\
170 - (quietly): Well, I didn't get it.\\
171 - You infected me a week before my wedding.\\
172 - What am I supposed to do about this?\\
173 - Wear a veil?\\
174 - (laughs)\\
175 - It's not funny.\\
176 - Look at what you've done to me!\\
177 - Ah, hey.\\
178 - Could you just, like, not touch my computer     or...\\
179 - like, anything else.\\
180 - I just, ugh,     I don't want to look like that in your wedding photos.\\
181 - There aren't gonna be any wedding photos.\\
182 - My fiancé's a germophobe.\\
183 - If he finds out I'm contagious,     he'll never come back from Texas.\\
184 - What if we tell him the theme of the wedding is Walking Dead     and this is our zombie makeup?\\
185 - That'll probably work.\\
186 - We'll call that plan B.\\
187 - Oh, well...\\
188 - (clears throat)\\
189 - Turns out this is gonna come in handy after all.\\
190 - Hold up.\\
191 - I-I'm confused.\\
192 - You didn't want me at your wedding,     but now that Mom won't come,     you want me there.\\
193 - I know you don't hear this a lot,     but that is exactly right.\\
194 - Good job.\\
195 - Not helping, Sheldon.\\
196 - Listen here,     you want me at your wedding,     all you got to do is ask nicely.\\
197 - (sighs)\\
198 - - Georgie.\\
199 - - George.\\
200 - (groans)\\
201 - I would like you at my wedding.\\
202 - Thank you, Sheldon.\\
203 - That is so nice to hear.\\
204 - But I would rather swallow a pregnant wildcat     and crap out a litter of kittens.\\
205 - It is fitting that you got into tires,     because you are tiresome.\\
206 - Sheldon, come on.\\
207 - Was that too mean?\\
208 - No, not too mean, not too good either.\\
209 - No, Mother.\\
210 - That's not fair.\\
211 - But he told...\\
212 - Yes, ma'am.\\
213 - But I said...\\
214 - Yes, ma'am.\\
215 - Good-bye.\\
216 - What'd she say?\\
217 - She's not getting in the middle of it because     we "boys need to work it out ourselves."     Oh, maybe it's fine if     she doesn't come to the wedding.\\
218 - I've got Amy now,     and she can do everything a mom can do and more.\\
219 - Say that to her on the wedding night.\\
220 - Really spice things up.\\
221 - This is all Georgie's fault.\\
222 - My whole childhood, he was mean to me.\\
223 - Sorry.\\
224 - I know what it's like to live with a bully.\\
225 - Your brother bullied you?\\
226 - Oh, I was talking about Penny, but sure, yeah.\\
227 - Once, when I was eight,     I was going to dress as my favorite scientist     for Halloween, and Georgie threw my costume away.\\
228 - I had to wear a sheet     and go as a ghost.\\
229 - Scared myself all night long.\\
230 - Well, look, we don't fly out until the morning.\\
231 - Why don't I try and talk to him, give it one more shot?\\
232 - All right.\\
233 - But if he says,     - "Nerd says what," don't answer him.\\
234 - - What?\\
235 - You are a lamb to the slaughter.\\
236 - So, how was your date?\\
237 - It was going well until my eye dripped in her latte.\\
238 - We're so sorry we ruined your date.\\
239 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
240 - His date got ruined.\\
241 - I'm about to get married, and look at me.\\
242 - It looks like it's getting better.\\
243 - Oh, does it?\\
244 - Does it look like that with your two clear eyes?\\
245 - I'm sorry.\\
246 - Are you mad that I don't have pink eye?\\
247 - What do you think?\\
248 - BOTH: Yes!\\
249 - Uh-huh.\\
250 - Okay.\\
251 - (knocking)\\
252 - Okay.\\
253 - Uh, uh, listen, I hear you.\\
254 - I know they're pricey, but these are the Dallas Cowboys     of tires, okay?\\
255 - And we're talking the Troy Aikman Cowboys,     not that pretty boy Tony Romo.\\
256 - All right.\\
257 - Good call.\\
258 - You won't regret it.\\
259 - Boom!\\
260 - (laughs)\\
261 - Wow.\\
262 - That was impressive.\\
263 - Yeah.\\
264 - Well, it's easy when you love your product     and hate Tony Romo.\\
265 - (laughs)\\
266 - Yeah, that guy's the...\\
267 - Actually, I don't, I don't know who that guy is.\\
268 - If you are here about Sheldon's wedding, don't bother.\\
269 - Come on.\\
270 - I-I know you two have your differences.\\
271 - You mean pretty much everything about us?\\
272 - Well, not everything.\\
273 - (laughs)\\
274 - You're both tall, you have the same last name.\\
275 - Maybe I shouldn't have started this like it was a list.\\
276 - You have no idea what you are talking about.\\
277 - Ooh, there-- that-that was very Sheldon.\\
278 - Look, I-I'm sure he was not the easiest brother to have,     but it wasn't easy for him either,     with you picking on him all the time.\\
279 - (laughing)\\
280 - Picking on him?\\
281 - Is that what he told you?\\
282 - Well, what about the time     you threw away his Halloween costume?\\
283 - Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna dress as some girl scientist.\\
284 - Madame Curie?\\
285 - Oh, I didn't know she was a madam.\\
286 - Come on.\\
287 - He was still gonna get beat up for wearing that dress.\\
288 - Well, didn't you sit on his head     while he tried to watch Star Trek?     Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.\\
289 - That is pretty hilarious, yeah.\\
290 - Look, I mean,     I always looked out for him at school.\\
291 - I drove him everywhere.\\
292 - I apologized to people when he was rude.\\
293 - Yeah.\\
294 - I've done all that.\\
295 - I've also removed all     the red balloons from his Lucky Charms     because they weren't "Irish enough." - All right.\\
296 - So you know what I'm talking about.\\
297 - And has he ever thanked you?\\
298 - Not in so many words,     or any words.\\
299 - Would it kill him to actually say it?\\
300 - No.\\
301 - No, it wouldn't kill him.\\
302 - Leonard,     you know how I got the money     to open up my first store?\\
303 - I busted my ass for it,     'cause all the extra money that we had had to go to Sheldon     so he could go to college and he could go     study in Germany.\\
304 - And do you know what he's never said to me?\\
305 - Danke schon?     It's, uh, "thank you" in German.\\
306 - Do you need me to sit on your head?\\
307 - Nope.\\
308 - After all my sacrifices,     guess which kid my mom is the most proud of.\\
309 - If it makes you feel any better,     my mom's most proud of Sheldon, too, so...\\
310 - Leonard,     you want a beer?\\
311 - Yeah, I would love a beer.\\
312 - There you go.\\
313 - Thanks.\\
314 - Can you open it for me?\\
315 - No, it's a twist-off.\\
316 - I know.\\
317 - Hey!\\
318 - I got all the beads to the other side.\\
319 - It's not a puzzle, Penny.\\
320 - Do you really want to be touching that?\\
321 - Do you know how many sick kids...?\\
322 - You know, never mind.\\
323 - Knock yourself out.\\
324 - (phone chimes)\\
325 - Bernadette says they're checking the kids now.\\
326 - You know, maybe we didn't all need to come.\\
327 - Hey, whatever kind of pink eye their kids have, I have,     and I need to know.\\
328 - And if it's viral, I'm screwed.\\
329 - Maybe not.\\
330 - You know, I know it's not traditional wedding attire,     but how about a welder's mask?\\
331 - KOOTHRAPPALI: If you know     a welder, that could be your "something borrowed."     (door opens)\\
332 - Great news!\\
333 - It's bacterial!\\
334 - - Yeah!\\
335 - - Yeah.\\
336 - - Yes!\\
337 - - Yeah.\\
338 - - Yes.\\
339 - (whooping)\\
340 - What are you doing?!\\
341 - Wash your hands!\\
342 - Oh.\\
343 - Not you.\\
344 - Hello.\\
345 - Room service?\\
346 - I'm calling about the club sandwich on your menu.\\
347 - No, I-I don't want one.\\
348 - I just want you to spell it correctly.\\
349 - Unless the "club" is the Poor Typing Club.\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - Now let's discuss this   % "gratooty"?\\
352 - Yeah-- well, that was rude.\\
353 - Someone just lost their gratooty.\\
354 - (sighs)\\
355 - Sheldon, you need to apologize to your brother.\\
356 - - I'm sorry?\\
357 - - Yes.\\
358 - Like that, but nicer, and that way.\\
359 - I have nothing to apologize for.\\
360 - (scoffs)\\
361 - I told you this was a bad idea.\\
362 - Sometimes you can't patch a tire.\\
363 - You just got to buy a new one.\\
364 - Actually, that's always the case.\\
365 - Never patch, buy new.\\
366 - While I appreciate your folksy tire wisdom,     I don't appreciate what you're putting Mom through.\\
367 - What would you know about what Mom's been through?\\
368 - You were never home.\\
369 - Yeah, this is good.\\
370 - - Get it all out.\\
371 - - Not now!\\
372 - - Shut up!\\
373 - You went away to college after Dad died.\\
374 - Who do you think took care of everything?\\
375 - Mom did.\\
376 - Mom always took care of everything.\\
377 - Mom was a mess, Missy was a dumb teenager.\\
378 - I had to look after both of 'em.\\
379 - I talked to Mom all the time.\\
380 - If she was upset, she would have told me.\\
381 - She was protecting you, you idiot,     just like everyone always does.\\
382 - If things were bad,     then why didn't you tell me?\\
383 - Because I was protecting you, too.\\
384 - (sighs)\\
385 - You're my baby brother, Sheldon.\\
386 - I know life has been hard for you,     but that don't mean it's been easy for the rest of us.\\
387 - I suppose I didn't think about how it was for everyone else.\\
388 - No, that's all right.\\
389 - I know you didn't.\\
390 - I'm sorry.\\
391 - Thank you.\\
392 - And it would mean a lot to me     to have my big brother at my wedding.\\
393 - I wouldn't miss it.\\
394 - (voice breaking): Is it me, or did we just patch a tire?\\
395 - He said, "Never patch." Do you even listen?\\
396 - (Skype ringing)\\
397 - Hey, how's it going?\\
398 - Really good.\\
399 - Georgie's going to come to the wedding.\\
400 - Oh, that's great!\\
401 - Why aren't you looking at the camera?\\
402 - Oh, you know, I'm just working on my peripheral vision.\\
403 - Well, that is nonsense.\\
404 - Your peripheral vision is fine.\\
405 - Are those women's magazines making you feel bad     about yourself again?\\
406 - Yup, that is what's happening.\\
407 - I have told you before, those women are airbrushed     to make it look like they have good vision.\\
408 - Hey, I-I was thinking,     now that you and your brother made up,     there's no reason to rush home.\\
409 - Maybe you and Leonard could,     could stay for, uh...\\
410 - two to three more fun-filled days there.\\
411 - That's a great idea!\\
412 - Hey, Leonard, good news.\\
413 - We do have time to visit the Museum of the American Railroad!\\
414 - I'd say no, but what's the point?\\
415 - Ooh.\\
416 - You might not want to get too close.\\
417 - Pink eye.\\
418 - Me, too!\\
419 - - Bacterial?\\
420 - - Yeah.\\
421 - Same!\\
422 - (laughs)\\
423 - I-I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...\\
424 - would you be interested in going to a wedding with me?
\subsection {Episode 24: The Bow Tie Asymmetry}
1 - All right, Saturday is the big day.\\
2 - A lot of people thought this would never come.\\
3 - I may have been one of those people.\\
4 - I may have been one of those people.\\
5 - Wait, wait, are we talking about the wedding?\\
6 - Yes.\\
7 - Oh, yeah, I was definitely one of those people.\\
8 - And yet, here we are.\\
9 - Now, we got a lot of family coming in tomorrow.\\
10 - I'm gonna need everyone's help.\\
11 - Think of this as one of your comic book movies.\\
12 - There's a bunch of superheroes, each with a different task.\\
13 - Oh, like the new Avengers.\\
14 - Which one was that?\\
15 - The one you slept through last weekend.\\
16 - Oh, that was a good nap.\\
17 - I-I think it's more like, uh, like Lord of the Rings,    and you're the Fellowship.\\
18 - Uh, someone's got to go to Gondor,    someone's got to go to Mordor,    someone's got to hold off the demon of shadow and flame.\\
19 - You mean the Balrog?\\
20 - I mean my mother.\\
21 - That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.\\
22 - Thank you.\\
23 - Because it also involves a ring    that binds me in servitude forever.\\
24 - Aw, he said forever.\\
25 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
26 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  \\
27 -  The Earth began to cool   \\
28 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
29 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids   \\
30 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
31 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
32 -  Bang!   \\
33 - That was Wil Wheaton.\\
34 - He's really excited about tomorrow.\\
35 - As am I.\\
36 - If you'd have told me as a child that an actor from Star Trek    would be officiating my wedding, I would've said,    "Ooh, William Shatner?"    And if you'd have said, "No, Wil "    And if you'd have said,    "Yes, but he costs too much money," I'd have said,    "Ah, well, Wil Wheaton's good, too."    Why do you keep tying and untying that bow tie?\\
37 - I can't seem to get it even.\\
38 - Well, I don't think it's supposed to be even.\\
39 - Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good.\\
40 - In the Renaissance, they called it "sprezzatura."    The Renaissance?\\
41 - Amy, you know I'm more of an Enlightenment person.\\
42 - At some point, we have to decide    how we want to raise the children.\\
43 - So are you feeling okay?\\
44 - No wedding jitters?\\
45 - No.\\
46 - There is nothing in the world    that would stop me from marrying you tomorrow,    even me from the future coming back to prevent the wedding    and the subsequent birth of a child who will destroy humanity.\\
47 - Because if you came from the future,    that would mean you already went through with the wedding    because you believe that time travel is on a closed loop.\\
48 - I love you so damn much.\\
49 - (sighs)\\
50 - Uh, Mr.\\
51 - Fowler, are you okay back there?\\
52 - Do you need more air?\\
53 - He's fine.\\
54 - I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.\\
55 - Oh, well, you know,    she's pretty busy the day before her wedding.\\
56 - Too busy for her mother?\\
57 - She used to be such a devoted daughter.\\
58 - Now she's just waiting for me to die so she can get my china.\\
59 - Thank you again for picking us up.\\
60 - (chuckles)\\
61 - My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.\\
62 - You know, our driver to the airport    was also a Indian fella.\\
63 - Mom...\\
64 - Oh, so now it's racist to notice when somebody's Indian.\\
65 - I don't think it's racist.\\
66 - I noticed you were both white.\\
67 - See?\\
68 - You'll have to excuse her.\\
69 - She's just pregnant and hormonal.\\
70 - Oh, yeah, congratulations on baby number two.\\
71 - Yeah.\\
72 - Whoopie.\\
73 - Her husband would be here,    but he stayed home to watch their older son,    so e-everything's fine!\\
74 - Stop it.\\
75 - We're separated.\\
76 - You don't say.\\
77 - So, you're Sheldon's big brother.\\
78 - Uh, yeah.\\
79 - He got the brains.\\
80 - I got the bod.\\
81 - (chuckles)\\
82 - And the face and the hair.\\
83 - I like your accent.\\
84 - Sheldon, did you used to sound like that?\\
85 - Can you still?\\
86 - I can.\\
87 - I will not.\\
88 - Amy, you said something about my bow tie     that I can't stop thinking about.\\
89 - Don't you mean...\\
90 - (Southern accent): "Y'all said something 'bout my bow tie"?\\
91 - Go on, say it.\\
92 - (chuckles)\\
93 - Say it.\\
94 - Hey, guys, look who I have.\\
95 - Oh.\\
96 - MISSY: Hey.\\
97 - Hey, Shelly.\\
98 - I'm so glad you made it, Missy.\\
99 - This is my fiancée, Amy.\\
100 - Amy, this is my sister.\\
101 - If I ever need a kidney, this is where you get it.\\
102 - - It's so nice to meet you.\\
103 - - ‭Aw.\\
104 - I've always wanted a sister.\\
105 - Really?\\
106 - Why?\\
107 - I love you, too, Sheldon.\\
108 - Really?\\
109 - Why?\\
110 - Where's Mom?\\
111 - Uh, she wanted to stop by the hotel and freshen up,     and then call her pastor to pray for Missy's soul.\\
112 - Oh, my God.\\
113 - There's mama's girl.\\
114 - - Hi, Mom.\\
115 - - ‭Oh!\\
116 - Oh, Larry, look at her!\\
117 - Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married?\\
118 - He can't believe it.\\
119 - And neither can I.\\
120 - (laughs)\\
121 - Hi, Dad.\\
122 - How you doing?\\
123 - What the hell is that?\\
124 - Come on, you know this one.\\
125 - It's a...\\
126 - dog.\\
127 - I found him in the backyard.\\
128 - And don't worry, I already called the owner.\\
129 - Good, 'cause we don't need a dog.\\
130 - We already have two babies, you and Stuart.\\
131 - (doorbell rings)\\
132 - That's probably him.\\
133 - Hi.\\
134 - I'm gonna need a minute.\\
135 - That's Mark Hamill!\\
136 - Hello.\\
137 - Thank you so much for finding this guy.\\
138 - Oh, my goodness.\\
139 - Hey, Bark.\\
140 - How are you, buddy?\\
141 - Y-Your dog's name is Bark?\\
142 - Yeah.\\
143 - Bark Hamill?\\
144 - Yeah.\\
145 - Well, I let the fans name him online.\\
146 - I got lucky, though.\\
147 - He was almost Honey Baked Hamill.\\
148 - Anyway, thanks so much.\\
149 - I-I want to give you a reward for finding him.\\
150 - (chuckles): Oh, no, I couldn't take your money.\\
151 - It's just an honor to meet you.\\
152 - No.\\
153 - No, please.\\
154 - You don't know what this dog means to me,     and I thought he was gone for good.\\
155 - Please?\\
156 - There must be something I can do for you.\\
157 - Anything.\\
158 - Oh, you're gonna regret that.\\
159 - (chuckles)\\
160 - Hey, dude.\\
161 - Dude?\\
162 - Yeah, you know, just want you to know     that I don't think of you as a woman.\\
163 - Oh, perfect.\\
164 - I don't think of you as a man.\\
165 - Great.\\
166 - So, as two genderless blobs of human flesh,     how would you like to go     to Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me?\\
167 - Oh, Stuart.\\
168 - Look, I appreciate that, but it just might be     a little weird, considering you're my boss.\\
169 - Guess who's gonna officiate Sheldon and Amy's wedding!\\
170 - Mark Hamill!\\
171 - Luke Skywalker is gonna be at the wedding!\\
172 - You'll need to buy me a dress.\\
173 - And did you know that my Amy     played Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?\\
174 - Amy, you never said you were in a school play.\\
175 - Oh, no, no, at home.\\
176 - I'd never let her do a school play.\\
177 - Those kids just take drugs and have intercourse.\\
178 - You know, Amy still does some performing.\\
179 - She and Sheldon do an Internet show about flags.\\
180 - Amy?\\
181 - V-Videos on the Internet?\\
182 - You know what men use those for.\\
183 - If you're talking about Fun with Flags,     I use it to go to sleep.\\
184 - Sheldon, you're awfully quiet.\\
185 - Are you okay?\\
186 - Oh.\\
187 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
188 - I was thinking about string theory.\\
189 - But catch me up.\\
190 - What'd I miss?\\
191 - Are you seeing this, Larry?\\
192 - These are the people I'm gonna have to live with     after you're dead.\\
193 - Welcome, Bert.\\
194 - Don't you look nice.\\
195 - Yeah.\\
196 - Like a geode, I clean up good.\\
197 - Don't you crack a geode open?\\
198 - It's not a perfect metaphor.\\
199 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, my God.\\
200 - - Is that Mark Hamill?\\
201 - - ‭Yeah.\\
202 - BERT: Oh, my God.\\
203 - - Is that...\\
204 - - Bert, go find your seat!\\
205 - W-What is he doing here?\\
206 - I found his dog     and guilted him into officiating the wedding.\\
207 - Don't tell Sheldon.\\
208 - It's a surprise.\\
209 - Wait, I-I thought Wil was officiating the wedding.\\
210 - Yeah, so did he.\\
211 - How did he take the news?\\
212 - I'll let you know.\\
213 - Hey, Wil!\\
214 - (sniffles)\\
215 - Are you having an allergic reaction to my boutonniere?\\
216 - No.\\
217 - I'm just so happy for you.\\
218 - And for me.\\
219 - After today, you are officially--     and, more important, legally-- Amy's problem.\\
220 - Don't be silly, Leonard.\\
221 - I will always be your problem.\\
222 - (knocking)\\
223 - Hey, baby.\\
224 - Hello, Mother.\\
225 - Leonard, could you give us a moment?\\
226 - Oh, of course.\\
227 - Oh, Shelly.\\
228 - I wish your dad could see you now.\\
229 - Me, too.\\
230 - I miss him.\\
231 - He would be so proud of you.\\
232 - I know that I am.\\
233 - Thank you.\\
234 - I mean, for everything.\\
235 - My whole life.\\
236 - Oh.\\
237 - (chuckles)\\
238 - (sniffles)\\
239 - Let me straighten your tie.\\
240 - No, no, no, it's all right.\\
241 - It's supposed to be a little asymmetrical.\\
242 - Apparently, a small flaw somehow improves it.\\
243 - I can see that.\\
244 - Sometimes it's the...\\
245 - imperfect stuff that makes things perfect.\\
246 - Excuse me.\\
247 - (door closes)\\
248 - Case in point.\\
249 - So, we finally meet.\\
250 - I'm sorry, who are you?\\
251 - (scoffs)\\
252 - I'm Wil Wheaton.\\
253 - I was supposed to officiate this wedding.\\
254 - I was up all night preparing these notes.\\
255 - Well, thanks so much.\\
256 - It's gonna be a great help.\\
257 - (knocking)\\
258 - SHELDON: Amy.\\
259 - (knocking)\\
260 - Amy.\\
261 - (knocking)\\
262 - Amy.\\
263 - Come in.\\
264 - (panting)\\
265 - There's something I need to tell you.\\
266 - Wow, you look amazing!\\
267 - That's not what I need to tell you.\\
268 - But you do!\\
269 - What's wrong?\\
270 - Something incredible just happened.\\
271 - Remember when you were telling me about my bow tie     and how a little asymmetry is good?\\
272 - - Yeah?\\
273 - - My equations have been trying     to describe an imperfect world,     and the only way to do that is to introduce imperfection     into the underlying theory.\\
274 - So, instead of supersymmetry,     it would be super asymmetry?\\
275 - (gasps)\\
276 - Super asymmetry.\\
277 - That's it!\\
278 - - Give me your lipstick.\\
279 - - What?\\
280 - Just give it to me, you beautiful thing!\\
281 - We have work to do!\\
282 - Hey, uh, the bride and groom     seem to be running a little behind.\\
283 - Do you think you could stall?\\
284 - Stall?\\
285 - How?\\
286 - Hey, everybody!\\
287 - Uh, it's gonna be a few more minutes, but while we wait,     does anyone have any questions about Star Wars?\\
288 - You got this.\\
289 - So if I make slightly asymmetric knots     with sheets in four dimensions,     I can bootstrap the whole idea     to a large asymmetry in    dimensions.\\
290 - Maybe even at the initial moment of creation,     the fundamental forces lacked symmetry.\\
291 - (knocking)\\
292 - Everyone's waiting.\\
293 - What are you guys doing?\\
294 - Super asymmetry.\\
295 - Super asymmetry?\\
296 - Is that a thing?\\
297 - We're inventing it right now.\\
298 - Don't you think this can wait until...\\
299 - Hold on.\\
300 - This is interesting.\\
301 - So, yeah, Mr.\\
302 - Mark?\\
303 - When you were on the, uh, Wookiee home planet,     how did you even understand what they were saying?\\
304 - I don't remember ever being on a Wookiee home planet.\\
305 - Uh, actually, Luke was on the Wookiee home planet,     Kashyyyk, in the Holiday Special     when he helped Chewie get home to his wife.\\
306 - Chewie had a wife?\\
307 - Her name's Malla.\\
308 - Wow, that's impressive.\\
309 - Yeah.\\
310 - Hey, uh, I got a question.\\
311 - Why aren't there tires on any of those Star Wars vehicles?\\
312 - (chuckles)\\
313 - I'm sure some of them had tires.\\
314 - Actually, they don't.\\
315 - I mean, the HAVw A  turbo tank has metal gripping wheels,     but I wouldn't call them tires.\\
316 - You are so hot.\\
317 - This is taking too long.\\
318 - I bet that Sheldon stood my baby up.\\
319 - Uh, excuse me.\\
320 - Where-where are you going?\\
321 - This whole thing was a big mistake.\\
322 - I'm gonna find Amy     and get her out of here.\\
323 - - ‭Sit down!\\
324 - Excuse me?\\
325 - Sheldon loves Amy,     and he would never hurt her on her wedding day     or any other day, so park it.\\
326 - Oh, you sit down, too.\\
327 - Are you gonna let her talk to me like that?\\
328 - Say something.\\
329 - Thank you.\\
330 - LEONARD: Uh, according to Google, there are     zero papers that mention super asymmetry.\\
331 - This is brand-new.\\
332 - No one's thought of it.\\
333 - What are you lunatics doing?\\
334 - !\\
335 - Sheldon had a breakthrough.\\
336 - Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.\\
337 - Oh, science?\\
338 - Shocking!\\
339 - You don't understand.\\
340 - This could be really big.\\
341 - No, Penny's right.\\
342 - We have our whole lives to do science together.\\
343 - Let's get married.\\
344 - PENNY: All right.\\
345 - It's go time!\\
346 - I am pumped!\\
347 - Okay, everyone.\\
348 - Here we go.\\
349 - Leonard.\\
350 - That's Mark Ha-Ha-Ha...\\
351 - It's-it's Mark Hami-Ha-Ha...\\
352 - Yep.\\
353 - Thank Wolowitz.\\
354 - He set it up.\\
355 - (whispers): Thank you.\\
356 - Congratulations on your wedding.\\
357 - Thank you.\\
358 - When this is over, I have  ,    things for you to sign.\\
359 - ("Bridal Chorus" playing)\\
360 - Thank you, Daddy.\\
361 - (song ends)\\
362 - I-I thought Wil was marrying us.\\
363 - Wolowitz got us an upgrade.\\
364 - Another sci-fi guy with a beard.\\
365 - Seems lateral, but okay.\\
366 - Welcome.\\
367 - We are gathered here today     in the sight of family, friends and Almighty God.\\
368 - That's too religious.\\
369 - That lady over there made me say it.\\
370 - He heard you, and he can't un-hear you.\\
371 - We're here to celebrate the marriage     of Sheldon Lee Cooper...\\
372 - ...and Amy Farrah Fowler.\\
373 - I had more prepared,     but I'm just gonna skip to the rings and vows,     since I've been answering your questions for    minutes.\\
374 - Yeah, he answered 'em.\\
375 - Amy, you're up.\\
376 - Sheldon, when I was a little girl,     I used to dream about my wedding.\\
377 - But, eventually, I stopped,     because I thought that day would never come.\\
378 - And then I met you.\\
379 - From the first moment in that coffee shop,     I knew that there was something special between us,     even though I did work on a study     that disproved love at first sight.\\
380 - I loved that study the moment I read it.\\
381 - Ironic, huh?\\
382 - Clearly, it was wrong.\\
383 - Because I felt something that day,     and those feelings have only gotten stronger with time.\\
384 - I can't imagine loving you more than I do right now.\\
385 - But I felt that way yesterday and the day before yesterday     and the day before that.\\
386 - Is that growth linear or accelerating?\\
387 - Accelerating.\\
388 - Oh, maybe we could graph it out.\\
389 - Save something for the honeymoon.\\
390 - Smart.\\
391 - Sheldon,     I don't know what the future holds,     but I know that I've never been happier than I am     in this moment marrying you.\\
392 - (voice breaking): Well, that was unexpectedly beautiful.\\
393 - (sniffles)\\
394 - I might need a minute.\\
395 - Amy...\\
396 - ...I usually know exactly what to say.\\
397 - But in this moment...\\
398 - I have no words.\\
399 - I guess...\\
400 - (sighs softly)\\
401 - I'm overwhelmed by you.\\
402 - In a good way.\\
403 - Not in the elevator in the Haunted Mansion way.\\
404 - Even if I can't tell you now how I feel,     I will spend my life showing you how much I love you.\\
405 - (voice breaking): Do you...\\
406 - (clears throat)\\
407 - Do you...\\
408 - Hey, I'm just saying, I'm here if you need me to step in.\\
409 - No, no, no.\\
410 - I got this.\\
411 - (sniffles)\\
412 - Amy, do you take Sheldon for your lawful wedded husband?\\
413 - I do.\\
414 - (high-pitched): And, Sheldon, same thing.\\
415 - I do.\\
416 - Then by the power vested in me     by EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...\\
417 - ...I now pronounce you husband and wife.\\
418 - You may kiss the bride.\\
419 - (crowd cheering)\\
420 -  At wast...\\
421 -    \\
422 -  My wove has come awong    \\
423 -  My wonewy days are over   \\
424 -  And wife is wike a song   \\
425 -  Oh, yeah.

1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Can you believe our little lamb is finally getting married?\\
3 - He can't believe it.\\
4 - And neither can I.\\
5 -  (laughing)  Hi, Dad.\\
6 - How you doing?\\
7 -  (voice breaking) : Then by the power vested in me...   by EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com... \\
8 - I now pronounce you husband and wife.\\
9 - You may kiss the bride.\\
10 -  (crowd cheering)     Good morning, wife.\\
11 -  (chuckles)     Good morning, husband.\\
12 - I can't believe we're actually married.\\
13 - It's official.\\
14 - According to tradition,    we should hang the bedsheets outside    so the villagers can see that we consummated.\\
15 - I don't think that that's appropriate,    considering where we're starting our honeymoon.\\
16 - Well, I suppose you're right.\\
17 - Although, when you think about it,    Lego is the perfect metaphor for marital congress.\\
18 - Two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap.\\
19 - Oh, that's the sound you were making.\\
20 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
21 - While you were sleeping, I ordered room service.\\
22 - Really?\\
23 - Voilà!\\
24 - You thought it was going to be food, didn't you?\\
25 -   Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
26 - Wait!\\
27 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      Is it nice having Sheldon and Amy away on their honeymoon?\\
28 - Yeah, because now Leonard and I get all this alone time.\\
29 - But you're not alone.\\
30 - We're here.\\
31 - Yes.\\
32 -  (sighs)  Yes, you are.\\
33 -  BERNADETTE:  Would you like us to leave so you and Leonard can talk about    all the things you have in common?\\
34 -  LEONARD:  Ha, ha, she called your bluff.\\
35 -  KOOTHRAPPALI:  So, something pretty cool happened.\\
36 - Channel   asked me to be on the news tomorrow night    to talk about the meteor shower.\\
37 - - Oh, that's great.\\
38 - - Hey!\\
39 - - Congratulations.\\
40 - You know, that's how Neil deGrasse Tyson got his start.\\
41 - He went from the Hayden Planetarium    to guesting on the local news    to ruining everyone's favorite movies on the Internet.\\
42 -  KOOTHRAPPALI:  Now it's happening to me.\\
43 - Ooh, I should probably make a list    of all the scientific inaccuracies in Mamma Mia.    You're gonna go on live TV and admit you've seen that movie?\\
44 - Hey, your husband's the one who took me.\\
45 - Meryl Streep and Cher?\\
46 - Yeah, I saw it.\\
47 -  (loud noise)     Sounds like someone's in there.\\
48 - My God, what if Sheldon and Amy are getting robbed?\\
49 - Or worse, what if they're back early?\\
50 - They're not; they just posted a picture    in front of the Statue of Liberty.\\
51 - - Real or Lego?\\
52 - -Lego.\\
53 - So, what should we do?\\
54 - Should someone go check it out?\\
55 - I would, but I got to be on TV tomorrow.\\
56 - Got to protect the money.\\
57 - Oh, yeah, someone's definitely in there.\\
58 - Okay, let's go into our apartment.\\
59 - We'll lock the door, we'll call the pol...\\
60 - Hello?!\\
61 - Anyone in there?!\\
62 - - Yes?\\
63 - - Oh, uh, Mr.\\
64 - Fowler.\\
65 - Sorry, we didn't know you were here.\\
66 - We-we actually thought someone was breaking in.\\
67 -  (chuckles)     And we were ready to take them down.\\
68 - Amy asked me to water her plants.\\
69 - She doesn't have any plants.\\
70 - Oh.\\
71 - Well, you caught me in a lie.\\
72 - Have a good day.\\
73 - That was weird, right?\\
74 - Was it?\\
75 - I-I honestly can't tell anymore.\\
76 - Hey, did you even see Mamma Mia  ?    Didn't need to.\\
77 - The sequel stands on its own.\\
78 - Here you go.\\
79 - If you need any recommendations while visiting New York,    please don't hesitate to contact me.\\
80 - Well, it is our honeymoon.\\
81 - So we are going to be quite busy.\\
82 - Got it.\\
83 - Harry Potter play, parts one and two.\\
84 - And tomorrow, a tour of the sites    where Nikola Tesla lived, worked and slowly went crazy.\\
85 - And, of course, coitus.\\
86 - Ah.\\
87 - Well, enjoy New York.\\
88 - And, I guess, coitus.\\
89 -  Really, Sheldon?\\
90 -  You want to do it again?\\
91 -  Don't act surprised.\\
92 -  It's clearly marked on the schedule.\\
93 -  Now,     shall we steam the wrinkles out of our wizard robes,     or make vigorous, socially sanctioned love?\\
94 -  Either way, I can check something off my to-do list.\\
95 -  Socially sanc-- Oh, wow.\\
96 - Yeah, there it is right there.\\
97 -  Uh, hurry.\\
98 - Raj is on next.\\
99 -  All right.\\
100 - I can't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries     but they'll show this.\\
101 -  This is the news.\\
102 -  And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires.\\
103 -  What is your point?\\
104 -   (pounding on door across hall)  \\
105 - MRS. FOWLER:  Larry?\\
106 - I know you're in there!\\
107 -  Is that Amy's mom?\\

\subsection {Episode 02: The Wedding Gift Wormhole}
1 - But I think, by the end of the honeymoon,     we really started to feel like a married couple.\\
2 - But the good kind, like on TV,     not like my parents.\\
3 - - Yeah.\\
4 - You're not a real married couple until you can pee     with the door open and she's okay with it.\\
5 - I told you, I'm not okay with it.\\
6 - She loves it.\\
7 - So, we got everybody gifts.\\
8 - Aw.\\
9 - Did you forget about us      until you were at the airport?\\
10 - No.\\
11 - We forgot about you until we were on the plane.\\
12 - Luckily, there was Wi-Fi,      and I have Amazon Prime.\\
13 - I heart New York.\\
14 - Aw, the baby's gonna love throwing up on this.\\
15 - Look, it doesn't have to just be New York.\\
16 - That's the beauty of it.\\
17 - Uh, the initials "N.Y." can stand for anything you like.\\
18 - For instance, I understand that there is      an elderly rock-and-roll musician named Neil Young.\\
19 - Perhaps you heart him.\\
20 - Or if not him, Egyptian table tennis silver medalist      Noha Yossry.\\
21 - Or Nana Yamaguchi,      the Japanese voice actress      who starred in Sally the Witch.      Did you just Google the initials "N.Y."?\\
22 - I had Wi-Fi and a long plane flight.\\
23 - Draw your own conclusions.\\
24 - Well, guys, that was very, very thoughtful of you.\\
25 - I...\\
26 - Did you get me a double XL?\\
27 - - I told you.\\
28 - - You were right, dear.\\
29 -   Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state        Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
30 - Wait!\\
31 -        The Earth began to cool        The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools        We built the Wall   We built the pyramids        Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery        That all started with a big bang        Bang!          Sheldon, that's not how you write a thank you card.\\
32 - What's wrong with it?\\
33 - "Dear Aunt Helen,      "thank you so much for the lovely place setting.\\
34 - "If my handwriting looks strained,      "that is because this is the   th thank you card      "Amy has forced me to write.\\
35 - "The muscles in my wrist are cramping      "as I struggle to finish this sentence.\\
36 - "Ow, ow, oh, the pain.\\
37 - Love, Sheldon."      Fine.\\
38 - "And Amy."      Ow.\\
39 - This one is from Leonard and Penny.\\
40 - Aw.\\
41 - "The perfect gift for the perfect couple."      Save that card.\\
42 - We may need to throw it back in their faces.\\
43 - I wonder what it could be.\\
44 - Oh, could be anything.\\
45 - A flute, a letter opener,      one of those pens      where you put the bikini back on the naked lady.\\
46 - Oh.\\
47 - Isn't this nice?\\
48 - What is it?\\
49 - You know, it's, uh,      it's one of those...\\
50 - Nope, doesn't do that.\\
51 - Oh, maybe it's candy.\\
52 - Lick it.\\
53 - I don't want to lick it.\\
54 - You lick it.\\
55 - I'm not gonna lick it.\\
56 - I just brushed my teeth.\\
57 - Is it from one of your dumb sci-fi shows?\\
58 - Uh, none of the sci-fi shows I watch are dumb.\\
59 - - Sheldon...\\
60 - - Okay, Westworld.      But this has nothing to do with that show,      other than it's also inexplicable.\\
61 - Well, Leonard and Penny are our best friends.\\
62 - They know us better than anyone.\\
63 - They said it's the perfect gift.\\
64 - We must be missing something.\\
65 - You don't...\\
66 - think it's a marital aid, do you?\\
67 - Don't be silly.\\
68 - Amy, how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage?\\
69 - Do you think when Krypto the Superdog      is out flying, Superman has to fly after him      with a little baggie?\\
70 - Hmm.\\
71 - Haven't really thought about it before.\\
72 - But he doesn't need a baggie,      because he just blasts the poop with his heat vision.\\
73 - You've thought about it before.\\
74 - Oh, I've thought about it a lot.\\
75 - (chuckles)\\
76 - (chuckles)\\
77 - What is wrong with Stuart's face?\\
78 - I think he's smiling.\\
79 - Oh, my God, are they flirting?\\
80 - Oh, they're way past flirting.\\
81 - I caught them making out at Sheldon's wedding.\\
82 - Are you sure she wasn't trying to breathe life back into him?\\
83 - I don't think so.\\
84 - When I used that much tongue at CPR training,       I had to buy the dummy.\\
85 - Ooh, I have class.\\
86 - I should go.\\
87 - Oh.\\
88 - Okay.\\
89 - - Bye.\\
90 - - Bye.\\
91 - (chuckles)\\
92 - (both chuckle)\\
93 - See ya, guys.\\
94 - - Bye.\\
95 - - Bye.\\
96 - So, what's her deal?\\
97 - Is she into you or does she just hate her parents?\\
98 - I-I don't know.\\
99 - We kissed a little at the wedding,       and it was great.\\
100 - But we haven't really talked about it since then.\\
101 - So I-I don't know how she feels about me.\\
102 - Well, she patted you on the head,       so I'm guessing she feels like you're such a good boy!\\
103 - (chuckles)\\
104 - Seriously, do you think I should ask her out?\\
105 - A-Absolutely.\\
106 - Don't let love get away.\\
107 - It is the most important thing in the world.\\
108 - Without it, life is       dark and meaningless and all you're left with       is the judgmental gaze of your dog       as you finish off a bag of Doritos on the toilet.\\
109 - Thanks.\\
110 - You're a real good pal.\\
111 - And now you're a good boy!\\
112 - (smooches)\\
113 - I can't stop thinking about that present.\\
114 - It's driving me crazy.\\
115 - Me, too!\\
116 - The card said it was the perfect gift.\\
117 - But it's not a dinosaur fossil or matching pocket watches,       so I don't see how it can be.\\
118 - Maybe we're trying too hard.\\
119 - Maybe it's something simple.\\
120 - (gasps)\\
121 - Like Leonard and Penny.\\
122 - Yes, good.\\
123 - We just need to think like them.\\
124 - (inhales, exhales)\\
125 - Okay.\\
126 - What gift can I get us       to express how grateful we are to have us in their lives?\\
127 - Way to make it simple.\\
128 - I'm just gonna ask them.\\
129 - No, you can't; it'll hurt their feelings.\\
130 - I'm okay with that.\\
131 - And they'll know you weren't smart enough       to figure it out on your own.\\
132 - You're right.\\
133 - Oh, this is awful.\\
134 - And I can't even comfort myself by stroking       the fossilized tibia of a Pentaceratops.       Let's just go to sleep.\\
135 - We'll look at it in the morning with fresh eyes,       and maybe it'll come to us.\\
136 - Fine.\\
137 - Or we go tear apart that box and look for a clue.\\
138 - Staying up past my bedtime and solving mysteries?\\
139 - Who knew married life could be this good?\\
140 - What's wrong with his face?\\
141 - A lot of people have been asking that.\\
142 - He's...\\
143 - smiling.\\
144 - Hey, Stuart, you look pretty happy.\\
145 - Oh, yeah.\\
146 - I, uh, asked Denise out on a date,       and she said yes.\\
147 - Aw.\\
148 - That's great.\\
149 - But don't smile like that in front of Halley.\\
150 - She just started sleeping through the night.\\
151 - Sorry.\\
152 - I'm excited.\\
153 - I haven't been on a date in a long time.\\
154 - Back when I was dating, I'd always wear       a new pair of underwear, just in case.\\
155 - It's also been a long time since I bought new underwear.\\
156 - And I probably should,       because these are no longer tighty nor whitey.\\
157 - Okay, I'm out.\\
158 - If there's a chance someone's gonna see you naked,       it's also polite to make sure you're well-groomed down there.\\
159 - I get it, Howard.\\
160 - I've been busy!\\
161 - Hello.\\
162 - - Hey.\\
163 - - I just wanted       to pop over and hand-deliver this thank you note       for your very thoughtful wedding gift.\\
164 - PENNY: Oh.\\
165 - Oh, good.\\
166 - You guys liked it?\\
167 - Well, we liked it a lot more than things that aren't it,       I'll tell you that.\\
168 - Well, yeah, that's great.\\
169 - Because when we saw it, we thought, "Amy and Sheldon       just have to have that."       Oh, do tell.\\
170 - Now, paint a picture for me,       like where you were when you found it       and what you thought we'd enjoy doing with it.\\
171 - Do you not know what it is?\\
172 - PENNY: Of course he knows       what it is.\\
173 - He's the smartest man in the world.\\
174 - Well, I don't know about the world.\\
175 - Some of those Chinese fellas are pretty clever.\\
176 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going       to return home and use your gift       in the manner which it was intended.\\
177 - (laughing)\\
178 - He-He's never gonna figure it out.\\
179 - I know.\\
180 - (thumping)\\
181 - SHELDON: What are you?!\\
182 - - Gosh, this makes me happy.\\
183 - - Yeah.\\
184 - (laughs)\\
185 - Howard, I don't often say this,       but, good, you're here.\\
186 - Now,       do you know       what Leonard and Penny got us for our wedding gift?\\
187 - - Well...\\
188 - - (stammers)\\
189 - Don't answer.\\
190 - I don't want to know.\\
191 - I just want to know if you know.\\
192 - - I do know.\\
193 - - Okay, great.\\
194 - I believe that Amy and I have figured it out.\\
195 - Is it a clue to a scavenger hunt       that will lead us to the actual present?\\
196 - If you're asking       if you and Amy should spend the next couple days       running all over town searching for the next clue,       I'm gonna have to say yes.\\
197 - I knew it!\\
198 - This is so much fun.\\
199 - Oh, it really is.\\
200 - (chuckles)\\
201 - Oh, Leonard, thank you again.\\
202 - - We love the gift.\\
203 - - Aw.\\
204 - Does he know what it is?\\
205 - No, not even close.\\
206 - He thinks it's a clue to a scavenger hunt.\\
207 - (laughs)\\
208 - So, so happy.\\
209 - Well, what is it?\\
210 - What did you give them?\\
211 - Oh, i-it's just this dumb crystal wand       that Howard and Bernadette gave us for our wedding.\\
212 - Penny and I made each other miserable       trying to figure out what it was, and we thought,       "Why not pass that fun along to Sheldon and Amy."       Wait a minute.\\
213 - Did--       did you give them the crystal chakra wand       that I gave you for your wedding?\\
214 - Yeah, that's exactly what we did.\\
215 - You said you liked it!\\
216 - Yeah, that's exactly what I said.\\
217 - Wow.\\
218 - A scavenger hunt.\\
219 - That's exciting.\\
220 - I had a bit of a scavenger hunt myself last night.\\
221 - I was trying to find the remote.\\
222 - I looked under one of the cushions.\\
223 - Wasn't there.\\
224 - Then I lifted the cushion a little higher.\\
225 - Bingo.\\
226 - Riveting.\\
227 - So, do you know what it is?\\
228 - Of course I know what it is.\\
229 - It's a silicon dioxide crystal, otherwise known as quartz.\\
230 - Are you sure?\\
231 - Am I sure?\\
232 - Is basalt a mafic extrusive igneous rock formed       by the rapid cooling of magnesium and iron-rich lava?\\
233 - Yeah, I'm sure.\\
234 - Okay, so it's quartz.\\
235 - That's got to mean something.\\
236 - What do we know about quartz?\\
237 - I'll Google it.\\
238 - Or you can ask me, the geologist       who won the MacArthur Genius Grant.\\
239 - Got it!\\
240 - Quartz, from the German "quarz"       which sounds the same, but is spelled without a "T".\\
241 - Interesting.\\
242 - No "T".\\
243 - What is not "T"?\\
244 - Coffee!\\
245 - The coffee shop where we first met!\\
246 - All right, let's go.\\
247 - Sorry.\\
248 - I think I just had an adrenaline rush from having visitors.\\
249 - Hey, Raj, will you, um, smell something for me?\\
250 - Uh, that depends.\\
251 - Actually, it doesn't depend.\\
252 - Just no.\\
253 - I'm trying out some new colognes for my date with Denise.\\
254 - Oh, and you just came over here       to rub it in my face that you have a date?\\
255 - No.\\
256 - I came over here because I need advice,       and you've gone out with more women than anybody I know.\\
257 - Huh.\\
258 - I guess you're right.\\
259 - Sheldon's the smart one, Howard's the funny one,       and apparently, I'm the ladies' man.\\
260 - Which one's Leonard?\\
261 - Oh, yeah, right.\\
262 - I guess Leonard's the forgettable one.\\
263 - Okay, let's have a whiff.\\
264 - Oh.\\
265 - (sniffs)\\
266 - Hmm.\\
267 - Smells like Paco Rabanne.\\
268 - Ooh, you're good.\\
269 - I bought it at a swap meet.\\
270 - It's actually called "Smells Like Paco Rabanne."       It's great.\\
271 - She's gonna love it.\\
272 - I hope so.\\
273 - I really like Denise, and I don't want to screw this up.\\
274 - Hey, relax.\\
275 - Trust your instincts.\\
276 - That's what I do.\\
277 - And that works for you?\\
278 - Actually...\\
279 - no.\\
280 - I've made a mess of my life, and I'm...\\
281 - I'm all alone.\\
282 - Okay, I think it'd be best for both of us       if I pretend to get a phone call and just walk away.\\
283 - Yeah, that would be best.\\
284 - Hello.\\
285 - This is Stuart.\\
286 - (whispering): Sorry.\\
287 - I got to take this.\\
288 - Uh, why, yes, I'd love to take a survey.\\
289 - Okay, this is where we first met.\\
290 - There's got to be a clue here somewhere.\\
291 - (gasps)\\
292 - We sat at that table.\\
293 - Excuse me.\\
294 - I'm sorry.\\
295 - We're on a scavenger hunt.\\
296 - Just pretend we're not here.\\
297 - Oh, I found something!\\
298 - (shrieks)\\
299 - It's gum.\\
300 - Maybe they left it behind the counter.\\
301 - I met my wife here, and we sat at this very table,       so if you play your cards right, in eight years,       you could marry this woman.\\
302 - That's my sister.\\
303 - Well, don't tell people.\\
304 - That's not okay.\\
305 - Sheldon, look, I asked the barista       if anyone left anything for us,       and she said to look in this lost and found box.\\
306 - But why would it be in the lost and found box?\\
307 - Because we were lost, and then we found each other.\\
308 - It makes perfect sense.\\
309 - Oh.\\
310 - And look at this.\\
311 - A locket.\\
312 - And that stone in front-- I bet it's quartz.\\
313 - This must be it.\\
314 - This must be the actual gift.\\
315 - Open it up.\\
316 - What's inside?\\
317 - Nothing.\\
318 - It's empty.\\
319 - Of course.\\
320 - Our life together is just starting,       and they want us to fill it with our memories.\\
321 - This might be the best wedding gift ever.\\
322 - (gasps)\\
323 - They also left us a pair of sunglasses       because our future's so bright!\\
324 - They thought of everything!\\
325 - Oh.\\
326 - Look what Halley drew.\\
327 - Yeah, she made it at daycare.\\
328 - It's pretty good, huh?\\
329 - Is it?\\
330 - Wow.\\
331 - Gentile moms are tough.\\
332 - (knocking on door)\\
333 - STUART: Guys, I need to show you something,       but you have to promise not to make fun of me.\\
334 - Of course.\\
335 - Whoa.\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - I was worried about the date       so I got my hair colored to make me feel a little more confident,       but that just made me look paler, so I-I got a spray tan.\\
338 - Have you tried showering,       seeing if you could scrub it off?\\
339 - I did.\\
340 - You're gonna need some new towels.\\
341 - And a bathmat.\\
342 - And a toilet seat.\\
343 - I'm picking her up in an hour.\\
344 - What am I gonna do?!\\
345 - Don't you mean what are you gonna       "Oompa Loompa doompety do"?\\
346 - You said you weren't gonna make any jokes.\\
347 - I'm sorry.\\
348 - I'll stop.\\
349 - (mouthing)\\
350 - (giggles)\\
351 - Look, it's only a spray tan.\\
352 - It'll fade in a couple days.\\
353 - Why don't you cancel the date and reschedule?\\
354 - Oh, but I was really looking forward to tonight.\\
355 - You know what?\\
356 - Then go.\\
357 - Tell her what happened.\\
358 - - Maybe she'll be flattered.\\
359 - WOLOWITZ: And if not,       swing by the chocolate factory and see if they're hiring.\\
360 - That wasn't a joke.\\
361 - That was a legitimate suggestion.\\
362 - (Skype ringing)\\
363 - DR.\\
364 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Hello?\\
365 - Hey, Dad.\\
366 - Rajesh.\\
367 - What a nice surprise, calling me on my birthday.\\
368 - Yes.\\
369 - That's why I'm calling.\\
370 - And-and what better gift to give you than the gift       of marrying an Indian woman, just like you've always wanted.\\
371 - My goodness, Rajesh, this is exciting news.\\
372 - Who is she?\\
373 - You tell me.\\
374 - What?\\
375 - I want you to arrange a marriage for me.\\
376 - I'm just so tired of being single,       and I'm finally just...\\
377 - I'm-I'm ready to settle down.\\
378 - I can't just call up some girl's dad       and make her marry you.\\
379 - It's-it's not      anymore.\\
380 - I know that, but I can't do this on my own.\\
381 - I need your help.\\
382 - (sighs)\\
383 - Well, then, I'm going to need your help, too.\\
384 - If I'm going to find a woman to set you up with,       you're going to need to stop Instagramming pictures       of you and your dog wearing matching sweaters.\\
385 - Fine, if that's what it takes to show you that I'm serious.\\
386 - Uh, quick question.\\
387 - Do you mean just Instagram, or all my social...?\\
388 - All of them!\\
389 - Okay, deal.\\
390 - All right.\\
391 - Let me ask you a question.\\
392 - What do you think of this woman?\\
393 - Oh.\\
394 - Oh, my God, she's beautiful.\\
395 - Is that who you're going to set me up with?\\
396 - No!\\
397 - That's who I'm dating.\\
398 - But maybe she has an older sister.\\
399 - So we put a little picture of me       and a little picture of Sheldon in it.\\
400 - In-in the locket?\\
401 - Yes.\\
402 - That was in a lost and found box?\\
403 - Exactly.\\
404 - Where we hid it?\\
405 - So really, you gave us three amazing gifts.\\
406 - You gave the locket, the adventure       and the realization that Amy and I can do anything       as long as we work together.\\
407 - - We wrote you a special thank you note.\\
408 - - Oh.\\
409 - Are those words?\\
410 - No.\\
411 - It's a secret code that you two get to figure out together.\\
412 - Hint: it's based on Sanskrit,       but not the Sanskrit you're thinking of.\\
413 - (laughs)\\
414 - And best of all, you can't use the Internet to cheat.\\
415 - Because we locked you out of your Wi-Fi,       and the answer to this is your new password.\\
416 - I'm no longer happy.\\
417 - Hey, guys.\\
418 - Great news.\\
419 - I'm getting married.\\
420 - - Huh?\\
421 - - What?\\
422 - - No.\\
423 - Well, I-I haven't met her yet,       but her name is Anu.\\
424 - My father says she comes from a good family.\\
425 - She's in her   s.\\
426 - She works in hospitality management.\\
427 - So, as long as I can get through six to ten dates       without revealing my true self...       ...this is happening.\\
428 - I know just what we're giving them for a wedding gift.\\
429 - Oh.\\
430 - Oh, my God.\\
431 - Yeah.\\
432 - I wanted to look my best for our date,       and I made a series of bad decisions...       ...\\
433 - one of which is hidden by my pants.\\
434 - Wow.\\
435 - (laughs)\\
436 - Do you still want to go out with me?\\
437 - Absolutely.\\
438 - Hey, maybe we can go find Nemo together.\\
439 - That's a good one.\\
440 - (clears throat)\\
441 - Do your    other crayon friends know you're out?\\
442 - Are you just gonna make fun of me all night?\\
443 - - Probably.\\
444 - - Great.\\
445 - So what are we thinking, Chinese?\\
446 - Yeah, I'm in the mood for orange chicken.
\subsection {Episode 03: The Procreation Calculation}
1 - So, Penny, we were talking to our neighbors,     and they're thinking of moving and selling their house.\\
2 - Really?\\
3 - Why?\\
4 - Something about babies crying     and keeping them up all night; it's not important.\\
5 - You guys should totally take a look at it.\\
6 - (laughs)\\
7 - Then we could be neighbors.\\
8 - Hey.\\
9 - Wait a minute, what about us?\\
10 - I mean, we're married now.\\
11 - Maybe we want to buy the house next door.\\
12 - Well, Amy, we can't move.\\
13 - I'd have to change all the tags in my underwear.\\
14 - You can buy new ones.\\
15 - What-- new house, new underwear.\\
16 - What am I,      in the Witness Protection Program?\\
17 - Okay.\\
18 - Guys, so what do you think?\\
19 - Well, I don't know, w-we're pretty happy here.\\
20 - Yeah.\\
21 - Plus, if we moved, we'd probably just get      a loft downtown.\\
22 - Really?\\
23 - I always figured we'd get a place with a yard.\\
24 - Oh, sure, yeah, that makes sense,      so you could shoot hoops and mow the lawn?\\
25 - How are you two married?\\
26 - You were there.\\
27 - I wore her down.\\
28 - He did.\\
29 - You guys should've talked about all this stuff      while you were dating.\\
30 - I mean, me and Anu already know so much about each other.\\
31 - Wait, I forget, is Anu your waxer?\\
32 - Uh, no, that's Annette.\\
33 - Anu is the woman my father fixed me up with.\\
34 - We're going on our first date tomorrow.\\
35 - Which reminds me, I need to see Annette.\\
36 - You're really letting your father pick out a wife?\\
37 - Why not?\\
38 - Arranged marriages have been working for thousands of years.\\
39 - Anu and I come from similar backgrounds,      our families get along and we each      filled out questionnaires, so we know we're not wasting our time      with someone who's not compatible.\\
40 - Oh, that sounds so dry and clinical.\\
41 - You lucky duck.\\
42 - I just don't think you can truly know someone      until you've spent a lot of time with them.\\
43 - Really?\\
44 - What's Penny's dream vacation?\\
45 - Uh, Malibu beach house.\\
46 - That's Barbie's dream vacation.\\
47 - Maybe you should send us that questionnaire.\\
48 -   Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state        Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
49 - Wait!\\
50 -        The Earth began to cool        The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools        We built the Wall   We built the pyramids        Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery        That all started with a big bang        Bang!    Enjoying your book?\\
51 - So much.\\
52 - Why do you keep poking at it?\\
53 - Fine, I'm shopping on my phone.\\
54 - You're the one who said you wanted to read more.\\
55 - Yes, I also tell people I only feed the kids organic.\\
56 - It's just stuff you say.\\
57 - (door closes)\\
58 - - Hey.\\
59 - - Ah, hello.\\
60 - Hey.\\
61 - How was your night?\\
62 - Ah, it was great.\\
63 - We went to an improv show.\\
64 - Yeah.\\
65 - They asked the audience to suggest a word,      and they used Stuart's.\\
66 - Oh, cool, what was it?\\
67 - Coconuts.\\
68 - It was such a good one.\\
69 - (chuckles)\\
70 - It just came to me.\\
71 - Uh, what are you guys up to?\\
72 - Reading.\\
73 - Oh, nice, I wish I read more.\\
74 - Well, if it's important, you find the time.\\
75 - You want to see my room?\\
76 - - Yeah.\\
77 - - Cool.\\
78 - (quietly): How do you feel about this?\\
79 - That she can clearly do better, but that's not for me to say.\\
80 - No, with them in his room, doing stuff.\\
81 - Oh, come on, we're sitting right out here.\\
82 - They're not gonna do anything.\\
83 -  Smooth operator        Smooth operator...       I'd like to change my answer.\\
84 -  Smooth operator.      Wow, you really are good at this.\\
85 - Well, I've spent a lot of time painting D&D miniatures.\\
86 - I know that makes you want to rip my shirt off,      but wait until your nails are dry.\\
87 - (phone chimes)\\
88 - Oh, it's Raj.\\
89 - He sent us that Indian marriage questionnaire.\\
90 - - Ooh, read one.\\
91 - - Okay.\\
92 - "How religious are you?"       That's easy, both of us: not at all.\\
93 - No, I wouldn't say not at all.\\
94 - I mean, I am pretty spiritual.\\
95 - I do go to yoga, so...\\
96 - Great, so your church is Our Lady of the Stretchy Pants.\\
97 - Next question.\\
98 - Uh, "how close are you with your family?"       Pretty close.\\
99 - I'm gonna say not too close,       but I'm hoping to get farther.\\
100 - How do you feel about children?\\
101 - Um, they're okay, I guess.\\
102 - I mean, if I saw one, I wouldn't throw a rock at it.\\
103 - W-Why would you throw a rock at a child?\\
104 - (chuckles): I just said I wouldn't.\\
105 - The question is would you like to have kids.\\
106 - So, yeah, we want kids.\\
107 - Yeah-- someday.\\
108 - Right, like, in the next five years.\\
109 - Sure, uh, next question.\\
110 - "How are you with pets?"       Well, I did take care of Sheldon for    years,       and he only bit me twice.\\
111 - I have to say, uh, after reading your questionnaire,       I feel like I already know you.\\
112 - Totally.\\
113 - Me, too.\\
114 - Excuse me.\\
115 - Can we please get sparkling instead of tap,       some clean silverware and find out       what they're having?\\
116 - That looks delicious.\\
117 - Yes, ma'am.\\
118 - Thank you.\\
119 - So, you're an astrophysicist.\\
120 - Yes, ma'am.\\
121 - I-I mean, uh, just yes.\\
122 - U-Unless you prefer "ma'am."       I don't.\\
123 - Good, because you don't seem like a ma'am.\\
124 - You seem more like a sweet thang.\\
125 - Wow.\\
126 - You are not good at this.\\
127 - (chuckles)\\
128 - Well, if I was good at this,       I wouldn't need to be fixed up by my father.\\
129 - I never thought I'd let my family set me up, either,       but I'm   , I'd like to have kids       and it's hard to date because I work so much.\\
130 - Oh, yes, uh, you're a concierge.\\
131 - For now.\\
132 - I plan to be managing a hotel in the next five years.\\
133 - Four, if I can get the current manager out of the way.\\
134 - He's a smoker, so fingers crossed.\\
135 - I-I get it.\\
136 - You know, um, I used to have a long list       of what I wanted from a wife.\\
137 - Uh, eyes like       Sandra Bullock, hair like Sandra Bullock,       and the bravery of Ryan Stone.\\
138 - That's Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity.       But now,       I-I just want someone nice.\\
139 - I think I'm nice.\\
140 - Are you nice?\\
141 - Oh, I'm definitely nice.\\
142 - Every time a girl breaks up with me she always starts with,       "You're a nice guy."       Look, your whole sweet, insecure thing is cute,       but honestly, I have no time for that.\\
143 - If you're not serious about this,       you need to walk away now.\\
144 - I-I am serious.\\
145 - Good.\\
146 - Okay.\\
147 - (chuckles)\\
148 - O-Okay, w-what does this mean?\\
149 - I think it means I might be the future Mrs....\\
150 - Koothrappali.\\
151 - How would you feel if I didn't change my name?\\
152 - A little hurt, but you wouldn't know, because I'm too nice.\\
153 - Hey, want to get lunch?\\
154 - I can't.\\
155 - Halley and Michael were up all night, and I'm way behind here.\\
156 - - Oh, no, are they sick?\\
157 - - No.\\
158 - They were just laughing and playing like a couple of jerks.\\
159 - Boy, they're cute, but they ruin everything.\\
160 - I get that.\\
161 - You know, I've been thinking lately       that maybe I don't want kids.\\
162 - Are you crazy?\\
163 - Of course you want them.\\
164 - It's amazing.\\
165 - You just said they ruin everything.\\
166 - I'm allowed to.\\
167 - It's their fault I pee when I laugh.\\
168 - Hang on, why is it crazy       to say I might not want kids?\\
169 - Oh, it's not crazy.\\
170 - It's just wrong.\\
171 - You only think you don't want kids,       but once you have kids, you'll realize that you did want them.\\
172 - Or I don't want them, so I won't have them, so back off.\\
173 - Aw, you sound just like me before I became a mom       and learned what the meaning of love was.\\
174 - Wow, I cannot believe how condescending you're being.\\
175 - Look, I know it's scary, but you're gonna be a great mom.\\
176 - I know I'd be great, but the point is I don't want to be one.\\
177 - Maybe you wouldn't be great.\\
178 - You kind of got a temper.\\
179 - You know, not everyone needs to have kids to be fulfilled.\\
180 - You're right, you've got Leonard.\\
181 - What more do you need?\\
182 - - Hey, guys.\\
183 - - Hello.\\
184 - - Hey.\\
185 - How was your date?\\
186 - Ah, let me answer that with a question.\\
187 - How would you like to be my best man?\\
188 - (laughs softly)\\
189 - Wait, you're not seriously       marrying a woman you've met once.\\
190 - Why not?\\
191 - She's nice, I'm nice.\\
192 - We're just as likely to be happy as any other two people.\\
193 - Maybe even happier.\\
194 - Sorry, that was not a swipe at you.\\
195 - I didn't think it was.\\
196 - Yeah, good, 'cause it was not.\\
197 - SHELDON: Well, I, for one,       applaud Raj's decision to forgo emotional attachment       and find a life partner by bowing       to a  ,   -year-old authoritarian tradition.\\
198 - What are you talking about?\\
199 - You married a woman you're in love with.\\
200 - I can't believe you're throwing that back in my face.\\
201 - Why can't you just be happy for me?\\
202 - Because you're being dumb.\\
203 - You don't know anything about her.\\
204 - W-Well, how come you all get to be married       and I have to stay single?\\
205 - I think that's a question for a licensed professional.\\
206 - You know what, you're not just insulting me.\\
207 - Okay?\\
208 - You're insulting my family, my culture       and my future bride, Anu,       a vegetarian with a master's degree from Cornell       whose favorite fruit is pineapple.\\
209 - Now, I'm not sure if this helps, but did you know       that pineapples were once so rare       that King Charles posed for a portrait with one?\\
210 - How does that help?\\
211 - Oh, it helped me.\\
212 - I've been trying to slide that       into a conversation for years.\\
213 - (door closes)\\
214 - Hey, honey, how was your day?\\
215 - (groans)\\
216 - What's wrong?\\
217 - Raj is talking about       marrying this woman he just met.\\
218 - I told him it was dumb, and now he's mad at me.\\
219 - The same thing happened to me.\\
220 - Penny said she didn't want kids,       and I told her she was being silly,       and she accused me of being condescending.\\
221 - Which is crazy, because if I wanted to be condescending,       I would've said, "Ooh, 'condescending.'       That's such a big word."       Why won't our friends just listen to us?\\
222 - We obviously know what we're talking about.\\
223 - I know.\\
224 - We're married, we have great kids,       great jobs, this great house.\\
225 -  Smooth operator         Smooth operator...         Smooth operator         Smooth operator...\\
226 -         Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago         Western male.        Hey, Leonard, remember yesterday       when we were talking about having kids someday?\\
227 - Yeah?\\
228 - Well, what if it wasn't someday.\\
229 - Oh, my God.\\
230 - Oh, my God, are you pregnant?\\
231 - No.\\
232 - No.\\
233 - No, no.\\
234 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
235 - So?\\
236 - - No.\\
237 - - Oh.\\
238 - What I meant was,       what if, what if we didn't have kids?\\
239 - Ever?\\
240 - I mean, our life is so great.\\
241 - Why would we want to change that?\\
242 - Sure.\\
243 - Sure.\\
244 - Sure.\\
245 - (stammers)\\
246 - And I guess it would be hard raising kids       in the-the loft you never told me you wanted.\\
247 - Well, wait, don't be mad.\\
248 - I'm not mad.\\
249 - Why would I be mad?\\
250 - There's nothing to be mad at!\\
251 - You have to-to turn the thing.\\
252 - I knew that!\\
253 - AMY: Hi, Leonard.\\
254 - - I'm not mad!\\
255 - You're awfully quiet.\\
256 - - Sorry.\\
257 - - No, I like it.\\
258 - Got a lot on my mind.\\
259 - Would you like to talk about it?\\
260 - Not really.\\
261 - Grape Nuts for breakfast, quiet car ride,       things are really breaking my way today.\\
262 - It's just Penny hit me with some pretty big news       and it's a lot to process.\\
263 - And you'd like to do that quietly.\\
264 - I respect that.\\
265 - She said she doesn't want to have kids.\\
266 - Maybe she didn't mean it,       like when you said you didn't want to talk about this.\\
267 - Forget it.\\
268 - Do you want to have children?\\
269 - Well, I always assumed we would and now I find out, you know,       I might be the last of the Hofstadter line.\\
270 - Doesn't your brother have children?\\
271 - And your sister.\\
272 - She kept the Hofstadter name       and has five healthy boys:       Neil, Jeffrey, Scott, William and baby Richard.\\
273 - I'm going back to being quiet.\\
274 - Sweet.\\
275 - Hey.\\
276 - Mind if I sit?\\
277 - Did you just come here to tell me I'm making a gigantic mistake       by having this blueberry muffin       and I should've got a cinnamon roll like you did?\\
278 - No.\\
279 - Good, 'cause I'm happy with my choice.\\
280 - Although that cinnamon roll does smell good       if you're open to halfsies.\\
281 - - Fine.\\
282 - - Thanks.\\
283 - Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.\\
284 - You're right.\\
285 - I-I was being...\\
286 - Oh, my God, that is so good!\\
287 - I can wait.\\
288 - No...\\
289 - (clears throat)\\
290 - Sorry.\\
291 - Go on.\\
292 - I've known you a long time.\\
293 - You believe in romance more than any person I've ever met       and it's hard to see you give up on that.\\
294 - But if you really think marrying this woman       is gonna make you happy,       then you have my complete and total support.\\
295 - I will be with you every step of the way.\\
296 - Thanks, Howard.\\
297 - That means a lot.\\
298 - So, hey, is this wedding gonna be in India?\\
299 - Ah, maybe.\\
300 - Ugh.\\
301 - What the hell, Penny?!\\
302 - I'm gonna need more than that.\\
303 - You're not having kids?\\
304 - How could you do this to me?\\
305 - How is it any of your business?\\
306 - Because your kids were supposed to be friends with my kids.\\
307 - Who's gonna be friends with them now?\\
308 - They will find other friends.\\
309 - Oh, sure, 'cause Sheldon's DNA plus my DNA       equals a kid who knows how to make friends.\\
310 - Grow up!\\
311 - This is between me and Leonard.\\
312 - Screw Leonard!\\
313 - We were supposed to get pregnant together.\\
314 - We were gonna be barf buddies.\\
315 - We were supposed to massage each other's perineums       with vitamin E.\\
316 - I'm about to be your barf buddy right now.\\
317 - Listen, when you have kids,       I'm still gonna be there.\\
318 - I'm gonna be their fun Aunt Penny who gives them candy,       and teaches them swear words       and tells them stories about what a weirdo their mother is.\\
319 - I guess I could live with that.\\
320 - What is gonna be hard is letting go of the dream       of us breastfeeding each other's babies.\\
321 - And it's gonna be hard to forget you said that.\\
322 - No.\\
323 - What would you say if I told you       I was totally naked under this robe?\\
324 - I would say that sounds pretty good.\\
325 - Really?\\
326 - Well, I did not see that coming.\\
327 - One second.\\
328 -  Smooth operator        Oh, come on.\\
329 - Wait.\\
330 - Stay in the mood.\\
331 - I'll put on our own music and drown them out.\\
332 -  You want a hot body?        What's this?\\
333 - It's from my workout mix.\\
334 - It's what I listen to when I'm firming up my glutes.\\
335 - (Neil crying)\\
336 - Can you get him?\\
337 - Sure.\\
338 - - Hey, Howard.\\
339 - - Yeah?\\
340 - It looks like you could crack a walnut in those glutes.\\
341 - I can't.\\
342 - I tried.\\
343 - Hey.\\
344 - - Hey.\\
345 - - I-I made you dinner.\\
346 - Your favorite: In-N-Out Burger out of the wrapper on a plate.\\
347 - Thank you, but you don't have to do this.\\
348 - I'm fine.\\
349 - I-I know it's not a baby, but it does leak when you pick it up.\\
350 - Really?\\
351 - We're joking about this now?\\
352 - No, look, I'm sorry.\\
353 - I didn't mean to just drop all of this on you.\\
354 - I-It just took me by surprise.\\
355 - I-I always imagined having kids.\\
356 - I know you did.\\
357 - But I've imagined having a lot of things       that I'm never gonna get:       a Nobel Prize, a working Batmobile.\\
358 - But I also have a lot that I never thought I'd have...\\
359 - like you.\\
360 - Are you sure that's enough?\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - - You're really okay with this?\\
363 - - I am.\\
364 - (ringtone plays)\\
365 - Hey, Daddy.\\
366 - What's this Leonard says       about you not wanting to give me grandbabies?\\
367 - He might feel differently.\\
368 - Bye.\\
369 - I told my parents our first date went well       and they got very excited.\\
370 - Oh, tell me about it.\\
371 - My parents were so thrilled,       they actually spoke to each other.\\
372 - So that was a disaster.\\
373 - Cheers.\\
374 - (clears throat)\\
375 - Okay.\\
376 - I guess if we're going forward with this wedding,       we should talk about the next steps.\\
377 - Oh, like themes and flowers?\\
378 - Actually, finances and taxes.\\
379 - Oh.\\
380 - We can't use that.\\
381 - That was the theme of my parents' divorce.\\
382 - I know that money can be a source of friction       in a new marriage and I want us to avoid that.\\
383 - Of course.\\
384 - Yeah, right.\\
385 - That's s-smart.\\
386 - So, my accountant feels strongly       that we should file separately the first year       and then we can re-evaluate based on our joint assets.\\
387 - You okay?\\
388 - No, I can't do this.\\
389 - Why not?\\
390 - Th-There's something you may not know about me       'cause, you know, we've only met once, but...\\
391 - I'm a hopeless romantic.\\
392 - And you seem great       and I do want to get married.\\
393 - I-I do want to settle down, but...\\
394 - this isn't the story that I want to tell my grandkids.\\
395 - I understand.\\
396 - I'm so sorry if I wasted your time.\\
397 - Raj.\\
398 - I know we don't know each other very well,       but you seem like you'd make a good father       and you're tall enough so I can wear heels and...\\
399 - I think that's something worth fighting for.\\
400 - Will you marry me?\\
401 - (stammers)\\
402 - Oh, my God, oh, my God.\\
403 - Yes, of course, of course I'll marry you!\\
404 - - If you'd like to kiss me you can.\\
405 - - Oh, great.\\
406 - I should warn you I have a tongue piercing.\\
407 - Oh, you're not that nice.\\
408 - (both laugh)\\
409 - Are you gonna tell me where we're going?\\
410 - Because if it has the words "farmers" or "market" in it,       I don't want to go.\\
411 - You were talking about all the things       you thought you would never have,       so I thought I would get you one.\\
412 - Oh, my God.\\
413 - You bought me the Batmobile?!\\
414 - No.\\
415 - No.\\
416 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
417 - I rented you the Batmobile for the day.\\
418 - This is amazing.\\
419 - Thank you.\\
420 - (laughs)\\
421 - B-Be careful.\\
422 - I-I did not get the insurance.\\
423 - (engine starts, revs)\\
424 - (chuckles)\\
425 - Come on, Robin!
\subsection {Episode 04: The Tam Turbulence}
1 - Hey, whatcha doing?\\
2 - Improving our wedding photos.\\
3 - Oh, that's nice.\\
4 - Wait, I'm still in them, right?\\
5 - Of course.\\
6 - And not only you.\\
7 - I've added some guests who couldn't be there.\\
8 - Who's that next to my father?\\
9 - The Wright brothers.\\
10 - And why are they at our wedding?\\
11 - Orville, because I admire him;    Wilbur, because he was Orville's plus-one.\\
12 - (computer chimes)\\
13 - Oh.\\
14 - You got an e-mail from someone named Tam.\\
15 - Tam?\\
16 - What does he want?\\
17 - Uh...\\
18 - looks like he's coming to give his son a tour of Caltech.\\
19 - He's hoping you guys can meet up.\\
20 - (scoffs)\\
21 - He would like that, wouldn't he?\\
22 - Well, that is the gist of the e-mail.\\
23 - Who's Tam?\\
24 - He was my best friend    in the whole world growing up.\\
25 - Really?\\
26 - Why have I never heard you mention him before?\\
27 - Oh, of course I have.\\
28 - I'm sure I've mentioned him,    like, five times this week.\\
29 - I don't think you have.\\
30 - Tam!\\
31 - Tam!\\
32 - Tam!\\
33 - Tam!\\
34 - Tam!\\
35 - There, it's only Thursday.\\
36 - I didn't just drink the crazy milk, I bought the crazy cow.\\
37 -   Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
38 - Wait!\\
39 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!     So, are you actually engaged to this woman you just met?\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - Tell us the truth.\\
42 - Did she get you pregnant?\\
43 - Very funny.\\
44 - Guys, I need your help, okay?\\
45 - I'm trying    to buy her engagement ring.\\
46 - What do you think of this?\\
47 - Do you think she'll like this one?\\
48 - Well, it's hard to say, not knowing much about her.\\
49 - Does she have fingers?\\
50 - Yes, she has ten fingers    and ten toes.\\
51 - Probably.\\
52 - I'll get back to you after I see her in sandals.\\
53 - Hey, did you guys know that Sheldon had    a best friend growing up named Tam?\\
54 - Was that the imaginary talking koala?\\
55 - No.\\
56 - He's a real person who apparently betrayed him.\\
57 - Yeah, so did the koala.\\
58 - I tried to ask him about it,    and he invoked section three, article five    of the marriage contract: beeswax comma none of your.\\
59 - I can't pry.\\
60 - I mean,    I have to respect his wishes.\\
61 - Wow.\\
62 - I wonder what that guy could've done    to make Sheldon not talk to him for    years.\\
63 - I wonder if it'd work a second time.\\
64 - (video game sound effects)\\
65 - (knocking)\\
66 - I'm pumping!\\
67 - It's Penny.\\
68 - Oh.\\
69 - Come in.\\
70 - I thought you were pumping.\\
71 - I thought you were my boss.\\
72 - Okay, listen, I'm really worried about this whole Raj thing.\\
73 - I know, he's so desperate to get married, which is weird,    because I can't imagine we make it look that great.\\
74 - I know, right?\\
75 - You know,    if this woman's gonna be around, I think    we should check her out a little.\\
76 - I looked online.\\
77 - She doesn't have an Instagram,    which means she's either   or something's wrong with her.\\
78 - Well, I could ask my dad.\\
79 - Maybe he can get some of his old cop buddies    to do a background check on her.\\
80 - - Would he do that?\\
81 - - Of course.\\
82 - He's a retired cop who plays by his own rules.\\
83 - Hi, Daddy.\\
84 - No, everything's good.\\
85 - I just have a favor to ask.\\
86 - Yeah, so, my friend Raj    is marrying this woman that he barely knows,    and I wanted to see if you could use your connections    to dig up any dirt on her.\\
87 - Uh-huh.\\
88 - Sure.\\
89 - Okay.\\
90 - Love you.\\
91 - Is he in?\\
92 - Absolutely not.\\
93 - He won't do it.\\
94 - It's totally illegal.\\
95 - I thought you said he played by his own rules.\\
96 - He does, but apparently, they're very similar    to the actual rules.\\
97 - I still can't believe Sheldon had a best friend     we've never heard about.\\
98 -  Ooh, somebody's jealous.     - I'm not jealous.\\
99 - - Leonard,     this is a safe space-- it's okay to be vulnerable.\\
100 -  All I'm saying is     you know the timing of a fellow's bowel movements,     you don't think there's a lot left to discover.\\
101 -  I wonder what Tam could have done.\\
102 -  Hmm.\\
103 - Well, if Sheldon doesn't want to talk about it,     it's got to be pretty upsetting.\\
104 -  I have his brother George's number-- he might know.\\
105 -  Really?\\
106 - You have George's number?\\
107 -  So so jealous.     Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,     Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.\\
108 -  The two of them were always running around together.\\
109 -  So, what happened?\\
110 -  What do you mean?\\
111 -  Well, I mean, Sheldon never talks about him.\\
112 -  They haven't spoken in years.\\
113 - He wasn't at the wedding.\\
114 -  He wasn't?\\
115 -  All right, well, this is embarrassing,     'cause I had a long conversation     with someone who I thought was Tam.\\
116 -  Wait, wait, so you don't know what their fight was about?\\
117 -  I wish I could help you, boys.\\
118 -  But, you know, Sheldon used to keep     an enemies list when he was a kid.\\
119 -  Oh, he still does.\\
120 -  Really?\\
121 - I figured     that went the same way     as his bathroom schedule.\\
122 -  If you mean digitized, annotated and put online, it did.\\
123 -  Maybe that'll tell you something.\\
124 -  Hey, while you're looking at it, if I'm still on there     for peeing in his shampoo bottle...\\
125 -  Eh, you know what, just leave it.\\
126 -  - (laughs)\\
127 - See ya, boys.\\
128 - - Bye.\\
129 -  - Bye.\\
130 - - All right, got his enemies list.\\
131 -  Ooh, he updated the interface.\\
132 -  You can search by first name,     last name or length of grudge.\\
133 -  Is Tam on it?\\
134 -  Let's see.\\
135 -  Yep.\\
136 - Right here.\\
137 - Tam Nguyen.\\
138 -  - Oh, great.\\
139 - What did he do?\\
140 - - Hold on.\\
141 -  I have to agree to the terms of service.\\
142 -  No, I'm not a robot.\\
143 -  Okay.\\
144 -  "Which of these are plants?"     And we're in.\\
145 -  Great.\\
146 - What-what does it say?\\
147 -  Well...\\
148 -  "He knows what he did.": Oh, come on.\\
149 -  Wait.\\
150 - Wait, wait, wait, if Tam knows     what he did, we can just ask him.\\
151 -  He's gonna be on campus tomorrow showing his son around.\\
152 -  Won't that make Sheldon mad?\\
153 -  Everything makes Sheldon mad.\\
154 -  - Yeah.\\
155 - - Look at his list.\\
156 -  Jim Henson for, quote,     "putting a terrifying, giant yellow bird on television     and in my nightmares."     - Oh, this is so nice.\\
157 - - Mm-hmm.\\
158 -  Maybe instead of introducing ourselves to Anu,     we could just get a room,     order some food and take a nap.\\
159 -  Yeah, I've fallen for that line before.\\
160 -  It never leads to napping.\\
161 -  That must be her.\\
162 -  Oh.\\
163 - She's cute.\\
164 -  Okay, I got you two seats to Hamilton tonight.\\
165 -  Your tickets will be at the concierge desk.\\
166 -  Of course.\\
167 - My pleasure.\\
168 -  May I help you?\\
169 -  Yes, I'm here to pick up our Hamilton tickets.\\
170 -  Stop.\\
171 -  Hi.\\
172 - We're Raj's friends.\\
173 -  I'm Penny.\\
174 - This is Bernadette.\\
175 -  We just came by to introduce ourselves.\\
176 -  So you came to check me out?\\
177 -  She's smart.\\
178 - I like her.\\
179 -  We just want to see if we could take you     to dinner and get to know you a bit.\\
180 -  That sounds nice.\\
181 - How about tonight after work?\\
182 -  Maybe we can go to Bavel.\\
183 -  Oh, I wish.\\
184 - That place is impossible to get into.\\
185 -  Oh, please.\\
186 - Getting into impossible places     is my superpower.\\
187 -  BERNADETTE: Me, too.\\
188 -  I can fit my whole body in our dryer.\\
189 -  All set.\\
190 - :  .\\
191 -  Wow.\\
192 - Okay, well, we'll see you tonight.\\
193 -  - See you then.\\
194 - - Okay.\\
195 -  Bye.\\
196 -  She can get into any restaurant,     but the best husband she can find is Raj?\\
197 -  Not Tam.\\
198 -  Not Tam.\\
199 -  Not Tam.\\
200 -  Got him.\\
201 -  - Tam Nguyen?\\
202 - - Yeah.\\
203 - Yes.\\
204 -  Is my son done with his tour?\\
205 -  No idea.\\
206 - We're actually friends of Sheldon Cooper.\\
207 -  Oh, I've been trying to get in touch with him,     but I never heard back.\\
208 - Is he okay?\\
209 -  Well, if you mean physically, yes.\\
210 -  If you mean every other way, no.\\
211 -  - So, is he here?\\
212 - LEONARD: Uh, no.\\
213 -  He-he didn't come.\\
214 -  He's, uh...\\
215 -  he's still pretty upset about...\\
216 -  you know.\\
217 -  I know what?\\
218 -  Come on,     you-you must know.\\
219 -  No, we haven't talked in, like,    years.\\
220 -  Right.\\
221 - Because...\\
222 -  you know.\\
223 -  I don't think he knows.\\
224 -  What are you guys talking about?\\
225 -  Why did you and Sheldon stop being friends?\\
226 -  - What did you do?\\
227 - - And don't worry,     even though we just met you,     we think you're right and he's wrong.\\
228 -  I didn't do anything.\\
229 -  He moved to California, and we just drifted apart.\\
230 -  Oh, come on, there's got to be something...\\
231 -  - Oh, hey, Sheldon.\\
232 -  - We just met...\\
233 - - Sheldon!\\
234 - So good to see you!\\
235 -  Tam.\\
236 -  It's been a long time.\\
237 -  Mm, not long enough to erase the sting of betrayal.\\
238 -  How did I betray you?\\
239 -  You know what you did.\\
240 -  Uh, let me catch you up.\\
241 -  He does not.\\
242 -  When I moved to California, what did you do?\\
243 -  I stayed in Texas.\\
244 -  Do you believe this guy?!\\
245 -  So, he was your best friend growing up?\\
246 -  Yes.\\
247 -  Were there no other kids in Texas?\\
248 -  Hey.\\
249 - What is going on with you?\\
250 -  I don't want to talk about it.\\
251 -  Well, I'm sure you have a perfectly stupid reason.\\
252 -  I don't do anything for a stupid reason.\\
253 -  Except, perhaps, Talk Like a Pirate Day,     and I'd argue that's more whimsical than stupid.\\
254 -  You know, I was curious to find out what Tam had done wrong.\\
255 -  Why am I not surprised the answer is nothing?\\
256 -  So you're taking his side.\\
257 -  You scurvy dog.\\
258 -  You watch yourself.\\
259 - There is room on my enemies list     now that the cafeteria ladies finally told me     what's in the chili.\\
260 -  By the way, don't eat the chili.\\
261 -  Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?\\
262 -  Do.\\
263 -  Be careful, Sheldon.\\
264 -  I don't think you can afford to lose a second best friend.\\
265 -  I don't see anyone lining up to be your third.\\
266 -  D...\\
267 - Wait.\\
268 -  "Snarky comebacks..."     Oh, here we go.\\
269 -  "You have your entire life to be a jerk,     why not take today off?"     That was harsh, but he was asking for it.\\
270 -  This place is amazing.\\
271 -  I can't believe you got us in here.\\
272 -  Well, it's kind of my job.\\
273 -  Usually I get tipped for it, but I'll leave that up to you.\\
274 -  (giggles)\\
275 -  Look, I think that's LeBron over there.\\
276 -  James?\\
277 -  No, LeBron Kershenbaum.\\
278 -  So, what do you want to know?\\
279 -  Well, you seem like a smart, successful woman,     why would you want to marry someone you just met?\\
280 -  Fair question.\\
281 -  In my   s, I tried this the normal way.\\
282 -  You know, met a guy, fell in love,     we moved in together.\\
283 -  I put him through culinary school, screenwriting classes,     and finally dumped him when he wanted to become a midwife.\\
284 -  Then I realized,     my parents are happy; they had an arranged marriage.\\
285 -  Why am I fighting this?\\
286 -  I dunno, I married for love     and it turned out...\\
287 - fine.\\
288 -  Oh, yeah, me, too.\\
289 -  AMY: Hi.\\
290 -  Howard, today is your lucky day.\\
291 -  Leonard's out, you're my new best friend.\\
292 -  Well, I'm not thrilled about it either,     but here we are.\\
293 -  Okay, fine.\\
294 -  Is Bernadette there?\\
295 -  Sh...\\
296 - No.\\
297 -  Just Stuart?\\
298 -  Let me call you back.\\
299 -  Let me guess.\\
300 -  This thing with Tam escalated,     and now you're mad at Leonard     and looking for a new best friend?\\
301 -  You know me so well.\\
302 -  It's too bad you can't be my best friend.\\
303 -  I can be.\\
304 -  You can't be my wife and my best friend.\\
305 -  Who would I complain about you to?\\
306 -  Just tell me what happened.\\
307 -  Leonard talked to Tam behind my back and took his side.\\
308 -  And after what he did to me.\\
309 - Can you believe it?\\
310 -  No.\\
311 - I'm-I'm shocked and outraged.\\
312 -  Now, tell me why I'm shocked and outraged.\\
313 -  Fine.\\
314 -  When I got accepted to grad school at Caltech,     I was afraid to move so far away from home.\\
315 -  So Tam said he'd move out here with me     and be my roommate.\\
316 - Then,     over the summer, he got a girlfriend,     even after reading all the pamphlets     I gave him about social diseases.\\
317 -  Aw, I remember when you gave me those pamphlets.\\
318 -  Anyway, Tam stayed with her in Texas,     and I had to move out here all by myself.\\
319 -  That must've been scary.\\
320 -  It was.\\
321 -  I was lonely, and I thought     I'd never make a friend again.\\
322 -  And for a long time, I didn't.\\
323 -  But then you did.\\
324 -  And great friends.\\
325 -  If you think about it, if Tam had moved out here with you,     who knows what your life would've been like.\\
326 -  Yes.\\
327 -  Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.\\
328 - I called you     about the apartment.\\
329 - You said...\\
330 -  Tell him to go away.\\
331 - You already have a roommate.\\
332 -  New neighbor?\\
333 -  Oh, hi.\\
334 -  - Hi.\\
335 - - Hi.\\
336 -  - Hi.\\
337 - - Hi.\\
338 -  PENNY: Tam, look.\\
339 -  Sheldon's hugging me.\\
340 -  It's a Saturnalia miracle.\\
341 -  Sheldon, come here.\\
342 -  Bazinga.\\
343 -  No, my life would've still been great.\\
344 -  So what is the craziest request anyone's ever made?\\
345 -  Oh, you know, I can't really say.\\
346 -  Concierge-guest confidentiality.\\
347 -  Really, that's a thing?\\
348 -  (laughs)\\
349 - No.\\
350 -  This one time, I had to go to Walmart at  :   a.m.\\
351 -  because Britney Spears needed to blow bubbles.\\
352 -  - Oh.\\
353 - - That is so cool.\\
354 -  By the way, do not tell Raj that you met Britney Spears,     because he will literally die.\\
355 -  We've been talking so much about me,     tell me about Raj.\\
356 -  Okay, are you trying to get us drunk     so we'll dish on our friend?\\
357 -  'Cause it's totally gonna work, what do you want to know?\\
358 -  What kind of guy is he?\\
359 -  He is great.\\
360 -  - So great.\\
361 - - Mm-hmm.\\
362 -  How come he's still single?\\
363 -  - He's great.\\
364 - - So great.\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 -  Come on.\\
367 -  There's really nothing to tell.\\
368 -  Raj is so much fun to hang out with.\\
369 -  He's like one of our girlfriends.\\
370 -  And I mean that in a good way.\\
371 -  But also a bad way.\\
372 -  Anything else?\\
373 -  - No.\\
374 - - No.\\
375 -  I mean, h-he takes baths with his dog,     but not in a weird way.\\
376 -  Or a normal way; they both wear swimsuits.\\
377 -  He also cries every time Hugh Jackman sings.\\
378 -  But not cute sniffles-- full-on snot sobs.\\
379 -  But he is great.\\
380 -  - So great.\\
381 - - Yeah.\\
382 -  (knocking)\\
383 -  Hello, Sheldon.\\
384 -  Hello Tam.\\
385 - Thank you for coming.\\
386 -  I just want you to know that, um...\\
387 -  I forgive you.\\
388 -  I didn't do anything.\\
389 -  And yet, here I am,     still being the bigger man.\\
390 -  Look, I was in love with Beth,     and she made me happy.\\
391 -  Y...\\
392 - Really?\\
393 -  Did she let you play with her train set?\\
394 -  In a manner of speaking.\\
395 -  Sheldon, I needed to stay in Texas.\\
396 -  And you needed to come here.\\
397 -  I knew you were gonna do amazing things,     and meet amazing people who were gonna respect you,     because you're brilliant.\\
398 - And because they never had to     fish you out of a dumpster.\\
399 -  Well, they have, but it was during     my short-lived parkour phase.\\
400 -  I didn't mean to upset you.\\
401 -  And I want you to know I'm really proud     of everything you've done.\\
402 -  Thank you.\\
403 -  It did work out for me.\\
404 -  And I'm sorry that things didn't work out for you.\\
405 -  They did work out for me.\\
406 -  Oh, Tam, you don't need to be brave on my account.\\
407 -  I'm not.\\
408 -  I have a great wife and amazing children.\\
409 -  I'm very happy.\\
410 -  Brave, brave Tam.\\
411 -  Sounds like Penny and Bernadette had fun last night.\\
412 -  I know.\\
413 -  Bernie came home pretty drunk.\\
414 -  She tried to sleep in the dryer.\\
415 -  Hello, you all remember Tam, my best friend from high school.\\
416 -  - Yeah.\\
417 - - Of course.\\
418 - - How's it going?\\
419 -  Sheldon's been showing me and my son around.\\
420 -  Now we know where all the clean bathrooms are.\\
421 -  Yep.\\
422 -  You just remember the mnemonic:     if it's number one, the library's fun,     if it's number two, the basement's for you.\\
423 -  I'm glad you guys made up.\\
424 -  Well, I realized my life turned out great,     and it's silly to hold a grudge.\\
425 -  And I had no idea we were fighting, so it was easy.\\
426 -  Uh, don't worry, Leonard,     you're still my California best friend.\\
427 -  Cool.\\
428 -  So, what do you want to do now?\\
429 -  Go to the train store, go to the comic book store?\\
430 -  Actually, I have to grab my son and head to the airport.\\
431 -  I was just about to call a cab.\\
432 -  Don't be silly, you don't have to call a cab.\\
433 -  You're my oldest friend.\\
434 -  Leonard will take you.\\
435 - Right, Leonard?\\
436 -  Sure.\\
437 -  Shall we?\\
438 -  Eh, eh, eh, hold on.\\
439 -  I haven't seen Tam in    years,     give me a chance to say good-bye.\\
440 -  Bye.\\
441 -  Check it out-- LeBron James posted a picture     of me and him on Instagram.\\
442 -  I don't see you.\\
443 -  Look right behind him.\\
444 -  No.\\
445 -  Okay.\\
446 - You see that table just past his left shoulder?\\
447 -  Now go back two more tables and over to the right.\\
448 -  All I see is a yellow smudge.\\
449 -  That's me!\\
450 -  (phone rings)\\
451 -  Oh, it's Raj.\\
452 -  Hey Raj, I'm here with Penny.\\
453 -  KOOTHRAPPALI: What the hell did you two say to Anu?\\
454 -  Uh...\\
455 -  whatever do you mean?\\
456 -  Why, why would you tell her     I wear ladies' deodorant?\\
457 -  Uh, because you're a boy and it's really funny.\\
458 -  Oh, oh, okay.\\
459 - Pardon me     for having the confidence to smell daisy-fresh.\\
460 -  Just do me a favor and stay away from her.\\
461 -  Ugh, God, now I feel bad.\\
462 -  I know.\\
463 -  Maybe we should take her out again     and do some damage control.\\
464 -  You know, that's a good idea.\\
465 -  Think she can get us into SoHo House?\\
466 -  I don't know, but we owe it to Raj to try.\\
467 -  Mm-hmm.
\subsection {Episode 05: The Planetarium Collision}
1 - Recently,    new moons   were discovered orbiting Jupiter,   bringing the total up to   .\\
2 - As a middle child myself, I'd like to extend   my sympathies to moons two through   .\\
3 - Your grandpa will never learn your name.\\
4 - I'd like to thank you for joining me on this journey   (laughs)\\
5 - through the stars.\\
6 - If you enjoyed this lecture,    please come back Thursday for the exact same one.\\
7 - Do I look like I just woke up?\\
8 - No.\\
9 - Great. I'm gonna go say hey to Raj.\\
10 - What were you guys giggling about?\\
11 - They were passing notes to each other.\\
12 - Oh-ho, love notes?\\
13 - If you love math.\\
14 - And we do.\\
15 - It's for our super-asymmetry theory.\\
16 - Yeah, Amy and I have been having so much fun    collaborating together.\\
17 - Well, you know what they say, you never collaborate    as much as your first year of marriage.\\
18 - - Hey, great show. - Thanks.\\
19 - Oh, Howard, uh, this is Andrea.\\
20 - She's the director of the planetarium.\\
21 - Hi.\\
22 - Nice to meet you. I'm Howard Wolowitz.\\
23 - Engineer, husband, father...\\
24 - (chuckles)\\
25 - ...astronaut.\\
26 - Really?\\
27 - You're an astronaut?\\
28 - Well, I don't like to brag.\\
29 - Hmm, yeah, but somehow, you manage.\\
30 - Raj, you should have Howard join you for one of your shows.\\
31 - Oh, that might be fun.\\
32 - But-- it might be, but with two small children at home    and a full-time job, I'm sure you're too busy.\\
33 - No, I could find the time.\\
34 - Well, you don't have to decide right now.\\
35 - It's okay, I...\\
36 - He can't do it.\\
37 - Hey, hurry up, guys.\\
38 - The gift shop's closing, and Amy said    I can get one big thing or two little things.\\
39 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state      Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!\\
40 -      The Earth began to cool      The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools      We built the Wall   We built the pyramids      Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery      That all started with a big bang      Bang!      So I'm gonna place the sensory isolation helmet on you    for about five minutes.\\
41 - All you need to do    is sit still and relax.\\
42 - What do I do if I start to get claustrophobic?\\
43 - Oh, the helmet will sense that and stop the experiment.\\
44 - Really?\\
45 - No, but that would be cool, wouldn't it?\\
46 - Amy, are you busy?\\
47 - I've got a subject wired up for a sensory study.\\
48 - So...\\
49 - Yes, I'm busy.\\
50 - Oh.\\
51 - I'm tracking a subject's brain activity    in real time as we introduce olfactory stimuli.\\
52 - I'm smelling baby powder.\\
53 - That's just my husband.\\
54 - Well, I had a thought about our super-asymmetry theory.\\
55 - Let me show you this one thing.\\
56 - Well, I-I want to see it,    but not when I'm in the middle of an experiment.\\
57 - Still baby powder!\\
58 - Boy, he is annoying. Do any of those buttons shock him?\\
59 - Look, I'm really excited about our paper, too,    but I've got a lot of my own work    to catch up on, so let's talk later.\\
60 - Okay, I'll just say one more thing: lambda calculus.\\
61 - And if that wets your whistle, you know where to find me.\\
62 - Boop.\\
63 - You okay?\\
64 - You seem distracted.\\
65 - I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.\\
66 - I'm thinking about Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.\\
67 - He sort of hurt my feelings.\\
68 - (quietly): Biceps, hammer, abs. Still in it.\\
69 - Why wouldn't he want me to be in his planetarium show?\\
70 - And it's gone.\\
71 - Sorry, it's just the director of the planetarium thought    it'd be fun for me to join Raj for one of his shows,    and he made it clear that he didn't want me to.\\
72 - Of course he wouldn't want you to.\\
73 - I mean, think about it. If you were him,    would you want to share the stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?\\
74 - I don't know. How sexy are we talking?\\
75 - Oh, you know, tight pants, huge biceps, magic hammer.\\
76 - - Wait, w-who are we talk... - Shh, I'm back in it.\\
77 - SHELDON: (stammers)\\
78 - The fundamental problem     with elementary quantum mechanical formalism     is that the Fourier transform     extends to minus infinity in time.\\
79 - Hey, don't dumb this down for me.\\
80 - Penny, I'm...\\
81 - Late for that thing. See you.\\
82 - Leonard!\\
83 -  Oh, Sheldon.\\
84 - Didn't see you there. What's up?\\
85 -  Well, uh, he was excited to talk science     with Amy, but she was working late,     so he decided to come over and share it with me.\\
86 - With me, Leonard.\\
87 - With me.\\
88 - Sheldon, we've talked about this.\\
89 - You can't go around boring other people's wives.\\
90 - PENNY: Yeah.\\
91 - I already got a man for that.\\
92 - - Yeah, you do. - Yeah.\\
93 - It's just, I've just been enjoying     my collaboration with Amy,     but ever since we got back from our honeymoon,     she has so little time.\\
94 - Well, she does have her own job.\\
95 - Yeah, but it's so dull.\\
96 - Trying to understand how the brain     translates the five senses into biochemical information.\\
97 - I'd rather wait in line without my phone.\\
98 - Okay, well, Leonard's here now. You can talk science with him.\\
99 - Where you going?\\
100 -  Oh, that thing you were late for.\\
101 - One of us should really be there.\\
102 - Hey. Got a sec?\\
103 -  Sure. What's up?\\
104 -  I just want to let you know I get     why you don't want me to be a part of the planetarium show.\\
105 - Oh, great. Thanks for stopping by.\\
106 - You don't want to talk about the stars     next to an actual astronaut.\\
107 - That would be like doing karaoke with a rock star.\\
108 - First of all, I've totally done karaoke with a rock star.\\
109 - Or are you forgetting when the Spin Doctors     handed me the mic at the Orange County Fair?\\
110 -  Listen, I understand you being intimidated,     but I can't help that I'm proud of being an astronaut.\\
111 - It's a big deal.\\
112 - Oh, it certainly is, but I also happen to be     very accomplished in my field.\\
113 - Great. So you have no reason     to be scared of sharing the spotlight.\\
114 - Please. I may be scared of heights and spiders     and showing up at a costume party     that turns out to be a regular party,     but I am not scared of sharing the spotlight with you!\\
115 -  What's happening?\\
116 -  I just stormed out for dramatic effect.\\
117 - I... Actually, I-I don't have anywhere to go.\\
118 - President Siebert, how much do you know about physics?\\
119 -  I'm a physicist.\\
120 - Huh. I would not have guessed that.\\
121 - I have a doctorate from Indiana University.\\
122 - Oh, that makes more sense.\\
123 - Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.\\
124 - Thank you.\\
125 - Dr. Fowler and I have been working on     a theory of super-asymmetry     that could reconcile the lack of observation of supersymmetry     in a world still governed by string theory.\\
126 - Interesting. So you're taking the paradigms of supersymmetry,     but removing the limitations of obeying the Poincaré algebra.\\
127 - Well, aren't you just the pride of Bloomington?\\
128 -  What do you want, Sheldon?\\
129 -  Dr. Fowler has found herself distracted     by the commitments in her own lab.\\
130 - It would be a great help to both of us     if you could free her up from her other projects.\\
131 - I'm confused.\\
132 - Yeah, well, there's that Indiana.\\
133 - This is physics research. Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.\\
134 - Y-Yes,     but her insights into the very ways     we conceptualize symmetry and asymmetry have been invaluable.\\
135 - - Dr. Cooper... - L-Look, I know     what you're thinking, that "they're newlyweds,     how are they gonna keep their hands off of each other?"     Let me assure you, we will not engage in workplace coitus.\\
136 - Okay, if I won't put a bagel on my desk,     I'm certainly not putting Amy's bare bottom.\\
137 - I-I must say, I do not enjoy our talks.\\
138 - Dr. Park, may I help you?\\
139 -  Actually, yes, do you have any better notes on this project?\\
140 -  I'm having a hard time reading your handwriting.\\
141 - Oh, uh, allow me to rephrase that.\\
142 - What the hell are you doing in my lab?\\
143 -  I'm sorry, I was reassigned to this project.\\
144 - I was told you were taking     a temporary sabbatical     to focus on other work.\\
145 - N-No, that-that's crazy.\\
146 - This is my research.\\
147 - - Oh, Amy, there you are. - No, not...\\
148 - Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing with an epic screwup,     and when I find out who's responsible,     they're gonna get an earful.\\
149 - All right, well, when you're done, let me know,     I've got some exciting news.\\
150 - I'm sorry, I'm confused. President Siebert said     you were focusing on some important physics work     and I should take over your lab in the interim.\\
151 - Uh, hey, that was my exciting news.\\
152 - All right, I'm gonna tell you again.\\
153 - Pretend you haven't heard it.\\
154 - You got me removed from my own project?\\
155 -  Yeah, and it wasn't easy.\\
156 - Apparently, you're very difficult to replace.\\
157 - Hey, just between you and me,     they consider Dr. Park quite the step down.\\
158 - I was trying to pick my moment to leave. This seems like it.\\
159 - Wow. Banker's hours.\\
160 - No wonder you're not on the tenure track.\\
161 - Sheldon, you had no right.\\
162 - What-- I thought you said you were spread too thin.\\
163 - You said that you wished you had more time to focus     on our research. I thought I was helping.\\
164 - Well, you're not.\\
165 - I mean, I have years invested in this work,     and now someone's gonna come in and take it over?\\
166 -  I mean, how would you feel if I let Leonard take over     your super-asymmetry project?\\
167 -  (laughs)\\
168 - That's funny.\\
169 - Oh, he'd be like a puppy with a microscope. (laughs)\\
170 -  (chuckles)\\
171 -  If I had a nickel for every time a charity sent me a nickel.\\
172 - Really?\\
173 - That's gonna be our whole life, huh?\\
174 -  If my father's any guide, around   ,     I start to lose my hearing and get two new jokes.\\
175 - (knock on door)\\
176 -  - Hey. - Hey.\\
177 - I brought Chinese.\\
178 - Oh, that's a nice surprise. What's the occasion?\\
179 -  Please, I don't need a reason to bring food to my friends.\\
180 - But you have one, don't you?\\
181 -  Yeah, I need your help.\\
182 - All right, lay it on us.\\
183 - So, I folded,     and I told Howard he could be a part     of my planetarium show.\\
184 - And now I'm worried he's just gonna     make the whole thing about himself.\\
185 - So just tell him you changed your mind     and you don't want him to do it.\\
186 - No, no, then he's gonna think I'm too insecure     to share the spotlight with him.\\
187 - And he'd be right.\\
188 - I came here for your support.\\
189 - Well, then, you just walked up     three flights of stairs for nothing.\\
190 - Wait, don't you mean four flights?\\
191 -  No, it's actually three.\\
192 - But we're on the fourth floor.\\
193 - I mean, you have the lobby, first floor,     second, third, fourth.\\
194 - The lobby's the first floor,     so lobby, second, third, fourth.\\
195 - That does not seem right.\\
196 - Hello...\\
197 - Sorry, Raj, who cares if Howard tries to steal the show?\\
198 -  All right?\\
199 - You're great at what you do.\\
200 - Just be the bigger man.\\
201 - And if it makes you feel better, Penny and I will come     so you'll have a couple of friendly faces in the audience.\\
202 - Thank you. That would be nice.\\
203 - Can you just... Sorry, give me a minute?\\
204 -  Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel for every time     a charity sent me a nickel...\\
205 - That's hilarious!\\
206 -  I know.\\
207 - (exhales)\\
208 -  It's three, right?\\
209 -  Just shut up.\\
210 - Oh, good, we caught you.\\
211 - Yes, good.\\
212 - You had no right to reassign my project.\\
213 - Yeah, no right at all.\\
214 - Dr. Fowler, I don't understand.\\
215 - Dr. Cooper assured me this is what you wanted.\\
216 - Oh-oh!\\
217 - Can you believe this guy?\\
218 -  Oh, sure,     so a couple of men get together behind closed doors     to decide the fate of a woman's career.\\
219 - I thought we'd moved past this.\\
220 - Sheldon, this is your fault.\\
221 - Ooh, sounds like the old lady's     putting me in the doghouse tonight.\\
222 - Dr. Fowler,     you are very important to this university     and I would like to sincerely apologize.\\
223 - So I can have my project back?\\
224 -  - I'm afraid it's not that simple. - Why not?\\
225 -  Well, in order to free up personnel...\\
226 - Hey, hey, don't go mansplaining things to her.\\
227 - I don't think that's what he was doing.\\
228 - Oh, then perhaps you don't understand.\\
229 - See, mansplaining is when a man explains things     to a woman like she's stupid.\\
230 - Boop.\\
231 - So when was the last time     you saw Howard in his astronaut uniform?\\
232 -  About a week ago.\\
233 - Really?\\
234 - What was the occasion?\\
235 -  Date night.\\
236 - We do a little role-playing.\\
237 - What role do you play?\\
238 -  (Russian accent): I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,     lonely Russian cosmonaut who is expert at physics     and making love.\\
239 - Okay, that just made the next hour really weird.\\
240 - Good evening, I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,     and usually I take you on a trip through the stars,     but tonight, we'll begin our journey     much closer to home,     miles     straight up to the International Space Station,     which is manned by a team of brave men and women.\\
241 - (Russian accent): Flexible men and women.\\
242 - Switch with me.\\
243 - KOOTHRAPPALI: And we are fortunate     to have one of those men here with us tonight.\\
244 - Please welcome to the Griffith Observatory     astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.\\
245 - Kak horosho.     - What is she ta... - Don't ask.\\
246 - Thank you, Raj, that was a really nice introduction.\\
247 - Well, it's from my heart.\\
248 - So, Howard, you are in an elite group.\\
249 - Only     people have ever been on     the International Space Station. How does that     make you feel?\\
250 -  Honestly, lucky.\\
251 - Most astronauts have to train their whole lives.\\
252 - I was just in the right place at the right time.\\
253 - Oh, please, luck had nothing to do with it.\\
254 - You people need to know how impressive     this man is. He was up there     because he's the only one qualified     to install a piece of equipment that he designed.\\
255 - Thanks, but if you want to talk impressive,     this guy right here discovered a planetary object     outside the Kuiper belt.\\
256 - He worked on the Mars rover.\\
257 - He helped launch the New Horizons space probe.\\
258 - He went to space on a Russian rocket.\\
259 - And I was scared the whole time.\\
260 - And I was scared for you, but also proud.\\
261 - Wow.\\
262 - I don't think you've ever said that to me before.\\
263 - I should have,     and I'm gonna say it again.\\
264 - I'm proud of you.\\
265 - You're my best friend, and I love you.\\
266 - Aw, Raj, I love you, too.\\
267 - What is happening?\\
268 -  Bring it in, spaceman, you've been cleared for landing.\\
269 - - Can you believe these two... - (crying)\\
270 - - Are you crying?\\
271 -  Hello, Sheldon.\\
272 - Hello, Arthur.\\
273 - Now, I'm confused, usually when you appear to me in my dreams,     we're on the planet Dagobah.\\
274 - This is Dagobah.\\
275 - I didn't know that Dagobah had delicatessens.\\
276 - Not good ones.\\
277 - Whatever you do,     don't order the Reuben.\\
278 - I'm having a problem in my marriage.\\
279 - I've upset my wife and I don't know how to make it right.\\
280 - (chuckles)\\
281 - And you're... and you're coming to me for advice?\\
282 -  I-I upset my wife every time I woke up in the morning.\\
283 - I'm not coming to you,     you're just a manifestation of my subconscious.\\
284 - I mean, I'm actually coming to me.\\
285 - So you know everything I'm going to say.\\
286 - Yes, but it sounds wiser from you     because you're old and glowing.\\
287 - Fine.\\
288 - Rule number one in a marriage:     don't go to bed angry.\\
289 - That makes sense.\\
290 - Rule number two in a marriage:     if you don't recognize the shoes under your bed,     they're not your shoes.\\
291 - Because they're her shoes?\\
292 -  (sighs)\\
293 - N-Never mind,     just-just go with rule number one.\\
294 - Thank you, Arthur.\\
295 - Uh, before you go, can I ask you a question?\\
296 -  Of course.\\
297 - Does this look lean to you?\\
298 -  I ordered lean.\\
299 - Amy. Wake up. Amy.\\
300 - What?\\
301 - What's wrong?\\
302 -  We can't go to sleep angry with each other.\\
303 - Why not?\\
304 -  It's rule number one.\\
305 - I'd tell you rule number two, but it's confusing.\\
306 - Sheldon, go to sleep.\\
307 - Amy. Amy. Amy.\\
308 - You cut that out!\\
309 -  Oh, good, you're up.\\
310 - Sheldon...\\
311 - I just really don't want to talk to you about this right now.\\
312 - That's fine.\\
313 - I just need you to know     that I feel terrible about what I did     and I wasn't being malicious.\\
314 - No, you were being selfish.\\
315 - You're being selfish right now     'cause it's really late and I just want to sleep.\\
316 - No, Professor Proton came to me in my dream     and said we can't go to sleep angry.\\
317 - Are you sure that's what he said?\\
318 -  Close your eyes, double-check.\\
319 - Amy, this is important.\\
320 - Okay, listen to me.\\
321 - I love working with you,     but you have to understand how scary this is for me.\\
322 - Why?\\
323 -  Because I don't want to get lost in this relationship.\\
324 - And when you pulled me off my project,     it seemed like my biggest fear was coming true,     the-the things that are mine are getting subsumed     into the things that are ours.\\
325 - I wouldn't want that to happen, either.\\
326 - Thank you for explaining     and for using the word "subsume,"     that's one you don't hear enough.\\
327 - You're welcome.\\
328 - - Good night. - Good night.\\
329 - What are you doing now?\\
330 -  Looking for shoes.\\
331 - Why?\\
332 -  When your favorite ghost tells you to do something, you do it.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Imitation Perturbation}
1 - Hey, did you guys know this year's the   th anniversary of Halloween?\\
2 - - Oh, nonsense.  \\
3 - Halloween traditions of date back to the Celtic festival of Samhain.  \\
4 - Although our current Halloween customs come from the evening before All Hallows' Day--  \\
5 - All Hallows' Eve-- thus, Halloween.  \\
6 - I meant the movie Halloween. \\
7 - Oh.   \\
8 - Well, that's not interesting at all.   \\
9 - Did you know the Michael Myers mask from the film was actually a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out?   \\
10 - Okay, now it's interesting.   \\
11 - Are you guys all dressing up for work?   \\
12 - Of course.\\
13 - I mean, how often do you get to wear costumes to work?   \\
14 - Says the man with a giant belt buckle and a dickey.   \\
15 - Hey, this is not a costume.\\
16 - It's a choice. It's a style.   \\
17 - It's a tragedy.   \\
18 - Bernadette, why don't we get to dress up at work?   \\
19 - We used to, but a couple guys in the infectious disease lab went as zombies and it triggered a quarantine.   \\
20 - The CDC was so mad.   \\
21 - Hey, if you really want to dress up, we could throw a party.   \\
22 - Oh, that would be fun.   \\
23 - You know, I used to throw Halloween parties all the time when I moved into the building.   \\
24 - All the time? I only remember being invited to one.   \\
25 - Please don't make this awkward for me.   \\
26 - Okay, so, Friday night--   \\
27 - Halloween party here.\\
28 - - Okay.   \\
29 - Great. Can't wait.   \\
30 - What are you going as?   \\
31 - I don't want to ruin the surprise.   \\
32 - You'll see it at work.\\
33 - Just a warning: it's pretty scary.   \\
34 - - Is it a bird?\\
35 - - No.   \\
36 - - Is it a dog?\\
37 - - No.   \\
38 - Oh, I think I'll be fine, then.   \\
39 - Hello.   \\
40 - Hello.   \\
41 - I see you are dressed as Doc Brown from Back to the Future. \\
42 - May I assume that Amy is going as his wife, Clara Clayton, from Back to the Future\\
43 - Part III? \\
44 - She is.   \\
45 - Did you do something different to your hair?   \\
46 - Yes.   \\
47 - Looking good.   \\
48 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
49 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
50 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
51 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
52 -  We built the Wall \\
53 -  We built the pyramids    \\
54 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
55 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
56 -  Bang!    \\
57 - Oh, Inspector Gadget.   \\
58 - And I want to say Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   \\
59 - So close.   \\
60 - Kooth Bader Ginsburg.\\
61 - (chuckles)   \\
62 - The Notorious KBG.   \\
63 - That's very clever.   \\
64 - Sustained.   \\
65 - Are you gonna dress in drag in front of your fiancée?   \\
66 - Yeah. We have no secrets from each other.   \\
67 - Well, except for the fact that I-I crocheted this myself.   \\
68 - Hey, Sheldon.   \\
69 - - Hello.\\
70 - - Hello.   \\
71 - Oh, my God, you look amazing.   \\
72 - KOOTHRAPPALI: I find you guilty of murder, because you are killing it.   \\
73 - (imitating Sheldon):\\
74 - Well, technically, the Supreme Court wouldn't determine a defendant's guilt or innocence in a criminal matter.   \\
75 - They could only reverse or revamp a jury's conviction based on a constitutional or statutory issue.   \\
76 - (both laughing)   \\
77 - Why are you laughing?   \\
78 - His statement was factually correct.   \\
79 - (both laughing)   \\
80 - You're sitting in my spot.   \\
81 - You don't have a spot.   \\
82 - - What is wrong with you today?\\
83 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Maybe he's cranky because he's off his bathroom schedule.   \\
84 - Well, I can understand how that would make someone irritable.   \\
85 - Interesting fact: "irritable" comes from the Latin, "susceptible to anger."   \\
86 - Just because I used a word doesn't mean I want its etymology.   \\
87 - Interesting fact: "etymology" comes from the Greek word...   \\
88 - You are being so annoying.\\
89 - Stop it.   \\
90 - And why are you two laughing?   \\
91 - (chuckles)\\
92 - Sheldon, he's being you.    \\
93 - He's dressed as you for Halloween.    \\
94 - Oh.    \\
95 - So you're not laughing at him.    \\
96 - You're laughing at me.    \\
97 - We're not laughing at you.    \\
98 - We're laughing with you.    \\
99 - But I'm not laughing.    \\
100 - Then the first one.    \\
101 - (footsteps approaching)    \\
102 - Ready to go?    \\
103 - Hey, why aren't you in your costume?    \\
104 - I just didn't feel like it.    \\
105 - You get that I'm wearing a corset because of you, not because I'm tired of breathing?    \\
106 - Amy, do you think I'm always correcting other people?    \\
107 - No, not all the time. I mean, just last week, Penny ended a sentence with a preposition.    \\
108 - You didn't even mention it.    \\
109 - True.    \\
110 - I just waited until I got home and screamed into a pillow.    \\
111 - Is something bothering you?    \\
112 - Howard dressed up as me and imitated me, and everyone laughed.    \\
113 - Oh. Well, that must have felt terrible.    \\
114 - It did. I never realized my friends viewed me as an object of ridicule.    \\
115 - Oh, I don't think that's true.    \\
116 - They laughed, Amy.    \\
117 - In a derisive way.\\
118 - Not in the instructive way I laugh at them when they're being stupid.    \\
119 - - Hey, happy Halloween.\\
120 - - Oh!    \\
121 - - Trick or treat.\\
122 - - No.    \\
123 - Sorry, you're not wearing a costume.    \\
124 - Yeah, I am.\\
125 - I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.    \\
126 - I'm gonna need more.    \\
127 - Okay, failed actress who traded constant rejection for a Christmas bonus and a dental plan?    \\
128 - - Go nuts.\\
129 - - Oh.    \\
130 - I will.    \\
131 - So, what are you wearing to the party?    \\
132 - Sexy cat? Sexy nurse?\\
133 - Sexy zombie?    \\
134 - Why do girls' costumes have to be sexy but guys' costumes don't?    \\
135 - (scoffs) Say that again with this helicopter on my head.    \\
136 - Very cute.    \\
137 - Hey, do you remember what happened at that first Halloween party that you invited me to?    \\
138 - When I threw up in the pumpkin?    \\
139 - More memorable than that.    \\
140 - (chuckles): Really?\\
141 - That was pretty impressive.    \\
142 - We had our first kiss.    \\
143 - On this very couch.    \\
144 - No, no, our first kiss was at your birthday.    \\
145 - Remember? I threw you a party, you didn't make it, and I felt bad for you.    \\
146 - No, no, it was on Halloween, and you felt bad for me.    \\
147 - If we're gonna go through every party where I felt bad for you, we're gonna be here awhile.    \\
148 - Never mind.    \\
149 - What? You're not mad at me, are you?    \\
150 - No.    \\
151 - Of course not.\\
152 - No, we just remember different things from that party.    \\
153 - I remember falling in love, and you remember vomiting in a pumpkin.    \\
154 - I was, like, four feet away.    \\
155 - People cheered.    \\
156 - - Here you go.\\
157 - - Thanks.    \\
158 - So, did you see Howard's costume?    \\
159 - See it? I made it.\\
160 - It was hilarious.    \\
161 - Well, Sheldon didn't think so, and neither did I.    \\
162 - Oh, come on.\\
163 - It was all in good fun.    \\
164 - Well, I'm sure it was, but Sheldon's feelings got hurt.    \\
165 - M-Maybe Howard could apologize?    \\
166 - You're kidding, right?    \\
167 - Sheldon didn't apologize when he said my baby looked like Winston Churchill.    \\
168 - He loves Churchill.    \\
169 - Your son should take that as a compliment.    \\
170 - He said it about my daughter.    \\
171 - Well, this isn't about Sheldon.    \\
172 - This is about Howard.    \\
173 - I think it is about Sheldon.    \\
174 - How many times has he made fun of Howard for being an engineer?    \\
175 - Going to MIT? His magic?    \\
176 - Sheldon doesn't make fun of his magic.    \\
177 - Well, he should. It's stupid.    \\
178 - Anyway, the point is, Sheldon shouldn't dish it out if he can't take it.    \\
179 - I think the point is that Howard owes him an apology.    \\
180 - Yeah, well, I think the point is if Sheldon has a problem with Howard,    \\
181 - Sheldon should take it up with him.    \\
182 - HALLEY (over monitor): Mama.    \\
183 - Now, if you'll excuse me, the prime minister of England needs her diaper changed.    \\
184 - KOOTHRAPPALI:\\
185 - Hey.    \\
186 - LEONARD: Oh, that's great.    \\
187 - He's a Supreme Court justice, and you're the U.S. Constitution.    \\
188 - Yep. He interprets me.    \\
189 - And guess what's underneath this?    \\
190 - The Bill of Tights.    \\
191 - Smart, funny, gorgeous-- are we a match or what?    \\
192 - Hey, Bert, what are you dressed as?    \\
193 - I'll give you a hint.    \\
194 - My work in seismic refraction measurements and...    \\
195 - Hey, Stuart, what are you dressed as?    \\
196 - I'm a butterfly.    \\
197 - Did you steal those from Halley's "let's pretend" box?    \\
198 - I'm gonna put them back.    \\
199 - All right, I'll tell you.    \\
200 - I'm Maurice "Doc" Ewing, winner of the      Vetlesen Prize, generally regarded as the Nobel Prize of geology.    \\
201 - Oh, yeah. Now I see it.    \\
202 - Ask me how I died.    \\
203 - Spoiler alert: brain hemorrhage.    \\
204 - (Cockney accent): Well, Gorblimey.    \\
205 - You look like a thousand tuppence.    \\
206 - Don't he, Mary Poppins?    \\
207 - Are you gonna talk like that all night?    \\
208 - Jiff willikers, I am.    \\
209 - Isn't he cute?    \\
210 - He's gonna get a spoonful of sugar later.    \\
211 - And I'm gonna sweep Ms. Poppins' chimney.    \\
212 - (honks)    \\
213 - So, here we are.    \\
214 - On Halloween.\\
215 - On this couch.    \\
216 - Does it ring any bells?    \\
217 - Really? We're still doing this?    \\
218 - I'm just surprised you don't remember our first kiss.    \\
219 - (sighs) Fine.\\
220 - It was on Halloween.    \\
221 - Are you agreeing just to shut me up?    \\
222 - You got another way?\\
223 - I'm all ears.    \\
224 - - Really? An arranged marriage?\\
225 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah.    \\
226 - I know how it sounds.    \\
227 - It sounds awesome.    \\
228 - Is that just an Indian thing, or can I get a piece of that?    \\
229 - You know the woman has a choice, right?    \\
230 - There's always a catch.    \\
231 - (imitating Bernadette):\\
232 - Happy Halloween.    \\
233 - Who wants to see a magic trick?    \\
234 - Oh, that's right.\\
235 - No one.    \\
236 - Ha! They're you.    \\
237 - What do you think you're doing?    \\
238 - I thought it was clear.    \\
239 - I'm being unnecessarily hurtful but with a sweet voice.    \\
240 - And I don't understand what's going on because I went to MIT.    \\
241 - Okay, guys, I think that's enough.    \\
242 - Hold on. I'm the judge here, and I'm going to allow it.    \\
243 - Raj, take a break.    \\
244 - Hey, free speech.    \\
245 - Right back there somewhere.    \\
246 - WOLOWITZ: You know what, guys?    \\
247 - You got us. Congratulations.\\
248 - Now why don't you go back to your apartment and put on your other costumes.    \\
249 - Oh, but it's so far away, and I have such teeny, tiny legs.    \\
250 - Really? Our bodies?\\
251 - Is that where we're going, Amy?    \\
252 - (normal voice): What's wrong with my body?    \\
253 - Well, for starters, you have a quarter in your nose.    \\
254 - AMY: Not now, Sheldon.    \\
255 - I don't get invited to a lot of parties.    \\
256 - Is this a good one?    \\
257 - Oh, yeah.    \\
258 - Did that guacamole taste weird to you?    \\
259 - Tasted weird to me.    \\
260 - Can't believe Amy did that.    \\
261 - Oh, come on.\\
262 - You thought it was funny when I dressed up as Sheldon.    \\
263 - That was totally different.    \\
264 - - How?\\
265 - - That didn't hurt my feelings.    \\
266 - Well, for what it's worth, I didn't think it was a very good impression of you.    \\
267 - Really? You don't think I have an annoying high-pitched voice?    \\
268 - No, not at all.    \\
269 - In fact, I find your voice quite melodious.    \\
270 - Mm-hmm. And you don't think I'm unnecessarily hurtful?    \\
271 - What? I'm sorry.    \\
272 - I-I couldn't hear the question.\\
273 - I just heard the music.    \\
274 - Well, people came, they ate, they vowed to never speak to each other again.    \\
275 - I think it was a successful party.    \\
276 - It was.\\
277 - And I'm sorry about earlier.    \\
278 - I know it doesn't matter.    \\
279 - (sighs) No, it does matter.    \\
280 - Okay? You were right.    \\
281 - It was Halloween.    \\
282 - I was dressed as a cat, you were a hobbit.    \\
283 - It was right there on that couch.    \\
284 - Why didn't you just say that?    \\
285 - Because I always hated that was our first kiss.    \\
286 - I was drunk, and I was still with Kurt, and I was using you to make myself feel better.    \\
287 - I... just wanted our first kiss to mean something.    \\
288 - That's why I said it was the one on your birthday.    \\
289 - I like that.    \\
290 - We'll make that our official first kiss.    \\
291 - Thank you. Aw.\\
292 - (giggles)    \\
293 - That was beautiful.    \\
294 - - Mm.\\
295 - - What are you still doing here?    \\
296 - I was in the bathroom.    \\
297 - Guacamole didn't agree with me.    \\
298 - Well, since you're here, you can help us clean up.    \\
299 - Will you take this out, please?\\
300 - Sure.    \\
301 - Thank you.    \\
302 - It's late. Would you mind if I crashed here tonight?    \\
303 - You are always welcome here.    \\
304 - - Thank you.\\
305 - - Mm-hmm.    \\
306 - Where were we?    \\
307 - I think Howard hurting my feelings has in some ways made me a better person.    \\
308 - Hmm. Look at you, improving on perfection.    \\
309 - How so?    \\
310 - As you were eating that Danish, I wanted to point out that the Danish isn't Danish at all.    \\
311 - It was imported by Austrian bakers during a labor dispute in the     s.    \\
312 - But I chose not to, because I didn't want to be the kind of fella who foists unwanted facts about European pastries on the unwilling.    \\
313 - Huh. That's actually interesting.    \\
314 - Sorry. Now you'll never know.    \\
315 - Hey, guys, I need your help.    \\
316 - (chuckles):\\
317 - Bernadette's still pretty upset about your costumes.    \\
318 - She's upset?    \\
319 - Those pants I wore to make fun of you were so tight, I risked a testicular hernia.    \\
320 - Anyway, if you guys could apologize, it'd be a big help.    \\
321 - Oh, we'd be happy to apologize to her as soon as she apologizes to me for not making you apologize to Sheldon.    \\
322 - I didn't follow that, but, then, between my wife and that guacamole, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.    \\
323 - Don't you think it's unreasonable for her to ask us to do something she refused to do?    \\
324 - Yes. So when can you stop by? (chuckles)    \\
325 - I don't understand. If it's unreasonable, why should we do it?    \\
326 - Okay, how about this?\\
327 - You know in Star Wars when R  and Chewbacca were playing holochess?    \\
328 - Really? Star Wars? \\
329 - Amy, let the man speak.    \\
330 - WOLOWITZ: Well, Chewbacca was losing and getting angry and...    \\
331 - W-W-Wait. Are you saying we should let the Wookiee win?    \\
332 - (chuckles):\\
333 - Hey.    \\
334 - Hey, that's my wife you're talking about.    \\
335 - (whispers):\\
336 - But yes, let the Wookiee win.    \\
337 - Hello, Bernadette.    \\
338 - Wait, did you just walk into my house?    \\
339 - No, Howard let me in.    \\
340 - Where is he?    \\
341 - Oh, he got in his car and drove away.    \\
342 - Oh.    \\
343 - Is that watermelon for anybody?    \\
344 - - It's for Halley.\\
345 - - Is she gonna eat all of it?    \\
346 - God, no wonder she looks like Churchill.    \\
347 - What do you want, Sheldon?    \\
348 - Howard said your feelings were hurt.    \\
349 - Well, Howard's wrong.\\
350 - I don't care if someone makes fun of me.    \\
351 - All right.    \\
352 - Apparently I came all this way for nothing.    \\
353 - Unless Halley wants to share that watermelon?    \\
354 - You think Amy's the first person to make fun of me for having a squeaky voice?    \\
355 - Do you?    \\
356 - I feel like my chance at watermelon is dangling by a thread.    \\
357 - She's not. It's been happening my whole life.    \\
358 - And-and she called me out for being mean?    \\
359 - Well, I've had to be mean.    \\
360 - It's hard to be taken seriously when you're always the smallest person in the room.    \\
361 - I know that.    \\
362 - I was in high school when I was nine years old.    \\
363 - I tried to tell the other kids that although my physical stature was small, my intellectual stature towered over them.    \\
364 - That only seemed to make things worse.    \\
365 - The kids called me Bernadette the marionette.    \\
366 - (laughs): Because you're small.\\
367 - That's funny.    \\
368 - No, it's not.    \\
369 - Well, people used to call me egghead 'cause there were eggs on my head.    \\
370 - 'Cause they threw them at me.    \\
371 - That's terrible.    \\
372 - One time my brothers made me breathe helium.    \\
373 - I tried to call for help, but the only one who could hear me was the dog.    \\
374 - That's also terrible.    \\
375 - My goodness, you had to live in a house with a dog.    \\
376 - I guess we both had to put up with a lot of crap from people.    \\
377 - I suppose we have. Huh.    \\
378 - Maybe you and I are more alike than we thought.    \\
379 - Maybe we are.    \\
380 - Although I'm exceptionally tall, and you're exceptionally...    \\
381 - - Sheldon.\\
382 - - You didn't even let me finish.    \\
383 - - Fine. Sorry.\\
384 - - Short.    \\
385 - Sheldon, you sure you're ready for this?    \\
386 - - This movie's pretty scary.\\
387 - - Please.    \\
388 - I'm an adult.\\
389 - I think I can handle it.    \\
390 - That's what you said about the butterfly pavilion at the zoo.    \\
391 - That was my fault.\\
392 - After I pet that goat, I felt like a gladiator.    \\
393 - Okay, lights on, or lights off?    \\
394 - Lights off. If I'm gonna do this, I want to do it right.    \\
395 - (Halloween theme playing)    \\
396 - What do you guys think you're doing?    \\
397 - We're showing Sheldon Halloween. \\
398 - Absolutely not.\\
399 - Sheldon, come home.    \\
400 - (stammers)    \\
401 - But I really want to watch it.    \\
402 - I know you do, but I am forbidding it.    \\
403 - Oh, man. Sorry, guys.    \\
404 - - What took you so long?\\
405 - - I'm sorry. I just got your text!
\subsection {Episode 07: The Grant Allocation Derivation}
1 - Oh, this is amazing.  \\
2 - I wish I had a playhouse like this when I was a kid.  \\
3 - Really? You never had a playhouse?  \\
4 - No. I mean, my dad did buy the house next door for us to play in.  \\
5 - I'm gonna hook up the garden hose, so it has running water.  \\
6 - Why does it need running water?  \\
7 - Same reason it's got electricity: Bernadette and I both work, and we're overcompensating.   \\
8 - This reminds me of a traditional Amish barn raising.   \\
9 - With everyone pitching in.   \\
10 - How exactly are you pitching in?   \\
11 - I don't hear anyone else giving facts about traditional Amish barn raising.   \\
12 - The rest of us are pitching in with hammers and nails.   \\
13 - Well, facts are my nails, and my voice is the hammer which pounds them through the wood of your skull.   \\
14 - Well, that is how it feels.   \\
15 - Hey, uh, can you pass me that drill?   \\
16 - Yeah, fun fact about Amish barn raising-- they don't use any power tools.   \\
17 - - Amy, make him stop.\\
18 - - No.   \\
19 - If he tires himself out now, he'll sleep better tonight.   \\
20 - BERNADETTE: Hey, Howie, can you give me a hand?   \\
21 - I need to get some work done, and the kids are climbing all over me.   \\
22 - You know what?\\
23 - I'll watch them.   \\
24 - - You sure?\\
25 - - But I was just about to tell everyone why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch when they really hail from Germany.   \\
26 - Yep.   \\
27 - Thanks.   \\
28 - So, what do you think?\\
29 - Pretty cool, huh?   \\
30 - And when our kids outgrow it, we can Airbnb it to other people's babies.   \\
31 - Funny.   \\
32 - You all right?   \\
33 - Sorry, I haven't had a second to myself.   \\
34 - So let me just go back inside, finish my report, brush my teeth, change out of my pajamas, make a sandwich, and then I'll come out here and laugh at your joke.   \\
35 - Ooh. As long as you're making sandwiches...   \\
36 - You can laugh at that one later, too.   \\
37 - All right, I've kept you in suspense long enough.   \\
38 - "Dutch" is a bastardization of the word "Deutsch," meaning German.   \\
39 - What's German for "annoying"?   \\
40 - Nervig. Why do you ask?   \\
41 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
42 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
43 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
44 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
45 -  We built the Wall \\
46 -  We built the pyramids    \\
47 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
48 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
49 -  Bang!    \\
50 - (knocks) President Siebert, you wanted to see me?   \\
51 - Hey. There's my guy!   \\
52 - You sound like my wife just before she asked me to go to Coachella.   \\
53 - No, this is gonna be way more fun than Coachella.   \\
54 - More fun than heatstroke?\\
55 - Good luck.   \\
56 - So, there are some funds left in the general administrative grant, and I need somebody to decide how we should disburse them.   \\
57 - Really?   \\
58 - W-Wow, what an honor.\\
59 - Thank you.   \\
60 - So how do I decide who gets the money?   \\
61 - How do you decide anything?   \\
62 - Think about it with your brain, and then say it with your mouth.   \\
63 - Yeah, right, sure.   \\
64 - Uh, so, after I decide, do I then submit it to you for approval, or...?   \\
65 - No. You decide, you approve, and then you pride yourself on a job well done.   \\
66 - That's a lot of responsibility.   \\
67 - Well, if I didn't think you were up to the task, you wouldn't have been fifth on my list.   \\
68 - Thank you.\\
69 - I-I'll get started right away.   \\
70 - And I look forward to hearing nothing about it.   \\
71 - I will keep you posted.   \\
72 - Hey, thank you guys again for helping out yesterday.\\
73 - - No problem.   \\
74 - - That was really fun.\\
75 - - It was fun.   \\
76 - But I am sore.   \\
77 - You didn't lift a finger.   \\
78 - No, but I narrated the entire event, and I am paying for it today.   \\
79 - - Gentlemen.\\
80 - - Hey. - Hi.   \\
81 - Leonard, do I detect a little swagger in your step?   \\
82 - Mm, possibly.   \\
83 - Well, stop.\\
84 - It doesn't suit you.   \\
85 - - What's going on?\\
86 - - Well,   \\
87 - Siebert put me in charge of handing out the last bit of the administrative funds, and I have sole discretion.   \\
88 - Ooh! Looks like Christmas came early.    \\
89 - First thing on my list is a golden umbrella,  'cause Leonard's gonna make it rain!    \\
90 - Uh, hold on, I'm not just gonna hand out money.    \\
91 - There's a procedure you need to follow.    \\
92 - I believe he's referring to the traditional "kissing of the buttocks."    \\
93 - Should we form a line, or just do it like we're bobbing for apples?    \\
94 - LEONARD: Cute, but President Siebert trusted me with this, and I'm taking it seriously.    \\
95 - If you have a legitimate request, you can submit it to me in writing, and I'll evaluate it based on its merits.    \\
96 - Sure, sure. Is "Jet Ski" one word or two?    \\
97 - Hofstadter!    \\
98 - Heard Siebert put you in charge of the administrative fund.    \\
99 - Can't think of a better guy for the job.    \\
100 - I think he's done this before.    \\
101 - Leonard, I know you and I have a... oh, troubled history, but I hope that when I make my request you'll give me a fair shot.    \\
102 - Of course.    \\
103 - See? That's why I like about this guy: integrity.    \\
104 - Bring it in!    \\
105 - I just put something in your pocket.    \\
106 - It's good at all El Pollo Locos.    \\
107 - (Neil crying)    \\
108 - WOLOWITZ: Halley, leave your brother's dirty diaper alone.    \\
109 - Put that down.\\
110 - That is not a hat.    \\
111 - That is not a hat! Oh!    \\
112 - (crying continues)    \\
113 - - Okay. Everybody in the sink.\\
114 - - Oh.    \\
115 - Bad news, Howie.    \\
116 - I'm gonna be stuck at work for a while.    \\
117 - Oh, that's terrible.\\
118 - Hang in there.    \\
119 - I'll be home as soon as I can.    \\
120 - (sighs):\\
121 - Ah...    \\
122 - He deserves better.    \\
123 - No, I'm not going to reconsider.    \\
124 - Your request was denied.    \\
125 - I don't care if it helps you think; you don't need a koi pond in your office.    \\
126 - Well, you should have thought about that before you bought the koi!    \\
127 - Wow. That was a little rough.    \\
128 - Well, I have to be.    \\
129 - Everyone assumes I'm just gonna give them whatever they want.    \\
130 - Hmm. But you're not, are you?    \\
131 - No, I'm not.    \\
132 - I mean, look at this.    \\
133 - An espresso machine? I don't think so. Denied!    \\
134 - Wow, I really like this side of you.    \\
135 - Really?    \\
136 - Yeah, just so decisive.    \\
137 - Well, check this out.    \\
138 - A standing desk. Denied!    \\
139 - Oh!    \\
140 - If you want to stand, do it on your own time, 'cause I'm the boss.    \\
141 - Yeah, you are.    \\
142 - - Hello.\\
143 - - Hey. - Hey.    \\
144 - Leonard, I just wanted to congratulate you on how well you are managing this grant money.\\
145 - - What do you want?    \\
146 - Nothing. I just came by to pay you a compliment.    \\
147 - Nice try.\\
148 - The answer's no.    \\
149 - To what? I'm not asking you for anything.    \\
150 - All I need for my job is right here. Hmm?    \\
151 - This is my office.\\
152 - Which makes for a great commute.    \\
153 - Home, work, home.    \\
154 - I'm still working--\\
155 - I'm just working from home.    \\
156 - You know, if it's that easy, then why does Leonard have to drive you to work every day?    \\
157 - Because I like the frozen yogurt machine in the cafeteria.    \\
158 - Ooh, I suppose I could use a frozen yogurt machine...    \\
159 - Denied!    \\
160 - Oh, you should have seen him-- denying things left and right.    \\
161 - It was so sexy.    \\
162 - 'Course, I made a request he did not deny.    \\
163 - Uh-huh.    \\
164 - Are you listening to me?    \\
165 - Yeah, sure.\\
166 - You slept with your husband.    \\
167 - What is going on with you?    \\
168 - It's not a big thing.    \\
169 - Have you ever told Leonard a little white lie?    \\
170 - Mm. Well, he thinks I've seen every one of the Star Wars movies, but I've really only seen the one with the gold robot.    \\
171 - - That could be any of them.\\
172 - - Exactly.    \\
173 - I've been telling Howie that I've had to work late the past couple nights, but really, I've just been hiding out in Howie's playhouse.    \\
174 - Does that make me awful?    \\
175 - Awful? No.    \\
176 - Uh, strange? Yes.    \\
177 - Sad? A little, yes.    \\
178 - It's just that work's been crazy, and the minute I get home, I have two kids hanging on me, and sometimes I don't want babies pulling my hair and pinching my belly fat.    \\
179 - That'd be a good slogan for a condom company.    \\
180 - I love my kids, but that hour to myself just makes me feel human again.    \\
181 - So, you go home and sit alone in a toy house    \\
182 - in the backyard?    \\
183 - Yeah!    \\
184 - Oh, Dr. Hofstadter, did you have a chance to look over my proposal?\\
185 - - I did, and your research is fascinating.    \\
186 - I had no idea that crows were that smart.    \\
187 - Do they really hold grudges?    \\
188 - They do. One of them escaped from my behavioral study a year ago.    \\
189 - I can't prove it's him, but something craps on my car every day.    \\
190 - Well, l-look, I only have enough money to fund one request, but your project is definitely in the running.    \\
191 - Okay, but, uh, when do you think you might make a decision?    \\
192 - Because I have to upgrade their cages before they learn how to open the locks.    \\
193 - When I came in to my lab this morning, they suddenly got silent.    \\
194 - I think they're planning something.    \\
195 - Um, soon. I've narrowed it down to three projects.    \\
196 - Ooh, is mine one of them?    \\
197 - Actually, yeah.    \\
198 - The software in the telescope room hasn't been upgraded in years, and it seems like it might be time.    \\
199 - - Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
200 - - (chuckles)    \\
201 - So you're just gonna give the money to your friend?    \\
202 - I smell a rat.    \\
203 - I work with rats, too.    \\
204 - That might be me.    \\
205 - I'm not just giving it to my friend, Barry.    \\
206 - Your proposal is also in the mix.    \\
207 - Wait, so those are the three?    \\
208 - You're not even considering mine?    \\
209 - Why, because they're PhDs and I'm just an engineer?    \\
210 - No, because they wrote detailed proposals, and you sent a YouTube clip of the guy from Jerry Maguire saying, "Show me the money!"    \\
211 - KRIPKE: All right, Hofstadter, what's it gonna be?    \\
212 - Which project are you gonna pick?    \\
213 - Yeah, come on, Leonard.    \\
214 - - Tell us now.\\
215 - LEE: But, remember, crows aren't the only ones who can hold a grudge.    \\
216 - Look, all three of your proposals have a lot of merit.    \\
217 - I just want to make sure I'm making the right decision.    \\
218 - I can tell you're stressed.    \\
219 - If it helps, I withdraw my proposal.    \\
220 - It doesn't help.    \\
221 - Fine. Then I'm back in the mix.    \\
222 - Show me the money!    \\
223 - Okay, I-I just--    \\
224 - I need everyone to back off.    \\
225 - I'm in charge here, and I'll decide when I'm ready to decide.    \\
226 - - When will that be?\\
227 - - (groans)    \\
228 - A day, a week.\\
229 - I don't know!    \\
230 - - Where are you going?\\
231 - - I don't know that either!    \\
232 - Ooh.    \\
233 - Someone's making decisions.    \\
234 - I'm reviewing these proposals.    \\
235 - Yeah. 'Cause you're the boss man,telling people what's what.    \\
236 - I like it.    \\
237 - (whining):\\
238 - It's just so hard!    \\
239 - All-all three of these proposals have merit.    \\
240 - How do I choose?    \\
241 - Well, not with that voice.    \\
242 - There has got to be a right decision based on empirical evidence.    \\
243 - Look, I made pros and cons lists, and then I came up with three different scoring systems to determine the best project.    \\
244 - I just don't know what scoring system to use.    \\
245 - So I'm working on a meta-scoring system to score the scoring systems, but the math is really complicated.    \\
246 - You want me to walk you through it?    \\
247 - - Cheers.\\
248 - - Cheers.    \\
249 - (sighs)    \\
250 - Turn that off.\\
251 - Are you trying to get us caught?    \\
252 - Oh.    \\
253 - So, I've narrowed it down to three worthwhile projects,but I only have the money to fund one of them.    \\
254 - Lucky for you, I have a solution.    \\
255 - I can't wait.    \\
256 - You free up more money and I fund all of them.    \\
257 - Mm, no.    \\
258 - Or-- hear me out--    \\
259 - yes.    \\
260 - That way, e-everybody's happy.    \\
261 - You can't make everybody happy.    \\
262 - - I think I can.\\
263 - - You can't.    \\
264 - - Well, actually...\\
265 - - You're making me unhappy.    \\
266 - Okay, what would you do?    \\
267 - I'd find some sap and put him in charge so I wouldn't have to be the bad guy.    \\
268 - That's a really good id-- Oh.    \\
269 - (gasps)    \\
270 - Whatcha doin'?    \\
271 - You scared me.\\
272 - (chuckles)    \\
273 - I'll ask again.    \\
274 - What-cha doin'?    \\
275 - Nothing.    \\
276 - Really?    \\
277 - You and Bernadette aren't doing stuff without me?    \\
278 - What? No!\\
279 - Why would you even say that?    \\
280 - You know how your talent is getting just drunk enough to have a good time without being hungover the next day?    \\
281 - Thank you.\\
282 - (chuckles)    \\
283 - Well, mine is knowing when I'm being excluded.    \\
284 - So spill.    \\
285 - I'm-I'm just running some errands.    \\
286 - Yeah?    \\
287 - With a bag full of wine?\\
288 - I...    \\
289 - Got to stay hydrated.    \\
290 - Try again.    \\
291 - Okay, look, I'm sorry.    \\
292 - We did not mean to leave you out.    \\
293 - All right? Bernadette has been feeling fried at home, so we ended up hanging out in Halley's playhouse.    \\
294 - Like a secret club?    \\
295 - No! Just, like, a place to spend time that we don't tell anyone else about.    \\
296 - And what would be a shorter way of saying that?    \\
297 - (quietly):\\
298 - Secret club.    \\
299 - - Well, you really hurt my feelings.\\
300 - - (sighs)    \\
301 - What can I do to make it up to you?    \\
302 - I'm in a secret club!    \\
303 - Shh!    \\
304 - Is there some sort of humiliating initiation?    \\
305 - 'Cause I would literally do anything.    \\
306 - Leonard, you've been losing to me in three-dimensional chess for many years.    \\
307 - You know what would be neat?    \\
308 - If this was some sort of long con and one day you say, "Let's make this interesting," put money on it, and reveal that you actually know what you're doing.    \\
309 - A very long con indeed.    \\
310 - - Checkmate.\\
311 - - (groans)    \\
312 - Sorry. I'm distracted.    \\
313 - Ooh, aren't you the hustler.    \\
314 - No matter who I give the funds to, someone is gonna be upset with me.    \\
315 - Do you really care if people are angry at you?    \\
316 - - Of course.\\
317 - - Interesting.    \\
318 - Why don't you go to the store and get me some tapioca pudding or I'm gonna be angry at you.    \\
319 - No.    \\
320 - So it comes and goes?    \\
321 - How do you not care what people think of you?    \\
322 - It's easy.    \\
323 - I mean, not "beating you at chess" easy, but what is?    \\
324 - Wait, you can make this decision.    \\
325 - You don't care if you upset people.    \\
326 - You can pick for me.    \\
327 - I certainly could.    \\
328 - - Oh, great.\\
329 - - But I won't.    \\
330 - I think this is a learning opportunity for you.    \\
331 - Sheldon, come on.    \\
332 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
333 - Did I upset you?    \\
334 - - Yes.\\
335 - - Ask me how I feel about that.    \\
336 - So where does Leonard think you are?    \\
337 - Oh, I told him I was at yoga.    \\
338 - (chuckles) Well, you are stretching the truth.    \\
339 - Yeah. Where does Sheldon think you are?    \\
340 - Oh, Sheldon's kind of like a dog-- he doesn't really think about me when I'm gone, but he's so happy when I show up.    \\
341 - (oven dings)\\
342 - Ooh.    \\
343 - Who wants an Easy-Bake quesadilla?    \\
344 - Me!    \\
345 - Ooh, hot.    \\
346 - (door closes)\\
347 - Shh.    \\
348 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Thanks for letting me come over and hang.    \\
349 - So Leonard still hasn't made a decision yet?    \\
350 - No.    \\
351 - And I've really been laying on the guilt.    \\
352 - Did you break out the sad eyes?    \\
353 - You mean these bad boys?    \\
354 - (whispering): What do we do?    \\
355 - We're just gonna have to wait till they go back inside.    \\
356 - Okay, okay. Can we very quietly open that second bottle of...    \\
357 - (oven dings)    \\
358 - (quietly): Hey, don't freak out, but I think there's someone in your playhouse.    \\
359 - Oh. Yeah, that's just Bernadette.    \\
360 - She's been hiding out in there all week. (chuckles)    \\
361 - Really? Why?    \\
362 - (exhales)\\
363 - I don't know.    \\
364 - She's been a little overwhelmed at work.    \\
365 - And, frankly, me and the kids are a lot.    \\
366 - She just... (chuckles)\\
367 - needs some downtime.    \\
368 - And you just pretend like you don't know?    \\
369 - Sure. That's how marriage works.    \\
370 - Three years ago...\\
371 - (chuckles)    \\
372 - I told her I got life insurance, and I totally didn't.    \\
373 - (laughs)    \\
374 - Someday, she's gonna find out. I'm gonna say, "Ha-ha! I know you've been hiding in the playhouse."    \\
375 - Why don't you just get the life insurance?    \\
376 - Whose side are you on?    \\
377 - Can you hear what they're saying?    \\
378 - Shh, I'm trying.    \\
379 - (cork pops)    \\
380 - Huh.    \\
381 - Sounds like Penny's in there, too.    \\
382 - Seriously, Leonard, you didn't pick my project?    \\
383 - I'm sorry, Raj.    \\
384 - - Did you go with Crow Lady?\\
385 - - No.    \\
386 - You gave the money to Kripke?    \\
387 - I did not.    \\
388 - Wait, I'm confused.    \\
389 - I thought there were only three projects in contention.    \\
390 - There were.\\
391 - But, at the last minute, someone submitted an application for a pretty cool europium-doped laser, and they made a very compelling case.    \\
392 - What was the case?    \\
393 - Oh, that it was me and I wanted it.    \\
394 - You-you can't do that.    \\
395 - You can't just fund your own project.    \\
396 - Uh, it turns out I can, and I did.    \\
397 - Interesting.    \\
398 - What about not wanting everybody to be mad at you?    \\
399 - Well, I realized that, no matter what decision I made, people were gonna be mad at me.    \\
400 - And this way, I get a laser.    \\
401 - That is the most selfish thing you've ever done.    \\
402 - I'm proud of you.    \\
403 - - And I don't care.\\
404 - - Yes, you do.    \\
405 - Yeah, I do.    \\
406 - The europium laser is so cool.    \\
407 - It has a four-level f-f transition which provides for high power output, and its quantum efficiency is off the charts.    \\
408 - What are you going to use it for?    \\
409 - I have no idea.    \\
410 - Leonard, there's a crow on your roof.    \\
411 - I see it.    \\
412 - Is that one of Dr. Lee's crows?    \\
413 - (caws)\\
414 - It has a tag on its leg.    \\
415 - (cawing)    \\
416 - Don't make any sudden moves.    \\
417 - Smart. Let's stand perfectly still and...    \\
418 - He's the one you want!    \\
419 - (cawing)
\subsection {Episode 08: The Consummation Deviation}
1 - Hey, you guys have any plans for Valentine's Day?  \\
2 - Three months from now? No.  \\
3 - - What? No?\\
4 - - I mean, secret romantic plans that would be ruined if I told you.  \\
5 - Oh.  \\
6 - What's going on, Raj?  \\
7 - Well, how would you guys feel about going to India for my wedding?  \\
8 - Oh, that's so exciting!   \\
9 - Penny, you will never guess what I have planned for Valentine's Day.\\
10 - - Uh-huh.   \\
11 - Can I feed peanuts to the elephants at your wedding?   \\
12 - - That is such a stereotype!\\
13 - - There won't be any elephants?   \\
14 - Of course there'll be elephants.   \\
15 - It's a stereotype that you feed them peanuts.   \\
16 - Are you really gonna plan a wedding in three months?   \\
17 - Yeah, well, her family's doing most of the work.   \\
18 - They're amazing.\\
19 - We talk all the time.   \\
20 - Why?   \\
21 - Because we're about to get married and they're gonna be my family.   \\
22 - Amy and I are married, and I never talk to her family.   \\
23 - Really? My parents love Leonard.   \\
24 - Yeah. And my mom loves Penny, which is weird, because I never knew she could love.   \\
25 - And my dad has grown to really...like Howard.   \\
26 - Yeah, there's a nice... coolness between us.   \\
27 - Hey, guys, before Anu gets here, can I talk about the seating situation?   \\
28 - I really don't want herto sit on the floor.   \\
29 - Oh. No problem.\\
30 - Bernadette, floor.   \\
31 - - Hey!\\
32 - - Yeah, you can't make my wife sit on the floor.\\
33 - - Fine.   \\
34 - Howard, floor.   \\
35 - Fine, I'll sit on the floor.   \\
36 - Thank you, Penny.\\
37 - And, Leonard, I was kind of hoping I could sit next to Anu.   \\
38 - So now I have to sit on the floor?\\
39 - It's my house.   \\
40 - Why can't Sheldon sit on the floor?   \\
41 - That might be the dumbest thing you've ever said.   \\
42 - WOLOWITZ: Guys, guys, there's a simple solution.   \\
43 - I am not breaking up with her.   \\
44 - All right. Let's keep thinking.   \\
45 - Hey, everybody, it's Anu.   \\
46 - Hi.   \\
47 - ALL: Hi! Welcome!   \\
48 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
49 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
50 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
51 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
52 -  We built the Wall \\
53 -  We built the pyramids    \\
54 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
55 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
56 -  Bang!    \\
57 - (groans):\\
58 - Oh, I am stuffed!   \\
59 - I should not have eaten all those dumplings.   \\
60 - (chuckles)   \\
61 - I think we should have s*x.   \\
62 - (passing horn honks)   \\
63 - (squeakily):\\
64 - Me, too.   \\
65 - Yeah, it's just, we haven't done it yet, and I think it's important to make sure we're compatible before we get married.   \\
66 - I totally agree.   \\
67 - Oh, just one question.   \\
68 - While we're doing it, can I leave my shirt on?   \\
69 - You know, the dumplings, pretty salty.   \\
70 - It doesn't have to be tonight.   \\
71 - How about this weekend?   \\
72 - I can get us a room at my hotel.   \\
73 - Okay. Sounds nice.   \\
74 - We can order a bunch of room service, because I'm not eating anything between now and then.   \\
75 - Aw. Are you worried?   \\
76 - I am not worried.   \\
77 - If anything, I'm overconfident.   \\
78 - Edging into smug.   \\
79 - I'm sure it's gonna be fine.   \\
80 - Oh, it's gonna be better than fine.   \\
81 - Trust me, I've had no complaints.   \\
82 - Good to know.   \\
83 - Well, I've had questions, comments, some constructive criticism,   \\
84 - (snorts):\\
85 - but... no complaints.   \\
86 - You're up early.   \\
87 - Huh? Yes. I wanted to get a jump on planning a day of fun for you.   \\
88 - Oh, that's sweet.\\
89 - What are we doing?   \\
90 - Oh, no. Just you.\\
91 - I have other plans.   \\
92 - Now, would you prefer to see The Grinch in  -D or  -D?   \\
93 - I don't want to see it at all.   \\
94 - Well, let's go  -D. No sense in spending extra money.   \\
95 - What are you gonna be doing?   \\
96 - Being a great husband.   \\
97 - Yeah, you're gonna need to show your work on that.    \\
98 - After last night, I got to thinking that I should have a better relationship with your family.    \\
99 - I think the one you have with them is perfect.    \\
100 - I hardly have one at all.    \\
101 - Which is perfect.    \\
102 - Oh, Amy, they're important to you, and you're important to me.    \\
103 - Therefore, according to the transitive property, they're important to me.\\
104 - It's the same reason I'm interested in your big, flat feet.    \\
105 - Well, you know that my mom can be...    \\
106 - - well, difficult to get along with.\\
107 - - Which is why    \\
108 - I'm starting with your dad and working my way up.    \\
109 - All right.\\
110 - I'm just worried you might have a rather unpleasant day.    \\
111 - Yeah, back at ya.\\
112 - I watched the trailer for The Grinch-- it looks terrible.    \\
113 - (knocking)    \\
114 - - Hi, Sheldon.\\
115 - - Oh, good. You're right on time.    \\
116 - - Hi, Daddy.\\
117 - - Hey, pumpkin.    \\
118 - Pumpkin? I've been calling her spaghetti squash.    \\
119 - It's amazing that one woman can be different vegetables to different men.    \\
120 - Bye.    \\
121 - Bye.    \\
122 - So, how does this work with in-laws?    \\
123 - Am I supposed to be calling you Dad?    \\
124 - Because I don't want to.    \\
125 - - You don't have to.\\
126 - - Oh, thanks, Larry.    \\
127 - Ooh. That doesn't sound right.    \\
128 - (gasps) Maybe I should pick a vegetable for you.    \\
129 - (video game noises on TV)    \\
130 - Hey, Leonard, can you pause the game for a second?    \\
131 - - Uh, hang on.\\
132 - - I'm about to beat Howard.    \\
133 - What? Hey!    \\
134 - What?    \\
135 - He's our friend.    \\
136 - What's up, pal?    \\
137 - I... I don't know how else to say this, but, um, Anu and I are going to have s*x tonight.    \\
138 - Yeah...    \\
139 - Do you know how creepy that sounds?    \\
140 - Yeah...    \\
141 - So, is this the first time?    \\
142 - Yeah.    \\
143 - - How you feeling about it?\\
144 - - Uh... to be honest, I'm pretty anxious.    \\
145 - I mean, this is the woman I'm marrying-- what if it's no good?    \\
146 - Do we break up?\\
147 - Do we...  sign on for a lifetime of mediocre s*x?    \\
148 - Just don't put so much pressure on it.    \\
149 - It's always a little awkward in the beginning.    \\
150 - I remember the first time I slept with Penny.    \\
151 - It was bad?    \\
152 - Oh, it was awesome!    \\
153 - I will replay it in my head until the day I die.    \\
154 - WOLOWITZ: Well, if it helps, I was really nervous my first time with Bernie.    \\
155 - Mostly because I was worried my mom would walk in.    \\
156 - Did she?    \\
157 - Yea-- Yeah.    \\
158 - BERNADETTE: I'll tell you one thing.    \\
159 - Lock the door.    \\
160 - Yeah, Raj, you're gonna be fine.    \\
161 - Just break out some of your Kama Sutra moves.    \\
162 - I don't really know any of that stuff.    \\
163 - I just pretend I do to impress women.    \\
164 - And by the way, Anu is Indian-- she's gonna know there's no sexual position called a "screeching lotus."    \\
165 - Screeching lotus?    \\
166 - Sometimes I get leg cramps.\\
167 - It's my cover story.    \\
168 - Look, she's probably nervous, too.    \\
169 - Yeah, what if you're great and she's bad?    \\
170 - How can she be bad?    \\
171 - Raj, women can be bad at s*x, too.    \\
172 - (laughs): No, that's silly.    \\
173 - Hey, have you checked the dates on these?    \\
174 - They're all expired.    \\
175 - You buy candy in a comic book store, you get what you get.    \\
176 - It's called Lethal Weapon, but isn't that redundant?    \\
177 - Aren't weapons, by their very nature, lethal?    \\
178 - I suppose you're right.    \\
179 - Yeah, and don't even get me started on Unsolved Mysteries. \\
180 - I didn't get you started on Lethal Weapon. \\
181 - All right, this is another one of my favorite places, the comic book store.\\
182 - Feel free to look around.    \\
183 - Vintage comics in back, vintage candy right here.    \\
184 - What are you guys up to?    \\
185 - Oh, father-in-law, son-in-law bonding.\\
186 - It's going great.    \\
187 - Look at what he bought me at the train store.    \\
188 - (blows whistle)    \\
189 - Yeah, it sounded louder in the car.    \\
190 - Cool. Can I see it?    \\
191 - Hmm? Sure.    \\
192 - Oh. Interesting.    \\
193 - I think this is one of those disappearing whistles.    \\
194 - What are you talking about?    \\
195 - (claps hands)    \\
196 - Voilà!    \\
197 - Amazing.    \\
198 - Where did it go?    \\
199 - Look in your pocket.    \\
200 - (gasping):\\
201 - Oh! Oh!    \\
202 - Oh, how did you do that?    \\
203 - Sorry, a magician never shares his secrets.    \\
204 - I'll give you a hundred bucks.    \\
205 - Sold!    \\
206 - Okay.    \\
207 - Hey.    \\
208 - - Where's my wallet?\\
209 - - Voilà!    \\
210 - Hey, Penny.\\
211 - I need your help.    \\
212 - I am freaking out.    \\
213 - Okay, is she there yet?    \\
214 - No, I got here first.\\
215 - You know... get the lay of the land.    \\
216 - Raj, it's gonna be okay.\\
217 - Look, s*x isn't the most important thing in a relationship.    \\
218 - My first time with Leonard was nothing to write home about.    \\
219 - Really?    \\
220 - Yeah, but, you know, over time it got better.    \\
221 - S-So practice makes perfect?    \\
222 - Well, practice makes better.    \\
223 - (phone chimes)    \\
224 - Oh, my God, oh, my God, she just texted. She's on her way up!    \\
225 - Raj, calm down.\\
226 - You got this.    \\
227 - Yes. Thank you, thank you.\\
228 - I got this.    \\
229 - Just remember, the most important thing is to have fun.    \\
230 - Stop putting so much pressure on me!    \\
231 - Hi.    \\
232 - Everything okay?    \\
233 - Why are you acting so weird?    \\
234 - Raj? What's going on?    \\
235 - (champagne cork pops)    \\
236 - Be right out!\\
237 - You look beautiful!    \\
238 - Sorry, I had to use the facilities.    \\
239 - With a bottle of champagne?    \\
240 - Mm, I like to celebrate the little things in life.    \\
241 - You need to go?\\
242 - There's still some left.    \\
243 - Raj, what is going on?    \\
244 - No, no, it's not what's going on, it's what's comin' off.    \\
245 - Stop it.    \\
246 - You're acting weird, and it's freaking me out.    \\
247 - Why? Because I couldn't talk and ran in the bathroom to slug back a bottle of champagne when I pretended to pee?    \\
248 - Okay, I think I'm gonna leave.    \\
249 - No, no, wait, wait, don't-- okay, don't go.    \\
250 - Fine. Then tell me what's going on.    \\
251 - Well, funny story...    \\
252 - The truth.    \\
253 - Oh, God, the truth is so not good for me!    \\
254 - Voilà.    \\
255 - Darn it.    \\
256 - It's okay.    \\
257 - Here, let me show you again.    \\
258 - It's like you're actually magic.    \\
259 - You can do that but you still can't get my bra off.    \\
260 - The rings don't roll their eyes at me.    \\
261 - Excuse me, Turnip, we need to get going.    \\
262 - But-but Howard was gonna show me some close-up magic.    \\
263 - Well, if you want to see real magic, I'll take you to Union Station, home to trains, subways and busses that, every half hour-- voilà-- drive to the airport.    \\
264 - I'd like to stay, if you don't mind.    \\
265 - Oh, not at all.    \\
266 - Howard. A word.    \\
267 - What's up?    \\
268 - - I need you to stop being so delightful.\\
269 - - What?    \\
270 - I'm supposed to be bonding with him.    \\
271 - You have your own father-in-law; leave mine alone.    \\
272 - Tell you what, you take my father-in-law, I'll take yours.    \\
273 - I don't want your father-in-law.    \\
274 - What if I throw in a quarter?    \\
275 - Do it again.\\
276 - Do it again.    \\
277 - Mrs. Fowler.\\
278 - Mrs. Fowler.    \\
279 - Mrs. Fowler.    \\
280 - Sheldon, what's going on?    \\
281 - Where is Larry?    \\
282 - Oh, Turnip's out; I'm bonding with you.    \\
283 - Okay, you wanted the truth, here it is.    \\
284 - You have a drinking problem.    \\
285 - No. I, uh,\\
286 - I have a talking problem, and a drinking solution.    \\
287 - What does that mean?    \\
288 - (sighs)    \\
289 - Oh, Anu, for most of my life,    \\
290 - I got so nervous around women that I couldn't talk to them without alcohol.    \\
291 - So you've been drunk every time we've seen each other?    \\
292 - No. No. It hasn't happened in a long time.    \\
293 - And I really thought I was over it, but I guess... I-I don't know, I guess I-I wanted so much for tonight to go well, that I-I stressed myself out.    \\
294 - It came back.    \\
295 - (sighs)    \\
296 - Why didn't you tell me about this before?    \\
297 - I was embarrassed.    \\
298 - I get that.    \\
299 - If it makes you feel any better, I've got things I'm embarrassed about, too.    \\
300 - Really? Will you tell me one?    \\
301 - Okay. Um...    \\
302 - Ugh. I hate telling people this.    \\
303 - I don't like music.    \\
304 - What kind of music?    \\
305 - Just all of it.    \\
306 - It sort of seems like a waste of time.    \\
307 - Even Beyoncé?    \\
308 - See, this is why I don't tell people.    \\
309 - No. Um, it's fine. It's just, have you heard "Single Ladies"?    \\
310 - Yeah, and I don't get it.    \\
311 - I mean, the lyrics are "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh."    \\
312 - Y-You have to sing it in the voice of a goddess.    \\
313 - Like:  Oh, wa-ah, oh     \\
314 -  Wa-ah, oh     \\
315 -  Oh, oh, oh     \\
316 -  Wa-ah, oh. \\
317 - (laughs)    \\
318 - My point is, we both have our little eccentricities.    \\
319 - Little eccentricities?    \\
320 - One is a deep-seated psychological disturbance, and the other can be solved by half a glass of chardonnay.    \\
321 - So the doctor prescribed Nizoral and it blocked enzyme action, and the fungus cleared right up.    \\
322 - That's a very disturbing picture.    \\
323 - Yes, well, they say a picture's worth a thousand words, but I say nothing beats a picture and a thousand words.    \\
324 - Still, you might want to take it off Facebook.    \\
325 - Oh, no. It's in my nature to share.    \\
326 - So, your turn.    \\
327 - Uh, other than Amy, have you every had anything removed from your body?    \\
328 - I am not going to answer that.    \\
329 - Smart. Save something for our next get-together.    \\
330 - Oh, we should commemorate this one with a selfie.    \\
331 - Oh, look at us, two peas in a pod.    \\
332 - Oh, speaking of vegetables, how about I start calling you Old Lady Green Beans?    \\
333 - Hey, you look deep in thought.    \\
334 - - Ah, I'm just reflecting.\\
335 - - About what?    \\
336 - The first time we slept together.    \\
337 - Oh, honey. Don't beat yourself up; it's great now.    \\
338 - This is not good.    \\
339 - Sheldon is hanging out with my mom.    \\
340 - Yeah. O-One sec.    \\
341 - W-What do you mean, "don't beat myself up"?    \\
342 - AMY: Guys, focus.    \\
343 - My mom thinks that Sheldon is the reason I don't spend a lot of time with her.    \\
344 - Well, why would she think that?    \\
345 - Because I told her.    \\
346 - You need a cup of coffee?\\
347 - Wake up!    \\
348 - So you've been using Sheldon as an excuse to get out of seeing your mother?    \\
349 - (sighs) I know.    \\
350 - I feel terrible.    \\
351 - I love my mom but, you know, sometimes...    \\
352 - Yeah. We-We've met her. Yeah.    \\
353 - And it's easier to say I can't spend time with her because of Sheldon than to admit that I just, I don't want to.    \\
354 - Totally understandable.    \\
355 - I'll ask again, what do you mean, "don't beat myself up"?    \\
356 - And then you ask me questions to try to determine which Nobel Prize-winning physicist I am.    \\
357 - Ready? Go.    \\
358 - Can I give up?    \\
359 - No.    questions left.    \\
360 - (ringtone playing)    \\
361 - Are you gonna get that?    \\
362 - Oh, no. We're in the middle of a game.    \\
363 -    questions left.    \\
364 - Answer the phone, Sheldon.    \\
365 - Hello, Amy.    \\
366 - Hey, how's it going?    \\
367 - Well, Howard lured your dad away with magic, so now I'm bonding with your mom.    \\
368 - I think she likes me.    \\
369 - I'd like you a lot better if you weren't keeping my daughter away from me.    \\
370 - Uh, wh-- Hang on, Amy.    \\
371 - What's the problem, Green Beans?    \\
372 - Amy said she couldn't come to Thanksgiving dinner because you always have to spend it with your mother.    \\
373 - I haven't spent Thanksgiving with my mother in years.    \\
374 - Amy, why would you tell your mother that I spend Thanksgiving with my mother?    \\
375 - Uh, no time to talk about that now.    \\
376 - All your action figures are on fire.    \\
377 - Harrison Ford's in the lobby.\\
378 - Come quick.    \\
379 - And Amy never joins us for Sunday dinners because you refuse to go out on a school night.    \\
380 - Sh-- I can go out on a school night as long as I'm in my PJs by   :  .    \\
381 - Sheldon, don't listen to her.    \\
382 - She doesn't know what she's talking about.    \\
383 - She's crazy!    \\
384 - Hello, Amy.    \\
385 - Hello, Mother.    \\
386 - Great news. We-we can come for Thanksgiving this year.    \\
387 - I can't believe it.    \\
388 - All this time I've been angry at you when I should have been angry at Amy.    \\
389 - Look at that.\\
390 - We're both angry at Amy.    \\
391 - Maybe that's something we could bond over.    \\
392 - Let me ask you this: how do you feel about Howard?    \\
393 - Oh, is he that odd little friend you have with the haircut?    \\
394 - I may have married the wrong Fowler.    \\
395 - Why would Amy feel the need to lie to me?    \\
396 - Well, perhaps because you're her mother and she didn't want to disappoint you.    \\
397 - Really?    \\
398 - Even after she threw you under the bus, you're still gonna defend her.    \\
399 - Oh, yes.    \\
400 - She's my wife and I love her.    \\
401 - And if I can forgive her for putting ketchup on her eggs, I can forgive her for this.    \\
402 - Her father does that, it's disgusting.    \\
403 - Amy's crazy, you are a delight.    \\
404 - Good morning.    \\
405 - Mm. Good morning.    \\
406 - I ordered some coffee for us.    \\
407 - Oh, fantastic.    \\
408 - (sighs)    \\
409 - Last night was... wonderful.    \\
410 - (sighs) But all we did was talk.    \\
411 - Yeah. And it was wonderful.    \\
412 - Am I safe to assume you talking to me now is a good sign for our marriage?    \\
413 - (chuckles) Yeah, and-and for my liver.    \\
414 - Hey, about the other thing.    \\
415 - Um...    \\
416 - Should we just wait for another night?    \\
417 - Or I go take a shower, and you decide how you want to play this.    \\
418 - Take a shower with me, Raj.    \\
419 - Thank you, Amy.    \\
420 - It's so nice of you to have us over for dinner.    \\
421 - (chuckles) Couldn't think of a single reason not to.    \\
422 - Yeah, and boy, did she try.    \\
423 - Thank you, honey.    \\
424 - Oh, you're welcome, dear.    \\
425 - Would anyone like to see the magic trick Howard taught me?    \\
426 - I'd love to see your trick, Daddy.    \\
427 - A perfectly ordinary table knife.    \\
428 - (exhales)    \\
429 - Watch closely.    \\
430 - Voilà.    \\
431 - Oh, my gosh, that was so good.    \\
432 - Well, look, there's fake blood, too.    \\
433 - I'll be right back.    \\
434 - I don't know about you, but I don't really like magic.    \\
435 - You just keep getting better and better.
\subsection {Episode 09: The Citation Negation}
1 - Sheldon, do you want to put the tables after each section or in an appendix at the end?  \\
2 - You know what?\\
3 - We wrote this paper together.  \\
4 - I think we should decide together that they go in an appendix at the end.  \\
5 - How about that?\\
6 - There is an "I" in "team."  \\
7 - - Look at what we made.\\
8 - - I know.  \\
9 - It really is the best of both of us.  \\
10 - It's got my math and your sassy takedown of the fundamental nature of symmetry.   \\
11 - It's got my bottomless intellectual curiosity and your petulant refusal to spell "gray" with an "a" like an American.   \\
12 - You realize we still have a lot of work to do before we can publish.   \\
13 - Perhaps we should divide and conquer.   \\
14 - Now, you track down all the citations and properly note them in our bibliography, and I will roll up my sleeves and decide what font we want to use.   \\
15 - Sheldon, there are hundreds of citations to track down.   \\
16 - And thousands of fonts, but you don't hear me complaining.   \\
17 - I am not gonna spend weeks in a library looking up old papers.   \\
18 - Can't we hire a grad student to do it?   \\
19 - Yeah, a grad student?   \\
20 - I am not trusting our unpublished paper to some millennial.   \\
21 - They'll put unicorn emojis on it and then post it on social media.   \\
22 - Why would they do that?   \\
23 - Economic anxiety, too much avocado toast, who cares?   \\
24 - Look, the point is, we can't afford to have this paper leaked before we're ready to publish.   \\
25 - That's how you kiss the Nobel Prize good-bye instead of hello as I intend to do.   \\
26 - I assume you mean metaphorically.   \\
27 - Absolutely not. If the King of Sweden hands me a medal, I intend to smear it with Purell and then kiss it.   \\
28 - But what if we ask one of our friends to help us out?   \\
29 - How about Leonard?   \\
30 - Gee, I don't know.\\
31 - Can we trust him?   \\
32 - He's your best friend in the whole world.   \\
33 - Yes, but he's always struck me as the guy in the plane crash who doesn't wait until you're all the way dead to eat you.   \\
34 - I think you can trust him.   \\
35 - Oh, Amy, you never lose that childlike innocence.   \\
36 - Leonard, I need to tell you something.   \\
37 - I'm having an affair.   \\
38 - Okay.   \\
39 - You have to swear not to tell anybody.   \\
40 - Okay.   \\
41 - (stammers)   \\
42 - You are the only one who knows.   \\
43 - Uh, well, you and Rita, the cafeteria lady who has been giving me more than Tater Tots.   \\
44 - Hey, Sheldon.   \\
45 - Not a word.   \\
46 - What did he want?   \\
47 - Oh, nothing. He just concocted some stupid test to see if I can keep a secret.   \\
48 - Ooh, what's the secret?   \\
49 - I'm not gonna tell you that.   \\
50 - The test is stupid, but I still want to pass.   \\
51 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
52 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
53 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
54 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
55 -  We built the Wall \\
56 -  We built the pyramids    \\
57 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
58 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
59 -  Bang!    \\
60 - Congratulations, Leonard, you passed my secret loyalty test.   \\
61 - The truth is, I was never having an affair with the cafeteria lady.   \\
62 - There's only one woman who gets to touch my no-no parts, and she's right here.   \\
63 - - Sheldon.\\
64 - - No, no.   \\
65 - Well, I am shocked, Sheldon, because I totally believed that the woman you reported for being stingy with the peas couldn't keep her hands off you.   \\
66 - Well, I am a little hurt that you weren't gonna tell me my husband was having an affair. I thought we were friends.   \\
67 - I didn't really believe him.   \\
68 - Why not? You don't think other women find him attractive?   \\
69 - (laughing):\\
70 - No.   \\
71 - I suppose you're wondering why I put you through all this.   \\
72 - You mean the last two minutes or the last    years?   \\
73 - We need to ask you a big favor.   \\
74 - Well, you've certainly gone about it the right way.   \\
75 - You know we're almost finished with our paper; we just need help tracking down the citations.   \\
76 - That's busywork. Can't you just get a grad student to do it?   \\
77 - No, this paper is incredibly important to us, and we need someone we can trust.   \\
78 - Please, it would mean a lot.    \\
79 - Y-You know what? Sure.    \\
80 - The three of us in the library looking up old papers-- that actually could be kind of fun.    \\
81 - Oh, no, we won't be there.    \\
82 - It just got more fun.    \\
83 - (gunfire sound effects)    \\
84 - Bam, took him out.\\
85 - (chuckles)    \\
86 - Now I'm doing a victory dance to celebrate.    \\
87 - (funky music plays)    \\
88 - Where are you?    \\
89 - About to shoot some dancing jackass.    \\
90 - Hey!    \\
91 - And now I'm doing a victory dance.    \\
92 - What you playing?    \\
93 - Fortnite. \\
94 - A bunch of people parachute onto an island and fight it out to be the last man standing.    \\
95 - Like Hunger Games? \\
96 - More like Bachelor in Paradise, but not as cutthroat.    \\
97 - Sounds fun. Can I play?    \\
98 - I don't know if you'd like it.\\
99 - It's kind of for gamers.    \\
100 - Hey, I'm a gamer.\\
101 - I play Candy Crush, Bejeweled, and Sesame Street Letter School, which I beat our daughter at every single time.    \\
102 - All right, give it a shot.    \\
103 - This one's how you move, this is how you shoot.    \\
104 - "A" jumps, "B" puts you into build mode.    \\
105 - And depending on what you want to build, you can use LB, RB, LT, or RT.    \\
106 - Just put me in, I'll figure it out.    \\
107 - Oh, sounds like me on our honeymoon.    \\
108 - Okay, you're skydiving down.    \\
109 - You're almost to the ground.    \\
110 - Now, when you land, you're gonna want... (gunfire)    \\
111 - Okay, you're dead.    \\
112 - Wait, that's it?\\
113 - That wasn't fun at all.    \\
114 - Oh, now it sounds like you on our honeymoon.    \\
115 - Thanks for helping with this.    \\
116 - What are friends for?    \\
117 - My friend sent me down to this basement to do his grunt work, so I wouldn't know.    \\
118 - Hey, probably shouldn't say anything, but did you hear about Sheldon and the lunch lady?    \\
119 - Yeah, uh, that's not true.    \\
120 - That's just something Sheldon made up to test us.    \\
121 - I wish I'd known that before I called her a floozy in front of the whole lunch line.    \\
122 - This is a list of the papers we need to pull.    \\
123 - Why don't we split up?\\
124 - You take half, I take half.    \\
125 - I don't know, it's pretty creepy down here.    \\
126 - Maybe we should stay together.    \\
127 - Come on, Raj, it's just a library.    \\
128 - You could say that about anything.    \\
129 - It's just a cemetery.\\
130 - It's just a haunted house.    \\
131 - It's just a portal to hell.    \\
132 - F-Fine, how about we split up but we stay in constant communication with each other?    \\
133 - Yeah, thank you.    \\
134 - Leonard?    \\
135 - - Still here.\\
136 - - Okay.    \\
137 - - Leonard?\\
138 - - Still here.    \\
139 - Okay.    \\
140 - Leonard?    \\
141 - Leonard?    \\
142 - (Leonard gasps)    \\
143 - Oh, God!    \\
144 - Too much dust.    \\
145 - (gunfire sound effects)    \\
146 - Hey, ready for lunch?    \\
147 - Hang on.    \\
148 - Really, video games?    \\
149 - Is this some sort of Freaky Friday thing where you're actually Howard?    \\
150 - Please, if I were Howard, I'd be doing this.    \\
151 - You know what? He's not wrong.    \\
152 - All right, great, can we go?    \\
153 - In a minute. I want to show Howard I can play this game.    \\
154 - You know, you make a lot more money than he does.    \\
155 - Can't you just rub his nose in that?    \\
156 - I can, but I want to rub his nose in this.    \\
157 - Ugh, damn it, why can't I hit anybody?    \\
158 - Here, let me try.    \\
159 - Lots of luck-- it's way harder than it looks.    \\
160 - (explosion)\\
161 - Got him.    \\
162 - Okay, this citation is correct. How you doing?    \\
163 - Pretty good. I'm just looking through "The Effect of High Energy Muons on Proton Pion Scattering at the National Accelerator..."\\
164 - (inhales)    \\
165 - "...Laboratory."    \\
166 - Hey, should we take a break?    \\
167 - No, this actually makes it more exciting.    \\
168 - We have to get through all of this before I run out of this.    \\
169 - It's like the movie Speed, but instead of a bus, it's your lungs.    \\
170 - And instead of Sandra Bullock, it has sadness.    \\
171 - Why did you pull this Russian paper?    \\
172 - Oh, it was cited in this paper over here, so I thought we should check it out.    \\
173 - Mm, it's not translated.    \\
174 - Maybe we should talk to Howard; his Russian's pretty good.    \\
175 - We don't need Howard.\\
176 - I've got Google Translate.    \\
177 - Okay, here we go, from Russian to English.    \\
178 - "Examinations of moose chowder in lemon parachutes."    \\
179 - Yeah, okay, now I know why this app is free.    \\
180 - Oh, gosh, my Russian's a little rusty.    \\
181 - If it helps, this word may be "moose."    \\
182 - Okay.    \\
183 - This paper is called "Examinations of a Super-Asymmetric Model of the Universe" by Dr. Vasily Gregora-poli-popivich.    \\
184 - W-Wait, so Amy and Sheldon weren't the first to think of super-asymmetry?    \\
185 - No, doesn't look like it. This is from     .    \\
186 - Okay, well, they might need to rename their theory    \\
187 - "The Cooper-Fowler Gregora-poli-popivich Theory."    \\
188 - Kind of rolls right off your tongue, doesn't it?    \\
189 - Sheldon is not gonna be happy about this.    \\
190 - Well, he's gonna be less happy about this, uh...    \\
191 - "The super-asymmetric model "is inherently flawed and does not bear the weight of further examination." Hmm.    \\
192 - So this disproves their theory?    \\
193 - Sounds like it.    \\
194 - Oh, how are we gonna tell him?    \\
195 - That's easy. Just go up to him and say, "Sheldon, Raj has something to tell you."    \\
196 - Why do I have to tell him?    \\
197 - You did find it.    \\
198 - I fou-- but he's the one who translated it.    \\
199 - Okay, okay, h-how about this?\\
200 - We all tell him.    \\
201 - Or even better: you tell him.    \\
202 - Yeah, that makes the most sense.    \\
203 - You guys are such cowards.    \\
204 - Yes, we are.    \\
205 - Hey, Denise. Is Stuart here?    \\
206 - Oh, no. Doctor's appointment.    \\
207 - Oh, is he okay?    \\
208 - Not since I've known him.    \\
209 - Which brings up an interesting question.    \\
210 - You and Stuart. Why?    \\
211 - I don't know.\\
212 - My parents owned a funeral home.    \\
213 - Read into that what you will.    \\
214 - What can I help you with?    \\
215 - I was hoping Stuart could show me how to play Fortnite. \\
216 - - Mm, I can teach you.\\
217 - - Really, you good?    \\
218 - Look at my skin. I haven't been outside in six years.    \\
219 - So you'll coach me?    \\
220 - Sure. Now let me ask you a question.    \\
221 - Howard. Why?    \\
222 - You got eyes-- what do you think?    \\
223 - (sighs)    \\
224 - (groans)    \\
225 - (mutters)    \\
226 - (groans, mutters)    \\
227 - (groans)    \\
228 - Wow, I really wish I didn't see this.    \\
229 - Oh, hey.    \\
230 - I just need to give Sheldon some bad news, and I really don't want to.    \\
231 - - Oh, my God. Is everything okay?\\
232 - - No, I-I found a paper that proves their theory wrong.    \\
233 - They thought this was gonna be their Nobel Prize.    \\
234 - It's gonna break his heart.    \\
235 - Oh, man. Maybe leave an anonymous note, you know, like in high school, when you want to let your best friend know that her boyfriend's cheating on her.    \\
236 - Why wouldn't you just tell her that?    \\
237 - I don't know.\\
238 - Maybe you had a hickey.    \\
239 - I-Isn't it better to get bad news from a friend?    \\
240 - Trust me, it's not.    \\
241 - I went to prom with a hickey and a black eye.    \\
242 - Come on, knock on the door.\\
243 - You can do this.    \\
244 - All right, a-all right, here I go.    \\
245 - Oh, wait, just let me get inside.    \\
246 - Why?    \\
247 - "Why"? Come on.    \\
248 - (door closes)    \\
249 -  \\
250 - Oh, hey, Leonard.    \\
251 - Is the podcast too loud?    \\
252 - I didn't hear a podcast.    \\
253 - I told you no one could hear it.    \\
254 - Well, I heard Ira Glass, so he's either in your earbuds or clinging to the ceiling like a gecko.    \\
255 - Actually, I-I need to talk to both of you about your paper.    \\
256 - Oh, right, how are the citations coming?    \\
257 - Well, Raj and I were chasing them down like you asked us to, and, um, we came a-across a, a Russian paper that seems to disprove super-asymmetry.    \\
258 - Are you sure?    \\
259 - Yeah, uh, Howard translated it.    \\
260 - I'm so sorry.    \\
261 - Sheldon, are you, are you all right?    \\
262 - Oh, yes, of course.    \\
263 - Thank you for telling us, Leonard.    \\
264 - I'm sure that wasn't easy.    \\
265 - I guess we don't need this anymore.    \\
266 - (sighs)    \\
267 - (screams)    \\
268 - So what are you listening to, This American Life? \\
269 - Okay, so walk up to that chest and push X.    \\
270 - X. Push X.    \\
271 - Which one's X?    \\
272 - The one with the X on it.    \\
273 - Take it easy, I'm new at this.    \\
274 - What, the alphabet?    \\
275 - You don't have to be snarky.    \\
276 - Hey, do you want to play the game, or do you want to crawl back up your mommy's shirt and chow down like a baby?    \\
277 - Damn, what is wrong with you?    \\
278 - I'm sorry, I thought you wanted to beat your husband.    \\
279 - - I do.\\
280 - - Well, then suck it up!    \\
281 - Okay!    \\
282 - (knocking on door)    \\
283 - Hi.    \\
284 - Can I do anything?    \\
285 - No.    \\
286 - I can make you some tea, I-I could sing "Soft Kitty."    \\
287 - I don't understand how you're not more upset by this.    \\
288 - This is your paper, too.    \\
289 - I am upset, Sheldon.    \\
290 - I'm just trying to hold it together for you.    \\
291 - Like when that goose wouldn't leave us alone at brunch.    \\
292 - That thing scared you, too?    \\
293 - Well, of course it did. I was wearing a down jacket.    \\
294 - Well, I don't need you to pretend to be okay for me.    \\
295 - If anything, that makes it worse.    \\
296 - Fine. I'm not okay.    \\
297 - We came up with this idea at our wedding.    \\
298 - We poured months of our lives into it.    \\
299 - I thought we were changing the course of science, and now it's all gone. I'm devastated.    \\
300 - I was wrong, that makes it worse.    \\
301 - Go back to being happy.    \\
302 - (gunfire over computer)    \\
303 - Hey, guys.    \\
304 - - Hey.\\
305 - - Hey.    \\
306 - You, uh, playing that, what's it called again?    \\
307 - Fortnow? \\
308 - - Fortnite.\\
309 - - Right.    \\
310 - I guess I forgot 'cause I only played it that one time and I was so bad at it.    \\
311 - Don't beat yourself up.\\
312 - It's a hard game.    \\
313 - Would you mind if I gave it another shot?    \\
314 - Mm, maybe later, Berna...    \\
315 - Give me.    \\
316 - Where are you, Howard, where are you?    \\
317 - Let me just build a little ramp, get some height.    \\
318 - You want to press B to go into build-- oh, you already did it.    \\
319 - Did I? I'm just hitting buttons.    \\
320 - Wee!    \\
321 - I see your ramp.\\
322 - I'm coming for you.    \\
323 - You can try, but...\\
324 - (explosion sound effect)    \\
325 - Gotcha.\\
326 - (chuckles)    \\
327 - Son of a bitch.    \\
328 - Want to play again?    \\
329 - No!    \\
330 - - Howard.\\
331 - - What?    \\
332 - I make more money than you.    \\
333 - You got yourself a good one there, buddy.    \\
334 - So neither of them showed up for work today?    \\
335 - No, I tried calling and no one picked up.    \\
336 - Look, I'm sure they're fine.    \\
337 - They were probably up all night coming up with a new theory.    \\
338 - I-I also texted to see if he wanted to go to the new Fantastic Beasts movie and he didn't respond.    \\
339 - All right, well, they're already dead. There's nothing we can do.    \\
340 - SHELDON: Come in.    \\
341 - PENNY: Hey...    \\
342 - You guys look all comfy.\\
343 - Did-did you take the day off?    \\
344 - It's Saturday.    \\
345 - No, it's not.    \\
346 - Great, another thing we're wrong about.    \\
347 - How many does that make, Amy?    \\
348 - Two.    \\
349 - Two things.    \\
350 - What happened to us?    \\
351 - I'll tell you what happened.    \\
352 - Professor Gregoropovich.    \\
353 - I-I think it's Gregora-poli-popivich, but...    \\
354 - Three.    \\
355 - Look, you guys, you had a, you had a setback, you know?    \\
356 - This is the time you got to dig in and-and try harder.    \\
357 - It's like halftime and you're down by seven.    \\
358 - What are you doing?    \\
359 - All right, it's-it's like Bat-halftime and you're down by Bat-seven.    \\
360 - Let me try.    \\
361 - You-you guys can't just give up.    \\
362 - Uh, individually, you are the smartest people I know.    \\
363 - Together, you can do anything.    \\
364 - I appreciate what you're trying to do but please stop.    \\
365 - You can't make this better.    \\
366 - - All right, Amy, listen...\\
367 - - I'm with Sheldon.    \\
368 - We worked our butts off on this paper and it was all for nothing.    \\
369 - And if you think some pep talk can fix that, then you don't understand how much this meant to us.    \\
370 - Is there anything we can do?    \\
371 - No.    \\
372 - Yeah-- wait.    \\
373 - Do I smell Siam Palace?    \\
374 - Oh, yeah, it's our dinner.    \\
375 - I mean, it's your dinner.    \\
376 - Any mango sticky rice?    \\
377 - PENNY: No.    \\
378 - And the blows keep coming.    \\
379 - I see you. I see you... and boom.\\
380 - (explosion sound effect)    \\
381 - Gotcha! How's it feel, Penny?    \\
382 - Like I don't care at all.    \\
383 - Wrong, it feels bad because you lost and I won.    \\
384 - Whoo! What a rush!    \\
385 - All right, can we go eat now?    \\
386 - - Hell yeah.\\
387 - - All right.    \\
388 - Hey, how's it going?    \\
389 - Boom!    \\
390 - Okay, I'm-I'm gonna drive.
\subsection {Episode 10: The VCR Illumination}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...  \\
2 - Actually, I-I need to talk to both of you about your paper.  \\
3 - Oh, right, how are the citations coming?  \\
4 - Um...  \\
5 - We came a-across a-a Russian paper that seems to disprove super-asymmetry.  \\
6 - (screams)  \\
7 - Okay, Sheldon and Amy are still pretty upset about their theory being disproved.   \\
8 - So we have made a list of subjects for everyone to avoid.   \\
9 - - Symmetry.\\
10 - - Asymmetry.   \\
11 - Uh, SimCity-- sounds too much like symmetry.   \\
12 - LEONARD: That also applies to The Simpsons, Simba from The Lion King, and cymbals.   \\
13 - Russia or Russian in any context.   \\
14 - The country, the dressing, the roulette.   \\
15 - Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV. \\
16 - Why Rocky IV? \\
17 - Because he fights a Russian.   \\
18 - I'm sorry about her.\\
19 - (chuckles)   \\
20 - We should just try and avoid anything that makes them think of their project or science or Nobel Prizes or successes or failures.   \\
21 - - Hi.\\
22 - ALL: Hi!   \\
23 - Hey, guys.\\
24 - Hey-a!   \\
25 - What are you guys doing?   \\
26 - Nothing.   \\
27 - Nothing?   \\
28 - Like what my career has come to? Thanks a lot.   \\
29 - Nice going.   \\
30 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
31 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
32 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
33 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
34 -  We built the Wall \\
35 -  We built the pyramids    \\
36 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
37 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
38 -  Bang!    \\
39 - (music playing)   \\
40 - What are you doing?   \\
41 - Eating, reading, watching television, listening to the radio.   \\
42 - What does it look like I'm doing?   \\
43 - Is that asparagus? I thought you hate asparagus.   \\
44 - I thought so, too, but I also thought super-asymmetry was a good idea, so what else am I wrong about?   \\
45 - Oh, so now you're reevaluating every opinion you've ever had?   \\
46 - Yes. I am following the example of   th century philosopher René Descartes.   \\
47 - He subjected all his beliefs to radical doubt so that he could build a bedrock belief and build his cognitive life back up on firm principles.   \\
48 - Ugh! Still yucky, still yucky.   \\
49 - (music stops)   \\
50 - Sheldon, I know you're upset about the paper, okay.   \\
51 - I'm upset, too.   \\
52 - I mean, I was so sure we were right.   \\
53 - Every fiber of my being felt like this was it.   \\
54 - This was the one. How can I trust my instincts anymore?   \\
55 - Well, just because our theory was wrong, that doesn't mean you're wrong about everything.   \\
56 - Doesn't it? I've always thought I hated jazz, maybe I was wrong.   \\
57 - Maybe it's great to hear all the notes at once.   \\
58 - (music playing)   \\
59 - I'm trying, I'm really trying!   \\
60 - - What you eating?\\
61 - - Chicken fried steak.   \\
62 - What? You can't have chicken fried steak first thing in the morning.\\
63 - - Hey,   \\
64 - you knew I was a bad boy when you married me.   \\
65 - Come on, you want a piece of this?   \\
66 - You or the steak?   \\
67 - Me.\\
68 - I'm not sharing the steak.   \\
69 - (knocking)   \\
70 - Hey, you guys busy?   \\
71 - No, what's going on?   \\
72 - I'm really worried about Sheldon.   \\
73 - I've never seen him this down.   \\
74 - Have you tried making him a cup of tea?   \\
75 - He's reevaluated tea.   \\
76 - Now he thinks it's nothing but leaf soup.   \\
77 - That's a good point.   \\
78 - - No, it's not.\\
79 - - No, it's not.   \\
80 - He's rethinking everything.   \\
81 - How long is it gonna be before he gets to me?   \\
82 - - Oh.\\
83 - - It's that bad, huh?   \\
84 - I'm afraid so. I just... I don't know what to do.   \\
85 - I have something that might help.   \\
86 - It's-it's a recording of the only person whose opinion Sheldon actually respects.   \\
87 - Hawking?   \\
88 - Feynman?   \\
89 - No, himself.   \\
90 - It's a pep talk he made when he was a kid.    \\
91 - He gave it to me years ago and told me to save it for a real emergency.    \\
92 - What?\\
93 - You didn't break it out when he declared his room a sovereign nation and waged a trade war against us?    \\
94 - His major export is talking.\\
95 - I didn't want that anyway.    \\
96 - Is that a VCR?    \\
97 - Yeah, Amy asked if we had one she could borrow and I just want to make sure it still works.    \\
98 - What's on the tape?    \\
99 - Not sure. I used to record a lot of Jeopardy! for my mom, but if I push play and you see some naked people...    \\
100 - Got it.\\
101 - What is p0rn?    \\
102 - Ooh, we were looking for "vintage '  s erotica," but I'll accept it.    \\
103 - WOLOWITZ: Hello, everybody.    \\
104 - I am The Great Howdini.    \\
105 - (coughing)    \\
106 - Put it back on. You look adorable.    \\
107 - It's just a practice tape from when I was trying to become a member of the Magic Castle.    \\
108 - I didn't know you auditioned there.    \\
109 - Oh, I never went through with it.    \\
110 - I watched the tape and realized I wasn't good enough.    \\
111 - You know that trick where you saw a mannequin in half?    \\
112 - - Don't you mean a lady?\\
113 - - Thank God it was not a lady.    \\
114 - I'd just be getting out of jail.    \\
115 - Come on, you're a good magician.    \\
116 - Really? You always called magic dumb.    \\
117 - You can be good at something dumb.    \\
118 - - You know what, you should audition now.\\
119 - - It's fine.    \\
120 - I don't need to be a member of the most elite magical society on the face of the earth.    \\
121 - Sounds like you still want it.    \\
122 - And I don't want our kids to watch this tape one day and think their dad is a quitter.    \\
123 - Oh, we don't have to show it to them.    \\
124 - Oh, I'm definitely showing it to them.    \\
125 - Hey.    \\
126 - Hello.    \\
127 - "Fine with flags"?    \\
128 - Yes, flags-- up there flapping around on poles.    \\
129 - If you think about it, they're just the strippers of the emblem world.    \\
130 - Well, I got something that I think might cheer you up.    \\
131 - It is the emergency pep talk you made when you were a kid.    \\
132 - Oh, that.    \\
133 - I was saving it for the day they stop making Star Wars movies.    \\
134 - I don't think that's ever gonna happen.    \\
135 - How long has it been since you've seen it?    \\
136 - Not since the day I recorded it.    \\
137 - No, I had just watched Back to the Future II, where Marty McFly gets a glimpse of his future self and that got me thinking, the day may come where I needed my help, like they did with that movie.\\
138 - That was not great.    \\
139 - Okay, all hooked up.    \\
140 - Here we go.    \\
141 - Oh, look how cute you were.    \\
142 - Amy please, of course I was cute. Look how I turned out.    \\
143 - Hello, Sheldon.    \\
144 - Hello, Sheldon.    \\
145 - If you're watching this, I assume something bad has happened.    \\
146 - Something unfortunate and unforeseen.    \\
147 - Something that's making you question everything.    \\
148 - I'm so smart.    \\
149 - Now just to make sure it's really you watching this and not an imposter, what am I thinking of?    \\
150 - On the count of three.    \\
151 - One, two, three.    \\
152 - Robot monkey butler.\\
153 - Robot monkey butler.    \\
154 - Okay, good.    \\
155 - Should I leave you two alone?    \\
156 - No, this is gonna be inspiring.\\
157 - You should watch.    \\
158 - Sheldon, never forget, no matter how bad things seem,    \\
159 - you can Al...    \\
160 - What? What...\\
161 - No. N... (scoffs)    \\
162 - My dad taped over it with one of his stupid high school football games.    \\
163 - Sorry.    \\
164 - You know, it doesn't matter, nothing matters.    \\
165 - Is there anything I can do?    \\
166 - Yes. You can build me a time machine so I can go back and tell my younger self to give up, because nothing's gonna work out the way he wants.    \\
167 - I was thinking a nice cup of leaf soup.    \\
168 - What's all this?    \\
169 - Your magic tricks from the garage.    \\
170 - Your wands, your top hat with the stuffed mouse inside.    \\
171 - I never had a stuffed mouse.    \\
172 - Okay, do not wear this hat.    \\
173 - Why is it all in the living room?    \\
174 - Because I think The Great Howdini deserves to be a member of the Magic Castle.    \\
175 - That's sweet, but I'm not that guy anymore.    \\
176 - I've outgrown it.    \\
177 - Have you?    \\
178 - Look, I know you still want this, and I can help you.    \\
179 - All those pageants I did as a kid--    \\
180 - I could teach you how to present yourself, connect with the judges, sabotage the competition.    \\
181 - Whoa, whoa, no one's sabotaging anybody.    \\
182 - Of course not.    \\
183 - Little girls in ball gowns trip, it happens.    \\
184 - Trust me, I'm gonna be the pageant mom to you that my mom was to me.    \\
185 - I thought you hated your mom for making you do that.    \\
186 - More talk like that and you're not getting any dinner.    \\
187 - Amazing how it all comes back.    \\
188 - (Skype ringing)    \\
189 - Yes?    \\
190 - - Hello, Mother.\\
191 - - Hey, Beverly.    \\
192 - Hello, Leonard.\\
193 - Hello, Penny.    \\
194 - To what do I owe this call?    \\
195 - I need your professional advice.    \\
196 - Well, I'd love to help you out, dear, but I'm very busy at the moment.    \\
197 - Perhaps we can schedule a time next week.    \\
198 - It's about Sheldon.    \\
199 - Oh, well, I-I suppose    \\
200 - I can spare a minute or two.    \\
201 - Wh-Why did you just say you're too busy, but...    \\
202 - Leonard, please, not everything is about you.    \\
203 - Penny, go on.    \\
204 - Well, ever since his paper got disproven, he's been a wreck.    \\
205 - He's been sad and... and angry.    \\
206 - He just seems kind of broken.    \\
207 - Well, it sounds like he may be grieving.    \\
208 - Really?    \\
209 - - Over a theory?\\
210 - - Of course.    \\
211 - You can grieve over any emotional loss.    \\
212 - The more you care about something, the greater the trauma of losing it.    \\
213 - Oh, boy.\\
214 - He cared about this a lot.    \\
215 - Yeah. What can we do to help him?    \\
216 - Well, grieving is a process.    \\
217 - Every culture has its own rituals and traditions to facilitate mourning.    \\
218 - The ancient Egyptians had their mummification, the Tibetans had their sky funerals...    \\
219 - And when I was little and my dog died, my mom sat me down and very gently told me that she wished the truck had hit my dad instead.    \\
220 - I was trying to lighten the mood.    \\
221 - Your dog had just died.    \\
222 - Howard and I have been working really hard on his audition, so it'll be helpful to get another set of eyes on it.    \\
223 - Well, as someone who has watched every episode of America's Got Talent, I'm getting pretty good at telling when some American's got talent.    \\
224 - Seriously, Heidi and I agree, like,   % of the time.    \\
225 - All right.    \\
226 - Don't be afraid to be brutally honest.    \\
227 - Like my mom used to say when I was doing pageants, "Tears only make your eyes sparkle brighter."    \\
228 - That is both sad and true.    \\
229 - Half my Instagram is after a good cry.    \\
230 - Howie, you ready?    \\
231 - WOLOWITZ (flat): Yeah.    \\
232 - I now present The Great Howdini.    \\
233 - (music playing)    \\
234 -  I've got magic to do, just for you     \\
235 -  I've got miracle plays to play     \\
236 -  I've got parts to perform, hearts to warm     \\
237 -  Kings and things to take by storm     \\
238 -  As we go along our     \\
239 -  Way.     \\
240 - Hello. I'm The Great Howdini from Altadena, California.    \\
241 - I have no brothers or sisters and my favorite thing to eat is grilled cheese.    \\
242 - When does the magic start?    \\
243 - It already started.    \\
244 - Hey.    \\
245 - Hi. How are you guys doing?    \\
246 - A little better, if you can believe it.    \\
247 - Sheldon?    \\
248 - (muffled): Go away.    \\
249 - Buddy, come on, let us help you.    \\
250 - The only person who could help me was erased by the Medford High Wolves.    \\
251 - Oh, that's funny. My high school was also the wolves.    \\
252 - No? Not now? Okay.    \\
253 - LEONARD: Look, t-this might seem strange, but, uh, we thought it might help you get some closure if you had a chance to properly say good-bye to your paper.    \\
254 - Yeah, you know, we could say a few words, you could talk about what it meant to you and-and we could bury it somewhere.    \\
255 - You mean have a funeral for our theory?    \\
256 - Yeah.    \\
257 - That's ridiculous.    \\
258 - I thought so, too, but my mom thought it might work.    \\
259 - Beverly thought it would help?\\
260 - We should try it.    \\
261 - Wha-- How come when you thought it was my idea...    \\
262 - SHELDON: (stammers) Leonard, please, this is not about you.    \\
263 - I guess we could bury it in the park.    \\
264 - Yeah, where dogs do their business and other dogs sniff that business?\\
265 - - I don't think so.    \\
266 - What would you like to do, Sheldon?    \\
267 - The only fitting send-off: a Viking funeral.    \\
268 - You mean, like, push it out into a lake and shoot it with a flaming arrow?    \\
269 - This guy gets it.    \\
270 - How about a bathtub and a match?    \\
271 - How about a bathtub and a flaming arrow?    \\
272 - How about a bathtub, a match and an ice-cold Yoo-hoo after?    \\
273 - Sold.    \\
274 - (sighs)    \\
275 - Would you like to say something?    \\
276 - Y-Yes, thank you.    \\
277 - I know this is just a scientific theory, but to me, it was more than that.    \\
278 - It described the universe in a new and beautiful way.    \\
279 - I want that to be the universe we live in, but I guess it's not.    \\
280 - Amy, would you like to shoot the arrow?    \\
281 - It's kind of beautiful, isn't it?    \\
282 - Yeah, it is.    \\
283 - It's getting kind of close to the curtain.    \\
284 - It's in water, it's fine.    \\
285 - - Oh!\\
286 - - Oh!    \\
287 - Oh!    \\
288 - Looks like we both had theories that were wrong.    \\
289 - PENNY: Okay...    \\
290 - Are you getting sick?    \\
291 - No, I have glitter in my nose.    \\
292 - Just your nose?    \\
293 - Consider yourself lucky.    \\
294 - Hey, I'm gonna take tomorrow off    \\
295 - so we can spend the whole day running the act.    \\
296 - You know what, it has been so much fun working on this with you, but...\\
297 - - But what?    \\
298 - It hasn't.    \\
299 - I'm not gonna audition.    \\
300 - Hey, I didn't raise a quitter.    \\
301 - You didn't raise me at all.    \\
302 - Look,    \\
303 - I get that you're scared, but we just have to push past that.    \\
304 - I'm not scared.\\
305 - I don't like the act.    \\
306 - It's over-the-top and weird and has more jazz hands than magic.    \\
307 - Why didn't you say something earlier?    \\
308 - You seemed like you were so happy, and then when I tried to say something, you seemed like you were so mad.    \\
309 - Hey, this isn't about me.    \\
310 - I just wanted you to have your dream, and I wanted to control everything about how you looked and acted so that your victory was mine.    \\
311 - Well, that's honest.    \\
312 - But if I'm gonna go through with this, I have to do it my own way.    \\
313 - I respect that, and I'm glad that I helped lead you to this moment.    \\
314 - Stop trying to make this your victory!    \\
315 - (crowd cheering, whistle blowing over TV)    \\
316 - Why are you watching that?    \\
317 - I'm just looking to see if there's anything left of your speech.    \\
318 - It's not important.\\
319 - I remember everything I said.    \\
320 - And?    \\
321 - It was good, it just would've meant more coming from me.    \\
322 - All right, bring it in.    \\
323 - Is that your dad?    \\
324 - It is.    \\
325 - I've only seen pictures of him.    \\
326 - I know we're down, by a lot.    \\
327 - And if I'm being honest with you, we're probably not gonna win this one.    \\
328 - In fact, we're definitely not gonna win this one.    \\
329 - Do you want me to turn it off?    \\
330 - But we're not gonna quit, either.    \\
331 - And if we do lose, you need to know that doesn't make you losers.    \\
332 - You learn as much about who you are and what you're made of    \\
333 - from failing as you do from success.    \\
334 - Maybe more.    \\
335 - So you can spend the next half feeling sorry for yourselves, or you can get out there and give them hell.    \\
336 - Yeah! Let's give them hell!    \\
337 - Oh-- watch your mouth, your mom might...    \\
338 - I remember that game.    \\
339 - Did they win?    \\
340 - Oh, no.    \\
341 - No, they lost so bad, the other team    \\
342 - let one of their cheerleaders try to kick a field goal.    \\
343 - Well, that was a nice speech.\\
344 - Too bad it didn't work.    \\
345 - Maybe it did.    \\
346 - What do you mean?    \\
347 - I've been acting like the game is over, but it's only halftime.    \\
348 - And there's a lot more physics left to play.    \\
349 - Wow, was that your first ever sports metaphor?    \\
350 - It was.    \\
351 - And I think it was a home run.    \\
352 - That's two.    \\
353 - It's interesting.    \\
354 - I've always thought that my father's journey and my own were so different, but he also faced failure and setbacks.    \\
355 - Maybe our lives mirrored each other more than I thought.    \\
356 - So, from one viewpoint, you and your father's lives are asymmetrical, but from another vantage point, they're symmetrical.    \\
357 - Sheldon, what if symmetry and asymmetry are observer-relative?    \\
358 - That would mean that the Russian paper was right...    \\
359 - But only from one perspective.    \\
360 - If we look at it from a deeper view in more dimensions, our theory still stands.    \\
361 - Not only stands, i-it might be an even bigger idea than the one we were originally proposing.    \\
362 - Go get your laptop.\\
363 - We have a paper to fix.    \\
364 - (chuckles):\\
365 - Okay.    \\
366 - Thanks, Dad.    \\
367 - We're gonna give them hell.    \\
368 - Hi, I'm The Great Howdini, and it's an honor to be auditioning at the Magic Castle.    \\
369 - Could I borrow your watch, sir?    \\
370 - - Sure.\\
371 - - Thank you.    \\
372 - Ooh, Rolex, fancy.\\
373 - I'll get it right back to you.    \\
374 - Observe: one very expensive watch, one wooden mallet.    \\
375 - Do I dare? I do.    \\
376 - Would you be amazed if your watch survived that pounding?    \\
377 - I think you would-- behold.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Paintball Scattering}
1 - Champagne, a champagne,  \\
2 - a champagne with a packet of Splenda in it.  \\
3 - - You know what I call this drink?\\
4 - - A waste of champagne?  \\
5 - No. A Dr. Cooper.  \\
6 - Because...  \\
7 - He's also sweet and bubbly.  \\
8 - All right.  \\
9 - A... a toast to Sheldon and Amy and the publication of your super-asymmetry paper.   \\
10 - We are so proud of you guys.   \\
11 - - Cheers. - Thanks.\\
12 - - Yay. Boom.   \\
13 - Ooh! That is PhD-licious.   \\
14 - So, have you guys gotten any feedback yet?   \\
15 - Well, there are some comments online, but we haven't read them.\\
16 - We decided we don't care what people say about our work.   \\
17 - PENNY: Good for you.   \\
18 - People online can be so mean.   \\
19 - I posted a picture of myself on Instagram, and some jerk said I looked so skinny I might disappear.   \\
20 - And yet, somehow she soldiers on.   \\
21 - Mm.   \\
22 - Although, Amy and I did give the world a gift.   \\
23 - It would be nice to read some of the thank-you notes.   \\
24 - I'm surprised you're interested in some stranger's opinion.   \\
25 - Well, as I always say, a stranger's just a friend who hasn't complimented me yet.   \\
26 - AMY:\\
27 - Okay.   \\
28 - - I'll read them.\\
29 - - If any of them   \\
30 - accuse you of being too pretty, Penny can help you through it.   \\
31 - Okay, here's one from Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.   \\
32 - Wait, no, stop. I don't want to know.\\
33 - What if he's mean?   \\
34 - Well, what if he's complimentary?   \\
35 - I want to know.   \\
36 - Okay. He says...   \\
37 - - I don't want to know.\\
38 - - All right, just... let me see it.   \\
39 - Okay, this is... this is really positive.   \\
40 - Wow, it's,   \\
41 - like, really positive.   \\
42 - He says it might be the discovery of the decade.   \\
43 - He's right.\\
44 - They love it!   \\
45 - This is so exciting.   \\
46 - Oh, this may be the Dr. Cooper talking, but pour me another Dr. Cooper.   \\
47 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
48 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
49 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
50 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
51 -  We built the Wall \\
52 -  We built the pyramids    \\
53 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
54 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
55 -  Bang!    \\
56 - Hey, Penny and I were thinking of getting a big paintball game together.   \\
57 - (groans): Oh, Leonard, why does she want to shoot you?   \\
58 - She doesn't want to shoot me.   \\
59 - - Who doesn't want to shoot you?\\
60 - - Penny.   \\
61 - No, that doesn't sound right.   \\
62 - She just wants to play paintball.   \\
63 - It combines my love of whimsy with her love of making grown men cry.   \\
64 - Sounds fun.\\
65 - Bernadette and I are in.   \\
66 - - You don't need to ask her?\\
67 - - No. I've been pretty annoying lately.   \\
68 - She's gonna want to shoot me.   \\
69 - Dr. Cooper.   \\
70 - Ah, President Siebert.   \\
71 - What are you doing in the regular cafeteria?   \\
72 - You're a superstar.   \\
73 - No offense, worker bees.   \\
74 - SIEBERT: You should join me in my private dining room.   \\
75 - Dr. Fowler is already there.   \\
76 - Can I bring my friends?   \\
77 - No.   \\
78 - - Can I bring my tater tots?\\
79 - - Yes.   \\
80 - All right, let's go.   \\
81 - Welcome to the inner sanctum.   \\
82 - Oh, I do love a good sanctum.   \\
83 - Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.\\
84 - It's got kiwi on it.   \\
85 - Ugh. I don't like kiwi.   \\
86 - Neither do I, but it's so fancy.   \\
87 - Well, this is nice.   \\
88 - Why have we waited so long to do this?   \\
89 - Because you never invited us.   \\
90 - Ha-ha-ha!   \\
91 - Well, the important thing is you're here now, and we're so excited about your work.   \\
92 - This paper's going to do big things for all of us,   \\
93 - so if there's anything that you need...   \\
94 - You know, actually, I could use some barbecue sauce for my tots.   \\
95 - Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.   \\
96 - Can we have some barbecue sauce and ketchup over here?   \\
97 - Both?   \\
98 - So this is how the other half lives.   \\
99 - I just want you to know that you have our full support, and we're organizing a big media push.    \\
100 - Articles.\\
101 - Interviews.    \\
102 - Oh, you want us to do interviews?    \\
103 - Well, we're thinking a divide-and-conquer approach here, where you do the interviews, and Sheldon stays here and holds down the fort.    \\
104 - You know... in case there's an emergency.    \\
105 - What kind of an emergency would there be in physics?    \\
106 - I don't know, maybe there's an object in motion that won't stay in motion.    \\
107 - Or a reaction that's equal but not opposite.    \\
108 - It sounds like you don't want Sheldon to do the interviews.    \\
109 - It's not that we don't want Sheldon to do the interviews, it's just that we really want you to do the interviews.    \\
110 - Without Sheldon.\\
111 - (stammers)    \\
112 - Now, wait, wait, are you trying to exclude me?    \\
113 - Look, Sheldon, you're a brilliant man, but your people skills are...    \\
114 - This is not barbecue sauce!    \\
115 - This is steak sauce!\\
116 - What are you trying to pull?    \\
117 - Like that.    \\
118 - This is ridiculous.    \\
119 - It is my work, too, and I am perfectly capable of keeping it together for an interview.    \\
120 - Okay. Say somebody asks if you feel your work is derivative of the work of Professor Joseph Polchinski.    \\
121 - Seriously, can we get this man some barbecue sauce!?    \\
122 - Would you mind stocking these?    \\
123 - Actually, I'm not on the clock today.    \\
124 - I'm just hanging out with my boyfriend.    \\
125 - Ah, cool. Huh.    \\
126 - That's me, right?    \\
127 - Oh, I forgot to tell you--    \\
128 - I broke up with you, and now I'm dating... that guy.    \\
129 - I know you're joking, but my flight-or-flight response doesn't.    \\
130 - Isn't it fight-or-flight?    \\
131 - Not for me.    \\
132 - So I told my mom she just needed to back off.    \\
133 - This is our wedding, and if anyone's gonna design the floral arrangements, it's going to be my man.    \\
134 - Thank you.    \\
135 - I mean, I-I'm not trying to be a groomzilla, but... this is my specialty.    \\
136 - (phone rings)    \\
137 - Someone texting you?    \\
138 - Uh, no. It's just my, uh, doorbell camera.    \\
139 - Oh. I got one of those for my place, but I never installed it.    \\
140 - Oh, it's easy.\\
141 - I can do it for you.    \\
142 - You're gonna love it.\\
143 - It's how I found out a raccoon was stealing my cheese-of-the-month club.    \\
144 - What did you do?    \\
145 - Nothing. I didn't want to piss it off.    \\
146 - It was, like, huge from eating all the cheese.    \\
147 - Hey. We're doing a big paintball game on Saturday if you two want to join.    \\
148 - Oh, my roommate asked me to help her move out on Saturday.    \\
149 - Ugh. That sucks.    \\
150 - Sucks for her.\\
151 - I'm playing paintball.    \\
152 - I-I didn't know your roommate was moving out.    \\
153 - Yeah. I've been looking for a new one, but... so far no luck.    \\
154 - You hear that?    \\
155 - She needs a roommate.    \\
156 - (mumbling)    \\
157 - (mumbling)    \\
158 - What do you think, Stuart?    \\
159 - (mumbling):\\
160 - Uh, i-i-it, uh...    \\
161 - Flight.    \\
162 - Flight.    \\
163 - - That was hard to watch.\\
164 - - Yeah.    \\
165 - Okay, I need you to be honest with me.    \\
166 - How do I look?    \\
167 - A little shorter, but as we age that happens to all of us.    \\
168 - Come on, help me out here.    \\
169 - I've got a bunch of interviews today.    \\
170 - Well, no one'll notice.\\
171 - They never met you before.    \\
172 - Sheldon, I'm nervous, and I wish you were coming with me.    \\
173 - If it helps, I wrote up some possible questions and answers for you.    \\
174 - "Whom do you love more, "Sheldon the scientist or Sheldon the man?    \\
175 - "Answer: Sheldon the scientist, but by such a slim margin that it's statistically insignificant."    \\
176 - Well, you really managed to capture my voice.    \\
177 - Well, don't worry. I'm sure you're gonna do great.    \\
178 - Thank you.    \\
179 - - Okay, bye.\\
180 - - Wait-wait-wait.    \\
181 - - You forgot the cards.\\
182 - - Love you, too.    \\
183 - Really? She asked you to move in with her?    \\
184 - Yeah, she was hinting around about it, but I think I handled it pretty well.    \\
185 - "Pretty well"?    \\
186 - You ran out of there so fast, if it was a cartoon, there would have been a Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.    \\
187 - Was she mad?    \\
188 - Uh, no. I talked to her after.    \\
189 - She said she's fine.    \\
190 - - Oh, no. - Yikes!\\
191 - - You'll find someone new.    \\
192 - (phone rings)    \\
193 - Everything okay?    \\
194 - Yeah, it's just Anu's doorbell camera.    \\
195 - I helped her install it.    \\
196 - You can't look at it.\\
197 - That's spying.    \\
198 - Who the hell is this guy?    \\
199 - Ooh, let me see.    \\
200 - He's got... bags.    \\
201 - He's probably just delivering food.    \\
202 - Why is she hugging him?    \\
203 - Maybe she doesn't have tip money?    \\
204 - W-Wait, why is she inviting him into the house?    \\
205 - She's a good tipper?    \\
206 - Do you ever feel guilty that we get to eat in the fancy dining room while our friends have to eat in the regular one?    \\
207 - Yes. Wait, did you say "guilty" or "happy"?    \\
208 - "Guilty."    \\
209 - Oh, then no.    \\
210 - In fact, take a picture of me with the garlic knots to send them.    \\
211 - There's my MVP--    \\
212 - Most Valuable Physicist.    \\
213 - (chuckles): Thank you.    \\
214 - And my star of NPR Science Friday and a potpourri of popular podcasts.    \\
215 - I don't know if I'd use the word "star."    \\
216 - I would. I got an early look at the interview you did for Wired, and it is glowing.\\
217 - They loved you.    \\
218 - That's great.\\
219 - Thanks for telling me.    \\
220 - Congratulations, Amy.    \\
221 - - I'm so proud of you.\\
222 - - And that headline--    \\
223 - "The Neurobiologist Who Revolutionized Physics."    \\
224 - I'm sorry.\\
225 - The who who did what to-- huh?    \\
226 - Oh, hey, how did your interview go?    \\
227 - Okay, I guess.    \\
228 - You don't sound very happy.    \\
229 - Oh, why wouldn't she be happy?    \\
230 - She's the neurobiologist who revolutionized physics.    \\
231 - Sorry.    \\
232 - This should be fun. I've never played before.    \\
233 - Oh, fair warning-- it can get pretty ugly out there.    \\
234 - Okay, well, remember, I'm your fiancée.    \\
235 - (laughing):\\
236 - Oh, I remember. Do you?    \\
237 - All right, we need two teams.    \\
238 - Who wants to be the captain?    \\
239 - Oh, me.    \\
240 - Uh, sure.\\
241 - Why not?    \\
242 - All right, why don't you pick first?    \\
243 - Okay, um... Leonard.    \\
244 - Yeah?    \\
245 - No, I'm picking you.    \\
246 - First? For a team?    \\
247 - What is happening?    \\
248 - All right,\\
249 - I take Bernadette.    \\
250 - Really?\\
251 - You're picking her over me?    \\
252 - Yeah, 'cause she's vicious and can hide behind a mushroom.    \\
253 - Um... Sheldon.    \\
254 - PENNY:\\
255 - Raj.    \\
256 - DENISE:\\
257 - Amy.    \\
258 - PENNY:\\
259 - I'll take Anu.    \\
260 - Howard.    \\
261 - All rightie.    \\
262 - Come on, pick me, pick me.    \\
263 - I will take... Stuart!    \\
264 - Yes!    \\
265 - Okay, guys, we need some people to stay here and guard the flag and some people to move out and try to capture theirs.    \\
266 - Okay. Sheldon, do you want to stay here and...?    \\
267 - What? Hold down the fort?\\
268 - 'Cause that's all I'm good for.    \\
269 - Is that what you were going to say?    \\
270 - You know that's not what he meant.    \\
271 - Oh, why don't you go out there?    \\
272 - Maybe you'll be the neurobiologist who revolutionizes paintball.    \\
273 - Stop it.\\
274 - You're being ridiculous.    \\
275 - Am I? Maybe it's just my poor people skills.    \\
276 - Oh, it's definitely your poor people skills.    \\
277 - All right, the choices are-- get shot at or stay here and listen to them fight.    \\
278 - LEONARD and DENISE and WOLOWITZ: Shot at.    \\
279 - (distant shooting)    \\
280 - (grunts, pants)    \\
281 - This is pretty exciting, sneaking around like this.    \\
282 - Oh, so you like sneaking around.\\
283 - Good to know.    \\
284 - What's that supposed to mean?    \\
285 - Nothing. Never mind.    \\
286 - Let me see if the coast is clear.    \\
287 - See anybody?    \\
288 - Yes, I saw a strange man going into your house the other night!    \\
289 - What?    \\
290 - But out there, there's nobody.    \\
291 - (panting)    \\
292 - Ow!    \\
293 - I'm hit.    \\
294 - (paintball shot)\\
295 - Ow!    \\
296 - I said I was hit!    \\
297 - Sorry.    \\
298 - Ow!    \\
299 - Why do you keep shooting me?    \\
300 - Why don't you want to move in with me?    \\
301 - I-I didn't say I didn't want to.    \\
302 - No, you just ran away.    \\
303 - Stuart?    \\
304 - Stuart?!    \\
305 - Did you run away again?    \\
306 - STUART\\
307 - (in distance): No!    \\
308 - Bang, you're out.    \\
309 - What?! I'm not out.    \\
310 - You didn't even shoot me.    \\
311 - I'm not gonna shoot you from right here.    \\
312 - It's too close.\\
313 - It's gonna hurt.    \\
314 - Oh, come on. It's not gonna hurt that bad.    \\
315 - I'm telling you, from this distance it's gonna... Ow!    \\
316 - See? That hurt!    \\
317 - All right. Fine, you can shoot me.    \\
318 - - No, I'm not gonna shoot you.\\
319 - - Ow!    \\
320 - Ow! Ow!    \\
321 - Aah, you were right.\\
322 - We're way too close.    \\
323 - See, I told you it's gonna hurt...    \\
324 - Ow!    \\
325 - I can't believe you're taking this out on me.    \\
326 - I was just trying to get publicity for our paper.    \\
327 - By making it seem like it was your idea?    \\
328 - I didn't write the headline, Sheldon.    \\
329 - Did you even read the article?    \\
330 - Because I talk about you continuously.    \\
331 - I know, and it just made you sound modest and charming.    \\
332 - AMY: Why can't you just be proud of me?    \\
333 - I am proud of you.    \\
334 - Really? Because you sound jealous.    \\
335 - Well, I'm that, too.\\
336 - I've seen Inside Out. \\
337 - I know I can feel two things at once.    \\
338 - - Ow!\\
339 - - Ow!    \\
340 - Well, now I feel three things.    \\
341 - Hey.    \\
342 - Who shot you?    \\
343 - Oh. Uh, oh...    \\
344 - Denise, uh, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise,    \\
345 - Denise, Denise, Denise,    \\
346 - Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise    \\
347 - and me when I was running from Denise.    \\
348 - What is up with you two?    \\
349 - Well, it's kind of hard to explain. Uh, you know when things are going great, but you worry that any minute you might screw everything up?    \\
350 - - No.\\
351 - - Yes.    \\
352 - If you really like her, you can't let fear get in the way.    \\
353 - You have to move forward.    \\
354 - And at a certain point, the fear of losing her goes away?    \\
355 - I will let you know.    \\
356 - - You were spying on me?\\
357 - - That is not the point.    \\
358 - The point is who was that man?    \\
359 - Fine. That was my ex-boyfriend.    \\
360 - Some of his stuff was still at my house, and he stopped by to pick it up.    \\
361 - And did you give it to him?\\
362 - Did you give him his stuff?    \\
363 - If "stuff" means s*x, then no.    \\
364 - If "stuff" means his Waterpik, then yes!    \\
365 - I got the flag!    \\
366 - I'm gonna make a run for it.\\
367 - Cover me!    \\
368 - So you're still talking to your ex-boyfriend?    \\
369 - Yes, and I'm not gonna apologize for that.    \\
370 - And you need to delete that app from your phone.    \\
371 - Because you're hiding something from me?    \\
372 - No, because you should trust me!    \\
373 - How can I trust you?! I barely even know you!    \\
374 - Then what are we doing?    \\
375 - Why are we planning a wedding?    \\
376 - I don't know.    \\
377 - - (paintball hits)\\
378 - - DENISE: Aah,    \\
379 - sad man!    \\
380 - Ow!    \\
381 - Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.    \\
382 - I can't believe you shot me!    \\
383 - I can't believe I did, either.    \\
384 - Right in the chest.    \\
385 - Sorry. That's gonna leave a bruise.    \\
386 - Yeah, a big one.    \\
387 - - Does it hurt?\\
388 - - A little.    \\
389 - Want to kiss it and make it better?    \\
390 - I do.    \\
391 - Where are you going?    \\
392 - Home.    \\
393 - Don't worry. I'll wave to the doorbell when I get there.    \\
394 - Wait, wait, wait.    \\
395 - At least let me drive you.    \\
396 - That's okay. I'll Uber.    \\
397 - We can take you.    \\
398 - - Come on, Sheldon.\\
399 - - Okay.    \\
400 - But I should warn you, we're in a bit of a spat.    \\
401 - At least I think we are. Amy, are we still in a spat?    \\
402 - Are you ready to apologize?    \\
403 - We are.    \\
404 - - Aha!\\
405 - - WOLOWITZ: Hey!    \\
406 - - BERNADETTE: Get out!\\
407 - - Sorry. Sorry.    \\
408 - I didn't see anything.    \\
409 - Actually, could I...?    \\
410 - Ooh, thank you!    \\
411 - Hey.    \\
412 - Wow. That's a lot of bruises.    \\
413 - Yeah, well, you shot me a lot of times.    \\
414 - That's not even counting the bruises on the inside.    \\
415 - 'Cause I hurt your feelings?    \\
416 - Let's hope that's all it is.    \\
417 - Ah, look, I'm sorry that I freaked out.    \\
418 - It's just that things are going so good with us, and I'm afraid that if we go too fast, I am gonna mess it up.    \\
419 - I get that. I don't want to mess things up, either.    \\
420 - (sighs)    \\
421 - Um, I got you something.    \\
422 - It's a key to my place to show you that I'm serious.    \\
423 - - Thank you.\\
424 - - Mm.    \\
425 - Well, isn't this technically a key to Howard and Bernadette's place?    \\
426 - Yes, so don't ever use it or let them know that you have it.    \\
427 - - Come here.\\
428 - - Oh. Uh, no.    \\
429 - I appreciate it, but seriously, this is all bruise.    \\
430 - Kiss?    \\
431 - Gently.    \\
432 - Ow.    \\
433 - I'm about to start recording.\\
434 - Are you guys ready?    \\
435 - Sheldon, are you ready?    \\
436 - - Absolutely.\\
437 - - Great.    \\
438 - So, Dr. Cooper, my first question is for you.    \\
439 - Oh, goody.    \\
440 - Would you say that your paper is an extension of the work of Professor Joseph Polchinski?    \\
441 - I'll be in the car.
\subsection {Episode 12: The Propagation Proposition}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...  \\
2 - So I told my mom she just needed to back off.  \\
3 - This is our wedding, and if anyone's gonna  \\
4 - design the floral arrangements, it's going to be my man.  \\
5 - Thank you.  \\
6 - I mean, I-I'm not trying to be a Groomzilla,  \\
7 - but... this is my specialty.  \\
8 - (phone chimes)  \\
9 - Everything okay?   \\
10 - Yeah, it's just Anu's doorbell camera.   \\
11 - I helped her install it.   \\
12 - You can't look at it.\\
13 - That's spying.   \\
14 - Who the hell is this guy?   \\
15 - Ooh, let me see.   \\
16 - So you're still talking to your ex-boyfriend?   \\
17 - Yes, and I'm not gonna apologize for that.   \\
18 - And you need to delete that app from your phone.   \\
19 - Because you're hiding something from me?   \\
20 - No, because you should trust me!   \\
21 - How can I trust you?!\\
22 - I barely even know you!   \\
23 - Then what are we doing?   \\
24 - I don't know.   \\
25 - - Oh!\\
26 - - DENISE: Aah,   \\
27 - sad man!   \\
28 - This is so great.   \\
29 - Why don't we do it more often?   \\
30 - Because you have two kids,   \\
31 - I have Sheldon,   \\
32 - and Penny's apparently in the gym all the time,   \\
33 - 'cause damn, look at her!   \\
34 - Yeah, so impressive how you manage   \\
35 - to bounce back after having no babies.   \\
36 - Ah, another reason why we don't do this more often.   \\
37 - You've come to a giant metal door.   \\
38 - I check the door for traps.   \\
39 - There are no traps.   \\
40 - I use my wizard eye   \\
41 - to see what's on the other side of the door.   \\
42 - Hey, that's sort of like how you used a doorbell camera   \\
43 - to spy on your fiancée.   \\
44 - No, it's nothing like that.   \\
45 - Your wizard eye reveals a monster.   \\
46 - - Oh. Is it alone and unloved?\\
47 - - I guess.   \\
48 - I open the door and say, "Hey, Raj."   \\
49 - I have a bottle of champagne for you.   \\
50 - Oh, we didn't order this.   \\
51 - It's from the gentleman at the end of the bar.   \\
52 - Oh. Well, if we drink it, does that mean   \\
53 - we're making a promise?   \\
54 - 'Cause I am happily married, although I will watch.   \\
55 - We're not gonna do anything.   \\
56 - Really?\\
57 - So all that work's for Leonard?   \\
58 - Why don't you just call her? I'm sure   \\
59 - you guys can work this out.   \\
60 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
61 - Let's just play.   \\
62 - Okay, the cyclops tells you   \\
63 - that the enchantress you seek is staying   \\
64 - at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords.   \\
65 - Really? An inn?   \\
66 - Anu is a concierge at a hotel.   \\
67 - That's a little insensitive,   \\
68 - don't you think?   \\
69 - I hadn't noticed that before you mentioned it.   \\
70 - Well, now that I've mentioned it, how do you feel?   \\
71 - Bad.   \\
72 - Shame on you.   \\
73 - - Hey, ladies.\\
74 - - Zack!   \\
75 - Hi. You guys know Zack.   \\
76 - - BERNADETTE: Yeah.\\
77 - - Of course.   \\
78 - Did-did you send this over?   \\
79 - I did. I asked for the most expensive one they have.   \\
80 - They said it was $   ,   \\
81 - and I said I want a more expensive one.   \\
82 - And then, they said it was $   .   \\
83 - But it-it was the same...   \\
84 - Don't.   \\
85 - Thank you, but you shouldn't have spent so much.   \\
86 - Nah.   \\
87 - It's cool. I sold my company for a boatload of money.   \\
88 - And then I bought a boat.   \\
89 - Then I got married.   \\
90 - Guess where.   \\
91 - On your boat?   \\
92 - No, but that would've been awesome!   \\
93 - Well, congratulations.   \\
94 - Hey, you and Leonard   \\
95 - should come over and have dinner with us on our boat.   \\
96 - Yeah, that would be so nice.   \\
97 - Leonard was just saying how he was hoping to have dinner   \\
98 - with one of your ex-boyfriends on his expensive boat.   \\
99 - - Well, then this worked out perfect!\\
100 - - Oh, yeah.   \\
101 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
102 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
103 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
104 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
105 -  We built the Wall \\
106 -  We built the pyramids    \\
107 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
108 -  That all started with a big bang     \\
109 -  Bang!     \\
110 - Hey. How was game night?    \\
111 - Oh, off the charts.    \\
112 - Literally.\\
113 - Sheldon rolled a number so high,    \\
114 - it wasn't on any of these charts.    \\
115 - (laughs) That's funny.    \\
116 - Wow. I should not have driven home.    \\
117 - How was ladies' night?    \\
118 - It was fun. Amy got drunk and kept telling us    \\
119 - that Sheldon's chest is smooth like a porpoise.    \\
120 - Well, it does squeak when you touch it.    \\
121 - And we ran into Zack.    \\
122 - Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?    \\
123 - - He got married.\\
124 - - Oh. Well, that's nice.    \\
125 - Yeah, and he sold his company for a fortune and retired.    \\
126 - Huh.    \\
127 - And you ended up with me, so everybody wins.    \\
128 - Wait. You're not jealous of Zack, are you?    \\
129 - What? Oh, absolutely not.    \\
130 - In fact, he should be jealous of me because I have you.    \\
131 - Oh.    \\
132 - And a dungeon with over    rooms left unexplored    \\
133 - because no one thought to search for secret doors    \\
134 - under the wizard's throne.    \\
135 - Oh. You know, I'd like to go exploring.    \\
136 - - Really?\\
137 - - Mm-hmm.    \\
138 - Well, I'll get the dice back out.    \\
139 - (phone chimes)    \\
140 - Go away, Raj!    \\
141 - What are you doing?    \\
142 - I'm winning you back Love Actually style.    \\
143 - I don't know what that means.    \\
144 - Really? You've never seen Love Actually? \\
145 - If you want to watch it right now, I'll just wait.    \\
146 - I have nothing to say to you.    \\
147 - Look, we both made mistakes.    \\
148 - I am so sorry that I spied on you.    \\
149 - I didn't mean to, but I know it was not okay.    \\
150 - Now, do you want to apologize to me?    \\
151 - You also said you don't trust me and that you barely know me.    \\
152 - I really thought this would be more of a back-and-forth thing.    \\
153 - Honestly, Raj, why do you even want to marry me?    \\
154 - You know, family and India and stuff.    \\
155 - Here's what I think.    \\
156 - All of your friends are married,    \\
157 - and you don't want to be left behind.    \\
158 - And honestly, that's not a good enough reason.    \\
159 - Uh, okay, well, how is that different    \\
160 - than what you're doing? Hmm?    \\
161 - Worried that you wasted    \\
162 - so many years dating the wrong people, and now,    \\
163 - you're just looking for a shortcut.    \\
164 - You're right.\\
165 - It's not different.    \\
166 - Okay, so we agree.    \\
167 - - Yeah.\\
168 - - Great.    \\
169 - Wait. What did we just agree on?    \\
170 - That we shouldn't see each other anymore.    \\
171 - You know what?    \\
172 - Why don't you shut the door, and I'll just do the cards?    \\
173 - Uh, do you remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?    \\
174 - Leonard, I remember all of Penny's ex-boyfriends.    \\
175 - If you'd like, I could list them alphabetically.    \\
176 - No, thank you.    \\
177 - Fun fact. You would think    \\
178 - Zack would be the last one on the list,    \\
179 - but she also dated two Zekes.    \\
180 - Well, apparently, Zack sold his company    \\
181 - for a ton of money and retired.    \\
182 - And that bothers you?    \\
183 - I don't know. I mean...    \\
184 - I guess so. Yeah.    \\
185 - It doesn't seem fair.    \\
186 - I work hard.    \\
187 - I'm really smart.    \\
188 - I've made substantial contributions to my field.    \\
189 - But Zack gets to be rich,    \\
190 - while I'm still working for a paycheck?    \\
191 - Well, a lot of people you don't know are rich.    \\
192 - That doesn't seem to bother you. Mark Zuckerberg,    \\
193 - Sultan of Brunei, Gordon Letwin.    \\
194 - Who's that?    \\
195 - He's one of the first    employees of Microsoft.    \\
196 - Yeah, well, I don't    \\
197 - - have to hang out with Gordon Letwin.\\
198 - - Well, that's too bad.    \\
199 - He helped create the HPFS file system.    \\
200 - Oh, the stories he could tell.    \\
201 - Penny told him we'd go have dinner with him and his wife    \\
202 - on their stupid boat.    \\
203 - Well, just tell her you don't want to go.    \\
204 - Well, then, she'll think I'm being jealous and petty.    \\
205 - So you want to seem mature and confident.    \\
206 - I make one mistake, and she says she doesn't want to marry me.    \\
207 - - Like she never screwed up.\\
208 - - Did she?    \\
209 - Well, she agreed to marry me.    \\
210 - Honestly,    \\
211 - I think you dodged a bullet.    \\
212 - I don't think she was right for you.    \\
213 - Howie, shh.    \\
214 - What?    \\
215 - You can't bad-mouth Anu.    \\
216 - They're gonna get back together,    \\
217 - and you're gonna look like a jerk.    \\
218 - I mean, remember    \\
219 - when we broke up, and Penny said all those mean things about you?    \\
220 - What did she say?    \\
221 - I don't want to get into it.    \\
222 - Some of it was hurtful, most of it was true.    \\
223 - So I'm just supposed to lie to my friend?    \\
224 - I don't want you to lie to me.    \\
225 - No one's gonna lie to you.    \\
226 - (whispers):\\
227 - Lie.    \\
228 - She says    \\
229 - the only reason I'm marrying her    \\
230 - is because all my friends are married,    \\
231 - and I don't want to feel left out.    \\
232 - Oh, that's nonsense.    \\
233 - No. She's right.    \\
234 - (quietly):\\
235 - Now what do I say?    \\
236 - So, Marissa, how    \\
237 - did you guys meet?    \\
238 - Oh, it's a pretty funny story.    \\
239 - We met in a bookstore.    \\
240 - That is funny.    \\
241 - Yeah, I was just there using the bathroom,    \\
242 - but this one had a stack of books, like, this tall.    \\
243 - Oh. So, you really like to read?    \\
244 - Oh, no. I work there.    \\
245 - Yeah, she is super smart.    \\
246 - Seriously, you name, like, any book,    \\
247 - she'll tell you if she's heard of it.    \\
248 - Go on, try her.    \\
249 - Oh, uh, well, uh...    \\
250 - Catcher in the Rye. \\
251 - Nope.    \\
252 - ZACK: Look at that, Penny.    \\
253 - I guess we both like nerds.    \\
254 - So, uh, we gonna take this thing out?    \\
255 - Nah. It's a little choppy tonight.    \\
256 - Yeah, that's okay-- this is nice, sitting under the stars.    \\
257 - It's actually kind of peaceful.    \\
258 - Well, it's a beautiful boat.    \\
259 - Thanks, man.    \\
260 - We love it.    \\
261 - Although, he's so tall he bangs his head    \\
262 - almost every time he goes downstairs.    \\
263 - After the first couple, you don't even feel it.    \\
264 - Where are our manners?    \\
265 - Zack, let's get our guests something to drink.    \\
266 - Oh, you got it, babe.    \\
267 - (quietly): I can't believe that guy's rich.    \\
268 - MARISSA: Ooh, watch your head.    \\
269 - ZACK: That was a close one.    \\
270 - Are you jealous?    \\
271 - I know, I know, I shouldn't be.    \\
272 - He's super sweet. I should be happy for them.    \\
273 - Oh, it's driving me crazy, too.    \\
274 - - Really?\\
275 - - Yes. I was trying to pretend    \\
276 - like it wasn't so you wouldn't think I was petty.    \\
277 - Wha-- turns out we're both petty.    \\
278 - I love you so much.    \\
279 - Aw.    \\
280 - Cheers, guys.    \\
281 - - Aw, thanks.\\
282 - - Thank you.    \\
283 - (laughs)    \\
284 - So listen, I got to be honest.    \\
285 - We sort of have another reason for asking you here.    \\
286 - We want to have a baby,    \\
287 - but we can't do it on our own.    \\
288 - It could be because of the game me and my frat brothers used to play    \\
289 - where we kicked each other in the balls over and over.    \\
290 - But the doc says there's no telling.    \\
291 - We just don't know.    \\
292 - Huh.    \\
293 - You went to college.    \\
294 - And Zack's always admired you    \\
295 - because you're the smartest person he knows.    \\
296 - Okay, whoa, whoa.    \\
297 - Whoa, whoa. You know, this has been such a nice evening.    \\
298 - Let's all just stop before anyone says any more things.    \\
299 - Leonard, would you be the father of our baby?    \\
300 - Aw, you said a thing.    \\
301 - Wow, this is really flattering.    \\
302 - And also really weird, right?    \\
303 - ZACK: Oh, just to be clear,    \\
304 - you don't get to... you know.    \\
305 - No, I...    \\
306 - - I got it.\\
307 - - Just because I slept    \\
308 - with your wife doesn't mean you get to sleep with mine.    \\
309 - We... we get it,    \\
310 - but... thank you for saying it out loud.    \\
311 - You're welcome.    \\
312 - I know it's a big ask, but it would mean so much to us.    \\
313 - ZACK: Yeah, and we    \\
314 - really don't want a stranger's, you know...    \\
315 - - I know.\\
316 - - ...sperm.    \\
317 - And Zack's always talked about what a great guy Leonard is.    \\
318 - I...    \\
319 - (chuckles): I really don't know what to say.    \\
320 - Really? You don't know what to say?    \\
321 - You know, I-I think we should talk about this.    \\
322 - Oh, yeah. Definitely, you guys should talk, yeah.    \\
323 - Take your time.    \\
324 - He means privately.    \\
325 - - Right. Sorry.\\
326 - - Sure. Yep.    \\
327 - - Come on, Zack.\\
328 - - Okay. Yeah.    \\
329 - Okay.    \\
330 - You really think those two should be parents?    \\
331 - There's nothing wrong with them.    \\
332 - - (loud thump)\\
333 - - ZACK: Ow!    \\
334 - (computer chiming)    \\
335 - Hello, Daddy.    \\
336 - Did you install a camera to spy on your fiancée?    \\
337 - What?!    \\
338 - No!    \\
339 - That's what her parents told me    \\
340 - when they said they were calling off the wedding.    \\
341 - But I told them you would never do such a thing.    \\
342 - Thank you.    \\
343 - I mean, I did install a camera    \\
344 - and I did spy on her, but I did not install it to spy on her.    \\
345 - Well, that's not going to be our story.    \\
346 - Our story is that she's a liar.    \\
347 - And-and old.    \\
348 - An old, dirty liar.    \\
349 - Oh, no.\\
350 - She's-she's actually great.    \\
351 - I'm the one who screwed up.    \\
352 - Well, don't say that to them. \\
353 - She's bad. You're good.    \\
354 - They have to pay me back for my wedding deposits.    \\
355 - (sighs)\\
356 - This is all my fault.    \\
357 - I should have...\\
358 - I should have just trusted her.    \\
359 - So you're saying you still want to get married?    \\
360 - Fine. Then I'll call her parents    \\
361 - and we'll straighten this whole thing out.    \\
362 - I don't think she wants to marry me.    \\
363 - And honestly...    \\
364 - she deserves someone better.    \\
365 - (sighs) Rajesh, you need to stop being so hard on yourself.    \\
366 - You're a good man.    \\
367 - (chuckles): Wow.    \\
368 - Y-You've never told me that.    \\
369 - You're also a dope.    \\
370 - That you've said.    \\
371 - But your heart's in the right place,    \\
372 - and you deserve happiness.    \\
373 - So you just need to figure out what you want,    \\
374 - and if that means cancelling the wedding, we cancel the wedding.    \\
375 - Thank you.    \\
376 - But figure it out quickly, or I'll be celebrating    \\
377 - my next birthday with a lot more elephants    \\
378 - and marigolds than I expected.    \\
379 - And Leonard just stood there with a big, dumb smile on his face,    \\
380 - like he was watching a puppy and a monkey make friends.    \\
381 - Well, I can see how he'd be flattered to be asked.    \\
382 - It's not flattering.\\
383 - It's creepy.    \\
384 - Well, something can be both flattering and creepy.    \\
385 - You know, just the other night, Sheldon said that my feet    \\
386 - looked like Richard Feynman's hands.    \\
387 - Really? So you'd be okay    \\
388 - if someone wanted to use Sheldon as their sperm donor?    \\
389 - Oh, absolutely not. I am the only handmaid in this tale.    \\
390 - So Leonard's really considering this?    \\
391 - Yes. We got in a huge fight about it.    \\
392 - He said, well, if I don't want to have his baby,    \\
393 - then why shouldn't someone else be able to? Do you believe that?    \\
394 - What?    \\
395 - Well, there is a deep-seated biological drive    \\
396 - to pass on your genes.    \\
397 - It's only natural.    \\
398 - So you're on his side?    \\
399 - Well, viewing Leonard as a mammal,    \\
400 - it's perfectly understandable.    \\
401 - But viewing him as your husband, he stinks.    \\
402 - And we hate him.    \\
403 - (video game weapons firing) Really? Zack wanted you to donate    \\
404 - your genetic material for his baby?    \\
405 - Yeah. So I'd be helping out a couple who really want a baby,    \\
406 - and they were gonna pay us, and Penny freaked out about it.    \\
407 - - That doesn't make any sense.\\
408 - - I know.    \\
409 - They wanted you? \\
410 - (video game tires screeching, car crashing)    \\
411 - Yes, Sheldon, they wanted me.    \\
412 - I'm smart. I'm nice.\\
413 - I'm smart. I'm nice.    \\
414 - And I can eat cheese without clearing out a room.    \\
415 - Are you upset he didn't ask you?    \\
416 - Of course not. I just think it's interesting    \\
417 - that of all the people he knows, he thinks you're the best choice.    \\
418 - Well, he does.    \\
419 - I don't see why Penny is so against this.    \\
420 - Well, perhaps Penny's worried that you haven't considered    \\
421 - the emotional toll of knowing there's a child out there    \\
422 - who is biologically yours but not actually yours.    \\
423 - (video game tires screech)    \\
424 - Wow, that's really insightful.    \\
425 - Yeah, I'm taller than you and I don't have asthma.    \\
426 - Those people are crazy.    \\
427 - (phone chimes)    \\
428 - Come on, I know you're there, and I know you know it's me.    \\
429 - (groans)    \\
430 - - You're just making this harder.\\
431 - - Look...    \\
432 - you were right.    \\
433 - I was doing this for the wrong reasons.    \\
434 - You deserve to marry someone who knows    \\
435 - how amazing you are... and who proposes    \\
436 - because he doesn't want to spend a single day without you.    \\
437 - Not... not because he wants to catch up to his friends.    \\
438 - Thank you.    \\
439 - And I want you to know, I think I could be that man.    \\
440 - Raj, I'm not gonna marry you.    \\
441 - - I'm not asking you to.\\
442 - - Then why are you here?    \\
443 - Because I like you.    \\
444 - Okay? I like you.    \\
445 - I-I like you enough to start this relationship    \\
446 - at the beginning, not in the middle.    \\
447 - So...    \\
448 - will you go out on a date with me?    \\
449 - (sighs)\\
450 - I don't know.    \\
451 - Okay.    \\
452 - But I warn you,    \\
453 - I just got out of a weird relationship,    \\
454 - and I might complain about my ex a lot.    \\
455 - Maybe he's being weird because he doesn't know how to ask for his ring back.    \\
456 - Hey.    \\
457 - Hi.    \\
458 - Where you been?    \\
459 - Just out.    \\
460 - All right, look, um...    \\
461 - I'm sorry that we fought before.    \\
462 - I know this is a really unusual situation,    \\
463 - and if you don't want me to do it, I won't.    \\
464 - Really?    \\
465 - Yeah.    \\
466 - We're a team.\\
467 - We're in this together.    \\
468 - I'll be right back.    \\
469 - What is that?    \\
470 - It's a sample cup.    \\
471 - Really? 'Cause it looks like the top off the NyQuil bottle.    \\
472 - It's the closest thing I could find.    \\
473 - - It's a gesture. Shut up.\\
474 - - All right, sorry.    \\
475 - So... are you saying you're okay with this?    \\
476 - (sighs):\\
477 - I don't know,    \\
478 - but... when I told you I didn't want to have kids,    \\
479 - you didn't have a say in that, so...    \\
480 - maybe I don't need to have a say in this.    \\
481 - Thank you.    \\
482 - They couldn't have picked a better person.    \\
483 - (chuckles)    \\
484 - Are you calling Zack?    \\
485 - No, Sheldon. Would you say that last part one more time?    \\
486 - Oh, my...
\subsection {Episode 13: The Confirmation Polarization}
1 - Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.  \\
2 - And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.  \\
3 - And this is: Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present...  \\
4 - BOTH: Dr. Sheldon Cooper'sFun with Flags. \\
5 - I'd like to start this episode by apologizing on behalf of Dr. Fowler, who made the wild claim last week  \\
6 - that there was no national tricolored flag with a purple stripe, when, in fact, the Estonian governorate inside the Russian Empire   \\
7 - had a purple stripe on their flag from      to     .   \\
8 - See? Right there in the middle.   \\
9 - And I'd like to apologize on behalf of Dr. Cooper for having his zipper down for the entire segment on the flags of East Africa.   \\
10 - Sorry, Tanzania, you deserve better.   \\
11 - All right, on today's episode, we're gonna start with some viewer e-mails.   \\
12 - Oh, take off your glasses so people can't see your password in the reflection.   \\
13 - Oh, s-sure.   \\
14 - Okay, our first e-mail is-- mm-- from...uh, Brad or Brian?   \\
15 - - I don't know, maybe it's Seth.\\
16 - - All right, put them back on.   \\
17 - Oh. Uh... oh, my gosh, it's from Fermilab in Chicago.   \\
18 - Ah. Not surprising, the Windy City.   \\
19 - Great flag town.   \\
20 - No, no, it's about our paper.   \\
21 - A team of physicists confirmed super-asymmetry.   \\
22 - Our paper was right.   \\
23 - We did it.   \\
24 - We did it?   \\
25 - We did it.   \\
26 - We did it.   \\
27 - BOTH: We did it!   \\
28 - - We did it!\\
29 - - We did it!   \\
30 - Aw, remember when they only did it on her birthday?   \\
31 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
32 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
33 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
34 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
35 -  We built the Wall \\
36 -  We built the pyramids    \\
37 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
38 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
39 -  Bang!    \\
40 - So, my incredible wife has some exciting news.   \\
41 - Howie, stop.\\
42 - I don't want to brag.   \\
43 - Oh, okay, sorry.   \\
44 - (clears throat)   \\
45 - Really? No one's gonna ask?   \\
46 - Sorry. What's your news?   \\
47 - The drug I've been working on for the past five years just got approved by the FDA.   \\
48 - - Wow.\\
49 - - Oh, congratulations.   \\
50 - Was that the decongestant you developed?   \\
51 - No, we had to rebrand that as a solvent for mining equipment.   \\
52 - Is it that anti-itch cream you were testing on grad students?   \\
53 - It's not, but that's a really funny story which I'm legally prevented from telling you.   \\
54 - It's her anti-inflammatory drug.   \\
55 - Oh.   \\
56 - Yep, three years of testing and no reported side effects.   \\
57 - Ah, so it works.   \\
58 - Eh.   \\
59 - Well, congratulations.\\
60 - I'm so happy for you.   \\
61 - Yeah, well, I'm happy for you, because I want you to head up my sales team.   \\
62 - Really? Me? Don't you want someone with more experience?   \\
63 - Nope. The job's all yours.   \\
64 - (laughs)\\
65 - Okay, well, thank you.   \\
66 - Why don't we just chat about this at work?   \\
67 - We can chat about it all you want, but you're doing it.   \\
68 - (chuckles)\\
69 - We'll see.   \\
70 - That's a yes.   \\
71 - You guys will never believe what just happened.   \\
72 - Yeah, we heard.   \\
73 - You did it.   \\
74 - We did do it.   \\
75 - And we didn't even know we did it!   \\
76 - Wait, what?   \\
77 - Two physicists in Chicago had to tell us.   \\
78 - Wait, what?   \\
79 - Their experiment on kaon decay supported our predictions on the higher order corrections pertaining to super-asymmetry.   \\
80 - Wait, what?   \\
81 - I am so proud of you.   \\
82 - Well, I know how to do the dishes.   \\
83 - Just, sometimes I'm tired.   \\
84 - No, I-I mean, I'm proud of how well you're doing at work.   \\
85 - Are you even using soap?   \\
86 - - Do you want to do this?\\
87 - - Yeah, I really do.   \\
88 - You know, it was nice of Bernadette to offer, but I'm not sure it's the right move for me.   \\
89 - Well, what are you talking about?   \\
90 - If you were in charge of her project, wouldn't that be a promotion?   \\
91 - Well, yeah, but it's not the most important thing.    \\
92 - Aren't you always saying it's about the work, not more money or a better title?    \\
93 - All the smart things I say, and you remember the dumb one.    \\
94 - Plus, I'd be working for Bernadette.    \\
95 - I don't know if that's a good idea.    \\
96 - Look, I-I know she can be difficult, but she's no match for you.    \\
97 - Whatever she dishes out, you can give it right back double.    \\
98 - What the hell is that supposed to mean?    \\
99 - There you go.    \\
100 - (intercom beeps)    \\
101 - RECEPTIONIST: President Siebert, I have Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler for you.    \\
102 - Great.    \\
103 - You two.    \\
104 - Bring it in.    \\
105 - (stammers) What are we bringing in?    \\
106 - A hug.    \\
107 - Oh. No, I don't want to.    \\
108 - Well, what you don't want, you don't get.    \\
109 - Come on. Sit.    \\
110 - I hope you know, with these new data supporting your theory, we could be looking at a Nobel-winning achievement.    \\
111 - And by "we," you mean "we," not "we."    \\
112 - "We," "we," whatever.    \\
113 - Whee!    \\
114 - Just a heads-up.    \\
115 - Doctors Pemberton and Campbell from Fermilab Confirming my theory,Angeles, eager to meet me.    \\
116 - They are checking all my boxes.    \\
117 - You know, Caltech has    Nobel laureates.    \\
118 - If you win, you and Amy will be    and   .    \\
119 - Ooh! Dibs on   .    \\
120 - What's the difference?    \\
121 - Wha... You are right, there is no difference at all.    \\
122 - Thank you. It is exciting.    \\
123 - Oh, that's very sweet.    \\
124 - I'm gonna remember you said that.    \\
125 - Just like I remember how you tried to take my office when I was on maternity leave.    \\
126 - (laughs)    \\
127 - Of course I'm not angry.    \\
128 - Bye-bye.    \\
129 - How can I be angry at a dead man?    \\
130 - Hey, you got a sec?    \\
131 - Sure. What's up?    \\
132 - Uh, bad news.    \\
133 - I spoke to my supervisor about heading up your sales team, and she said she just can't lose me right now.    \\
134 - Do you want me to call her?\\
135 - I could rip her a new one.    \\
136 - No, no. No ripping.    \\
137 - Um, anyway, I-I don't want to leave her shorthanded, so I'm sorry.    \\
138 - I respect that.    \\
139 - That's what makes you a good employee.    \\
140 - Oh, thank you.    \\
141 - It's just such a bummer.    \\
142 - I know. Just, ugh!    \\
143 - You sure you don't want me to call her?    \\
144 - Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely sure. Don't call her.    \\
145 - But, you know, just, ugh, why?    \\
146 - The last time we were in this room, we were getting married.    \\
147 - I remember.    \\
148 - It's a lot less impressive without Mark Hamill in it.    \\
149 - That's what you said about our honeymoon.    \\
150 - And I stand by it.    \\
151 - Doctors Cooper and Fowler, these are Doctors Pemberton and Campbell, whose experiment confirmed your work.    \\
152 - - Hello. Nice to meet you.\\
153 - - Nice to meet you. Hi.    \\
154 - Okay, I'll leave you all to it.    \\
155 - Remember about the hugging.    \\
156 - It is such a pleasure to meet you.    \\
157 - Oh, it's really nice to meet you, too.    \\
158 - I mean, we thought we'd have to wait decades to get confirmation for our theory.    \\
159 - Yes, thanks to you, I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner with my original teeth.    \\
160 - Well, this certainly is a thrill for us. Lunch with you two, and, uh, tomorrow, we're gonna see a taping of Ellen. \\
161 - She's having John Stamos on.    \\
162 - Uncle Jesse!    \\
163 - Sounds fun.    \\
164 - So, um, listen, we just published a few months ago.    \\
165 - How did you have time to design an experiment?    \\
166 - We didn't. This whole thing is actually a gigantic accident.    \\
167 - CAMPBELL: Yeah, we've been working with kaons, and our data made absolutely no sense.    \\
168 - A few weeks ago, someone told us about your paper, and we realized that our failed experiment confirmed your theory.    \\
169 - And now, instead of losing our jobs, Fermilab flew us to L.A. Economy Plus.    \\
170 - Free headphones.    \\
171 - Looks like my wife left me a month too soon.    \\
172 - (laughs)    \\
173 - (stammers) So you weren't even thinking about super-asymmetry?    \\
174 - Thinking about it?\\
175 - (chuckles)    \\
176 - We don't even understand it.    \\
177 - (both laugh)\\
178 - PEMBERTON: And now look at the four of us, changing the face of physics!    \\
179 - Ooh, I got to do it.    \\
180 - Oh, man, that last episode of Star Trek: Discovery was crazy.    \\
181 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, I-I'm actually one behind.    \\
182 - I haven't started the new season yet.    \\
183 - Ooh, uh, how about this week's Walking Dead? \\
184 - Two behind.    \\
185 - Three behind.    \\
186 - - Black Mirror?\\
187 - - No.    \\
188 - No.    \\
189 - Come on, there must be something we've all seen.    \\
190 - Oh, how about that video of my dog I sent you, where she's growling at a pinecone?    \\
191 - I actually hadn't watched it yet, but thanks for ruining the ending.    \\
192 - Uh, can you believe this?    \\
193 - Doctors Pemberton and Campbell have been doing a press tour trying to take credit for super-asymmetry.    \\
194 - They didn't even know what they were finding.    \\
195 - So what? I mean, no one's gonna give them credit for accidentally discovering something.    \\
196 - WOLOWITZ: Yeah, who remembers the guy who was trying to find India and discovered America instead?    \\
197 - What was his name again?\\
198 - (chuckles)    \\
199 - But this is different.    \\
200 - Sheldon, super-asymmetry is your paper.    \\
201 - Everyone knows you were there first.    \\
202 - Mm, actually, the Nobel Committee has sometimes favored experimentalists like them over theoreticians like you.    \\
203 - No, that's just a scary campfire story like the guy with the hook.    \\
204 - No, i-it's true.    \\
205 - The scientists that proved the big bang, they thought their sensors needed cleaning until someone pointed out that they were picking up cosmic background radiation\\
206 - from the singularity.    \\
207 - They won the Nobel.    \\
208 - Not the scientists that came up with the theory.    \\
209 - So you're saying they could steal our Nobel Prize?    \\
210 - - Yes.\\
211 - - That's terrible.    \\
212 - Good news, though:    \\
213 - Now we have something we can talk about.    \\
214 - Hey, you wanted to see me?    \\
215 - - Yeah, come on in.\\
216 - - Okay.    \\
217 - Close the door.    \\
218 - Okay.    \\
219 - Have a seat.    \\
220 - Do I have to?    \\
221 - You really do.    \\
222 - So, I talked to your supervisor, and she said that she never stopped you from working on my team, because you never asked her.    \\
223 - Really?    \\
224 - Oh, you know, you should know, she's been taking our new antidepressant, and lying is one of the main side effects.    \\
225 - Why don't you want to work with me?    \\
226 - I know I can be tough, but that's just 'cause    \\
227 - I'm surrounded by useless idiots.    \\
228 - No, it's not that.    \\
229 - Then why?    \\
230 - Honestly, I don't know if I'm up to it.    \\
231 - You know, the last project I managed    \\
232 - - was my high school yearbook.\\
233 - - And?    \\
234 - And that was the year we didn't have one.    \\
235 - Apparently, the printers won't make them without getting paid.    \\
236 - What happened to the money?    \\
237 - Uh, if I didn't know then, I'm not gonna magically know now.    \\
238 - Plus, you know, I didn't go to college.    \\
239 - I'd be in charge of people that are far more educated with more experience; what if they don't listen to me?    \\
240 - Then you be really mean to them.    \\
241 - Have I taught you nothing?    \\
242 - Penny, everybody feels like you do.    \\
243 - Like they're not good enough,    \\
244 - - not smart enough.\\
245 - - What, even you?    \\
246 - - Of course.\\
247 - - Dr. Rostenkowski, you wanted me...    \\
248 - Hey, did they not teach knocking at Stanford? Get out!    \\
249 - (chuckles) I love that kid.    \\
250 - There you are.    \\
251 - Dr. Cooper, hello.    \\
252 - Hello to you, too. Now stop trying to steal our Nobel Prize.    \\
253 - You come up with your own idea.    \\
254 - Yeah, that's not gonna happen.    \\
255 - Wouldn't that be something, though?    \\
256 - Well, too bad.    \\
257 - This discovery belongs to Amy and me.    \\
258 - (sighs)    \\
259 - Look, Dr. Cooper, we all want a Nobel Prize.    \\
260 - Super-asymmetry could be the breakthrough that gets us there.    \\
261 - But we can't fight over credit; we have to work together.    \\
262 - So... you're saying that the four of us should just agree to share this discovery?    \\
263 - Well, no, unfortunately, only three people can share a Nobel.    \\
264 - Oh, that's right.    \\
265 - So he's out?    \\
266 - No, I'm not out.    \\
267 - So he's out?    \\
268 - Neither of us is out.    \\
269 - We think that the three physicists should be the ones to win the Nobel Prize for physics.    \\
270 - Wait, so you want to cut Amy out?    \\
271 - No, of course not.    \\
272 - We don't want to, but we're going to.    \\
273 - But she's my wife.    \\
274 - Yes, exactly, she's your wife.    \\
275 - And she's a neuroscientist.    \\
276 - It's like, what's she even doing on this paper?    \\
277 - It just raises questions.    \\
278 - Look, Fermilab is going to recommend the three of us to the Nobel Committee.    \\
279 - The best chance we have is if your university does the same.    \\
280 - I see.    \\
281 - So you really think that I'm the kind of man who would sell out his partner for the chance of winning a Nobel Prize?    \\
282 - Are you?    \\
283 - Boy, I hope not.    \\
284 - I can't believe Penny doesn't want    \\
285 - - to head up my sales team.\\
286 - - That's too bad.    \\
287 - But it's her decision, not yours.    \\
288 - Do you hear how dumb you sound?    \\
289 - Why does this matter to you so much?    \\
290 - Because I believe in her, and I make people better.    \\
291 - It's what I do.    \\
292 - Against their will?    \\
293 - It's no fun if they want to.    \\
294 - That's just called watching.    \\
295 - Look at Howard.    \\
296 - He was a disaster when I met him.    \\
297 - Now he's a foxy astronaut with a hot wife.    \\
298 - Wait, he always wanted to be an astronaut.    \\
299 - He thinks that, too.    \\
300 - That's how good I am.    \\
301 - Wait, so what are you gonna do?    \\
302 - Just badger her until she says yes?    \\
303 - Mm, that may have worked on you, but she's too smart for that.    \\
304 - Well, if you like fixing people, I could use some help.    \\
305 - Raj.    \\
306 - Why do you think you stopped wearing Crocs and socks?    \\
307 - Uh, well, one day I just woke up and realized they looked silly.    \\
308 - Yes, you did.\\
309 - All on your own.    \\
310 - (whispering): That's how good I am.    \\
311 - (clucking tongue)    \\
312 - What's wrong?    \\
313 - Why do you assume something's wrong?    \\
314 - Because you haven't touched your dinner, and you're literally ticking like a bomb about to go off.    \\
315 - Oh, Amy.    \\
316 - You see through me like one of Penny's shirts.    \\
317 - Just tell me.    \\
318 - I talked to Doctors Pemberton and Campbell today.    \\
319 - They reminded me that only three people can share a Nobel Prize.    \\
320 - Their university is recommending the two of them and me.    \\
321 - And they want Caltech to do the same.    \\
322 - Oh.    \\
323 - They say, if we present a united front, we have a much better shot at winning.    \\
324 - Well, you know, that makes sense.    \\
325 - Oh, but don't worry. I won't do that to you.    \\
326 - Maybe you should.    \\
327 - What?    \\
328 - This has been your lifelong dream.    \\
329 - And you may not get another chance.    \\
330 - I don't want to be the reason that you don't win a Nobel.    \\
331 - You're the only reason I deserve one.    \\
332 - But if your best shot is with them,    \\
333 - I think you should take it.    \\
334 - Is this really what you want me to do?    \\
335 - I just want you to be happy.    \\
336 - Thank you.    \\
337 - (clicking tongue)    \\
338 - Hey. How long have you been sitting there?    \\
339 - Long enough for two of your neighbors to ask if I was lost and looking for my mother.    \\
340 - I'm not changing my mind, Bernie.    \\
341 - That's okay. I'm sorry.    \\
342 - It was wrong of me to badger you into doing something that made you uncomfortable.    \\
343 - Thank you.    \\
344 - Mm, it's probably for the best.    \\
345 - I need someone who's strong and confident to head up my sales team, so I'm giving it to Karen.    \\
346 - What... Karen?\\
347 - Well, what's the job?    \\
348 - Eating my yogurt and then lying about it?    \\
349 - I'm just saying.    \\
350 - She went to college.\\
351 - She's really smart.    \\
352 - Well, I'm smarter than Karen.    \\
353 - I can read the word "Penny" on a cup of yogurt.    \\
354 - Why are you getting so upset?    \\
355 - I'm agreeing with you.\\
356 - This is a big job, and I need someone who's up to it.    \\
357 - I am up to it.\\
358 - I'm just nervous about it.    \\
359 - I know.    \\
360 - And that's why I don't want to pressure you into doing something that you clearly don't want to do.    \\
361 - I know what you're up to.    \\
362 - Is it working?    \\
363 - Yes.    \\
364 - - So I'll see you Monday morning?\\
365 - - Yes.    \\
366 - I bet I can make that girl president.    \\
367 - (intercom beeps)    \\
368 - RECEPTIONIST: Uh, President Siebert, Dr. Cooper is...    \\
369 - I need to talk to you about the paper that Dr. Fowler and I published.    \\
370 - Send him in.    \\
371 - Amy and I did this together, and I will not be part of an award that does not recognize the value of her contributions.    \\
372 - So you either include both of us in the recommendation letter, or don't bother writing one.    \\
373 - I hope you know that's going to cause a fight between us and the Fermilab team.    \\
374 - If it's a fight that doesn't involve any touching, risk of physical harm or uncomfortable eye contact    \\
375 - 'cause it's happening online or through intermediaries,    \\
376 - I say bring it.    \\
377 - All right.\\
378 - I respect your decision.    \\
379 - You do?    \\
380 - Yes. You and Dr. Fowler have my full support.    \\
381 - Oh, okay.    \\
382 - I anticipated a little more pushback.    \\
383 - Sorry, my job here is to serve your needs, both academic and personal.    \\
384 - Huh.    \\
385 - Well, now I'm filled with all this nervous energy.    \\
386 - I don't know quite what to do with it.    \\
387 - We have a fully equipped gymnasium.    \\
388 - Yeah... Really?    \\
389 - Where's that?    \\
390 - It's part of the new sports complex.    \\
391 - Oh.    \\
392 - And where is that?    \\
393 - Come on, I'll show you.    \\
394 - Are there monkey bars?    \\
395 - All right, now, I'm sure some of you are wondering, "Who is this woman?    \\
396 - "How did she get to be in charge of the sales team?    \\
397 - Is it because she's friends with Dr. Rostenkowski?"    \\
398 - Because she is.    \\
399 - "Is it because she was Miss Cornhusker and still fits in those very same jeans?"    \\
400 - 'Cause she was, and she does, and they're actually a little baggy.    \\
401 - Or is it because she's the best damn salesperson here?    \\
402 - Because I am.    \\
403 - Now that we're clear on that, here are the drug specs and marketing strategy for Inflamminex.    \\
404 - Which, now that I say it out loud, might be a placeholder.    \\
405 - By tomorrow, I want everyone to have this committed to memory.    \\
406 - Do you have it committed to memory?    \\
407 - You want to have a contest, Karen?    \\
408 - Winner gets a yogurt.    \\
409 - No, boss.    \\
410 - All right, now we all know what we need to do.    \\
411 - Let's go do it.    \\
412 - R-Right now.\\
413 - Get out of here. Go.    \\
414 - That was really impressive.    \\
415 - Damn right it was impressive.    \\
416 - - Okay, that tone doesn't work with me.\\
417 - - Sorry, boss.
\subsection {Episode 14: The Meteorite Manifestation}
1 - Ooh, it's freezing out here.  \\
2 - Would you like me to... heat things up?  \\
3 - No, I want to get in the hot tub before I lose a toe.  \\
4 - Oh. That is bright!  \\
5 - Yeah, a new neighbor put in floodlights.  \\
6 - Huh.  \\
7 - So, shall we?  \\
8 - No. I don't want to take my robe off under a spotlight.   \\
9 - This is a candle body.   \\
10 - MAN (calls): Howdy, neighbors!   \\
11 - We haven't met yet. I'm Andy.   \\
12 - Oh. Hello. Nice to meet you.   \\
13 - You know, your new balcony kind of looks right over our fence.   \\
14 - ANDY: You might want to put up some trees. We can see everything.   \\
15 - You can, but it's okay if you don't.   \\
16 - So, can you turn your lights off?   \\
17 - Sorry, they're motion-sensored.   \\
18 - They'll go off in a minute.\\
19 - Just try to stay still.   \\
20 - (door closes)   \\
21 - What are we gonna do about this?   \\
22 - I say we wait until his lights go off, and then I make hot, motionless love to you.   \\
23 - Don't move.\\
24 - It's go time.   \\
25 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
26 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
27 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
28 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
29 -  We built the Wall \\
30 -  We built the pyramids    \\
31 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
32 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
33 -  Bang!    \\
34 - And his new balcony looks right down on our hot tub, which meant we couldn't do anything.   \\
35 - So you gave your kids Benadryl for nothing?   \\
36 - Why do I share with you?\\
37 - You're such a yenta.   \\
38 - Are we done talking about Howard's failed conjugal relations?   \\
39 - I have an actual Nobel Prize crisis to deal with.   \\
40 - Has anything changed since the last time you talked about it?   \\
41 - No.   \\
42 - Is there anything you can do about it?   \\
43 - No.   \\
44 - Then shut up or go wait in the car!   \\
45 - LEONARD: Excuse me.   \\
46 - Remember you all came here to check out my cool new laser?   \\
47 - Oh, right. I'm gonna go wait in the car.   \\
48 - The best part is that it's europium-based, so...   \\
49 - And then Andy said if we want privacy, we should plant some trees.   \\
50 - The only way I know how to do that is to give a dollar and tree shows up in Israel.   \\
51 - Okay. Anyway, so because it's europium-based...   \\
52 - Hey. I need some help with a meteorite I found.   \\
53 - Ah. I'd be happy to.   \\
54 - Oh, no, I meant Raj.   \\
55 - I really need an astrophysicist.   \\
56 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Wow.   \\
57 - This is exactly like a dream I had.   \\
58 - Except in the dream, you're Gal Gadot.   \\
59 - I don't really have dreams, when I sleep or in life.   \\
60 - Anyway...   \\
61 - I X-rayed this meteorite, and it looks like there's some sort of organic signature inside of it, but I could really use another opinion.   \\
62 - Well, great.\\
63 - Let's go check it out.   \\
64 - LEONARD: Cool.   \\
65 - I'm gonna stay here and show Howard...   \\
66 - I want to see it!   \\
67 - Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by.   \\
68 - (electrical humming)   \\
69 - Screw them. That's cool.   \\
70 - Hey, I'm not sure we're in the right line.   \\
71 - - Is this for the city zoning office?\\
72 - - Yes, it is.   \\
73 - Or, as we call it here, "the zone zone."   \\
74 - (chuckles)   \\
75 - WOMAN (calls): No, we don't.   \\
76 - That's Linda.   \\
77 - Ignore her.\\
78 - She's going through the change.   \\
79 - Now, how can I help you?   \\
80 - Our neighbor built a balcony that looks right into our backyard, and we're trying to see if there's anything we can do about it.   \\
81 - Well, you have come to the right place.   \\
82 - You know, a lot of people handle this type of thing online, but I always say nothing beats the human touch.   \\
83 - (chuckles)\\
84 - Oh, but don't worry.   \\
85 - I'm not gonna actually touch you.   \\
86 - We had quite the informative meeting on that.   \\
87 - We just want a little privacy in our backyard.   \\
88 - You know, for...\\
89 - (clicks tongue)   \\
90 - (quietly): Maybe we should've done this online.   \\
91 - No, no, no, no.\\
92 - The zone zone is a safe zone.   \\
93 - LINDA: Stop saying "zone zone"!   \\
94 - So, is there anything we can do?   \\
95 - Absolutely. Do you know if they have permits for the balcony?    \\
96 - Oh, no. We were hoping you could check.    \\
97 - I certainly can. I just need you to fill out a form, and we have them available in Armenian, Chinese, Cambodian, English, Farsi, Korean, Spanish and Vietnamese.    \\
98 - Well, English, obviously.    \\
99 - Well, we're not allowed to presume.    \\
100 - That was a whole other meeting.    \\
101 - So we just fill out the form and that's it?    \\
102 - Oh, no. No, you need to fill it out, and then you need to bring it down to the Office of Code Compliance.    \\
103 - Now, if your neighbors don't have a permit, you can file an official complaint, but if they do have a permit, then you have to make the case that the balcony constitutes a nuisance, an encumbrance or an encroachment, and you have to decide which, because they are three totally separate forms.    \\
104 - This is starting to seem like more trouble than it's worth.    \\
105 - I know, right? (chuckles)    \\
106 - (sneezes)    \\
107 - - You okay?\\
108 - - Yeah.    \\
109 - Great, 'cause you just bought that whole row of Batmans.    \\
110 - Sorry, I...    \\
111 - (sneezes)    \\
112 - And now you bought Aquaman.\\
113 - Good choice.    \\
114 - If you want cold medicine, Stuart has the entire run of DayQuils, including the rare "DayQuilt" misprint from     .    \\
115 - What can I say?\\
116 - I'm a collector.    \\
117 - Thanks, but I'm fine.\\
118 - I think it's just allergies.    \\
119 - - Hi, guys. - Hey.\\
120 - LEONARD: Hey.    \\
121 - Oh, heads up.    \\
122 - If that Aquaman feels wet, it's not a gimmick.    \\
123 - Leonard sneezed on it.    \\
124 - - You sick?\\
125 - - Uh, it's just allergies.    \\
126 - Oh. So, check it out.    \\
127 - This meteorite that Bert found is really cool.    \\
128 - We did a spectrographic analysis, and there's... there's definitely something going on inside.    \\
129 - Well, y, i-if you want, we could use my new laser to cut it open.    \\
130 - Well, thanks, but Bert's got this water-cooled, diamond-bladed saw.    \\
131 - Well, sure, but with my laser, you'd get a thinner slice, which would make for a better sample.    \\
132 - STUART: Whoa, whoa.    \\
133 - You're not gonna cut open a meteor, are you?    \\
134 - Have you not learned anything from comic books?    \\
135 - Space viruses?\\
136 - Pod people?    \\
137 - I sell nothing but warnings.    \\
138 - C-Calm down, Stuart.    \\
139 - You're being a little crazy.    \\
140 - Oh, is he?\\
141 - Is he being crazy?    \\
142 - Or is he the only one around here who's making any sense?    \\
143 - It's nice they found each other.    \\
144 - Yeah. Uh, so, anyway, you want to use my laser?    \\
145 - Eh, sorry.\\
146 - It's kind of Bert's thing, and he wants to do it his way, so...    \\
147 - Okay.    \\
148 - Yeah, that's cool.    \\
149 - Just seems dumb to not use the laser.    \\
150 - Not as dumb as unleashing a plague on mankind, but, hey, what do we know?    \\
151 - Literally nothing.    \\
152 - We spent half the day down at the city planning office, and didn't solve a thing.    \\
153 - Now we have to go back tomorrow.    \\
154 - The planning office?\\
155 - You lucky ducks.    \\
156 - Yeah, this one made me go for ice cream and talk about her day.    \\
157 - Spoiler alert: it was fine.    \\
158 - It wasn't fine. I got trapped in an elevator.    \\
159 - I may have missed a few details.    \\
160 - The bottom of my cone was drippy.    \\
161 - So now we have to download all these forms and fill them out.    \\
162 - SHELDON: We get it.    \\
163 - Your life is great.\\
164 - Stop rubbing it in.    \\
165 - Yeah, quit it.    \\
166 - SHELDON: Is one of the forms the    B/C?    \\
167 - Because, if so, it has a doozy of a typo.    \\
168 - I don't know.    \\
169 - All right, well, I don't want to spoil anything, but you might want to start practicing your "siglature."    \\
170 - Sheldon, if you like this stuff, why don't you come and do it with us?\\
171 - - Or instead of us?    \\
172 - (gasps)\\
173 - Do you mean it?    \\
174 - No, no, wait, it's too late.\\
175 - You can't take it back. Yes.    \\
176 - Well, Amy, looks like the elevator might have been the high point of your day.    \\
177 - Hey, where's Raj?    \\
178 - Uh, he's working with Bert.    \\
179 - They're probably cutting their stupid meteorite open with their stupid diamond saw.    \\
180 - (blows nose)    \\
181 - - Are you okay?\\
182 - - Yeah.    \\
183 - I'm just a little run-down.    \\
184 - It might be a head cold.    \\
185 - Purell.    \\
186 - Purell.    \\
187 - Purell.    \\
188 - Purell.    \\
189 - Can I top anybody off?    \\
190 - It's just so frustrating.    \\
191 - I-I know my laser would be way more efficient.    \\
192 - They're gonna lose so much meteorite due to kerf loss.    \\
193 - Mm. I'm sorry your friends won't let you play kerf with them.    \\
194 - Don't make it sound childish.    \\
195 - It's the scientific word for dust.    \\
196 - What was wrong with "dust"?    \\
197 - Are you sure you're not just a little jealous?    \\
198 - No. It's just, my way is better, but they won't even consider it.    \\
199 - Oh, well, it's their loss. Look, why don't you go to bed.    \\
200 - I'll run out and get you some medicine.    \\
201 - Ah, it's okay.    \\
202 - Stuart gave me some when I was at the comic book store.    \\
203 - Really? You're taking medicine from Stuart?    \\
204 - Doesn't he need, like, all of it?    \\
205 - Mm, he's got plenty.    \\
206 - His pill caddy is, like, this big.    \\
207 - All right, well, why don't you go to bed.    \\
208 - I'll sleep out here on the couch.    \\
209 - No, no, no, you take the bed. I'll stay out here.    \\
210 - Even better. Sweet dreams, snot bag.    \\
211 - See what I'm talking about?    \\
212 - Oh, yes.    \\
213 - Oh, that is textbook encroachment.    \\
214 - And I know because I have the textbook.    \\
215 - First edition.    \\
216 - Watch what happens when you move.    \\
217 - Oh!    \\
218 - Oh, boy, you weren't kidding.    \\
219 - Oh, those are   ,    lumens if they're a lumen.    \\
220 - Well, you know what they say: when life give you lumens, make lumen-Ade. (chuckles)    \\
221 - Was that a joke?    \\
222 - Yes.    \\
223 - Based on the premise that "lumen" sounds like "lemon"?    \\
224 - Yes.    \\
225 - (chuckles): That's hilarious.    \\
226 - Okay, what is the setback on property lines in this neighborhood?    \\
227 - Oh, I don't know.    \\
228 - It must be on the permit from when you built your deck.    \\
229 - Uh, yeah, my dad built this.    \\
230 - We didn't do the whole permit thing.    \\
231 - Here we go.    \\
232 - Are you saying I'm standing on an unpermitted deck?    \\
233 - It's been here for years, Sheldon. It's fine.    \\
234 - How did the inspector not flag this when he came to check out your bathroom renovation?    \\
235 - Uh...    \\
236 - (grunts)    \\
237 - Are you telling me that I have showered in an uninspected bathroom?    \\
238 - You showered in our house?    \\
239 - You made me hold your children.\\
240 - What did you expect me to do?    \\
241 - (exhales)    \\
242 - You think you know people.    \\
243 - You do know them, Sheldon.    \\
244 - Yeah, but-but do we?\\
245 - Do we really know them?    \\
246 - Yes!    \\
247 - They're rule breakers, Amy.    \\
248 - And you know what we do with rule breakers?    \\
249 - Complain about them to our spouse until she's ready to drive into oncoming traffic?    \\
250 - You can't cross a double yellow line.    \\
251 - What is this, the Purge?    \\
252 - So, I guess you're not gonna help them?    \\
253 - Oh, I'm gonna help them-- help them get on the right side of Johnny Law.    \\
254 - Oh, you can't turn them in.    \\
255 - The city's gonna make them rip out all the work they've done and do it over.    \\
256 - It would be the end of your friendship.    \\
257 - What choice do I have?\\
258 - These are the rules.    \\
259 - Sheldon, I am begging you.\\
260 - Please, don't do this.    \\
261 - You know who doesn't get permits for their decks? Animals.    \\
262 - Animals don't have decks.    \\
263 - Oh, really? I have one word for you: beavers.    \\
264 - (blows nose)    \\
265 - (sniffles)\\
266 - Bert?    \\
267 - Raj?\\
268 - (sniffles)    \\
269 - Huh.    \\
270 - Can't believe they're gonna cut that with this punk-ass diamond saw.    \\
271 - Geez.    \\
272 - Oh, hey, look.    \\
273 - "Siglature."    \\
274 - - Next!\\
275 - - Hello.    \\
276 - Hi! Welcome to the zone zone.\\
277 - (chuckles)    \\
278 - (chuckles):\\
279 - Oh, that's funny!    \\
280 - Hey, I also have a joke for you.    \\
281 - Lumen-Ade.    \\
282 - Maybe I told it wrong.    \\
283 - Well, how can I help you?    \\
284 - If I know someone in violation of the building code, should I turn them in?    \\
285 - Interesting question.    \\
286 - Yeah, I know. Because, on the one hand, Confucius says we owe a greater responsibility to people we're close with rather than to society at large.    \\
287 - But, on the other hand, Socrates says that we're obligated to obey all laws, even unjust ones.    \\
288 - And then, furthermore, if we're entertaining rules about when it's okay to break the rules,    \\
289 - I should-- where does it end?    \\
290 - Well, for me, it ends at  :  .    \\
291 - Well, I just-- I don't know what to do.    \\
292 - All I can tell you is that the building codes are there for everyone's safety.    \\
293 - Oh, so you're saying I have no choice but to turn them in.    \\
294 - I did not say that.    \\
295 - But would you?    \\
296 - And remember that I laughed at your "zone zone" joke.    \\
297 - LINDA: It's not even a joke!    \\
298 - Oh, is that Linda back there?    \\
299 - - Yeah.\\
300 - - Aw.    \\
301 - How are her hot flashes? Any better?    \\
302 - (mouths)    \\
303 - Leonard, what are you doing?!    \\
304 - Showing you that this is the better way.    \\
305 - Stop! Whatever's inside there is dangerous!    \\
306 - (zapping)    \\
307 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh.    \\
308 - And pretty.    \\
309 - What is that?    \\
310 - (gas hisses, Leonard shouts)    \\
311 - Are you okay?\\
312 - (groans)    \\
313 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
314 - I'm just feeling a little...    \\
315 - (distorted):...hungry.    \\
316 - (screaming)    \\
317 - Stop eating Bert!    \\
318 - Keep eating Bert!    \\
319 - (screaming)    \\
320 - PENNY: Leonard. \\
321 - Leonard!\\
322 - What? What?    \\
323 - You're having a bad dream.    \\
324 - Oh, thank God.    \\
325 - I was eating my friends.    \\
326 - Well, one friend and one acquaintance.    \\
327 - You know what, Bert's okay. Two friends.    \\
328 - Let me see if you're running a fever.    \\
329 - Yeah.    \\
330 - Oh, yeah, you're burning up.    \\
331 - (screaming)    \\
332 - (screams)    \\
333 - Geez!    \\
334 - Are you okay?    \\
335 - (pants)\\
336 - That depends.    \\
337 - What-what color are my eyes?    \\
338 - I don't know, brown?    \\
339 - No, green. No, wait, brown.    \\
340 - Oh, good, I'm awake.    \\
341 - Howie, someone's here to see you.    \\
342 - Hello.    \\
343 - Hey. What's going on?    \\
344 - Can you come over here?    \\
345 - Sheldon, the deck is safe.\\
346 - You can walk on it.    \\
347 - (sighs)    \\
348 - (exhales)    \\
349 - Oh, that gets the heart going.\\
350 - Mm.    \\
351 - So, what's up?    \\
352 - I went down to the city Code Compliance Office to turn you in.    \\
353 - Are you kidding?    \\
354 - But I didn't do it.    \\
355 - I filled out the form and then realized that the unwritten rules of friendship are more important than the written rules of the city of Altadena's Zoning and Planning Department.    \\
356 - Aw.    \\
357 - Really? "Aw"?    \\
358 - And you'll be happy to know that, while I was there,    \\
359 - I did look into your neighbor's balcony, and it is encroaching on your property line.    \\
360 - I had all this pent-up snitch energy, so I reported him hard.    \\
361 - What did they say?    \\
362 - He's going to have to remove it.    \\
363 - (chuckles)\\
364 - So the good guys win?    \\
365 - Well, I don't know if I'd call you the good guys.    \\
366 - You're enforcing a law on him that you're willfully ignoring yourselves.    \\
367 - Uh, all right, fine.    \\
368 - So the morally compromised guys win.    \\
369 - Apparently so.    \\
370 - Now, if one of you'd be kind enough to take me home, I need to use my bathroom.    \\
371 - What's wrong with the one here?    \\
372 - I'm sorry, I want to live.    \\
373 - (sniffles)    \\
374 - Hey. You guys got a second?    \\
375 - Leonard, I told you, buddy. We don't need to use your laser.    \\
376 - Yeah, all we need is Terry Brad-saw.    \\
377 - That's what I named my saw.    \\
378 - No, I-I just wanted to apologize for yesterday.    \\
379 - I just-- I think I was jealous, you know?    \\
380 - Sheldon and Amy might win a Nobel Prize, and now you guys have this cool meteorite project.    \\
381 - - Really? You're jealous of us?\\
382 - - Yeah.    \\
383 - I even had this crazy dream last night where I ate you both.    \\
384 - - Seriously?\\
385 - -Uh...    \\
386 - I know. I was pretty out of it.    \\
387 - Who'd you eat first?    \\
388 - Oh. Uh, you.    \\
389 - (chuckles) Nice.    \\
390 - (jackhammer rattling)    \\
391 - This is just delightful.    \\
392 - Do you think he knows we're the ones that got him in trouble?    \\
393 - - Who cares?\\
394 - -I do. I met his wife.    \\
395 - She seems really nice.    \\
396 - ANDY: Sorry about the noise, neighbor!    \\
397 - No problem!    \\
398 - Hey, you guys know a Sheldon Cooper?!    \\
399 - No, we do not!    \\
400 - Is it just me or has no one been in the store for hours?    \\
401 - Yeah, it is weirdly quiet.    \\
402 - (gasps)\\
403 - Nobody's in the street.    \\
404 - Huh. Well, that's strange.    \\
405 - You thinking what I'm thinking?    \\
406 - They cut that meteorite open and unleashed a space plague?    \\
407 - Exactly.    \\
408 - Let me just lock up here.\\
409 - (lock clicks)    \\
410 - Okay. So what do we do?    \\
411 - Uh, well, if this is a worst-case scenario and we're the last two people alive, we're gonna, we're gonna have to rebuild civilization.    \\
412 - Do you have any special skills?    \\
413 - I can draw.    \\
414 - How 'bout you?    \\
415 - I can play clarinet.    \\
416 - Oh, I didn't know that.    \\
417 - - Yeah, ten years.\\
418 - - Ah.    \\
419 - You know, it, uh, might also be up to us to repopulate the Earth.    \\
420 - I'm okay with that.\\
421 - (chuckles)    \\
422 - So... shall we?    \\
423 - Wait here. I'm gonna brush my teeth.    \\
424 - Sorry, we're closed!    \\
425 - This is going on Yelp!
\subsection {Episode 15: The Donation Oscillation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - Uh, we sort of have another reason for asking you here.\\
3 - We want to have a baby,   but we can't do it on our own.\\
4 - Okay, whoa, whoa.\\
5 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
6 - Yeah, this has been such a nice evening.\\
7 - Let's all just stop before anyone says any more things.\\
8 - Leonard, would you be the father of our baby?\\
9 - Oh, you said a thing.\\
10 - Thank you, guys, again for agreeing to do this.\\
11 - Yeah, it means so much to us.\\
12 - Ah, we're happy we can help.\\
13 - Yeah, and we don't find it weird at all.\\
14 - It's a little weird for us, too.\\
15 - I mean, instead of our baby looking like Zack, it's gonna look like Leonard.\\
16 - Or Penny if it's a girl.\\
17 - No, no, it's not gonna look...\\
18 - Sure.\\
19 - But I promise, we're gonna be really good parents.\\
20 - Mm-hmm.\\
21 - Oh, we know you will.\\
22 - - So, what is the next step?\\
23 - - Yeah.\\
24 - Well, Leonard, we were hoping you'd go in on Monday.\\
25 - Okay.\\
26 - And they say, for the best results, between now and then, you shouldn't have s*x.\\
27 - ZACK: Sorry, bro, I know it seems impossible to go for five days without, but I believe in you.\\
28 - Five days?\\
29 - My record is    years.\\
30 - Uh, I think that also means no flying solo.\\
31 - Oh.\\
32 - Then my record is    years.\\
33 - And, well, we're really hoping for a son.\\
34 - So just, like, keep that in mind when you're in there.\\
35 - Yeah, just think, "Little boys, little boys." Still just totally not weird.\\
36 - Hello.\\
37 - Oh, hey, Sheldon.\\
38 - We're kind of in the middle of something.\\
39 - Oh, I won't be a moment.\\
40 - I just need to grab a book off a high shelf, which I can do because I am both tall and smart.\\
41 - Sheldon, come home!\\
42 - They don't want to have your baby!\\
43 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
44 - Oh-oh, dear, I think I got something in my eye.\\
45 - My piercing, blue eye.\\
46 - - Sheldon!\\
47 - - Fine.\\
48 - I've also never had a cavity and I don't have asthma...\\
49 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
50 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!   \\
51 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
52 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools   \\
53 -  We built the Wall  \\
54 - We built the pyramids   \\
55 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
56 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
57 -  Bang!   \\
58 - (sighs)\\
59 - So, this week would have been my wedding if Anu and I hadn't decided to slow things down.\\
60 - Oh, yeah, I would have forgotten, except for those nonrefundable airline tickets to India I bought.\\
61 - I'm sorry.\\
62 - No, no.\\
63 - What's $ ,   between friends?\\
64 - Yeah, I probably would've just thrown it away on health care for my children.\\
65 - Uh, if you still want to go, you can go to India and help my dad eat all the nonrefundable sushi.\\
66 - Indian sushi?\\
67 - I need a change of underwear just thinking about that.\\
68 - I really think we made the right decision.\\
69 - Agreed, although I did have a pretty awesome bachelor party planned for this weekend.\\
70 - Really?\\
71 - What was it?\\
72 - Well, I used my NASA connections to get us four seats on that plane that lets you experience weightlessness.\\
73 - The Vomit Comet.\\
74 - That is so cool.\\
75 - I've always wanted to experience weightlessness.\\
76 - The closest I ever came was that time I accidentally set my scale to kilograms.\\
77 - I know, it would've been fun, but, hey, the next time you decide to marry a woman you barely know.\\
78 - We could still go.\\
79 - You know, make it a guys' weekend.\\
80 - Yeah.\\
81 - (chuckles)\\
82 - All right, let's do it.\\
83 - Great.\\
84 - It'll be like the good old days.\\
85 - You mean when we were all sad, desperate and horribly alone?\\
86 - I remember it more fondly.\\
87 - Leonard, if you had food on your face, would you want me to tell you?\\
88 - Where?\\
89 - Did I get it?\\
90 - Oh, no, not now; it was last week.\\
91 - I didn't know whether or not to tell you, but everyone was staring.\\
92 - For the record, it was right there.\\
93 - And it was Nutella.\\
94 - Thanks.\\
95 - You looked like a hazelnut Hitler.\\
96 - Hey, who wants to hear some exciting news?\\
97 - Oh, what's up?\\
98 - This weekend, I got us four seats on the Vomit Comet.\\
99 - Oh, you lost me at "vomit," you lost me again at "comet,"  and to be honest, I was on the fence at "us."  \\
100 - Yeah, I can't go either.\\
101 - Penny's dad is visiting from Nebraska, and I haven't seen him for a while.\\
102 - Oh, that's nice you guys get along.\\
103 - I forget, Howard, does your father-in-law still hate you?\\
104 - WOLOWITZ: He doesn't hate me.\\
105 - He's just disappointed that I'm not any other man on the planet.\\
106 - That's how I feel about Ben Affleck as Batman.\\
107 - Well, these two are out.\\
108 - There goes our guys' weekend.\\
109 - Okay, so let's make it a couples' weekend.\\
110 - I'll bring Anu, you bring Bernadette.\\
111 - I'm not sure Bernie would like it.\\
112 - Maybe I'll invite Stuart or Bert.\\
113 - SHELDON: Oh, go with Bert!\\
114 - He's huge.\\
115 - It'd be fun to watch him float around.\\
116 - Like that time the Underdog balloon got away at the Macy's Parade.\\
117 - Hey.\\
118 - What are those?\\
119 - Oh, vitamins.\\
120 - Zack wants me to take them to increase my virility.\\
121 - Zack used the word "virility"?\\
122 - He may have said "wiener power."   \\
123 - (knock on door)\\
124 - Okay, that's my dad.\\
125 - Now, remember, do not bring up any baby stuff, all right?\\
126 - Not me not wanting one, not you having one with Zack.\\
127 - Got it.\\
128 - And if he brings it up, change the subject to literally anything else.\\
129 - - I got it.\\
130 - But not the Cornhuskers.\\
131 - Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.\\
132 - Is that a sports team?\\
133 - Never mind, you're good.\\
134 - - Daddy!\\
135 - Hi.\\
136 - - Hey, Slugger.\\
137 - (chuckles)\\
138 - Aw.\\
139 - - Hey, Wyatt.\\
140 - - Leonard.\\
141 - Hey, that's a hell of a handshake.\\
142 - Ah, well, you know, I've been taking vitamins.\\
143 - Dad, uh, come on in, sit down.\\
144 - Can I get you something to drink?\\
145 - Maybe a beer?\\
146 - Sure, if you're having one.\\
147 - Okay.\\
148 - And why wouldn't you, since you're not pregnant?\\
149 - Um...\\
150 - Leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend Zack.\\
151 - How 'bout those Cornhuskers?\\
152 - Hey, would you mind if Raj and I went away this weekend?\\
153 - Well, it is important for you two to keep the spark alive.\\
154 - No, just the bachelor party I had planned.\\
155 - I thought we'd do it anyway.\\
156 - Oh, so a guys' weekend?\\
157 - Kinda.\\
158 - I mean, Sheldon and Leonard couldn't make it, so Raj invited Anu and I asked Stuart.\\
159 - Wait, you invited Stuart before me?\\
160 - Actually, I invited Bert before Stuart, but I don't know why I just told you that.\\
161 - Why didn't you invite me?\\
162 - Because (chuckles)\\
163 - I know you.\\
164 - You don't want to float weightless in an airplane.\\
165 - What are you talking about?\\
166 - I love doing crazy stuff like that.\\
167 - Bernie, you got sick from the teacup ride at Disneyland.\\
168 - Lots of people do.\\
169 - We were still in line.\\
170 - So you don't want me to go?\\
171 - No, I want you to go if you're gonna have fun.\\
172 - I don't want you to go if you're gonna be miserable and ruin it for everyone.\\
173 - Which is a long way of saying I want you to go!\\
174 - (quietly): I think this is going pretty good, huh?\\
175 - Maybe for you.\\
176 - You threw me under the bus.\\
177 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
178 - I panicked.\\
179 - He was judging me.\\
180 - Well, yeah, now he's judging me.\\
181 - I know.\\
182 - It worked.\\
183 - You two might want to talk louder or quieter.\\
184 - In high school, he could hear me open a can of beer in my closet under a blanket.\\
185 - So let me get this straight, Leonard.\\
186 - She doesn't want to have your baby, but her dumbbell ex-boyfriend does.\\
187 - Well, I-- no, I wouldn't say it like that.\\
188 - How would you say it?\\
189 - (sighs)\\
190 - Uh, same words, just less angry.\\
191 - Well, I don't know about Los Angeles, but in Nebraska, that's kind of strange.\\
192 - It's strange here, too, and we have a bakery for dogs.\\
193 - And you're okay with this?\\
194 - - I support my husband.\\
195 - - Thank you.\\
196 - But, you know, if you think differently, you should feel free to say so.\\
197 - You know, just like, "Ah!" Make a scene.\\
198 - Okay, look, they can't have kids of their own, and they like that I'm smart, and they want that for their child.\\
199 - No, I get it.\\
200 - You do?\\
201 - Sure.\\
202 - Back on the farm, we had a prize stallion.\\
203 - We didn't let that just go to waste; we put him out to stud.\\
204 - No, no, this is...\\
205 - this is a little different than that...\\
206 - No, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
207 - Uh, you were comparing me to a prize stud.\\
208 - Go on.\\
209 - You have fun with your new best buddy?\\
210 - Hey, it's your fault your dad likes me.\\
211 - You dated idiots your whole life.\\
212 - Well, he was right about one thing.\\
213 - I am married to a stud.\\
214 - (chuckles)\\
215 - Mm.\\
216 - Really?\\
217 - Yeah, I felt so bad about selling you out, I thought I would maybe make it up to you.\\
218 - (both chuckle)\\
219 - (moans)\\
220 - (stammers)\\
221 - Wait, wait.\\
222 - I can't.\\
223 - I mean, I want to, but I'm not supposed to for the next three days.\\
224 - Oh.\\
225 - That's right.\\
226 - I forgot.\\
227 - (groans)\\
228 - All right, well, guess I'll just read a little and then-- I don't know-- go to sleep.\\
229 - Really?\\
230 - That's what you're sleeping in?\\
231 - Oh, you want me to take it off?\\
232 - No.\\
233 - All right.\\
234 - Well, then pipe down and let me read my comic book.\\
235 - Penny, I-I know what you're doing.\\
236 - Just please stop.\\
237 - Ooh, listen to this.\\
238 - "Bam.\\
239 - "Pow.\\
240 - Take that, Batman."  \\
241 - Thanks again for doing this, guys.\\
242 - - Of course.\\
243 - - So excited.\\
244 - I'm glad you came.\\
245 - Howard made it sound like this wasn't your kind of thing.\\
246 - He did say that, but here I am.\\
247 - So what does he know?\\
248 - I'm sorry.\\
249 - I just...\\
250 - (scoffs)\\
251 - didn't think you'd enjoy plummeting to the Earth at     miles an hour.\\
252 - I love going fast, unlike Grandma here, poking along at    miles an hour.\\
253 - Am I right?\\
254 - I've always wanted to do this.\\
255 - I'm an adrenaline junkie.\\
256 - Roller coasters, snowboarding, dating men who bathe with their dogs.\\
257 - It was during a drought.\\
258 - I'm a thrill-seeker, too.\\
259 - I've had to pull back since I became a mom, but I'll still jump on the back of a grocery cart and just roll through the meat section.\\
260 - And I'm married to her, which is quite the ride.\\
261 - (exhales)\\
262 - (sputters)\\
263 - (clinking)\\
264 - Amy?\\
265 - There's something out here.\\
266 - Just trap it under a cup, and I'll be there in a minute.\\
267 - I'll try, but it's Leonard.\\
268 - What?\\
269 - (grunts)\\
270 - Well, what is he doing here?\\
271 - I told you, if we left pizza on the counter, we'd attract something.\\
272 - Oh, hey, guys.\\
273 - Sorry.\\
274 - I used my key.\\
275 - I just needed a place to crash.\\
276 - Is everything okay?\\
277 - Yeah, I...\\
278 - had to get out of the apartment.\\
279 - My wife kept trying to have s*x with me.\\
280 - Been there.\\
281 - Why are you trying to avoid having s*x?\\
282 - Well, we just did it three weeks ago.\\
283 - I was talking to Leonard!\\
284 - Well, I-I have to go to the clinic for Zack and Marissa on Monday, and I'm supposed to save myself until then.\\
285 - Sounds like maybe Penny's not totally on board with that plan.\\
286 - Well, she said she was.\\
287 - But she also said I looked dope.\\
288 - Honestly, I don't even think I looked fly.\\
289 - So you're willing to go through with this, even though she clearly has reservations?\\
290 - If she has a problem, she should say something.\\
291 - She tried to seduce you.\\
292 - If that's not a cry for help, I don't know what is.\\
293 - Penny doesn't want to have kids.\\
294 - I respect that.\\
295 - But this is my chance to leave a part of me behind.\\
296 - Okay, but this isn't gonna make you a dad.\\
297 - It's gonna be their baby, not yours.\\
298 - Although, someday, if that kid wants to know why he's short, nearsighted, and asthmatic...\\
299 - ...he may hunt you down.\\
300 - Are you guys ready for the most intense experience of your life?\\
301 - - Yes.\\
302 - - Definitely.\\
303 - Not to brag, but I'm an astronaut, so I've been weightless before.\\
304 - Can be pretty scary.\\
305 - Please, I'm, like,   pounds.\\
306 - I'm weightless every time I hold more than three balloons.\\
307 - Okay, I just need you guys to sign these waivers, and then you can go get changed.\\
308 - There are a lot of pages here.\\
309 - Is this a waiver or a screenplay you've been working on?\\
310 - I'm sure it's just boilerplate.\\
311 - Absolutely.\\
312 - It's to protect us in case of injury.\\
313 - It says, "Or death."     Which is awesome.\\
314 - - Done.\\
315 - - Where are the changing rooms?\\
316 - Dressing rooms are in the back.\\
317 - No peeking.\\
318 - Here you go.\\
319 - Okay.\\
320 - Should we go get changed?\\
321 - Yeah.\\
322 - Hang on a second.\\
323 - What?\\
324 - Just-- I have two babies at home.\\
325 - What am I doing?\\
326 - If you don't want to do this, then why'd you come?\\
327 - To prove to Howard that he doesn't know me as well as he thinks he does.\\
328 - Looks like he does.\\
329 - Unless I do it and then he doesn't.\\
330 - Why not just be honest?\\
331 - (sighs)\\
332 - You're right.\\
333 - I should be honest.\\
334 - You owe me $ ,    for those plane tickets to India!\\
335 - (cheering on TV)\\
336 - (sighs)\\
337 - Hey.\\
338 - That was a long run.\\
339 - Yeah.\\
340 - Well, I was in the zone.\\
341 - You know, and then in a diner and then in a massage chair at the mall where I fell asleep.\\
342 - Are you avoiding me?\\
343 - Well, I took a nap next to Hot Dog on a Stick.\\
344 - What do you think?\\
345 - I think you're mad at me and Leonard, but maybe...\\
346 - you're really mad at yourself.\\
347 - Why would I be mad at myself?\\
348 - 'Cause you regret this "no baby" plan of yours.\\
349 - You know, it's pretty crappy of you to make me feel bad about this.\\
350 - I'm not trying to make you feel bad.\\
351 - But... do you?\\
352 - Yes.\\
353 - I feel like I'm letting everybody down.\\
354 - Hate disappointing Leonard, but I really hate disappointing you.\\
355 - Oh, Slugger, you could never disappoint me.\\
356 - Okay, your high school years were a little rough.\\
357 - And I'm sorry about that.\\
358 - There was you sneaking out at night and your boyfriends sneaking out in the morning.\\
359 - I said sorry.\\
360 - That time you got drunk and stole a horse.\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - I was there.\\
363 - I remember.\\
364 - Parts of it.\\
365 - But besides all that, being your dad is the best thing ever happened to me.\\
366 - What about Randall and Lisa?\\
367 - They're okay.\\
368 - I just don't want you to miss out.\\
369 - I know.\\
370 - But if this is really what you want--   or don't want--   I'm on your side.\\
371 - Thanks.\\
372 - (door opens)\\
373 - Hey.\\
374 - Hey.\\
375 - Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.\\
376 - Sure.\\
377 - What's up?\\
378 - I want you to back off.\\
379 - You know?\\
380 - I-If Penny and I don't have kids, that's between us.\\
381 - So you need to stay out of it.\\
382 - Oh, Leonard, it's okay.\\
383 - We talked.\\
384 - We're good.\\
385 - Oh.\\
386 - Okay, you could've stopped me sooner.\\
387 - Could've let you go longer.\\
388 - Uh-huh.\\
389 - You did great, Leonard.\\
390 - Very forceful.\\
391 - Yeah?\\
392 - (chuckles)\\
393 - I-I-I felt like my voice was a little shaky there.\\
394 - Um...\\
395 - Hey, I decided to not go through with this Zack and Marissa thing.\\
396 - Really?\\
397 - - But you were so excited about it.\\
398 - - I know.\\
399 - But, um...\\
400 - I think I was just fooling myself.\\
401 - I-I would be heartbroken if I had a kid out there and I wasn't his dad.\\
402 - I know you would.\\
403 - (clicks tongue)\\
404 - Yeah.\\
405 - (inhales deeply)\\
406 - (quietly): So, that thing you wanted to do last night, I'm available.\\
407 - I got real good hearing there, stud.\\
408 - All right, everyone's suited up.\\
409 - Let's head out to the tarmac!\\
410 - Actually, one second.\\
411 - Howie, I don't think I should do this.\\
412 - Really?\\
413 - Well, I did not see that coming.\\
414 - Just-- We have kids, and it's not smart to put us both in danger.\\
415 - That's a good point.\\
416 - When I was little, my parents never flew together.\\
417 - We thought it was because they loved us, but it turns out they hated each other.\\
418 - See?\\
419 - I just think I shouldn't go.\\
420 - Actually, this is much safer than driving a car.\\
421 - Stay out of it, flyboy!\\
422 - You're right.\\
423 - (chuckles)\\
424 - But I've done this before.\\
425 - And since you really, really want to go, I'll stay here.\\
426 - Oh.\\
427 - Great.\\
428 - Unless you don't want to because I was right and I do know you.\\
429 - Well, if you really know me, then you know how far I'll go     to prove a point.\\
430 - - Apparently,   ,  feet that way, then straight back down, up and down, over and over again until you throw up food you didn't even eat.\\
431 - They are definitely your weirdest friends.\\
432 - If only that were true.\\
433 - (screaming)\\
434 - I hate this so much!\\
435 - Why am I doing this?!\\
436 - To prove a stupid point to your husband!\\
437 - Oh, right.\\
438 - Worth it.\\
439 - Hey, Zack.\\
440 - Um, look, I-I know this is gonna be disappointing, but, um, I-I can't do this.\\
441 - No, no, no, no.\\
442 - I-I, I know how. I just can't.\\
443 - (stammers)\\
444 - But, hey, look, i-if you like, I-I know someone who might be interested.\\
445 - No!\\
446 - Absolutely not!\\
447 - I'm sorry, my wife says I'm not allowed.
\subsection {Episode 16: The D & D Vortex}
1 - All right, Professor Proton fans, get ready to meet Dr. Sheldon Cooper   and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, a pair of real-life scientists who may win the Nobel Prize.\\
2 - That's like the Kids' Choice Award, but with more science and less slime.\\
3 - Hi, thanks for having us.\\
4 - Kids' Choice Award?\\
5 - Why would they let kids choose anything?\\
6 - They're basically human larvae.\\
7 - Well, they are kind of our target audience.\\
8 - Greetings, children.\\
9 - Toys, am I right?\\
10 - He is.\\
11 - He has hundreds of them.\\
12 - So you two have discovered something that a lot of people are really excited about.\\
13 - (chuckles)\\
14 - We have.\\
15 - Now, before you explain it, keep in mind that our average viewer is this many.\\
16 - Okay, imagine you're looking in a mirror.\\
17 - The image you see looks just like you.\\
18 - That's called symmetrical.\\
19 - Now imagine you have a billion mirrors, and each of them reflects one thing about you correctly and a billion things about you incorrectly.\\
20 - And imagine the set of incorrect things are floating in an abstract n-dimensional hyperspace.\\
21 - Now imagine there was never a mirror to begin with.\\
22 - Oh, was that a doorbell?\\
23 - I didn't hear anything.\\
24 - (doorbell rings)\\
25 - Huh, there it is again.\\
26 - Sheldon, why don't you answer it?\\
27 - But I don't know who it is.\\
28 - Maybe it's a special guest who I invited just to surprise you.\\
29 - Why don't you open it up and find out.\\
30 - This is a terrible message to send to children.\\
31 - Children, you never open the door if you don't know who's on the other side.\\
32 - You always make your mommy or daddy do it while you hide under the bed and try to imagine what your superhero name will be when you avenge their deaths.\\
33 - I'll get it.\\
34 - But it can't be The Silver Shadow-- that's mine.\\
35 - Hello.\\
36 - Captain on the bridge!\\
37 - Captain on the bridge!\\
38 - You're William Shatner.\\
39 - You can call me Bill.\\
40 - Ooh, can I call you Captain?\\
41 - No.\\
42 - Please?\\
43 - No.\\
44 - (whispers): Please?\\
45 - Sure.\\
46 - And w-will you call me Science Officer Cooper?\\
47 - This has got to stop.\\
48 - I think you know how to make it stop.\\
49 - Put her there, Science Officer Cooper.\\
50 - Put her there, Science Officer Cooper.\\
51 - (Sheldon vomits)\\
52 - Oh, poor Shatner.\\
53 - Poor Shatner?\\
54 - I have to eat lunch now.\\
55 - Look, Sheldon's pretty embarrassed, so when he gets here, we should...\\
56 - Make fun of him?\\
57 - (chuckles)\\
58 - A lot.\\
59 - Guys, don't you think that's a little mean?\\
60 - Yeah.\\
61 - Okay, just so we're all on the same page.\\
62 - Yeah.\\
63 - - Hello.\\
64 - OTHERS: Hey.\\
65 - So, Sheldon, did you get William Shatner's autograph, or maybe his dry cleaning bill?\\
66 - (chuckles)\\
67 - Very funny, get it all out.\\
68 - Like you did on William Shatner?\\
69 - Raj, do you have something to add?\\
70 - You brought shame upon yourself and your family.\\
71 - It's not funny, but it's true.\\
72 - I will admit the meeting did not go the way I wanted.\\
73 - (à la Shatner): Because you barfed where no man has barfed before?\\
74 - Well, the next time I meet him, it will go better.\\
75 - Next time?\\
76 - What makes you think there's gonna be a next time?\\
77 - Wil will give me another chance.\\
78 - He thinks the world of me.\\
79 - Aw.\\
80 - One of the reasons I love you is you actually believe that.\\
81 - Thank you.\\
82 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
83 -  Then nearly   billion years ago expansion started... Wait! \\
84 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
85 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
86 -  We built the Wall \\
87 -  We built the pyramids  \\
88 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
89 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
90 -  Bang!    \\
91 - Wil Wheaton.\\
92 - Wil Wheaton.\\
93 - Wil Wheaton.\\
94 - (doorbell rings)\\
95 - Wil Wheaton.\\
96 - (doorbell rings)\\
97 - Wil Wheaton.\\
98 - (doorbell rings)\\
99 - Wil Wheaton.\\
100 - Now's not a good time, Sheldon.\\
101 - For what?\\
102 - You.\\
103 - I need to apologize.\\
104 - Apology accepted.\\
105 - MAN: Wil, come on, I cast fireball, you need to roll your dexterity save.\\
106 - I'll be right there.\\
107 - Are you playing Dungeons & Dragons?\\
108 - - No.\\
109 - MAN  : Would you hurry up, man, the map says this dungeon's full of dragons.\\
110 - Still no.\\
111 - Who are you playing with?\\
112 - Ugh...\\
113 - it's just some friends, you don't know them.\\
114 - SHATNER: Wheaton, get back here.\\
115 - Hobgoblins are at the gate, and you're at the door buying Girl Scout Cookies.\\
116 - Is that William Shat...?\\
117 - Nope.\\
118 - Hey, you guys want to read my fan fiction mash-up, "Captain Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"?\\
119 - - Nope.\\
120 - - No.\\
121 - - Certainly not.\\
122 - You don't even know what it's about.\\
123 - Is it about a superhero     who finds her voice by doing stand-up?\\
124 - That's so much better than what I had.\\
125 - Mine is just a Jewish girl that flies.\\
126 - I'd read that.\\
127 - Guys, guys, Wil Wheaton hosts a secret celebrity D&D game.\\
128 - How do you know?\\
129 - Who was there?\\
130 - Why are you damp?\\
131 - I was trying to peek in Wil's window, and he turned the sprinklers on.\\
132 - Oh, that means they must be really famous.\\
133 - I'm almost positive I heard William Shatner.\\
134 - I wonder who else is playing.\\
135 - I-I bet we can use graph theory to determine who Wil knows and who is likely to play D&D.\\
136 - Yes.\\
137 - Okay, obviously he's connected to the whole Next Gen cast...\\
138 - So this is the rest of our night, huh?\\
139 - Oh, no, this is the rest of our lives.\\
140 - And Josh Brolin gets you to every Avenger.\\
141 - Kevin Smith's in this article about celebrities who play D&D.\\
142 - Oh!\\
143 - A-And he was on Wil's podcast, so they know each other.\\
144 - G-Go on his Instagram, see if you can find anything.\\
145 - Yeah, he-he posted something an hour ago:   "#GameNight."     That looks like Wil's house.\\
146 - William Shatner, Kevin Smith-- who else could be there?\\
147 - Do you see what I see over his shoulder?\\
148 - Is that a ghost?\\
149 - I think it's Stuart.\\
150 - That is Stuart.\\
151 - What-What's he doing there?\\
152 - Maybe he died in Wil's house and he can't leave until he solves his own murder.\\
153 - Why would Wil invite Stuart and not us?\\
154 - I know the answer.\\
155 - Yeah.\\
156 - We all know the answer.\\
157 - Hey, guys.\\
158 - You're home late.\\
159 - Uh, yeah.\\
160 - I had a crazy night.\\
161 - I went to the pharmacy.\\
162 - I like to be there when the new decongestants drop.\\
163 - Cut the crap.\\
164 - We know where you were.\\
165 - We know what you were doing.\\
166 - Yeah, I just told you.\\
167 - I was at CVS breathing my ass off.\\
168 - Oh, you were breathing, all right.\\
169 - You were breathing the rarefied air of celebrities.\\
170 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
171 - Then why are you trembling?\\
172 - I'm always trembling.\\
173 - We know you were at Wil's D&D game.\\
174 - We saw you on Instagram.\\
175 - We just want to know how you got invited.\\
176 - I can't talk about it or they won't invite me back next week.\\
177 - So there's another game next week.\\
178 - I didn't mean to say that.\\
179 - Who's in it?\\
180 - I can't tell you!\\
181 - How do we get invited?\\
182 - I don't know!\\
183 - How many hit dice are they playing the wereboar as having?\\
184 - d  +   -- I mean, I don't know!\\
185 - (phone ringing)\\
186 - Hey, Stuart.\\
187 - I don't want to play anymore.\\
188 - It's too much pressure.\\
189 - Why, what happened?\\
190 - I've-I've said too much.\\
191 - You haven't said anything.\\
192 - Not to you, to them.\\
193 - Who's them?\\
194 - Ah!\\
195 - Now I have said too much!\\
196 - But y-you blocked your number, right?\\
197 - Relax,     this is not my first creepy phone call.\\
198 - It's like riding a bike...\\
199 - slowly past a girl's house.\\
200 - WHEATON (over phone): Hello.\\
201 - (imitating Shatner): Wil, Bill Shatner here.\\
202 - Is this Howard?\\
203 - Of course not.\\
204 - It-It's Shatner.\\
205 - If you don't believe me, ask my good friend, Christopher Walken.\\
206 - (imitating Walken): Hello, Bill and I are just hanging out...\\
207 - at The Polo Lounge.\\
208 - Mr.\\
209 - Shatner, Mr.\\
210 - Walken, here are your martinis.\\
211 - (glass dings)\\
212 - (whispering in normal voice): What are you doing?\\
213 - I'm filling out the world.\\
214 - You're ruining it.\\
215 - No, he's not.\\
216 - Thanks, Wil.\\
217 - Sheldon, why are you walking everywhere?\\
218 - Just get a horse.\\
219 - I had a horse.\\
220 - It got hit by a train.\\
221 - Get another one.\\
222 - I can't just replace Chauncey.\\
223 - I'm still in the grieving process.\\
224 - (phone ringing)\\
225 - Hey.\\
226 - Hey, Leonard, I have an opening in my D&D game next week, and I was wondering if you were interested in playing.\\
227 - Well, yes, thank you.\\
228 - Okay, great.\\
229 - Now, here's the thing, you can't tell anyone.\\
230 - I'm serious, not Howard, not Raj, and certainly not Sheldon.\\
231 - Okay.\\
232 - I'm really sorry to put you in a position where you have to lie to your friends...\\
233 - See you there!\\
234 - You come face to face with a massive monster with a gaping maw full of teeth, three huge legs, and flailing tentacles.\\
235 - What do you do?\\
236 - Fellas, it looks like we're facing a, an otyugh.\\
237 - Here's the plan...\\
238 - Hold on there, Bill.\\
239 - Now what, Kareem?\\
240 - How do we know it's not a Neo-otyugh?\\
241 - Same way I know the difference between an owlbear and a bugbear.\\
242 - Does that answer your question?\\
243 - No.\\
244 - Look, there's one way to settle this: we chop it up and look at the pieces.\\
245 - Oh, come on, why do you always got to attack everything?\\
246 - Why can't we just try talking to it?\\
247 - Big surprise, Podcast here wants to talk.\\
248 - What do you think, Leonard?\\
249 - I think this is the greatest day of my entire life.\\
250 - It's all right, buddy, one day you'll meet a girl.\\
251 - Hey, how was your lecture?\\
252 - Oh, it was so good.\\
253 - I-I-I mean, it-it started great, and then the, the middle was great, and then the ending was like...\\
254 - (imitates explosion)\\
255 - So great.\\
256 - Leonard, if you went to House of Pies again, just say it.\\
257 - (stammers)\\
258 - Wait, if you think I'm lying, why do you think I'm eating pies?\\
259 - Why don't you think I'm...\\
260 - having an affair?\\
261 - Listen, i-it's fine, just next time, bring me a slice.\\
262 - Okay, well, if you really want to know,     I'll tell you where I was.\\
263 - I was at Wil's D&D game, but that's all I can say.\\
264 - Oh, fun.\\
265 - Were there famous people there?\\
266 - Ah, sorry, I-I-I can't tell you that.\\
267 - Okay, well, yes, but I-I-I-I can't tell you who.\\
268 - Well, no, I-I can tell you Shatner, but that's only because you already knew that one.\\
269 - Well, I'm glad you had fun.\\
270 - Yeah.\\
271 - Ugh, I wish I could tell you who else was there.\\
272 - (chuckles)\\
273 - I can't, I promised.\\
274 - Yeah, if it makes you feel better, I couldn't care less.\\
275 - That's true, you don't care, so there's no harm in telling you.\\
276 - Okay, you really don't have to.\\
277 - All right, I'll tell you.\\
278 - Uh...\\
279 - (stammers)\\
280 - Kevin Smith was there, and-and, uh, this really tall guy named Kareem.\\
281 - Wait-wait, K-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?\\
282 - I don't know, it was, uh, Kareem something Jabbar.\\
283 - How do you know him?\\
284 - How do you not know him?\\
285 - Well, I know him now 'cause he was there.\\
286 - Wow.\\
287 - That is so cool.\\
288 - Oh, a-and that, uh, the guy that played the werewolf on-on True Blood, he was there.\\
289 - Wh-- Joe Manganiello?\\
290 - Uh, yeah.\\
291 - From Magic Mike?  What's that?\\
292 - Okay, okay, did he look... like this?\\
293 - He had his clothes on, but, yeah.\\
294 - (sighs)\\
295 - I can't believe you met Joe Manganiello.\\
296 - Is he nice?\\
297 - Oh, he's so nice.\\
298 - I-I-I rolled my dice underneath the couch, and he just lifted it up, one hand.\\
299 - Oh, I-I bet he did.\\
300 - Hi.\\
301 - Okay, can you guys keep a secret?\\
302 - Yeah.\\
303 - Sure.\\
304 - Good, 'cause I can't.\\
305 - Leonard played Dungeons & Dragons with the hot guy from Magic Mike. I never got to see that movie.\\
306 - Seriously?\\
307 - Yeah, Howie made us leave as soon as he realized it wasn't about magic.\\
308 - Well, I have seen that movie one or seven times,  and trust me, it is magic.\\
309 - - Which guy?\\
310 - - That one.\\
311 - Abracadabra.\\
312 - Hey, you know what was fun?\\
313 - That time we played Dungeons & Dragons.\\
314 - That was fun.\\
315 - We should play that more.\\
316 - Sorry, what now?\\
317 - Hey, what are you guys doing here?\\
318 - Oh, I, uh, think Sheldon might have left something.\\
319 - Oh, you mean, besides his lunch?\\
320 - (laughter)\\
321 - You are so funny, Wil.\\
322 - We were just talking about how funny you are.\\
323 - Yeah, Leonard told you, didn't he?\\
324 - - Yeah.\\
325 - Mm-hmm.\\
326 - - Yup.\\
327 - - Yeah.\\
328 - It's Manganiello?\\
329 - - Uh-huh.\\
330 - - Mm-hmm.\\
331 - - Mm-hmm.\\
332 - Feel good about yourselves?\\
333 - - Nope.\\
334 - - No.\\
335 - - Yeah.\\
336 - Oh, we're going with no?\\
337 - No.\\
338 - Hey, guys.\\
339 - What are you smiling about?\\
340 - What?\\
341 - This is my regular face.\\
342 - No, it's not.\\
343 - Y-Your regular face is more like this...\\
344 - No, no, i-it's-it's more in the eyebrows, like this...\\
345 - (chuckles)\\
346 - Okay, make your jokes.\\
347 - I'm still in a great mood.\\
348 - (phone ringing)\\
349 - Hey.\\
350 - Wait, what?\\
351 - Why?\\
352 - Oh, come on, but...\\
353 - O-Okay, fine.\\
354 - Huh, Raj was right, it is more in the eyebrows.\\
355 - What was that all about?\\
356 - Wil kicked me out of his D&D game.\\
357 - You were in Wil's D&D game?\\
358 - With William Shatner?\\
359 - And you didn't tell us?\\
360 - I'm sorry, Wil made me promise not to.\\
361 - I thought we were friends.\\
362 - Oh, come on, you guys would do the same thing.\\
363 - No, we wouldn't!\\
364 - I told you when I was in spin class with Scarlett Johansson.\\
365 - It didn't even turn out to be Scarlett Johansson.\\
366 - Well, that's her fault, not mine!\\
367 - It doesn't matter because Penny blabbed about it and now I'm out.\\
368 - So there's an open seat.\\
369 - Wil!\\
370 - Wil Wheaton!\\
371 - Open!\\
372 - Open!\\
373 - No.\\
374 - No.\\
375 - No.\\
376 - Hell no.\\
377 - Look, we know Leonard is out.\\
378 - You need to fill a seat.\\
379 - It should be one of us.\\
380 - Or give me another chance.\\
381 - I think me and Joe Manganiello were really hitting it off.\\
382 - Joe Manganiello was there?\\
383 - From Magic Mike?     You guys suck.\\
384 - Agreed.\\
385 - You guys suck.\\
386 - Let's go, Wil.\\
387 - No.\\
388 - All of you.\\
389 - You're just trying to use me to get close to my famous friends.\\
390 - Do you know how that makes me feel?\\
391 - Flattered?\\
392 - (chuckles)\\
393 - Used.\\
394 - I was gonna guess that.\\
395 - One of the worst things about being a celebrity is you never know if people like you for you.\\
396 - Well, thanks for letting me know.\\
397 - (sighs)\\
398 - You're right, that was really crappy of us.\\
399 - Yeah, I guess we just got caught up in the excitement.\\
400 - We're sorry, Wil.\\
401 - We do like you for you.\\
402 - And if it makes you feel any better, I don't even really consider you a celebrity.\\
403 - Should we go or do you want to wait for the sprinklers?\\
404 - Guys, I-I still feel a little bad about Wil.\\
405 - Me, too.\\
406 - Yeah.\\
407 - We should invite him to come play with us.\\
408 - Ask him to bring some chips because we're all out.\\
409 - (stammers)\\
410 - Hey, Wil, this is Leonard.\\
411 - (gasps)\\
412 - Make it Bugles.\\
413 - No, no, no, no, no, pretzel sticks.\\
414 - No, no, no, Bugles.\\
415 - We're gonna play some D&D and thought you might want to join us.\\
416 - Thank you, Leonard, but actually I can't do it tonight.\\
417 - Uh, how about another time?\\
418 - Okay, great.\\
419 - Thanks.\\
420 - Bye.\\
421 - Okay, where were we?\\
422 - I was about to go all Wrath of Khan on the ogres.\\
423 - Oh, man, that's it.\\
424 - Put another dollar in the Star Trek jar, Bill.\\
425 - Worth it.\\
426 - Speaking of putting dollars in things...\\
427 - I loved you in Magic Mike.     (chuckles)\\
428 - Thanks.\\
429 - (chuckles)\\
430 - Switch places with me.\\
431 - Are we playing musical chairs or Dungeons & Dragons?\\
432 - Yeah, let's teach that ogre what my broadsword tastes like.\\
433 - I like your moxie.\\
434 - Aw, and I like your grandpa words.\\
435 - My dad and I watched you win back-to-back championships.\\
436 - And I watched you sniff Joe's hair when he wasn't looking.\\
437 - Thank you again for inviting us, and don't worry, we won't tell the guys.\\
438 - You know what, why don't you tell the guys?\\
439 - In fact, let's all take a picture and send it to them right now.\\
440 - (phones buzzing)\\
441 - That's weird.\\
442 - We deserve that.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Conference Valuation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...  \\
2 - The drug I've been working on for the past five years just got approved by the FDA.  \\
3 - - Wow.\\
4 - - Oh. Congratulations.  \\
5 - Was that the decongestant you developed?  \\
6 - No, we had to rebrand that as a solvent for mining equipment.  \\
7 - It's her anti-inflammatory drug.  \\
8 - Oh.  \\
9 - Yep, three years of testing and no reported side effects.   \\
10 - - Hmm, so it works.\\
11 - - Eh.   \\
12 - Well, congratulations, I'm so happy for you.   \\
13 - Yeah, well, I'm happy for you because I want you to head up my sales team.   \\
14 - Really? Me? Don't you want someone with more experience?   \\
15 - No, the job's all yours.   \\
16 - All right, now I'm sure some of you are wondering, "Who is this woman?   \\
17 - "How did she get to be in charge of the sales team? Is it because she's friends with Dr. Rostenkowski?"   \\
18 - Because she is.   \\
19 - "Is it because she was Miss Cornhusker and still fits in those very same jeans?"   \\
20 - Because she was, and she does and they're actually a little baggy.   \\
21 - "And the absence of side effects means that Inflaminex can be taken in conjunction with other medications. It's a brand-new day."\\
22 - (exhales)   \\
23 - Such a good tagline, I forgot, who came up with that?   \\
24 - - You did.\\
25 - - That's right, I did.   \\
26 - Okay, I know it's late and I've been working you guys really hard, so I have a little treat for you.   \\
27 - - We get to go home?\\
28 - - No.   \\
29 - You get to stay here and get vitamin B   shots.   \\
30 - (team members groan)   \\
31 - Oh, my God.\\
32 - You guys are still here?   \\
33 - We're happy to be here. It's a brand-new day.   \\
34 - It's   :  , it's literally a brand-new day.   \\
35 - Everybody go home.\\
36 - (scoffs)   \\
37 - All right, fine. Go, get out of here.   \\
38 - Go on. (sighs)   \\
39 - I think things are going pretty good.   \\
40 - Are you aware that Dave's in the break room crying?   \\
41 - Yeah, I told him if he's gonna be a crybaby, go to the break room.   \\
42 - I just really want to be prepared for this conference.\\
43 - - You're gonna do great.   \\
44 - You really think so?   \\
45 - Of course; they're scared of you, you're scared of me--\\
46 - The system works.   \\
47 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
48 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
49 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
50 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
51 -  We built the Wall \\
52 -  We built the pyramids    \\
53 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
54 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
55 -  Bang!    \\
56 - Okay, Howie, I'm going.   \\
57 - - Have a great conference.\\
58 - - Thanks.   \\
59 - Remember, I'm leaving you with two babies.   \\
60 - I expect to see two babies when I get back, and they better be the same two babies because I'll know.   \\
61 - I think I'm capable of babysitting.   \\
62 - Don't call it babysitting; they're your children.   \\
63 - It's called parenting.   \\
64 - What's the difference?   \\
65 - You don't get paid.   \\
66 - Now, the emergency contacts are on the fridge and I left money for food on the table.   \\
67 - Oh, sounds like I do get paid.   \\
68 - (chuckles)   \\
69 - Don't worry.   \\
70 - I got this covered.   \\
71 - I know you do.   \\
72 - Quick question, where are the kids right now?   \\
73 - They're upstairs.   \\
74 - - They're at daycare.\\
75 - - They're at daycare?   \\
76 - - They're upstairs!\\
77 - - Why are you messing with me?!   \\
78 - (clears throat)   \\
79 - Wow. That's a lot of luggage for a weekend.   \\
80 - (groans)\\
81 - I know.   \\
82 - I didn't know what to wear, so I brought a few options.   \\
83 - Was one of the options the option to never come back?   \\
84 - (sighs)   \\
85 - (chuckles) I just really want this weekend to go well.   \\
86 - Doesn't answer my question, but okay.   \\
87 - I love you.   \\
88 - I love you, too.   \\
89 - And you're gonna do great.   \\
90 - Just relax, stay out of your head, and try to enjoy it.   \\
91 - Aw. That reminds me of what I said to you the first time we slept together.   \\
92 - I still use it.   \\
93 - - It's a mantra.\\
94 - - Yeah.   \\
95 - Oh, thank goodness!   \\
96 - I caught you before you left.    \\
97 - I'm just going for the weekend.    \\
98 - Just the weekend.    \\
99 - You all heard her say it.    \\
100 - So, your convention is in San Diego, right?    \\
101 - Yes.    \\
102 - Great. I need you to settle a bet for Amy and me.    \\
103 - I say, when it's not Comic-Con, no one will be dressed as superheroes.    \\
104 - Mm-hmm.    \\
105 - And I say fewer people will be dressed as superheroes but still some.    \\
106 - A crazy person in a cape doesn't count.    \\
107 - Mm, why not?\\
108 - It counts at Comic-Con.    \\
109 - Also, if you get a chance to sneak into Hall H, last year, I left my neck pillow under my seat.    \\
110 - Uh, third row, second from the aisle.    \\
111 - I'll see what I can do.    \\
112 - Thank you.\\
113 - At least there will be one superhero in San Diego.    \\
114 - So, Leonard, what are you gonna do while Penny's away?    \\
115 - I don't know.    \\
116 - Maybe watch a movie with subtitles.    \\
117 - If you're looking for something outside the norm, I have invented a new chess variant where the bishops can also move like knights.    \\
118 - What do you call that, Bishops Be Crazy?    \\
119 - First of all, it would be "Bishops Are Crazy."    \\
120 - Not if you're being crazy.    \\
121 - Checkmate.    \\
122 - Hey, guys.    \\
123 - - Hey.\\
124 - - Hello.    \\
125 - Where are the kids?    \\
126 - I thought they were with you.    \\
127 - - What? No! I...\\
128 - - I'm kidding.    \\
129 - They're at daycare.\\
130 - (chuckles)    \\
131 - What about me makes you think my heart can handle that joke?    \\
132 - Hey.    \\
133 - You guys want to come hang out at my place this weekend?    \\
134 - So we can help you babysit?    \\
135 - Uh, it's not babysitting.    \\
136 - They're my children.    \\
137 - They're not our children.    \\
138 - Oh. Well, for you guys, then, it is babysitting.    \\
139 - No offense, Howard, but I don't want to spend my weekend around your loud, sticky babies.    \\
140 - You can't insult my kids. I am offended.    \\
141 - N-No, you can't be. I said "no offense."    \\
142 - That's like "no backsies" but for offense.    \\
143 - What do you say? We'll play some board games.    \\
144 - It'll be like a party.    \\
145 - Three guys playing a board game doesn't sound like much of a party.    \\
146 - (chuckles) Someone doesn't remember college very well.    \\
147 - As opposed to the leading nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, our product greatly reduces the risk of ulcers.    \\
148 - So it won't burn a hole in your stomach. (chuckles)    \\
149 - And it won't burn a hole in your wallet, either!    \\
150 - Okay.\\
151 - (chuckles)    \\
152 - I got this.\\
153 - (chuckles)    \\
154 - Thank you for stopping by.    \\
155 - It's a brand-new day!    \\
156 - - See? You're doing great.\\
157 - - Yeah.    \\
158 - Mediocre actress, great drug pusher.    \\
159 - Who knew?    \\
160 - Inflaminex, huh?    \\
161 - So what can you tell me about it?    \\
162 - - Well, we...\\
163 - - Oh, don't waste your time.    \\
164 - His name is Danny. He works for one of the other drug companies.    \\
165 - Hey, nothing wrong with checking out the competition.    \\
166 - Aw, we don't see you as competition.    \\
167 - You should.    \\
168 - Our anti-inflammatory is hitting the market this year, too.    \\
169 - Well, ours has zero drug interaction risk.    \\
170 - Yeah. So does an Altoid.    \\
171 - Speaking of Altoids, why don't you go get one?    \\
172 - (chuckles):\\
173 - Okay.    \\
174 - Let's everyone calm down.    \\
175 - If you can't find a pill for that here, then you're not trying hard enough.    \\
176 - It's all right.    \\
177 - I'll go.    \\
178 - I don't know what it is about that guy, but he just gets on my nerves.    \\
179 - Well, you scared the bad man away.    \\
180 - Who's a good girl?    \\
181 - They're still asleep.    \\
182 - Apparently, when I put someone down for a nap, they sleep hard.    \\
183 - That's a weird brag, Howard.    \\
184 - (doorbell rings)    \\
185 - I'll get it.    \\
186 - Bernadette thinks I have poor parenting skills. (chuckles)    \\
187 - Maybe she's basing that on your poor husbanding skills.    \\
188 - Who can say?    \\
189 - I'm bad at a lot of things.    \\
190 - - Hello.\\
191 - - Hi.    \\
192 - Hey. I didn't think you were coming.    \\
193 - Um, I changed my mind.    \\
194 - I thought it'd be fun to spend some time with your children.    \\
195 - Where are the little scamps?    \\
196 - - "Scamps"?\\
197 - - I'm sorry.    \\
198 - Tykes. Rug rats.    \\
199 - What is the PC term these days?    \\
200 - What's going on?    \\
201 - We were in the bookstore, and I found this.    \\
202 - Experimentingwith Babies: \\
203 -    Amazing Science ProjectsYou Can Perform on Your Kid. \\
204 - You can't experiment on his kids.    \\
205 - Yeah, you're not their father.    \\
206 - You can't experiment on my kids.    \\
207 - (sighs) Fine. Can I at least play a game with them?    \\
208 - Perhaps...    \\
209 - How Developed is Your Peripheral Vision?    \\
210 - Mine's great.\\
211 - I saw that.    \\
212 - You know, these experiments are pretty harmless.    \\
213 - There's one where you just put the baby in front of a mirror and you watch them watch themselves.    \\
214 - That sounds adorable.\\
215 - Let me see.    \\
216 - How come when she talks about experiments on babies, you think it's adorable, but when I do it, everyone gets upset?    \\
217 - I think I can speak for all of us.    \\
218 - You're just creepy.    \\
219 - No offense.    \\
220 - Hey, this one we can do with both Michael and Halley.    \\
221 - It's called Grabby Hands.    \\
222 - Wasn't that your nickname in high school?    \\
223 - No, it was Mama's Boy.    \\
224 - But the joke was on them, because I love my mom.    \\
225 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Guys, listen, you secure them both in car seats and slowly spin a toy at the end of the string above them.    \\
226 - The younger baby tends to reach with either hand, and the older baby prefers the dominant hand.    \\
227 - That is kind of interesting.    \\
228 - And it's not really experimenting on the kids.    \\
229 - It's more like experimenting with the kids.    \\
230 - AMY: Well, I guess if you think about it, it's kind of like playing games with them.    \\
231 - WOLOWITZ: Okay, you know what, when they wake up, we can try one or two of these.    \\
232 - (gasps)\\
233 - Yay!    \\
234 - (loudly): I said, "Yay!"    \\
235 - Thank you.\\
236 - It's a brand-new day.    \\
237 - Wow, we got a pretty good crowd here.    \\
238 - I know. But not as big as that booth.    \\
239 - What's going on over there?    \\
240 - Yeah, that's Chantix.    \\
241 - Ray Liotta's signing autographs until  :  .    \\
242 - (phone ringing)    \\
243 - Hey, I thought we weren't supposed to have our phones in the booth.    \\
244 - That's a "you" rule, not a "me" rule.    \\
245 - Hey, can I help you?    \\
246 - Actually, I'm looking for the bathroom.    \\
247 - Ah, yes. It's right next to the laxative booth.    \\
248 - (laughs) Clever, right?    \\
249 - So we meet again.    \\
250 - Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right?\\
251 - How's your launch going?    \\
252 - Good.    \\
253 - Is Dr. Rostenkowski around?    \\
254 - No, she stepped out for a call, although I wouldn't be surprised if she's in line to meet Ray Liotta.    \\
255 - Yeah. Something tells me she's not crazy about me.    \\
256 - Yeah. Something tells me that, too, and it was her.    \\
257 - Well, it doesn't matter, I was actually hoping to talk to you.    \\
258 - - Really?\\
259 - - Yeah.    \\
260 - You've done a terrific job with Inflaminex.    \\
261 - We're always on the lookout for great salespeople.    \\
262 - I think we could make you happy.    \\
263 - Uh, thanks, but I'm pretty happy.    \\
264 - - I could be more happy.\\
265 - - Tell it to your shrink, Karen.    \\
266 - Hey, Howie, everything okay?    \\
267 - Yeah, everything's great.    \\
268 - I was just wondering if we had any large barbecue tongs.    \\
269 - Uh, bottom left drawer.\\
270 - Are you guys grilling?    \\
271 - Nope, just playing games with the kids.    \\
272 - Why do you need tongs?    \\
273 - Love you, too, bye.    \\
274 - I-I bet Michael grabs it before Halley.    \\
275 - (Halley and Neil cooing)\\
276 - Not a chance.    \\
277 - Halley's a year older, you know she's gonna get it first.    \\
278 - I just think he wants it more. Come on.    \\
279 - Come on, you got this. You got this, Michael    \\
280 - Grab it. Grab it, Halley. I believe in you.    \\
281 - Oh! That was so close.\\
282 - Just keep on trying.    \\
283 - Hey. Hey, y-you guys want to make this more interesting?    \\
284 - By establishing a double-blind protocol so we have a foundation to publish? Yes.    \\
285 - Look, here's my card. Maybe we can get a drink this weekend.    \\
286 - Oh, I don't know.\\
287 - I'm pretty busy.    \\
288 - I have to inventory all the giveaways.    \\
289 - Hey, beat it. Shoo.    \\
290 - So what did he want?    \\
291 - - Nothing.\\
292 - - He offered her a job.    \\
293 - No one likes a tattletale, Karen.    \\
294 - So, what's up, traitor?    \\
295 - Dammit, Karen.    \\
296 - Okay, you want to engage the babies.    \\
297 - The subjects.    \\
298 - - The babies.\\
299 - - Fine. The babies.    \\
300 - Baby-A and Baby-B.    \\
301 - Engage them for a minute and take note of their reactions.    \\
302 - There's something familiar about all this.    \\
303 - Okay, go.    \\
304 - Hello, baby.    \\
305 - Are you having a pleasant day?    \\
306 - Oh, my G-- This is my entire childhood.    \\
307 - Leonard, Leonard, you're tainting my data.    \\
308 - Uh, it's like word for word.    \\
309 - How much time is left?\\
310 -    seconds.    \\
311 - Oh really?\\
312 - He's not reacting at all.    \\
313 - Sheldon, he's a baby.    \\
314 - That's not how you talk to him, okay? J-Just watch.    \\
315 - Hey.    \\
316 - Halley.    \\
317 - (baby talk): Who's your favorite uncle?    \\
318 - HALLEY: (giggles) Unka Koo.    \\
319 - I got a dud, let's switch.    \\
320 - Keep trying. It's for science.    \\
321 - LEONARD: Is that all I was to her?    \\
322 - Just an experiment?    \\
323 - Michael. Michael, you're making me look bad.    \\
324 - I-Interact with me.    \\
325 - (gasps) He grabbed my finger.    \\
326 - Oh, he's smiling.\\
327 - I'm doing it.    \\
328 - - That's time.\\
329 - - Oh, really?    \\
330 - Can we do one more?    \\
331 - I think these guys need to get some food.    \\
332 - By pushing a lever at the end of an obstacle course that we design?    \\
333 - No, by opening the door to a hangar and letting the airplane fly in.    \\
334 - Although, Sheldon, maybe it could be an experiment.    \\
335 - Are you suggesting we color-code their food so we can examine their diapers later?    \\
336 - Sure.    \\
337 - These diapers are gonna be full of data.    \\
338 - I never thought I would see Sheldon enjoying himself around babies so much.    \\
339 - Yeah, how about that?    \\
340 - So he just happened to stumble upon a book about experimenting with them the same day we were hanging out with Howard's kids?    \\
341 - Yep, don't overthink it.    \\
342 - LEONARD: Oh, my God.    \\
343 - At sleepaway camp my cabin was called "Control Group."    \\
344 - I can't believe you took his business card.    \\
345 - I can't believe we're still talking about this.    \\
346 - He handed it to me. What was I supposed to do?    \\
347 - Hand it back to him and tell him to stick it where the sun don't shine.    \\
348 - You are not serious.    \\
349 - Serious as the hepatitis their cholesterol medication gave thousands of people.    \\
350 - Did it?    \\
351 - Maybe.    \\
352 - You're not really considering this, are you?    \\
353 - I don't know. It's kinda flattering.    \\
354 - Please, he's just using you to get to me.    \\
355 - Or he's trying to get to me because I'm really good at my job.    \\
356 - (scoffs) Don't be so naive.    \\
357 - They're our number one competitor.    \\
358 - They have a rival drug coming out with a name I wish we thought of-- Forsootha.    \\
359 - It's got "soothe" right in it.    \\
360 - How did we miss that?    \\
361 - You know, our brand recognition is three times higher than theirs.    \\
362 - And I did that with a stupid product name and no assistant.    \\
363 - You only have this job because I gave it to you.    \\
364 - You know who else was begging you to head up their sales team?\\
365 - Nobody.    \\
366 - Well, you know who's begging me now? Danny.    \\
367 - I can't believe this is how you thank me.    \\
368 - I thanked you by thanking you.    \\
369 - And I sent you that fancy box of pears.    \\
370 - What am I supposed to do with    pears?    \\
371 - Have a pear party?    \\
372 - Ooh, a juicy pear.    \\
373 - Where are the kids?    \\
374 - Oh, Sheldon's helping Howard give them a bath.    \\
375 - Hmm. So you really think    \\
376 - you can trick Sheldon into liking babies?    \\
377 - I slept with him; I married him.    \\
378 - You want to be against me?    \\
379 - Oh, you were right, Amy.    \\
380 - There were so many valuable experiments to perform on them during bath time.    \\
381 - You don't say.    \\
382 - I do. I tested their object permanence with a rubber duck, and we took a run at Archimedes water displacement, but that went right over their heads.    \\
383 - Well, I'm glad you had a good day.    \\
384 - I did.\\
385 - It's so funny, we did all these experiments on them and they didn't even notice.    \\
386 - I know, I was worried it would be obvious, but it wasn't.    \\
387 - I guess we should go and let Howard get them ready for bed.    \\
388 - Yeah. Do you think he'd let us come back and do some more?    \\
389 - Maybe we could take them to the park.    \\
390 - (gasps) Smart.\\
391 - There'll be more babies.    \\
392 - It's a bigger sample size.    \\
393 - Where did Leonard go?    \\
394 - Just tell me the truth, Mother.    \\
395 - Was my whole childhood just one big experiment?    \\
396 - BEVERLY (on phone): Of course not, dear.    \\
397 - It was thousands of small experiments.    \\
398 - So that's all I was to you, a-a test subject?    \\
399 - No, you were my baby and I found you fascinating.    \\
400 - Really?    \\
401 - Yes, watching you develop, tracking your progress.    \\
402 - I know I'm not the warmest of parents, but it was time we spent together, and, honestly, those are some of my fondest memories.    \\
403 - When did you stop?    \\
404 - Oh, I can't tell you, the experiment isn't over.    \\
405 - Zangen's a fine company.    \\
406 - They got a couple of good drugs, but we control   % of the market.    \\
407 - Hell, commissions on just our fungal creams will put you in a new Mercedes.    \\
408 - Danny. Danny, look at me.    \\
409 - Does this face sell fungal creams?    \\
410 - No. This face is cholesterol drugs and above.    \\
411 - Playing hard to get, huh?    \\
412 - (laughs) No one's ever accused me of that before.    \\
413 - Look, why don't I just give you a number and see what you think?    \\
414 - Ooh, are-are you gonna write it on a napkin and slide it over to me?    \\
415 - No, I was just gonna say it.    \\
416 - - Aw.\\
417 - - Do you want me to write it on a napkin and slide it over to you?    \\
418 - Yah.    \\
419 - You got it.    \\
420 - Danny, you rat b*st*rd.    \\
421 - What? I'm just making your friend an offer.    \\
422 - Yeah, he's writing it on a napkin like in the movies.    \\
423 - (scoffs) That's not an offer.    \\
424 - Do you know how amazing this girl is?    \\
425 - - Aw. You think I'm amazing?\\
426 - - Stay out of this.    \\
427 - I'm serious..    \\
428 - Not only is she a helluva salesperson, she's the hardest worker I've ever seen.    \\
429 - I know, that's why I'm trying to steal her from you.    \\
430 - Well, then you're gonna have to do a lot better than this, because I promise you, I'm not gonna let her go without a fight.    \\
431 - You do not want that, she's a biter.    \\
432 - Just think about it.    \\
433 - You know, I don't have to.    \\
434 - Thanks, but I'm happy where I am.    \\
435 - Let's go.    \\
436 - Can I just see what he wrote on the napkin?    \\
437 - What napkin?    \\
438 - You know, spending time with Michael and Halley today really made me think about our future children.    \\
439 - Huh, what an interesting and completely unforeseen development.    \\
440 - What are you thinking?    \\
441 - Well, I just can't decide.    \\
442 - Either five sets of triplets or three sets of quintuplets.    \\
443 - You know what? It doesn't matter as long as they're healthy.    \\
444 - And divisible by three.    \\
445 - That's a lot of babies, Sheldon.    \\
446 - Oh, only for humans.    \\
447 - For frogs, it's just a drop in the bucket.    \\
448 - Well, I'm sorry I'm not a frog.    \\
449 - Oh, don't feel bad, Amy.    \\
450 - You're good enough for me.
\subsection {Episode 18: The Laureate Accumulation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - We just published a few months ago.\\
3 - How did you have time to design an experiment?\\
4 - This whole thing is actually a gigantic accident.\\
5 - You weren't even thinking about super-asymmetry?\\
6 - Thinking about it?\\
7 - (chuckles)\\
8 - We don't even understand it.\\
9 - (both laugh)\\
10 - Uh, can you believe this?\\
11 - Doctors Pemberton and Campbell have been doing a press tour trying to take credit for super-asymmetry.\\
12 - So what?\\
13 - I mean, no one's gonna give them credit for accidentally discovering something.\\
14 - WOLOWITZ: Yeah, who remembers the guy who was trying to find India and discovered America instead?\\
15 - What was his name again?\\
16 - (chuckles)\\
17 - Now stop trying to steal our Nobel Prize.\\
18 - You come up with your own idea.\\
19 - Yeah, that's not gonna happen.\\
20 - ELLEN (over TV): Have a seat, thanks for being here.\\
21 - I feel the same way about you.\\
22 - This is nice.\\
23 - All my friends hanging out, watching Ellen. It's like, what am I gonna do with my other two wishes?\\
24 - It's not nice.\\
25 - She's having on the scientists who are trying to steal our Nobel Prize.\\
26 - Although I will enjoy watching her expose Pemberton and Campbell for the coattail-riding frauds that they are.\\
27 - That is Ellen's brand, gotcha journalism.\\
28 - Yeah, you should've seen her take down John Krasinski last week.\\
29 - Got him to admit he loved his wife.\\
30 - It was brutal.\\
31 - (shushing)\\
32 - All right, our next guests are a couple of physicists-- don't turn the channel.\\
33 - They've been doing some viral videos online about what it's like to be in the running for a Nobel Prize.\\
34 - Please welcome Doctors Greg Pemberton and Kevin Campbell.\\
35 - (cheering, applause)\\
36 - Why does she even want to have scientists on?\\
37 - Uh, silly question.\\
38 - Who else will give her audience causal explanations of natural phenomena?\\
39 - I love you, honey, but think.\\
40 - So you guys have discovered something pretty amazing in the universe.\\
41 - Obviously, I understand, uh, high-level physics because I'm a comedian, but...\\
42 - (laughter)\\
43 - ...can you explain it to the audience?\\
44 - Well, I don't know, I'm not sure we're even smart enough to understand it.\\
45 - (laughter)\\
46 - Look, look, the audience is laughing at them.\\
47 - It's starting.\\
48 - I hate to say it, Sheldon, but I think the audience likes them.\\
49 - Well, that will all change when Ellen asks them how super-asymmetry explains the cosmological excess of matter over anti-matter and they panic, like Leonard trying to do a pull-up.\\
50 - Hey, what'd I do?\\
51 - Not a pull-up.\\
52 - People have been loving your videos, especially the-the songs that you've been posting.\\
53 - - Oh, thanks.\\
54 - - Thank you.\\
55 - Uh, this may be pushing it, but I have to ask.\\
56 - Would you mind singing one of those for us right now?\\
57 - - Oh, why not?\\
58 - - All right.\\
59 - Come on, Ellen, they're right there.\\
60 - Go for the jugular.\\
61 -  Let's get physicist, physicist   \\
62 -  I want to get physicist    \\
63 -  Let's get into physicist    \\
64 -  Let me hear your boson talk   \\
65 - Come on, Ellen.\\
66 -  Let me hear your boson talk...    \\
67 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
68 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
69 - Wait!\\
70 -   \\
71 -  The Earth began to cool   \\
72 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools   \\
73 -  We built the Wall  \\
74 -  We built the pyramids   \\
75 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
76 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
77 -  Bang!    \\
78 - Dr. Pemberton.\\
79 - Dr. Campbell.\\
80 - Doctors Pemberton and Campbell.\\
81 - Morning, buddy.\\
82 - I am not your buddy.\\
83 - - What's wrong?\\
84 - - I'll tell you what's wrong.\\
85 - You went on TV and were charming.\\
86 - Thanks, man.\\
87 - That's what my mom said.\\
88 - PEMBERTON: W-Why don't you come in and have some parfait?\\
89 - Yeah, we ordered it from room service; it cost, like, bucks.\\
90 - It's just yogurt in a glass.\\
91 - I don't want your yogurt.\\
92 - Then what do you want?\\
93 - I want you to hold a press conference where you admit that you blindly stumbled into super-asymmetry and it was really our discovery.\\
94 - Oh.\\
95 - No, thanks.\\
96 - You know, just because we proved something by accident doesn't mean we didn't prove it.\\
97 - PEMBERTON: Yeah, I wasn't trying to prove that my wife was cheating on me when I came home early one Friday, but I'm still sleeping on his couch.\\
98 - I told you, you can do better than her.\\
99 - Thanks.\\
100 - It just hurts.\\
101 - And when you win that Nobel Prize, she's gonna realize that she was wrong, you are not a fraud.\\
102 - She is not wrong.\\
103 - Wow, I can't believe you're siding with Linda.\\
104 - Shame on you.\\
105 - Look at this.\\
106 - They posted another video.\\
107 - It's not even about science.\\
108 - They're on a celebrity bus tour.\\
109 - Those are fun.\\
110 - I-I went on one and saw Tom Hanks talking to his gardener.\\
111 - He's even nice when you plant the wrong color azaleas.\\
112 - Those guys are good at self-promoting, so what?\\
113 - No one ever won a Nobel for being nice.\\
114 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah, but if they did, do you know who would win one?\\
115 - Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?\\
116 - He picked up a shovel and helped the guy replant.\\
117 - SIEBERT: Dr. Cooper, there you are.\\
118 - I just wanted to tell you not to worry about this Pemberton and Campbell publicity blitz.\\
119 - Are you worried?\\
120 - Not at all.\\
121 - Not even a little bit.\\
122 - (laughs)\\
123 - Look, i-it doesn't matter if they have popular support, we're gonna get the scientific community behind us.\\
124 - He's right, the Nobel Prize is about the work, and as your fellow scientists, we support you and Amy.\\
125 - That's great, Scooby Gang.\\
126 - Now, the university is gonna host a reception for you and Dr. Fowler where we invite as many academic luminaries as we can, uh, give them a chance to meet you, hear about your work.\\
127 - Uh, that's a great idea.\\
128 - Uh, yeah.\\
129 - Who needs to be likable when you have Nobel Laureates campaigning for you?\\
130 - Oh, yeah-- wait a minute.\\
131 - Do you not think we're likable?\\
132 - That's what's great about you, you never stop asking the tough questions.\\
133 - (door closes)\\
134 - Hey.\\
135 - Kids asleep?\\
136 - Nope.\\
137 - I've been trying to get them down for hours.\\
138 - Apparently, Halley's afraid of the dark now and I can't turn on the night-light 'cause it makes Michael cry.\\
139 - Why doesn't he like the night-light?\\
140 - Jot that down, we can ask him     as soon as he learns to speak.\\
141 - We can also find out what's so damn funny about birds.\\
142 - (Halley fusses)\\
143 - I'll go talk to her.\\
144 - I don't know why she's suddenly so afraid of everything.\\
145 - Honey, remember, she's my child, too.\\
146 - WOLOWITZ (over monitor): Hey, sweetie, I heard you were afraid of the dark.\\
147 - I know someone else who was afraid of the dark once.\\
148 - Your daddy, when he was in space.\\
149 - (Wolowitz chuckles)\\
150 - And just like you, I was wearing a full diaper.\\
151 - Hey, good news.\\
152 - They're inviting several Nobel Laureates to our reception.\\
153 - Oh, great, like who?\\
154 - Uh...\\
155 - Makoto Kobayashi.\\
156 - Da-- ooh.\\
157 - What?\\
158 - Well, I may have been less than kind to him about his Nobel Prize win.\\
159 - Why?\\
160 - I was jealous, angry and new to Twitter.\\
161 - It was a dangerous combination.\\
162 - Okay, so scratch Kobayashi.\\
163 - Uh, George Smoot's on here.\\
164 - (hisses, groans)\\
165 - We have a history.\\
166 - Saul Perlmutter?\\
167 - (groans): Oh!\\
168 - What about Kip Thorne?\\
169 - (stammers)\\
170 - That was a misunderstanding.\\
171 - I didn't know he was right behind me.\\
172 - So you've alienated everyone we need to help us?\\
173 - Well, Amy, if I had known that someday we'd need them, I would never have insulted them.\\
174 - - Well, that doesn't make it better.\\
175 - - Oh.\\
176 - Well, it's also not true.\\
177 - (door opens, closes)\\
178 - - Hey.\\
179 - - Hey.\\
180 - Oh, that's cute.\\
181 - Did Halley draw that at preschool?\\
182 - I drew it.\\
183 - Well, good night.\\
184 - It's supposed to be an astronaut.\\
185 - And I'm supposed to be living on my own at this age, but here we are.\\
186 - Halley was scared and Howard told her the sweetest story about when he was in space and I thought I could turn it into a book for her and Michael.\\
187 - Oh, well, I mean, I am an artist.\\
188 - Uh, i-if you want, I could do the drawings.\\
189 - Really?\\
190 - That'd be amazing.\\
191 - Yeah, it'd be fun.\\
192 - And a,     a nice change of pace from what I usually draw.\\
193 - What do you usually draw?\\
194 - Well, good night.\\
195 - (device chimes)\\
196 - - Someone texting you?\\
197 - - Uh, no, I just met my exercise goal for the day.\\
198 - By doing the dishes?\\
199 - Hey, you have your goals, I have mine.\\
200 - - Hello.\\
201 - - What are you two doing?\\
202 - Mm, just finishing a workout.\\
203 - What's up?\\
204 - Do you have any cookie dough?\\
205 - Uh, I think so.\\
206 - Let me see.\\
207 - Yeah, we've got, uh, chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin.\\
208 - Oatmeal raisin?\\
209 - I know at least two things wrong with that cookie.\\
210 - It's for the Nobel Laureates.\\
211 - We need them on our side, but unfortunately, Sheldon...\\
212 - No.\\
213 - "Unfortunately, Sheldon..." that's all you got to say.\\
214 - Well, that's-- so you need these people's support and you're sending them baked goods?\\
215 - Yeah, they're pretty smart.\\
216 - Don't you think they're gonna realize it's just a bribe?\\
217 - No, you'd think, but sometimes brilliant people can be painfully oblivious to social cues.\\
218 - Thank you for pointing that out, Sheldon.\\
219 - Anytime.\\
220 - "Sheldon Cooper"?\\
221 - Hmm.\\
222 - "Sheldon Cooper"?\\
223 - (scoffs)\\
224 - Pass.\\
225 - "Sheldon Cooper." Aw.\\
226 - Ugh, oatmeal raisin?\\
227 - Ugh.\\
228 - (phone chimes)\\
229 - Oh, it's from Saul Perlmutter.\\
230 - (gasps)\\
231 - He sent me a picture.\\
232 - Ooh, let me see.\\
233 - Oh, he arranged the cookies to spell out "thank you." Sheldon, that word isn't "thank."   \\
234 - (knock on door)\\
235 - Hi.\\
236 - I got you a surprise.\\
237 - What-- Oh.\\
238 - (chuckles)\\
239 - What's the occasion?\\
240 - I heard you tell Halley that story the other night, and I thought it was so sweet that Stuart and I turned it into a book.\\
241 - The Frightened Little Astronaut? That looks just like you.\\
242 - Look how tiny and scared you look.\\
243 - And the best part is, Stuart showed it to a publisher friend of his, and they're interested in it.\\
244 - - That is so cool.\\
245 - - Absolutely not.\\
246 - Why?\\
247 - Because I don't want the whole world to know I was the frightened little astronaut!\\
248 - Maybe you should've called it The Bitchy Little Astronaut. You want to tell me what's going on?\\
249 - Is my distress that obvious?\\
250 - Sheldon, please don't take this the wrong way, but when you're quiet even for a second, something's wrong.\\
251 - Well, it's true.\\
252 - The fact is, I feel really bad for Amy.\\
253 - Well, we all do.\\
254 - But just for fun, why do you? Well, she didn't do anything wrong, but she's paying for my mistakes.\\
255 - Wow.\\
256 - What?\\
257 - No-- I'm just honestly impressed.\\
258 - When did you start caring about other people's feelings?\\
259 - Well, I laughed when Amy got a shock from the broken Christmas tree lights, so it was after that.\\
260 - So none of them are coming to the reception?\\
261 - I don't think so.\\
262 - Okay, what did he say that was so insulting?\\
263 - (sighs)\\
264 - Well, he may have suggested there was an inelegance to the quadrupole normalization of Smoot's data.\\
265 - Damn.\\
266 - See, sometimes I wish I could invent a time machine, so I could go back and prevent myself from acting so rashly.\\
267 - Or moving forward, you could think before you speak.\\
268 - I suppose so.\\
269 - But the time machine thing is probably more likely.\\
270 - My problem is that I don't always know     when I've gone too far.\\
271 - Well, uh, if you like, I could try to help you out.\\
272 - You know, and maybe let you know if you're crossing a line.\\
273 - Oh, you mean, like, with a code word?\\
274 - Sure.\\
275 - How's "shut up"?\\
276 - That's perfect.\\
277 - People say it to me all the time, no one will suspect.\\
278 - - Hey, got a minute?\\
279 - - Sure.\\
280 - What's up?\\
281 - Uh, Bernadette said you weren't crazy about the book.\\
282 - No.\\
283 - (chuckles)\\
284 - It's great.\\
285 - I just don't want anyone to ever see it or read it or know it exists.\\
286 - But this could be really good for me, you know?\\
287 - Finally get my artwork published.\\
288 - And-and come on, it's a, it's a cute story.\\
289 - Oh, easy for you to say.\\
290 - No one's gonna think you're a coward.\\
291 - Are you kidding?\\
292 - The other day in the comic book store, a balloon popped and I threw up.\\
293 - Can't you just take my name off it?\\
294 - No, uh, the only reason the publisher's interested is 'cause a real astronaut wrote it.\\
295 - Well, look, what if we made a few changes?\\
296 - Uh, sure, yes.\\
297 - - What-what do you have in mind?\\
298 - - Well, nothing major.\\
299 - But see here on the cover, where it says "frightened little," what if, I don't know, it didn't say that?\\
300 - So, it would just be The Astronaut? Yeah, you're right.\\
301 - That doesn't quite pop.\\
302 - What about...\\
303 - The Brave Astronaut? See, that's got some zip to it!\\
304 - Okay.\\
305 - And here on this page, where I'm crying.\\
306 - What if, instead, I'm... punching a meteor into the sun with my bare fists?\\
307 - So you have superpowers?\\
308 - I like the way you're thinking.\\
309 - Professor Thorne?\\
310 - Dr. Hofstadter.\\
311 - Uh, you know my wife, Penny.\\
312 - - Sure.\\
313 - Hi.\\
314 - - PENNY: Hi.\\
315 - (laughs)\\
316 - Uh, we wanted to talk to you about Dr. Cooper.\\
317 - Now, before you say no...\\
318 - No.\\
319 - Well, then, after you say no.\\
320 - No.\\
321 - Okay, look, Sheldon's a pain in the ass.\\
322 - But Dr. Fowler's really nice.\\
323 - So if you average them out-- math...\\
324 - ...you got someone who's okay.\\
325 - (stammers)\\
326 - But more than the person, the Nobel is about the work.\\
327 - You should understand that more than anyone.\\
328 - Yes, because of your work on gravitational waves.\\
329 - You know my work?\\
330 - I do.\\
331 - But I'm-I'm really hogging this conversation.\\
332 - Leonard?\\
333 - (clears throat)\\
334 - Just give them a chance.\\
335 - Uh, science has a history of difficult people.\\
336 - Look at, uh, Newton, who was a jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz, who was a jerk to everyone.\\
337 - Yeah, you know, and I don't need to tell you that gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of space-time.\\
338 - Or that the-- Hey, you worked on the movie Interstellar? \\
339 - So what do you think?\\
340 - I think if you were in space without a shirt on, you'd die.\\
341 - Oh.\\
342 - No, I am wearing a shirt.\\
343 - It's just skintight, so you can see my pecs.\\
344 - When did you get pecs?\\
345 - Yesterday, when I made Stuart add them.\\
346 - Howie, what I liked about the other story was that it was real.\\
347 - I mean, nothing in this actually happened to you.\\
348 - (chuckles): So, it's a children's book.\\
349 - I mean, cats don't wear hats.\\
350 - And if someone gives you green eggs, it ends with you on the toilet trying to make a deal with God.\\
351 - But the real story was so sweet.\\
352 - The little astronaut was afraid, but he still went to space, and that's what made him brave.\\
353 - (scoffs)\\
354 - But in space, the other astronauts...\\
355 - made fun of him, and that's a thing he doesn't want to relive.\\
356 - I get that.\\
357 - I guess it would just take a really brave man to put an embarrassing story like that out into the world, just so it might help some frightened children not feel so alone.\\
358 - Wow.\\
359 - That is quite the guilt trip.\\
360 - Are you sure you're not Jewish?\\
361 - I'm just a wife that is so proud of her husband, and doesn't think that he has anything     \\
362 - - to be embarrassed about.\\
363 - - Oh.\\
364 - You're sounding less and less Jewish.\\
365 - Hey, we just heard that you're the ones who convinced the Nobel Laureates to come.\\
366 - - Thank you.\\
367 - - PENNY: You are welcome.\\
368 - You guys deserve this.\\
369 - Yeah, now get out of here, go talk to some smart people.\\
370 - - Wait a minute.\\
371 - - Yeah, sorry.\\
372 - Sometimes I forget you're smart because you're so sexy.\\
373 - - I can see that.\\
374 - - Yeah.\\
375 - Dr. Cooper.\\
376 - Dr. Fowler.\\
377 - I was just telling Professor Arnold how you came up with super-asymmetry at your wedding.\\
378 - It's a wonderful story.\\
379 - Ha, it really is.\\
380 - I wouldn't say it was the highlight of the wedding, because I've been told not to for reasons I don't fully understand.\\
381 - Uh, but what he does understand is how the universe works, and that's what's important.\\
382 - Not what comes out of his mouth.\\
383 - (laughs)\\
384 - Uh-oh.\\
385 - I haven't been to a lot of parties like this, but what does a physics rumble look like?\\
386 - - Kind of like angry chickens.\\
387 - - Hmm.\\
388 - Or-or-or-or like, uh, when-when puppets fight.\\
389 - Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler, good to see you.\\
390 - What are you doing here?\\
391 - Professor Smoot invited us.\\
392 - - We're Facebook friends.\\
393 - - Smooty!\\
394 - Well, this is our reception, so go away.\\
395 - SHELDON: Actually, Amy, I think we should let them stay.\\
396 - Please, enjoy yourselves.\\
397 - Try some pigs in blankets.\\
398 - And yes, that is the plural.\\
399 - - Great.\\
400 - - Thanks.\\
401 - What are you doing?\\
402 - If they stay, everyone will see that their grasp on super-asymmetry is tenuous at best.\\
403 - Oh.\\
404 - That's clever.\\
405 - Yeah, I don't just know the plurals of things, Amy.\\
406 - Is this gonna be a problem?\\
407 - Mm?\\
408 - No, no, no.\\
409 - We have a plan.\\
410 - Uh, Dr. Campbell and Pemberton, settle a bet for Dr. Fowler and me?\\
411 - We were just discussing, under what conditions the radiative corrections to super-asymmetry could cause time variation of alpha E.M.?\\
412 - AMY: I say active galactic nuclei at cosmological distances show a part per million deviation.\\
413 - Dr. Cooper says     this has been disproven recently with quasar observations.\\
414 - What do you think?\\
415 - I agree with you. \\
416 - Good answer.\\
417 - Hey, uh, if we haven't said it before, we just want to say... thank you.\\
418 - Yeah.\\
419 - We couldn't have proven super-asymmetry without you.\\
420 - Wait-wait.\\
421 - You all heard them say it.\\
422 - They didn't do anything.\\
423 - - Sheldon.\\
424 - Shut up.\\
425 - - Yeah-- Well, that's rude.\\
426 - No.\\
427 - Shut up.\\
428 - Oh, the code word, thank you.\\
429 - You know, it's strange.\\
430 - A few months ago, nobody paid any attention to us, and now all of a sudden, we're getting all these accolades.\\
431 - Yeah, have-have any of you ever felt like maybe you didn't deserve it?\\
432 - Leonard, there's something I need to say.\\
433 - - Shut up.\\
434 - - Okay.\\
435 - It's crazy.\\
436 - We conclusively proved super-asymmetry, and yet somehow we, we still feel like imposters.\\
437 - There should be a term for that.\\
438 - Oh, for crying out loud, there is a term for that!\\
439 - It's called "imposter syndrome" and you don't have it!\\
440 - Because you can't have it if you are imposters, and you are! \\
441 - We're the ones who discovered super-asymmetry!\\
442 - So if anyone's gonna feel like they have imposter syndrome, it's us, because we're not imposters!\\
443 - They are!\\
444 - You're imposters and you're frauds!\\
445 - - Is that what I would've sounded like?\\
446 - - Yeah.\\
447 - Yikes!\\
448 - "Once upon a time, there was a little astronaut who was sitting in a rocket waiting to go to space." \\
449 - MAN (over radio): Three... two... one...\\
450 - WOLOWITZ: And while all the other astronauts laughed and joked, he stayed quiet, because he had a secret. He was scared. He had another secret, too. He was only pretending to be scared to trick the alien king. Ha-ha!\\
451 - BERNADETTE: Howie.\\
452 - Fine.\\
453 - There was no alien.\\
454 - (chuckles)\\
455 - There was a bossy wife, though.\\
456 - We'll get to her later.
\subsection {Episode 19: The Inspiration Deprivation}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...\\
2 - We conclusively proved super-asymmetry, and yet somehow we-we still feel like imposters.\\
3 - Yeah, there should be a term for that.\\
4 - Oh, for crying out loud, there is a term for that!\\
5 - It's called "imposter syndrome," and you don't have it, because you can't have it if you are imposters, and you are!\\
6 - We're the ones who discovered super-asymmetry, so if anyone's gonna feel like they have imposter syndrome, it's us, because we're not imposters, they are!\\
7 - You're imposters and you're frauds!\\
8 - Is that what I would've sounded like?\\
9 - - Yeah.\\
10 - - Yikes.\\
11 - Sheldon, look at this.\\
12 -  (stammers)  Wait a minute.\\
13 - How do I know this isn't one of those joke phones that squirts water in my face?\\
14 - Because that's not even a thing.\\
15 - Look.\\
16 - You got called into human resources?\\
17 - I'm sure it's because I insulted Pemberton and Campbell in a room full of Nobel Laureates.\\
18 - You did do that.\\
19 - It was awkward.\\
20 - People didn't know where to look.\\
21 - This is a twist.\\
22 - Usually you're the one getting called into H.R.\\
23 -  KOOTHRAPPALI:  Yeah, now it's Amy.\\
24 - Who knew you were married to such a bad girl.\\
25 - I suppose the signs were always there.\\
26 - I mean, she did recently go to that rave at the mall.\\
27 - It was a Spencer's Gifts.\\
28 - There was music and a strobe light.\\
29 - If that isn't a rave, then I don't know what one is.\\
30 - You don't know what one is.\\
31 - Guys, come on, I think I'm in trouble.\\
32 - It's no big deal.\\
33 - I used to get called into H.R. all the time.\\
34 - Ms. Davis is great.\\
35 - Pro tip: if you find strong women sexy, do not say it out loud.\\
36 -  (phone chimes)  Oh!\\
37 - She wants to see me, too.\\
38 - All right, let's get our story straight: This is all your fault.\\
39 - Relax.\\
40 - You're probably just gonna get a slap on the wrist.\\
41 - Maybe, but do not ask for that, on the wrist or anywhere else.\\
42 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
43 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started...\\
44 - Wait!\\
45 -      The Earth began to cool   \\
46 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools   \\
47 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids   \\
48 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery   \\
49 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
50 -  Bang!    \\
51 - Thank you both for coming.\\
52 - President Siebert asked that I be a part of this conversation    to help us calmly discuss what went wrong    and how we can better move forward.\\
53 - We are not here to point fingers, so, Dr. Cooper, please stop that.\\
54 - President Siebert, would you like to start?\\
55 -  (clears throat) This is all my fault.\\
56 - I assumed you knew the Nobel Prize was good and we wanted to win it, so that's on me.\\
57 - - Oh, so...\\
58 - - No.\\
59 - I think what President Siebert is trying to say is that this is a setback and we should adopt a different strategy.\\
60 - Like maybe you two keep your traps shut.\\
61 - "Traps." That's a fun old word.\\
62 - Where's that been?\\
63 - I-I'm sorry.\\
64 - I-I just-- I-I snapped.\\
65 - Oh, you're sorry!\\
66 - It's all better then!\\
67 - Listen up, you have a shot to win a Nobel Prize, and you're blowing it.\\
68 - I think what President Siebert is trying to say is that you have a shot to win a Nobel Prize and you're blowing it.\\
69 - Uh, that's exactly what he said.\\
70 - Yes, but I said it in my calming H.R.\\
71 - voice.\\
72 - The science world is a small community.\\
73 - People talk.\\
74 - I'm sure by now everyone knows about your tantrum.\\
75 - - All right, well, what can we do?\\
76 - - Nothing.\\
77 - Let me make this absolutely clear for you.\\
78 - You two are done talking.\\
79 - We're canceling your speaking engagements and your interviews.\\
80 - You're gonna lie low and let us do damage control.\\
81 - Well, if that's what you want, that's what we'll do.\\
82 - You two winning the Nobel Prize is very important to us, and not just to the university.\\
83 - Dr. Fowler, you would be only the fourth woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics.\\
84 - I don't need to tell you just how inspirational that would be to a generation of young women.\\
85 - Uh, yes, of-of course, I know.\\
86 - So, the next words out of your mouth should be on a stage in Stockholm when you're saying...\\
87 -  (speaks Swedish)  \\
88 - ...which is Swedish for, "Thank you for this honor."   \\
89 -  (speaks Swedish)  \\
90 - ...which is Swedish for, "I knew that."    \\
91 - Dr. Cooper...\\
92 - - You want me to shut my trap?\\
93 - - I do.\\
94 - Hey, check it out.\\
95 - That looks like the moped you used to have.\\
96 - It wasn't a moped.\\
97 - It was a scooter.\\
98 - How's that better?\\
99 -  (scoffs)  You do not want to walk into a scooter bar and ask that question.\\
100 - Well, does take me back.\\
101 - Yeah, the two of us, cruising around town looking for women.\\
102 - Looking and looking and looking.\\
103 - Remember that time one looked back and said hi?\\
104 - Oh, yeah.\\
105 - We drove away so fast.\\
106 - Hey, I forget, why did you sell the scooter?\\
107 - I finally got my woman.\\
108 -  (chuckles)  \\
109 - Then my woman made me sell it.\\
110 - So apparently, if we win, I'll be the fourth woman ever to win a Nobel in physics.\\
111 - Wow, that's a big deal.\\
112 - Yeah, tell me about it.\\
113 - This morning,     I blew through my antiperspirant in, like, an hour.\\
114 - Plus, Sheldon's freaking out 'cause we got in trouble.\\
115 - Well, I've got him distracted for a while.\\
116 - Doesn't he know how to solve those?\\
117 - Normally, yes, but I switched the stickers around, so...\\
118 - I don't even think it's possible to solve...\\
119 - Solved it.\\
120 - What?\\
121 - No, you didn't.\\
122 - Not the cube, but the puzzle of why I couldn't solve the cube.\\
123 - Solution: you switched stickers two, nine,   , and   .\\
124 - Really?\\
125 - This thing has numbers?\\
126 - Anything has a number if you assign it a number, friend number four.\\
127 - Top five, not bad.\\
128 - This is so frustrating.\\
129 - I can't believe the university expects us to just sit back and do nothing.\\
130 - Sweetie, you just need to relax.\\
131 - You know what I like to do?\\
132 - Numb your brain with alcohol and watch a reality show where wealthy people pick fake arguments with each other?\\
133 - Hey, don't knock it until you've wasted a couple hundred hours of your life.\\
134 - I'm sorry, but this is, it's hard for me.\\
135 - Usually I self-soothe by doing science, but now science reminds me of the Nobel Prize and the idea that we may not win one, and that makes me angry, which makes me want to self-soothe by doing science, and on and on and on.\\
136 - So that's been my today.\\
137 - Hey, how about a massage?\\
138 - No, the only person who touches me is my wife.\\
139 - And even I have to let him smell my hand first.\\
140 - Okay, well, what about Reiki?\\
141 - It's like massage but without touching.\\
142 - Then what is it?\\
143 - Well, I place my hands near your body and allow the universal energy field to manifest its healing powers.\\
144 - Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but it really works; ask Leonard.\\
145 - -  (stammers)  It really does.\\
146 - - Yeah.\\
147 -  (mouthing) : No.\\
148 - Oh, uh, how about a sensory deprivation tank?\\
149 - Oh, that's interesting.\\
150 - It's supposed to be very calming.\\
151 - Floating in a warm pool of liquid in a dark, soundless space.\\
152 - Oh, I don't know how I feel about being deprived of all my senses.\\
153 - What are you talking about?\\
154 - All you ever do is complain about how things smell, feel and sound.\\
155 - Oh, I'm right here.\\
156 - Why are you shouting?\\
157 - What do you say?\\
158 - We could both use a break.\\
159 - Come on, I'll do it with you.\\
160 - Okay, but not in the same tank.\\
161 - I already shared a uterus with my twin sister.\\
162 - I don't need to go through that again.\\
163 - - Are your eyes closed?\\
164 - - Yes.\\
165 - What is it?\\
166 - Show me.\\
167 - Okay, open them.\\
168 - You bought me a scooter?!\\
169 - No, I bought me a scooter!\\
170 - Then why did you make me close my eyes?\\
171 - I wanted to see the expression on your face when you saw how happy I was.\\
172 - Wait, one second.\\
173 - Won't Bernadette be mad when she finds out?\\
174 - She's not gonna.\\
175 - I'm keeping it here at the university.\\
176 - Ah.\\
177 - My dad kept a secret at work, too, but it was his receptionist.\\
178 - Hey, would you mind if I ride it sometimes?\\
179 - Yeah, whenever you want.\\
180 -  (engine starts)  \\
181 -  (exhales)  Check it out.\\
182 -  (engine revving)  \\
183 -  (chuckles)  That there, son, is horses of "eye-talian" thunder.\\
184 -  (engine revving)  \\
185 - Have either of you done sensory deprivation before?\\
186 - - No.\\
187 - - Never.\\
188 - Okay, just a heads up.\\
189 - People have different experiences in the tanks.\\
190 - Uh, some people experience perfect calm.\\
191 - Some people sleep.\\
192 - Some people even reported having visions.\\
193 - But if at any time you feel uncomfortable, just press the panic button and say, "Bebe."    \\
194 -  (laughs)  That's a stupid word.\\
195 - That's my name.\\
196 - What do we push if we feel uncomfortable?\\
197 - All right, are you ready?\\
198 - I'm not saying this is why we came, but can I close the lid on him?\\
199 - No.\\
200 - No.\\
201 - Shall we?\\
202 -  (stammers)  One second.\\
203 - - Is the pH between  .  and  . ?\\
204 - - Yes.\\
205 - Is the water drained and replaced after each use?\\
206 - Yes.\\
207 - - Is the saline level   %?\\
208 - - Yes.\\
209 - Does your filtration system use ultraviolet light     \\
210 - - to kill bacteria?\\
211 - - Yes.\\
212 - I don't need to get in.\\
213 - I'm relaxed already.\\
214 - Bebe.\\
215 - What's wrong?\\
216 - Nothing.\\
217 - I just wanted to make sure it worked.\\
218 - Also, I changed my mind.\\
219 - It's fun to say your name.\\
220 - Bebe.\\
221 - Bebe.\\
222 - Bebe.\\
223 - Bebe.\\
224 - Bebe.\\
225 - Bebe.\\
226 -  BERNADETTE:  Hey, what you got there?\\
227 - Oh.\\
228 -  (stammers)  Just tossing out this old helmet I don't need.\\
229 - I thought you were at the park.\\
230 - We were.\\
231 - The kids got sleepy.\\
232 - Great story.\\
233 - I need to make a phone call.\\
234 - Howard, why do you look all guilty?\\
235 - Like when I catch you deleting your browser history?\\
236 -  (horn honking) \\
237 - Never mind.\\
238 -  SHELDON:  Hmm, this is nice. \\
239 - It's sort of like floating in space. \\
240 - But better because my eyeballs haven't frozen. \\
241 - Ooh, colors.\\
242 -  (relaxing classical music playing)  \\
243 -  (gasps) \\
244 - It's infinite iterations \\
245 - of the "Nautilus" section of the Mandelbrot set. \\
246 -  (sighs)  \\
247 - That's some good stuff. \\
248 -  (music stops)  \\
249 -  AMY:  Wow, this is really dark. \\
250 - There's no difference between my eyes being open or closed. \\
251 - Open, closed. \\
252 - Open, clo-- nope, same thing. \\
253 - Ooh, pretty. \\
254 - You winning a Nobel Prize would be an inspiration to all women.\\
255 - All women, Amy, and you're blowing it.\\
256 - I was gonna be a scientist, but since you lost, I'm just gonna give makeup tutorials on YouTube.\\
257 -  (relaxing classical music playing)
\subsection {Episode 20: The Decision Reverberation}
1 - Oh, the... there's a  :   at the ArcLight.\\
2 - Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat.\\
3 - We can eat afterwards.\\
4 - I'm not gonna eat at   :   at night.\\
5 - Who am I, Hemingway?\\
6 - Why do you think Hemingway ate at   :  ?\\
7 - He spent a lot of time in Spain.\\
8 - They eat dinner late.\\
9 - He also spent a lot of time in Florida.\\
10 - Last time I was there, people were eating dinner    at, like,  :  .\\
11 - KOOTHRAPPALI: You guys know    that Hemingway had cats with six toes?\\
12 - Six toes per foot or six toes total?\\
13 - WOLOWITZ: Okay.\\
14 - It's official.\\
15 - We're never going to see the Avengers. Guys, just come on.\\
16 - Make a decision.\\
17 - I-I'm good with eating after.\\
18 - - Mm, I'm kind of hungry now.\\
19 - - Yeah, me, too.\\
20 - - Then we'll eat before.\\
21 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Okay.\\
22 - So, then, we can see the  -D at  :   or the  -D at  :  .\\
23 - -D.\\
24 - If I'm gonna see Thor,    I want to feel like I could lick those abs.\\
25 - Actually,  -D kind of makes me queasy.\\
26 - No, but we have to see it in  -D.\\
27 - We saw part one in  -D, and the  -D part two    is not the part two of the  -D part one.\\
28 - He's got you there, Leonard.\\
29 - Or he doesn't.\\
30 - I don't really care anymore.\\
31 - (laughs)\\
32 - LEONARD: Okay, then, we'll go see it in  -D.\\
33 - PENNY: No.\\
34 - Sweetie, you shouldn't do things that make you feel bad.\\
35 - Well, I'm doing this.\\
36 - And of course he is.\\
37 - He is a textbook satisficer.\\
38 - That's not even a word.\\
39 - Uh, yes, it is.\\
40 - According to Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon, satisficing is a decision-making strategy whereby a person accepts whatever available option is satisfactory rather than seeking out a course of action that would make him happiest, as I just did when I explained what satisficing was.\\
41 - KOOTHRAPPALI: He's right.\\
42 - No one wanted to hear at.\\
43 - He knew it, yet he plowed ahead.\\
44 - I'm just trying to find a plan that makes everyone happy.\\
45 - Except you.\\
46 - Yeah, Leonard.\\
47 - What would make you happy?\\
48 - I could tell you about satisficing again.\\
49 - You know, what would make me happy is if we just stop talking about this and see whatever movie you guys want to see whenever you want to see it.\\
50 - Okay.\\
51 - But next time, we get to pick.\\
52 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state   \\
53 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!  \\
54 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
55 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools  \\
56 -  We built the Wall   We built the pyramids  \\
57 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery  \\
58 -  That all started with a big bang   \\
59 -  Bang!     \\
60 - How's your headache?\\
61 - It's better.\\
62 - The throwing up really helped.\\
63 - Mm.\\
64 - I'm so sorry you missed the end of the movie.\\
65 - Oh, it's okay.\\
66 - Everyone talked about it so much on the ride home, I feel like I saw it.\\
67 - Well, to be fair, you talked about the bathroom so much, we felt like we saw that, too.\\
68 - I think I would've been okay if we weren't sitting so close.\\
69 - Well, then, why did we sit so close?\\
70 - Sheldon said, "Are these seats good for everyone?" What was I supposed to do, say no, like a maniac?\\
71 - - (scoffs)\\
72 - Sweetie, you have got to stand up for yourself.\\
73 - You know, maybe Sheldon's right.\\
74 - Maybe you are that word he said.\\
75 - Satisficer?\\
76 - Yeah, that!\\
77 - That's the one.\\
78 - Boy, sounds way more made-up when you say it.\\
79 - I mean, come on, when was the last time you did something totally selfish without worrying about what anyone else wanted?\\
80 - Uh...\\
81 - according to my mother, I took my sweet time being born.\\
82 - How is that selfish?\\
83 - Apparently, she had dinner reservations.\\
84 - And this is the telescope room where I spend a lot of my evenings.\\
85 - Where's the telescope?\\
86 - Hawaii.\\
87 - That's cool.\\
88 - Yeah, so, you know...\\
89 - aloha.\\
90 - What's that smell?\\
91 - Uh, everyone has their own theory.\\
92 - Dr.\\
93 - Tibourgh thinks it's mold.\\
94 - I think it's Dr.\\
95 - Tibourgh.\\
96 - So, what am I looking at?\\
97 - Ah, this is live information from the Keck telescope.\\
98 - It's pretty interesting.\\
99 - So, I recently observed some optical flashes.\\
100 - It could be light bouncing off a natural object, but those tend to be less reflective, so could be evidence of something alien-made.\\
101 - Oh, this suddenly got exciting.\\
102 - Oh.\\
103 - When you say "exciting," do you mean "go back to my place" exciting or "hold our breath and do it here"?\\
104 - Mahalo.\\
105 - Do I want to ask?\\
106 - Oh, w... when I go upstairs, Penny's gonna make me choose what we're gonna do tonight without taking her feelings into consideration, and I-I don't know if I'm up for it.\\
107 - Poor baby.\\
108 - When I go upstairs, Sheldon's gonna give me a   -minute lecture about what Hulk would be like if he were made of metal.\\
109 - Part of his ongoing series, "What If Hulk Were Made of Other Things?" I-I've always been a people pleaser.\\
110 - Is that so bad?\\
111 - It's gotten me this far.\\
112 - What, almost up four flights of stairs?\\
113 - Okay, if I go in there and pick something I want to do that she also wants to do, she's gonna think I'm just picking it to make her happy.\\
114 - So I feel like I have to pick something I know she doesn't want to do or she's gonna be disappointed.\\
115 - Right?\\
116 - What do you think?\\
117 - Think I've got ice cream in this bag that's starting to melt.\\
118 - I'm sorry.\\
119 - It's exhausting being in my head.\\
120 - Look, when you wanted Penny, you didn't care what anybody else thought or wanted, including Penny.\\
121 - That's true.\\
122 - Yeah, yeah, there was something I wanted, I went after it and I got it.\\
123 - Now you're hiding from it on the stairs, so it all worked out.\\
124 - (door opens)\\
125 - LEONARD: Hey.\\
126 - I thought about what I want to do tonight, and I didn't take your feelings into consideration at all.\\
127 - Great.\\
128 - I want to have s*x.\\
129 - Wow, s*x with your wife.\\
130 - You're really swinging for the fences there, Hofstadter.\\
131 - Yeah, we don't have to.\\
132 - No!\\
133 - I like it.\\
134 - Let's go.\\
135 - Oh, o-okay.\\
136 - And then after that, we're gonna watch Star Trek: Discovery. - All right.\\
137 - Well, just a warning, I might be on my phone for most of it.\\
138 - That's fine.\\
139 - Wait, you mean just the Star Trek... Actually, I don't care.\\
140 - And, with apologies to Lady Gaga, that's how a star is born.\\
141 - Told you he was gonna mention Lady Gaga.\\
142 - At least he didn't talk about how much he cried during that movie.\\
143 - KOOTHRAPPALI: Although, if you haven't seen that movie, you should.\\
144 - I cried so much.\\
145 - Well, that's the lecture for today.\\
146 - Uh, let's open it up for questions.\\
147 - Uh...\\
148 - Oh, you!\\
149 - Sir, yes.\\
150 - You have a question?\\
151 - Yeah.\\
152 - Actually, I have a two-part question.\\
153 - Are you sure?\\
154 - I get the sense it's only one part.\\
155 - No, no, it's two.\\
156 - Part one: the new star you were talking about-- how long did it take that light to reach Earth?\\
157 - And part two:     is it true you plant your friends in the audience to ask questions?\\
158 - ,    years.\\
159 - And no, I don't plant my friends, because apparently, I don't have any.\\
160 - Uh, any other questions?\\
161 - - Uh, yes.\\
162 - You, miss.\\
163 - WOMAN: Hi.\\
164 - I read your paper on specular reflections.\\
165 - It was great.\\
166 - - Oh, thank you so much.\\
167 - - In your conclusion, you said you couldn't rule out that light flashes could be evidence of alien civilization.\\
168 - So does that mean you think it's aliens?\\
169 - I was just illustrating that there are many unknowns, and as scientists, we can't preemptively rule out possibilities.\\
170 - So you think it's aliens.\\
171 - - A-Actually, no, that's...\\
172 - WOLOWITZ: I have a question about the aliens you found.\\
173 - That's not what I said, Howard.\\
174 - Hold on a second.\\
175 - Do you two know each other?\\
176 - MAN: Yeah.\\
177 - My sister was-- a-and this is her term-- abducted.\\
178 - Do you think those could be the same aliens...\\
179 - Okay, any other questions?\\
180 - Mm.\\
181 - Not about aliens?\\
182 - What?\\
183 - Do you still want me to ask the one you gave me?\\
184 - 'Cause it kind of feels like we're past that.\\
185 - Ooh, Leonard, I don't mean to alarm you, but the Chinese food smells funny.\\
186 - That's because it's barbecue.\\
187 - But it's Chinese food night.\\
188 - Um, I picked it.\\
189 - You're the one who told me to stop being such a satisficer all the time.\\
190 - What?\\
191 - I did not.\\
192 - I just pointed out that you were one.\\
193 - It's what I like best about you.\\
194 - Well, that and those little notes you leave in my lunch.\\
195 - I leave those!\\
196 - Well, that's disappointing.\\
197 - I already know that you heart me.\\
198 - Now I don't know if Leonard does.\\
199 - Well, this is what we're having for dinner.\\
200 - You can eat it or not.\\
201 - I don't care.\\
202 - I guess that answers the heart question.\\
203 - I-It's fine.\\
204 - We'll have barbecue.\\
205 - Oh, of course.\\
206 - I'm nothing if not flexible.\\
207 - I'm sure that at some point in the  ,   -year history of the Chinese empire, a cavalryman crossing the Gobi Desert was forced by hunger to eat his own horse and roast it over a campfire, hence, Chinese barbecue.\\
208 - Let's eat.\\
209 - Gee, I'm sorry, I didn't watch the news today.\\
210 - Has the whole world gone mad?\\
211 - It's my house.\\
212 - I'm tired of being told where I can and can't sit.\\
213 - You did this.\\
214 - Amy, grab your meat.\\
215 - We're leaving in a huff.\\
216 - I'm sorry, if I don't go now, it's not a huff.\\
217 - Don't take this the wrong way, but that was even more exciting than the s*x.\\
218 - Don't take this the wrong way, but yes, it was.\\
219 - Leonard, where are you going?\\
220 - Well, to work.\\
221 - Just trying out a different route.\\
222 - Okay.\\
223 - If we cross the county line, it's technically kidnapping.\\
224 - Well, if you don't approve of my driving, too bad.\\
225 - This is the new me.\\
226 - Get used to it.\\
227 - Fine.\\
228 - Then this is the new me, and he finds the new you tiresome.\\
229 - How is that different than the old you?\\
230 - The new me gives knowing winks.\\
231 - Well, all these years, I-I was afraid to say what I wanted.\\
232 - You know, even at work, you know, there's things I want to accomplish, but I didn't want to ruffle any feathers or step on any toes.\\
233 - Feathers and toes?\\
234 - Is the new thing you're trying to accomplish ballroom dancing with a chicken?\\
235 - Look at that-- the new me is hilarious.\\
236 - Always wanted to be the principal investigator on a plasma physics study.\\
237 - Hey, look at that-- the new you's funny, too.\\
238 - I'm serious.\\
239 - You know...\\
240 - I'm gonna put together a proposal and tell President Siebert this is what I want to do.\\
241 - If he doesn't let me, there's plenty of other universities that will.\\
242 - Sure there are.\\
243 - Of course you don't want me to do that, because you like it when you're successful and I'm not.\\
244 - No, you're confusing causation and...\\
245 - "Welcome to Alhambra." Where the heck are we?\\
246 - Now I'm some sort of big joke.\\
247 - I'm even on some alien conspiracy blog.\\
248 - See?\\
249 - "Caltech astrophysicist finds proof of alien life'' Wow, that is not a great picture of you.\\
250 - That's not the point.\\
251 - Dr. Koothrappali.\\
252 - I'm surprised to see you in here.\\
253 - Why is that?\\
254 - Because the truth...\\
255 - is out there!\\
256 - (laughing)\\
257 - You see?\\
258 - That's what I'm talking about.\\
259 - People have been doing that to me all day.\\
260 - Relax.\\
261 - They're just having fun.\\
262 - (Koothrappali sighs)\\
263 - Oh, come on!\\
264 - See?\\
265 - It's fun.\\
266 - (chuckles)\\
267 - Wow.\\
268 - Déjà vu.\\
269 - Amy, you're a neuroscientist-- you know the latest research into déjà vu suggests it's nothing but the frontal regions of the brain attempting to correct an inaccurate memory.\\
270 - You telling me stuff I already know is definitely déjà vu.\\
271 - How about telling me something I don't know, like why you're sitting on the stairs.\\
272 - How can I tell if I'm doing something for a noble reason     or a selfish reason?\\
273 - Try saying the thing in your head and see if you can add the words, "That'll show 'em." Leonard's about to demand a job that I don't think the university will give him.\\
274 - I'm worried he's making a giant mistake.\\
275 - But maybe I only think that because deep down I don't want him to succeed.\\
276 - The fact that you're worried about your motivation supports the idea that you genuinely care for your friend.\\
277 - I do.\\
278 - Thank you, Amy.\\
279 - You know what?\\
280 - After I've talked to Leonard, you've earned yourself a bonus lecture on Sponge Hulk.\\
281 - That'll show me.\\
282 - So, I spent the whole day putting together this proposal, and tomorrow I'm gonna tell President Siebert that this is what I want to do.\\
283 - Oh.\\
284 - Well, this...\\
285 - looks great.\\
286 - - You didn't even open it.\\
287 - - Well, no, it's got a nice, you know, science-y heft to it.\\
288 - I...\\
289 - Really proud of you, sweetie.\\
290 - Leonard?\\
291 - - Hmm?\\
292 - - Um,     I have been agonizing over whether or not to say something to you.\\
293 - Aw.\\
294 - Let me help.\\
295 - Don't.\\
296 - I have to.\\
297 - I don't think that you should demand to be in charge of a plasma project.\\
298 - Well, big surprise.\\
299 - You can't stand the idea of me succeeding.\\
300 - No.\\
301 - I'll be honest.\\
302 - New assertive Leonard is going to take some getting used to.\\
303 - But so did cargo pants Leonard, hmm?\\
304 - Who, for the record, I miss.\\
305 - He always had gum.\\
306 - Sheldon, if this is what he wants, he should ask for it.\\
307 - I mean, what's the worst that happens?\\
308 - They say no.\\
309 - Well, I'm not gonna let them say no.\\
310 - If they don't want me to quit, this is what it's gonna take.\\
311 - Wait, you're gonna quit?\\
312 - Yeah.\\
313 - It's like you said, I have to go after what I want, and if I can't get that at Caltech, there are plenty of other universities in the world.\\
314 - W...\\
315 - In the world?\\
316 - (laughs)\\
317 - I can't even get you to go to the beach, and now you want to move to the world?\\
318 - Well, I don't want to, but if that's what I have to do...\\
319 - Okay, don't you think threatening to quit your job is something you should run by me first?\\
320 - You said I shouldn't worry about your feelings.\\
321 - I meant feelings about things that I don't care about!\\
322 - Now, I'm not quite sure when to jump in here...\\
323 - - Not now.\\
324 - - Okay.\\
325 - Fine, you want to talk about it?\\
326 - Let's talk about it.\\
327 - I-I'm not loving my job right now.\\
328 - And this is something that would make me happy.\\
329 - Don't you want me to be happy?\\
330 - Oh, I've been dinged on this before.\\
331 - Whatever you really think, you have to say yes.\\
332 - - Of course I want you to be happy.\\
333 - - Well played.\\
334 - Okay, I know this seems scary, but I put together a strong proposal.\\
335 - It's good for me, it's good for the university.\\
336 - They're gonna give it to me.\\
337 - No.\\
338 - I'm sorry, President Siebert, but I'm not taking no for an answer.\\
339 - I speak a little Russian.\\
340 - Will you take nyet for an answer?\\
341 - I'm serious.\\
342 - Oh.\\
343 - Well, that changes everything.\\
344 - - Really?\\
345 - - Nyet. I know a lot of people have been having fun claiming that I said I found alien life.\\
346 - (chuckles)\\
347 - I want to make it clear that is not what I said.\\
348 - I did say that was one possible explanation.\\
349 - I don't think that's something to mock.\\
350 - Right?\\
351 - It would be arrogant for us to assume that we are alone in the universe.\\
352 - And as scientists, we need to remain open to the possibility that the truth may sound silly or far-fetched.\\
353 - Uh, the round Earth.\\
354 - Germs that cause diseases.\\
355 - Subatomic particles.\\
356 - All these at one time seemed fanciful.\\
357 - So who's to say what science fiction of today will be the reality of tomorrow?\\
358 - Will there be colonies on Mars?\\
359 - Uh, matter transporters?\\
360 - Perhaps the Loch Ness Monster is real.\\
361 - Who knows?\\
362 - I'm just saying that...\\
363 - the only way science moves forward is to follow the evidence wherever it leads, even if it makes us sound crazy sometimes.\\
364 - Hey, Bernie, look at this.\\
365 - "Caltech astrophysicist claims Loch Ness Monster is real." (giggles)\\
366 - - Hey.\\
367 - How did it go?\\
368 - - Great.\\
369 - What, so you got the job?\\
370 - I did not.\\
371 - So you quit?\\
372 - Okay, Leonard, I can't move.\\
373 - I just bought a six-month membership to SoulCycle.\\
374 - Well, I-I didn't quit.\\
375 - I said I was going to.\\
376 - I walked out the door and started crying.\\
377 - You know, "Oh, my, God, oh, my God, oh, my God, what'd I do?" And then he called me back in.\\
378 - (gasps)\\
379 - Then he changed his mind?\\
380 - He did not.\\
381 - I'm really confused about how to react to this story.\\
382 - President Siebert didn't want to lose me.\\
383 - Even though they couldn't make me a lead investigator on a plasma team, there was an opening for a co-lead on a photon entanglement team.\\
384 - How cool is that?\\
385 - You're gonna have to tell me.\\
386 - It's really cool.\\
387 - Yay!\\
388 - Oh, I am so happy for you.\\
389 - I almost got what I wanted, and it never would have happened if you hadn't almost believed in me.\\
390 - - Oh.\\
391 - Let's celebrate.\\
392 - What do you want to do?\\
393 - Oh, please don't make me decide another thing.\\
394 - (sighs)\\
395 - Hey, you want to go to SoulCycle with me?\\
396 - Give me a minute, I'll think of something.\\
397 - Now, I know what You're you're thinking: isn't Broccoli Hulk basically just the Jolly Green Giant?\\
398 - That is what I was thinking.\\
399 - Let's never discuss it again.\\
400 - Really?\\
401 - - Are you hiding from Penny again?\\
402 - - No.\\
403 - No, no, no.\\
404 - I-I went to SoulCycle with her, and my legs hurt so bad, I...\\
405 - literally can't stand up.\\
406 - Sheldon, why don't you keep him company.\\
407 - All right.\\
408 - Hello, Leonard.\\
409 - Hey.\\
410 - (sighs)\\
411 - Have you ever wondered what the Hulk would be like if he were made of sherbet?\\
412 - I give up.\\
413 - Delicious.
\subsection {Episode 21: The Plagiarism Schism}
1 - Previously on The Big Bang Theory...  \\
2 - We conclusively proved super-asymmetry, and yet somehow we-we still feel like imposters.  \\
3 - Yeah, there should be a term for that.  \\
4 - Oh, for crying out loud, there is a term for that!  \\
5 - It's called "imposter syndrome," and you don't have it, because you can't have it if you are imposters, and you are!  \\
6 - We're the ones who discovered super-asymmetry, so if anyone's gonna feel like they have imposter syndrome, it's us because we're not imposters, they are!   \\
7 - You're imposters and you're frauds!   \\
8 - I think what President Siebert is trying to say is that this is a setback and we should adopt a different strategy.   \\
9 - I-I'm sorry. I-I just-- I-I snapped.   \\
10 - Oh, you're sorry.\\
11 - It's all better, then.   \\
12 - Listen up, you have shot to win a Nobel Prize, and you're blowing it.   \\
13 - I think what President Siebert is trying to say is that you have a shot to win a Nobel Prize, and you're blowing it.   \\
14 - Uh, that's exactly what he said.   \\
15 - Yes, but I said it in my calming HR voice.   \\
16 - So, obviously, I'm really sorry about my outburst.   \\
17 - (stammers) Calling you frauds was unacceptable.   \\
18 - I feel terrible about it.   \\
19 - It has caused her a lot of stress.   \\
20 - She chewed through her night guard like it was a piece of jerky.   \\
21 - What you said was really hurtful, especially because I thought we were friends.   \\
22 - Why would you think that?   \\
23 - Ouch.   \\
24 - Ignore them; they're just mean people.   \\
25 - Uh, not mean, just sorry.   \\
26 - Seem mean, are sorry. Happens all the time.   \\
27 - It's okay.\\
28 - I talked to my therapist, and she made me realize that what you said was really more about your own insecurities.   \\
29 - I'm sorry, what?   \\
30 - There you go, she's sorry.\\
31 - We all heard it. Moving on.   \\
32 - Yes, obviously, you're angry at all the attention we're getting for our discovery and you're lashing out.   \\
33 - Well, uh, technically, she lashed out.   \\
34 - I contained myself, which I don't think I'm getting enough credit for.   \\
35 - The point is we should take it as a compliment that even you guys think we will win the Nobel Prize.   \\
36 - Uh, no, we-we certainly do not think that.   \\
37 - The Nobel Committee will realize that we came up with this theory.   \\
38 - But we proved it.   \\
39 - By accident.   \\
40 - All breakthroughs happen by accident.   \\
41 - No, they don't!   \\
42 - Look, the Nobel Committee doesn't like infighting, so if the four of you don't stop sniping at each other, the award's gonna go to someone else entirely.   \\
43 - He's right.   \\
44 - You know, like it or not, we can't avoid each other.   \\
45 - Let's at least try to be civil.   \\
46 - Agreed.   \\
47 - You know, when you think about it, we're linked together the same way that super-asymmetry links together every atom in the universe.   \\
48 - Hmm.   \\
49 - That's not what it does at all!   \\
50 - Well, that's the great thing about science.   \\
51 - We all get to have our own opinions.   \\
52 - I'm still not talking.\\
53 - That's impressive, right?   \\
54 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
55 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
56 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
57 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
58 -  We built the Wall \\
59 -  We built the pyramids    \\
60 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
61 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
62 -  Bang!    \\
63 - You-- No, no, no, no.\\
64 - Your money's no good here.   \\
65 - Well, I'm glad that we hashed all that out, and moving forward, may the best team win.   \\
66 - I couldn't agree more.   \\
67 - (quietly):\\
68 - We're the best team.   \\
69 - Greg Pemberton, you old so-and-so.   \\
70 - (chuckles) Very good to see you.   \\
71 - Uh, let me introduce you to my colleague, Dr. Campbell.   \\
72 - Uh, Kevin, this is Barry Kripke.\\
73 - We went to college together.   \\
74 - Great to meet you.\\
75 - Well, you have my number.   \\
76 - We should hit up the buffet at the strip club while you're in town.   \\
77 - Nothing beats a lap dance and a baked potato bar, huh?   \\
78 - (chuckles)   \\
79 - You can come, too.   \\
80 - That's a hard pass.   \\
81 - I'll walk you out.    \\
82 - PEMBERTON: Good to see you, Barry.    \\
83 - You're the best!    \\
84 - Oh...    \\
85 - God, I hate that guy.    \\
86 - That's strange; you seem quite fond of him.    \\
87 - I was only being polite. Pemberton is a grade A weasel.    \\
88 - How do I know you're not just being polite when you say it's nice to see me?    \\
89 - I have literally never said that to you.    \\
90 - Why do you say he's a weasel?    \\
91 - (sighs) Pemberton's whole M.O. was to take other people's ideas and turn them in as his own.    \\
92 - That's exactly what he's doing to us.    \\
93 - I'm not surprised. I heard the only work he did on his thesis was googling, "Where can I buy a thesis?"    \\
94 - Well, plagiarism is a pretty serious charge. Are you sure?    \\
95 - You want proof? I can make some calls.    \\
96 - You'd do that for us?    \\
97 - I really don't want to see that guy win a Nobel.    \\
98 - I also don't want to see you win a Nobel.    \\
99 - Ooh, this is tricky.    \\
100 - I don't know, Barry.\\
101 - It sounds a little sleazy.    \\
102 - Well, let me know if you change your mind.    \\
103 - Sleazy is where I thrive.    \\
104 - So I was talking to my mom about our Pemberton and Campbell situation.    \\
105 - Really? What'd she say?    \\
106 - Apparently, Old Testament God would bring down his wrath on them for being deceitful, but New Testament God would forgive them.    \\
107 - So couldn't we just bring down our wrath and ask the New Testament God to forgive us?    \\
108 - You know, I asked her that very question.    \\
109 - And?    \\
110 - She said I was full of California sass.    \\
111 - Oh, good, you're all here. Uh, we're wrestling with an ethical question, and perhaps you could help.    \\
112 - - Sure, what's up? - Yeah.\\
113 - - Fire away.    \\
114 - If we have damaging and embarrassing information about someone, should we keep it to ourselves or expose them?    \\
115 - Quick question: Does it happen to do with online tastes that might or might not reflect their real-life tastes?    \\
116 - I know all about your tall girl website.    \\
117 - It goes on our credit card.    \\
118 - It's Dr. Pemberton.    \\
119 - Kripke says he plagiarized his thesis, and that he can prove it.    \\
120 - Wow. Well, that's not gonna sit well with the Nobel Committee.    \\
121 - Hang on. I don't think it's fair to use something someone did in school against them.    \\
122 - Relax, he said it's not you.    \\
123 - I don't know. If someone's a cheater, they should be held accountable no matter how long ago it was.    \\
124 - (laughs): Okay, now you just sound crazy.    \\
125 - So you really think they should do this?    \\
126 - (stammers) It wouldn't just knock Pemberton out of Nobel contention, it would blow up his whole career.    \\
127 - To that, I say kaboom!    \\
128 - No, I meant it's a bad thing.    \\
129 - No, no, I agree with Bernadette.    \\
130 - If Pemberton cheated, maybe he shouldn't have a career in the first place.    \\
131 - There's plenty of people that didn't plagiarize.    \\
132 - And a few of us who did, but it's only 'cause The Scarlet Letter was so boring.    \\
133 - Aw, I love The Scarlet Letter. \\
134 - Th-That's where I got my taste for bad girls.    \\
135 - Ugh, why is this decision so hard?    \\
136 - Maybe because you want to win, but deep down you know it's not the honorable way to do it.    \\
137 - Otherwise, you would've done it already.    \\
138 - That's really wise.    \\
139 - Yes, but it may just be the Indian accent.    \\
140 - Do you think by not exposing Pemberton we're doing the right thing?    \\
141 - Of course.    \\
142 - Unless you think we're not doing the right thing.    \\
143 - Why would you think that I don't think we're doing the right thing?    \\
144 - You might think that if good people hold themselves to unrealistically high ethical standards, then they might lose out to their unscrupulous competitors.    \\
145 - Is that what you think?    \\
146 - No.    \\
147 - No, I just thought if you thought we weren't doing the right thing, that's why you might think that.    \\
148 - Well, if I did think that, you might point out that people who claim it's okay to do bad things to win are bad people no matter what they tell themselves.    \\
149 - And I'd be right to point that out.    \\
150 - Because you're a good person.    \\
151 - I love talking to you.    \\
152 - It's like talking to me, but with a girl voice.    \\
153 - I'm just saying, Sheldon and Amy deserve to win, and sometimes that means doing what you got to do.    \\
154 - Don't you think it's better to take the high road?    \\
155 - Yeah, and instead of guns, armies should carry candy canes that shoot wishes.    \\
156 - So what's the worst thing you've ever done to get something you wanted?    \\
157 - I'm not gonna tell you that.    \\
158 - Oh, come on.\\
159 - I'll tell you mine.    \\
160 - (laughs): Right, 'cause yours is gonna be as bad as mine. Okay.    \\
161 - (chuckles)\\
162 - Come on, just tell me.    \\
163 - Okay, fine.    \\
164 - When we first met, there was another waitress at The Cheesecake Factory who thought you were cute, so I told her you had all the hepatitises, A through Z.    \\
165 - There aren't    hepatitises.    \\
166 - Well, if she was smart enough to know that, she wouldn't still be working at a Cheesecake Factory.    \\
167 - Oh, she still works there?\\
168 - Who was it?    \\
169 - Why does it matter?    \\
170 - You're right, it doesn't matter 'cause I got the best one.    \\
171 - Was it Susan?    \\
172 - Why? Because she's tall?    \\
173 - Good night.    \\
174 - Can't believe it.    \\
175 - Sheldon loves telling on people when they break the rules.    \\
176 - Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.    \\
177 - He hasn't changed. Last week, when the vending machine gave me two bags of chips, he called my mom.    \\
178 - Well, that didn't ruin your life.    \\
179 - Well, it ruined my day.    \\
180 - I had to talk to my mom, who, by the way, is-is polyamorous now, so that's fun to think about.    \\
181 - Look, I'm proud of Sheldon and Amy.    \\
182 - You know? They want to win this thing on their own merits, not by knocking out the competition.    \\
183 - Yeah, but what if they don't win?    \\
184 - Uh, Pemberton and Campbell have done an amazing job of associating their names with super-asymmetry.    \\
185 - They have all the momentum right now.    \\
186 - I don't like the idea of them losing either, but this is their decision to make, not ours.    \\
187 - (sighs)    \\
188 - Maybe it is ours.    \\
189 - What do you mean?    \\
190 - Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy don't want to expose Pemberton, that doesn't mean someone else can't do it for them.    \\
191 - They'd never have to know.    \\
192 - Really? You'd do that?    \\
193 - They deserve the Nobel.    \\
194 - I'm not gonna let two frauds steal it from them.    \\
195 - And if that means getting my hands dirty, so be it.    \\
196 - (laughs)\\
197 - What's so funny?    \\
198 - Just realized I've never actually seen your hands dirty.    \\
199 - All right, Hofstadter, here's all the proof you need.    \\
200 - - Great, thanks.\\
201 - - Just remember,    \\
202 - once you take this envelope, there's no turning back.    \\
203 - What if I look at it and decide not to use it?    \\
204 - I had not considered that.    \\
205 - Got to hand it to you, you got a real talent for making things boring.    \\
206 - Thanks.    \\
207 - Hey, look at that, you did it again.    \\
208 - Hi, Leonard.    \\
209 - What? Nothing.    \\
210 - You okay?    \\
211 - Uh, no, you are.    \\
212 - So guess what.\\
213 - There was a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory back in the day who kind of had a thing for me.    \\
214 - Other than Bernadette?\\
215 - That does not sound right.    \\
216 - Honest to God.    \\
217 - Oh, well, who was it?    \\
218 - It doesn't even matter.\\
219 - I'm happily married.    \\
220 - The point is women-- plural-- find me appealing.    \\
221 - Okay. Okay, well, well, let's see.    \\
222 - Okay? We-we know it wasn't Penny, we know it wasn't Susan...\\
223 - - Wait.    \\
224 - How do we know it wasn't Susan?    \\
225 - Uh, because she had a type.    \\
226 - What type?    \\
227 - Don't make me say it.    \\
228 - Are you saying I'm not a handsome guy?    \\
229 - See? It's mean, right?    \\
230 - Hold on, as we've established, a minimum of two women think I'm attractive.    \\
231 - Uh, yeah, you're right, it was totally Susan.    \\
232 - I didn't say it was her.\\
233 - I said it could've been.    \\
234 - It could've been anybody. Marta, Gina, Annalise...    \\
235 - It's a little creepy that you remember all their names.    \\
236 - Not just their names.    \\
237 - The cars they drove, the color of their eyes, and whether or not they had boyfriends.    \\
238 - Your husband was acting kind of weird today.    \\
239 - You sure you're not thinking about your husband?    \\
240 - No. He was acting all sketchy.    \\
241 - Almost like he was guilty or something.    \\
242 - Oh. Well, that doesn't mean anything.    \\
243 - I mean, Leonard has resting guilt face.    \\
244 - Yeah, it's-it's like, "What are you guilty about, Leonard?"    \\
245 - "Nothing." "Well, then, tell it to your face." (scoffs)    \\
246 - Are you okay?    \\
247 - I'm so okay, yeah.    \\
248 - Then why are you acting guilty now?    \\
249 - Okay, look, Leonard knows that you and Sheldon decided to take the high road, so he went to Kripke for you.    \\
250 - But that just means you didn't do anything wrong, and now you don't risk losing to those idiots.    \\
251 - Why did you tell me?    \\
252 - Now that I know, I'm implicated.    \\
253 - But you wanted me to.    \\
254 - I also wanted you to be my jester at the Renaissance Fair, but that didn't happen.    \\
255 - I wanted to be a princess.    \\
256 - There was only one princess, and it was me!    \\
257 - Fine. I'm sorry I told you.    \\
258 - And I forgive you.    \\
259 - 'Cause that's what a princess would do.    \\
260 - Kudos on the meatballs.    \\
261 - They're nice and round.    \\
262 - - Thanks.\\
263 - - Yeah.    \\
264 - They're much better than those prolate spheroids you used to pass off as balls.    \\
265 - Okay.    \\
266 - Are you all right?\\
267 - You seem distracted.    \\
268 - Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to figure something out.    \\
269 - Is it what to get me for our anniversary?    \\
270 - 'Cause I'll give you a hint: it's already in my Amazon basket. Just click "buy now."    \\
271 - I filled out the gift card for you.    \\
272 - Apparently, I'm the light of your life.    \\
273 - Sheldon, if someone were gonna do something ethically murky on your behalf, would you rather know about it or not know about it to retain your innocence?    \\
274 - Well, now that I know there's a thing to know, I have to know.    \\
275 - Can't help myself; I'm a fact addict.    \\
276 - That's not a real thing.    \\
277 - And that's a fact.    \\
278 - Leonard, I know what you're planning to do, and I said I didn't want to do it.    \\
279 - What? You told him?    \\
280 - Well, you told me.    \\
281 - Yeah, that's-that's probably where you heard it.    \\
282 - You're not doing anything wrong.    \\
283 - That's the point.\\
284 - I'm doing it.    \\
285 - Yeah, but it's still wrong.    \\
286 - Well, so is you and Amy not getting the recognition for your discovery.    \\
287 - And if that means I have to do something shady so you don't have to, I'm okay with that.    \\
288 - But we're not.    \\
289 - I mean, it's sweet that you want to help, but we don't want you compromising your integrity for us.    \\
290 - Wait, what-- really?    \\
291 - I thought we were just worried about looking bad.    \\
292 - It could be both.    \\
293 - Okay.    \\
294 - But I'm gonna go with my reason.\\
295 - Yours is too complicated.    \\
296 - Hey.    \\
297 - Hey.    \\
298 - Listen, I did something kind of stupid today.    \\
299 - Okay.    \\
300 - I went to The Cheesecake Factory to try to figure out who that waitress was.    \\
301 - - Howie.\\
302 - - Don't worry, I didn't find out, because I realized I didn't even care. (chuckles)    \\
303 - W-While I was there, I started asking myself, "Why does this mean anything to me?"    \\
304 - And... I guess the truth is it was all about my vanity.    \\
305 - And why should I need to be validated by another woman liking me when the best woman in the world already loves me?    \\
306 - (sighs)    \\
307 - And I just wanted you to know that.    \\
308 - (chuckles)    \\
309 - The restaurant manager already called.    \\
310 - You really creeped a lot of people out.    \\
311 - And I regret that.\\
312 - (chuckles)    \\
313 - Because the only woman I want to creep out is the mother of my children.    \\
314 - Well, you're off to a good start.    \\
315 - Thank you for meeting us.    \\
316 - No problem.    \\
317 - We never say no when someone wants to buy us lunch.    \\
318 - We didn't say we were going to buy you lunch.    \\
319 - Really? Apologies go down easier with free turkey club sandwiches.    \\
320 - This isn't another apology.    \\
321 - There's something we have to give you.    \\
322 - Yes.    \\
323 - Uh, we have proof that you plagiarized your thesis.    \\
324 - It's why we invited you to this lunch.    \\
325 - (gasps)\\
326 - We invited them.    \\
327 - That's the confusion over who's paying.    \\
328 - Hold on, are you blackmailing us?    \\
329 - No, the opposite.    \\
330 - We're blackmailing you?    \\
331 - How are you up for a Nobel?!    \\
332 - SHELDON: We're giving you this so that no one can use it against you, because we want to win on our own merits, not by tearing you down.    \\
333 - So it's true?\\
334 - You really did this?    \\
335 - It was years ago, and I was going through a very hard time.\\
336 - - What hard time?    \\
337 - I had to write a thesis, and I wasn't smart enough to do it.    \\
338 - You realize my name is attached to yours.    \\
339 - If this gets out, it ruins me, too.    \\
340 - It's not gonna get out.    \\
341 - (scoffs) You know what? Linda was right.    \\
342 - You're always looking for shortcuts.    \\
343 - When did you talk to my ex-wife?    \\
344 - She's not your ex-wife.    \\
345 - You keep dragging your feet on those papers.    \\
346 - Well, I'm trying to get the lake house.    \\
347 - You're not getting the lake house.    \\
348 - You're never getting the lake house.    \\
349 - She picked it out, she decorated it.    \\
350 - The lake house is hers.    \\
351 - What is going on here?    \\
352 - I'm in love with Linda!    \\
353 - You son of a bitch!    \\
354 - (both grunting)    \\
355 - That was my iced tea.    \\
356 - (slurring): Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler.    \\
357 - Just the guy I want to see.    \\
358 - Are you drunk?    \\
359 - I was, and then I still was.    \\
360 - And now, I still was.    \\
361 - Okay, can we help you?    \\
362 - Pemberton is out.    \\
363 - Someone published all the information about his plagiarism.    \\
364 - (whispers): It was me.    \\
365 - Someone else told Fermilab, and he lost his job.    \\
366 - (whispers): Also me.    \\
367 - And someone is sleeping with his ex-wife and it's not me.    \\
368 - I thought it was.    \\
369 - Not anymore. Apparently, just because I'm better than her husband doesn't mean I'm as good as her contractor.    \\
370 - Women, huh?    \\
371 - I-I think you need to go.    \\
372 - No, wait.\\
373 - Hear me out.    \\
374 - Look, the three of us could team up.    \\
375 - There's one small catch.    \\
376 - Dr. Pemberton has been saying a lot of bad stuff about me.    \\
377 - But don't worry, I couldn't possibly have done any of it, because I was with you guys the whole time.    \\
378 - (whispers): I did it.    \\
379 - (stammers) Frankly, I don't know what Linda ever saw in either of them.
\subsection {Episode 22: The Maternal Conclusion}
1 - Leonard, when are you leaving to pick your mother up from the airport?  \\
2 - Uh, well, let's see, her plane gets in at  :  , figure half hour to get her luggage, so... never.  \\
3 - Never?  \\
4 - Isn't that usually when you go to the gym?  \\
5 - Are you really not gonna pick up your mother?  \\
6 - No-- it's fine, she likes to take a cab or a shuttle.  \\
7 - That way she can meet people.   \\
8 - Well, that's kind of nice.   \\
9 - Yeah, she always says that a stranger is just a person whose emotional weak point you haven't found yet.   \\
10 - Your mom is the best.\\
11 - (chuckles)   \\
12 - Oh, maybe I should pick her up.   \\
13 - You don't drive.   \\
14 - That's what makes you and me a great team.   \\
15 - Go get your keys.   \\
16 - You can't pick her up.   \\
17 - It'll make me look like a bad son.   \\
18 - I imagine that's one of the things we'll talk about on the ride.   \\
19 - That and Amy's recent reluctance to use turn signals.   \\
20 - We were in a parking garage.   \\
21 - Come on, she gave birth to you.   \\
22 - Fine, I'll pick her up.   \\
23 - Good, I'll go with you.   \\
24 - - I call back seat.\\
25 - - Oh, I don't want to be the only one who doesn't go.   \\
26 - I'll just sit here afraid that you're all talking about me.   \\
27 - We're not gonna talk about you.   \\
28 - Well, that's my other fear.   \\
29 - This is crazy. I can pick her up by myself.   \\
30 - So it's just you?   \\
31 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state    \\
32 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!    \\
33 -  The Earth began to cool    \\
34 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools    \\
35 -  We built the Wall \\
36 -  We built the pyramids    \\
37 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery    \\
38 -  That all started with a big bang    \\
39 -  Bang!    \\
40 - How was your flight?   \\
41 - There were some parents with a baby.   \\
42 - A lot of crying.   \\
43 - Well, babies do that.   \\
44 - No, it was the parents.   \\
45 - It seems they couldn't handle some constructive criticism.   \\
46 - Hey, on a completely unrelated note, um,   \\
47 - you know, if you'd rather stay at a hotel,   \\
48 - we wouldn't be offended.   \\
49 - Actually, I've been looking forward to staying with you.   \\
50 - Really? It's just, normally, you stay at a hotel.   \\
51 - Would you like me to stay at a hotel?   \\
52 - No, no, no.   \\
53 - I-I invited you to stay with us.   \\
54 - And I accepted, so everyone is happy.   \\
55 - Yep.   \\
56 - I'm happy, you're happy...   \\
57 - ...everyone's happy.   \\
58 - How come we never eat in the dining room?   \\
59 - Oh, that's for company.   \\
60 - What am I?   \\
61 - Apparently, a guy who wants to have his feelings hurt.   \\
62 - When does Anu come back from London?   \\
63 - Next week.\\
64 - But it's been good, you know?   \\
65 - Really given me a chance to focus on myself.   \\
66 - How's that going?   \\
67 - I didn't like what I saw, got in my car, drove over here.   \\
68 - - Hey, guys.\\
69 - - Hey. - Hey.   \\
70 - I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.   \\
71 - It's all right, neither did they.   \\
72 - Is Stuart home?   \\
73 - No, he's at work.   \\
74 - The last juice.\\
75 - I'm gonna add it to the list.   \\
76 - That's whose handwriting\\
77 - that is.   \\
78 - I've noticed she's been over here a lot lately.   \\
79 - You know how you noticed that?   \\
80 - Because you're over here a lot lately.   \\
81 - She has slept over every night this week.   \\
82 - Uh, no, no, she wasn't here Wednesday night.   \\
83 - Yes, she was. You didn't notice because you were in the hot tub in the backyard eating Oreos.   \\
84 - That reminds me.   \\
85 - Oreos.   \\
86 - Really?   \\
87 - A photon entanglement team.   \\
88 - Yeah, I-I'm actually the colead.   \\
89 - Yeah, if you like photons and how they get entangled, he's your co-guy.\\
90 - (Leonard chuckles)   \\
91 - I would enjoy seeing your lab.   \\
92 - Oh. Yeah, sure.   \\
93 - Uh, if you want, you can come tomorrow.   \\
94 - I look forward to it.   \\
95 - Well, I think I'm going to turn in.   \\
96 - Good night, Penny.    \\
97 - Good night, dear.    \\
98 - - Good night.\\
99 - - Night, Beverly.    \\
100 - Wow, she's being really nice.    \\
101 - Yeah, clearly, one of us is dying.    \\
102 - Come on, her.    \\
103 - Or you accomplished something great, and she's genuinely proud.    \\
104 - Yeah, all right, you've had enough.    \\
105 - (keyboard clicks)\\
106 - Hi.    \\
107 - - Hey.\\
108 - - Oh, it's so good to see your face.    \\
109 - H-How's the concierge conference?    \\
110 - You guys just get theater tickets for each other all day long?    \\
111 - (chuckles)\\
112 - It's going great, and the company put me in a nice place in Notting Hill.    \\
113 - Notting Hill? Like the movie?    \\
114 - Uh, "I'm just a boy standing in front of a girl saying..."    \\
115 - you better bring me home a T-shirt.    \\
116 - I can't wait for you to come home.    \\
117 - Actually, that's one of the reasons I called.    \\
118 - They offered me a management position.    \\
119 - That's amazing.\\
120 - T-That's your dream.    \\
121 - It's here in London.    \\
122 - Oh.    \\
123 - And they want me to start right away.    \\
124 - What does that mean for us?    \\
125 - Well, how committed are you to staying in California?    \\
126 - This is where my work is, this is where my friends are.    \\
127 - But are you happy?    \\
128 - Not for years.\\
129 - What's your point?    \\
130 - All right, I got to head out to my drawing class.    \\
131 - Fruit or naked dudes?    \\
132 - Actually, it doesn't matter, I'm jealous of both.    \\
133 - - I'll see you tonight?\\
134 - - Yeah.    \\
135 - (laughs softly)    \\
136 - So she's coming over again, huh?    \\
137 - Yeah, we're gonna do a movie night.    \\
138 - It's my house. Don't you think you should ask me?    \\
139 - You're right, I'm sorry.    \\
140 - Howard, would you like to come to movie night?    \\
141 - Doesn't she have her own place?    \\
142 - Why don't you guys hang out there?    \\
143 - Oh, she has a roommate, and he's kind of creepy.    \\
144 - A-And that's coming from me.    \\
145 - It just feels like Denise is basically living with us.    \\
146 - You know, maybe you can spend half the time at her place.    \\
147 - Hey, when I moved in, you and Bernadette said it was okay if I brought girls over.    \\
148 - (laughs):\\
149 - Oh. We were making fun of you.    \\
150 - And this is a high-pulse laser with a BBO crystal.    \\
151 - It's pretty cool.    \\
152 - It emits photons in discrete bursts.    \\
153 - Huh. Very impressive.    \\
154 - But...?    \\
155 - But what, dear?    \\
156 - Oh, I don't know.    \\
157 - It's just, usually there's a "but" followed by something that makes me feel bad.    \\
158 - Ah, Beverly, there you are.    \\
159 - Sheldon, how nice to see you.    \\
160 - Leonard was just showing me his new lab.    \\
161 - Oh, yes, experimental physics, the carpentry of the science world. Well...    \\
162 - I'm here to rescue you from the boredom.    \\
163 - Not necessary. This is really quite interesting.    \\
164 - But...?    \\
165 - But nothing.    \\
166 - Oh. Well, if you want to see something really interesting, I could show you my work, which is being talked about for a Nobel Prize.    \\
167 - Oh, well, I'd love to see it later, but right now, I'm spending time with my son.    \\
168 - Ha! I knew there was a "but"-- wait, what?    \\
169 - Ready?    \\
170 - You sure I didn't need to see Paddington  ? \\
171 - He's a bear, he talks, no one knows why.    \\
172 - You're all caught up.    \\
173 - Push play.    \\
174 - May I join you?    \\
175 - Oh. Hey, Mitch, I didn't see you there.    \\
176 - Really? I've been standing here the whole time.    \\
177 - Well, sure. Yeah, join us.    \\
178 - (exhales)    \\
179 - (music playing softly over TV)    \\
180 - Movie's up there.    \\
181 - I've seen it.    \\
182 - It's wonderful.    \\
183 - So she's staying in London?    \\
184 - What does that mean for your relationship?    \\
185 - It's great.    \\
186 - I can see why she would say that, but why do you?    \\
187 - Well, we got into this because we both wanted to get married, and honestly, we've been dragging our feet, and I think this is the push that we need.    \\
188 - Wait, so you're gonna ask her to marry you?    \\
189 - Why not?    \\
190 - We like each other, plus, we both want to start a family.    \\
191 - Hey, I can work from anywhere, I'm an astronomer.    \\
192 - They have stars in London, and I'm not just talking about Dame Judi Dench.    \\
193 - No one thought you were.    \\
194 - I thought he was.    \\
195 - So you're really gonna move halfway across the world?    \\
196 - If she says yes, and if that's what she wants to do, then yeah.    \\
197 - Wow.    \\
198 - Yeah, I know.\\
199 - I'm flying out tomorrow.    \\
200 - I'm gonna surprise her with a ring.    \\
201 - You already have a ring?    \\
202 - Well, it's the same one as before.    \\
203 - I thought you gave it to her the first time you got engaged?    \\
204 - I did, but I took it back.    \\
205 - So, you're an Indian giver?    \\
206 - Howie.    \\
207 - What? If he's gonna move to England,    \\
208 - I need to get all these out now.    \\
209 - Here you go.\\
210 - Light cream, no sugar.    \\
211 - That's perfect, thank you.    \\
212 - Beverly, I have to say, it's so nice seeing the two of you get along.    \\
213 - Oh, I've always gotten along with Leonard.    \\
214 - Of all of my children, he's the most docile.    \\
215 - She wrote that in a birthday card once.    \\
216 - I keep it in my nightstand.\\
217 - (chuckles)    \\
218 - Still, it made him so happy showing you around his lab yesterday.    \\
219 - Interesting.    \\
220 - Would you say that that made him, uh, much happier than usual, somewhat happier than usual or as happy as usual?    \\
221 - Hmm, multiple choice.    \\
222 - Um, I'm-a go with D: "that's a weird question."    \\
223 - It made me really happy.    \\
224 - We haven't always had the easiest relationship.    \\
225 - But, well, looking back,    \\
226 - I guess you were just trying to push me to be the best version of myself.    \\
227 - So you would say that my parenting strategies, although difficult at times, directly contributed to your current success?    \\
228 - Well, I may have had a little something to do with it.    \\
229 - I mean, how often do you wear your superhero underwear now?    \\
230 - - Only Fridays and my birthday.\\
231 - - Yeah, that was all me.    \\
232 - That was me.    \\
233 - Yeah, that's a fair point.    \\
234 - I hadn't considered your influence.    \\
235 - Perhaps tomorrow I could observe the two of you together?    \\
236 - Uh, "observe"?    \\
237 - (laughs)\\
238 - What is going on?    \\
239 - I'm just visiting with my son and doing research for my book on how various parenting strategies affected my children as adults.    \\
240 - This has all been work to you?    \\
241 - Hanging out with me and coming to my lab, I...    \\
242 - I thought we were enjoying each other's company, but it was just research.    \\
243 - I was enjoying it; you know I love research.    \\
244 - I can't believe this.    \\
245 - - What? You seem angry.\\
246 - - Of course I'm angry!    \\
247 - Well, so would you say that you're somewhat angry, very angry or extremely angry?    \\
248 - Never mind.    \\
249 - I can see it in your face, dear.    \\
250 - I'm looking over my text correspondence with Beverly and I don't see anything that would have given her offense.    \\
251 - Nothing's ambiguous,    \\
252 - I spell everything out.    \\
253 - Including "laugh out loud" and "what's the fracas?"    \\
254 - I'm sure she's not mad at you.    \\
255 - Well, then why would she rather spend the day with Leonard?    \\
256 - Because he's her son?    \\
257 - Amy, I just feel like we're going in circles.    \\
258 - You-- What?    \\
259 - No knock? What's the fracas?    \\
260 - (groans)    \\
261 - I am so stupid.    \\
262 - I-I actually thought my mom was genuinely proud of me.    \\
263 - It turns out, she's just using me as research for her new book.    \\
264 - Oh, what a relief.    \\
265 - I thought Beverly was mad at me.\\
266 - Thank you, Leonard.    \\
267 - That is a weight off my shoulders.    \\
268 - If you like her so much you can have her, 'cause I-I'm done.    \\
269 - Oh, great.\\
270 - Catch the two of you later.    \\
271 - Sheldon, no.    \\
272 - Why?    \\
273 - Well, it's an emotionally complex issue.    \\
274 - I don't have time to explain it right now.    \\
275 - Okay, but that excuse is running out of steam.    \\
276 - Well, Raj is probably on his way to the airport.    \\
277 - Yeah.    \\
278 - Guess he's finally getting his big romantic movie moment.    \\
279 - With a woman who doesn't care about big romantic movie moments.    \\
280 - Well, he'll have the rest of his life to explain them to her.    \\
281 - You can't really think this is a good idea.    \\
282 - Of course I don't.\\
283 - What am I supposed to do?    \\
284 - Go stop him. Get your best friend back.    \\
285 - (chuckles softly)    \\
286 - - You're my best friend.\\
287 - - We don't have time for this!    \\
288 - Go!    \\
289 - You know, Leonard was really upset.    \\
290 - Shouldn't you go talk to him?    \\
291 - And send the message that he can get what he wants by throwing a tantrum?\\
292 - I don't think so.    \\
293 - Beverly, put down your phone and go apologize to your son.    \\
294 - Oh, so now you're not talking to me?    \\
295 - When you're finished with your tantrum, I'd be glad to.    \\
296 - (groans)    \\
297 - Just let me know when you're done.    \\
298 - Oh, my God.    \\
299 - When am I gonna stop trying to win her approval?    \\
300 - E-Every time I'm around her, I-I turn into this needy little eight-year-old boy.    \\
301 - You sound like that now and she's not even here.    \\
302 - If I could respond more compassionately than Sheldon... and thank you for making it so easy.    \\
303 - The need for a mother's approval is baked into our biology.    \\
304 - I know that, it's just... after all these years, you'd think I would have learned.    \\
305 - Hmm. It's too bad you didn't.    \\
306 - Well, see?    \\
307 - Compassion.    \\
308 - You okay?    \\
309 - Oh, yeah. My neck's a little stiff.    \\
310 - Maybe because my boyfriend made me sleep in a comic book store last night.    \\
311 - Bet your neck would hurt if you slept in any store.    \\
312 - Except maybe a mattress store.    \\
313 - I-I'm sorry, but I couldn't sleep at your place.    \\
314 - Mitch was really freaking me out.    \\
315 - He was freaking me out, too, but there has to be a better solution.    \\
316 - Tonight we'll go back to my place.    \\
317 - And tomorrow?    \\
318 - With my health being what it is, I try to live one day at a time.    \\
319 - I don't want to blame you, but if you'd moved in with me when I asked you to, we wouldn't be in this situation.    \\
320 - You're right.    \\
321 - It's my fault.    \\
322 - When I had the chance, I was scared and... now that I want to, you're stuck with Mitch.    \\
323 - So you do want to move in with me?    \\
324 - More than Galactus wants to devour worlds.    \\
325 - Well, that's great 'cause I want to move in with you more than the Thing wants to clobber.    \\
326 - More than Hulk wants to smash?    \\
327 - More than Batman wants to ignore the due process of law.    \\
328 - We are so weird.    \\
329 - WOLOWITZ: Raj! Stop!    \\
330 - (panting)\\
331 - What?    \\
332 - What are you doing here?    \\
333 - Look... if you're getting on that plane because you love Anu and you...    \\
334 - can't stand the thought of spending another day without her... then go.    \\
335 - If not... then stay here with...the people who love you.    \\
336 - But what if this is my last chance at marriage and family?    \\
337 - I promise you it's not.    \\
338 - Believe me, somewhere out there is a woman who loves cooking shows and sweater vests and...  all the other dumb things you love.    \\
339 - You really think so?    \\
340 - Yes.    \\
341 - And I don't think she's... waiting for you in England.    \\
342 - When you propose to someone in Notting Hill... it should be to someone who knows what that movie is.    \\
343 - Are you saying... you're just a boy... standing in front of another boy... saying you don't want him to leave?    \\
344 - Sure.    \\
345 - I love you, buddy.    \\
346 - I love you, too.    \\
347 - No.    \\
348 - No, no, that's not what's happening here.    \\
349 - Come on.    \\
350 - How'd you get past security?    \\
351 - I had to buy a ticket.\\
352 - You owe me  ,    bucks.    \\
353 - Penny, can I have a moment alone    \\
354 - - with my...?\\
355 - - Yep, bye.    \\
356 - Have you calmed down?    \\
357 - No, I'm not calm.\\
358 - You really hurt me.    \\
359 - - That wasn't my intention.\\
360 - - It doesn't matter what you intended.    \\
361 - What matters is the way you made me feel.    \\
362 - Actually, the way y-you've always made me feel.    \\
363 - I see, so... you're here to tell me all the ways    \\
364 - - that I failed you as a mother.\\
365 - - Yeah.    \\
366 - And get comfortable, 'cause i-it's a long list.    \\
367 - (exhales)    \\
368 - Is it happening soon?    \\
369 - You know what?\\
370 - It doesn't matter.    \\
371 - Doesn't matter, you're never gonna change.    \\
372 - If I want you to accept me for me, then I guess I'm gonna have to accept you for you.    \\
373 - So...    \\
374 - I forgive you.    \\
375 - - I didn't ask you to forgive me.\\
376 - - Too bad.    \\
377 - I forgive you anyway.    \\
378 - And I forgive myself for taking so long to do it.    \\
379 - Oh, my God, that feels so good.    \\
380 - I must admit, it... it does feel good.    \\
381 - What does?    \\
382 - You forgiving me.    \\
383 - It means a lot.    \\
384 - Thank you.    \\
385 - (sniffles)    \\
386 - Look, I was... scared to move in, but that was a mistake because she is amazing and I really want to live with her.    \\
387 - So...think you'd be willing to find another place?    \\
388 - Do you love her?    \\
389 - Oh, we haven't really said that yet.    \\
390 - Yeah, I do.    \\
391 - Don't say it to me, say it to her.    \\
392 - I love you.    \\
393 - I love you, too.    \\
394 - Now both of you say it to me.
\subsection {Episode 23: The Stockholm Syndrome}
1 - Previously, on The Big Bang Theory...  \\
2 - Guess I'm your new neighbor.\\
3 - Penny.  \\
4 - - Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.\\
5 - - Hi.  \\
6 - - Hi.\\
7 - - Hi.  \\
8 - - Hi.\\
9 - - Hi.  \\
10 - That's where I sit.  \\
11 - Howard Wolowitz.  \\
12 - Caltech Department of Applied Physics.  \\
13 - Penny?   \\
14 - Leonard.   \\
15 - Raj?   \\
16 - WOLOWITZ: He speaks English-- he just can't speak to women.   \\
17 - LEONARD: Our babies will be smart and beautiful.   \\
18 - Finally caught a break.   \\
19 -  Soft kitty...    \\
20 - You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.   \\
21 - MRS. WOLOWITZ (calls): Howard, I'm hungry!   \\
22 -  Warm kitty...    \\
23 - (screams)   \\
24 -  Little ball of fur...    \\
25 - I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.   \\
26 - Bazinga.   \\
27 - (tires squeal, horn honks)   \\
28 - (gasping, yelling)   \\
29 - Welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents \\
30 - Fun with Flags. \\
31 - I'm going up in space.\\
32 - Technically, I'm an astronaut. \\
33 - Oy vey! \\
34 - You're talking to me.   \\
35 - I am.\\
36 - (gasps)   \\
37 - Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...   \\
38 - We now pronounce you husband and wife.   \\
39 - Amy?   \\
40 - Howard?   \\
41 - Angry Amy?   \\
42 - I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates that you...   \\
43 - I love you, too.   \\
44 - Will you marry me?   \\
45 - (softly): Yes.\\
46 - (chuckles)   \\
47 - We did it!   \\
48 - Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.   \\
49 - I wonder which one's Halley.   \\
50 - (baby bawling loudly)   \\
51 - Will you marry me?   \\
52 - WOLOWITZ: That... means... positive?   \\
53 - (gasps)\\
54 - Super asymmetry, that's it!   \\
55 - AMY: Our paper was right. \\
56 - - We did it!\\
57 - - We did it?   \\
58 - We did it!   \\
59 -  Six times ten to the eighth atoms    \\
60 -  Of a radium in a lead jar    \\
61 -  Six times ten to the eighth atoms of radium    \\
62 -  If the half-life of radium should happen to pass    \\
63 -  Three times ten to the eighth atoms    \\
64 -  Of a radium in a lead jar...    \\
65 - PENNY: Really hope you're almost to zero.   \\
66 - No, see, that's the beauty of half-lives: it's impossible to determine when you'll arrive at zero.   \\
67 - It's like "Wheels on the Bus" if the bus had an unknowable number of parts.   \\
68 - Yeah, we're gonna need more coffee.   \\
69 - Yep. I'm with you.\\
70 - Leonard, coffee?   \\
71 - Black and strong, like Luke Cage.   \\
72 - I'm too tired to even be disturbed by that.   \\
73 - Sheldon?   \\
74 - Mm, absolutely not, no.   \\
75 - The Nobel committee will be making the calls to inform the winners at any minute, so the only drug I need is the endorphins pumping through my brain in anticipation of our victory.   \\
76 - Well, technically, anticipation wouldn't be mediated by endorphins as much as dopamine, but, you know, you've been up all night, so I'll give you that one.   \\
77 - Really? The second he stops talking?   \\
78 - Well... should we wake him up?   \\
79 - Well, he did say if he fell asleep, we were allowed to slap him awake.   \\
80 - Oh, boy.   \\
81 - Wait a minute.\\
82 - Why do you get to do it?   \\
83 - 'Cause I called it.   \\
84 - Well, you can't just call it.\\
85 - You have to earn it.   \\
86 - Oh, and you've earned it?   \\
87 - No one has earned it more than me.   \\
88 - (Amy clearing throat)   \\
89 - You have your whole life to smack him around.   \\
90 - This is my time.   \\
91 - Fine. Don't miss.   \\
92 - It's not a volleyball.\\
93 - I can handle it.   \\
94 - Oh, wait. Hang on.   \\
95 - When you're old, you are gonna want a record of this.   \\
96 - Oh, oh, yeah.   \\
97 - Do it in slo-mo.\\
98 - I want to see his cheeks ripple.   \\
99 - Ready... go.   \\
100 - (ringtone playing)\\
101 - (gasps) It's happening!    \\
102 - Unknown caller.\\
103 - It's got to be them.    \\
104 - Okay, put it on speaker.    \\
105 - - Hello?\\
106 - - Hi.    \\
107 - MAN:\\
108 - Hello. This is Sweden calling.    \\
109 - Is this Dr. Cooper and Dr. Fowler?    \\
110 - - Yes.\\
111 - - Yeah.    \\
112 - Congratulations.    \\
113 - It is my pleasure to inform you that you've won the Nobel Prize in being suckers...!    \\
114 - His Swedish accent was very convincing.    \\
115 - (ringtone playing)\\
116 - (gasps) This is it!    \\
117 - What do you want, Howard?    \\
118 - We were just calling to see if you'd heard yet.    \\
119 - We haven't.    \\
120 - But thank you for getting up so early to call.    \\
121 - That was very thoughtful.    \\
122 - Oh, please. We have two little kids.    \\
123 - We've been up for an hour.    \\
124 - WOLOWITZ: Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?    \\
125 - No.    \\
126 - Okay, well, call us when you hear.    \\
127 - All right, now what?    \\
128 - Oh, why don't we play a game to pass the time?    \\
129 - Here. Uh, I am thinking of a number.    \\
130 - Hint: it's a cube of a cube of a prime.    \\
131 - There's an infinite number of possibilities.    \\
132 - What, you got somewhere to be?    \\
133 - (ringtone playing)    \\
134 - Oh. That's me.    \\
135 - Hello?    \\
136 - Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.    \\
137 - I see.    \\
138 - Okay, thank you.    \\
139 - We won.    \\
140 - (gasps)    \\
141 - Congratulations!    \\
142 - Oh, my God!    \\
143 - - We did it.\\
144 - -I know.    \\
145 - Can you believe it?\\
146 - (gasps)    \\
147 - That's a good point.\\
148 - What if I'm dreaming?    \\
149 - (yelps)    \\
150 - We won the Nobel Prize!    \\
151 - (screaming)    \\
152 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state     \\
153 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!     \\
154 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
155 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools     \\
156 -  We built the Wall \\
157 -  We built the pyramids     \\
158 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery     \\
159 -  That all started with a big bang     \\
160 -  Bang!     \\
161 - And how does it feel to be married to a Nobel Prize winner?    \\
162 - You tell me.    \\
163 - Oh. Amy-centric-- what a fun way to look at it.    \\
164 - I think so.    \\
165 - You would. That makes sense.    \\
166 - (phone vibrates)\\
167 - Ooh.    \\
168 - Aw. It's a congratulations text from my meemaw.    \\
169 - (phone vibrates) Ooh. Oh, and there's one from my mom.    \\
170 - (phone vibrates)\\
171 - And my sister.    \\
172 - (phone vibrates)\\
173 - Oh, and my brother.    \\
174 - (phone vibrates)\\
175 - And my brother's ex-wife.    \\
176 - (phone vibrates)\\
177 - My brother's other ex-wife.    \\
178 - Boy, they don't tell you when you win a Nobel it chews up your phone battery.    \\
179 - (phone vibrates)\\
180 - AMY: Oh, that's me.    \\
181 - It's CVS.\\
182 - My prescription's ready.    \\
183 - (phone vibrates)\\
184 - Oh, and also my dad.    \\
185 - He says congratulations and he loves me.    \\
186 - Nothing about me?    \\
187 - (phone vibrates)\\
188 - Oh.    \\
189 - Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.    \\
190 - You know, when you think about it, now that we're Nobel Prize winners, our names will be linked together forever.    \\
191 - We're married.    \\
192 - Our names are already linked together forever.    \\
193 - Oh, please. That's just a piece of paper.    \\
194 - This is a piece of paper and a medal.    \\
195 - AMY: It's weird.    \\
196 - I don't really feel different, but I guess our lives will never be the same.    \\
197 - Oh, I don't know. We're going to work like always.    \\
198 - I still put my pants on both legs at a time.    \\
199 - One day that's gonna end very badly.    \\
200 - (reporters shouting)    \\
201 - Congratulations.\\
202 - How does it feel?    \\
203 - Okay, w-we're happy to answer your questions, Just, um, one at a time, please?    \\
204 - REPORTER: Dr. Cooper!    \\
205 - Is Dr. Cooper coming back?    \\
206 - No. Next question.    \\
207 - (reporters shouting)    \\
208 - Was it your left hand or your right hand?    \\
209 - Right.    \\
210 - Spit actually flew out of his mouth.    \\
211 - SIEBERT: Hey, fellas.    \\
212 - Can you do me a favor?    \\
213 - Do we have a choice?    \\
214 - Ha-ha!    \\
215 - No.    \\
216 - Sheldon and Amy are now officially superstars, and the press will be reaching out to their family and friends for comment.    \\
217 - So that we're all on the same page, the word we're gonna use to describe them is "quirky."    \\
218 - And not quirky. More like quirky. \\
219 - So not Mr. and Mrs. Wackadoodle?    \\
220 - SIEBERT: Ho-ho-ho!    \\
221 - You bitter, envious little man.    \\
222 - Thank you so much.    \\
223 - And what do we call that?    \\
224 - - Quirky. - Quirky.\\
225 - - Quirky.    \\
226 - Dr. Cooper, can I get a minute of your time?    \\
227 - Hello?    \\
228 - Hey.    \\
229 - - Can I help you?\\
230 - - Uh, yeah, actually.    \\
231 - Um, I had an appointment to interview Dr. Cooper about the Nobel.    \\
232 - Hang on a second.    \\
233 - Sheldon?    \\
234 - Sorry, he's not here.    \\
235 - Damn. I've got a deadline.    \\
236 - I don't know if it helps you at all, but I'm his best friend in the whole world.    \\
237 - Really?    \\
238 - And an astronaut. Come on, you can buy me a cup of coffee, and I'll tell you about both.    \\
239 - (Amy sobbing)    \\
240 - Everyone okay in there?    \\
241 - Go away!    \\
242 - Amy?    \\
243 - Raj, please, not now.    \\
244 - Hey, what's wrong?    \\
245 - My picture's all over the Internet, and I look terrible.    \\
246 - No. Let me see.    \\
247 - Well, that is an unfortunate angle.    \\
248 - But who cares?    \\
249 - You just won the Nobel.    \\
250 - You should be proud of this moment.    \\
251 - I know I shouldn't care about how I look, and I never thought I did.    \\
252 - It-It's stupid and shallow, but I just can't help it.    \\
253 - Am I really this frumpy?    \\
254 - No. No, you are a beautiful woman.    \\
255 - By the way, if you're not happy with those pictures, then make some changes.    \\
256 - Get a haircut, new clothes, new glasses, big glasses...    \\
257 - No glasses-- then you won't be able to see those pictures.    \\
258 - Sounds expensive.    \\
259 - Excuse me, i-if I'm not mistaken, the Nobel comes with a substantial cash prize.    \\
260 - What were you gonna spend it on?    \\
261 - Hadn't really thought about it.    \\
262 - Sheldon's got his eyes on some new Dockers.    \\
263 - Come on. Do something for yourself.    \\
264 - Well, I suppose I could get a haircut.    \\
265 - And some makeup and a new wardrobe and a little thank you gift for your shopping buddy if we see something he likes. Come on.    \\
266 - Where are we going?    \\
267 - Beverly Hills, where the things he likes are.    \\
268 - Dinner ready?    \\
269 - Not unless you cooked.    \\
270 - Why is this article about Sheldon all about you?    \\
271 - Let me see.    \\
272 - Oh, good, they used my NASA picture.    \\
273 - Why does it say that you're his best friend?    \\
274 - Leonard's his best friend.    \\
275 - No. Leonard has always been kind of a monkey butler.    \\
276 - Whenever Sheldon got into a scrape, I was his go-to guy.    \\
277 - (chuckles)    \\
278 - When did he get into a scrape?    \\
279 - You're kidding, right?    \\
280 - W-- Remember when he had a panic attack    \\
281 - 'cause his hand got stuck in a jar of olives?    \\
282 - I was the one who told him to let go of the olives.    \\
283 - Please, that doesn't make you his best friend.    \\
284 - (chuckles)    \\
285 - You know, that reporter asked me if I could put him in touch with...    \\
286 - Amy's best friend.    \\
287 - That's Penny.    \\
288 - (singsongy):\\
289 - Doesn't have to be.    \\
290 - Hmm.    \\
291 - What kind of tea is appropriate for winning a Nobel Prize and now everything is changing and you feel unmoored from reality?    \\
292 - I don't know. Earl Grey?    \\
293 - You know, this is something I've wanted my whole life.    \\
294 - But I guess I never considered how everything would be different.    \\
295 - Buddy, I-I know it all feels overwhelming right now, but I promise you, things will settle down.    \\
296 - There's no Earl Grey!    \\
297 - You filthy liar!    \\
298 - (knocking at door)    \\
299 - Hey, is Penny here?    \\
300 - No. Why?    \\
301 - I wanted to show her my latest creation.    \\
302 - I give you...    \\
303 - Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.    \\
304 - Wow. Amy, you look amazing.    \\
305 - Thank you.    \\
306 - Sheldon, what do you think?    \\
307 - I like you better the way you were.    \\
308 - But she looks beautiful!    \\
309 - Classic lines, colors that complement her skin tone, and hair that goes from "office" to "on the town" in minutes.    \\
310 - I don't care.\\
311 - Put it back.    \\
312 - I like the way I look.    \\
313 - Well, I don't!    \\
314 - (door opens)    \\
315 - My fault.\\
316 - I was out of Earl Grey.    \\
317 - (clears throat)    \\
318 - Sheldon, that was really rude.    \\
319 - I'm sorry. Amy is the one constant I can count on, and now she's changing.    \\
320 - It's just a haircut and some clothes.    \\
321 - No, it's the last straw!    \\
322 - I can't take any more!    \\
323 - (elevator bell dings)    \\
324 - Can you believe it?    \\
325 - They finally fixed the elevator.    \\
326 - This is a nightmare.    \\
327 - What's with him?    \\
328 - He won a Nobel Prize, and his wife looks amazing.    \\
329 - Oh. Yeah, got it.    \\
330 - (panting)    \\
331 - (gasping, panting)    \\
332 - How did you get down here?    \\
333 - The elevator. It's really fast.    \\
334 - I-I need to be alone right now.    \\
335 - Don't try to follow me.    \\
336 - All right.\\
337 - You need a ride?    \\
338 - That'd be great.\\
339 - Thank you.    \\
340 - I should've seen this coming.    \\
341 - Oh, stop. You're allowed to get a haircut.    \\
342 - I know.    \\
343 - But I should've done it gradually.    \\
344 - You know, like...  maybe     tiny haircuts over a ten-year period.    \\
345 - Okay, you need to focus on the positive.    \\
346 - You won a Nobel Prize.    \\
347 - I slapped Sheldon.    \\
348 - A lot of dreams came true today.    \\
349 - You know, you're right.    \\
350 - This is a huge day for me, and I'm allowed to enjoy it without worrying how it's going to affect my husband.    \\
351 - Is it me or did it just get fierce in here?    \\
352 - All this change is just too much.    \\
353 - The reporters, the attention at work, and now even Amy's changed.    \\
354 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.    \\
355 - - Slow down.\\
356 - - I'm playing a drinking game.    \\
357 - Every time you say the word "change,"    \\
358 - I take a slug.    \\
359 - Are you gonna be able to drive me home?    \\
360 - Mm. Not unless you change the subject.    \\
361 - Huh. Now I said it.    \\
362 - Meh. Hmm.    \\
363 - You know, you're the only person who could win the biggest prize in science and still be upset about it.    \\
364 - It's just... all the times I thought about winning,    \\
365 - I never thought about how it would ch-- affect my life.    \\
366 - I'm sorry, I'm genuinely concerned about your liver.    \\
367 - (chuckles):\\
368 - Okay.    \\
369 - Fine, I'll stop playing.    \\
370 - You know, you go on and on about wanting things to stay the same, but you've changed a lot since I met you.    \\
371 - Oh, you are a mean drunk.    \\
372 - I'm serious.    \\
373 - You have a ton of friends, you got married, moved into a new apartment, you wore a baseball hat that one time.    \\
374 - Heck, you've had s*x almost as many times as I have fingers.    \\
375 - More.    \\
376 - W...    \\
377 - By this many.    \\
378 - You dog!    \\
379 - It was the Avengers trailer.    \\
380 - Oh.    \\
381 - Mm-hmm.    \\
382 - You know, I've grown, too.\\
383 - I used to be the bartender back there.\\
384 - - That's true.    \\
385 - And now there is a completely different woman who botched my drink order.    \\
386 - How hard is   % Coke,   % Diet Coke?    \\
387 - Well, judging by the look on her face, it's at least one percent saliva.    \\
388 - I do take your point.    \\
389 - You know, you're also married, you have a successful career, you no longer dress like you're trying to attract sailors by the wharf.    \\
390 - So, I guess the only thing that actually stays the same is that things are always changing.    \\
391 - Interesting.    \\
392 - So you're saying the inevitability of change might be a universal constant.    \\
393 - Well, there's a little more to it than that, but, yeah, sure.    \\
394 - Oh. Hey, look, that's Bernadette.    \\
395 - I can't tell you how many times Dr. Fowler was gonna give up and I would say to her, "Amy, as your best friend, I'm not gonna let you quit."    \\
396 - Okay, I'm drinking again.    \\
397 - I'll join you. Waitress, uh,   % Hawaiian Punch, five percent vodka.    \\
398 - WOLOWITZ: Let me tell you about the time    \\
399 - Mr. Nobel Laureate wanted olives...    \\
400 - (laughs)\\
401 - This is a good one.    \\
402 - You know what,   /  !    \\
403 - You know, I like the way my hair looks.    \\
404 - I'm done tiptoeing around him.    \\
405 - We're all guilty of it.    \\
406 - But why?    \\
407 - 'Cause we were afraid to upset him.    \\
408 - Which happens anyway.    \\
409 - Well, that's over.    \\
410 - I'm-I'm done enabling him.\\
411 - Like, this is his spot and-and the thermostat has to be set to his comfort level, even though he doesn't even live here anymore and I'm always chilly.    \\
412 - Is that why you wear a hoodie all the time?    \\
413 - Why would-- Yes!    \\
414 - To accommodate Sheldon!    \\
415 - And what-what about this-this thing?    \\
416 - Why is it here?\\
417 - I'll tell you why.    \\
418 - Because it was here when I moved in, and, for no earthly reason, he forbade me to touch it.    \\
419 - Well, if you don't like it, get rid of it.    \\
420 - Put it in the closet.    \\
421 - You know what, I will.    \\
422 - I bet that's the reason.    \\
423 - Hang on.    \\
424 - What do you think?    \\
425 - Want to give it a try?    \\
426 - (elevator bell dings)    \\
427 - Well, you know, the elevator did work when I moved into the building.    \\
428 - So going up and down the stairs was a change, which means this would actually be a return to the status quo.    \\
429 - - But, conversely, I think...\\
430 - - Get in!    \\
431 - SHELDON: This is wild.    \\
432 - Carbon.    \\
433 - Hydrogen.    \\
434 - Carbon.    \\
435 - Carbon.    \\
436 - And last but not least,    \\
437 - carbon.    \\
438 - This might be the glue talking, but that was a very pleasurable    and a half hours.    \\
439 - Agreed.    \\
440 - What kind of DNA is this, anyway?    \\
441 - I was trying to design the genetic code of an advanced race of human being.    \\
442 - One of my rare failures, actually.    \\
443 - What went wrong?    \\
444 - The balls kept sticking to my pants.    \\
445 - Let's just let it dry.    \\
446 - - Hi. - Hello.\\
447 - - Hey, babe.    \\
448 - Oh, don't slam the...\\
449 - Don't slam the...    \\
450 - (gasps)    \\
451 - That was exhilarating.    \\
452 - - You pick up your dresses?\\
453 - AMY: Yep.    \\
454 - The tailor had to take mine in and let Penny's out.    \\
455 - Best day of my life.    \\
456 - What about the day you met me?    \\
457 - I stand by my statement.    \\
458 - Well, thank you guys so much for the clothes and the shoes, the plane tickets.    \\
459 - You've been so generous.    \\
460 - Well, it's important that all of our friends get to share this moment with us.    \\
461 - And then for years to come, you can tell others you had a front-row seat to history.    \\
462 - Although, technically,    \\
463 - I think your seats are in the second row.    \\
464 - Do you want to go back to the apartment and see me try on my dress?    \\
465 - Shouldn't I see it for the first time at the Nobel ceremony?    \\
466 - It's not a wedding.    \\
467 - Okay. Well, give me a minute to think of another reason I don't want to see it.    \\
468 - How about this-- you can practice your acceptance speech while I try on the dress.    \\
469 - Ah, great. You can help me whittle it down to    minutes.    \\
470 - Was Amy suspicious when they had to let your dress out?    \\
471 - No. She was so happy, she didn't even question it.    \\
472 - Someone's gonna figure it out.\\
473 - Why don't we just tell people?    \\
474 - No, it's too early.    \\
475 - I haven't even wrapped my head around it.    \\
476 - - I have. My head is wrapped.\\
477 - - Yeah, well... if something else had been wrapped, we wouldn't be in this situation.    \\
478 - Excuse me, but if I recall, you're the one who went out drinking with Sheldon, then came home and attacked me.    \\
479 - Attacked you? I said, "Do you wanna?"    \\
480 - Yeah.    \\
481 - - I was helpless.\\
482 - -Uh-huh.    \\
483 - So...    \\
484 - (laughs): do you wanna?    \\
485 - - Well, I can't get more pregnant.\\
486 - - Mm-hmm.    \\
487 - We'll see about that.    \\
488 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state     \\
489 -  Then nearly    billion years ago expansion started... Wait!     \\
490 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
491 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools     \\
492 -  We built the Wall \\
493 -  We built the pyramids     \\
494 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery     \\
495 -  That all started with a big bang     \\
496 -  Bang!     \\
497 - Now, Michael, Mommy and Daddy are going away for a couple days,  so if you're gonna say your first words, you got to do it now or wait till we get back.    \\
498 - WOLOWITZ: Somebody just peed in the big girl potty.    \\
499 - BERNADETTE: Oh, I'm so proud!    \\
500 - It was her, right?    \\
501 - Yes.    \\
502 - You still feel good about leaving them with Stuart and Denise for a couple days?    \\
503 - I guess. I just hope we don't miss Michael's first words.    \\
504 - Or Stuart's last words.    \\
505 - You realize it's been years since we've got away just the two of us.    \\
506 - I know. I can't wait.    \\
507 - Fancy hotel room.\\
508 - The big bed.    \\
509 - Yeah. We're gonna sleep our asses off.    \\
510 - You really think walking her is gonna help me meet girls?    \\
511 - Cinnamon is chick bait.    \\
512 - Good. 'Cause I'm not.    \\
513 - Just remember, you're in charge.    \\
514 - Don't let her pull you. \\
515 - That seems like an unnecessary thing to say.    \\
516 - And please, if you have any problems, any questions, call me immediately, okay?    \\
517 - She's my baby.    \\
518 - It shouldn't come up, but just in case: where could I buy a dog that looks exactly like her?    \\
519 - Kidding. If she dies, I'll just tell you.    \\
520 - Ready?    \\
521 - Oh. Hang on.    \\
522 - Go.    \\
523 - "Your majesties, members of the Nobel Academy--    \\
524 - "when I was a young boy growing up in East Texas    \\
525 - "I always knew I'd wind up on this stage,    \\
526 - "and everybody who said I wouldn't looks    \\
527 - "pretty darn foolish right now. I'm talking about you, high school science teacher Mr. Hubert Givens..."    \\
528 - Sheldon, Sheldon.\\
529 - Why are you talking so fast?    \\
530 - I'm trying to get my speech down to    minutes.    \\
531 - Nobody's gonna be able to understand a word you're saying.    \\
532 - Welcome to my life.    \\
533 - I think you need to do some editing, like maybe cut out all that stuff about your childhood.    \\
534 - Are you kidding? Growing up in the backwoods of East Texas is what makes me warm and relatable.    \\
535 - Well, what about all these pages calling out everyone who said you wouldn't succeed?    \\
536 - I told them all they would rue the day.    \\
537 - How is it gonna make me look if the day finally comes, and they're not filled with rue?    \\
538 - Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.    \\
539 - This is about... humbly accepting a great honor.    \\
540 - Amy, we won the Nobel Prize in Physics.    \\
541 - Humility is for people who win the goofy Nobels like Literature, Economics and Peace.    \\
542 - Please tell me that's not in your speech.    \\
543 - Oh. I can cut it, but it's the only joke I have.    \\
544 - All right, bagels down.\\
545 - Before we head to the airport, I'd like to go over a few things.    \\
546 - (others groaning)    \\
547 - From the moment we step off the plane, each and every one of you is an ambassador for Amy and myself.    \\
548 - (quietly): I told you these tickets weren't free.    \\
549 - As such, your behavior must reflect the highest standards.    \\
550 - Uh, Raj. Bagel down.    \\
551 - If my blood sugar drops and I get bitchy, it's on you.    \\
552 - Amy, why don't you kick us off.    \\
553 - Thank you.    \\
554 - "The challenging climate of Scandinavia    \\
555 - "has left its mark on the Swedish character.    \\
556 - "These dour, latter-day Vikings    \\
557 - "are slow to warm up to strangers,    \\
558 - "but if you follow a few easy steps, a Swede can be your friend for life."    \\
559 - SHELDON: "Number one,    \\
560 - "in Sweden, punctuality is taken very seriously.    \\
561 - "In other words, the loosey-goosey attitude in Helsinki will not fly in Stockholm."    \\
562 - AMY: "Two, at the beginning    \\
563 - "and end of all business and social meetings,    \\
564 - "shake hands with everyone present-- men, women and children."    \\
565 - Yes, you're all encouraged to pair off and practice this once we're in the air and the seat belt sign is off.    \\
566 - Yes, Penny?\\
567 - Oh.    \\
568 - Do we have to go?    \\
569 - Yes. And a reminder, Penny, there's free alcohol in business class-- don't abuse it.    \\
570 - Relax. I'm not gonna drink.    \\
571 - Why? You pregnant?\\
572 - (laughs): Wha...? No.    \\
573 - No, I just, you know, I don't like to drink when I fly.    \\
574 - Please. I've seen you drink in the shower.    \\
575 - You guys have showered together?    \\
576 - Sometimes you're just...    \\
577 - ech.    \\
578 - That wasn't a no.\\
579 - (chuckles)    \\
580 - SHELDON: All right, well, we should head out now if we're gonna get to the airport six hours before boarding.    \\
581 - Excuse me. Hello?\\
582 - What did we just learn about the end of business meetings?    \\
583 - Oh, my God.\\
584 - (others groaning)    \\
585 - (all grumbling)\\
586 - Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.    \\
587 - Go on.    \\
588 - You first. Go.    \\
589 - AMY: Wait.    \\
590 - BERNADETTE: Help me!\\
591 - Oh.    \\
592 - Help me!\\
593 - Oh, wait. Come here.    \\
594 - - We got this.\\
595 - - Yeah, get in, get in, get in.    \\
596 - (yelling)    \\
597 - Hang on.    \\
598 - I've-I've got an idea.    \\
599 - (bell dings)    \\
600 - Well done. You know, you're proving to be an invaluable part of my entourage.    \\
601 - Cool.    \\
602 - Yeah?    \\
603 - - How you doing?\\
604 - - Fine. Why?    \\
605 - Well, this is the furthest we've ever been away from the kids.    \\
606 - I was just checking to see if you're okay.    \\
607 - I'm on my second Jack Reacher. I'm doing great.    \\
608 - Good. Me, too.    \\
609 - I was just looking at the map.    \\
610 - Couldn't help thinking: we're here and they're there, and if anything happened, we'd have to go here to get all the way back there.    \\
611 - Why are you trying to freak me out?    \\
612 - This is our vacation.    \\
613 - I thought we should do things together.    \\
614 - Howard, the kids are okay.    \\
615 - How do you know that?    \\
616 - I just know.\\
617 - A mother knows.    \\
618 - So what, now the Force is with you?    \\
619 - Let's see.    \\
620 - This is not the woman you want to annoy.    \\
621 - - Howard. Howard.\\
622 - - What?    \\
623 - You see the woman sitting next to me?    \\
624 - What about her?    \\
625 - Is this her?    \\
626 - Buffy the Vampire Slayer?    \\
627 - Shh! Be cool.    \\
628 - - No, that's not her.\\
629 - - Okay.    \\
630 - How about now?    \\
631 - Uh-oh.    \\
632 - That's the fourth time she's been to the bathroom in the last two hours.    \\
633 - So?    \\
634 - Her breakfast was binding. I made sure of that.    \\
635 - - So?\\
636 - - So she clearly has some sort of stomach distress.    \\
637 - If it's viral, we're all susceptible.    \\
638 - She's probably just airsick.    \\
639 - Yeah, but what if she's not?    \\
640 - What if we get what she has?    \\
641 - What if we infect the King of Sweden?    \\
642 - That's how wars start.    \\
643 - All right, that's it, this is Outbreak and she's the monkey.    \\
644 - (quietly):\\
645 - Wait. Stop.    \\
646 - Be reasonable.    \\
647 - Leonard... we need to do something about your wife.    \\
648 - - What's the matter?\\
649 - - She is clearly sick, and she's gonna take us all down with her.    \\
650 - She's not sick, Sheldon.    \\
651 - She is, and I'm gonna catch it, and it's gonna ruin the greatest day of my life.    \\
652 - I promise you're not going to get what she has.    \\
653 - What's going on?    \\
654 - (gasps)\\
655 - Unclean! Unclean!    \\
656 - What?    \\
657 - He thinks you're sick.    \\
658 - Oh.    \\
659 - Should we tell him?    \\
660 - Well, if we don't, he might try and jump out of the plane.\\
661 - - Yeah.    \\
662 - Doesn't answer my question.    \\
663 - Tell me what?    \\
664 - (sighs)\\
665 - I'm pregnant, Sheldon.    \\
666 - You're right, I can't catch that.    \\
667 - (groans)    \\
668 - Good news, Amy.    \\
669 - She's just pregnant.    \\
670 - Are you kidding me?    \\
671 - You just found out that a woman who has loved and cared for you for    years is pregnant, and all you can say is you're relieved that she's not gonna get you sick?    \\
672 - There's no need for a recap.    \\
673 - I was there.    \\
674 - - Why didn't you tell me?\\
675 - - I didn't tell anybody.    \\
676 - I'm not anybody.\\
677 - I'm your best friend.    \\
678 - - What's going on?\\
679 - - She's pregnant.    \\
680 - That's fantastic!    \\
681 - Why didn't you tell me?    \\
682 - She didn't tell me, either.    \\
683 - But I'm her best friend.    \\
684 - (chuckles) We'll get into that later.    \\
685 - What happened to "I'm never gonna have kids"?    \\
686 - It was an accident. I went out drinking with Sheldon.    \\
687 - (gasps) Oh, my gosh.    \\
688 - We're sister wives?    \\
689 - No. Then I went home and slept with Leonard.    \\
690 - - While fantasizing about...\\
691 - - Leonard.    \\
692 - And a little Idris Elba.    \\
693 - - I mean, ah...\\
694 - - Oh, yeah.    \\
695 - What would you like me to say?    \\
696 - How about congratulating us?    \\
697 - Are congratulations even in order?    \\
698 - I didn't think Penny wanted children.    \\
699 - Well, she didn't, now she does. And just so you know, we weren't gonna tell anybody    \\
700 - so we wouldn't upstage your big day.    \\
701 - Oh, please, you couldn't upstage us.    \\
702 - We won a Nobel Prize.    \\
703 - Any idiot can have a baby.    \\
704 - Hey. What's going on?    \\
705 - Case in point.    \\
706 - You are a selfish jerk.    \\
707 - To hell with you and your Nobel Prize.    \\
708 - I found her boarding pass in her purse.    \\
709 - It's totally her.    \\
710 - Hi, Stuart, just checking in.    \\
711 - Seeing if everything's okay.    \\
712 - Oh, yeah, we're having fun.    \\
713 - Me, Halley and Denise played hide-and-seek all day.    \\
714 - - Oh, that's nice.\\
715 - STUART: Yeah.    \\
716 - I found Denise right away.    \\
717 - Where was Halley hiding?    \\
718 - Uh, the important thing is she's not there now.    \\
719 - Okay, so, everyone's happy and healthy?    \\
720 - Well, that depends.    \\
721 - What's that mean?    \\
722 - Uh, how many teeth did Halley have when you left?    \\
723 - All of them.    \\
724 - Oh, yeah, that's-that's what I was afraid of.    \\
725 - What happened?    \\
726 - Um, well, all right.    \\
727 - Um, Michael had a little fever last night.    \\
728 - Michael had a fever?    \\
729 - Do you want to hear about Halley or not?    \\
730 - What happened, Stuart?    \\
731 - He was running a little fever, nothing to worry about.    \\
732 - And Halley, bless her heart, wanted to bring him his boo-boo bear, so she climbed over the safety rail and took a little tumble down the stairs.    \\
733 - She fell down the stairs?!    \\
734 - (stammers)\\
735 - She rolled down the stairs, laughing the whole time.\\
736 - (chuckles)    \\
737 - Anyway, when she got to the bottom, there was a tooth missing.    \\
738 - Oh, Stuart!    \\
739 - She's fine!    \\
740 - She thought it was funny.    \\
741 - Did you at least save it for the tooth fairy?    \\
742 - No, we couldn't find it.    \\
743 - We have a theory about where it is, but it'll take six to eight hours to confirm.    \\
744 - Speaking of which, where do you keep the spaghetti strainer?    \\
745 - Come on, you didn't seriously expect him to react like a normal human being.    \\
746 - No, but still, a-after all these years, after all the crap I've put up with, you'd think just this once he'd care about someone else's feelings.    \\
747 - - Oh, my God!\\
748 - - What?    \\
749 - Pickled herring. Who knew how good it was!    \\
750 - Really?    \\
751 - Sounds gross.\\
752 - Looks gross. Smells gross.    \\
753 - It's delicious!    \\
754 - (knock on door)    \\
755 - Ooh, that might be my salted cod!    \\
756 - What?    \\
757 - Sheldon has something he'd like to say.    \\
758 - SHELDON: I'm sorry I didn't react appropriately.    \\
759 - You and Penny are bringing new life into the world.    \\
760 - Congratulations. I can't wait to meet it.    \\
761 - - "It"?\\
762 - - That's a gender-neutral pronoun.    \\
763 - If you're offended, take it up with the English language.    \\
764 - Oh, good, you're here.\\
765 - Listen, we're thinking maybe we should go back to L.A.    \\
766 - - Why?\\
767 - - We just can't be this far away from the kids.    \\
768 - Bernie's having a meltdown, and, frankly, so am I.\\
769 - SHELDON: Yeah, well, pull it together. This is a big day for me.    \\
770 - (scoffs) Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do.    \\
771 - Now I am. We're going home.    \\
772 - - We'll join you.\\
773 - PENNY: Oh, wait.    \\
774 - Do I get a vote in this?    \\
775 - They'll have pickled herring on the plane.    \\
776 - Bye-bye.    \\
777 - Well, I hate to say it, but I think everyone is being incredibly selfish.    \\
778 - Well, you would be the authority on the subject.    \\
779 - What does that mean?    \\
780 - Sheldon, no one is happier than I am to win the Nobel.    \\
781 - But it's not more important than our friends.    \\
782 - How can you call them friends when they're abandoning us?    \\
783 - They're abandoning us because you broke their hearts.    \\
784 - - I didn't mean to.\\
785 - - I know!    \\
786 - You never mean to.    \\
787 - That's the only reason people tolerate you!    \\
788 - Does that include you?    \\
789 - Sometimes, yeah.    \\
790 - (Penny retching)    \\
791 - (toilet flushes)    \\
792 - (Penny groans)    \\
793 - Okay, that's it for the fish.    \\
794 - We'll be back with the meatballs after a short word from our sponsor.    \\
795 - Oh, thank you.    \\
796 - (groans)    \\
797 - Leonard, I can't go home.    \\
798 - - I have to be there for Amy.\\
799 - - Yeah.    \\
800 - I was thinking that, too.    \\
801 - As angry as I am at Sheldon, I still want to see him win that medal.    \\
802 - It's so strange.    \\
803 - No matter how thoughtless and selfish he is, I still love him.    \\
804 - If you think about it, he has kind of been our practice kid.    \\
805 - Like when you make pancakes and the first one comes out a little wonky.    \\
806 - The university prefers "quirky."    \\
807 - (chuckles)\\
808 - (phone rings)    \\
809 - Hello.    \\
810 - Hey. It's Howard.    \\
811 - Oh, us, too.    \\
812 - - Wait, what?\\
813 - - They're gonna stay.    \\
814 - The kids are fine.\\
815 - Bernie's parents took over.    \\
816 - Really?    \\
817 - Oh, poor little guy.    \\
818 - Is Michael okay?    \\
819 - Yeah, it's Stuart.    \\
820 - Bernie's dad gave him a hug, cracked a rib.    \\
821 - Yeah. Okay, we'll meet you in the lobby.    \\
822 - How long is it gonna take you to get ready?    \\
823 - Oh, I just need, like, five or ten minutes.    \\
824 - - Really?\\
825 - - No. What is wrong with you?!    \\
826 - ANNOUNCER: And in the field of physics, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler and Dr. Sheldon Cooper for their discovery of super-asymmetry.    \\
827 - (whistling)    \\
828 - (whoops)\\
829 - (cheers)    \\
830 - (whooping)    \\
831 - Just to be clear, this isn't a date.    \\
832 - Yeah, I know.    \\
833 - Then why are you holding my hand?    \\
834 - Thank you, your majesties.    \\
835 - Thank you to the Nobel Committee.    \\
836 - We are deeply honored.    \\
837 - I would just like to take this moment to say to all the young girls out there who dream about science as a profession: go for it.    \\
838 - It is the greatest job in the world.    \\
839 - And if anybody tells you you can't, don't listen.    \\
840 - And now, speaking of not listening, my husband, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.    \\
841 - Sheldon.    \\
842 - What? Did you finish? Great job.    \\
843 - Thank you, Dr. Fowler.    \\
844 - I have a very long and somewhat self-centered speech here.    \\
845 - But I'd like to set it aside.    \\
846 - PENNY: Yeah!\\
847 - WOLOWITZ: Way to go!    \\
848 - (whoops)    \\
849 - Because this honor doesn't just belong to me.    \\
850 - I wouldn't be up here if it weren't for some very important people in my life.    \\
851 - Beginning with my mother, father, meemaw, brother and sister.    \\
852 - And my other family, who I'm so happy to have here with us.    \\
853 - Is that Buffy the Vampire Slayer?    \\
854 - I was under a misapprehension that my accomplishments were mine alone.    \\
855 - Nothing could be further from the truth.    \\
856 - I have been encouraged, sustained, inspired and tolerated not only by my wife, but by the greatest group of friends anyone ever had.    \\
857 - I'd like to ask them to stand.    \\
858 - Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.    \\
859 - Dr. Bernadette Rostenkowski Wolowitz.    \\
860 - Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.    \\
861 - And my two dearest friends in the world, Penny Hofstadter...    \\
862 - ...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.    \\
863 - I was there the moment Leonard and Penny met.    \\
864 - He said to me that their babies would be smart and beautiful.    \\
865 - And now that they're expecting,    \\
866 - I have no doubt that that will be the case.    \\
867 - Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't told my parents yet, but thanks.    \\
868 - Oh. I'm sorry.    \\
869 - Don't tell anyone that last thing.    \\
870 - That's a secret.    \\
871 - Howard, Bernadette, Raj, Penny, Leonard,    \\
872 - I apologize if I haven't been the friend you deserve.    \\
873 - But I want you to know in my way, I love you all.    \\
874 - And I love you.    \\
875 - Thank you.    \\
876 - (applause)    \\
877 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state     \\
878 -  Then nearly  billion years ago     \\
879 -  Expansion started... Wait     \\
880 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
881 -  The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools     \\
882 -  We built a Wall, we built the pyramids     \\
883 -  Math, Science, History     \\
884 -  Unraveling the mystery     \\
885 -  That all started with a big bang. 
\subsection {Episode 90: Unraveling The Mystery: A Big Bang Farewell}
1 - [BIRDS SINGING]  \\
2 -  Broke into the old apartment   \\
3 -  This is where we used to live   \\
4 -  Broken windows, broke and hungry   \\
5 -  Broken hearts and broken bones   \\
6 -  This is where we used to live   \\
7 -  Broke into the old apartment...   \\
8 - MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, here they are now.  \\
9 - KALEY CUOCO: You have made every single one of these episodes these    years an absolute dream come true.   \\
10 - [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]   \\
11 -  Broke into the old apartment    \\
12 -  This is where we used to live.    \\
13 - [BUZZER SOUNDS, INDISTINCT CHATTER]   \\
14 - Hi. I'm Kaley Cuoco, and I've played Penny for the last    years on The Big Bang Theory.   \\
15 - And I'm Johnny Galecki. I've played Leonard Hofstadter.   \\
16 - - Come on, TV husband.\\
17 - - Yes, ma'am.   \\
18 - Every show night, Johnny and I have walked to this rail, climbed ourselves up and thanked our studio audience for their love and support of this show.   \\
19 - But tonight, we want to thank you, the audience at home, without whom none of this would be possible.   \\
20 - You kept us here for over a decade in a job we absolutely adore.   \\
21 - So we want to take you behind the scenes of our very special show, The Big Bang, share some secrets, some special moments, as we say good-bye   \\
22 - [VOICE BREAKING]: to a place that's been our home for a long time.   \\
23 - GALECKI: This is Stage    on the Warner Brothers lot in the exotic Burbank, California.   \\
24 - Earlier this year, it was officially renamed "The Big Bang Theory Stage".   \\
25 - I think it's only the fifth stage in the history of Warner Brothers that's been named after a show, right?   \\
26 - - That was a really special day.\\
27 - - That was a good day.   \\
28 - We've done so many crazy set-ups.   \\
29 - - [PINGING]\\
30 - - [HONKING, REVVING]   \\
31 - GALECKI: It's been a desert.   \\
32 - - A casino, hotel rooms.\\
33 - - Planetarium.   \\
34 - The wedding rooftop, International Space Station.   \\
35 - Do you remember when I asked you where the International Space Station was?   \\
36 - [LAUGHS]   \\
37 - GALECKI: I was excited to have the Dagobah set here.   \\
38 - As a kid, I was a huge Star Wars fan.   \\
39 - And then to have Bob Newhart was just incredible.   \\
40 - When Obi-Wan came to Luke, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice, so, um, what do you got for me?   \\
41 - Always...get... get a prenup.   \\
42 - CUOCO: Remember our car scenes?   \\
43 - So cars are set up here.   \\
44 - MAN: Action!   \\
45 - - Leonard, where are you going?\\
46 - - Well, to work.   \\
47 - So, when the live studio audience is-is here, we would simulate the car scenes, and then, record their laughter, so that the laughter was genuine when the show would air.   \\
48 - [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]   \\
49 - CUOCO: Our week starts on Wednesday.   \\
50 - That's our table reads.   \\
51 - GALECKI: We gather around a big table and read it aloud for the first time.   \\
52 - And do you read yours right when you get it Tuesday nights?   \\
53 - Immediately, yeah, out of respect for the writers.   \\
54 - We're aware of the weeks, if not months, of hard work they put into the script, and we're gonna show up and read it cold?   \\
55 - I read it cold every week.   \\
56 - - [LAUGHS] That's not true.\\
57 - - That's a    % true.   \\
58 - Table reads are awesome, 'cause I laugh so hard.   \\
59 - I watched the news today.\\
60 - Has the whole world gone mad?   \\
61 - [LAUGHTER]   \\
62 - - CUOCO: Hi.\\
63 - - GALECKI: Hi.   \\
64 - - Hi.\\
65 - - [LAUGHING]: Hi.   \\
66 - - Oh, hi.\\
67 - - Hi.   \\
68 - - Hi. Hi.\\
69 - - Hi.   \\
70 - Hi?   \\
71 - I just remember you and Jim   \\
72 - - and this visual of this duo.\\
73 - - I hope so.   \\
74 - - Oh, really?\\
75 - - Yeah, and I was like...   \\
76 - I just was so excited to be part of whatever was going on with the two of you.   \\
77 - - Should we have invited her for lunch?\\
78 - - No.   \\
79 - We're gonna start season two of Battlestar Galactica.   \\
80 - We already watched the season two DVDs.   \\
81 - Not with commentary.   \\
82 - I remember Jim and I getting a piece of furniture up the stair.   \\
83 - And I remember the audience laughing at a place where we didn't...   \\
84 - - Expect.\\
85 - - Expect.   \\
86 - I don't have this. I don't have this!    \\
87 - Help me out! You don't have this.    \\
88 - And then, we kind of locked eyes, like,  "Oh, this is interesting and fun".    \\
89 - Like, they're on the ride with us. They...    \\
90 - These characters. The show hadn't aired yet, and they understood the fight to these guys.    \\
91 - Ah, gravity... thou art a heartless bitch.    \\
92 - So much has happened in this apartment.    \\
93 - - Amy got her tiara.\\
94 - - [LAUGHING]: Yeah.    \\
95 -  Oh, it's a tiara!     \\
96 - A tiara. I have a tiara!    \\
97 - Put it on me. Put it on me.\\
98 - Put it on me. Put it on me.    \\
99 - Put it on me. Put it on me.\\
100 - Put it on me.    \\
101 - You look beautiful.    \\
102 - Of course I do! I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!    \\
103 - The Penny-Amy painting.    \\
104 - I wanted to get you something you didn't have.    \\
105 - CUOCO: We were laughing so hard, it took us about a good two minutes till we could actually say the dialogue.    \\
106 - We were just... The tears were, like, coming down.    \\
107 - That painting will haunt me.    \\
108 - Remember the scene where we were sitting here, very early on?    \\
109 - We were getting... We were drunk.    \\
110 - Not drunk in real life, but it was this...    \\
111 - And we got to...    \\
112 - - We were passing the lime back and forth.\\
113 - - GALECKI: Yeah.    \\
114 - Aah!    \\
115 - Where's the lime?    \\
116 - [BOTH LAUGHING]    \\
117 - Okay. We're sharing.    \\
118 - [AUDIENCE WHOOPING]    \\
119 - A lot of slumber parties with the girls.    \\
120 - [SHRIEKS]: Oh!    \\
121 - Pillow fight!    \\
122 - Ooh, all the girls reading comic books, sitting here.    \\
123 - How'd you guys finish so fast?    \\
124 - I don't know, there were a lot of pictures and one page only had the word "Brakadoom".    \\
125 - W-Why was that?    \\
126 - CUOCO: We were trying to understand you guys.    \\
127 - [LAUGHS]    \\
128 - Which is the theme of the whole show.    \\
129 - - There was a lot of action...\\
130 - - Mm.    \\
131 - ... and the story moved along at a brisk pace.    \\
132 - It was, overall... what's the word I'm looking for?    \\
133 - - Stupid?\\
134 - - So stupid.    \\
135 - Oh, remember the scene where Sheldon sleeps over and I have to sing him "Soft Kitty"?    \\
136 -  Soft kitty, warm kitty     \\
137 -  Little ball of fur     \\
138 -  Happy kitty...     \\
139 - Um...    \\
140 - Sleepy kitty.    \\
141 - -  Sleepy kitty... \\
142 - - No.    \\
143 - Start over.    \\
144 - Another favorite of mine is when Penny breaks her shoulder in-in the shower and Sheldon has to dress me.    \\
145 - Hey, you got to help me get my arm into the sleeve.    \\
146 - Okay.    \\
147 - Is that my arm?    \\
148 - When you think of The Big Bang Theory, you think of food.    \\
149 - Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli    \\
150 - - to be diced, not shredded?\\
151 - - Yes.    \\
152 - - Brown rice, not white?\\
153 - - Yes.    \\
154 - Did you stop at the Korean grocery    \\
155 - - and get the good hot mustard?\\
156 - - Yes.    \\
157 - Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?    \\
158 - - Yes.\\
159 - - Thank you.    \\
160 - You're welcome.    \\
161 - What took you so long?    \\
162 - - It's kind of what bonded these characters.\\
163 - - Yeah.    \\
164 - They eat. They sit down and eat together.    \\
165 - Quick poll: PS  or Xbox One?    \\
166 - - Raj?\\
167 - - Uh, Xbox One.    \\
168 - - Penny?\\
169 - - Huh?    \\
170 - - Leonard?\\
171 - - PS .    \\
172 - - Wolowitz?\\
173 - - Both great.    \\
174 - - Bernadette?\\
175 - - I like the Wii.    \\
176 - Thanks, Grandma.    \\
177 - Where do we start with guest stars?    \\
178 - We've had so many amazing people.    \\
179 - - John Ross Bowie as Kripke.\\
180 - - I'm making tea.    \\
181 - Would you like a cup?    \\
182 - Am I wearing a summer frock?    \\
183 - No, I don't want tea.    \\
184 - Brian Posehn.    \\
185 - - H-Him and his geology.\\
186 - - [CHUCKLING]    \\
187 - Thanks for coming to the Mineral and Rock Show with me.    \\
188 - GALECKI: Keith Carradine as your dad.    \\
189 - - That was a big deal for me.\\
190 - - CUOCO: Oh.    \\
191 - Katey Sagal as my mom.    \\
192 - - Miss Baranski. Oh.\\
193 - - Laurie Metcalf.    \\
194 - Let's all remember what it says in the Bible.    \\
195 - "He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty".    \\
196 - Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?    \\
197 - When God writes one, I will.    \\
198 - Adam West. Batman finally came to your party.    \\
199 - Happy birthday, Sherman.    \\
200 - GALECKI: James Earl Jones.    \\
201 - Let me guess.    \\
202 - You like Star Wars.    \\
203 - - CUOCO: Billy Bob Thornton.\\
204 - - Does Penny live here?    \\
205 - May I ask why?    \\
206 - Well, uh, I-I met her at my office.    \\
207 - She winked at me a-and, uh...    \\
208 - I, I-I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.    \\
209 - - Stephen Hawking, of course.\\
210 - - Oh.    \\
211 - You made an arithmetic mistake on page two.    \\
212 - It was quite the boner.    \\
213 - I had to actually say the line...    \\
214 - He's the wheelchair dude who invented time.    \\
215 - - He's right there watching the rehearsal.\\
216 - - Mm-hmm.    \\
217 - And I say this line, I just look at him like, "I'm so sorry".    \\
218 - He thought it was so funny.    \\
219 - - But he was right there.\\
220 - - I remember Simon being... very nervous to do his impersonation.    \\
221 - I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.    \\
222 - I suppose that could be    \\
223 - - considered offensive.\\
224 - - [LAUGHTER]    \\
225 - Speaking of Simon's impersonations.    \\
226 - Oh, his Pacino.    \\
227 - [GRUFF]: You're playing D&D.    \\
228 - You're playing D&D.    \\
229 - This whole apartment...    \\
230 - ... is playing D&D. Hah.    \\
231 - CUOCO: Shatner and Manganiello.    \\
232 - Bill Gates was great.    \\
233 - [VOICE BREAKING]: Ever since I was a little kid, I've looked up to you like... like a hero.    \\
234 - Would you like a tissue?    \\
235 - How about a hug?    \\
236 - How-how about a tissue?    \\
237 - CUOCO: Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk.    \\
238 - - We had a lot of Nobel Laureates on the show.\\
239 - - GALECKI: Three, at least. Buzz Aldrin.    \\
240 - I walked on the moon.    \\
241 - What have you done?    \\
242 - Carol Ann Susi, I have to give special tribute to.    \\
243 - She played, uh, the voice of Howard's mom.    \\
244 - - [BANG]\\
245 - - MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, I'm home!    \\
246 - MRS. WOLOWITZ: Sheldon!    \\
247 - MRS. WOLOWITZ: Does he like the pancakes?    \\
248 - He didn't try them yet!    \\
249 - Yes, Mrs. Wolowitz.    \\
250 - Although we never saw her, she was a big, big part of the show.    \\
251 - Well, I remember when word came down that she had passed, we gathered around here, everybody, and just told stories about...    \\
252 - - Carol Ann...\\
253 - - I mean, she... Yeah.    \\
254 - ... and cried a bit and laughed a lot.    \\
255 - And then, uh, executive producer Steve Molaro and I went to Props and asked them to print up this photo of her.    \\
256 - So she's been in every...    \\
257 - - Every episode.\\
258 - - Every episode.    \\
259 - Everyone loved her so much.    \\
260 - All right, come on in.    \\
261 - So, here we are in the most epic wardrobe room, I think, ever.    \\
262 - Everyone has their own wall.    \\
263 - We got Raj over here.    \\
264 - All his sweater vests.    \\
265 - We got Leonard on this side.    \\
266 - I think this robe might be one of the most famous robes in television.    \\
267 - - GALECKI: It's that and Archie Bunker's. Yeah.\\
268 - - CUOCO: Leonard's robe.    \\
269 - - Star Trek?\\
270 - - My chain mail.    \\
271 - - Star Trek.\\
272 - - I got it right.    \\
273 - [LAUGHING]: Well done.    \\
274 - I know Mr. Data isn't supposed to smile, but here it comes.    \\
275 - Come on, guys. Let's do this.    \\
276 - Yeah, I'm sweating my bald cap off.    \\
277 - [BEATBOXING]    \\
278 - - There... Who was in that? Raj.\\
279 - - Raj.    \\
280 - - For Halloween.\\
281 - - Raj was Aquaman.    \\
282 - GALECKI: Those are the Flashes, right?    \\
283 - Oh, my gosh.    \\
284 - See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.    \\
285 - We all have other costumes.\\
286 - We can change.    \\
287 - Or we could walk right behind each other all night.    \\
288 - It'll look like one person going really fast.    \\
289 - Oh, that was my cat outfit when I first kissed you.    \\
290 - - Halloween.\\
291 - - Oh, yeah.    \\
292 - The most iconic of all time are Wolowitz's belt buckles.    \\
293 - It's a light saber belt buckle.    \\
294 - [IMITATES LIGHT SABER WHOOSH]    \\
295 - [CHUCKLES] Wow.    \\
296 - I have one, too.    \\
297 - Check it out.    \\
298 - You can wear yours, and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.    \\
299 - [MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS]    \\
300 - Sheldon's zombie, when he popped up from the couch.    \\
301 - [SHOUTING]    \\
302 - My Valentine's Day outfit.    \\
303 - - Is that mine or yours?\\
304 - - That was... [LAUGHS]    \\
305 - BOTH: Happy Valentine's Day!    \\
306 - [BLOWING NOISEMAKER]    \\
307 - That's, obviously, Amy's incredible dress from their wedding.    \\
308 - [GASPS] Wow! You look like a pile of swans.    \\
309 - And Mark Hamill officiated.    \\
310 - Amy, do you take Sheldon for your lawful wedded husband?    \\
311 - I do.    \\
312 - [CRYING]: And, Sheldon, same thing.    \\
313 - Over here, the fencing outfit.    \\
314 - I was very excited by...    \\
315 - 'Cause I always wanted to take a fencing lesson.    \\
316 - One, two, three.    \\
317 - Switch again. One, two, three.    \\
318 - - [PHONE CHIMING]\\
319 - - Ehh!    \\
320 - Excuse me.    \\
321 - Can I call you back?    \\
322 - No, I'm-I'm teaching a class.    \\
323 - What about Bernadette? [LAUGHS]    \\
324 - - Oh, from the pageant, right? Yeah.\\
325 - - Yes.    \\
326 - I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California!    \\
327 - - Remember the Bavarian pretzel?\\
328 - - Bavarian pretzel.    \\
329 - Who could forget?    \\
330 - Ich bin ein Bavarian.    \\
331 - Und ich bin eine pretzel.    \\
332 - We're here in the prop room on the stage.    \\
333 - Uh, this was the Internet kissing...    \\
334 - - We made some memories in here...\\
335 - - that Wolowitz came up with in a very disturbing scene.    \\
336 - Whoa! You just bit my tongue!    \\
337 - I, like, nibbled. I was being playful.    \\
338 - Why do you have to make everything weird?    \\
339 - Sorry.    \\
340 - Better?    \\
341 - Oh, yeah.    \\
342 - That's the ring...    \\
343 - CUOCO: Lord of the Rings ring.    \\
344 - GALECKI: ... that we all held.    \\
345 - Ah.    \\
346 - Okay, everybody, and plié.    \\
347 - And relevé.    \\
348 - - Worst toy invention ever.\\
349 - - [LAUGHING]    \\
350 - Remote control Stephen Hawking!    \\
351 - The gift Penny gave to you and Sheldon,    \\
352 - - right? Ta-da!\\
353 - - Mm-hmm.    \\
354 - [GASPS] A vintage, mint, in-box    \\
355 -      Mego Star Trek transporter, with real transporter action. Hot darn!    \\
356 - And I got you a transporter, too!    \\
357 - Awesome!    \\
358 - We had a lot of robots on the show.    \\
359 - - We had Shelbot.\\
360 - - Yeah.    \\
361 - - Bazinga!\\
362 - - [HORNS BLARING]    \\
363 - - BattleBots.\\
364 - - Yeah.    \\
365 - No, I think I'm just gonna stay in tonight and do laundry.    \\
366 - [SCREAMING]    \\
367 - Robot Arm Wolowitz.    \\
368 - Oh, yeah, just like a real hand.    \\
369 - You slipped and fell into a robot hand?    \\
370 - Yes.    \\
371 - Penis-first?    \\
372 - Well, I think the most memorable prop that we have in here comes from season two.    \\
373 - The famous napkin that Penny gives to Sheldon she has Leonard Nimoy sign for him as a gift.    \\
374 - Sheldon freaks out and claims that he now has Leonard Nimoy's DNA.    \\
375 - Sorry the napkin's dirty.\\
376 - He wiped his mouth with it.    \\
377 - All I need is a healthy ovum, and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!    \\
378 - [AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING]    \\
379 - And which leads to one of my favorite moments that Shenny had over the course of the show, where he comes out and gives her, like, ten gifts, and then he hugs her.    \\
380 - - Entrée.\\
381 - - Comic Book store.    \\
382 - How many scenes have you had in here?    \\
383 - Oh, a lot more than you.    \\
384 - No, you were here for...    \\
385 - - "Scavenger Hunt".\\
386 - - I've been in here a bunch, yes.    \\
387 - One of my favorite episodes.\\
388 - I always say it.    \\
389 - - Melissa trying to hit me...\\
390 - - Punch you.    \\
391 - - ... in a way that looked realistic at all.\\
392 - - "Punch you".    \\
393 - Penny, I just wanted to say good luck,    \\
394 - - and I hope there's no hard feelings.\\
395 - - Hey, Romeo!    \\
396 - Repair your relationship on your own time!    \\
397 - The great Kevin Sussman.    \\
398 - What do you want for it?    \\
399 - Well, it's hard to put a price on something that's a copy of something that was on pay cable.    \\
400 - - I, like, adore him.\\
401 - - He is the comic book store.    \\
402 - [SPEAKING KLINGON]    \\
403 - Did that guy just say, "revenge is a dish best served cold" in Klingon?    \\
404 - I believe so.    \\
405 - What is wrong with him?    \\
406 - Everyone has a different theory.    \\
407 - It's not a dress-up party?    \\
408 - No.    \\
409 - Was it ever a dress-up party?    \\
410 - No.    \\
411 - Howard, didn't you tell me it was a dress-up party?    \\
412 - Yeah. [LAUGHS]    \\
413 - - Footprints on the Moon made their debut.\\
414 - -  Thor and Dr. Jones     \\
415 -  Thor and Dr. Jones     \\
416 - BOTH:  Thor and Dr. Jones     \\
417 -  One plays with lightning     \\
418 -  The other plays with bones.     \\
419 - - Come on.\\
420 - - You won't believe this.    \\
421 - When we have guests come, they immediately want to see what's down here. This is it.    \\
422 - - A lot of chewed gum here.\\
423 - - Yeah. [LAUGHS]    \\
424 - It's kind of like, how dogs mark trees,    \\
425 - - actors mark stages this way...\\
426 - - Yeah. with just chewed gum.    \\
427 - That's not true. We're just disgusting.    \\
428 - We're disgusting.    \\
429 - How about "bazinga"?    \\
430 - Bazinga.    \\
431 - Bazinga.    \\
432 - Bazinga.    \\
433 - Jim, you guys...    \\
434 - - They complained about that for days.\\
435 - - I hate to sound spoiled, but we got out of that, and we were just...    \\
436 - - coated in dirt.\\
437 - - Filth.    \\
438 - Yeah. They washed the balls the next day.    \\
439 - - That's key to being on set.\\
440 - - You got to wash the balls.    \\
441 - - Bazinga.\\
442 - - [LAUGHS]    \\
443 - DIRECTOR: And that's a cut.    \\
444 - [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]    \\
445 - [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]    \\
446 -     \\
447 - It's been an honor and joy for this cast to perform for you guys for    years.    \\
448 - Thank you so much.    \\
449 - [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]    \\
450 - Well, we've come to the end.    \\
451 - I don't really want to say good-bye.    \\
452 - [LAUGHS]    \\
453 - What you see here is not all that goes on.    \\
454 - And this crew has really helped make this show what it is.    \\
455 - GALECKI: Honestly, it could not be possible without the    -so crew and staff that work incredibly hard and get, much, much too little credit for it.    \\
456 - We thank you very, very much for all your hard work.    \\
457 - I really want to sit in that seat.    \\
458 - - Penny...\\
459 - - Yeah?    \\
460 - That's where I sit.    \\
461 - Sit next to me.    \\
462 - No, I sit there.    \\
463 - What's the difference?    \\
464 - - What's the difference?\\
465 - - Here we go.    \\
466 - In the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration.    \\
467 - In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze, created by opening windows there and there.    \\
468 - It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion.    \\
469 - I could go on, but I think I've made my point.    \\
470 - - Do it. Do it. He's not around.\\
471 - - All right.    \\
472 - - Nope. Can't do it.\\
473 - - [LAUGHS]    \\
474 - No.    \\
475 -  Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state     \\
476 -  Then nearly    billion years ago     \\
477 -  Expansion started... Wait!     \\
478 -  The Earth began to cool     \\
479 -  The autotrophs began to drool     \\
480 -  Neanderthals developed tools     \\
481 -  We built a wall, we built the pyramids     \\
482 -  Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery     \\
483 -  That all started with a big bang.
