\section {Malcolm in the Middle Season 01}
\subsection {Episode 01: Pilot}
1 - This is the world--\\
2 - 196 million square miles.\\
3 - If I covered 100 square miles an hour\\
4 - every hour for the rest of my life\\
5 - I'd still only see half of it.\\
6 - This is the left nostril of my brother Reese.\\
7 - It squeaks all night long.\\
8 - These are the freezing cold feet\\
9 - of my little brother... Dewey.\\
10 - This is my oldest brother Francis.\\
11 - He's the one I really like\\
12 - so, of course, he got sent to military school.\\
13 - My name is Malcolm.\\
14 - You want to know what the best thing\\
15 - about childhood is?\\
16 - At some point, it stops.\\
17 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
18 -     I don't know    \\
19 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 -     It's your thing    \\
27 -     Do what you wanna do...    \\
28 - Malcolm, Reese, Dewey, get in here!\\
29 -     I can't tell you who to sock it to    \\
30 -     Who to sock it to...    \\
31 - No, stop! I'm not touching...\\
32 - There's only two toaster waffles.\\
33 - One of you has to have cereal.\\
34 - It's mine!\\
35 - Come on!\\
36 - Give it!\\
37 - You cheated!\\
38 - Give it! Give it!\\
39 - Huh, look at this.\\
40 - They're sending an unmanned probe to Venus\\
41 - and letting a bunch of schoolchildren name it.\\
42 - Well, that's going to end badly.\\
43 - They do this every month.\\
44 - He has sensitive skin.\\
45 - The hair gets itchy under his clothes.\\
46 - It always seems like such a shame\\
47 - to just dump this in the trash.\\
48 - Maybe birds would like to make nests with it\\
49 - or, I don't know, maybe you boys could use it for school projects.\\
50 - Arms up.\\
51 - Malcolm, come right home from school.\\
52 - Dude.\\
53 - Malcolm, you come right home from school today.\\
54 - I made a play date for you with Stevie Kenarban\\
55 - and you have to take a bath.\\
56 - What? Mom, no!\\
57 - Malcolm has a play date?!\\
58 - Shut up, Reese!\\
59 - With Stevie "The Wheelie" Kenarban?\\
60 - Oh, man!\\
61 - Why is playing a problem for you?\\
62 - First off,\\
63 - I don't even know Stevie. I saw his mother\\
64 - at the grocery story. She said you boys ate lunch together.\\
65 - One time.\\
66 - He rolled his wheelchair over next to me.\\
67 - It's not like I couldn't say, "go away."\\
68 - He's not even in my class.\\
69 - He's in the Krelboyne class\\
70 - in the trailer next to tetherball.\\
71 - You listen to me, young man.\\
72 - That one lunch obviously meant a lot to Stevie.\\
73 - He's a human being with human feelings.\\
74 - Now, you are going to be friends with that crippled boy\\
75 - and you are going to like it. Understood?\\
76 - Yes, ma'am. Understood.\\
77 - If I give up now, I won't get the lecture.\\
78 - You kids... Dang.\\
79 - You just take your legs for granted, you know?\\
80 - Like nothing could ever happen to them. Well, let me tell you something.\\
81 - That is just wishful thinking.\\
82 - There's meningitis. There are car accidents.\\
83 - I could be giving you a spanking\\
84 - and accidentally snap your spinal cord.\\
85 - Every day is a lottery\\
86 - and first prize is that you don't have to scoot\\
87 - yourself around town on a skateboard with your hands.\\
88 - You think about that.\\
89 - I don't take my legs for granted, Mom.\\
90 - I know, honey, you're a good boy.\\
91 - Stop playing with yourself.\\
92 - Go on, just go.\\
93 - No, wait, wait, wait.\\
94 - Okay, okay, okay, I ran out of ham.\\
95 - One of you has to have egg salad, okay?\\
96 - And don't ditch your little brother.\\
97 - I don't want him getting kidnapped.\\
98 - Yeah, Mom, that would be terrible.\\
99 - It's your turn to walk with him.\\
100 - I walked him yesterday and the day before.\\
101 - I walked with him when he wet his pants.\\
102 - Okay.\\
103 - Mom said to hold hands.\\
104 - She did not say to hold hands, Dewey.\\
105 - I'm not holding hands.\\
106 - Come on, hold hands. Please?\\
107 - No! You're in the first grade.\\
108 - You're too big for that.\\
109 - Look, I'm walking right next to you.\\
110 - You'll be fine.\\
111 - Damn it! This is why everyone teases you.\\
112 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
113 - Hey, Richard.\\
114 - So my mom was telling my dad last night\\
115 - about your brother.\\
116 - She said he's in jail.\\
117 - He's not in jail.\\
118 - He's at Marlin Academy.\\
119 - It's, like, one of the best private schools in the country\\
120 - and it's totally unfair.\\
121 - Everyone acts like Francis is just this big troublemaker\\
122 - and he's not.\\
123 - Dad, I know what you're going to say\\
124 - and believe me, I totally agree with you.\\
125 - There is no excuse for what I did.\\
126 - It was idiotic, immature, totally reckless\\
127 - and I'm really sorry.\\
128 - I'm just... I'm hoping against hope\\
129 - that you will give me another chance, which, I admit\\
130 - I don't deserve\\
131 - but if you could just find it in your heart\\
132 - to forgive me\\
133 - I know I could earn your trust back.\\
134 - It's not like it was even our car.\\
135 - Spath, Spath, Spath!\\
136 - Spath: All right,\\
137 - Here's how it works.\\
138 - You can beg for mercy on your belly\\
139 - lick the bottom of my shoes\\
140 - or take a beating.\\
141 - You must pick at least two\\
142 - but... but-but, if you pick three\\
143 - you get a pass for the next two weeks.\\
144 - All right?\\
145 - Now, that's your best value.\\
146 - Dave Spath.\\
147 - He never gets sent anywhere.\\
148 - What do you do if he catches you?\\
149 - Roll in a ball.\\
150 - What if he starts kicking you?\\
151 - Stay in a ball.\\
152 - Okay. Come on.\\
153 - Wait.\\
154 - Never mind.\\
155 - Those of you finished with your tempera paints\\
156 - may bring your work up here\\
157 - and start on your charcoal still lifes.\\
158 - You may take two pieces of fruit only\\
159 - and please be careful with them.\\
160 - I bought them with my own money.\\
161 - My own money.\\
162 - God, Malcolm, that's so good.\\
163 - Oh, Malcolm, this is wonderful.\\
164 - The perspective is good.\\
165 - The composition is clean\\
166 - and it even shows signs of actual technique.\\
167 - I have to say this is the high point of my day.\\
168 - How's that for sad?\\
169 - Are you okay?\\
170 - Um, yeah, I'm fine.\\
171 - Malcolm.\\
172 - What?\\
173 - They need to see you in the office.\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - I think they mean right now.\\
176 - Okay.\\
177 - Get up, Malcolm.\\
178 - Hi. I'm Caroline.\\
179 - Want to have a seat?\\
180 - Are you Malcolm?\\
181 - Yes, and I didn't do anything.\\
182 - You're not in trouble, Malcolm.\\
183 - You're here 'cause some of your teachers\\
184 - think you're, um... you know what?\\
185 - I just want to play some games with you.\\
186 - Okay? Puzzles, stuff like that. Why?\\
187 - Boy, oh, boy\\
188 - you are a suspicious little dickens, aren't you?\\
189 - Okay. Now, you can look at this picture for 60 seconds\\
190 - and I want you to tell me\\
191 - everything that's wrong with it, okay?\\
192 - The man only has four fingers.\\
193 - Right, but this time\\
194 - I want you to take your time and really look...\\
195 - The car shadow's going the wrong way,\\
196 - the steering wheel's on the wrong side,\\
197 - there's no brake pedal,\\
198 - the words in the mirror should be backwards,\\
199 - the guy's watch wouldn't say 12:00\\
200 - if he's looking at a sunset\\
201 - and I have red paint on my ass.\\
202 - That's right.\\
203 - Red paint all over my ass!\\
204 -     I'm coming home, I've done my time...    \\
205 - These are good cookies.\\
206 - Yeah... they're good.\\
207 -     If you received my letter telling you...    \\
208 - So what can you do?\\
209 - I mean, what do you want to do?\\
210 - I know... a joke.\\
211 - Yeah? Okay.\\
212 - A guy...\\
213 - goes into...\\
214 - a bar...\\
215 - and he...\\
216 - has a... frog\\
217 - on his...\\
218 - Frog on his head.\\
219 - And the... bartender...\\
220 - Wait, I screwed up.\\
221 - A frog...\\
222 - goes into... a bar.\\
223 - You want to watch TV?\\
224 - Can't. Not allowed.\\
225 - What? You mean, ever?\\
226 - Mom says...\\
227 - TV makes you...\\
228 - stupid.\\
229 - No, TV makes you normal.\\
230 - How can they do that?\\
231 - He's in a wheelchair.\\
232 - So what do you do all day, homework?\\
233 - Mostly... read... comics.\\
234 - You have comic books?\\
235 - Whoa!\\
236 - You really have Youngblood, number one?\\
237 - Want to... read it?\\
238 - No way. I'd wreck it.\\
239 - Oh... did you read the last Savage Dragon\\
240 - when they split him in two?\\
241 - Yeah. Brilliant.\\
242 - I like how he never has to learn a lesson or anything.\\
243 - He just gets to pound on everyone.\\
244 - You're under galactic arrest.\\
245 - Think again, space flatfoot.\\
246 - You cannot escape.\\
247 - Saturday morning is the only thing\\
248 - my family does better than anyone else.\\
249 - Damn!\\
250 - You boys, you keep this house clean\\
251 - till your dad comes home.\\
252 - Two of you can have slices of pizza for lunch.\\
253 - The other one can have...\\
254 - I don't know. I think they're peas.\\
255 - Somebody get that.\\
256 - Not it. Not it.\\
257 - Hello.\\
258 - Young master Malcolm.\\
259 - Francis, hi.\\
260 - Hey, man,\\
261 - I wrote you guys a really long letter yesterday,\\
262 - but, listen, they only gave me, like, three minutes,\\
263 - so would you put the special prosecutor on?\\
264 - Mom, it's Francis.\\
265 - Hey, Francis, how's school?\\
266 - Oh, couldn't be better, Mom.\\
267 - My new roommate showed me how to kill mice\\
268 - with a hammer yesterday, so, you know, between that\\
269 - and the general atmosphere of simmering homoeroticism,\\
270 - I think I'm really starting to turn around.\\
271 - Honey, it's only until summer.\\
272 - Come on, push it!\\
273 - Give it up, prom date.\\
274 - Yeah, listen, um... I know I shouldn't ask,\\
275 - but would you be able\\
276 - to send me my allowance, like, a couple weeks early\\
277 - 'cause I kind of need some...?\\
278 - Oh, my God! Are you smoking?\\
279 - What? I can hear you smoking.\\
280 - You're smoking, aren't you?\\
281 - Mom, I'm not smoking. Geez.\\
282 - After seeing the anguish\\
283 - your father and I went through to quit,\\
284 - didn't any of that register with you?\\
285 - Okay, listen.\\
286 - I'll talk to your dad.\\
287 - Maybe we can send you part of it.\\
288 - Honey, I have to go.\\
289 - I'm late for work.\\
290 - I'll call you later.\\
291 - Okay, thanks, Mom. I love you.\\
292 - Oh... I love you.\\
293 - Somebody get the door!\\
294 - I'm not getting it. You get it, butt-munch.\\
295 - Shut up. You shut up.\\
296 - No, you shut up! Make me!\\
297 - I'll make you right now!\\
298 - You'd better not be fighting in there, Reese, Malcolm.\\
299 - Not my face!\\
300 - I said you'd better not be fighting in...\\
301 - For crying out loud.\\
302 - Reese! Malcolm!\\
303 - Yes. Can I help you?\\
304 - Oh. My good... um, hi.\\
305 - Hel... hello. I'm....\\
306 - Are you...? I'm... Caroline Miller\\
307 - from Malcolm's school.\\
308 - I sent you some letters\\
309 - and left some messages on your answering machine.\\
310 - Okay, fine. You caught me. What do you want?\\
311 - Um... well, it's been three weeks\\
312 - and you haven't responded, and it's really important,\\
313 - I mean, well, for Malcolm's sake\\
314 - that the parents be as involved in...\\
315 - So, what, you're here to insult my parenting skills?\\
316 - No. I'm sure you're a terrific parent.\\
317 - I'm here because I think\\
318 - that there is a tremendous opportunity for...\\
319 - Could you, you know, maybe put a top on?\\
320 - They're just boobs, lady.\\
321 - You see them in a mirror every morning.\\
322 - And I'm sure yours are a lot nicer than mine.\\
323 - That's actually not... You know what?\\
324 - I'm gonna tell you something else.\\
325 - The reason I didn't respond\\
326 - is because it is a load of crap. What?\\
327 - You are not going to stick my Malcolm\\
328 - in some special ed class.\\
329 - What is it with you people?\\
330 - Why do you feel you have to label everybody?\\
331 - Malcolm may be a little strange,\\
332 - and, I know, I know, he never shuts up,\\
333 - but he is not disturbed.\\
334 - You know, he is a good boy...\\
335 - Please!\\
336 - You know what? You don't understand at all, okay?\\
337 - So if I could just come in for a minute,\\
338 - I could explain everything, okay?\\
339 - Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
340 - It's good, hon.\\
341 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
342 - There's something we have to talk about.\\
343 - I thought we weren't going to mention Aunt Helen\\
344 - till after the biopsy. It's not that.\\
345 - It's about Malcolm. I didn't do it.\\
346 - Yes, he did. I saw him.\\
347 - A teacher from school came by\\
348 - and she ran some tests with Malcolm.\\
349 - He has an IQ of 165.\\
350 - Who?\\
351 - Malcolm. He's a genius.\\
352 - He's going to a special class.\\
353 - What? Malcolm's special?\\
354 - Where do you think that came from?\\
355 - They have a special program for gifted children.\\
356 - They have advanced textbooks and devoted teachers\\
357 - and all sorts of good things they don't want to waste\\
358 - on normal kids. You start on Monday.\\
359 - You're going to put him in the Krelboyne class?\\
360 - Mom, no! I don't want to!\\
361 - What are you talking about?\\
362 - Of course you want to.\\
363 - No. I want to stay in my own class.\\
364 - I don't want to be a Krelboyne.\\
365 - Mom, seriously, Krelboynes get their butts kicked.\\
366 - Just stop one minute.\\
367 - There's nothing wrong with being smart.\\
368 - And there's nothing wrong with being cut from the herd.\\
369 - It makes you the one buffalo that isn't there\\
370 - when the Indians run the rest of them off the cliff.\\
371 - Huh?\\
372 - Mom, this isn't fair!\\
373 - If I don't want to go, why do I have to?\\
374 - Because it's not just up to you.\\
375 - We have to do what's best for you.\\
376 - Mom, please! Don't make me go!\\
377 - Please!\\
378 - Malcolm, calm down. But it isn't fair!\\
379 - That's right. It isn't fair.\\
380 - It's the first time anyone in this family\\
381 - has ever been given an edge,\\
382 - and you are not going to waste it.\\
383 - Dad? Honey?\\
384 - Well... look, honey...\\
385 - Malcolm, you see...\\
386 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
387 - How come there's never any iced tea in this pitcher?\\
388 - I make a fresh batch every morning;\\
389 - it's gone by the time I get home.\\
390 - I want a better family!\\
391 - Malcolm...\\
392 - Look at that.\\
393 - Gone.\\
394 - I don't want to go to a special class.\\
395 - People think I'm weird enough already.\\
396 - I know.\\
397 - I like where I am. I want to stay.\\
398 - Sweetie, life does not give you\\
399 - a lot of chances to move up, even if you deserve it.\\
400 - Look at your dad and me.\\
401 - Malcolm, I'm proud of you.\\
402 - You boys are so lucky.\\
403 - You have so many gifts that other kids don't have.\\
404 - And I just don't mean Stevie Kenarban, either.\\
405 - I mean, look at those Parker boys across the street.\\
406 - They may be healthy, but honest to God,\\
407 - those are the ugliest little boys ever born.\\
408 - They look like boiled beets, don't you think?\\
409 - And those Henderson kids?\\
410 - That electrocuted their dog\\
411 - when they were trying to get free cable.\\
412 - How smart can they be?\\
413 - Just remember,\\
414 - any kid who makes fun of you is a creepy little loser\\
415 - who'll end up working in a car wash.\\
416 - This shouldn't make me feel better, but it does.\\
417 - You'll be all right, sweetie.\\
418 - If you don't make a big deal out of this,\\
419 - nobody else will either.\\
420 - And I just can't say enough\\
421 - about how proud we should all be of Malcolm\\
422 - for getting into the gifted program.\\
423 - Now, Malcolm may not look different than the rest of us,\\
424 - but he is.\\
425 - Very different.\\
426 - In his brain.\\
427 - And I think we should recognize him for that.\\
428 - Bye.\\
429 - All righty,\\
430 - today we are starting a new section\\
431 - on the Peloponnesian War,\\
432 - which I know you are all going to love.\\
433 - Malcolm?\\
434 - Are you okay?\\
435 - Uh, yeah. Fine.\\
436 - All right.\\
437 - Excuse me.\\
438 - Stop staring at me!\\
439 - Why do they keep doing that?\\
440 - You're new. Oh, great.\\
441 - So I'm the freak of the freak show?\\
442 - Just... chill out.\\
443 - Don't tell me to chill out.\\
444 - You chill out.\\
445 - Nobody can live like this.\\
446 - I'm okay. Oh, sure.\\
447 - You're okay because it doesn't make any difference to you.\\
448 - You've always been a freak.\\
449 - I used to be normal.\\
450 - Wait. Who just said that?\\
451 - You're going to take that the wrong way, aren't you?\\
452 - You...\\
453 - suck.\\
454 - It's so cool!\\
455 - Around here, being smart is exactly like being radioactive.\\
456 - I can't believe I'm doing this.\\
457 - Stevie?\\
458 - What?\\
459 - Look,\\
460 - I...\\
461 - Score!\\
462 - Hey, Spath!\\
463 - Why don't you stop being such a butt-wipe?!\\
464 - Ooh.\\
465 - What'd you call me?\\
466 - You heard me!\\
467 - I don't care anymore!\\
468 - I just don't care, Spath, okay?\\
469 - Alls you ever do is make everybody miserable!\\
470 - Except for your little monkey-slaves over there.\\
471 - Who, by the way,\\
472 - only pretend to like you.\\
473 - They hate you as much as everyone else does!\\
474 - And you're just too busy being mean and stupid\\
475 - to ever figure it out!\\
476 - I keep trying to run, but my legs won't work.\\
477 - Mom was right, they are important.\\
478 - Wow.\\
479 - I don't know about you,\\
480 - but the Krelboyne really hurt my feelings.\\
481 - Hey...\\
482 - Go away, Stevie.\\
483 - It's good you two are friends.\\
484 - He won't mind sharing his wheelchair.\\
485 - Okay, this is where something good happens, finally.\\
486 - So we're going to slow down\\
487 - and make it last as long as possible.\\
488 -     The possible dream    \\
489 -     Finale of scenes    \\
490 -     The moment that some call eternal    \\
491 -     That some call insane.    \\
492 - Dude, you hit a cripple.\\
493 - I didn't mean to... I wasn't trying...\\
494 - Stevie, I'm sorry!\\
495 - Ow...\\
496 - Aah...\\
497 - Ow!\\
498 - What's your problem?\\
499 - I mean, he's in a wheelchair and he has glasses.\\
500 - Do you know how bad that looks?\\
501 - What's your problem?\\
502 -     I've seen better days    \\
503 -     I've been a star of many...    \\
504 - So then, the principal comes out\\
505 - and everyone's all talking at once.\\
506 - So the story he puts together\\
507 - is that Spath attacks Stevie for his lunch,\\
508 - and I'm like this hero that stepped in to defend him.\\
509 - It was beautiful.\\
510 - Okay, it wasn't funny when Spath started crying.\\
511 - No, wait, it was.\\
512 - Dad's hair... ugh.\\
513 - Yeah, I know. It's gross.\\
514 - But, hey, if a bunch of birds\\
515 - can make the best out of what they get,\\
516 - - then so can I. - Malcolm?\\
517 - Like having to go to special class.\\
518 - I can make it work out, right?\\
519 - Malcolm?\\
520 - Not now!\\
521 - Or my family.\\
522 - We're not the greatest family in the world,\\
523 - but we can get better.\\
524 - I mean, it's not impossible.\\
525 - Malcolm?\\
526 - What?!\\
527 - Can I get out?\\
528 - No! Stop asking!\\
529 - So, basically, I think everything's going to be okay.\\
530 - A bug went up my nose.\\
531 - So what do you want me to do about it?

1 - What'd you do? What?\\
2 - Don't give me that. What'd you do?\\
3 - Nothing.\\
4 - Mom, I'm trying to study.\\
5 - Oh.\\
6 - Then I'm sure you don't mind if I, uh...\\
7 - took a look in here.\\
8 - Mom, I'm telling you.\\
9 - We didn't do anything.\\

18 - Either she's losing her touch, or we're getting better.\\
19 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
20 -     I don't know    \\

26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     Life is unfair.    \\
29 - The good thing about being smart\\
30 - is I never have to look up any phone numbers.\\
31 - The bad thing is no one else in the family\\
32 - ever bothers to remember anything.\\
33 - Hey, Francis, you told me to remind you\\
34 - about Mom and Dad's anniversary.\\
35 - Ah, great.\\
36 - When is that? Today.\\
37 - Dude, you're supposed to remind me before\\
38 - so that I can get them something.\\
39 - That's okay.\\
40 - We'll put your name on our gift.\\
41 - Cool. Thanks, man.\\

55 - on a special day.\\
56 - No, I mean, really, you shouldn't have.\\
57 - Aren't only husbands supposed to give you gifts?\\
58 - Fine, throw it in the trash, then.\\
59 - H-H-Hold on.\\
60 - Well, let's see what it is first.\\
61 - Oh, look at...\\

70 - but it was worth it.\\
71 - Oh, I've been fantasizing about this night forever.\\
72 -        \\
73 -        \\
74 - Craig?\\

82 - Are you boys almost finished wrapping our present?!\\
83 - I have to meet your father at the restaurant in ten minutes!\\
84 - More paper.\\
85 - I get to do the bow.\\
86 - Why'd she give you the money to buy the gift?\\
87 - Because she didn't want another karate video.\\
88 - It's "ka-ra-tay."\\
89 - I get to do the bow.\\
90 - What'd we get them anyway?\\
91 - Picture frame.\\
92 - Brownnoser.\\
93 - I get to do the bow.\\
94 - We're not finished yet.\\
95 - Yeah, but I get to do the bow.\\
96 - Finished.\\
97 - Finally.\\
98 - No! I was supposed to do the bow.\\
99 - Well, you should have said something.\\
100 - I'm telling.\\
101 - Mom...!\\
102 - No...!\\
103 - Fire?\\
104 - Fire?\\
105 - Fire?! Mom! What's...?\\
106 - This is the most stupid, irresponsible,\\
107 - dangerous thing you have ever done!\\
108 - Is this what you want?!\\
109 - Where we have to identify your charred little bodies\\
110 - through their dental records?\\
111 - I want a straight answer.\\
112 - Who did this?!\\
113 - Malcolm did it! Reese did it!\\
114 - I didn't do it! I didn't do it!\\
115 - We're going to the dentist?\\
116 - Who?\\
117 - I don't like that one anyway.\\
118 - No. No. Not that one.\\
119 -     They turn me down, they turn me down    \\
120 -     They turn, they turn, they turn, they turn    \\
121 -     They, they, they, they, they...    \\
122 - Who?\\
123 - It wasn't me. It was him. It was him, it was him.\\
124 - Okay. Into the hallway.\\
125 - I think I'm gonna puke.\\
126 - Yeah? Well, that's gonna be the highlight of your evening,\\
127 - because nobody is going anywhere till one of you tells me who.\\
128 - And everything's all set up?\\
129 - I believe so, sir.\\
130 - Table seven? Chateau Brut '87?\\
131 - Hors d'oeuvres medley?\\
132 - Yes, sir.\\
133 - Ooh, geez.\\
134 - One more thing.\\
135 - I almost forgot.\\
136 - See, uh, my wife always orders lobster,\\
137 - so could you have the chef slip this\\
138 - on the lobster's claw just before you serve it?\\
139 - She gets such a kick out of stuff like that.\\
140 - And so do I, for that matter.\\
141 - Not a problem, sir.\\
142 - The violinist has our song?\\
143 - He received the sheet music this morning.\\
144 - Good. Good, good, good, good.\\
145 - You would be surprised how many times\\
146 - I've heard "Tears of a Clown" just butchered.\\
147 - Tell her. You tell her.\\
148 - Who?\\
149 - Okay, okay, closer to the wall!\\
150 - Wait, Mom, seriously, it reeks over here.\\
151 - I can't help it.\\
152 - Okay, into the TV room.\\
153 - Let's go.\\
154 -     Come on...    \\
155 -     Come on    \\
156 -     Come on...    \\
157 -     Come on    \\
158 -     Come on, come on    \\
159 -     Come on...    \\
160 - I'll give you $5\\
161 - if you tell Mom you did it. You tell her.\\
162 - You did it, 'cause I didn't do it.\\
163 - I really didn't.\\
164 - What are you eating?\\
165 - Nothing. Why don't you guys shut up\\
166 - so I can think of something?\\
167 - What's there to think of?\\
168 - There's nothing we can do.\\
169 - I've never seen Mom so mad.\\
170 - Me, either.\\
171 - Reese is right.\\
172 - We're out of our league.\\
173 - There's only one person\\
174 - who ever had Mom this mad at them and survived.\\
175 - Hello.\\
176 - And she has your heads where? Under the couch.\\
177 - All because Reese won't admit he did it.\\
178 - You admit it. I didn't do it.\\
179 - Neither did I. Liar. Whoa, wh-whoa.\\
180 - Chill. You are not gonna get anywhere\\
181 - fighting with each other.\\
182 - Now, first of all, you all burned the dress.\\
183 - I didn't.\\
184 - Hey, you all did it.\\
185 - You have to stay together.\\
186 - You have to stay united.\\
187 - United against who?\\
188 - My mom. Nice.\\
189 - Okay, now, no one broke so far,\\
190 - so you should be proud of yourselves.\\
191 - Did she do the toy thing yet? Yep.\\
192 - - Spinning? - Uh-uh.\\
193 - Okay, good.\\
194 - I think I know where she's going.\\
195 - Separate interviews.\\
196 - Listen, when she gets you alone,\\
197 - she's going to pretend she's on your side.\\
198 - She's not.\\
199 - Go ahead.\\
200 - It's a name brand.\\
201 - I'm not mad at you.\\
202 - I know you didn't do this.\\
203 - You're a good boy.\\
204 - But I want you to help me find out who did.\\
205 - This is serious.\\
206 - One of your brothers could have burned the house down.\\
207 - And for that, he will be severely punished.\\
208 - But the one who helps me will be a very happy boy.\\
209 - And I want that to be you.\\
210 - 'Cause you've always been the best one.\\
211 - You've always been the best one.\\
212 - You have always been the best one.\\
213 - Mom, honestly, I don't know who did it.\\
214 - I don't know. Don't know.\\
215 - Well, I guess you boys think\\
216 - you've got your old mom over a barrel, huh?\\
217 - Well, we'll just see about that.\\
218 - If you boys want to play,\\
219 - we can play all night long.\\
220 - Sir? Mmm.\\
221 - Oh.\\
222 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
223 - Oh, can I have another vodka martini, please?\\
224 - Very good.\\
225 - This time, let's go olive, onion, olive.\\
226 - Whatever.\\
227 - W-What's that? I can't hear you.\\
228 - She's killing us!\\
229 -     Nice is good, mean is bad    \\
230 -     Don't be mean, 'cause mean is bad    \\
231 -     Nice is better than mean    \\
232 -     Hugs are good, thugs are bad    \\
233 -     Don't be a thug...     Why does she have to ruin everything I love?!\\
234 - Francis, I'm just going to tell her I did it.\\
235 - I know it wasn't me, but anything is better than this!\\
236 - Oh, God.\\
237 - That is bad.\\
238 - They tried that psych-ops stuff on Noriega.\\
239 - They said that by the end,\\
240 - he wanted to cut his own ears off.\\
241 - Malcolm, you cannot crack now.\\
242 - She will own you for the rest of your life.\\
243 - Now, listen to me, Malcolm.\\
244 - You have to do exactly what I say.\\
245 -     Nice is good, mean is bad    \\
246 -     Don't be mean, 'cause mean is bad    \\
247 -     Nice is better than mean    \\
248 -     Hugs are good, thugs are bad    \\
249 -     Don't be a thug, 'cause thugs are bad    \\
250 -     Hugs are better than thugs    \\
251 -     Smart is good...     Did you see that?\\
252 - Hey! Francis is a genius!\\
253 - Come on, sing louder!\\
254 -     Nice is good, mean is bad    \\
255 -     Don't be mean, 'cause mean is bad...    \\
256 - Oh, this is so cute!\\
257 - Oh, your grandmother and all your friends\\
258 - are just going to love this\\
259 - at your next birthday party.\\
260 - You're kidding me.\\
261 - Okay, just hang in there.\\
262 - Give me a minute to think.\\
263 - Damn, she's good.\\
264 - Did they crack?\\
265 - Nah, Dewey faked a stomach cramp,\\
266 - bought 'em some time. Good man.\\
267 - Man, if we would have had your mom in 'Nam,\\
268 - there'd be a McDonald's in Hanoi Square right now.\\
269 - Dude, there is a McDonald's in Hanoi Square.\\
270 - All right.\\
271 - Franklin, I'm ready to order.\\
272 - Are you sure, sir?\\
273 - Mm-hmm. See, in our family, we have a saying.\\
274 - "After an hour, eat without her.\\
275 - If it's any longer, something's wronger."\\
276 - Very catchy, sir.\\
277 - Well, when life gives you lemons,\\
278 - make lemonade, Franklin.\\
279 - Do you have any lemonade?\\
280 - No, sir. Oh.\\
281 - You have lemons? Yes, sir.\\
282 - Well, throw one in another martini\\
283 - and let's hear those specials.\\
284 - What's she doing?\\
285 - Can't tell.\\
286 - Maybe she left.\\
287 - Yeah, I'm sure she's gone out to buy us all presents.\\
288 - Hooray.\\
289 - Man, it's just too quiet out there.\\
290 - It's driving me crazy.\\
291 - Maybe we should sing some more.\\
292 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
293 - I wonder how many holes are up in those tiles.\\
294 - 186,480.\\
295 - You counted all those?\\
296 - No, you just count one tile's holes, across and down,\\
297 - multiply it, then multiply it again by the number of tiles.\\
298 - You're doing that more and more.\\
299 - Doing what?\\
300 - That brain thing.\\
301 - Are you just going to keep getting smarter and weirder?\\
302 - I don't know.\\
303 - Well, can you tone it down a little bit?\\
304 - 'Cause I can't keep up with all these butt-kickings.\\
305 - What are you talking about?\\
306 - Well, at least twice a day I have to whoop-ass\\
307 - on some kid calling you a weirdo.\\
308 - Honestly, it's exhausting.\\
309 - You beat up people 'cause they call me a weirdo?\\
310 - Well, the last kid, he was a freak anyways.\\
311 - He was in no position to throw out names.\\
312 - Thanks. For what?\\
313 - Nothing.\\
314 - Hey.\\
315 - What am I thinking right now?\\
316 - I'm smart; I'm not psychic.\\
317 - Can you understand what dogs are saying?\\
318 - No.\\
319 - I can.\\
320 - Oh, boys.\\
321 - I don't know who put you up to this sticking-together garbage,\\
322 - but I don't like it.\\
323 - Therefore, you have forced me to do something terrible.\\
324 - Say good-bye to a cherished family member.\\
325 - - Who?! - No!\\
326 - No! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.\\
327 - Don't you dare.\\
328 - And don't move a muscle.\\
329 - Hi, Lois.\\
330 - Look, Ed, uh, it's 9:00.\\
331 - I'm a little busy right now.\\
332 - Well, you see, there's the problem.\\
333 - It's 9:00 at night, and I keep hearing screaming.\\
334 - Now, this didn't sound like your normal screaming.\\
335 - It-it was more like killing-screaming.\\
336 - I'm not one to complain...\\
337 - That's why we like you.\\
338 - In your room...\\
339 - now.\\
340 - Nice place you got here.\\
341 - Thank you, sir.\\
342 - I like to create an atmosphere.\\
343 - Did you enjoy your meal, sir?\\
344 - Well, if you can call four olives, two onions\\
345 - and a whole lot of alcohol a meal,\\
346 - then, yes.\\
347 - Very good, sir.\\
348 - Uh...\\
349 - What have you got in the cologne department?\\
350 - Um, were you looking for anything in particular?\\
351 - Well, I've been thinking about a signature scent. Uh-huh.\\
352 - You see, I-I'd like to leave a room and have people say,\\
353 - "Boy, smells like Hal in here."\\
354 - Mmm?\\
355 - But in a nice way. Yeah. Right.\\
356 - Uh, let's see... you...\\
357 - You strike me as a...\\
358 - sandalwood.\\
359 - Sandalwood, huh?\\
360 - Sandalwood.\\
361 - Let's give it a smell-see, shall we?\\
362 - Eh?\\
363 - Yes.\\
364 - That's quite nice.\\
365 - Hit me.\\
366 - Here we go.\\
367 - Oh, that's... that is quite nice.\\
368 - Ooh!\\
369 - You do a service to your craft, sir.\\
370 - This man is a genius.\\
371 - Snooty bastard.\\
372 - You'd think this place would be the great equalizer, huh?\\
373 - You know, even a king looks like a fool\\
374 - when he's answering nature's call, am I right?\\
375 - Of course I'm right.\\
376 - Well, it's been a pleasure.\\
377 - Oh.\\
378 - Sorry.\\
379 - Have a good evening.\\
380 - Uh, sir?\\
381 - Yes.\\
382 - Thank you for making eye contact with me.\\
383 - Boys, I just, I don't know what to do anymore.\\
384 - I don't want to punish anyone.\\
385 - All I want is the truth.\\
386 - I don't know how things got this far,\\
387 - but I just want it to stop.\\
388 - Nah, they'll never buy it.\\
389 - Oh, my God, Hal.\\
390 - They saved the TV.\\
391 - Beautiful work, beautiful!\\
392 - You have her exactly where you want her-- totally crazy.\\
393 - Now it's time to take the offensive.\\
394 - The offensive?\\
395 - Exactly. She won't...\\
396 - Wait a minute.\\
397 - Did you hear breathing?\\
398 - What?\\
399 - Mom?\\
400 - Malcolm.\\
401 - Would you hang up the phone, please?\\
402 - Hi, Mom.\\
403 - Happy anniversary.\\
404 - Not good. Not good.\\
405 - What is it? What?!\\
406 - Mom! Phone!\\
407 - Oh! Oh, man. Oh, man.\\
408 - We're gonna die!\\
409 - That's it.\\
410 - I got to run away. Oh. Wait!\\
411 - We can get out of this.\\
412 - You have to use that brain of yours.\\
413 - Think.\\
414 - Think!\\
415 - All I can think about\\
416 - is how hard he's twisting my nipple.\\
417 - Ow!\\
418 - Okay.\\
419 - Think. Think.\\
420 - I got it.\\
421 - Mmm, here it is.\\
422 - That's our song.\\
423 - Not our song. No, no, not...\\
424 - Can I have...?\\
425 - Another one...\\
426 - I cannot believe you, Francis.\\
427 - You think you are so clever\\
428 - turning them against me, don't you?\\
429 - No, Mom.\\
430 - We did not send you to Marlin Academy\\
431 - so that you could undermine my authority long-distance.\\
432 - Well, why did you send me?\\
433 - Well, it-it was not\\
434 - so that you could undermine my authority.\\
435 - And if I am not mistaken,\\
436 - you are undermining my authority!\\
437 - What are you doing?\\
438 - Y-You're spending your anniversary at home,\\
439 - fixating on a stupid dress.\\
440 - Is that what you wanted tonight?\\
441 - What am I supposed to do, Francis? Let it go?\\
442 - Yes, that is exactly what you should do.\\
443 - Let it go.\\
444 - But you can't, 'cause you can never let anything go.\\
445 - I can, too, let things go.\\
446 - Fine... I can...\\
447 - Fine. I can!\\
448 - Okay, just forget I said anything.\\
449 - I cannot talk to you anymore.\\
450 - Ooh, you make me so mad.\\
451 - Sometimes I just want to break your neck.\\
452 - Did you get the cookies I sent you?\\
453 - Yeah, they were great.\\
454 - Good.\\
455 - I swear to God, on paper, this was a great idea.\\
456 - All right, that's it.\\
457 - Get dressed-- we're going to dinner.\\
458 - Oh, my God, it did work.\\
459 - What?\\
460 - Dinner.\\
461 - I won't have you boys starving to death.\\
462 - Last thing I need is a bunch of social workers and reporters\\
463 - tearing up the front lawn.\\
464 - Now, hurry up before I change my mind.\\
465 - What about the dress?\\
466 - I really liked that dress.\\
467 - Hey, thanks for the ride, Tony.\\
468 - Anytime, Hal!\\
469 - Hello!\\
470 - Honey?\\
471 - Boys?\\
472 - Anybody home?\\
473 - Hotcha!\\
474 - This evening just keeps getting better and better.\\
475 - Hmm.\\
476 - Oh! No, no.\\
477 - Okay, okay.\\
478 - Geez, oh...\\
479 - Not again.

63 - Teacher's pet.\\
64 - "Dear... Penthouse..."\\
65 - "Yesterday I pushed my friend Stevie\\
66 - down some stairs."\\
67 - Point... taken.\\
68 - What?\\
69 - Malcolm, I'm a little concerned.\\
70 - You're doing very well in your studies,\\
71 - but... I still sense\\
72 - an emotional distance between us,\\
73 - and I hate it.\\
74 - I'd really like us to try to connect\\
75 - on a deeper level.\\
76 - Whoa. She is coming on to me.\\
77 - I thought you were dating the janitor.\\
78 - Who told you that?\\
79 - God. One drink and...\\
80 - Never mind.\\
81 - What I am trying to say is\\
82 - I know your parents.\\
83 - I know you have a colorful home life.\\
84 - So, just remember, if you ever need anything at all--\\
85 - a sympathetic ear, a shoulder to cry on--\\
86 - I want you to come to me.\\
87 - Yeah. That's what I need-- another mom.\\
88 - Okay. Great. Okay.\\
89 - Thanks a lot.\\
90 - Well, I got to go\\
91 - do the... thing.\\
92 - And then I drew a robot, Francis.\\
93 - But my crayon broke.\\
94 - And then I had a popsicle.\\
95 - I mean,\\
96 - I had 12 popsicles.\\
97 - You like popsicles, Francis?\\
98 - Shut up, Dewey. Stop bugging Francis.\\
99 - I'm so glad you're home.\\
100 - You don't know what it's like\\
101 - dealing with these little kids all day.\\
102 - It's the coolest thing.\\
103 - It's the first time Francis is home from military school.\\
104 - Mom and Dad are going off to some wedding,\\
105 - and Francis is in charge of us for the whole weekend.\\
106 - I can't believe how much I missed him.\\
107 - Hey.\\
108 - Huh.\\
109 - He's so great.\\
110 - Boys! The number for the hotel is on the counter.\\
111 - I left money for pizza,\\
112 - but I want a receipt and exact change.\\
113 - Yep, that underwear is going to wrinkle.\\
114 - You know, it's kind of nice having Francis\\
115 - back in the house, don't you think?\\
116 - What?\\
117 - Nothing. You're just cute\\
118 - when you think you're being subtle.\\
119 - Really?\\
120 - Of course it's nice having Francis home.\\
121 - Well, it's been a few months now.\\
122 - Maybe it's time to, you know, think about it.\\
123 - I don't know. Maybe.\\
124 - We'll see how he does this weekend.\\
125 - God, I hate this hairdo.\\
126 - I don't even know why I bother\\
127 - trying to impress your family anymore.\\
128 - They've always hated me.\\
129 - Well, you are the one who stole\\
130 - their little Hally away from them.\\
131 - Better get moving.\\
132 - And then it got away.\\
133 - But I found another one, but it died.\\
134 - And then...\\
135 - I said leave him alone, you butt-munch.\\
136 - Let me go.\\
137 - Make me.\\
138 - Guys, quit it.\\
139 - Listen for a second.\\
140 - I just heard Mom and Dad.\\
141 - They're thinking about letting Francis come home.\\
142 - You serious?\\
143 - Yeah. They want to see\\
144 - how he does with us this weekend.\\
145 - Okay? So we can't screw up.\\
146 - Cool.\\
147 - Let's go tell him. No.\\
148 - You know how Francis gets when people tell him what to do.\\
149 - I am warning you.\\
150 - If you get your nose pierced,\\
151 - you are going to military school.\\
152 - And I mean it. Really.\\
153 - Do you hear me?\\
154 - Hey, Mom.\\
155 - What's for dinner?\\
156 - Right.\\
157 - What are we going to do?\\
158 - We're going to be good, that's what.\\
159 - How do we be good?\\
160 - I don't know.\\
161 - Honestly, it's never come up before.\\
162 - Look, we're just not going to do anything.\\
163 - That way, we can't get in any trouble.\\
164 - Honey.\\
165 - We're late. We better hit the road.\\
166 - Fine. I'll shave my legs in the car.\\
167 - Okay. I've marked all the liquor bottles,\\
168 - and we can taste when they're watered down.\\
169 - I've locked out the smut channel on the TV,\\
170 - counted your father's cigars.\\
171 - I've checked the odometer on the car.\\
172 - I know the exact balance of all our credit cards.\\
173 - We love you. Have a good time.\\
174 - And just remember, Dewey will tell us\\
175 - everything you did while we're gone.\\
176 - Uh, what your mother said, boys.\\
177 - Minus one.\\
178 - Don't even think about it.\\
179 - Think about what?\\
180 - She's bluffing.\\
181 - Okay, I am going to show you guys\\
182 - the coolest thing you have ever seen.\\
183 - Get me some lighter fluid,\\
184 - a waffle iron and one of Dewey's stuffed animals.\\
185 - The furrier, the better.\\
186 - Actually, we're kind of tired.\\
187 - Tired?\\
188 - Yeah. Tired.\\
189 - I'm not tired.\\
190 - Okay, yeah, I'm tired.\\
191 - Let's just go watch TV.\\
192 - Whatever.\\
193 - ...lines up his shot.\\
194 - I've never seen this kind of excitement...\\
195 - This plan better work.\\
196 - The only thing worse than no TV\\
197 - is golf on TV.\\
198 - Oh, come on, guys. Let's go outside.\\
199 - Let's go do something.\\
200 - No. They're only on the sixth hole.\\
201 - They're only on the sixth hole.\\
202 - Hello.\\
203 - Francis, bud, I heard you were in town.\\
204 - You da man, Francis!\\
205 - Hey, guys, what's going on?\\
206 - Same old, same old, man.\\
207 - Oh, Circus says hi.\\
208 - Dude, you're not going to believe it.\\
209 - I finally moved out.\\
210 - I'm living in the basement now.\\
211 - Total freedom, dude.\\
212 - You da man, Francis!\\
213 - Mom, you're supposed to knock.\\
214 - Dude, we're coming over.\\
215 - Okay. Hey, Richie and the guys are coming over.\\
216 - Maybe they shouldn't.\\
217 - You know, Mom and Dad are gone.\\
218 - Okay, got it. Hey, Richie, listen to me.\\
219 - I'm watching my brothers, so we got to hang here.\\
220 - And no parties, okay?\\
221 - I'm serious.\\
222 - It's got to be just the three of you.\\
223 - Huh. You wouldn't think only three guys\\
224 - could do so much damage.\\
225 - Call us next time you're in town.\\
226 - You da man, Francis!\\
227 -     Skyrockets in flight    \\
228 -     Afternoon delight...    \\
229 - Are you trying to seduce me?\\
230 - I can't believe we're going to this wedding.\\
231 - What a waste of time.\\
232 - Oh, come on, I promise it'll be fun.\\
233 - Hal, I'm not Dewey.\\
234 - Sorry. But still, we're alone,\\
235 - we're away from the kids.\\
236 - Right now, we're just two unencumbered consenting adults.\\
237 - I say we enjoy it.\\
238 - Yeah, you're right.\\
239 - It will be nice to have some time for just the two of us.\\
240 - And I'm going to love not having\\
241 - to yell at somebody every 20 seconds.\\
242 - Either speed up or get off the road, jackass!\\
243 - Absolutely deserved it.\\
244 - I hate those guys.\\
245 - Did you see Circus break that cinder block with his head?\\
246 - That's a good lesson for you guys.\\
247 - It didn't break the first six times.\\
248 - But did he quit trying? No, sir.\\
249 - Francis, we have to clean this up.\\
250 - Yeah.\\
251 - No. I mean now.\\
252 - If Mom and Dad see this, they'll freak.\\
253 - So what else is new? They always freak.\\
254 - I'm used to it. No!\\
255 - This is different. We have to clean up.\\
256 - Okay, what's with you guys? I'm in charge here.\\
257 - I'm the only one who's going to get in trouble. Just relax.\\
258 - But we want you to come home.\\
259 - What?\\
260 - I heard Mom and Dad talking.\\
261 - This weekend is like a test for you. Or a trap.\\
262 - If you do good, they may let you come home.\\
263 - And if you don't,\\
264 - they're going to toss your butt\\
265 - back into military school.\\
266 - Okay, look... Francis,\\
267 - it sucks around here without you.\\
268 - Can't you just try for our sake?\\
269 - Look, guys, I appreciate your sentiment.\\
270 - But they're not going to decide my whole future\\
271 - based on how I behave over one weekend\\
272 - without even telling me about it.\\
273 - It's too arbitrary. It's unreasonable.\\
274 - It's Mom.\\
275 - Okay, let's clean up.\\
276 -     I'm not done    \\
277 -     And I won't be    \\
278 -     Till my head falls off.    \\
279 - It's perfect.\\
280 - The house has never been this clean.\\
281 - Uh-oh.\\
282 - What?\\
283 - It's too clean.\\
284 - You're right.\\
285 - They'll never buy it.\\
286 -     I'm not done    \\
287 -     And I won't be    \\
288 -     Till my head falls off    \\
289 -     Though it may not be    \\
290 -     A long way off    \\
291 -     I won't be done until my head    \\
292 -     Falls off.    \\
293 - Ah. Looks like we're the only ones\\
294 - who gave them pot holders.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - Hi. Hi.\\
297 - It's great to see you.\\
298 - You, too. You look terrific.\\
299 - How long do you think it's been?\\
300 - I don't know.\\
301 - Will you excuse me?\\
302 - Oh, that was worth driving 600 miles for.\\
303 - Who was that guy?\\
304 - It's the groom, Hal.\\
305 - Huh.\\
306 - I wish people would wear name tags at these things.\\
307 - Oh, perfect.\\
308 - Nice touch with the bread crumbs, Dewey.\\
309 - Huh?\\
310 - I clipped my toenails\\
311 - on the coffee table.\\
312 - Attaboy. She will never know a thing.\\
313 - Wait.\\
314 - Ta-da!\\
315 - Ow!\\
316 - Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
317 - Malcolm. Ow! Ow.\\
318 - Malcolm, are you okay?\\
319 - I think so.\\
320 - Ow!\\
321 - Hold still.\\
322 - Come here, let me see it.\\
323 - Let me see it.\\
324 - How does it look?\\
325 - Not... too bad.\\
326 - Put his face back on! What?\\
327 - Oh, man, what's that white stuff? Is that bone?\\
328 - What?! Reese, get ice and some paper towels.\\
329 - Ow! Ow! Ow! Sit down. We have to put pressure on it.\\
330 - Ow! Ow! I'm sorry.\\
331 - I have to put pressure on it.\\
332 - Reese, give me the ice! Come on.\\
333 - We don't have any ice. We got this.\\
334 - Fine. Give me some antiseptic.\\
335 - Don't answer that. Let the machine...\\
336 - Hello.\\
337 - - Hi, Dewey. - Hi, Mom.\\
338 - Hi. We're just calling to check in.\\
339 - Let me speak with Francis.\\
340 - He's...\\
341 - ...in the bathroom.\\
342 - Oh. Well, let me talk to Malcolm.\\
343 - He's in the bathroom.\\
344 - They're both in the bathroom?\\
345 - What are they doing in there?\\
346 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
347 - We have to get you stitches. Let's go to the hospital.\\
348 - No! You can't. Mom and Dad will find out.\\
349 - Malcolm, this is a head injury.\\
350 - You could have a concussion.\\
351 - Concussion? I think he's making too much of this.\\
352 - I'm not as figgled as he hoogers.\\
353 - No! I don't care. I'm not going to the hospital.\\
354 - Do you hear me?\\
355 - There is no way that I...\\
356 - Get the car.\\
357 - I can't see anything.\\
358 - Do you want to get blood all over the car?\\
359 - Wait! We can't take the car. They'll know.\\
360 - Mom checked the odometer, remember?\\
361 - I'm on top of it.\\
362 - Whee! Hi, school!\\
363 - Oh, Malcolm, you should see this!\\
364 - Francis is kicking ass!\\
365 - I hate this '80s crap.\\
366 - One good thing about a head injury:\\
367 - There's a good chance I won't remember any of this.\\
368 - Oh, great. A one-way street.\\
369 - How does that work if I'm going backwards?\\
370 - And on this joyous day,\\
371 - as we celebrate the occasion of two souls\\
372 - joining into one...\\
373 - Do you think this is going to be\\
374 - one of those long services?\\
375 - What's wrong?\\
376 - Did you know that your family\\
377 - has given me a nickname?\\
378 - Really?\\
379 - That's nice.\\
380 - What is it?\\
381 - Lois... Common... Denominator.\\
382 - Hey, come on.\\
383 - It's just that they've never seen anyone like you.\\
384 - I mean, you're, you're honest, and, uh...\\
385 - unpretentious.\\
386 - Direct.\\
387 - They're baffled by that.\\
388 - I'm the only one that gets you, Lois,\\
389 - and, frankly, I...\\
390 - I like that.\\
391 - Kind of makes you my secret treasure.\\
392 - Oh, Hal.\\
393 - ...between the Lord and us, his servants,\\
394 - two people brought together in love...\\
395 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
396 - You kids again?\\
397 - And a head injury.\\
398 - You boys like to keep it interesting, don't you?\\
399 - We kind of have a history here.\\
400 -     I was in the right place    \\
401 -     But it must have been the wrong time    \\
402 -     I was saying the right thing    \\
403 -     But I must have used the wrong line    \\
404 -     I was in the right world    \\
405 -     But it seem like it's wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.    \\
406 - Look, Doc, uh, about the bill...\\
407 - Oh, don't worry. We'll send it to your parents.\\
408 - Yeah, well...\\
409 - we were kind of thinking we'd pay for it now.\\
410 - Okeydokey, but it's probably going to be about $400.\\
411 - What?! $400?\\
412 - Don't you have some kind\\
413 - of frequent customer discount like at the car wash?\\
414 - Or maybe we could work it off.\\
415 - We could empty bedpans, or wash cadavers.\\
416 - It's probably not nearly as cool as it sounds.\\
417 - Sorry.\\
418 - Well, we're screwed.\\
419 - Come on, there's got to be something\\
420 - we can do, someone we can call.\\
421 - There's no one, Malcolm.\\
422 - Actually, there might be,\\
423 - but I'm not sure if it's worth it.\\
424 - Oh, Malcolm!\\
425 - Are you all right?\\
426 - Sorry it took me so long.\\
427 - I was having a little Chardonnay when you called,\\
428 - and I had to take a cab.\\
429 - Oh, God, I knew we made a deeper connection.\\
430 - I just knew it.\\
431 - Now, I know it's going to be hard\\
432 - to turn against your parents, but in time, you'll see...\\
433 - No! You don't understand.\\
434 - My parents didn't do this.\\
435 - It was just an accident,\\
436 - and they can't find out about it.\\
437 - What?\\
438 - It's kind of complicated.\\
439 - See, my parents are away at a wedding,\\
440 - and my brother is home\\
441 - from military school to take care of us.\\
442 - And, you know, I don't think people\\
443 - should be punished just 'cause their dad uses cheap nails.\\
444 - And we need... We need $400, lady.\\
445 - Will you let me talk?!\\
446 - We need the money for the doctor bill\\
447 - because if my parents find out that I got hurt,\\
448 - then they'll send Francis away, and we'll never\\
449 - see him again, and, you know, we love him.\\
450 - Malcolm, I can't do that.\\
451 - But you said, if I ever needed anything...\\
452 - Yes, I was talking about emotional stuff.\\
453 - I... Do you have any idea what a teacher earns?\\
454 - I have $62 in my checking account.\\
455 - They take credit cards.\\
456 - I'm sorry.\\
457 - I'm... I'm-I'm just sorry.\\
458 - We can break her. Guilt. Go for guilt.\\
459 - I got it.\\
460 - That's okay.\\
461 - Thanks, anyway.\\
462 - Well, squirt, looks like I'm\\
463 - going to be going back to military school\\
464 - and I'm not going to see you for a really,\\
465 - really long time.\\
466 - But I need you to be brave.\\
467 - Can you do that for me, huh, squirt?\\
468 - Stop, Francis!\\
469 - I wish I could, kiddo,\\
470 - but I can't.\\
471 - Why are you doing this?\\
472 - I'm not doing this, Dewey.\\
473 - It's just the way life is sometimes.\\
474 - Please stop crying.\\
475 - It hurts! I know it does.\\
476 - It hurts me, too.\\
477 - Wait! I'll, I'll do it.\\
478 - I guess Jamaica isn't going anywhere.\\
479 - Where is my credit card?\\
480 - It fell out of your wallet.\\
481 - How did that happen? It...\\
482 - Let's go.\\
483 - Processing is right over there.\\
484 - It's right near the vending machines.\\
485 - Do you have any change?\\
486 - Thank you.\\
487 - Way to take one for the team, buddy.\\
488 - When we get home,\\
489 - you can eat ice cream until you puke.\\
490 - Yay.\\
491 - Huh. Well...\\
492 - I don't see any holes\\
493 - or crappy attempts to plaster them up.\\
494 - But I'm sure there's something.\\
495 - There's always something.\\
496 - What are you hiding underneath that hat?\\
497 - Nothing. I was just wearing...\\
498 - You boys.\\
499 - That's it?!\\
500 - So, you guys think Francis did a good job\\
501 - taking care of us, then?\\
502 - Oh, a great job.\\
503 - - Yeah? - Absolutely.\\
504 - You know, Francis, we were having our doubts\\
505 - about that school, but it's really matured you.\\
506 - In fact, I think it's the best decision we ever made.\\
507 - Mom: 62,437.\\
508 - Kids: zero.\\
509 - So, we get to see Francis again in a month or two.\\
510 - I know. It sucks, but we gave it a shot.\\
511 - And school's easier now because Caroline won't even\\
512 - make eye contact with me anymore,\\
513 - so it wasn't a complete waste, and Mom always says\\
514 - it's not a wasted experience if you learn something from it,\\
515 - and I definitely think I did.\\
516 - Okay! Ready!
\subsection {Episode 04: Shame}
1 - We're gathered here today to say good-bye\\
2 - to Jumpy number eight.\\
3 - Nine...\\
4 - Nine.\\
5 - He was a good...\\
6 - Nine?\\
7 - Are you sure, nine?\\
8 - Anyway, he was a very good frog.\\
9 - And he led a very full life.\\
10 - I remember when I stuck him in Mom's sun visor,\\
11 - and she almost hit that lady in the crosswalk.\\
12 - It was hysterical.\\
13 - Farewell, Jumpy number nine.\\
14 - We know you're going to a better place.\\
15 - Bye, Jumpy.\\
16 - Dad...\\
17 - May he rest in pieces.\\
18 - Amen. Amen. Amen.\\
19 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
20 -     I don't know    \\
21 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     And you're not so big    \\
30 -     Life is unfair.    \\
31 - Kenarban...\\
32 - winds up.\\
33 - Bases loaded.\\
34 - Series on...\\
35 - the line.\\
36 - Will you just throw the ball?\\
37 - Aah!\\
38 - Want me to...\\
39 - kiss it?\\
40 - Oh, man, Kevin.\\
41 - I hate this guy.\\
42 - He's only been here for two weeks,\\
43 - and he's already the most obnoxious kid in the school.\\
44 - Little help.\\
45 - Lose your ball-ey, baby?\\
46 - Can I please have my ball back, Kevin?\\
47 - "Can I please have my ball back, Kevin?"\\
48 - Come on, Kevin. "Come on, Kevin."\\
49 - De gustibus non est disputandum.\\
50 - De kub...\\
51 - You stink!\\
52 - Your new name is Stinky.\\
53 - Whatever, just give me my ball back.\\
54 - You want it?\\
55 - Go get it, Stinky.\\
56 - Men, most of you are at an age\\
57 - where your bodies have undergone\\
58 - significant changes.\\
59 - While the benefits of increased muscle mass\\
60 - and a more authoritative speaking register are plain,\\
61 - these changes can produce certain...\\
62 - negative desires.\\
63 - Uh, we used to handle it with cold showers\\
64 - and regularly scheduled beatings,\\
65 - but, sadly, times have changed,\\
66 - and I am forced to rely on a less effective option:\\
67 - education.\\
68 - Pretty, isn't she? Hmm?\\
69 - Perhaps her name is Mary\\
70 - or Wendy or Becky Lou-- it doesn't matter\\
71 - because her real name is disease.\\
72 - Not so pretty anymore, is she, men?\\
73 - Cankers...\\
74 - lesions...\\
75 - furuncles.\\
76 - Such is the price of weakness.\\
77 - I can't believe they're swallowing this.\\
78 - Standard technique.\\
79 - Generate a fear response, make the brain more receptive.\\
80 - I don't care.\\
81 - Spangler has ruined everything in our lives.\\
82 - Now he has to ruin sex?\\
83 - Now, remember, every one of these diseases\\
84 - can easily be transmitted to you.\\
85 - Excuse me, sir?\\
86 - Isn't that slide upside down?\\
87 - No, son.\\
88 - No, it isn't.\\
89 - Okay, pal, all right.\\
90 - I'll get the ice pack.\\
91 - Dewey, we told you to stop climbing that tree.\\
92 - It's too big.\\
93 - I couldn't help it.\\
94 - I know, sweetheart.\\
95 - That's it, I've had it.\\
96 - That sucker's coming down.\\
97 - You're gonna cut down the tree?\\
98 - Darn right.\\
99 - I'm sick and tired of raking leaves\\
100 - and hosing bird poop off our car.\\
101 - And seeing that weird face in the bark\\
102 - that follows you wherever you go.\\
103 - And now it's going after the children?\\
104 - No, Lois, it has to be stopped.\\
105 - Can I help kill it?\\
106 - Sure, sweetheart.\\
107 - We'll take turns.\\
108 - All right, frozen pizza.\\
109 - The only thing Rowena can't ruin.\\
110 - Hey, no cuts.\\
111 - "Hey, no cuts."\\
112 - Two slices, please.\\
113 - Is there any more pizza?\\
114 - No, all out.\\
115 - It's American goulash for you.\\
116 - What... is that?\\
117 - I don't know.\\
118 - All I can identify are little pieces of carrot and...\\
119 - I don't know, I think they're Skittles.\\
120 - Hey, look at the goulash boy.\\
121 - Get away from me, Kevin.\\
122 - Ooh, "Get away from me, Kevin."\\
123 - He's so sad that he doesn't have pizza,\\
124 - and I do.\\
125 - I said get away.\\
126 - Chill... man.\\
127 - I got...\\
128 - your back.\\
129 - What are you looking at, Kenar-butt?\\
130 - Light...\\
131 - some shadows.\\
132 - Kevin, I'm warning you.\\
133 - Get out of my face.\\
134 - Aw, Malcolm doesn't like me eating close to his face\\
135 - with pizza I have and he doesn't.\\
136 - Pizza, pizza, pizza.\\
137 - Pizza...\\
138 - Pizza...\\
139 - Pizza...\\
140 - You want pizza?\\
141 - I'll give you pizza.\\
142 - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\\
143 - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\\
144 - Wow, watching hockey has really paid off.\\
145 - I can't believe how good I'm doing.\\
146 - What do you mean he's only seven?\\
147 - What's not to understand?\\
148 - He just turned seven.\\
149 - I guess you were too busy beating people to notice.\\
150 - He can't be seven-- he's bigger than I am.\\
151 - He's in second grade.\\
152 - Look at all this blood.\\
153 - That's not blood, it's pizza sauce.\\
154 - Well, that's blood, but...\\
155 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\\
156 - What happened?\\
157 - I want my Teletubby!\\
158 - A doll?\\
159 - You can't play with dolls if you're seven.\\
160 - Why are you seven?\\
161 - You beat up a seven-year-old?!\\
162 - I didn't know!\\
163 - Malcolm, I don't blame you.\\
164 - I put this squarely where it belongs.\\
165 - On me.\\
166 - Oh, man, this is the most horrible thing I've ever done.\\
167 - Kevin, I'm sorry.\\
168 - I think you've done quite enough.\\
169 - This is the worst birthday ever!\\
170 - "Inappropriate,\\
171 - vicious."\\
172 - Oh, wait-- "Thug"?\\
173 - Dude, I've never gotten "thug" before.\\
174 - That's like the Oscar.\\
175 - Susie Gunther ate my crayons.\\
176 - Can you beat her up tomorrow?\\
177 - Leave me alone.\\
178 - You know what my favorite part is?\\
179 - It's when you pound on someone, and then a day later,\\
180 - you still feel the pain in your knuckles.\\
181 - Oh, I love that.\\
182 - Shut up, Reese.\\
183 - Hey, hey, pace yourself, killer.\\
184 - Whoa.\\
185 - Dad.\\
186 - You cut down the tree, and we missed it?\\
187 - Oh, baby, you missed it, all right.\\
188 - I was about two-thirds of the way through her,\\
189 - then crack!\\
190 - Kaboom!\\
191 - My chain saw goes flying.\\
192 - All the car alarms go off.\\
193 - About a hundred squirrels came boiling out of the branches.\\
194 - Then a pack of dogs came out of nowhere\\
195 - and chased them all over the neighborhood.\\
196 - Man, I've never seen anything like it.\\
197 - Man...\\
198 - Oh, don't worry, son.\\
199 - You'll get to share in the best part.\\
200 - Cleaning up.\\
201 - Boys, I think you'll enjoy\\
202 - my sexual awareness lecture next week.\\
203 - It's been called "riveting."\\
204 - It-it sure worked wonders for me, sir.\\
205 - The only woman I can think of\\
206 - without vomiting is my own mother.\\
207 - As it should be, son, as it should be.\\
208 - He's giving that same lecture to the underclassmen.\\
209 - I can't let that happen.\\
210 - I'm stealing his slides.\\
211 - And to you, that's a good idea?\\
212 - Oh, absolutely.\\
213 - I know it's hard-core, Stanley,\\
214 - but I'm not doing this for me.\\
215 - I'm doing it for them.\\
216 - After all, they are the future.\\
217 - Francis, I don't know why you assume\\
218 - we'll be able to just walk into Spangler's office\\
219 - and find the sex slides.\\
220 - Oh, man, I wish all my break-ins were this easy.\\
221 - Okay, I got it.\\
222 - Let's get out of here.\\
223 - Wait a second.\\
224 - Oh, my God, this is a gold mine.\\
225 - Spangler drinking.\\
226 - Spangler kissing.\\
227 - Spangler in a Speedo.\\
228 - Spangler out of a Speedo.\\
229 - All right, that's enough.\\
230 - Let's leave, huh?\\
231 - Wait a second.\\
232 - I have an idea.\\
233 - I'm gonna make Spangler's sexual awareness lecture\\
234 - just a little more interesting.\\
235 - Now, Francis, you do realize what he'll do to you\\
236 - if you humiliate him like this, right?\\
237 - And yet I'm doing it anyway.\\
238 - Weird, huh?\\
239 - Why are the eggs so little?\\
240 - They're robin's eggs from the tree your father cut down.\\
241 - Paul Bunyan.\\
242 - That's nature for you.\\
243 - Hundred years to grow, 12 minutes to cut down.\\
244 - There's got to be a lesson in there somewhere.\\
245 - It is nice having this extra light in the room.\\
246 - Yeah, wait till I bring in the wood chipper.\\
247 - Then you're really gonna see something.\\
248 - I can't take this anymore.\\
249 - When are you gonna punish me?\\
250 - For what?\\
251 - For beating up a seven-year-old.\\
252 - Oh, my God, that's right.\\
253 - You must've just felt ridiculous\\
254 - when you found out how old that kid was.\\
255 - I can only imagine the look on your face.\\
256 - I'll get it.\\
257 - Oh, this is nice.\\
258 - We should start every day with a good laugh.\\
259 - It's not funny.\\
260 - It's awful.\\
261 - I did something horrible.\\
262 - Don't you even care?\\
263 - Well, it's nothing to be proud of, son,\\
264 - but you told us the whole story,\\
265 - and he didn't give you much choice.\\
266 - It was an honest beating mistake.\\
267 - Besides, it sends a good message to our enemies.\\
268 - What are you talking about?\\
269 - What enemies?\\
270 - Oh, they're out there.\\
271 - And once they know we're capable of this,\\
272 - they'll know we're capable of anything.\\
273 - Okay, so it's not just me, right?\\
274 - There's something seriously wrong with this family.\\
275 - It's none of your business what we do on our property.\\
276 - That tree was older than your house.\\
277 - You had no right to cut it down.\\
278 - We're a neighborhood, and removing trees\\
279 - is a neighborhood decision.\\
280 - Oh, y-you people-- for 15 years you've mowed your lawns\\
281 - in the middle of the night so you don't have to talk to us.\\
282 - Now, what, all of a sudden we're a neighborhood?\\
283 - What's going on here?\\
284 - You've caused a blight on our street\\
285 - by cutting down that tree.\\
286 - How is cutting down a tree a blight?\\
287 - Because now we can see your house.\\
288 - Well, let me tell you something, Ed.\\
289 - As far as I'm concerned, you and the neighbors can all just...\\
290 - Eh? And that goes double for me.\\
291 - I want you all off our property now or I'll...\\
292 - No wonder I'm a thug.\\
293 - How can they act like this?\\
294 - And then I found out that he was only seven.\\
295 - I didn't know what to do.\\
296 - I just felt like I had to talk to someone.\\
297 - I hope I'm doing this right.\\
298 - See, my family-- we're not, like, regular churchgoers,\\
299 - but I know places like this are supposed\\
300 - to help you feel better,\\
301 - and that's really what I need.\\
302 - I did something terrible,\\
303 - and now I just feel like there's something wrong with me.\\
304 - I mean, really wrong, deep inside.\\
305 - I can't shake it.\\
306 - What do I do?\\
307 - Look to the church.\\
308 - Look to God.\\
309 - Look within.\\
310 - But first you must ask forgiveness. First, you must atone.\\
311 - First, you must cleanse your spirit.\\
312 - The path to salvation.\\
313 - The path to temptation.\\
314 - The path to meditation.\\
315 - How does one define a sin?\\
316 - Well, it's mostly common sense.\\
317 - And you have to light incense.\\
318 - If you practiced abstinence.\\
319 - It's whatever space you're in.\\
320 - Huh?\\
321 - Ch-Ch-Charity. Prosperity.\\
322 - Clarity. Divine.\\
323 - Restitution. Absolution.\\
324 - Contribution. Palestine.\\
325 - Sacramental. Accidental.\\
326 - Mostly mental. You'll be fine.\\
327 - Transubstantiate. Alleviate.\\
328 - Who knows? Align your spine.\\
329 - Uh... well, thanks.\\
330 - I feel much better. Bye.\\
331 - Hey, boys.\\
332 - Where's your brother?\\
333 - I don't know.\\
334 - He said something about being evil,\\
335 - and he took off. Ah.\\
336 - Uh, stay back.\\
337 - Wow!\\
338 - That was the coolest thing I've ever seen!\\
339 - Really? All it does is\\
340 - instantly vaporize anything that goes into it.\\
341 - Dewey!\\
342 - What was...?!\\
343 - Actually, that was pretty cool.\\
344 - What else you got?\\
345 -        \\
346 - Well, we've obviously run out of ideas.\\
347 - Yolanda, this is a love that cannot be.\\
348 - Stop!\\
349 - Can't you put some life in it?\\
350 - It's 1969!\\
351 - The slide rule is about to be replaced\\
352 - by the pocket calculator.\\
353 - You have to feel the panic in the air. Ugh!\\
354 - I can't stop thinking about what I did to Kevin.\\
355 - I feel like crap, and no one understands.\\
356 - Even you.\\
357 - You're supposed to be my friend\\
358 - and you don't even care.\\
359 - And yet... you keep... talking.\\
360 - Maybe if I did something good,\\
361 - that would cancel it out, right?\\
362 - Or if I'm only doing it to feel better,\\
363 - is that selfish and doesn't count as much?\\
364 - Stevie?\\
365 - Okay. So I just have to think of a really giant good deed.\\
366 - That way, I know I'll be in the plus column.\\
367 - I bet I can think of something great.\\
368 - I just have to put some thought into it.\\
369 - There!\\
370 - That's perfect.\\
371 - I'll run the marathon\\
372 - and get people to pledge money for every mile that I go.\\
373 - I hate running, so it'll be hard\\
374 - and I'll have to train for it, so it'll take dedication\\
375 - and it'll be helping cure diseases\\
376 - which no one likes.\\
377 - And then I can get on with my life.\\
378 - No! No! No!\\
379 - I can't work like this!\\
380 - I'll be at my cubby.\\
381 - This'll work.\\
382 - It has to.\\
383 -        \\
384 - There we go.\\
385 - Looks great, Dad.\\
386 - Yeah? I don't know.\\
387 - Now that it's in there,\\
388 - it sort of makes me miss the old tree.\\
389 - This one's a little droopy\\
390 - and the branches are a little spindly\\
391 - and there's no face.\\
392 - Well, there's that, that little one,\\
393 - but it's not the...\\
394 - kindly little spooky face...\\
395 - Oh, my God!\\
396 - What have I done?\\
397 - Reese,\\
398 - get my chain saw.\\
399 - I hear your son likes to beat up seven-year-olds.\\
400 - I wouldn't say he likes it.\\
401 - He's good at it, apparently, but...\\
402 - Look...\\
403 - in my family\\
404 - we don't go for that.\\
405 - Probably not a good idea to poke me.\\
406 - "Probably not a good idea to poke me."\\
407 - I'm sorry I beat him up,\\
408 - but how was I supposed to know he was 15?\\
409 - He was huge.\\
410 - You should have seen the grip he had on my throat.\\
411 - Okay, people.\\
412 - I need all the pledge sheets before we can begin.\\
413 - Thank you, thank you, thank you.\\
414 - Caroline?\\
415 - Malcolm, I am so glad\\
416 - you decided to do this.\\
417 - Now, were you able to get any pledges?\\
418 - Here.\\
419 - I don't suppose there's a beer guy around here, huh?\\
420 - This is a charity race at an elementary school.\\
421 - Oh. So I have to go to a stand or something, huh?\\
422 - My God.\\
423 - Are these real?\\
424 - Well, I assume so. Why?\\
425 - Well, look at all of them.\\
426 - He has more pledges here\\
427 - than everyone else put together.\\
428 - If he runs the distance,\\
429 - he is going to raise over $8,000.\\
430 - Ow.\\
431 - Perhaps her name is Mary\\
432 - or... Wendy or Becky Lou.\\
433 - It doesn't matter because her real name\\
434 - is disease.\\
435 - Isn't so pretty anymore, is she, boys?\\
436 - Cankers...\\
437 - lesions...\\
438 - furuncles--\\
439 - such is the pri...\\
440 - Why, these aren't the proper slides.\\
441 - Some hooligan has switched them.\\
442 - Now, this is obviously some ingenious scheme\\
443 - to humiliate me.\\
444 - I find myself\\
445 - so overcome with embarrassment, I can't stop clicking.\\
446 - Although there's probably one in here of a cadet\\
447 - who thinks he's all alone, and...\\
448 - well...\\
449 - technical difficulties.\\
450 - We will resume the lecture...\\
451 - with the proper slides\\
452 - at 0800 tomorrow.\\
453 - Gentlemen.\\
454 - Remember, son,\\
455 - a good soldier always checks the chamber.\\
456 - Okay, this is going to sting.\\
457 - What is with you?\\
458 - Nothing.\\
459 - Usually you scream like a stuck pig\\
460 - when I put this stuff on.\\
461 - You have been such a zombie lately.\\
462 - It feels worse on the inside than it does on my knee.\\
463 - What are you talking about?\\
464 - Mom, I can't stop feeling bad about what I did to Kevin.\\
465 - I feel like I have a monster inside of me.\\
466 - Oh, for crying out loud, Malcolm,\\
467 - that's no monster.\\
468 - That's your conscience.\\
469 - You should be thankful God gave you one.\\
470 - Yeah. It feels great.\\
471 - I'm serious.\\
472 - It's a gift.\\
473 - And you know what most people do with theirs?\\
474 - They keep them in the closet all year and they bring them out\\
475 - only when they think he's coming to visit.\\
476 - You're not like that.\\
477 - Good for you.\\
478 - But I can't stop thinking about it.\\
479 - Ow!\\
480 - Were you thinking about it just then?\\
481 - No!\\
482 - See? I promise\\
483 - you will feel bad about Kevin\\
484 - only as long as you're supposed to.\\
485 - Now go to bed.\\
486 - You're a nice boy, Malcolm,\\
487 - and I'll kick the conniption\\
488 - out of anybody who says you aren't,\\
489 - including that little voice in your head.\\
490 - Okay.\\
491 - Good night, Mom. Good night, sweetie.\\
492 - Night, Dad. Good night, son.
\subsection {Episode 05: Malcolm Babysits}
1 - Pass the chips, please.\\
2 - Here you go.\\
3 - Thank you.\\
4 - You're welcome.\\
5 - Wow, that was a really great move.\\
6 - My head just went flying.\\
7 - Thank you. You're welcome.\\
8 - I told you boys these games are too violent.\\
9 - Here, watch something wholesome.\\
10 -     The sun is a mass of incandescent gas    \\
11 -     A gigantic nuclear furnace    \\
12 -     Where hydrogen is built...    \\
13 - Give me more chips!\\
14 - Get your own, doofus!\\
15 - Shut up! I'm watching!\\
16 - You shut up! I want more chips!\\
17 - Here!\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - $90 for a toy?\\
31 - It's not a toy. It's a robotics kit.\\
32 - You build a little mechanical rover.\\
33 - It teaches you about electronics and engineering.\\
34 - Does it teach you to pick up your socks?\\
35 - 'Cause that I'd be interested in.\\
36 - Besides, son,\\
37 - robots are evil. What?!\\
38 - Westworld, Terminator,\\
39 - the creepy maid from The Jetsons...\\
40 - how much scientific proof do you need?\\
41 - Mom! Malcolm, no!\\
42 - Look, if you want this thing so badly,\\
43 - you pay for it with your own money.\\
44 - You're gonna start babysitting next week, just save up.\\
45 - I don't even know what they're gonna pay me!\\
46 - I'll tell you what they're gonna pay you.\\
47 - They're gonna pay you what all jobs pay--\\
48 - less than you're worth and just enough to keep you\\
49 - crawling back for more. Now go on. It's bedtime.\\
50 - That's the way discussions go down in this family.\\
51 - I tell them my needs and they say no.\\
52 - Then dad reveals another cartoon character\\
53 - he's afraid of.\\
54 - Hey, how much time do you think we have?\\
55 - Not long enough for that look.\\
56 - You butt-wipe! That's my toothbrush.\\
57 - So use mine.\\
58 - You can't just take someone's toothbrush.\\
59 - Give me that.\\
60 - Fine.\\
61 - Oops.\\
62 - Hal... that is the third bug I've seen today.\\
63 - You have got to call the exterminator!\\
64 - What, and miss out on watching you hunt?\\
65 - You're like a sexy, bug-killing panther.\\
66 - Malcolm, stop!\\
67 - That's it!\\
68 - Bedtime was 20 minutes ago.\\
69 - Go to bed!\\
70 - Go to bed!\\
71 - Bed!\\
72 - Hal, bring the spray!\\
73 - I haven't rinsed yet.\\
74 - Only boys who behave themselves get to rinse.\\
75 - Honestly, every night we go through this!\\
76 - Mom, can I have a story?\\
77 - Once upon a time there was a little boy\\
78 - who made his mother so crazy\\
79 - she decided to sell him to the circus.\\
80 - An evil circus?\\
81 - No, a nice one with monkeys.\\
82 - Thank you. Ah, wait, wait, wait, wait,\\
83 - I think I see where they're coming from.\\
84 - Ah, you cannot hide.\\
85 - Aw... look at...\\
86 - Aw!\\
87 - Oh! Ooh!\\
88 - Oh!\\
89 - Aah! Aah! Just...\\
90 - Okay, come on, boys.\\
91 - We're all camping out in the den tonight.\\
92 - Here we go.\\
93 - Hey, Francis, aren't you going to open up\\
94 - your mom's care package?\\
95 - Give me a minute.\\
96 - I'm still savoring this.\\
97 - I swiped Commandant Spangler's master key.\\
98 - It opens every door in the academy, Stanley.\\
99 - Every door.\\
100 - You know, I think it's cookies.\\
101 - Who cares? I'm about to expose\\
102 - every secret sin this place conceals\\
103 - to the harsh light of day.\\
104 - So, can I open it?\\
105 - Yeah.\\
106 - So, what'd my mom send me?\\
107 - Bug-infested cookies.\\
108 - As usual, a mixed message.\\
109 - And this is the living room.\\
110 - This is the biggest, nicest house I've ever seen!\\
111 - Wow!\\
112 - Homocanthus imperator.\\
113 - We call him Barney.\\
114 - Malcolm?\\
115 - We saved you some dinner.\\
116 - Dinner? Me? Saved?\\
117 - Dinner?\\
118 - We weren't sure which you liked better--\\
119 - turkey or roast beef-- so we fixed you a platter.\\
120 - Platter?!\\
121 - Okay, kids, what time is it?\\
122 - Bedtime! Bedtime!\\
123 - Yay! I'll race you!\\
124 - They're going to bed?\\
125 - So you're just paying me\\
126 - to hang out here for three hours?\\
127 - Well, maybe three and a half.\\
128 - We'll round up to four, of course.\\
129 - Come on, there's got to be a catch!\\
130 - Oh, and Malcolm, you can't watch television...\\
131 - unless you turn on the satellite first.\\
132 - Otherwise, all you'll get is pornography.\\
133 - It's weird...\\
134 - I think I'm having a spasm.\\
135 - The muscles in my face keep pulling on my mouth.\\
136 - Oh, I think I'm happy!\\
137 - I just don't understand how it got so bad so fast.\\
138 - Well, it's been pretty hot this year.\\
139 - That's part of it, but, uh...\\
140 - mostly it's that giant pile of candy wrappers\\
141 - and half-eaten cereal boxes you have in your crawl space.\\
142 - It's like there's some kind of creepy hobo living down there.\\
143 - Whoa...\\
144 - there really is a lost bomb shelter.\\
145 - Wow, this is almost as exciting\\
146 - as that room full of folding chairs.\\
147 - Let's get out of here!\\
148 - Aw, come on, Francis.\\
149 - Don't you want to explore?\\
150 - We might find the abandoned furnace room\\
151 - or the old civil war amputorium.\\
152 - I didn't want to say this before, but you've confirmed it.\\
153 - Marlin Academy is the most boring place on earth.\\
154 - We're not gonna find anything interesting.\\
155 - I take that back.\\
156 - Look, the circus!\\
157 - The circus is at our house!\\
158 - Well, say good-bye for a few days, boys.\\
159 - We're moving out.\\
160 - This is humiliating.\\
161 - Why can't we just stay at a nice hotel?\\
162 - Because we're giving all our money to the exterminators\\
163 - so they can stay in nice hotels.\\
164 - Craig?\\
165 - Thank you so much for lending us your trailer.\\
166 - Oh, I'm just glad someone's finally\\
167 - getting some use out of it.\\
168 - I bought it 15 years ago to take on my honeymoon.\\
169 - You were married?\\
170 - No, I live on hope.\\
171 - Well... thanks again.\\
172 - You're welcome.\\
173 - Bye.\\
174 - Good-bye.\\
175 - Aw, this is cozy!\\
176 - It's 150 degrees in here!\\
177 - My butt is sweating.\\
178 - Ah, it just needs to air out a little.\\
179 - The trailer!\\
180 - Come on, let's make the best of this.\\
181 - I'm going to go babysit.\\
182 - It's still early. They don't mind.\\
183 - They paying you okay?\\
184 - Yeah.\\
185 - It's okay.\\
186 - I can't believe how much\\
187 - these people are paying me!\\
188 - I did the math.\\
189 - I'm actually making more an hour than mom does.\\
190 - I got to stop doing this.\\
191 - It's creepy, right?\\
192 - "Lester."\\
193 - Looks like he was the janitor.\\
194 - How long you think he's been down here?\\
195 - I'd say May of '85.\\
196 - You can tell that by tasting?\\
197 - No, the date on the newspaper.\\
198 - Then why did you lick him?\\
199 - How often do you get to taste a mummy?\\
200 - We should tell someone about him.\\
201 - Uh, no, you can't do that.\\
202 - Commandant will know you took the key,\\
203 - and he'll punish you.\\
204 - And then he'll punish me.\\
205 - And I'm gonna have to punish you.\\
206 - Yeah, but don't you think that's kind of sad?\\
207 - I mean, Lester's family will never know what happened to him.\\
208 - They probably still set a place for him on holidays.\\
209 - Yeah, well, judging by the empty scotch bottles\\
210 - and German dungeon porn, I don't think so.\\
211 - Damn. Beta.\\
212 - And you made fun of me\\
213 - when I bought this mesh underwear.\\
214 - Who looks like an idiot now?\\
215 - I stand corrected.\\
216 - Close the door. Were you raised in a barn?\\
217 - But it's cooler outside.\\
218 - Are you sure?\\
219 - Yeah.\\
220 - Well...\\
221 - I don't know.\\
222 - I don't know.\\
223 - Will you please make up your mind?\\
224 - There's no need for that kind of tone.\\
225 - It wasn't a tone.\\
226 - There it is again.\\
227 - Look, Hal, it's hot.\\
228 - We're all cranky.\\
229 - Will you please just drop it?\\
230 - Fine!\\
231 - I think you should apologize.\\
232 - Oh, you know, I didn't hear you apologizing to me\\
233 - when you used up all the liquid in the chemical toilet.\\
234 - Well, we have your taco casserole\\
235 - to thank for that, don't we?\\
236 - Boys, will you step outside for a second?\\
237 - Your father and I need a little privacy.\\
238 - Shoo!\\
239 - Look, I didn't want to say anything in front of the boys.\\
240 - But you are behaving like a giant ass!\\
241 - Oh, really?\\
242 - Well, as long as we're on the subject of giant asses...\\
243 - I'm ready to go.\\
244 - Hey, you want to see something?\\
245 - That's okay; I don't want to break it.\\
246 - Ah, don't be silly. Come, take a look.\\
247 - Wow.\\
248 - That's a spiral galaxy.\\
249 - These people are amazing.\\
250 - They're rich, they're smart, they're polite.\\
251 - What are they gonna do next, give me a million dollars?\\
252 - Malcolm, do you want a million dollars?\\
253 - What?!\\
254 - I said, do you want a sandwich to take home?\\
255 - Oh. Close enough.\\
256 - I only asked out your sister\\
257 - because you said you weren't interested!\\
258 - And I was thinking of you the whole time!\\
259 - Aw, don't give me that!\\
260 - I saw the charm bracelet!\\
261 - This isn't even mine!\\
262 - What, are you insane?\\
263 - You're throwing out stuff that's not even mine!\\
264 - What are you looking at?\\
265 - Hey, this is a private conversation, buster!\\
266 - Huh?\\
267 - Oh, yeah, like you've never seen this before!\\
268 - My mistake.\\
269 - I'm on the next street over.\\
270 - You were right about Lester. I checked him out--\\
271 - no wife, no kids.\\
272 - Poor guy didn't have a friend in the world.\\
273 - Here you go, Lester, buddy.\\
274 - Did you tell anyone about this place?\\
275 - No.\\
276 - Huh.\\
277 - Must've been me, then.\\
278 - All right, that's enough!\\
279 - Party's over!\\
280 - Don't you guys have any respect for the dead?\\
281 - You took his wallet!\\
282 - Lester would've wanted me to have his I.D.\\
283 - But that's not the point.\\
284 - This man was not just an alcoholic pervert janitor.\\
285 - He was one of us!\\
286 - He hated the commandant as much as we do.\\
287 - He was filled with impudent rage, like we are.\\
288 - This man was a hero.\\
289 - And heroes do not rot alone\\
290 - in basements.\\
291 - They're immortalized in song.\\
292 - They were sent off to Valhalla in flaming ships!\\
293 - They are not put\\
294 - in beer hats or used as photo props\\
295 - or given fake mustaches.\\
296 - Oh, man!\\
297 - That wasn't fake.\\
298 - My bad.\\
299 - What do we do now?\\
300 - Go for the spare.\\
301 - Up higher, Dewey. Reese, vertical, vertical!\\
302 - I already adjusted... Go like this.\\
303 - I know, but this... Push the button harder.\\
304 - Francis, I'm sorry I'm calling you so late.\\
305 - I had to talk to someone.\\
306 - Hey, no problem. What's going on?\\
307 - I don't know.\\
308 - Do you ever feel like you don't really belong in the family?\\
309 - Dude, I'm in military school.\\
310 - I think that question's been answered.\\
311 - Right.\\
312 - This is good.\\
313 - At least someone else in the family is normal.\\
314 - Hey, listen, while I got you, um...\\
315 - you're in school with all those science brains.\\
316 - How would you reattach a head\\
317 - to a dead body?\\
318 - Keep it down! Huh?\\
319 - Don't talk to your mother like that!\\
320 - Would you go sit in the corner?\\
321 - There are no corners!\\
322 - You ready to make up?\\
323 - No.\\
324 - Me, neither.\\
325 - Oh, hello, son.\\
326 - You know, I barely see you anymore.\\
327 - That babysitting has turned into a full-time job.\\
328 - Well, sometimes I just go over there to hang out\\
329 - and watch TV.\\
330 - Live in a house.\\
331 - Dad, does this seem okay to you?\\
332 - Gosh, no. Your mother and I\\
333 - have never fought for this long before.\\
334 - It's been days, and we still haven't made up.\\
335 - I don't even know what the problem is.\\
336 - Nah, something's missing.\\
337 - Boy...\\
338 - look at that sky, Malcolm.\\
339 - Just think,\\
340 - somewhere out there in all those stars and planets,\\
341 - there might be at this very moment\\
342 - a space dad who just got kicked out\\
343 - of his space trailer,\\
344 - who's looking down at us.\\
345 - Or would it be up at us?\\
346 - Or maybe sideways?\\
347 - Trust me, Dad. They're all looking down on us.\\
348 - The matinee gets out at 4:00,\\
349 - so we should be back before dinner.\\
350 - Okay. What do you want me to feed the kids for lunch?\\
351 - Hmm, whatever you want.\\
352 - We trust you.\\
353 - They trust me!\\
354 - People like this trust me!\\
355 - I obviously have to say something nice back to them.\\
356 - This is why my family sucks.\\
357 - I have no training in this.\\
358 - This job...\\
359 - me... like.\\
360 - We're thrilled to have found you, Malcolm.\\
361 - The kids love you.\\
362 - You're great to have around.\\
363 - You've really become one of the family.\\
364 - I may not have been switched at birth,\\
365 - but I should have been.\\
366 - I love these people.\\
367 - Okay, come on.\\
368 - Wait a minute.\\
369 - Sorry.\\
370 - Well...\\
371 - let's see what our little friend did today.\\
372 - Oh, hi.\\
373 - Don't worry.\\
374 - I'd never hurt Barney.\\
375 - He's part of the family.\\
376 - Just like I'm part of the family, right?\\
377 - And since a big part of this family\\
378 - is being such a huge phony\\
379 - and launching secret investigations\\
380 - against each other,\\
381 - I thought I'd join in.\\
382 - Personal computers are great.\\
383 - You can file tax returns, medical records,\\
384 - embarrassing private e-mail.\\
385 - Little security tip, though.\\
386 - Never use your birthday\\
387 - as your password.\\
388 - And hiding things in a fake salt can?\\
389 - That's just silly.\\
390 - I don't know who Melissa is,\\
391 - but she sure wears a lot of lipstick.\\
392 - Anyway, I think I hear you guys\\
393 - pulling up in the driveway.\\
394 - So let's just leave it at this:\\
395 - I quit.\\
396 - Bye.\\
397 - Who's Melissa?\\
398 - Hi, son. Didn't hear you drive up.\\
399 - I decided to walk.\\
400 - So, how's the job going?\\
401 - They were jerks, so I quit.\\
402 - Well, that's pretty much what work is.\\
403 - Welcome to the club.\\
404 - Dad?\\
405 - Hmm?\\
406 - I'm really sorry.\\
407 - What? About quitting?\\
408 - Ah... no big deal, especially for you.\\
409 - Malcolm, you should set your sights as high as you can.\\
410 - If anyone in this family has a shot at greatness, it's you.\\
411 - Just, uh... do me a favor, huh?\\
412 - Look after your brothers?\\
413 - Okay, wait, wait.\\
414 - You mean everything you just said, right?\\
415 - Why would I say something I didn't mean?\\
416 - See? That's what I'm talking about.\\
417 - This family may be rude, loud and gross\\
418 - and have no shame whatsoever.\\
419 - Anyway, with them\\
420 - you know where you stand,\\
421 - and when I have a problem, they're always there.\\
422 - Oh, my Lord.\\
423 - Sex!\\
424 - Things didn't work out so bad.\\
425 - I made enough money to get my robotics kit.\\
426 - Or maybe I should do something nice for my family.\\
427 - Take them to dinner...\\
428 - treat them to a movie.\\
429 - Naw, then I couldn't do this.\\
430 - If you don't change your underwear,\\
431 - this is exactly what happens.\\
432 - Like the ancient civilizations before us,\\
433 - we send off this noble man with the riches he had in life\\
434 - so he may enjoy them in the afterlife.\\
435 - Farewell, noble Lester.\\
436 - It's burning really fast.\\
437 - How much gas did you use?\\
438 - Half a can.\\
439 - Where'd you put the can?\\
440 - Oh.\\
441 - Look.\\
442 - It's heading toward the boathouse.\\
443 - What do you think?\\
444 - Run?\\
445 - Yeah. I'd run.\\
446 - I figured it out.\\
447 - Hal, you okay?\\
448 - Yeah, shh, shh, shh.\\
449 - Whenever we'd fight, you'd yell, then I'd yell,\\
450 - but then we would... you know.\\
451 - Well, you see, we haven't had a chance to\\
452 - because we're in a trailer with kids and we can't...\\
453 - Oh, my God, Hal, you're right.\\
454 - What are we going to do? We got the kids...\\
455 - No, n-no, I got it all figured out.\\
456 -     La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la    \\
457 -     Means "I love you"    \\
458 -     Oh, baby, please    \\
459 -     La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means "I love you..."    
\subsection {Episode 06: Sleepover}
1 - Squeeze in. Little closer together.\\
2 - Chins up like baby birds. Lovely.\\
3 - - Move. - Shut up.\\
4 - - Stop touching me. - I'm not touching you.\\
5 - I was clipping on my tie. While you were touching me.\\
6 - Stop it. Why do we have to do this?\\
7 - Because we don't have a single picture of us all together.\\
8 - That's ridiculous.\\
9 - We're a family-- we should have a family portrait.\\
10 - Well, Francis isn't here.\\
11 - Well, I'm not gonna cough up 200 bucks to fly him in\\
12 - for one silly picture.\\
13 - Where's Dewey?\\
14 - Dewey, get out of there-- that's not your family.\\
15 - You sure you want "autumn leaves" as a backdrop?\\
16 - Yes.\\
17 - You didn't even look at "happy windmills."\\
18 - It's more colorful.\\
19 - - "Space shuttle." - Next.\\
20 - Come on, let's go.\\
21 - I have a coupon here for one eight-by-ten and two wallet size\\
22 - for $9.99, and that's what I want.\\
23 - I don't want the "golden moments" collection.\\
24 - I don't want the "family and friends" collection.\\
25 - I don't want the "lifetime of love."\\
26 - I want one eight-by-ten and two wallet size for $9.99.\\
27 - Fine. We have an installment plan if that would help.\\
28 - I brought a picture of Francis.\\
29 - He's gonna be in the portrait. Cool.\\
30 - I'll hold it. No, I'm gonna hold it.\\
31 - Let go. I'm gonna hold it. Come on.\\
32 - Dewey, pants on, mister.\\
33 - I'm sorry, but this coupon's expired. What?\\
34 - It's expired.\\
35 - What you want will run you $39.50. Ooh, "lonely beach."\\
36 - We're kind of the "lonely beach" family, right? Hal.\\
37 - But for another $5.00, you can have the instant memory set.\\
38 - That comes with double exposure silhouettes\\
39 - for the grandparents.\\
40 - Look, could you please just do what I'm asking you to...\\
41 - I'm older! It was my idea!\\
42 - That is it!\\
43 - Get up!\\
44 - Get back!\\
45 - Come here!\\
46 - Go there!\\
47 - Okay.\\
48 - We are gonna take this picture,\\
49 - and it is gonna be good.\\
50 - And that means no faces,\\
51 - no tongues,\\
52 - no crossed eyes, no bunny ears.\\
53 - We are gonna smile.\\
54 - We are gonna look good.\\
55 - It is gonna cost us $9.99.\\
56 - And all of this is gonna happen\\
57 - by the time I count to three.\\
58 - One, two, three.\\
59 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
60 -     I don't know    \\
61 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
62 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
63 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
64 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
65 -     And you're not so big    \\
66 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
67 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
68 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
69 -     And you're not so big    \\
70 -     Life is unfair.    \\
71 - Hello.\\
72 - Hello?\\
73 - Listen, pervert, this is the third time you've called,\\
74 - and I have just about had it...\\
75 - Is Malcolm...\\
76 - there?\\
77 - Oh. Hi, Stevie.\\
78 - Sorry, uh...\\
79 - Malcolm, phone!\\
80 - Hey, Stevie.\\
81 - You're coming... tonight?\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - And sleeping... over?\\
84 - It's a sleepover, Stevie-- that's what you do.\\
85 - I'm just... excited.\\
86 - Never... had one.\\
87 - We can...\\
88 - read comics...\\
89 - and build...\\
90 - models.\\
91 - Stevie, I never thought I'd say this, but slow down.\\
92 - Ha... ha.\\
93 - Forty-one.\\
94 - Forty-two.\\
95 - Forty-three.\\
96 - Okay, stop, I can't do anymore.\\
97 - You think later on, you can manage to stand\\
98 - on my stomach while I do sit-ups?\\
99 - Ugh, just give me a minute, okay?\\
100 - Finley, what are you doing in the cupboard?\\
101 - Poquito cabeza. Get out of there, man.\\
102 - I can't-- I've been marked by the brothers of the apocalypse.\\
103 - Poquito cabeza.\\
104 - Brothers of the apocalypse?\\
105 - It's ridiculous.\\
106 - It's five seniors with limited imaginations.\\
107 - Oh, yeah, that's easy for you to say.\\
108 - You've got Stanley protecting you.\\
109 - And you're not holding poquito cabeza.\\
110 - Would you stop saying poquito cabeza?\\
111 - I can't.\\
112 - And I'm not coming out.\\
113 - Oh, could you turn in my math homework?\\
114 - These guys are so lame.\\
115 - Amateurs.\\
116 - Poor Finley.\\
117 - He's good at math, right?\\
118 - Finley, boom-ba-yay,\\
119 - Finley, boom-ba-yay,\\
120 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, Finley, boom-ba-yay,\\
121 - Finley, boom-ba-yay...\\
122 - No!\\
123 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, No! No, please!\\
124 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, Somebody help me. No.\\
125 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, Finley, boom... Please, no.\\
126 - Some... Somebody. Stop.\\
127 - Froot Loops.\\
128 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, Oh, please, please.\\
129 - Finley, boom-ba-yay, Help me! Help me!\\
130 - Finley, boom-ba-yay... No...!\\
131 - Hey, Mom, I'm going to Stevie's.\\
132 - You be nice to that boy.\\
133 - He can't walk.\\
134 - If he's got to go to the bathroom\\
135 - in the middle of the night, you get up and you help him.\\
136 - Yes! There's a Chucky movie on tonight.\\
137 - Not in this house.\\
138 - You know how your father feels about evil puppet movies.\\
139 - Please, Mom.\\
140 - It's not even a school night.\\
141 - I can stay up.\\
142 - You really think you're old enough?\\
143 - I totally am.\\
144 - Well, if you really think so.\\
145 - Aw, Mom, no fair.\\
146 - What's the matter?\\
147 - Afraid you can't beat your mommy?\\
148 - She's just a person, she's just a person.\\
149 - Oh, no.\\
150 - He's finally going to win.\\
151 - What's he playing for tonight?\\
152 - Bedtime and a Chucky movie.\\
153 - Stop screwing around and pin him.\\
154 - Oh, you'll have to forgive the mess, Malcolm.\\
155 - Mmm, when our Stevie enters a room, it's like a typhoon hit.\\
156 - Well, uh, we'll leave you alone.\\
157 - Check it out, Stevie.\\
158 - The T. rex is three feet tall with a movable jaw.\\
159 - Red paint for blood.\\
160 - This is so cool.\\
161 - I heard screaming.\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - I said, "This is so cool."\\
164 - Is that a switchblade?\\
165 - It's an X-Acto knife.\\
166 - To cut the pieces apart.\\
167 - I use it all the time.\\
168 - Oh, my goodness.\\
169 - Well, we'll lock this up with the scissors.\\
170 - How about a puzzle?\\
171 - Stevie, it's been a long time\\
172 - since you did the Arc de Triomphe.\\
173 - We'll just give that back when you go home.\\
174 - Hmm.\\
175 - Puzzles are... fun.\\
176 - You think we can order some pizza?\\
177 - Mom's... making... pizza.\\
178 - Cheeseless... sauceless... pizza.\\
179 - That's just bread.\\
180 - Pizza... bread.\\
181 - Wise poquito cabeza.\\
182 - Who shall your next victim be?\\
183 - I am so sick of these guys.\\
184 - What's that?\\
185 - You're not sure?\\
186 - I think we have a winner.\\
187 - You are cordially invited\\
188 - to attend...\\
189 - Hey!\\
190 - I don't have a problem with you.\\
191 - Francis.\\
192 - Look, Stevenson,\\
193 - this place is horrible enough,\\
194 - so the poquito cabeza thing stops now, okay?\\
195 - Just stop...\\
196 - Just stop.\\
197 - Just stop packing.\\
198 - You were protecting me.\\
199 - I mean, I know we don't have, like, a formal agreement\\
200 - or anything, but my act of courage was kind of dependent\\
201 - on your role as my bodyguard.\\
202 - I'm sorry, Francis. You're sorry?\\
203 - Do you have any idea what these guys are gonna do to me?\\
204 - Four words.\\
205 - Nana has a fever.\\
206 - End of discussion.\\
207 - So what am I supposed to do?\\
208 - Remember that move I taught you?\\
209 - Yeah. Don't even try it.\\
210 - Francis, boom-ba-yay, Francis, boom-ba-yay,\\
211 - Francis, boom-ba-yay...\\
212 - Have to admit-- it's kind of catchy.\\
213 - ...Francis, boom-ba-yay.\\
214 - Did you have fun tonight, Malcolm?\\
215 - Yeah, I guess.\\
216 - But isn't it kind of early to be going to bed?\\
217 - It's not even 8:00.\\
218 - Oh, don't worry, that jigsaw puzzle\\
219 - will still be there in the morning.\\
220 - Now, I know you boys want to do\\
221 - a little chatting before sleepy time.\\
222 - Let's say four minutes.\\
223 - Mrs. Kenarban can be a tad strict.\\
224 - She doesn't know that sometimes boys have to be boys.\\
225 - Am I right?\\
226 - I can't move.\\
227 - Welcome to... the club.\\
228 - I'm never gonna fall asleep.\\
229 - It's too early.\\
230 - Want to tell... ghost stories?\\
231 - No, I want to do that dinosaur model.\\
232 - Everything all right in there, boys?\\
233 - Um, yeah.\\
234 - A plush toy just fell on the floor.\\
235 - We're fine.\\
236 - You... can't.\\
237 - I just did.\\
238 - Your parents need to cut you some slack.\\
239 - They just... want me... safe.\\
240 - No, they want you to be four.\\
241 - Stevie, parents aren't allowed to control everything you do.\\
242 - Sometimes, you just have...\\
243 - Sorry.\\
244 - Conditioning.\\
245 - Come on.\\
246 - I got an idea.\\
247 - We're gonna get you out of here.\\
248 - Don't.\\
249 - It's alarmed.\\
250 - You got me? Yeah.\\
251 - You got me?\\
252 - No.\\
253 - I didn't know... you cared.\\
254 - Okay.\\
255 - You want maturity?\\
256 - Well, here's three weeks of social studies homework.\\
257 - Now I'm one week ahead.\\
258 - Plus, I called Grandma.\\
259 - - Hello. - Hi, Grandma, it's Reese.\\
260 - Who is this? Reese. Grandma, it-it's Reese.\\
261 - Who's Reese? Grandma, it's Reese.\\
262 - No, I won't accept charges. It's Reese.\\
263 - I'm trying to sleep. Grandma, come on, it's Reese.\\
264 - I'm very tired, please. Grandma...\\
265 - It goes on like that for another ten minutes,\\
266 - but I still want credit.\\
267 - Honey, I'm very proud of you, but you still haven't proven\\
268 - you're old enough to extend your bedtime.\\
269 - Come on, Mom, I'll do anything.\\
270 - All right.\\
271 - Tell you what.\\
272 - You can stay up and watch the movie, if...\\
273 - ...you put Dewey to bed.\\
274 - Oh.\\
275 - Anything else.\\
276 - That's the deal.\\
277 - You give him his bath, you put him in his PJs,\\
278 - you read him a story.\\
279 - Lois, have a heart.\\
280 - Hey, take it or leave it.\\
281 - I'll take it.\\
282 - Come on, Dewey!\\
283 - It's bath time!\\
284 - You know he doesn't stand a chance.\\
285 - I know, but at least it'll give us the night to be alone.\\
286 - Oh.\\
287 - I love the way your mind works.\\
288 - Honk.\\
289 - Smoothie.\\
290 - I'm... winning.\\
291 - I... lost.\\
292 - Yes.\\
293 - I got... another quarter... in my chair.\\
294 - Somebody stole my friend's wheelchair.\\
295 - What's it look like?\\
296 - It's a chair with wheels.\\
297 - I'll go get a form.\\
298 - I don't need a form, I need a wheelchair.\\
299 - Hey!\\
300 - Come back!\\
301 - I'm not kidding!\\
302 - This ain't funny!\\
303 - I'll get another chair.\\
304 - I'm... screwed.\\
305 - You're not screwed.\\
306 - We just got to get you home.\\
307 - We'll deal with everything else...\\
308 - What are we going to do now?\\
309 - Carry me... like...\\
310 - a backpack.\\
311 - Stop! Stop!\\
312 - Gonna... puke.\\
313 - Ow! Let me go!\\
314 - Come on, Dewey.\\
315 - It's me.\\
316 - You like me.\\
317 - No, I don't.\\
318 - Ow.\\
319 - Dewey, please!\\
320 - How much does my head weigh?\\
321 - Zero.\\
322 - Zero.\\
323 - Hey, do you remember the last time we had\\
324 - a quiet moment together like this?\\
325 - Bob's funeral.\\
326 - Yeah.\\
327 - Oh, that was nice.\\
328 - And you look great in black.\\
329 - Aw...\\
330 - You do. You do.\\
331 - Let the machine get it.\\
332 - Mmm.\\
333 - Mom, Dad, hi.\\
334 - Listen, something's come up.\\
335 - Sorry about the way I sound,\\
336 - but I'm calling from inside a washing machine.\\
337 - Don't worry, I think I'll be fine as long as...\\
338 - Oh. Hi, guys.\\
339 - How's it going?\\
340 - Hey, hey, what are you doing with those quarters?\\
341 - Hey, you guys, you don't want to...\\
342 - Hey, come on...!\\
343 - Morning Dew.\\
344 - You know all my secrets. Mm-hmm.\\
345 - Well, we... we've been together a long time.\\
346 - Ah, well, don't worry.\\
347 - I know all your secrets, too.\\
348 - No, you don't.\\
349 - Oh, yes, I do.\\
350 - No, I'm a man of mystery, Lois.\\
351 - Okay, let's hear one.\\
352 - Let's hear a secret.\\
353 - Well, it's not really a secret as much as it is a fantasy,\\
354 - but it's a little embarrassing, so...\\
355 - Well, so... whisper it in my ear.\\
356 - Ha-ha.\\
357 - Just kidding. Just kidding.\\
358 - Saw it in a movie once.\\
359 - Don't want to do that-- that's...\\
360 - Oh, God.\\
361 - I gotcha.\\
362 - We can do that.\\
363 - Really?\\
364 - Mm-hmm.\\
365 - Dewey, get back here!\\
366 - Okay, I just have to pick up a few things.\\
367 - Give me 20 minutes?\\
368 - I'll be waiting.\\
369 - Yes.\\
370 - Honey? Huh? Huh?\\
371 - Honey, aren't you forgetting something?\\
372 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
373 - Your car keys.\\
374 - Come on, Dewey, stop!\\
375 - Right.\\
376 - Stay out of the neighbor's...\\
377 - That's a nice cart.\\
378 - Thanks.\\
379 - It's new.\\
380 - Downtown... rocks.\\
381 - What's that?\\
382 - A stripped car.\\
383 - What's that?\\
384 - A naked man arguing with a wall.\\
385 - What's that?\\
386 - A nudie bookstore.\\
387 - With my dad coming out of it.\\
388 - There you go.\\
389 - Daddy's gonna get some love tonight.\\
390 - Perhaps you'll survive--\\
391 - perhaps not.\\
392 - Many have perished at the hands of the grand executioner.\\
393 - They are the lucky ones.\\
394 - Are you scared?\\
395 - Actually, now that you mention it... no.\\
396 - What?\\
397 - Scared now?\\
398 - No.\\
399 - I'm just kind of itchy.\\
400 - Huh?\\
401 - You are hanging over a bottomless pit.\\
402 - In five seconds, I will cut the rope.\\
403 - Are you scared now?\\
404 - I'm really not, no.\\
405 - Why not?\\
406 - This stuff is way scary.\\
407 - I'm sorry, it just feels so... amateurish.\\
408 - I mean, I know you guys are trying,\\
409 - but I've been tormented by the best.\\
410 - Let me tell you a little bit about the master.\\
411 - Traveling?!\\
412 - He wasn't traveling.\\
413 - Why don't you put your glasses on here, buddy?\\
414 - You're missing a great game.\\
415 - Oh, oh-oh, you're gonna give me a technical?!\\
416 - You're gonna give me a technical?!\\
417 - You can't give me a technical!\\
418 - Look at that little pee-pee.\\
419 - Oh, Francis, I forgot how tiny you are.\\
420 - Oh-oh, l-l...\\
421 - That's the moment of his birth.\\
422 - You see? See him coming out feet first?\\
423 - Doctor said it was the biggest mucus plug they'd ever seen.\\
424 - It's an eight-inch scratch on the car, Francis!\\
425 - You know how much that's gonna cost to fix?!\\
426 - If you think you are ever, ever borrowing my car again,\\
427 - you are sadly mistaken!\\
428 - And I saw that tattoo, Jimmy!\\
429 - I'm telling your mother!\\
430 - And that's just the stuff I didn't block out.\\
431 - Oh, man.\\
432 - What have we been doing?\\
433 - This was all so wrong.\\
434 - We've got to stop treating people like this.\\
435 - Yeah.\\
436 - If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.\\
437 - You will never amount to anything.\\
438 - Why can't you just apply yourself?\\
439 - Do you enjoy seeing me suffer?\\
440 - Is that what this is?\\
441 - After all that I've done for you,\\
442 - and this is the thanks I get?!\\
443 - We passed... that couch... an hour ago.\\
444 - I know where we're going.\\
445 - Oh, no, I don't.\\
446 - This sucks.\\
447 - You complain... a lot.\\
448 - Well, I'm sorry, but tonight hasn't exactly been\\
449 - the most fun in the world.\\
450 - Not tonight.\\
451 - All the time.\\
452 - You never... stop... bitching.\\
453 - Okay, great.\\
454 - You're gonna do this now? Fine.\\
455 - You were right.\\
456 - We shouldn't have snuck out of your house.\\
457 - We shouldn't have gone to the arcade.\\
458 - It was stupid of me for even thinking about it.\\
459 - It was a dumb idea.\\
460 - No.\\
461 - Good idea.\\
462 - Execution... sucked.\\
463 - Yeah, do it again, man.\\
464 - Come on, do it.\\
465 - Yeah.\\
466 - Your chair. Hey!\\
467 - Oh...\\
468 - I'm slowing... you down.\\
469 - Get them... yourself.\\
470 - Okay.\\
471 - Faster, man, they're gaining on us.\\
472 - Come on! Get out of the chair.\\
473 - Oh, right.\\
474 - You'd better be running!\\
475 - Hey, Stevie, I got your...\\
476 - Oh, my God.\\
477 - Stevie, are you okay?\\
478 - Can't feel... my legs.\\
479 - That's not funny.\\
480 - Is there anything I can do\\
481 - to get out of the ticket, Officer?\\
482 - Just love me.\\
483 - Ah, for crying out loud, Hal, is that it?\\
484 - Well, can't he be a sensitive cop?\\
485 - No! N-No!\\
486 - Th-That puppet's alive!\\
487 - N-No...!\\
488 - Tonight was...\\
489 - awesome.\\
490 - Well, we kind of got lucky.\\
491 - I was... sort of hoping... to get caught.\\
492 - What?\\
493 - Never been... in trouble.\\
494 - Like to see... what it's like.\\
495 - Sometimes you're such a Krelboyne.\\
496 - Oh! I've lost my baby! Oh...\\
497 - I guess... we are... in trouble... after all.\\
498 - Malcolm?\\
499 - My boy!\\
500 - Malcolm...? Just find my boy.\\
501 - Oh, God.\\
502 - Malcolm?
\subsection {Episode 07: Francis Escapes}
1 - Everybody up!\\
2 - Let's go! Let's go!\\
3 - I got to do laundry before work!\\
4 - I am taking breakfast\\
5 - off the table in five minutes!\\
6 - I know this kid...\\
7 - his mom wakes him up with a kiss on the forehead.\\
8 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
9 -     I don't know    \\
10 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     Life is unfair.    \\
20 - Okay, I've been up for half an hour.\\
21 - I've had my cereal.\\
22 - It's time for Mom to ask the same annoying question\\
23 - she asks me every morning.\\
24 - So, Malcolm, what are you doing\\
25 - in your genius class today?\\
26 - Nothing. It's just as dumb and boring\\
27 - as being in regular class, except now I get ostracized.\\
28 - Ostracized? Oh, you're learning such big words.\\
29 - Hey.\\
30 - They want to know what I think\\
31 - about caller I.D. blocking.\\
32 - Do I think about that?\\
33 - Oh!\\
34 - What?\\
35 - Nothing. Just a sharp Cheerio.\\
36 - Oh!\\
37 - Ha! $210!\\
38 - Look at all the calls\\
39 - that Francis is charging to us.\\
40 - 60 minutes. Oh!\\
41 - Oh, 80 minutes-- and every one\\
42 - of these calls is to Beebee.\\
43 - $210 on Beebee!\\
44 - I know. Now, honey,\\
45 - just try to understand, all right?\\
46 - He's-he's off in Alabama.\\
47 - He's all by himself at military school.\\
48 - He's lonely, so... so he calls his little girlfriend.\\
49 - She's a tramp. No one's saying she's not a tramp.\\
50 - I thought you changed our code number.\\
51 - I have, three times.\\
52 - I-I don't know how he's getting it.\\
53 - 65519.\\
54 - That'll be good till the bill comes on the 15th.\\
55 - Thanks, man. You are a good brother.\\
56 - I was taking money out of her wallet anyway.\\
57 - He is doing this\\
58 - just to upset me.\\
59 - Oh, come on, Lois.\\
60 - He's 16 and thinks he's in love.\\
61 - What are you going to do?\\
62 - Oh, man, never ask her that.\\
63 - Beebee, you can't imagine how much I miss you.\\
64 - It is like a white-hot fire burning in my chest.\\
65 - The only thing that keeps me going\\
66 - is just the thought of holding you\\
67 - and stroking your hair\\
68 - and being with you in a perfect, golden moment.\\
69 - Oh, yeah.\\
70 - I'm totally the same way.\\
71 - Oh, I'm just so...\\
72 - Are you watching Buffy?\\
73 - I can do both.\\
74 - You know, I think of things, too, like...\\
75 - no, it's too embarrassing.\\
76 - Tell me.\\
77 - It's not the kind of thing\\
78 - you can say over the phone.\\
79 - It's something I'd have to show you.\\
80 - Beebee, I think it would be better\\
81 - if you told me and then you showed me.\\
82 - Stanley, what are you doing?!\\
83 - That was Beebee!\\
84 - Sorry, man.\\
85 - Commandant says your phone privileges\\
86 - have been revoked for a month.\\
87 - Your mom complained about the bills.\\
88 - Okay, let me just tell her...\\
89 - Francis, do you remember the thumb thing?\\
90 - The one you did to my thumb\\
91 - or the one you did with your thumb?\\
92 - Hello. Malcolm! Thank God.\\
93 - Look, I don't have any more quarters, so just listen.\\
94 - I need you to swipe Mom's credit card\\
95 - and I need you to buy me a cell phone.\\
96 - Now, what you want to get is\\
97 - the unlimited off-peak plan, and then FedEx it to me.\\
98 - Francis, no. I can't do that.\\
99 - What?\\
100 - Dude, don't bail on me.\\
101 - I'm sorry, but Mom is totally on the warpath\\
102 - about the phone calls.\\
103 - Her radar is up. I can't do\\
104 - anything.\\
105 - Seriously, you just got to find a way to live\\
106 - without calling Beebee all the time.\\
107 - Hello?\\
108 - Hello?\\
109 - He understands, right?\\
110 - Dearest Beebee, something wonderful has happened.\\
111 - The pain and confusion of the last few months\\
112 - has disappeared, replaced by a single\\
113 - glorious purpose.\\
114 - From the ashes of the old Francis rises a new man,\\
115 - filled with boldness and determination.\\
116 - I fly to you on angel's wings,\\
117 - knowing I follow the mandate of my heart.\\
118 - Every night for the past two weeks,\\
119 - he thinks there's a monster under the bed.\\
120 - It seemed so funny when we thought of it.\\
121 - Oh, sweetie, not again.\\
122 - The monster!\\
123 - It tried to suck my brain out!\\
124 - All right, I have had it.\\
125 - You two are banned from Nintendo.\\
126 - Okay.\\
127 - We're already banned from Nintendo.\\
128 - The sad thing is he thinks he just outsmarted her.\\
129 - All right, fine.\\
130 - Pillows.\\
131 - What?\\
132 - That's right. I'm taking your pillows.\\
133 - Come on, come on, hand 'em over.\\
134 - And I'm not getting up again.\\
135 - If that monster wants to suck out your brain,\\
136 - you just let him take it and you go back to sleep.\\
137 - I love you.\\
138 - I love you.\\
139 - I love you.\\
140 - I love you.\\
141 - Hello?\\
142 - Don't scream. It's me.\\
143 - Francis!\\
144 - Way to go, dipwad.\\
145 - You got me in the nards.\\
146 - Francis, what are you doing here?\\
147 - I'm taking control of my own destiny.\\
148 - I'm just here to pick up Beebee, and then we're\\
149 - going to head off for Canada.\\
150 - You're going to visit Grandma?\\
151 - No, a different part of Canada.\\
152 - Someplace wild where people don't have to destroy love\\
153 - just 'cause they don't understand it.\\
154 - You just ran away from school?\\
155 - Mom's really going to kill you now.\\
156 - No, she won't, because she won't know.\\
157 - Malcolm, you can't tell anybody.\\
158 - I'm placing my life in your hands here.\\
159 - Did you roll around in something?\\
160 - You'll get used to it.\\
161 - Look, I need you to get Beebee\\
162 - to come see me tonight, okay?\\
163 - Give her this.\\
164 - Let it air out for a while first.\\
165 - Try to get me some food,\\
166 - 'cause I haven't eaten in, like, 36 hours.\\
167 - Francis, this sounds kind of drastic, even for you.\\
168 - Malcolm, I do not have time for doubt!\\
169 - The die has been cast, my future is set.\\
170 - Now, there's one question in my mind:\\
171 - can I trust you?\\
172 - But...\\
173 - Can I trust you?\\
174 - Yes.\\
175 - Yeah, definitely.\\
176 - I'll toss my lunch bag over the fence before school.\\
177 - Oh!\\
178 - Mmm!\\
179 - Can I have some?\\
180 - Can't.\\
181 - It's a...\\
182 - prescription... sandwich.\\
183 - "Prescription sandwich"?\\
184 - Stevie, that's not even a good lie.\\
185 - If you don't want to share, just say so.\\
186 - Don't want...\\
187 - to share.\\
188 - Let's play\\
189 - Ironside.\\
190 - I'll be... Ironside.\\
191 - I don't want to play stupid Ironside.\\
192 - What's your... problem?\\
193 - It's my brother Francis.\\
194 - He escaped from military school\\
195 - and hitchhiked all the way here.\\
196 - And he's all scraped up and smelly and hungry and dirty,\\
197 - and now he's hiding out at the creek.\\
198 - If my parents catch him, he's dead.\\
199 - He's talking like he's crazy.\\
200 - I don't know what to do.\\
201 - Squeal.\\
202 - What?\\
203 - Squeal.\\
204 - Rat him out.\\
205 - I can't do that.\\
206 - He's my brother.\\
207 - I promised him.\\
208 - I can't tell anybody.\\
209 - You told... me.\\
210 - Yeah, but by the time you tell anyone,\\
211 - he'll be a thousand miles from here.\\
212 - Tou... ch  .\\
213 - Beebee?\\
214 - What?\\
215 - Oh, you're, uh, that kid.\\
216 - My name's Malcolm.\\
217 - I'm Francis's brother.\\
218 - You met me, like, ten times.\\
219 - Yeah, you're the freaky little brain, right?\\
220 - Just be cool.\\
221 - What do you want?\\
222 - Here.\\
223 - Francis is back home.\\
224 - Well, he's not home. He's hiding.\\
225 - Huh. Three pages?\\
226 - Both sides.\\
227 - He loves to make me read.\\
228 - What's that word?\\
229 - "Consummate."\\
230 - It means he likes you.\\
231 - Oh.\\
232 - "Assignation, rendezvous, tryst"?\\
233 - How the hell is anyone supposed to know what he's talking about?\\
234 - Beebee, just meet him at the creek at 7:30, okay?\\
235 - See? You can say it in English, and you're, like, ten.\\
236 - What are you doing?!\\
237 - I'm wearing a tank top.\\
238 - Beebee, I don't...\\
239 - Don't think.\\
240 - Just walk. Go.\\
241 - The worst part is, I think I'm stealing panty liners.\\
242 - Gosh, I had such a good day at work today.\\
243 - I got to work the cash-only line\\
244 - for the first time in a month,\\
245 - and my register came out to the penny.\\
246 - Plus, that creepy new assistant manager\\
247 - sliced his hand open with a box cutter.\\
248 - Spent the whole afternoon in the emergency room.\\
249 - Here's to him.\\
250 - Honey, this chicken is absolutely delicious.\\
251 - Oh, well, it's a little recipe I came up with.\\
252 - It's Shake n' Bake-- but for pork.\\
253 - How about that?\\
254 - That's one for the recipe box.\\
255 - Let's call it, uh, "chork."\\
256 - All in favor?\\
257 - No one for "picken"?\\
258 - Chork it is.\\
259 - Brava.\\
260 - Oh, cut it out.\\
261 - You big talker.\\
262 - Will this make me\\
263 - taste better to the monsters?\\
264 - Sure it will, son.\\
265 - Get out of here! You're not eating it.\\
266 - You haven't had a bite in two minutes, I counted.\\
267 - I'm saving it.\\
268 - There is no saving.\\
269 - Malcolm, he's right.\\
270 - The rule is: no saving.\\
271 - Oh, yeah, I care. Cut it out!\\
272 - Come on, it's mine.\\
273 - Get out of here! No!\\
274 - Give it back! Boys, boys, stop it.\\
275 - You're going get your mother out of...\\
276 - uh, you're going to ruin her nice day.\\
277 - Francis did what?!\\
278 - Another night in the chat room.\\
279 - That kid! That kid!\\
280 - He thinks he can just run away from school\\
281 - like some-some kind of escaped convict?\\
282 - Well, if he thinks he can just vanish\\
283 - in the night and I won't find him,\\
284 - well, he is sadly mistaken.\\
285 - Lois, you just calm down.\\
286 - There's nothing we can do right now.\\
287 - Yes, there is. I can call the police.\\
288 - No, they're not going to look for anybody\\
289 - unless they've been missing for 48 hours.\\
290 - Not if I say he has drugs on him.\\
291 - Lois, stop it.\\
292 - Now, you're just going to have to accept the fact\\
293 - that for now, this is beyond your control.\\
294 - Francis is going to have to sink or swim on his own,\\
295 - and frankly, I don't think that's such a bad thing.\\
296 - And in the meantime, we just have to leave it up to fate.\\
297 - Oh. "Fate."\\
298 - "Fate" is just what you call it when you don't know the name\\
299 - of the person screwing you over!\\
300 - Mom, I'm sure he's okay.\\
301 - Uh-oh, tactical error.\\
302 - Why do you think he's okay, son?\\
303 - Because... he's always okay.\\
304 - Malcolm,\\
305 - this is a very serious situation here,\\
306 - and, well, I know you love Francis as much as we do,\\
307 - so if you have\\
308 - any idea...\\
309 - Oh, for God's sake! Where is he?!\\
310 - He came here to see Beebee! He's meeting her tonight!\\
311 - Oh, my God, how'd she do that?\\
312 - I knew it.\\
313 - When did you talk to him?\\
314 - Don't look at her eyes, don't look at her...\\
315 - This morning!\\
316 - And Dewey shoved a sandwich in the VCR!\\
317 - Malcolm, where is he?\\
318 - Got to think.\\
319 - Diversion. Delancey.\\
320 - Delancey Park!\\
321 - He's meeting her at Delancey Park\\
322 - by the soccer field.\\
323 - Well...\\
324 - we'll just see what fate has in store for Francis.\\
325 - Francis, I have to tell you...\\
326 - Is Beebee coming? Yeah.\\
327 - But I have to tell you something first.\\
328 - I ratted you out to Mom. What?!\\
329 - I didn't mean to.\\
330 - Mom did... her eyes.\\
331 - And her voice, it was...\\
332 - I didn't mean to!\\
333 - Malcolm, how could you do that? I trusted you.\\
334 - I know.\\
335 - I'm sorry.\\
336 - Look, I sent her to the park.\\
337 - You've got an hour to get out of here\\
338 - and have a head start before she...\\
339 - Are you crazy? I can't go anywhere.\\
340 - Beebee's coming. Beebee.\\
341 - Francis, what's wrong with you?\\
342 - Why are you getting in so much trouble for her?\\
343 - You don't understand.\\
344 - Duh! No one understands.\\
345 - She's not nice, she's not smart,\\
346 - she's a thief, she's not even that good-looking.\\
347 - And, oh, guess what else.\\
348 - She treats you like crap!\\
349 - I know.\\
350 - You do?\\
351 - Of course I do.\\
352 - There's something you don't know about Beebee.\\
353 - What?\\
354 - That no one in her whole life\\
355 - has ever loved her the way that I do.\\
356 - All she has to do is see that and everything will change.\\
357 - I really thought he had something better.\\
358 - Look, Malcolm, you'll understand when you're older.\\
359 - Now, just go.\\
360 - What were you doing?\\
361 - Nothing. Mind your own business.\\
362 - Who were you talking to?\\
363 - I wasn't talking to anybody. You're imagining it.\\
364 - I heard you talking.\\
365 - Okay, I'll tell you.\\
366 - But you have to keep it a secret.\\
367 - You know the monster under your bed?\\
368 - It's called a Sasquatch.\\
369 - He hunts back there during the day.\\
370 - I was throwing him some raw meat\\
371 - so he wouldn't come get us tonight.\\
372 - I don't think I gave him enough.\\
373 - So, if I were you, I'd keep very quiet\\
374 - and stay the hell out of there.\\
375 - Get it?\\
376 - Move!\\
377 - Francis?\\
378 - Beebee?\\
379 - Francis?\\
380 - Oh. Don't move.\\
381 - I want to remember this forever.\\
382 - Where are you?\\
383 - No! Don't look at me!\\
384 - I wanted so much to be perfect for you,\\
385 - but I couldn't find any soap.\\
386 - I'm hideous.\\
387 - Really? Yes.\\
388 - But it's okay.\\
389 - Everything is okay now that we're together.\\
390 - I can't tell you how beautiful you look at this moment.\\
391 - You look like an angel or a perfect dawn\\
392 - or a galaxy of stars.\\
393 - I don't think we should see each other anymore.\\
394 - And... my heart soars when I think of...\\
395 - Did you hear what I said?\\
396 - I... um...\\
397 - What?\\
398 - Look...\\
399 - you're a nice guy,\\
400 - and all those letters you sent-- the stuff I understood, anyway--\\
401 - was sweet, but I don't know.\\
402 - Feels different now.\\
403 - It's hard to explain.\\
404 - Would you try?\\
405 - Well, maybe I just like the long-distance thing\\
406 - 'cause, you know, you'd call and you'd talk\\
407 - and you'd make me feel so good about myself\\
408 - and I didn't have to do anything.\\
409 - Yeah, that's it.\\
410 - Beebee, please.\\
411 - I just think it's better we end it now\\
412 - before anybody gets hurt.\\
413 - I'm sorry, Francis.\\
414 - Ow.\\
415 - Ow!\\
416 - Ow!\\
417 - Ow!\\
418 - Get out of here!\\
419 - You stupid, dumb monster!\\
420 - This is my house!\\
421 - Ow. Go away!\\
422 - Ow!\\
423 - You leave me alone!\\
424 - Ow! Ow!\\
425 - You! You, there!\\
426 - What do you think you're doing?\\
427 - Excuse me?\\
428 - Do you know how dumb and careless you're being?\\
429 - Well, I brought...\\
430 - Oh, for God's sake, I'm not talking about that.\\
431 - But shame on you.\\
432 - Don't you know how this is all going to end?\\
433 - Do we know you?\\
434 - No, but I know you.\\
435 - You're young and pretty\\
436 - and you love to get 16-year-old boys so twisted up\\
437 - they don't know what they're doing.\\
438 - And you think it's all in fun. You'll move on.\\
439 - You don't care how bad you hurt him.\\
440 - Let me tell you something, young lady.\\
441 - Hearts are precious things.\\
442 - You should be careful with them.\\
443 - You!\\
444 - You there!\\
445 - What do you think you're doing?!\\
446 - And then the monster started growling at me,\\
447 - so I threw rocks at him and I killed him.\\
448 - And then he started flying around on rocket boots,\\
449 - and I got to ride inside his head,\\
450 - and now the monster's my friend, and we went...\\
451 - and we went to get Slurpees.\\
452 - You did not! You're just lying!\\
453 - Reese, if that's what Dewey says happened,\\
454 - there's no reason to argue about it.\\
455 - No one believes I beat the last level of Mortal Kombat.\\
456 - Because that's just ridiculous.\\
457 - No one beats Sub-Zero.\\
458 - Leave it off.\\
459 - So, Beebee broke up with me.\\
460 - Oh.\\
461 - You okay?\\
462 - I think I'm fine.\\
463 - There's a strange sense of peace that comes over you\\
464 - when you give up that last shred of dignity.\\
465 - It's nice.\\
466 - I'm really sorry.\\
467 - Well, if you're going to love women,\\
468 - you have to expect the occasional flaming wipeout.\\
469 - It's in the fine print,\\
470 - but you agree to it when you sign up.\\
471 - So what are you going to do?\\
472 - I'm going to go back to school.\\
473 - I only missed a day, so it shouldn't be too bad.\\
474 - There's a pack of farm girls\\
475 - that hang around outside the fence.\\
476 - Probably check that out.\\
477 - Later days.\\
478 - Wait.\\
479 - I'm sorry I ratted you out.\\
480 - I just got scared.\\
481 - Dude, it's ancient history.\\
482 - Don't worry about it.\\
483 - Well, can't you at least hit me or something,\\
484 - just so I feel like we're even?\\
485 - You want me to hit you?\\
486 - I don't know. Yeah.\\
487 - Okay.\\
488 - Thanks.\\
489 - Psych.\\
490 - Ow!\\
491 - Now we're even.\\
492 - Ow!\\
493 -     Don't cry    \\
494 -     Dry those tears falling out of your eyes    \\
495 -     Don't cry...    \\
496 - How'd you find me?\\
497 - Malcolm told me.\\
498 - You know, you should probably rethink the whole\\
499 - "trusting him with secrets" thing.\\
500 - How mad is Mom?\\
501 - Well, let's just try to get a couple states behind us\\
502 - before we ask her.\\
503 - So, how'd it go with Beebee?\\
504 - We broke up.\\
505 - Does it hurt?\\
506 - Oh, yeah.\\
507 - Well, son...\\
508 - you know, I wish I could say it gets easier,\\
509 - but... I honestly don't know.\\
510 - I've never been dumped.\\
511 - Hmm.\\
512 -     Don't cry.    
\subsection {Episode 08: Krelboyne Picnic}
1 - Let me go!\\
2 - Get off it!\\
3 - I can't breathe!\\
4 - Ow!\\
5 - Leave the squirrel alone\\
6 - and get the fire extinguisher.\\
7 - Reese, no!\\
8 - Blood tastes funny.\\
9 - You better be naked when I get back.\\
10 - Done.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - Malcolm.\\
24 - Malcolm.\\
25 - How was that even remotely fair?!\\
26 - That's for us all having to go\\
27 - to your stupid Krelboyne picnic today.\\
28 - You think I want you to go?\\
29 - My special class is having a family day,\\
30 - and if that's not bad enough,\\
31 - it's on the weekend that Francis is home.\\
32 - I'm going to look like a total idiot in front of him.\\
33 - Pretty bunnies.\\
34 - Pretty bunnies.\\
35 - Luckily, I've got a brilliant plan to get out of this.\\
36 - Oh, poor baby.\\
37 - Yeah, I'm sick.\\
38 - No, you're grounded for pouring\\
39 - perfectly good vegetable soup in the toilet.\\
40 - And you owe me 49 cents.\\
41 - I don't understand why you don't want to go\\
42 - to this picnic, Malcolm; I think it sounds like fun.\\
43 - Yeah, sitting on the grass, eating barbecue.\\
44 - It's Krelboynes.\\
45 - It's not going to be on the grass\\
46 - because half the class is allergic.\\
47 - And don't expect any meat, either,\\
48 - because they all voted not to serve anything\\
49 - that ever had a mother.\\
50 - Cousin Nancy doesn't have a mother.\\
51 - That's right. She has two daddies.\\
52 - Oh, man, two guys as your parents?\\
53 - That house has got to be a dude's paradise.\\
54 - You know,\\
55 - there are a lot of proven health benefits\\
56 - to the vegetarian lifestyle.\\
57 - In fact, I've been seriously\\
58 - considering it myself.\\
59 - It'll be nice to meet the other parents.\\
60 - I'm sure they're much better\\
61 - than those carnival freaks in Reese's class.\\
62 - What a horrible bunch of people.\\
63 - Amen to that.\\
64 - Well, this just sounds like a blast to me.\\
65 - Why do I have to go, again?\\
66 - Because it's a family picnic, Francis,\\
67 - and you're a member of this family.\\
68 - Oh, right, see, I just keep forgetting that,\\
69 - being forced to live a thousand miles away\\
70 - at military school and all.\\
71 - Well, I can't wait to see this academic circus.\\
72 - I bet it's really cute. It's not a circus.\\
73 - It's a bunch of social misfits doing a bunch of weird stunts\\
74 - to show off how smart they are.\\
75 - What's your weird stunt, honey?\\
76 - Just some lame thing-- nothing you want to see.\\
77 - You've got to get me out of there\\
78 - before my turn comes.\\
79 - Why? What's the big deal?\\
80 - It just is, okay?\\
81 - I don't want to do my act.\\
82 - All right, relax.\\
83 - We'll hang out for, like, 15 minutes,\\
84 - establish your presence.\\
85 - Then we'll go over the fence, like at Grandma's wedding.\\
86 - That's why I love this guy.\\
87 - Welcome!\\
88 - Welcome one and all!\\
89 - Run away with us and join the circus!\\
90 - The academic circus!\\
91 - Oh, no.\\
92 - My teacher.\\
93 - Malcolm, thank goodness.\\
94 - I was so nervous.\\
95 - I had a dream you didn't come, and I was\\
96 - being chased by something big but invisible and...\\
97 - Never mind.\\
98 - You're here, and that's all that matters.\\
99 - Hello, little guy.\\
100 - Ready to leave your family and join the circus?\\
101 - Oh. Huh?\\
102 - Little lower, son.\\
103 - Oh, look at all your little friends.\\
104 - Hi.\\
105 - Hi, there.\\
106 - They're not my friends.\\
107 - They're a bunch of geeks and losers.\\
108 - Malcolm's in the house!\\
109 - Malcolm! Malcolm!\\
110 - Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm!\\
111 - I'm going to kick so much Krelboyne ass today,\\
112 - it's not even funny.\\
113 - Go, Malcolm! Go, Malcolm! Go, Malcolm!\\
114 - Easy.\\
115 - You got all afternoon.\\
116 - We're getting out of here in 15 minutes, right?\\
117 - Make it ten.\\
118 - Yeah.\\
119 - Ooh, hello.\\
120 - And who might you be?\\
121 - What?\\
122 - Nothing.\\
123 - Hello. I'm Lois. This is Hal.\\
124 - We're Malcolm's parents.\\
125 - That's very nice.\\
126 - I'm Dorene. These are the girls.\\
127 - Hello, it's nice to meet you all.\\
128 - Yeah, it's really...\\
129 - ...whatever.\\
130 - Hope everybody likes brownies.\\
131 - Oh, my, that is so thoughtful.\\
132 - Are those nuts? Walnuts.\\
133 - Oh, gee, we can't have that.\\
134 - Some of the children are severely allergic to nuts.\\
135 - Oh, my gosh, I had no idea. Whose child is allergic?\\
136 - Well, no one in this class specifically,\\
137 - but you can never be too careful.\\
138 - Believe me, this isn't meant to publicly humiliate you.\\
139 - I'm sure they were delicious.\\
140 - Oh, hi-ya, fellas.\\
141 - Hey, there.\\
142 - What's your pleasure-- nature dog,\\
143 - health patty, tofu square?\\
144 - Good God.\\
145 - Want me to brown that chicken leg a little more for you?\\
146 - Well...\\
147 - looks like I got here just in time.\\
148 - Gentlemen...\\
149 - behold.\\
150 - Is that... meat?\\
151 - Nothing but.\\
152 - Hi.\\
153 - Hey.\\
154 - So, uh... you here?\\
155 - Yeah.\\
156 - You?\\
157 - Yeah.\\
158 - Hey, Stevie.\\
159 - Can't stop... to chat.\\
160 - Got to get... my chemicals...\\
161 - in the shade.\\
162 - I thought you were doing your report on oscilloscopes.\\
163 - Changed to... catalytics.\\
164 - It's more... exciting.\\
165 - Right?\\
166 - What do you care?\\
167 - I'm up... after you.\\
168 - So?\\
169 - Following you...\\
170 - is like...\\
171 - following Streisand.\\
172 - Well, don't worry about it.\\
173 - You won't be following me.\\
174 - Why?\\
175 - Have I been... bumped?\\
176 - Francis, what are you doing?!\\
177 - Come on, the coast is clear and...\\
178 - It's already been ten minutes and...\\
179 - We're not ditching out, are we?\\
180 - A small pack of Krelboynes has ventured out of hiding\\
181 - to bask in the afternoon sun.\\
182 - Their defenses down,\\
183 - they're an easy target for nearby predators.\\
184 - They sense danger, but it is too late.\\
185 - Their hesitation is fatal.\\
186 - And the circle of life goes on.\\
187 - Kafkaesque, isn't it?\\
188 - Huh?\\
189 - Never mind.\\
190 - Kick his butt, Alphonse.\\
191 - Wait... wait.\\
192 - Here it comes.\\
193 - Yes, there!\\
194 - I've arrested the cellular mitosis!\\
195 - Thank you, Dabney.\\
196 - That was riveting.\\
197 - Our next act needs no introduction,\\
198 - having been the buzz of last year's math fair.\\
199 - Please welcome Flora Mayesh\\
200 - and Fermat's Last Theorem!\\
201 - Hello? Is this...?\\
202 - Testing.\\
203 - So, I understand that Malcolm has quite the vocabulary.\\
204 - Yeah, he's just yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, all day long.\\
205 - Well, that's not the vocabulary I meant.\\
206 - It seems that he's taught\\
207 - several of the children the "R" word.\\
208 - The "R" word?\\
209 - I'm sure it's just something he picked up off the street--\\
210 - certainly not at home.\\
211 - Yeah, well, "R" you, lady.\\
212 - So, this is going well, right?\\
213 - It's pretty much everything I expected.\\
214 - So, you ready, Malcolm?\\
215 - I mean, you're all set, right?\\
216 - Sure.\\
217 - Good.\\
218 - I'm... ready.\\
219 - Thanks for... asking.\\
220 - You know what's so great about our relationship?\\
221 - It just still feels so fresh, you know what I mean?\\
222 - Totally.\\
223 - All right, take it away.\\
224 - I need two burgers and a dog, Hal.\\
225 - Coming up. Dewey?\\
226 - Thank you, sir.\\
227 - All right. Thank you.\\
228 - What have I told you about raw meat, son?\\
229 - I'm not.\\
230 - Dad, I want you to meet someone.\\
231 - This is Jody. Hi.\\
232 - Oh, it's so great to finally meet you.\\
233 - Francis talks about you all the time.\\
234 - Oh, yeah?\\
235 - You, too.\\
236 - I'm so glad that went well.\\
237 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
238 - I give to you the Nixon electromagnet.\\
239 - This is going dreadfully.\\
240 - Am I wrong?\\
241 - Please tell me I'm wrong.\\
242 - Excuse me.\\
243 - For what?\\
244 - This is it.\\
245 - You're almost... up.\\
246 - Stop reminding me.\\
247 - Nervous?\\
248 - No, I just don't want to do this.\\
249 - Don't you ever get sick of being a Krelboyne?\\
250 - Of people thinking you're some kind of freak?\\
251 - You are...\\
252 - what you are.\\
253 - Accept it.\\
254 - Not without a fight.\\
255 - You're harshing... my buzz.\\
256 - Don't let... anyone...\\
257 - mess with... my stuff.\\
258 - You know, in the wrong hands,\\
259 - these chemicals can make a pretty powerful stink bomb.\\
260 - These hands look wrong enough.\\
261 - And this field trip to the historic ghost town,\\
262 - I think we all know what that leads to--\\
263 - the occult, devil worship,\\
264 - state colleges.\\
265 - So, then, it's agreed\\
266 - that the trip will be canceled.\\
267 - Wait a minute-- you can't decide that.\\
268 - You didn't even vote.\\
269 - I was only going by the general tone\\
270 - of the group.\\
271 - General tone?\\
272 - I haven't heard a peep\\
273 - out of any of these other women all day.\\
274 - What, you all agree\\
275 - with what Mrs. Control Freak here is saying?\\
276 - Well...\\
277 - Phyllis!\\
278 - My name isn't Phyllis!\\
279 - And... no, I don't feel that way.\\
280 - - I don't either! - I never liked...\\
281 - My husband told me I should stand up to you\\
282 - after I came home from that bake sale in tears.\\
283 - My soy burger...\\
284 - it's bleeding!\\
285 - This is meat!\\
286 - We're eating meat!\\
287 - Oh, my God!\\
288 - We're eating meat!\\
289 - Get out of the way!\\
290 - Come here!\\
291 - Okay, the difference between a stink bomb\\
292 - and a level-three toxic biohazard\\
293 - is apparently two extra drops of sulfur tetra-oxide.\\
294 - I'm totally suing that Web site.\\
295 - I didn't do it! I didn't do it!\\
296 - Where are you, honey?\\
297 - I want... our seat.\\
298 - I'm kind of conflicted.\\
299 - On the one hand, I ruined Caroline's picnic\\
300 - and very possibly endangered a hundred lives.\\
301 - On the other hand, now I don't have to do my act.\\
302 - Did you miss me?\\
303 - Mm-hmm.\\
304 - So who was that girl with her hands all over you?\\
305 - What girl, the paramedic?\\
306 - She was making sure I didn't inhale any toxic fumes.\\
307 - Oh, I'm sure you loved every moment of it.\\
308 - God, would you quit nagging me?\\
309 - Well, maybe if you paid a little more attention to me.\\
310 - More attention?\\
311 - You're smothering me.\\
312 - I need space.\\
313 - Oh, you'll get your space.\\
314 - We're through.\\
315 - Fine by me.\\
316 - Here's the school ring you gave me.\\
317 - The teddy bear key chain.\\
318 - Your shirt. Your two poems.\\
319 - The book you lent me.\\
320 - Your Depeche Mode tape!\\
321 - Oh, and here's your gum.\\
322 - I love Krelboynes.\\
323 - And I swear, I'm not just saying that.\\
324 - Why would I?\\
325 - Nice hang time.\\
326 - Well, it's really a simple function\\
327 - of the tensile strength of the elastic waistband.\\
328 - I brought you a hamburger.\\
329 - This should make us even, right?\\
330 - Thank you.\\
331 - Is this meat?\\
332 - Uh, it might be.\\
333 - Look what I've been reduced to.\\
334 - Okay, well, um...\\
335 - I'm going to...\\
336 - Oh, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.\\
337 - Huh?\\
338 - I know how much\\
339 - you were looking forward to doing your act...\\
340 - especially with your family here.\\
341 - I failed you.\\
342 - No, you didn't.\\
343 - Yes, I did.\\
344 - After today, they're going to fire my ass so fast.\\
345 - My parents were right.\\
346 - I never should have left the cannery.\\
347 - Want another hamburger?\\
348 - Yes!\\
349 - I do. I do.\\
350 - I really do.\\
351 - Can you believe it? Meat.\\
352 - I don't know about you, but I'm outraged.\\
353 - I want you to know that I am going to see to it\\
354 - that you never serve on a school committee,\\
355 - hold an office or even so much as set foot\\
356 - in a PTA meeting as long as I can help it.\\
357 - Is that a promise, lady?\\
358 - 'Cause I'd really like to get that in writing.\\
359 - I should have expected as much\\
360 - from the mother of a foul-mouth thug.\\
361 - What he's even doing in this class, I don't know.\\
362 - Oh, I see you made a friend.\\
363 - Yeah. Tomorrow we're going shopping for shoes.\\
364 - Oh.\\
365 - Academic circus?\\
366 - Well, you certainly got the circus part right.\\
367 - This is the biggest debacle I've ever seen.\\
368 - I guarantee you Principal Littledove\\
369 - is going to hear about this.\\
370 - Exactly. He sure will, from all of us.\\
371 - Can I ask you a question?\\
372 - Yes. All women suck.\\
373 - No, I mean... you'd still like me\\
374 - even if you found out I was a freak, right?\\
375 - And the family wouldn't treat me any different, right?\\
376 - Dude, we already know you're smart.\\
377 - Yeah, but...\\
378 - Never mind.\\
379 - Just don't say I didn't warn you.\\
380 - Look, it's Malcolm!\\
381 - Hey, hey, Malcolm's going to do it, guys!\\
382 - The PTA is online, missy.\\
383 - Are you aware of the power of the Internet?\\
384 - Hey, everyone, look!\\
385 - Look, Malcolm's doing it. He's doing it.\\
386 - Hey, shut the hell up!\\
387 - Um...\\
388 - could somebody please show me some credit cards?\\
389 - Okay.\\
390 - The numbers on them are:\\
391 - 3699-7412-6823-\\
392 - 9140 and... 3424-\\
393 - 1804-1835-3668.\\
394 - He's right!\\
395 - Okay.\\
396 - If you add the individual digits on each card,\\
397 - you get 74 and 66.\\
398 - If you multiply those numbers, you get 4,884.\\
399 - How do we even know he's right?\\
400 - Oh, he's right.\\
401 - 4,884 squared\\
402 - is 23,853,456.\\
403 - The square root of 4,884\\
404 - is 69 and 885/1,000.\\
405 - The square root of that is eight and 3,597/10,000.\\
406 - Factor it!\\
407 - The factors are 232 and 73.\\
408 - Multiply it by pi.\\
409 - 26 and 261/1,000.\\
410 - Cube it! 584 and 214/1,000.\\
411 - What's the arc tangent?\\
412 - 89 and 9/10 degrees.\\
413 - Natural log! 6 and 3,699/10,000.\\
414 - What's the reciprocal? 17/10,000.\\
415 - In base eight!\\
416 - 11,431.\\
417 - What's the capitol of Iceland?\\
418 - Reykjavik-- but that's not math.\\
419 - Why can't you do that?\\
420 - Cellular mitosis.\\
421 - What are we paying your tutor for?\\
422 - Do you have any brothers?\\
423 - No.\\
424 - Hey.\\
425 - Hi.\\
426 - So, um... how you been?\\
427 - Fine.\\
428 - You look good.\\
429 - Yes, it was.\\
430 - It was a wonderful circus.\\
431 - So many people were worried...\\
432 - Was it as bad as I think it was?\\
433 - Man... you killed.\\
434 - That's what I was afraid of.\\
435 - Sorry you didn't get to do your act.\\
436 - Shove... the sympathy...\\
437 - showboat.\\
438 - He fell on his butt and everything.\\
439 - He was just, like, dazed.\\
440 - Is Malcolm a robot?\\
441 - No, son, he's just smart.\\
442 - Very, very,\\
443 - very, very, very, very smart.\\
444 - Hey, Malcolm...\\
445 - How many fingers am I holding up?\\
446 - Shut up.\\
447 - Analyze what I had for lunch.\\
448 - Get off me, you moron.\\
449 - You know what I don't understand?\\
450 - How you can rattle off all those numbers,\\
451 - but you can't remember to brush your teeth.\\
452 - Hey, who's for Burger Barn?\\
453 - Burger Barn! Burger Barn! Burger Barn!

15 - "Five across.\\
16 - My mother the... blank."\\
17 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
18 -     I don't know    \\
19 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\

25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     Life is unfair.    \\
29 - I know a lot of kids say they like school,\\
30 - but honestly, I just find it exhausting.\\
31 - I mean, when I am in school, I'm either bored, terrified...\\
32 - ...or confused about Julie Houlerman.\\
33 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
34 - Perfect example.\\
35 - What does she mean by that?\\
36 - Is it just "hi"?\\
37 - Is she trying to say she likes me?\\
38 - Is she just being nice?\\
39 - And now I have to figure out a secret way to answer her\\
40 - without A) acting like I like her,\\
41 - or B) acting like I don't like her,\\
42 - or C) acting like I've never thought about A or B.\\
43 - Just be pleasant but noncommittal.\\
44 - Hey, Jul...\\
45 - She's doing this to me on purpose.\\
46 - Hey, how are you?\\
47 - Stanley, you are incredible.\\
48 - I thought Malcolm was a genius, but this is off the charts.\\
49 - The school asked for an honor guard.\\
50 - I figured you'd like a few weeks without drill practice.\\
51 - A pageant, though.\\
52 - Beautiful girls with self-esteem issues.\\
53 - It's perfect.\\
54 - Easy. Let's start with the obvious runners-up.\\
55 - They're going to be the neediest.\\
56 - You know, uh, this is a little intense.\\
57 - You, me, working this shelf... together.\\
58 - What's intense about it?\\
59 - I guess nothing.\\
60 - Excuse me.\\
61 - Mom!\\
62 - You're not supposed to yell in the store.\\
63 - Not supposed to do that either.\\
64 - Life's funny that way.\\
65 - Hey... the Three Musketeers.\\
66 - Athos, Aramis...\\
67 - and you must be Porthos.\\
68 - You're creepy.\\
69 - You really shouldn't say hurtful things to grown-ups.\\
70 - I'm sorry.\\
71 - That's okay. We're still friends.\\
72 - Craig...\\
73 - you have got to redo the nail polish.\\
74 - The crystal pinks are mixed with the frosty pinks\\
75 - are mixed with the God knows what.\\
76 - Right away, Mr. Pinter.\\
77 - Okay. I'm off work in five minutes.\\
78 - Don't touch the register.\\
79 - Don't touch the candy, don't touch the price tags\\
80 - and don't touch the microphones.\\
81 - And that includes by accident.\\
82 - That includes just looking.\\
83 - That includes hovering\\
84 - with your finger a half inch away from it.\\
85 - Fair warning.\\
86 - Dare you.\\
87 - Go ahead.\\
88 - You do it.\\
89 - I'll do it. Yeah, right.\\
90 - I will.\\
91 - This isn't baby stuff, Dewey.\\
92 - Yeah, go ride the horsey out front.\\
93 - Horsey.\\
94 - I got to remember that.\\
95 - The microphone, register...\\
96 - candy... price tags...\\
97 - steam cleaner.\\
98 - Boys!\\
99 - It's not what it looks like!\\
100 - Oh, hello, boys.\\
101 - How long you in for?\\
102 - Another hour.\\
103 - Yow.\\
104 - Hi, hon.\\
105 - Hi.\\
106 - Did you see Dewey outside?\\
107 - Oh, what's wrong?\\
108 - I don't know, but something's upsetting him.\\
109 - He didn't say a word on the way home,\\
110 - and now I just can't find him anywhere.\\
111 - Hmm.\\
112 - Hey, I'll check his special place.\\
113 - Dewey?\\
114 - You in there, buddy?\\
115 - No.\\
116 - What's wrong, pal?\\
117 - I did something bad.\\
118 - They told me to ride a horsey, and I'm not a baby,\\
119 - but I would have played with the carpet cleaner,\\
120 - and I didn't have a quarter anyway.\\
121 - Uh-huh. Dewey, honey,\\
122 - Daddy's getting a cramp in his leg.\\
123 - What did you do?\\
124 - I took something from Mommy's store.\\
125 - Well, that's very serious.\\
126 - What did you take?\\
127 - A candy bar?\\
128 - No. It's not a candy bar.\\
129 - Oh? Well, what is it?\\
130 - $150 bottle of cognac?\\
131 - How could you take this?!\\
132 - I'm sorry.\\
133 - My God, would you look at this thing?\\
134 - Can you imagine the man\\
135 - who spends 150 bucks on a bottle of cognac?\\
136 - What do you think a guy like that pays for socks?\\
137 - Dewey, what am I going to do with you?\\
138 - This works pretty good, Mom.\\
139 - Go get your jacket; we're going back to the store.\\
140 - You are going to return this bottle to Mr. Pinter,\\
141 - apologize and accept the consequences.\\
142 - What do mean, "fired"?!\\
143 - You can't fire me for this.\\
144 - Sorry. Store policy is very clear about stealing.\\
145 - But he didn't steal it; he returned it.\\
146 - It's right there. The bottle is perfect.\\
147 - You can just put it right back on the shelf.\\
148 - I already marked it out of inventory.\\
149 - My hands are tied here.\\
150 - What are you talking about?\\
151 - You don't even do inventory.\\
152 - You foist if off on me because you make so many mistakes.\\
153 - You're not exactly making me regret my decision here, Lois.\\
154 - Mom?\\
155 - Oh, honey, it's okay. It's okay.\\
156 - This is just an excuse.\\
157 - You have hated me since the minute you got here\\
158 - because I was first choice for your job and I turned it down.\\
159 - You know, you think what you want, okay?\\
160 - At least I didn't raise a thief.\\
161 - Velcro. I win the pool.\\
162 - Sweet home Alabama.\\
163 - Where the skies are so blue.\\
164 - Sweet home Alabama.\\
165 - Lord, I'm coming home\\
166 - to you.\\
167 - Oh, very, very nice, Bridget.\\
168 - That was very nice.\\
169 - Oh, Francis, I wanted to thank you again\\
170 - for being so helpful.\\
171 - Usually, the honor guards just sit around and gawk,\\
172 - but you've really thrown yourself\\
173 - into this whole hog, haven't you?\\
174 - What can I say? I love the theater.\\
175 - Francis, will you help me decide on my leg extensions?\\
176 - Which do you think looks better--\\
177 - right leg...\\
178 - or left leg?\\
179 - Hmm.\\
180 - Can you... do both?\\
181 - It's been ten days since Mom lost her job.\\
182 - Yesterday for dinner, we had macaroni and rice.\\
183 - Today it's rice and macaroni.\\
184 - Mom, I can't eat this stuff anymore.\\
185 - Reese, this is not the time for complaining.\\
186 - I'm not complaining; I'm constipated.\\
187 - I'm sorry, we can't afford to live lavishly anymore.\\
188 - Drink your milk.\\
189 - It's lumpy.\\
190 - Then chew it.\\
191 - Hey, come on, we can do this.\\
192 - We've had to economize before.\\
193 - Remember when Grandma drove into the living room?\\
194 - Or last year, when we were saving up for Disneyland?\\
195 - We're going to Disneyland?\\
196 - No.\\
197 - It's like that.\\
198 - Except this time, we're just trying to keep the house.\\
199 - Okay, everybody, stop worrying.\\
200 - I am going to find another job.\\
201 - Another cashier job with flexible hours\\
202 - that allows me to leave whenever I need to take care of my kids.\\
203 - Well, can't you get unemployment or something?\\
204 - No. I only worked 38 hours a week.\\
205 - They consider that part-time.\\
206 - You know, I hope you are at least learning\\
207 - something from all this.\\
208 - Yeah, if you do something bad, don't tell.\\
209 - No. We did the right thing.\\
210 - That's what's important.\\
211 - Can't we at least do a load of laundry or something?\\
212 - Everything I have stinks.\\
213 - Yeah, he wants to smell good for... Julie!\\
214 - Malcolm.\\
215 - Yeah, yeah.\\
216 - It was worth it.\\
217 - So we can't do laundry, we have to share baths,\\
218 - and yesterday, she had our cable turned off.\\
219 - Our cable!\\
220 - How's your... love life?\\
221 - What? So, basically, everything I tell you\\
222 - in confidence as a friend\\
223 - you're going to use to make fun of me?\\
224 - I have... nothing else.\\
225 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
226 - You want to split lunches?\\
227 - What?\\
228 - Yeah, sure.\\
229 - I have a Chinese chicken salad, a tangerine,\\
230 - and, ooh, Jordan almonds.\\
231 - What do you have?\\
232 - Leftover eggs from breakfast.\\
233 - Oh.\\
234 - Uh, I'm on a special diet, for sports.\\
235 - Oh, I forgot.\\
236 - I have to go... work out.\\
237 - I'll see you later.\\
238 - I can't take this anymore!\\
239 - Everything I want, I can't have!\\
240 - Anything that's nice, I can't do!\\
241 - Everyone in the world gets to do everything except me!\\
242 - Malcolm... Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
243 - I know there's other people worse off than me.\\
244 - You know what? I don't care.\\
245 - I'm sick of going to school every day smelling like feet!\\
246 - Malcolm...\\
247 - I hate being poor, okay?!\\
248 - I mean, is that so bad?\\
249 - Why is that, like, some big character flaw?\\
250 - It's not my fault we're poor!\\
251 - Malcolm!\\
252 - You, um...\\
253 - left your backpack.\\
254 - Maybe you should try taking a really deep breath\\
255 - before you start talking. Yeah.\\
256 - Francis, where have you been?\\
257 - I've been looking for you for days.\\
258 - I'm sorry, Dad. I've just been buried here.\\
259 - Okay, listen, I've got kind of\\
260 - a good news/bad news thing here.\\
261 - Your mom lost her job, and we're pretty broke.\\
262 - The good news is, that makes your tuition an issue.\\
263 - Now, I think I can talk her into letting you come home.\\
264 - Dad, no, I can't come home!\\
265 - Marlin Academy is the best thing\\
266 - that has ever happened to me.\\
267 - I am at a crucial point in my rehabilitation.\\
268 - Uh-huh. What's her name?\\
269 - That's the thing-- there's, like, ten of them!\\
270 - Check the peephole.\\
271 - If they've got a hand truck, don't open it.\\
272 - Craig, what are you doing here?\\
273 - Lois, I just had a meeting with Mr. Pinter--\\
274 - well, more like an hour begging, really--\\
275 - but the point is, you can have your old job back!\\
276 - Yes!\\
277 - Craig, that is such good news!\\
278 - And all you have to do is apologize.\\
279 - And let him dock your pay 150 bucks.\\
280 - And you have to work the graveyard shift\\
281 - for a couple months.\\
282 - Oh.\\
283 - Sounds good, Mom.\\
284 - No, thanks. What?!\\
285 - You're kidding! Why?!\\
286 - Because that's like admitting he's right.\\
287 - I'm not going to do that.\\
288 - Lois, if this makes any difference,\\
289 - I will work every graveyard shift right alongside you--\\
290 - every single one of them.\\
291 - Oh, hi, Craig. What's going on?\\
292 - Nothing. Just business.\\
293 - Take it easy, tiger.\\
294 - We're working.\\
295 - Well, I am.\\
296 - Hi.\\
297 - Back to the grind.\\
298 - Nice guy.\\
299 - Thank you, Tanya.\\
300 - Tanya, that was fantastic.\\
301 - I swear, when you put tap to it,\\
302 - the Pledge of Allegiance just comes alive.\\
303 - One suggestion: do you have a tube top?\\
304 - Oh, Francis, you are just wonderful.\\
305 - I mean, you're so different than the local boys.\\
306 - I mean, I haven't even known you that long,\\
307 - and I already feel so connected to you.\\
308 - I know. It's almost mystical.\\
309 - Yeah. And I'm so glad the gay thing isn't an issue.\\
310 - You're gay?\\
311 - No, no, silly-- you are.\\
312 - Wait, you think I'm gay?\\
313 - Oh, you don't have to hide anything, honey.\\
314 - I mean, we're a lot more liberal here\\
315 - than you think we are.\\
316 - I mean, it's not like Birmingham.\\
317 - Wait a minute-- you think I'm gay?\\
318 - Why do you think I'm gay?\\
319 - Oh, come on.\\
320 - You like the theater, you're good with decorating,\\
321 - and, well, you're completely obsessed with your mother.\\
322 - Can you undo my hooks?\\
323 - Tanya, I'm kind of having a dilemma here...\\
324 - Oh, great. Frannie, can you spray me?\\
325 - My suit keeps riding up.\\
326 - That's why I'm here... girlfriend.\\
327 - So what did you want to talk about?\\
328 - I'm your teacher. Can't we just talk?\\
329 - You know, that Julie Houlerman\\
330 - is a very special little girl.\\
331 - Oh, come on!\\
332 - Caroline, I don't want to...\\
333 - Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.\\
334 - So private, so guarded.\\
335 - But you don't have to be that way with me.\\
336 - I'm on your side.\\
337 - Julie knows that-- she's not even in my class.\\
338 - She talked to you? About me?\\
339 - What'd she say?\\
340 - Aw, nothing that wasn't obvious already.\\
341 - You know, when you open up to people,\\
342 - you will always be surprised\\
343 - just how well things turn out.\\
344 - Surprise!\\
345 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
346 - Julie organized\\
347 - the whole thing herself, and everyone\\
348 - in school responded.\\
349 - Dear Malcolm, this isn't just food.\\
350 - It's an expression of how we all feel about you.\\
351 - Our hearts go out to you in your time of need.\\
352 - You're going to keep the food? Yes.\\
353 - I'm not going to throw away perfectly good pie filling\\
354 - and... lamb chutney.\\
355 - Don't you even care how humiliating this is?\\
356 - We've done can drives.\\
357 - This is just the crap people find\\
358 - when they clean out the garage.\\
359 - Okay, just stop it.\\
360 - I know how hard this is,\\
361 - but no one ever said life is fair.\\
362 - Sometimes decent, hard-working people\\
363 - get dumped on for no good reason,\\
364 - and they just have to wipe out their eyes\\
365 - and keep on walking.\\
366 - Something will turn up.\\
367 - We just have to hold on a little bit longer.\\
368 - And in the meantime, be thankful for small favors.\\
369 - Anyone want the last olive?\\
370 - Those aren't olives.\\
371 - Those are peaches.\\
372 - Well, you got him here early, that's good.\\
373 - He'll be fine in a few days.\\
374 - Just like when this one ate the frog.\\
375 - I only ate half of it.\\
376 - I won't put the stomach pump on the bill.\\
377 - I mean, he did most of the work on the way over.\\
378 - Thanks, Don. Uh...\\
379 - listen, as far as the bill goes,\\
380 - what kind of neighborhood are we in?\\
381 - Well... the emergency room,\\
382 - couple days of observation--\\
383 - probably three or four.\\
384 - Three or four... hun...?\\
385 - Okay.\\
386 - You boys take care of your dad.\\
387 - I'm going to go see Mr. Pinter\\
388 - and beg for my job back.\\
389 - What? Mom, wait.\\
390 - You don't have to do that.\\
391 - Yes, I do. I don't want to,\\
392 - shouldn't have to, but guess what?\\
393 - I do.\\
394 - But I want you boys to understand something.\\
395 - I am not going back on anything I said before.\\
396 - She's completely going back on it,\\
397 - but I'm not going to kick her when she's down.\\
398 - You're totally going back on it.\\
399 - No, I am not.\\
400 - Everything I said before still goes.\\
401 - You know, sometimes bad things happen\\
402 - and you don't understand why,\\
403 - and you just have to trust that there's a good reason for it.\\
404 - Sure, it's easy to work in mysterious ways\\
405 - when you have a job.\\
406 - The first one who laughs gets their ass kicked.\\
407 - You have incredible hands.\\
408 - Well, it's easy on such a beautiful back.\\
409 - Not to mention the most talented...\\
410 - sweet...\\
411 - sexy...\\
412 - What?\\
413 - Francis...\\
414 - are... are you sure you're really...\\
415 - how you are?\\
416 - Tanya, I'm so confused.\\
417 - I mean, I thought that I was, but when I'm around you,\\
418 - I have these... strange, new feelings.\\
419 - I feel like... maybe I could... change.\\
420 - That you could be the woman who changes me.\\
421 - Oh, Francis...\\
422 - I was hoping you'd say that.\\
423 - I want to be that woman\\
424 - for you.\\
425 - Oh, and don't you worry, honey.\\
426 - If there's one thing we know how to do\\
427 - down here,\\
428 - it's how to fix this.\\
429 - And with God's help,\\
430 - we can say "no!" to weakness.\\
431 - We can say "no!" to all things unnatural!\\
432 - It is procreation, not recreation!\\
433 - And when Satan tempts us, what do we do?\\
434 - Pray out the gay.\\
435 - Get to it!\\
436 - I have to say, Lois, I'm surprised\\
437 - by this change in your attitude.\\
438 - Yeah, well, me, too.\\
439 - I know we've had our differences,\\
440 - but I hope that we can make all this\\
441 - water under the bridge.\\
442 - So, if you'll just sign here...\\
443 - Mm, what's this?\\
444 - Your apology.\\
445 - I think I captured your voice rather nicely.\\
446 - You want it in writing?\\
447 - Yes.\\
448 - Look, Lois, you can tell these clowns\\
449 - whatever you want-- that I got on my knees\\
450 - and begged you to come back, I don't care.\\
451 - I just want you and I to know how things really are.\\
452 - That's not a signature.\\
453 - No, it's more of a suggestion.\\
454 - "The horse you rode in on" is optional.\\
455 - Now, look...\\
456 - No, you look.\\
457 - I don't deserve this.\\
458 - The only thing I ever did wrong\\
459 - was all the work I did to cover your butt.\\
460 - Well, we obviously have different\\
461 - definitions of "wrong."\\
462 - Yeah, I guess we do.\\
463 - For instance, I think it's wrong\\
464 - for you to put your name on sales reports\\
465 - that you didn't write.\\
466 - I think it's wrong you keep a little bag of "herbs"\\
467 - in your bottom left drawer.\\
468 - I think it's wrong you slept with\\
469 - the district manager's wife.\\
470 - And you want to know something?\\
471 - You don't even have to worry about it,\\
472 - because I also think it's wrong to blab this kind of thing.\\
473 - You know, you should be so glad that I'm the only one that knows\\
474 - this stuff about you.\\
475 - Anyone else here would sell you down the river in a second.\\
476 - God, I am so much better than you.\\
477 - Yeah, he just ran off and quit for no reason.\\
478 - Huh, who knows why?\\
479 - See, you do the right thing,\\
480 - and everything works out for the best.\\
481 - Clean.\\
482 - I have Ho Hos-- real Ho Hos.\\
483 - You know, I'm sure I'm neglecting\\
484 - my spiritual side, but... money rules.\\
485 - The best part is\\
486 - I can finally get everything straightened out with Julie.\\
487 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
488 - Look, we're not poor anymore!\\
489 - So I don't want any more of your stupid pity, okay?!\\
490 - That helped, right?
\subsection {Episode 10: Stock Car Races}
1 - What are you looking at, monkey boy?\\
2 - Ow!\\
3 - Ow! Ow! Reese!\\
4 - What are you doing?\\
5 - Help! Ow! Help! Mom, help!\\
6 - No, cut it out. Cut it out. Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
7 - Help! It hurts! Ow!\\
8 - - Knock it off, you little... - Reese!\\
9 - What the heck are you doing? Honest to God,\\
10 - you can't leave that kid alone for five minutes\\
11 - without picking on him! I didn't do anything, Mom.\\
12 - Go! He's lying!\\
13 - I gave him that.\\
14 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
15 -     I don't know    \\
16 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - Honey, which juice don't I like--\\
27 - apple or grape?\\
28 - You don't like either.\\
29 - Oh, right.\\
30 - Malcolm, what is all this stuff from your teacher?\\
31 - That woman sends home two or three fliers every day.\\
32 - She says she wants the parents\\
33 - to be as involved as possible with the children.\\
34 - At school? It's the only break I get.\\
35 - What exactly is "personal fulfillment week"?\\
36 - Square dancing.\\
37 - That's right, square dancing.\\
38 - You should see it.\\
39 - The Krelboynes dance on the tetherball courts\\
40 - in front of the whole school.\\
41 - We laugh our asses off.\\
42 - Excuse me?\\
43 - Butts.\\
44 - We laugh our butts off.\\
45 - Uh-oh.\\
46 - Open.\\
47 - Swish.\\
48 - Spit.\\
49 - This tastes like crap.\\
50 - Reese is right.\\
51 - This class is turning me into a total weirdo.\\
52 - You are not a weirdo. You are gifted.\\
53 - And if gifted kids are supposed to square-dance,\\
54 - then you'll do it.\\
55 - Probably teaches you geometry.\\
56 - Don't forget to mail these bills; they're late. Ah. Ooh!\\
57 - Two blues, only one pink. We're doing better.\\
58 - Well, don't get cocky.\\
59 - They're hot until I deposit my paycheck.\\
60 - You kids, let's get going. Come on, Malcolm!\\
61 - You don't want them to do-si-doing without you.\\
62 - That's it! For the sake of my manhood,\\
63 - today I'm ditching school. Hey!\\
64 - Why don't I drive you boys to school today?\\
65 - Uh, that's okay, Dad.\\
66 - I don't mind walking.\\
67 - Oh, no, no, no. I really want to.\\
68 - A chance to spend a few extra minutes\\
69 - with my sons, enjoying their company.\\
70 - Honestly, son, it'll be the highlight of my day.\\
71 - Come on.\\
72 - Great. Now I can't even be mad at him.\\
73 - Aw, Stanley.\\
74 - Let me show you how it's done.\\
75 - Uh-oh, eyes down.\\
76 - That was good.\\
77 - You didn't give them any satisfaction.\\
78 - In another six months, they'll be bored with you.\\
79 - That's got to hurt!\\
80 - Mom was right.\\
81 - I do get some sick thrill out of trouble.\\
82 - Ow!\\
83 - That skinny guy! Come on, get him!\\
84 - Commandant on the floor.\\
85 - Ten-hut!\\
86 - I smell smoke.\\
87 - Who is responsible?\\
88 - Very well.\\
89 - We'll do it the hard way.\\
90 - Patton.\\
91 - Francis, please lift up\\
92 - your right foot.\\
93 - Son, you have the worst attitude\\
94 - I've ever seen in 15 years at this institution.\\
95 - You seem compelled\\
96 - to break every rule, to flout every convention.\\
97 - You are never gonna make it--\\
98 - in the Armed Forces or anywhere else.\\
99 - Now, I was never fortunate enough to serve in combat,\\
100 - but I do know what it requires.\\
101 - Look at this dog.\\
102 - He is vicious, he is ungrateful,\\
103 - and yet even he understands the importance\\
104 - of obedience.\\
105 - Do you hear what I am saying, Francis?\\
106 - Yes, sir. I'll try to be more like\\
107 - a Jack Russell terrier, sir.\\
108 - There will be\\
109 - no hot water for this floor for the entire month.\\
110 - You can thank the cadet after I leave.\\
111 - Ow!\\
112 - Reese wiped his booger on my lunch bag.\\
113 - Dewey, what have we taught you about snitching?\\
114 - "Only snitch when asked to snitch."\\
115 - Good boy.\\
116 - So, looking forward to school?\\
117 - I guess. Well, that's a shame.\\
118 - 'Cause we're not going to school.\\
119 - Where are we going?\\
120 - Boys, I'm going to share something with you\\
121 - I hope you'll remember for the rest of your lives.\\
122 - Now, I don't want to spoil the surprise,\\
123 - but I've been planning this for years.\\
124 - I just had to wait\\
125 - until you were all old enough to appreciate it.\\
126 - Hookers?\\
127 - If it gets me out of square dancing, fine.\\
128 - Just sit back\\
129 - and enjoy the ride, boys.\\
130 - We're rebels.\\
131 - We're wild men!\\
132 - Whoo!\\
133 - Where did I put the damn paycheck?\\
134 - Yeah.\\
135 - Those guys are wimps.\\
136 - That's not even half the size of the one I gave you\\
137 - just to get you out of riflery.\\
138 - Hey, thanks for pulling them off me.\\
139 - I owe you one.\\
140 - One?\\
141 - Hey, you want to see something very, very cool?\\
142 - Oh, boy, what have you done now?\\
143 - Oh, isn't he beautiful?\\
144 - He only cost me $20. I'm calling him Otis.\\
145 - Did you listen to anything Spangler said?\\
146 - You're already in enough trouble as it is\\
147 - without bringing in a pet.\\
148 - Well, Spangler has that oversized gerbil.\\
149 - And besides, Otis is not a pet.\\
150 - Otis is a symbol.\\
151 - Of what?\\
152 - Of everything that is beautiful in the world.\\
153 - Independence...\\
154 - free thought.\\
155 - I may be stuck here in this militaristic loony bin,\\
156 - but at least some part of me can stay connected\\
157 - to the things that give me my humanity.\\
158 - You're not gonna turn me in, are you?\\
159 - I don't know. On the one hand,\\
160 - you're probably gonna get caught,\\
161 - because you always do.\\
162 - Then, of course, I'll be involved\\
163 - even though I had nothing to do with it.\\
164 - On the other hand...\\
165 - ...it's a snake.\\
166 - Good man!\\
167 - I think I'm starting to bring out the rebel in you.\\
168 - Touching.\\
169 - Right. Sorry.\\
170 -        \\
171 - Stock car races!\\
172 - Oh, cool!\\
173 - That's right, boys.\\
174 - The real field of dreams--\\
175 - only with concrete instead of all that grass.\\
176 -     I don't want to work...    \\
177 - We all together? Here we go.\\
178 - Excuse us, please. Here we go...\\
179 - Oh, oh! Boys, boys?\\
180 - You see that blue car down in front--\\
181 - - number 16? - Yeah.\\
182 - That is Rusty Malcolm.\\
183 - The greatest man in the history of the sport.\\
184 - Maybe the greatest man ever.\\
185 - 15 NASCAR titles, six world records.\\
186 - Inventor of the in-car urination system.\\
187 - The list is endless.\\
188 - And he came from nothing\\
189 - just like you boys.\\
190 - You see, this is Rusty's last race ever.\\
191 - He's retiring, so I wanted to share him\\
192 - with you before he went so that you can see for yourselves\\
193 - just how much you can accomplish in this world with a...\\
194 - a little persistence and determination.\\
195 - Did you read that article in People\\
196 - about him getting a divorce?\\
197 - Shut your filthy mouth.\\
198 - You know, you were named after Rusty, Malcolm.\\
199 - I was? Yes sirree, Bob.\\
200 - Took me two kids to win that argument.\\
201 - Gentlemen, start your excitement,\\
202 - because here they come!\\
203 - He won!\\
204 - Rusty Malcolm won!\\
205 - Oh, no, sweetheart.\\
206 - That was just the pace lap.\\
207 - How many laps are there?\\
208 - Oh, hundreds.\\
209 - We've got four hours of this.\\
210 - Four hours?!\\
211 - Uh-huh.\\
212 - Do we at least get to see\\
213 - any flaming wrecks?\\
214 - Reese, it's not about that.\\
215 - See, it's about strategy and-and technique.\\
216 - It's-it's about the melding of man and machine.\\
217 - The wrecks are just sort of a bonus.\\
218 - Dewey?\\
219 - You can keep track of the laps.\\
220 -        \\
221 - Can we go get sodas?\\
222 - What? Already?\\
223 - Well, okay.\\
224 - Guess it can't be a special day without sodas, huh?\\
225 - Here. Oh, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
226 - See if you can get your dad a beer.\\
227 - Take my I.D.\\
228 - Come on, Rusty!\\
229 - Firecrackers.\\
230 - Malcolm.\\
231 - I'm gonna say Reese.\\
232 - Dewey, stay with us.\\
233 - You're gonna get lost.\\
234 - No, I won't.\\
235 - Yes, you will.\\
236 - You always do.\\
237 - You know you could help.\\
238 - I'm watching him.\\
239 - He's right over...\\
240 - Man, how does he do that?\\
241 - Totally your fault!\\
242 - He was right in your eye line.\\
243 - You don't pay attention to anything!\\
244 - I pay attention.\\
245 - Score!\\
246 - What are you doing?\\
247 - Too slow.\\
248 - Come on.\\
249 - Let's just go find Dewey.\\
250 - This place sucks.\\
251 - It's hot, it stinks,\\
252 - nobody's T-shirts cover their stomachs,\\
253 - and I'm bored out of my mind.\\
254 - Hey.\\
255 - Look at that.\\
256 - Let's check it out.\\
257 - I don't know.\\
258 - It doesn't just say "keep out,"\\
259 - it says "forbidden."\\
260 - And they wouldn't bother making it "forbidden"\\
261 - if it wasn't something totally bitching on the other side.\\
262 - Wow. I can't find a flaw in his logic.\\
263 - Come on. What's the worst that could happen?\\
264 - We didn't do anything!\\
265 - I'm a diabetic!\\
266 - I need insulin!\\
267 - Sit down!\\
268 - You are such an idiot!\\
269 - It actually was pretty bitching.\\
270 - I'm totally getting one of these for Christmas.\\
271 - What does the sign say?\\
272 - "No soliciting."\\
273 - Yeah, that includes Jesus.\\
274 - No, it's Carolyn Miller, Malcolm's teacher.\\
275 - I need to talk to you.\\
276 - Yeah, come on in!\\
277 - Oh, spring cleaning?\\
278 - Oh, ho.\\
279 - Yeah, I'm cleaning house, all right.\\
280 - I'm sorry to bother you at home,\\
281 - but when Malcolm didn't show up for school today...\\
282 - What?\\
283 - Malcolm cut school today?\\
284 - Yeah. Actually, not just today.\\
285 - Now, I know your first reaction is probably\\
286 - gonna be one of understandable... Wait!\\
287 - "Ditching."\\
288 - We have a winner!\\
289 - Anyway, this week we've been\\
290 - doing a lot of work on folk movement,\\
291 - and I-I think that Malcolm\\
292 - may be ditching because he's afaid that...\\
293 - well, that he may not seem... graceful.\\
294 - Oh, you're serious.\\
295 - Yes, I'm serious.\\
296 - I think he may have body issues.\\
297 - Look, honey, you're probably very bright,\\
298 - but you got a lot to learn about boys.\\
299 - First off, they're able to think maybe\\
300 - three minutes into the future, and it's our job\\
301 - to make sure that future comes crashing down on them\\
302 - within the time limit.\\
303 - Otherwise, they never learn anything.\\
304 - Help lift.\\
305 - What is that?\\
306 - Don't be such a baby.\\
307 - I'll get the tongs.\\
308 - I'll be Kevin.\\
309 - You be Clyde.\\
310 - Think you can cry?\\
311 - No. I got to feel it.\\
312 - Ooh, ooh, I got an idea.\\
313 - No!\\
314 - Just follow my lead.\\
315 - No, Reese. Whatever it is, no!\\
316 - Well, I guess you boys had some time\\
317 - to think about what you've done.\\
318 - Yes, sir.\\
319 - Look, I, uh...\\
320 - used to be your age.\\
321 - And I understand how tempting\\
322 - a place like that can be.\\
323 - And I guess you kids really didn't do any major harm,\\
324 - so I've decided to let you off... Hi-ya!\\
325 - You idiot!\\
326 - Open it! It's locked!\\
327 - Okay, I think I can cry now.\\
328 - My pleasure, Rusty!\\
329 - Hey, how about that, boys?\\
330 - Well, this just plain hurts my feelings.\\
331 - Oh, man.\\
332 - Oh, ma... Stanley, I'm sorry, I did...\\
333 - Wait. I'm trying to see if I'm inspired\\
334 - by its symbolic bid for freedom.\\
335 - No. I'm just really pissed.\\
336 - Okay, don't overreact.\\
337 - It's just a snake, right?\\
338 - So, it's got to be around here somewhere.\\
339 - No big deal.\\
340 - Oh, my God, Patton! No!\\
341 - Hi, Mom. Uh, I was just thinking about how much I missed you guys\\
342 - and I love you, and... I was thinking\\
343 - I should come for a visit, you know, like, today.\\
344 - There's a flight leaving in half an hour\\
345 - and I already booked it,\\
346 - so I just need your credit card number to...\\
347 - Well, honey, here's the thing.\\
348 - Right now, you are actually better off\\
349 - being as far away from me as possible.\\
350 - But... Aw, you got to trust me\\
351 - on this one, Francis-- or, uh, should I say...\\
352 - "Olaf Mortenson" of Wheatville, Montana?\\
353 - You know, I have learned more in two hours with you\\
354 - than I have in six years of teaching.\\
355 - So, did your life\\
356 - turn out anything at all like you planned?\\
357 - Oh, God, no.\\
358 - Oh, when I was a girl,\\
359 - I had all these crazy, romantic dreams.\\
360 - I wanted to be a blackjack dealer\\
361 - in an Indian reservation.\\
362 - Didn't work out.\\
363 - Stubby thumbs.\\
364 - Well, at least you have your home\\
365 - and your family.\\
366 - All I come home to every night\\
367 - are three howling cats and... Bob.\\
368 - Who's Bob?\\
369 - My showerhead.\\
370 - Do you have anything stronger?\\
371 - I'm way ahead of you.\\
372 - ...and it looks like Rusty Malcolm\\
373 - will win his final race!\\
374 - Rusty!\\
375 - I can't believe they're missing this.\\
376 - What happened? What happened?\\
377 - Rusty do something?\\
378 - Missed it!\\
379 - What'd he do?\\
380 - Men... a terrible tragedy has befallen us.\\
381 - At approximately 1700 hours,\\
382 - our beloved Patton\\
383 - was set upon by a serpent and devoured.\\
384 - I, myself, fired a few rounds\\
385 - as it slithered away,\\
386 - but hampered by a lack of depth perception,\\
387 - my efforts were useless.\\
388 - Now... after an incident such as this,\\
389 - certain questions arise.\\
390 - Leaving aside for the moment\\
391 - why God feels the need to take away everything that I love,\\
392 - that leaves us with the matter of\\
393 - who is responsible.\\
394 - Can you explain that, Francis?\\
395 - Yes, sir. I believe you lost that finger\\
396 - trying to restart the school lawnmower, sir.\\
397 - What is in the hand?\\
398 - They appear to be Raisinettes, sir.\\
399 - They are snake droppings, found in your footlocker.\\
400 - Now, what do you have to say for yourself?\\
401 - Sir, I'm obviously the victim of an elaborate conspiracy\\
402 - to frame me.\\
403 - It's just too perfect, sir.\\
404 - Two months!\\
405 - No hot water, no television,\\
406 - and an 8:00 p.m. curfew for the entire academy.\\
407 - Feel free to thank the cadet\\
408 - after I leave.\\
409 - Could I ask one favor-- would you send a picture\\
410 - to my mom with "I told you so" written across it?\\
411 - Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!\\
412 - Way to go, man!\\
413 - What?\\
414 - We hated that yappy, little rat.\\
415 - Let's hear it for Francis, you guys!\\
416 - This is an improvement, right?\\
417 - Reese!\\
418 - Malcolm!\\
419 - Hi, Dad.\\
420 - Hi. Where are your brothers?\\
421 - Oh, geez.\\
422 - Come on.\\
423 - Uh... what-what seems to be the trouble here,\\
424 - Officer, uh... Karl?\\
425 - These your boys? Uh, yes, sir, that they are.\\
426 - Fine boys. Couldn't be prouder of them.\\
427 - For your information, these are two of the worst kids\\
428 - I have ever encountered in my life.\\
429 - And I work the state fair.\\
430 - Really? See, that must be fascinating.\\
431 - Seeing people from all over,\\
432 - the different cultures... Hey!\\
433 - I don't want to be a hard case here,\\
434 - but these kids physically attacked me.\\
435 - Uh-huh, uh-huh. Plus, they completely destroyed\\
436 - a $300 pneumatic drill, which someone's going to pay for.\\
437 - Well, this all sounds pretty serious.\\
438 - But don't you worry, Officer Karl.\\
439 - They are gonna hear all about when I get them home. You see,\\
440 - I'm just sorry that they had to put you through all of this.\\
441 - That's not fair.\\
442 - And I, uh, see, I fully intend to pay for... Aah!\\
443 - Clyde, Kevin! Get to the car!\\
444 - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\\
445 - Ooh!\\
446 - Okay.\\
447 - All right, men.\\
448 - Well, I hope you've all learned something today, huh?\\
449 - I learned my dad is actually capable\\
450 - of doing something cool.\\
451 - I'm not saying violence is cool, but that was cool.\\
452 - I always wondered where we got it from.\\
453 - Program... tickets...\\
454 - Huh.\\
455 - Your mother's paycheck.\\
456 - Now, boys, remember, as far as your mom knows...\\
457 - I have been at work all day.\\
458 - Okay, go on.\\
459 - All right.\\
460 - Well, at least she doesn't know I skipped school all week.
\subsection {Episode 11: Funeral}
1 - "I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye.\\
2 - "'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow.\\
3 - "Nor that is not the lark\\
4 - "whose notes do beat\\
5 - "the vaulty heavens so high above our head.\\
6 - "I have more care to stay than will to go.\\
7 - Come, death. And welcome."\\
8 - Yes! He nailed it!\\
9 - Malcolm...\\
10 - that was wonderful!\\
11 - So sensitive and full of passion.\\
12 - It was just beautiful.\\
13 - Before you say anything,\\
14 - just remember we're best friends.\\
15 - So that wheelchair\\
16 - isn't gonna stop me from kicking your ass.\\
17 - Bring it on, Homeo.\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - What do you mean what happens when you die?\\
31 - You're dead.\\
32 - That's it. Oh, now,\\
33 - honey, that's not quite true.\\
34 - Actually, son, after death\\
35 - your body undergoes\\
36 - a fascinating series of changes.\\
37 - First, it bloats up like a balloon.\\
38 - Then shrivels like a raisin.\\
39 - Then tiny microbes\\
40 - you can't even see, but are on you right now,\\
41 - start to devour your flesh\\
42 - and return all the elements in your body back to the soil.\\
43 - Now, some people will tell you\\
44 - that your hair keeps growing, but that's... that's a myth.\\
45 - It's actually your head that shrinks.\\
46 - Now, go get ready for Aunt Helen's funeral.\\
47 - Julie, listen, I'm sorry I'm canceling out so late.\\
48 - That's okay.\\
49 - I mean, it's a funeral.\\
50 - So, were you close with your aunt?\\
51 - No, but I guess my mom was.\\
52 - She keeps saying how important this is.\\
53 - Anyway, I'm really sorry.\\
54 - Especially since you're stuck with the extra ticket.\\
55 - Well, that's okay.\\
56 - Maybe I'll ask Jimmy to go.\\
57 - Who's Jimmy?\\
58 - Jimmy Westcott. He plays football.\\
59 - Bye.\\
60 - Oh, yeah. Life's fair.\\
61 - Did you call that girl?\\
62 - Yes, I called her.\\
63 - I called her and told her I couldn't go to the concert.\\
64 - And now she's probably going to invite someone else.\\
65 - Well, Malcolm, I'm sorry that my mother's sister--\\
66 - the woman who took care of me every day after school--\\
67 - had to die and inconvenience\\
68 - your social life.\\
69 - She does it on purpose.\\
70 - I could have made up a million different escape plans,\\
71 - but now my brain is filled with mom guilt.\\
72 - Who's this?\\
73 - How should I know?\\
74 - Hal?\\
75 - Beats me.\\
76 - Dewey?\\
77 - Is this a friend of yours?\\
78 - Uh-huh. Who is he?\\
79 - I don't know.\\
80 - What's your name, son?\\
81 - Egg.\\
82 - Did he say Greg?\\
83 - I thought he said Craig.\\
84 - His name is Egg.\\
85 - "Egg"? I named him.\\
86 - Well, you can't keep him.\\
87 - He needs to go home, okay?\\
88 - Okay.\\
89 - This stinks.\\
90 - Whether it's a wedding, a funeral or court date,\\
91 - these family gatherings are always the same.\\
92 - Ooh! I just can't take my hands off that face!\\
93 - I can't wait till I get zits.\\
94 - At least then I can fight back.\\
95 - Hal, you have to get ready.\\
96 - Why are you still messing around with those record albums?\\
97 - Well, I thought I was gonna spend today in the garage\\
98 - listening to them on my quadraphonic.\\
99 - But now that we're going to the funeral,\\
100 - I have to reseal the shrink wrap.\\
101 - Hal! I'll hurry, okay?\\
102 - I have to get my speech ready anyway.\\
103 - Honey, you know you don't have to talk\\
104 - at every funeral we go to.\\
105 - Whew, I wish that were true.\\
106 - You see how people look to me\\
107 - when they ask if somebody has a few words to say?\\
108 - They're not looking to you, they're looking at you.\\
109 - To, at... what's the difference?\\
110 - Hello.\\
111 - Hey, Mom, I'm just warning you,\\
112 - someone claiming to be the commandant might call you soon.\\
113 - It's just this guy down the hall.\\
114 - Just play along and pretend you believe him.\\
115 - He's totally harmless.\\
116 - Francis, I really can't talk to you right now.\\
117 - We're on our way to Aunt Helen's funeral.\\
118 - Aunt Helen died?\\
119 - Well, I sure hope so. We're going to her funeral.\\
120 - Well, when did she die?\\
121 - Mom, why didn't anybody tell me?!\\
122 - Uh, well, honey, we just,\\
123 - we didn't want to have to worry you over nothing.\\
124 - Nothing? She's dead! How's Uncle Fred taking it?\\
125 - Well, I don't think he's thought too much about it.\\
126 - He died about two months ago.\\
127 - What?! Francis, I'm sorry.\\
128 - I really have to go. Here.\\
129 - Talk to your brother. Mom?\\
130 - Hello?\\
131 - All right, let's see it.\\
132 - I can't breathe.\\
133 - Fine.\\
134 - You know the drill.\\
135 - Upgrade.\\
136 - See?\\
137 - Problem solved.\\
138 - Hello?\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - Okay, well, you can wear\\
141 - one of the suits that Uncle Fred left you.\\
142 - Aw, Mom, a dead suit?\\
143 - Cool. A dead suit.\\
144 - Dewey, why don't you help your little friend\\
145 - find his way out? I did.\\
146 - He keeps coming back.\\
147 - This thing's an open casket, right?\\
148 - I think so. Why?\\
149 - Because I'm going to stash this with Aunt Helen.\\
150 - What is that?\\
151 - It's a Mighty Man. Mom and Dad had it\\
152 - in the back of their closet for some reason.\\
153 - I'm Mighty Man. It's Dewey's birthday next week.\\
154 - This is his present.\\
155 - Oh. What'd you do to it?\\
156 - I stomped on it. Why would you do that?\\
157 - Look, I don't know why I do the things I do.\\
158 - I just know I don't want to get caught.\\
159 - That's why Aunt Helen is getting a new friend.\\
160 - You're gonna bury that with her?\\
161 - You are so dead.\\
162 - Hey, I watch lawyer shows.\\
163 - Mom will think I did it,\\
164 - but she can't prove it without this.\\
165 - It's in the Constitution--\\
166 - no evidence, no conviction.\\
167 - E pluribus unum.\\
168 - Oh, yeah.\\
169 - Hi, honey. Hey, you know,\\
170 - I finally found my joke cards.\\
171 - For some reason, they were behind the water heater.\\
172 - Really? Hey, how's this?\\
173 - "A priest, a rabbi and Uncle Fred are..."\\
174 - Oh, well, Aunt Helen.\\
175 - "...are playing golf with Saint Peter."\\
176 - Hal, please! Hey, have you seen my pun file?\\
177 - It's in a box marked "laughter thoughts."\\
178 - Laughter thoughts?\\
179 - How did she die? Cats ate her face.\\
180 - Dewey, I think you're confused. I'm asking about Aunt Helen.\\
181 - Cats ate her face. Look, would you just\\
182 - put Mom or Dad on the phone?\\
183 - Hello. Dad!\\
184 - What happened to Aunt Helen?\\
185 - Cats ate her face.\\
186 - Well, here, Dewey knows more about it than I do.\\
187 - Mom, I hate wearing Reese's hand-me-downs.\\
188 - Look at this.\\
189 - Jelly in the pockets, the fly's broken,\\
190 - and it smells like wet dog.\\
191 - Well, you should be glad he only wore it once.\\
192 - You know, I'm trying to be there for Mom.\\
193 - But the annoyances are starting to outweigh the guilt.\\
194 - I'm this close to sneaking out of the whole thing.\\
195 - Well, I suppose you're entitled to complain.\\
196 - After all, it's only my Aunt Helen.\\
197 - What is she-- a mind reader?\\
198 - And then there were ants on her bones.\\
199 - And the police came. Dad, listen...\\
200 - Hey, can you think of anything that rhymes with cadaver? Dad?\\
201 - How long is this funeral gonna take?\\
202 - Including traveling time? All day.\\
203 - I know, I know. But remember,\\
204 - it'll make your mom happy.\\
205 - Mom really loved Aunt Helen, huh?\\
206 - Oh, God, no.\\
207 - Your mom hated her.\\
208 - What? She "hated her"? Mm-hmm.\\
209 - Everyone did. Horrible woman.\\
210 - I used to have to forbid her from calling here\\
211 - 'cause she always made your mom cry.\\
212 - I can't believe Mom tricked me like that.\\
213 - I'll tell you one thing--\\
214 - I now consider myself totally free\\
215 - to ditch this funeral.\\
216 - I got to call Julie.\\
217 - Hello? Malcolm!\\
218 - Oh, thank God! Somebody I can talk to.\\
219 - Sorry, I have to make a call.\\
220 - No...\\
221 - So, your aunt's... not dead?\\
222 - No. It turned out to be one of those comas\\
223 - where they think you're dead\\
224 - and they put you on the embalmer's table\\
225 - and you wake up at the last second.\\
226 - It was a close call.\\
227 - Uh, okay.\\
228 - I guess we'll pick you up at 2:00.\\
229 - Great.\\
230 - I figure I'll commit to it first and come up with a plan later.\\
231 - I always think better under pressure...\\
232 - or is it when I'm not under pressure?\\
233 - Oh, well. Too late now.\\
234 - I'm ready to go. Yeah. Hey!\\
235 - You're taking a backpack to the funeral?\\
236 - My back gets cold.\\
237 - Fair enough.\\
238 - Look, Francis,\\
239 - I guess I get scattered. You know, sometimes I forget\\
240 - what I told you, and you're not here, so I don't...\\
241 - I'm not there because you sent me away.\\
242 - I swear, I'm not even a part of this family anymore.\\
243 - Francis, it's very important that you understand\\
244 - that is not true.\\
245 - But I don't have time right now. I understand.\\
246 - It's not like it's a matter of life and death.\\
247 - Oh, wait, it is!\\
248 - Anyone else die in the last five minutes\\
249 - I should know about?\\
250 - Francis, you want to know everything\\
251 - that's been happening?\\
252 - Your father mowed the lawn,\\
253 - Reese polished off all the cereal,\\
254 - and I dropped a frying pan on my foot\\
255 - and I got a big black toe.\\
256 - You want me to send a picture?\\
257 - Egg! Cut it out!\\
258 - Who is Egg?\\
259 - Oh, he's a new boy in the house.\\
260 - What?!\\
261 - Okay.\\
262 - It'll only hurt for a second\\
263 - and I'll get out of the funeral.\\
264 - I can tell Julie a really cool story\\
265 - about how I got my black eye.\\
266 - Aw, I'm so gutless!\\
267 - Why are you taking so long?\\
268 - Let's go.\\
269 - Reese, listen.\\
270 - I know it sounds crazy,\\
271 - but I need you to hit me.\\
272 - You idiot!\\
273 - In the eye!\\
274 - And leave a mark for Mom to see?\\
275 - Forget it.\\
276 - No bruises, no evidence...\\
277 - no crime.\\
278 - I guess we move on to plan B-- lying.\\
279 - What book report?\\
280 - I just remembered.\\
281 - I have a big book report due tomorrow.\\
282 - And I haven't even started reading it.\\
283 - Standard technique--\\
284 - you volunteer a small crime\\
285 - to distract them from looking for the big one.\\
286 - So, what's the report on?\\
287 - A Tale of Two Cities.\\
288 - Oh, how many words? 750.\\
289 - Was that on your assignment sheet? No, it's an addendum.\\
290 - When did you get that? Thursday. I didn't bring it home.\\
291 - That's why I forgot to do the assignment.\\
292 - Ooh, nice one.\\
293 - Well, I suppose if it's schoolwork.\\
294 - That's the mislead.\\
295 - Wait for the reverse.\\
296 - A Tale of Two Cities.\\
297 - Who's that by? Charles Dickens.\\
298 - Oh, I thought it was Victor Hugo. No, it's Dickens.\\
299 - Is that the one with Jean Valjean?\\
300 - That's Les Miserables. No, no.\\
301 - Uh, isn't A Tale of Two Cities the one with Jean Valjean,\\
302 - where he's says, "It's a far, far better thing I do..."\\
303 - right before he steals a loaf of bread?\\
304 - No. Sidney Carton says that right before they behead him.\\
305 - I thought you hadn't read it.\\
306 - What? No. I said I hadn't written it.\\
307 - And when is it due?\\
308 - Tomorrow, I told you.\\
309 - On Les Miserables? Yes. No!\\
310 - It's on Tale of Two Cities.\\
311 - Which you haven't read yet. Right.\\
312 - But you just said you did.\\
313 - No, I-I said I didn't, and then you said...\\
314 - It was Thursday, and...\\
315 - Look, I just don't want to go to this stupid funeral!\\
316 - There's no reason for me to go, and I want to go\\
317 - - to the concert with Julie! - Let's go, let's go.\\
318 - I'll be waiting in the car.\\
319 - Malcolm?\\
320 - I am ashamed of you.\\
321 - Wanting to deny your poor Aunt Helen her due.\\
322 - No, that won't work on me, because I know\\
323 - you didn't love Aunt Helen. You hated her!\\
324 - Of course I hated her. What does that have to do with anything?\\
325 - What? Malcolm, this isn't about love.\\
326 - It's about family.\\
327 - We have a duty to this family.\\
328 - And we are darn well gonna do it!\\
329 - But why? It's not fair!\\
330 - You can't just stick the word "family" in front of something\\
331 - and turn everyone else into slaves.\\
332 - It makes no sense.\\
333 - No one liked this woman.\\
334 - So why do we have to pretend like we did now?\\
335 - What good will it do anybody?\\
336 - Hal?\\
337 - I got nothing.\\
338 - I could really use some support here.\\
339 - Excuse me?\\
340 - I am being incredibly supportive.\\
341 - I'm giving up my entire day for this-this thing.\\
342 - And you don't hear me complaining.\\
343 - Hal, it was a bunch of old record albums.\\
344 - It's not like you're not giving up something important.\\
345 - Well, they're important to me.\\
346 - You-you people!\\
347 - I can't believe you.\\
348 - I asked you to do one thing that...\\
349 - You're not asking; you're ordering.\\
350 - After all I do for this family.\\
351 - I cook, I clean, I spackle, I plunge.\\
352 - And none of it means anything to any of you people!\\
353 - And the one time I ask you for something--\\
354 - something that I shouldn't even have to ask you for--\\
355 - and all I get are complaints!\\
356 - Well, what about me, hmm?\\
357 - You think I want to be cleaning out the gutters\\
358 - when I could be surfing the beaches of Europe\\
359 - or-or cruising around on my hog?\\
360 - What hog?! Aha!\\
361 - Exactly! Where's my hog?!\\
362 - Where do you think you're going?\\
363 - I have had it!\\
364 - From now on, no one has to do anything.\\
365 - We can all just do whatever we want!\\
366 - And I want to take\\
367 - a bubble bath!\\
368 - Fine!\\
369 - So, that's a "yes" on the concert?\\
370 - Come on, come on.\\
371 - Are you gonna be in there all day?\\
372 - If I feel like it.\\
373 - Fine. Just so you know, when I'm done in the garage,\\
374 - I'm using the bathroom whether you're in here or not.\\
375 - Mom?\\
376 - I think we should go to Aunt Helen's funeral.\\
377 - I mean, she was a good woman.\\
378 - It's the least we can do.\\
379 - I don't know what you're trying to pull,\\
380 - Reese, but I don't like it.\\
381 - Am I the only one that cared about her?\\
382 - Yes, you're the good one.\\
383 - Enjoy your moment in the sun.\\
384 - Now, get out of here.\\
385 - This is me time.\\
386 - Hey, Reese, which one stinks more?\\
387 - What's your problem?!\\
388 - You couldn't keep your big mouth shut until after the funeral.\\
389 - Now I'll have to wait for another relative\\
390 - to die to bury this thing.\\
391 - It could be weeks!\\
392 - You'll think of something.\\
393 - No, I won't.\\
394 - You have good ideas all the time.\\
395 - But for me, this was special.\\
396 - Hey! You can't leave this mess here.\\
397 - I've got a guest coming over.\\
398 - Too bad. Thanks to you,\\
399 - no one has to do anything anymore.\\
400 - It's anarchy, baby.\\
401 - That's the word, right?\\
402 - Um... Mom?\\
403 - I was just wondering\\
404 - if you could wash this shirt for me?\\
405 - You must be joking.\\
406 - But you're the only one that knows how to use\\
407 - the washer and dryer without getting shocked.\\
408 - Please?\\
409 - Well... since you said please.\\
410 - Here you go.\\
411 - All washed.\\
412 - I think you've been in the garage long enough.\\
413 - Okay.\\
414 - Gosh!\\
415 - Well, no, no, no.\\
416 - You are gonna get your own outlet.\\
417 - Uh... okay, here we go.\\
418 - Okay... okay, here we are.\\
419 - Come on.\\
420 - Come on. God.\\
421 - Gotcha!\\
422 - Oh.\\
423 - No, not my problem today.\\
424 -     Well, I don't know why I came here tonight    \\
425 -     I got a feeling that something ain't right...    \\
426 - Hand me that loofah.\\
427 - He wants juice.\\
428 - Go get your own juice.\\
429 - You said I'm not supposed to.\\
430 - You're right.\\
431 - Okay, from now on,\\
432 - you are officially old enough to get your own juice.\\
433 - Poof.\\
434 -     Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you    \\
435 -     And I'm wondering what it is I should do...    \\
436 - Darn it.\\
437 - Darn it.\\
438 - Darn it.\\
439 - Mom!\\
440 - I spilled!\\
441 - So? Clean it up!\\
442 -     Jokers to the right, here I am    \\
443 -     Stuck in the middle with you    \\
444 -     Well, you started off with nothing...    \\
445 - Green apple soap.\\
446 - Girls like green apples, right?\\
447 - Oh, man, she got my pants wet, too!\\
448 -     Here I am, stuck in the middle with you...    \\
449 - Hello?\\
450 - Is Malcolm here?\\
451 - Is Malcolm here?!\\
452 - Huh?\\
453 - Malcolm!\\
454 - Malcolm?\\
455 - Julie! Nothing.\\
456 -     On the back and say please    \\
457 -     Please...    \\
458 - Oh, my God!\\
459 - Are you okay?\\
460 - I just wanted to be nice!\\
461 - People told me not to come to your house!\\
462 - But I thought they were just being silly!\\
463 - Julie, I'm sorry!\\
464 - Things aren't usually like this.\\
465 - Just give me a minute and I'll be ready to go.\\
466 - I don't want to go anymore!\\
467 - Just leave me alone!\\
468 -     Out of my chair    \\
469 -     And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs    \\
470 - How could you let her see me in my underwear?!\\
471 - Mom, this has gone too far!\\
472 - You have to do something!\\
473 - It's not supposed to be like this.\\
474 - We're not supposed to injure my friends.\\
475 - We're not supposed to let people see me in my underpants!\\
476 - We're supposed to be there for each other.\\
477 - Like when a family member dies,\\
478 - and we're supposed to go to their funeral?\\
479 - I'll be in my room.\\
480 - Then she slid into the trash and ran off.\\
481 - I swear, this whole family is falling apart.\\
482 - Oh, yes! I knew this moment would come.\\
483 - They don't have their scapegoat around,\\
484 - so everything goes to hell.\\
485 - No one realized that I'm the one who held this family together.\\
486 - Without me to blame everything on,\\
487 - they don't know what to do with themselves.\\
488 - A scapegoat... thanks.\\
489 - Mom thinks...\\
490 - He's right.\\
491 - This family needs a scapegoat.\\
492 - I started this, so I should be the one to end it.\\
493 - I did a terrible thing today.\\
494 - I tore this family apart.\\
495 - And I'm really sorry for that.\\
496 - But...\\
497 - it's not half as bad... as what Reese did!\\
498 - Oh, my God!\\
499 - I'm Mighty Man. Was this Dewey's present?\\
500 - Present?\\
501 - Reese, how could you?\\
502 - Do you know how expensive this was?\\
503 - Hal? I'm on it.\\
504 - That was a terrible thing to do\\
505 - to your little brother. There's more!\\
506 - He was gonna bury it with Aunt Helen!\\
507 - You were going to make Aunt Helen spend eternity\\
508 - with a crushed Mighty Man?\\
509 - A Mighty Man?\\
510 - I can't believe you!\\
511 - This is a whole new low, Reese.\\
512 - First of all, this is all circumstantial.\\
513 - I don't know how that thing got in my backpack.\\
514 - As for this Aunt Helen business, no one knows\\
515 - what I would've done at that funeral because we're not going.\\
516 - Who says we're not going?\\
517 - You did. Well, you can guess again.\\
518 - You are gonna march right up to that coffin,\\
519 - and apologize to that poor, dead woman.\\
520 - We all are.\\
521 - All right, everyone in the car as is.\\
522 - We'll have to drive creatively, but we might make the end.\\
523 - Let's go. Chop, chop! Here we go!\\
524 - Egg! Come on!\\
525 - Aunt Helen used to say...\\
526 - "Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone."\\
527 - And, uh, by the looks of today's turnout,\\
528 - I can see it wasn't just an idle threat.\\
529 - Yeah, Francis, your father's giving a speech.\\
530 - And it's actually kind of good.\\
531 - Can I get my phone back?\\
532 - I'm almost done, sweetie.\\
533 - Oh, Aunt Helen looks just lovely.\\
534 - You turn right back around, mister!\\
535 - You'll never guess what Reese did.\\
536 - Well, it's been a pretty productive day.\\
537 - I made Julie Rulerman hate me.\\
538 - Reese is gonna kill me the second we get home.\\
539 - And right now,\\
540 - Aunt Helen is personally bad-mouthing me to God.\\
541 - You want some more water, Uncle Louie?\\
542 - Sure.\\
543 - I need someone to put in a good word for me.

10 - Recess is over.\\
11 - I know.\\
12 - Malcolm, I think you should say something\\
13 - to your classmates.\\
14 - They stayed inside while you were out\\
15 - playing ball with your friends.\\
16 - Thanks.\\
17 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
18 -     I don't know    \\
19 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\

24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     Life is unfair.    \\
29 - I don't know why Mom makes me get up at 8:00.\\
30 - School doesn't even start till 8:15.\\
31 - What are you doing?\\
32 - Nothing.\\
33 - You look different.\\
34 - I took a shower.\\
35 - I knew it!\\
36 - ...on the state- legislature-sponsored initiative\\
37 - limiting the cabinet's attitude\\
38 - of overanalyzing past and current positions,\\
39 - aimed toward curbing this type of governmental interference.\\
40 - In international news, boring, boring, boring.\\
41 - I'm incredibly boring.\\
42 - Do you know who's boring? Me.\\
43 - Boring, goring, zoring, loring, doring, noring, foring.\\
44 - Why haven't you changed the channel yet?\\
45 - What? I took a shower.\\
46 - Is that a crime?\\
47 - Reese, is this going to be a daily thing?\\
48 - Because we got a schedule...\\
49 - Honey, let me handle this.\\
50 - Son, are you on drugs?\\
51 - No, it's just...\\
52 - Why doesn't everyone just leave me alone?!\\
53 - Wow. Usually we don't get someone storming off\\
54 - from the table until after pancakes.\\
55 - Hey, kids, it's a new,\\
56 - improved sleepy-time Herbie,\\
57 - now with super-sleepy fuzzy fur.\\
58 - I'm sleepy.\\
59 - Herbie's not available in stores.\\
60 - Order yours now\\
61 - through this special TV offer.\\
62 - Hi, Dewey.\\
63 - I can make you happy.\\
64 - I can make your brothers be nice to you.\\
65 - I can get you out of school.\\
66 - Your parents want to buy me for you.\\
67 - All you got to do is ask them.\\
68 - They're right there in the kitchen.\\
69 - Why don't you go ask them?\\
70 - Go on. Yeah.\\
71 - Go ask them.\\
72 - Can you buy me a Herbie?\\
73 - No, they're too expensive.\\
74 - Maybe. Ask me again in four seconds.\\
75 - Can you buy me a Herbie, please?\\
76 - Didn't you just hear me?\\
77 - I said no.\\
78 - Ask louder.\\
79 - Son, what were you thinking?!\\
80 - Stealing 200 frogs from the biology lab\\
81 - and setting them loose on the highway!\\
82 - I was freeing the alleged frog, sir.\\
83 - Killing live animals in the name of science is inhumane.\\
84 - No! Inhumane is sitting in a car\\
85 - for two and a half hours\\
86 - when I live only eight blocks from campus.\\
87 - Sir, I didn't mean to...\\
88 - I am very tired\\
89 - of all the things that you didn't mean to do.\\
90 - You didn't mean to come in four hours after curfew.\\
91 - You didn't mean to replace the morning reveille record\\
92 - with a selection from trip-hop wizard Tricky.\\
93 - Maybe I should just rename this\\
94 - "Francis's 'I didn't mean to' file."\\
95 - That would be a bold choice, sir.\\
96 - Glibness.\\
97 - What a surprise.\\
98 - I'm giving you exactly ten seconds to tell me\\
99 - why I shouldn't put you on latrine detail\\
100 - for the rest of this semester.\\
101 - Okay. Um, why shouldn't I have to clean toilets\\
102 - for the next three months?\\
103 - It's an intriguing question.\\
104 - Is that a new tie, sir?\\
105 - Four seconds.\\
106 - What a beautiful beach.\\
107 - Did you take this, sir? 'Cause...\\
108 - you've certainly captured your young male friend's Speedo.\\
109 - That is a picture of me.\\
110 - Now, if I were you,\\
111 - I wouldn't try to distract me and...\\
112 - Sir?\\
113 - Sir?\\
114 - Hmm?\\
115 - That'll be all, Cadet.\\
116 - Were you crying?\\
117 - No, I was reading.\\
118 - You don't read.\\
119 - Just shut the door, Krelboyne.\\
120 - I'm still in here, perv!\\
121 - Ha! You're crying.\\
122 - Oh, man. You're crying.\\
123 - You don't want to talk about it, do you?\\
124 - It's about a girl.\\
125 - I should've just walked away.\\
126 - Wendy Finnerman-- she hates me.\\
127 - I don't know what to do.\\
128 - I've tried everything to make her like me.\\
129 - I'm toilet-papering her house tonight.\\
130 - If that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas.\\
131 - Look, Reese, maybe I can help you.\\
132 - What am I supposed to do?\\
133 - I don't know.\\
134 - Just try anything that doesn't make her cry.\\
135 - I guess you could start off\\
136 - by finding out stuff about her.\\
137 - You know, do the things she likes to do.\\
138 - Is that before or after I go T.P. her house?\\
139 - Instead.\\
140 - All right.\\
141 - I'll try it your way.\\
142 - Thanks.\\
143 - No problem.\\
144 - I know I'm going to pay for this, but...\\
145 - Reese loves Wendy.\\
146 - Reese loves Wendy.\\
147 - Come here! Stay here! Ha-ha!\\
148 - Go Wildcats, go!\\
149 - Go Wildcats, go, go!\\
150 - Go Wildcats, go, go!\\
151 - Go Wildcats, go, go!\\
152 - That's it.\\
153 - Reese!\\
154 - Reese, why are you dressed like that?!\\
155 - I figured out what she likes.\\
156 - I saw her cheering for the football team,\\
157 - so I joined the cheerleading squad.\\
158 - Why didn't you join the football team, doofus?\\
159 - She's a cheerleader.\\
160 - Reese, you're a guy.\\
161 - Guy cheerleaders are the lowest of the low,\\
162 - worse than band, worse than Krelboynes.\\
163 - The only thing lower is that guy\\
164 - that never takes his hand out of his butt.\\
165 - Oh, Chester?\\
166 - He's a cheerleader, too.\\
167 - Does a lot of solo work.\\
168 - I tried to help him.\\
169 - I gave him advice.\\
170 - I tried reasoning with him.\\
171 - There's only one thing left to do:\\
172 - sit back and laugh my ass off.\\
173 - Good luck.\\
174 - Come in, Cadet.\\
175 - Look, sir...\\
176 - I have the floor.\\
177 - In the short time that you have been under my care,\\
178 - we have had our share of conflicts.\\
179 - In all my efforts to get through to you,\\
180 - I have tried every method I know how.\\
181 - And besides mental and physical abuse, sir,\\
182 - exactly which methods would those be?\\
183 - This photo made me realize something.\\
184 - I used to be like you.\\
185 - Insolent, arrogant, cavalier.\\
186 - Sir, I... Floor!\\
187 - Now, son, you are\\
188 - on the precipice.\\
189 - Now, I am going to tell you a story\\
190 - about my life, in the hopes of finally getting you\\
191 - to straighten yourself out.\\
192 - Now, in the coming hours, you are going to hear things\\
193 - that are going to horrify you.\\
194 - It sounds illuminating, sir, but I have biology.\\
195 - I've taken the liberty\\
196 - of canceling your next three classes.\\
197 - Son, do you know what a wet nurse is?\\
198 - Dewey, have you forgotten me? I thought we were friends.\\
199 - All of the boys and girls\\
200 - on your street are my friends.\\
201 - They all bought me.\\
202 - Your parents have lots of money.\\
203 - They're just hiding it.\\
204 - But I don't want you to buy me for me.\\
205 - It's for your own good.\\
206 - I didn't want to tell you this,\\
207 - but if you don't buy me, you'll die.\\
208 - Honestly, Hal, I don't know what's wrong with Reese.\\
209 - Oh, he's just a little slow.\\
210 - No. I mean the way he's been acting.\\
211 - Hey, Mom, where's the iron?\\
212 - Ah.\\
213 - It's a girl. It's a girl.\\
214 - Hal, it's time for the talk.\\
215 - I don't know what you mean.\\
216 - The talk, Hal.\\
217 - Oh, geez, he's a little young, don't you think?\\
218 - You waited so long with Francis; look what happened there.\\
219 - All right, but if I'm giving the talk,\\
220 - all three boys are getting it at the same time.\\
221 - And I'm not doing it again.\\
222 - So if we have any more kids, they're on their own.\\
223 - Mom, Dad, I'd really like a Herbie doll.\\
224 - I know it's expensive, but I don't ask for a lot.\\
225 - And I've been very good lately.\\
226 - I want it! I want it! I want it! I want it!\\
227 - I want it! I want it! I want it!\\
228 - Looks like he found the sugar.\\
229 - Oh, doesn't he look just like a little dust mop?\\
230 - Ready? Hit it.\\
231 - B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!\\
232 - B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!\\
233 - What's that spell?\\
234 - Be aggressive!\\
235 - B-E aggressive!\\
236 - V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.\\
237 - That's the Wildcats' battle cry!\\
238 - What a... geek.\\
239 - I never thought...\\
240 - I'd get... to say that.\\
241 - Oh, my God.\\
242 - I'm a Krelboyne with a brother who's a cheerleader.\\
243 - I could wet my pants in public,\\
244 - and it would be a lateral move.\\
245 - ...O-R-Y.\\
246 - That's the Wildcats' battle cry!\\
247 - Success!\\
248 - Victory, success!\\
249 - Victory, yes!\\
250 - Ow! Ow!\\
251 - So clumsy.\\
252 - Hey, Malcolm,\\
253 - you think your brother will lend me his corset?\\
254 - When a Krelboyne makes fun of you,\\
255 - you know you're in trouble.\\
256 - See, that comment was playing off the concept\\
257 - that we all have specific notions\\
258 - of gender-appropriate roles.\\
259 - At least they're no good at it.\\
260 - So there we were--\\
261 - the ocean, my stepfather and me.\\
262 - As the storm raged overhead,\\
263 - he made one final lunge for the rudder.\\
264 - I ripped it from his hands and stared him down.\\
265 - He knew that I was prepared to kill him.\\
266 - I left port\\
267 - that day a 16-year-old boy.\\
268 - I returned a man.\\
269 - That was an amazing story, sir.\\
270 - I mean, I was skeptical at first,\\
271 - but we do have something in common.\\
272 - I mean, look at the way both our mothers abandoned us.\\
273 - What are you talking about?\\
274 - You know, how I was shipped off here\\
275 - and you were left with your wet nurse for all those years.\\
276 - That story had nothing to do with my mother.\\
277 - It had to do with me finally taking responsibility\\
278 - for my own actions.\\
279 - Just sounded like she may have been a little bit distant.\\
280 - Well, that is none of your business.\\
281 - I swear, you are absolutely fixated on mothers.\\
282 - I am not fixated.\\
283 - Can you name one thing in your life\\
284 - that you don't blame on your mother?\\
285 - Sure.\\
286 - I'm sorry. I was just giving an opinion!\\
287 - Well, it's that pop psychology nonsense that's...\\
288 - It is nothing to get defensive about.\\
289 - I am not defensive.\\
290 - Every time anybody denies a lie,\\
291 - they're called defensive.\\
292 - Fine. I take it back. Your mother was a saint.\\
293 - I am not saying that at all.\\
294 - Does this look anything like a "Q"?\\
295 - Reese, just stop this.\\
296 - You're acting like a moron.\\
297 - And you're making no progress with Wendy.\\
298 - And what the hell do you need a "Q" for anyway?\\
299 - You're right. I'm terrible.\\
300 - I'm just not coordinated unless I'm hitting somebody.\\
301 - But I really like her.\\
302 - I have to get good.\\
303 - Listen to the words.\\
304 - Good. Boy. Cheerleader.\\
305 - Quit while you still have some dignity.\\
306 - Oh, and let her think I'm a quitter?\\
307 - You can't even remember a simple six-step routine.\\
308 - There's six steps?\\
309 - Yes. It's just right, left, right, left, reverse, pose.\\
310 - You remember that from just watching?\\
311 - You guys did it, like, ten times.\\
312 - So...\\
313 - you know my routine?\\
314 - It's not that hard.\\
315 - But... you know my routine.\\
316 - Yes, I do.\\
317 - Look, I know where this is going, and...\\
318 - No, you don't.\\
319 - You're going to help me.\\
320 - That is where I was going.\\
321 - Oh. Good. Let's get started.\\
322 - No! Oh, come on, you have to.\\
323 - No. Don't you know how embarrassing\\
324 - that could be for me?\\
325 - I know what's more embarrassing. What?\\
326 - Getting beaten into a coma by a good boy cheerleader.\\
327 - My mother was neither a Madonna or a whore!\\
328 - She was a damn fine woman!\\
329 - Stick your arms out!\\
330 - We have to sell this!\\
331 - Can you move your hand a little to the left?\\
332 - Spread your legs!\\
333 - No!\\
334 - I said spread your legs!\\
335 - No!\\
336 - It's time for the talk, Hal.\\
337 - Come on, spread your legs!\\
338 - I'm not spreading my legs!\\
339 - Fight, fight, fight! Fight harder!\\
340 - Wildcats, help us out, fight!\\
341 - Fight, fight, fight!\\
342 - Fight harder!\\
343 - Wildcats, help us out, fight!\\
344 - We got spirit! Wildcats, we got spirit!\\
345 - Wildcats, we got what? What, what, what?\\
346 - What, what, what, what, what, what, what?\\
347 - We got spirit!\\
348 - Wildcats, we got spirit!\\
349 - Wildcats, we got what? What, what, what?\\
350 - What, what, what, what, what, what, what?\\
351 - We got spirit!\\
352 - Yes. Yes.\\
353 - Reese, that was incredible.\\
354 - Who's been helping you on your spirit kicks?\\
355 - Come on, Reese, I really have to go!\\
356 - I'm the most worthless, putrid loser in the world.\\
357 - Everybody hates me.\\
358 - I hate me.\\
359 - Your brother in there?\\
360 - Where else?\\
361 - Reese? Come on out. We need to have a talk.\\
362 - Finally.\\
363 - No, Malcolm, you're in on this talk, too.\\
364 - Me? Why do I have to be here?\\
365 - Relax-- it's going to be far worse for me\\
366 - than it is for you.\\
367 - Boys, this talk\\
368 - is very important,\\
369 - so I need your undivided attention.\\
370 - It's very important\\
371 - that you be bored and squirm a lot.\\
372 - Now, I want to tell you about what happens\\
373 - when a boy really, really likes a girl.\\
374 - And, Dewey, I'll try to make this easy for you to understand.\\
375 - Ah.\\
376 - Aw, man, I still play with that.\\
377 - Here we go.\\
378 - You see, there's a certain thing that happens\\
379 - between normal, healthy people.\\
380 - It's called chemistry.\\
381 - Well, that doesn't happen.\\
382 - Except maybe the first time.\\
383 - What does happen\\
384 - is this.\\
385 - I like you.\\
386 - I like you, too.\\
387 - And if they love each other\\
388 - and take the proper precautions, they'll have sex.\\
389 - But I've told you about that already.\\
390 - Not me.\\
391 - Well, ask your brothers.\\
392 - Now, unfortunately, if the boy is from our family,\\
393 - it goes a little more like this.\\
394 - I like you.\\
395 - I hate you!\\
396 - Now I love you!\\
397 - Leave me alone!\\
398 - Your insane neediness is driving me away!\\
399 - Look at me! Look at me!\\
400 - Look, oh, I'm crazy! Look-it!\\
401 - Ooh! Ooh! Pay attention to me!\\
402 - Look at me! Look at me! I'm crazy!\\
403 - I'm an idiot! I'm an idiot!\\
404 - Watch me crash and burn!\\
405 - There's no explaining it.\\
406 - It's hereditary.\\
407 - And it goes back for generations.\\
408 - Francis has it, so does Uncle Pete.\\
409 - It's why your great grandpa went to work\\
410 - on that oil rig in Peru.\\
411 - All I know is your mother must carry\\
412 - some sort of internal antidote,\\
413 - because, through some fluke, I was lucky enough to get her.\\
414 - I just wanted you boys to know what you were in for.\\
415 - There was so much I wanted to tell her...\\
416 - but she was gone.\\
417 - And I... I...\\
418 - Come on, sir.\\
419 - Just say it.\\
420 - I hated her!\\
421 - All these issues with my mother.\\
422 - I know now that this was not an accident.\\
423 - You know, talking with you has helped me\\
424 - work out some things with my own family.\\
425 - I mean, all those years I blamed my parents\\
426 - for every senseless act of self-destruction.\\
427 - And all this time, I was at least partially responsible\\
428 - for a couple of them.\\
429 - You know, it really means a lot to me\\
430 - to know that I can come to you when I need to talk.\\
431 - Familiarity breeds contempt, Cadet.\\
432 - What are you doing?\\
433 - What's the point?\\
434 - You heard Dad. I'm doomed!\\
435 - You can't quit! I've worked too hard for you to quit now!\\
436 - I hate to inform you, brain boy,\\
437 - it's not about you, it's about me.\\
438 - That's before I spent an entire day\\
439 - with your hand on my ass!\\
440 - You owe me!\\
441 - I can't help you.\\
442 - Yes, you can!\\
443 - You can break the cycle Dad was talking about!\\
444 - You have to talk to Wendy!\\
445 - I can't! I freeze up!\\
446 - Do you want to end up like Francis? Or Uncle Pete?\\
447 - I don't care anymore!\\
448 - Anything's better than this!\\
449 - Even marrying Mom?\\
450 - Dewey, your mother and I want to talk to you.\\
451 - You're a good boy.\\
452 - But in life,\\
453 - being good doesn't always\\
454 - get you the things you want.\\
455 - I guess what I'm trying to say is\\
456 - that when your mother and I don't buy you a toy,\\
457 - it doesn't mean that we don't love you.\\
458 - Hmm?\\
459 - You just have to learn that disappointment\\
460 - is all part of being a grown-up.\\
461 - But, luckily, you're not a grown-up yet!\\
462 - Ta-da!\\
463 - Wow!\\
464 - Oh, come on, how cute is that?\\
465 - Break me.\\
466 - Okay.\\
467 - Okay, second row.\\
468 - Okay, ready? Here we go.\\
469 - I... I...\\
470 - Did you say something?\\
471 - Wendy, I really like you.\\
472 - Like when a boy likes a girl-- normal and healthy.\\
473 - I'm sorry for hurting you all those times.\\
474 - I'm really not a bad guy.\\
475 - Anyways... thanks.\\
476 - I like you, too.\\
477 - Really?\\
478 - Yeah.\\
479 - I even kind of liked your bad boy side, too.\\
480 - Oh, my God!\\
481 - Call...\\
482 - nine...\\
483 - one...\\
484 - Hello, Mother?\\
485 - It's Edwin.\\
486 - Yes, it has been a long time.\\
487 - So be sure to try\\
488 - the new and improved Chip-A-Roo cookie today.\\
489 - I can make you taller, I can make you better-looking.\\
490 - If you eat enough of me, I can make you president,\\
491 - maybe even emperor of the world.\\
492 - Honey, can you buy me a box of these cookies?\\
493 - Make it two.\\
494 - Make it two boxes.

1 - This isn't fair. Yes, it is.\\
2 - It's absolutely fair.\\
3 - I'm getting hungry.\\
4 - We're doing it my way.\\
5 - They're getting cold.\\
6 - You want them divided up fairly or not?\\
7 - You have more than me. No, I don't.\\
8 - We all have 29 inches of fries so far.\\
9 - I have two four-inchers, five three-inchers\\
10 - and three two-inchers.\\
11 - You have five five-inchers and a four-incher.\\
12 - They're exactly the same.\\
13 - Dewey!\\
14 - Okay, we're going to assume\\
15 - this was a four-incher from the share pile.\\
16 - 117 minus three,\\
17 - times 29, divided by three, minus...\\
18 - We each take a two-inch bite out of this one.\\
19 - Last week, we had curly fries.\\
20 - It took us three hours.\\
21 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
22 -     I don't know    \\
23 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     And you're not so big    \\
32 -     Life is unfair.    \\
33 - Good job, Don!\\
34 - Center it!\\
35 - Aw, man.\\
36 - He's wide open!\\
37 - Shoot, shoot! There it is!\\
38 - In your... face.\\
39 - I got it, I got it!\\
40 - Car!\\
41 - Good... game.\\
42 - This... sucks.\\
43 - You... mocking me?\\
44 - No... tired.\\
45 - Get... skates.\\
46 - Can't.\\
47 - Dad.\\
48 - My dad was some kind of skating champion\\
49 - a long time ago.\\
50 - He made a rule-- no one in the family\\
51 - could buy skates until after they take lessons from him.\\
52 - So take... the lessons.\\
53 - You don't get it.\\
54 - My dad's, like, a total fanatic about skating.\\
55 - He doesn't even call it skating.\\
56 - He calls it...\\
57 - "The Brotherhood of the Wheel."\\
58 - He taught Francis and Reese,\\
59 - and they've never been the same after.\\
60 - Gretzky shoots!\\
61 - He scores!\\
62 - He laughs at the other Canadians!\\
63 - Hey, Reese, remember when Dad taught you\\
64 - how to skate?\\
65 - I don't want to talk about it.\\
66 - Why can't you just tell me what it was like?\\
67 - One, I'm not supposed to,\\
68 - and two, I don't even like to think about it.\\
69 - It makes me cry.\\
70 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
71 - What's wrong with you?\\
72 - You know you're not supposed to skate in the house.\\
73 - Why? Everyone else in the world gets to.\\
74 - Wait a minute. Somebody stepped in something.\\
75 - Oh, my God.\\
76 - Oh, my God! What a mess!\\
77 - Reese...\\
78 - what did you roll in?\\
79 - Oh, man.\\
80 - You have to admit, it is kind of funny--\\
81 - yelling so loud you actually throw out your back.\\
82 - Just try to relax.\\
83 - Got the baby monitor all set up here.\\
84 - Now, if you need anything, just holler--\\
85 - but not too loud--\\
86 - and I will get on it.\\
87 - Oh, God.\\
88 - Sorry. Sorry. Oh, God.\\
89 - Lois, why don't you just take the pain medicine\\
90 - the doctor gave you?\\
91 - Because they make me loopy.\\
92 - I will not have this house come crashing down around me\\
93 - because I'm hopped up on goofballs.\\
94 - Mom, I'm really sorry.\\
95 - Are you okay?\\
96 - Oh, Reese, come to mama.\\
97 - Closer, sweetheart.\\
98 - Are you happy you crippled your mother?\\
99 - Mom...\\
100 - Are you?\\
101 - Mom. Mom. Ow!\\
102 - Survival weekend?\\
103 - What does that mean?\\
104 - That means we get to spend\\
105 - two whole days out in the wilderness\\
106 - with limited supplies and no food.\\
107 - You're kidding, right?\\
108 - No.\\
109 - It's an excellent way to learn basic survival techniques.\\
110 - It's two days in the woods.\\
111 - Our parents are paying for room and board.\\
112 - Where does that money go?\\
113 - Sounds like a big scam.\\
114 - Maybe so, but you're doing it.\\
115 - What?\\
116 - Francis, I let you\\
117 - blow off a lot of things around here,\\
118 - but this is something I believe in.\\
119 - It's a character builder.\\
120 - I think it'll be good for you.\\
121 - How could it be good for me?\\
122 - No food, no shelter.\\
123 - No broken clavicles.\\
124 - That's something inside me, right?\\
125 - What are you doing?!\\
126 - Nothing.\\
127 - Get a glass.\\
128 - Don't you dare!\\
129 - When I get well, I am going\\
130 - to beat you blue, mister.\\
131 - Get a glass!\\
132 - All right. Okay.\\
133 - Can I have some milk?\\
134 - Yes, but get a glass.\\
135 - Okay.\\
136 - Hello, Francis.\\
137 - I have a problem.\\
138 - I need your advice.\\
139 - Trust me, pal, whatever you're going through\\
140 - is not half as bad as what I'm facing.\\
141 - I'm thinking of asking Dad for skating lessons.\\
142 - Why does everyone do that?\\
143 - What does he do?\\
144 - Look, if I told you, you'd just freak out,\\
145 - but if you think you're ready,\\
146 - my advice is to get it over with quickly.\\
147 - It's like pulling a giant Band-Aid off your crotch.\\
148 - I'm going to have a Band-Aid on my crotch?\\
149 - Who are you talking to?\\
150 - Francis.\\
151 - Hi, sweetie.\\
152 - Hi, Mom. Oh, I am in such pain because of my back.\\
153 - Doctor says I have to stay in bed for at least three days Mom...\\
154 - with my leg up on a pillow\\
155 - and then I'm supposed to put ice on it.\\
156 - Ice, not heat. Look, Mom.\\
157 - Have you ever heard of such a thing?\\
158 - I never heard of such a thing.\\
159 - That doesn't make any sense to me.\\
160 - Oh, thanks, honey.\\
161 - Here we go.\\
162 - One more thing. Huh?\\
163 - Yeah?\\
164 - Stop trying to drug my food.\\
165 - Oh.\\
166 - Where was I?\\
167 - Francis?\\
168 - Where wa...?\\
169 - Uh, your back.\\
170 - Oh, yeah.\\
171 - So they say that my fourth\\
172 - and fifth vertebrae are out of alignment.\\
173 - Apparently my shoulder muscles are asymmetrical.\\
174 - I mean, did you ever hear of such a thing?\\
175 - They say it's genetic.\\
176 - It's the first case of scream-induced\\
177 - back trauma they've ever seen.\\
178 - I swear, they paraded every Tom, Dick and Harry\\
179 - through that room to take a look at me.\\
180 - And me, I'm just lying there\\
181 - with that little flimsy paper thing on me\\
182 - with my rear end flapping in the breeze for all the world to see.\\
183 - Boys, they're called...\\
184 - Gut-busters.\\
185 - They take a sausage, stuff it with cheese,\\
186 - wrap it with bacon,\\
187 - and shove it in a deep-fat fryer\\
188 - full of lard.\\
189 - They're indescribable.\\
190 - Bon appetit.\\
191 - Malcolm, where have you been?\\
192 - You got to get in on this.\\
193 - Dad... I want skating lessons.\\
194 - Son, do you know, once you start\\
195 - there's no going back?\\
196 - I know.\\
197 - This means total commitment.\\
198 - Once you begin the path,\\
199 - there is no leaving the path.\\
200 - Are you sure you're ready for that?\\
201 - I mean really ready?\\
202 - I-I guess so.\\
203 - Neat.\\
204 - We'll start tomorrow.\\
205 - Come on, dig in before they harden.\\
206 - Let's do it.\\
207 - Stretch.\\
208 - Nose to knees, nose to knees,\\
209 - and... release.\\
210 - Ooh.\\
211 - You feeling a little limber now?\\
212 - Mostly I feel sleepy.\\
213 - Well, we have to start early.\\
214 - We've got a lot of ground to cover.\\
215 - Rule number one:\\
216 - you can't question my ways.\\
217 - I'm the top skate-dog.\\
218 - Understood?\\
219 - You may not like my methods,\\
220 - but let me just show you what you can accomplish\\
221 - if you stick with it.\\
222 - Should I be impressed or horrified?\\
223 - Dad, that was unbelievable.\\
224 - Whew! That routine won me a gold medal, a macram   plant hanger,\\
225 - and your mother's heart, all in the same afternoon.\\
226 - What to see your skates?\\
227 - Yeah.\\
228 - Come on.\\
229 - I prefer a Saratoga four-wide,\\
230 - but I know you kids like that\\
231 - in-line stuff.\\
232 - So...\\
233 - Whoa! They're beautiful!\\
234 - They are, aren't they?\\
235 - Wait, I don't get to wear them?\\
236 - Oh, no... you're not ready for those just yet.\\
237 - That's just your incentive.\\
238 - One step at a time, Malcolm.\\
239 - Roll to the gold. Huh?\\
240 - You're going to start with these.\\
241 - Why do I have to... Ah-ah-ah.\\
242 - Top skate-dog.\\
243 - Now, let's see you skate through those cones.\\
244 - I don't have skates.\\
245 - Your skates are in here.\\
246 - Go on.\\
247 - Glide... and glide...\\
248 - let your arms work with-- slow down.\\
249 - Slower. Slower!\\
250 - This is going to rule.\\
251 - All I'm taking is a canteen,\\
252 - a knife, my bedroll and some emergency rations.\\
253 - Wuss.\\
254 - Canteen, knife, survival blanket.\\
255 - That's all?\\
256 - Dude, hard-core.\\
257 - Let's rock.\\
258 - You ready? Ready as I'll ever be.\\
259 - What is it?\\
260 - My back.\\
261 - I can't move.\\
262 - It happens sometimes.\\
263 - It's genetic.\\
264 - My shoulder muscles are asymmetrical,\\
265 - and it pulls my vertebrae out of alignment.\\
266 - I'll be fine.\\
267 - I just need to ice it.\\
268 - Which vertebrae?\\
269 - Fourth and fifth.\\
270 - All right.\\
271 - Take him to his room.\\
272 - Hands out front so you get a balance.\\
273 - Hold it... hold it.\\
274 - Why am I doing this?\\
275 - Stop clouding your mind.\\
276 - This is a process.\\
277 - Dad, it's street hockey, not clown school.\\
278 - Process... and one and down and over.\\
279 - When am I ever going to use this?\\
280 - Full range of motion,\\
281 - and point and bump, and point and bump,\\
282 - and point and bump,\\
283 - and then we glide.\\
284 - How about my skates?\\
285 - Can I at least try on my skates?\\
286 - Absolutely not.\\
287 - You need at least two more days.\\
288 - Two days?\\
289 - Uh-huh.\\
290 - I know enough\\
291 - to play a stupid game of street hockey now.\\
292 - That's all I care about.\\
293 - Malcolm, we go at the speed I say.\\
294 - This is about safety and proper technique.\\
295 - But it doesn't make any sense.\\
296 - That's because you're not in a skating state of mind.\\
297 - Now, that's it. Okay?\\
298 - We're done. Go home.\\
299 - You know what?\\
300 - Thanks to your attitude,\\
301 - we are now a day behind.\\
302 - Fine!\\
303 - The boy's fighting me, Lois.\\
304 - Oh, he's got the talent, but he's reckless and wild.\\
305 - Fine. I'll talk to him.\\
306 - That's not what I'm asking.\\
307 - Well, that's what going to ha...\\
308 - Would you just take the darn pill... dear?\\
309 - I can't believe he cut me off.\\
310 - You questioned his ways.\\
311 - Never question his ways.\\
312 - That just makes it take even longer.\\
313 - You going to go play hockey? You bet.\\
314 - I'll see you out there...\\
315 - in a month or two.\\
316 - I don't know how yet,\\
317 - but there's definitely a way I can justify this.\\
318 - Malcolm!\\
319 - Dang, I thought I'd at least\\
320 - get a few minutes in before he busted me.\\
321 - You know what? Screw it.\\
322 - I'm sick of this.\\
323 - What do you think you're doing?\\
324 - Taking my skates to go play hockey.\\
325 - Absolutely not; we had an agreement.\\
326 - Agreement?\\
327 - You just like bossing me around!\\
328 - And you like fighting me every step of the way!\\
329 - Because you're treating me like a baby!\\
330 - The stuff you're teaching me is stupid.\\
331 - Okay, that's it.\\
332 - You just lost these, pal.\\
333 - Oh, yeah? Well...\\
334 - ...you.\\
335 - You heard me.\\
336 - Modeling isn't all glamour.\\
337 - Sometimes you have to act like it's hot when it's really cold.\\
338 - People don't realize how hard we work...\\
339 - I am the only one who truly understands you, Inga.\\
340 - I cannot believe you said that to Dad.\\
341 - Oh, and by the way--\\
342 - if you pass Francis on your way to Siberia,\\
343 - tell him I said hi.\\
344 - Do you think he told Mom?\\
345 - I wouldn't worry about that.\\
346 - Mom's feeling a lot better.\\
347 - Dr. Reese paid her a little visit.\\
348 - What are you talking about?\\
349 - Let's just say, pills and sandwich-- not effective;\\
350 - pills and milk-- effective.\\
351 - I just, I just don't get it.\\
352 - I mean, I have always been the good parent.\\
353 - That's true.\\
354 - I'm the nice one.\\
355 - Yeah, that's true.\\
356 - You're the bad one.\\
357 - The system can't work with two bad cops.\\
358 - Oh, I hate cops.\\
359 - Cops, eh...\\
360 - You know what else I hate?\\
361 - Those what-do-you- call-thems? Those, uh...\\
362 - I just wasn't ready for this from Malcolm. ...soap salesmen.\\
363 - Not yet. But he stepped over the line\\
364 - and I don't think there's any way back.\\
365 - I mean, it's not as if\\
366 - I caught him with a cigarette\\
367 - and can make him smoke a whole carton.\\
368 - You know what? I hate bigots, too.\\
369 - Oh, I hate bigots.\\
370 - Malcolm has always been different.\\
371 - God, why can't he be like his brothers?\\
372 - Reese took a swing at me, Francis took a swing at me--\\
373 - that I can deal with.\\
374 - Block, chop, they're on the ground gasping for air.\\
375 - It's over with.\\
376 - But this is like... words.\\
377 - I mean, you know what I hate the most of all?\\
378 - I hate those gigantic pink...\\
379 - Oh, thank God.\\
380 -        \\
381 -        \\
382 - Smoking!\\
383 - Uh, Houston, we are good to go.\\
384 - Uh, roger that.\\
385 - You are good to go in five, four, three, two, one.\\
386 - Go!\\
387 - Whoo!\\
388 - Hey... fellas!\\
389 - Boy, has it been two days already?\\
390 - How was it, huh?\\
391 - You just missed the big fire.\\
392 - But, um, luckily I was here to put it out.\\
393 - Can I offer you some cookie dough?\\
394 - Come on, guys, let's be reasonable.\\
395 - I can't spend two days in the woods tied to a chair.\\
396 - Three days-- one extra for lying.\\
397 - Well, at least lend me a jacket! Or some food!\\
398 - Dudes, come on!\\
399 - You can't leave me out here with nothing!\\
400 - That was to me, not at me, right?!\\
401 - Hal.\\
402 - Honey, what are you doing up?\\
403 - Don't you "honey" me.\\
404 - You slipped me drugs.\\
405 - Oh!\\
406 - You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\\
407 - getting Reese to sandbag me like that.\\
408 - "Would you like some milk, Mother?"\\
409 - The kid's never brought me one thing in his entire life.\\
410 - And don't think I can't smell those Gut-busters\\
411 - coming out of your pores.\\
412 - You are back on rice cakes, mister,\\
413 - starting now!\\
414 - Boys, your mother's mobile.\\
415 - Malcolm, I need to see you in the backyard.\\
416 - Now, you said what you said, and we can't change that.\\
417 - And it isn't the kind of thing that could be solved\\
418 - with an apology or a simple punishment.\\
419 - But we do need to find a way to get past this. Agreed?\\
420 - I guess so.\\
421 - Good. Now, here's how I see it:\\
422 - this whole thing stems from you feeling like\\
423 - I treat you like a child.\\
424 - So...\\
425 - what's this?\\
426 - That is ten pages, single-spaced,\\
427 - of filthy name calling.\\
428 - What?!\\
429 - They get worse as they go along.\\
430 - What am I supposed to do with this?\\
431 - Well, since you think you're old enough\\
432 - to use these kind of words,\\
433 - I think you're old enough to see the effect they have.\\
434 - Malcolm, you are going to look me in the eye\\
435 - and say every last one of these terrible things\\
436 - to the man who held you in his arms\\
437 - the moment you were born.\\
438 - But, Dad...\\
439 - Uh-uh, I'm not your dad; I'm, uh, here...\\
440 - A stinkin' son of a...\\
441 - To my face.\\
442 - Continue.\\
443 -        \\
444 - I can't.\\
445 - You see, son? Words hurt.\\
446 - That's why you have to use them carefully.\\
447 - I understand, Dad.\\
448 - I'm sorry.\\
449 - Okay. I think you've had enough.\\
450 - No, wait. I can make it through the whole list.\\
451 - I'm not going to let you down again.\\
452 -        \\
453 - Hole.\\
454 - Good.\\
455 - Very thorough.\\
456 - Dad, will you please finish teaching me how to skate?\\
457 - Of course.\\
458 - But let's not make eye contact for a couple weeks.\\
459 - You got it.\\
460 - Aw, man.\\
461 - Come on.\\
462 - I know I look like an idiot, but I'm kickin' ass!
\subsection {Episode 14: The Bots And The Bees}
1 - I got one!\\
2 - Yes, yes. Cool.\\
3 - Get him!\\
4 - Ugh.\\
5 - I got one!\\
6 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
7 -     I don't know    \\
8 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     Life is unfair.    \\
18 - Okay, give me the tape.\\
19 - What if we get caught?\\
20 - Don't worry about it. No one's home.\\
21 - I cued it up to the best part.\\
22 - It's BattleBots,\\
23 - and it's a free for all at the battle area.\\
24 - All of these heavyweight..\\
25 - I thought this was porno.\\
26 - Ew. No, this is better.\\
27 - And no one's... excluded.\\
28 - Come on, this is the lamest thing I've...\\
29 - Oh, my God, is that real?\\
30 - It's an open competition.\\
31 - People build killer robots, put them in a ring,\\
32 - and see which one comes out alive.\\
33 - Killer robots?!\\
34 - I can't believe it.\\
35 - Finally something cool about being smart.\\
36 - I wish we could do that.\\
37 - We were hoping you'd say that.\\
38 - Here's the deal:\\
39 - we want to enter the competition.\\
40 - We've got the designs, we've got the desire,\\
41 - and we're not distracted by any kind of social life.\\
42 - The only problem is that our parents would never allow us\\
43 - to build something that dangerous.\\
44 - That means we need a place\\
45 - with a total lack of caring adult supervision.\\
46 - That's my house!\\
47 - But those things look really expensive.\\
48 - No problem.\\
49 - My father tries to buy my love.\\
50 - Who's your... daddy?\\
51 - Push. What are the odds, huh?\\
52 - Of Francis having an emergency appendectomy\\
53 - two months after using the same excuse to ditch school?\\
54 - Well, he was never very lucky.\\
55 - Oh, I need you to call work\\
56 - and tell them I won't be coming in.\\
57 - Will do.\\
58 - Well, there's my cab.\\
59 - What's that all about?\\
60 - A little something to remember me by.\\
61 - You know, it just occurred to me\\
62 - that we have not been apart for one night in 18 years.\\
63 - You gonna be okay with that?\\
64 - I think I can manage\\
65 - without my mommy for a few days.\\
66 - I told you that baby voice creeps me out.\\
67 - Sorry.\\
68 - Ten-hut! Well, Cadet,\\
69 - I see you survived. Yes, sir.\\
70 - I brought you a little something\\
71 - to take your mind off the pain.\\
72 - This is a good opportunity for you\\
73 - to catch up on your homework.\\
74 - Take it from me--\\
75 - a lengthy hospital stay is the perfect environment\\
76 - to focus your mind and attack weaknesses in your character.\\
77 - If it hadn't been for this,\\
78 - I never would've learned conversational French.\\
79 - Carry on.\\
80 - Sorry, man.\\
81 - I was this close to going medieval on him.\\
82 - You feeling okay?\\
83 - I feel like I have a belly full of broken glass.\\
84 - Every time I breathe in, I almost pass out from the pain.\\
85 - This is the single greatest thing\\
86 - that has ever happened to me.\\
87 - What? Well, for as long as I can remember,\\
88 - my mom has been torturing me with guilt.\\
89 - I've never been able to fight back, but this is perfect.\\
90 - Her first-born child almost dies a thousand miles from home,\\
91 - and she's the one who sent me here.\\
92 - She can't dismiss it, she can't argue about it,\\
93 - she can't twist it around and make it my fault.\\
94 - It's beautiful.\\
95 - Dude, you almost died.\\
96 - I want you to say that again when she gets here.\\
97 - Oh, this poor woman has no idea what she's walking into.\\
98 - Okay, Mom's only gonna be gone\\
99 - for about four or five days, so we have to prioritize.\\
100 - What are you asking Dad for?\\
101 - I want to wear my pajamas to school.\\
102 - I'm getting a scope for my BB gun.\\
103 - You don't have a BB gun.\\
104 - Not yet.\\
105 - Okay, but since I'm asking to build a killer robot,\\
106 - I should go first.\\
107 - Why?\\
108 - Because anything after "killer robot"\\
109 - is gonna sound reasonable.\\
110 - Dad?\\
111 - Yeah.\\
112 - A couple friends and I want to explore\\
113 - our engineering and machining skills.\\
114 - Sounds great.\\
115 - So, um, you think it'd be all right\\
116 - if a bunch of Krelboynes and I build a robot in the house?\\
117 - Yeah, fine.\\
118 - Whoa, that was easy, even for him.\\
119 - For crying out loud.\\
120 - Be strong.\\
121 - Lois will get through her operation.\\
122 - She is a fighter.\\
123 - No, no, Craig, it was Francis.\\
124 - Oh, my God.\\
125 - Did he shoot her?\\
126 - I knew it.\\
127 - I t-told her to stay away from him.\\
128 - That boy has been nothing but trouble.\\
129 - Uh, Craig, uh, Lois did not have an operation.\\
130 - Our son Francis did.\\
131 - Sh-She just went down to Alabama to look after him for a while.\\
132 - Oh.\\
133 - Well, tell Lois I stopped by.\\
134 - I can't believe my mom missed them putting my catheter in.\\
135 - Maybe I should take it out\\
136 - so they can reinsert it when she gets here.\\
137 - Or maybe you could,\\
138 - I don't know, shut up about your mom for half a second.\\
139 - No one's that bad.\\
140 - Hey, I been sugar-coating it for you 'cause you're enfeebled.\\
141 - Francis!\\
142 - But you can just see for yourself.\\
143 - Hi, honey.\\
144 - You look terrible.\\
145 - You think that's gonna appease your guilt?\\
146 - What guilt?\\
147 - Boy, it's stuffy in here.\\
148 - That can't be good for you.\\
149 - You look pasty.\\
150 - Have you had a bowel movement?\\
151 - When is the last time you moved your bowels? Mom...\\
152 - Hello.\\
153 - Who are you?\\
154 - Edwin Spangler-- I am commandant of Marlin Academy.\\
155 - Good for you.\\
156 - Where's your eye?\\
157 - Pardon?\\
158 - Do your ears work?\\
159 - Do you have some business with my son?\\
160 - He needs to rest.\\
161 - Well, I stopped by to pick up your boy's homework.\\
162 - Homework?! You're not giving him homework.\\
163 - My son nearly lost his life--\\
164 - something that never would've happened\\
165 - if you'd taken proper care of him in the first place.\\
166 - Well, I assure you, ma'am,\\
167 - had it not been for Francis's long history of crying wolf...\\
168 - Crying wolf?\\
169 - You listen to me, you idiot!\\
170 - My child is sick.\\
171 - He does not need you marching in here, puffing up\\
172 - your little chest and making his life\\
173 - more miserable than it already is.\\
174 - Why don't you just go play army man somewhere else?\\
175 - God, she is magnificent.\\
176 - Dude, your mom rocks.\\
177 - Hmm.\\
178 - You got a girl, Rizzo?\\
179 - Yeah, Sarge. I miss her something awful.\\
180 - Soon as I get home, I'm going to marry her.\\
181 - Rizzo!\\
182 - We need... more torque!\\
183 - No, we need a balance between speed and torque.\\
184 - This is great.\\
185 - I can make a huge mess, build a killer robot,\\
186 - and Mom's not here to yell at us.\\
187 - I don't even mind having Krelboynes in the house.\\
188 - Do we all want\\
189 - a direct, continuous linear relation\\
190 - between the rotary actuator\\
191 - and the robot's translational displacement,\\
192 - or am I just some kind of crazy dreamer?\\
193 - Well, what about my design for\\
194 - - the polycarbonate body? - It's a...\\
195 - butterfly.\\
196 - Correction-- killer butterfly.\\
197 - Beautiful yet deadly.\\
198 - The perfect killing machine.\\
199 - It's too unreliable.\\
200 - It's got to be more simple, like a sledgehammer or...\\
201 - A superheated spike shot out by power charges.\\
202 - Yeah, but that's not going to be easy...\\
203 - What's this stuff?\\
204 - We were just... sort of... fooling around with some ideas.\\
205 - Let's have a look.\\
206 - Well... I'd go with the flame thrower.\\
207 - That would destroy everything within a ten-foot perimeter.\\
208 - Of course, a lot to be said for that high-voltage probe.\\
209 - Sir, before you continue, I feel I have to mention\\
210 - that our parents strongly disapprove of this.\\
211 - Sorry. My therapist says it's a compulsion.\\
212 - Well, I guess you shouldn't tell your parents, then.\\
213 - Wow.\\
214 - Your father's lack of responsibility\\
215 - is both terrifying and...\\
216 - oddly thrilling.\\
217 - I can't apologize enough for these barbaric accommodations.\\
218 - You deserve so much more.\\
219 - Oh, no, this is fine.\\
220 - Why are all the hotel rooms booked?\\
221 - The all-Alabama gay rodeo is in town again.\\
222 - Homosexuals riding horses and such.\\
223 - It does wonders for the local economy,\\
224 - but you have to fight the crowds for everything.\\
225 - If you're interested, I have some passes.\\
226 - No, thanks. Another time, then.\\
227 - Bonsoir.\\
228 - You know, this room isn't so bad.\\
229 - The way you whined about it, I thought it was going to be\\
230 - a couple of cots and a drain in the floor.\\
231 - What are you doing? You're stinky.\\
232 - I'm going to give you a sponge bath.\\
233 - You're not giving me a sponge bath.\\
234 - Arms up.\\
235 - Just because you had surgery is no reason to be a pig.\\
236 - Mom, did you know that I almost died?\\
237 - Oh, you did not almost die.\\
238 - My appendix burst!\\
239 - They had to vacuum out the contents of my intestines.\\
240 - You could not possibly comprehend\\
241 - the pain that I was in-- that I am in.\\
242 - Yeah. I don't know anything about pain,\\
243 - what, with four boys totaling 112 hours of labor--\\
244 - you being half of that, I might add.\\
245 - I'm sorry that I came out feet first, Mom.\\
246 - That's okay, honey.\\
247 - I forgave you years ago.\\
248 - Oh, God, that tattoo.\\
249 - I like the tattoo, Mom.\\
250 - What is it with the men in this family and tattoos?\\
251 - Took me five years to get your father\\
252 - to burn his off.\\
253 - What, are you growing potatoes in there?\\
254 - Dad had a tattoo?\\
255 - Yeah, he put a great big "Lois"\\
256 - right across his rear end.\\
257 - Actually thought I'd be flattered by it.\\
258 - That guy was such a mess when I met him.\\
259 - Between the motorcycle\\
260 - and the drinking and the fighting--\\
261 - he was so reckless, it was crazy.\\
262 - Where do you think you boys get it from?\\
263 - Just doesn't sound like Dad.\\
264 - Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.\\
265 - Your father has been quite a project.\\
266 - I spent years hounding him and scolding him\\
267 - and constantly watching him,\\
268 - but finally\\
269 - I got all that rebellion right out of him.\\
270 - I can't believe Dad had a wild side.\\
271 - Well, someday, you're going to meet a nice girl.\\
272 - She's going to do the same thing for you.\\
273 - Do your lowers.\\
274 - Dad?\\
275 - Oh, hey, son.\\
276 - What are you doing? I just thought\\
277 - I'd help you kids out with your robot.\\
278 - You know, it's amazing how much you can get accomplished\\
279 - when you don't sleep at all.\\
280 - I think we got a little something up our sleeve\\
281 - for the competition.\\
282 - Dad...\\
283 - I know, it's still a little slow.\\
284 - But wait till I put on the big blade.\\
285 - I eat your heart and thus avenge my father.\\
286 - Well, we just finished the 45th and final video\\
287 - of the Shaolin Dragon series.\\
288 - We are now officially desensitized to violence.\\
289 - How many sodas have you had?\\
290 - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.\\
291 - Look, I can write on my tongue.\\
292 - Well, we can start in on Monks of Death\\
293 - or lighten things up with a little Samurai Bloodfest.\\
294 - We've had a vote.\\
295 - We're backing out of the contest.\\
296 - What?\\
297 - Your father has commandeered this project\\
298 - and twisted it toward his own mad ends.\\
299 - We want our blueprints back.\\
300 - We can... do this...\\
301 - the easy... way...\\
302 - or... we can...\\
303 - do this... the hard...\\
304 - Come on, my dad's in the backyard.\\
305 - ...way.\\
306 - Dad?\\
307 - Hey, boys.\\
308 - Guys want the...\\
309 - Are you smoking?\\
310 - Oh, this? No, I'm just...\\
311 - just playing around.\\
312 - Listen, don't tell your mom, okay?\\
313 - She'd kill me if she found out.\\
314 - She worked so hard to get me to stop.\\
315 - Oh, God, how I miss that woman.\\
316 - Um, the guys want their blueprints back.\\
317 - Oh, yeah, they're over there.\\
318 - I have gone way past that.\\
319 - Hey, picture this.\\
320 - A laser-guided bee cannon.\\
321 - Bees shot out with the precision of a laser.\\
322 - How would that hurt a robot?\\
323 - Oh, come on, think.\\
324 - It's not for the robot,\\
325 - it's for the guy controlling the robot.\\
326 - Buzz, zap!\\
327 - You're going home\\
328 - with the plaque or ribbon\\
329 - or whatever crappy award they give you for winning.\\
330 - This...\\
331 - will end... badly.\\
332 - There we go.\\
333 - I hear you, old fella!\\
334 - You're not alone.\\
335 - Come on, come on, do it for mama!\\
336 - Come on, come on, go!\\
337 - Aw, come on. You're just letting me win, aren't you?\\
338 - I'm really not.\\
339 - I know. I'm just rubbing it in.\\
340 - Rubbing it in!\\
341 - Your mom is great.\\
342 - This isn't my mom.\\
343 - It's an act.\\
344 - It's some kind of freaky mind game she's playing with me.\\
345 - Any second now, her face is going to split open\\
346 - and she's going to reveal herself\\
347 - for the evil banshee she really is.\\
348 - Man, I don't know why she puts up with you.\\
349 - Anyone for doubles?\\
350 - Nope.\\
351 - All right, then.\\
352 - Oh, hi, honey. Where you been?\\
353 - I want you to leave.\\
354 - What?\\
355 - I want you to leave.\\
356 - You made your phony point.\\
357 - You made me look like an idiot.\\
358 - Mission accomplished. Okay.\\
359 - You know what? I have had it with you, mister.\\
360 - You have done nothing but bitch and moan since I got here,\\
361 - and I've been nothing but pleasant. Exactly!\\
362 - Oh, what, you complain when I'm pleasant,\\
363 - you complain when I'm not pleasant?\\
364 - There's no winning with you.\\
365 - Why don't you just tell me\\
366 - exactly how you want me to behave\\
367 - every second of the day, and we'll see if that satisfies you.\\
368 - This isn't fair! You're taking my pain\\
369 - and you're twisting it into your guilt trip!\\
370 - Fine. Why don't I just leave, then?\\
371 - Fine. Fine.\\
372 - Mom being gone was fun at first,\\
373 - but this is getting out of control.\\
374 - Please be Mom.\\
375 - Please be Mom. Please be Mom.\\
376 - Hello? Hello!\\
377 - Oh. Hi, Mr. Jackson.\\
378 - Well, yes,\\
379 - I do have a very good reason\\
380 - for not going in to work today.\\
381 - Well, how about this?\\
382 - I didn't come to work because\\
383 - somehow I felt that eight hours of joyless, mind-numbing crap\\
384 - just didn't seem like fun.\\
385 - Well, I guess we're just going to have to agree to disagree.\\
386 - Yeah!\\
387 - I thought your flight wasn't till 11:00.\\
388 - It isn't.\\
389 - So we have some extra time.\\
390 - You want to... do something?\\
391 - We're in the middle of Alabama.\\
392 - What is there to do?\\
393 - Gay rodeo's in town.\\
394 - That could be interesting.\\
395 - Well, if that's what you want to do.\\
396 - Look, it isn't really what I want to do.\\
397 - I'm trying to be pleasant...\\
398 - We'll go.\\
399 - Please be Mom.\\
400 - Craig.\\
401 - Just brought by your mom's paycheck.\\
402 - Tell her I'm the one that brought it by.\\
403 - Wait. We need your help.\\
404 - My dad's going crazy. He hasn't slept in four days.\\
405 - He's smoking, he's dancing around in his underwear.\\
406 - He's ripping phones out of the walls.\\
407 - You've got to stop him.\\
408 - Don't worry, son.\\
409 - I'll handle this.\\
410 - What are you doing?\\
411 - You don't expect me to tackle\\
412 - something like this on an empty stomach.\\
413 - Hey, buddy.\\
414 - Well, well.\\
415 - What do we have here?\\
416 - The boy here says you could use some company.\\
417 - No, I got my sons. We're bonding.\\
418 - What the hell is that thing?\\
419 - That thing is a little project\\
420 - we have been working on around here.\\
421 - A secret, deadly project.\\
422 - Hal...\\
423 - why don't you turn off the machine and sit down?\\
424 - Why don't you stop telling me what to do?\\
425 - Why don't you sit down like I asked you to?\\
426 - Look, Fats...\\
427 - I don't want you around my house anymore.\\
428 - Hey, you don't go to the fat thing,\\
429 - I won't go to the crazy thing.\\
430 - Dad, cut it out! Come on, it's not funny anymore!\\
431 - Leave him alone!\\
432 - Say "uncle"! No!\\
433 - Just say it.\\
434 - We can stop this right now\\
435 - with a little dignity if you just say it!\\
436 - I won't say it!\\
437 - One simple word.\\
438 - Duncle.\\
439 - Uh-uh, you said "duncle."\\
440 - Now you have to say "uncle" in my butt.\\
441 - No! Let me up!\\
442 - Dad, you have to stop it! Dad, no!\\
443 - You're right.\\
444 - I've got better things to do.\\
445 - Dad, what are you doing?\\
446 - I think me and Lois Number Two here\\
447 - are going to go down to work\\
448 - and pay a little visit to Mr. Jackson's Lexus.\\
449 - Hey!\\
450 - Dad, don't move.\\
451 - W-What are you doing?\\
452 - I'm stopping you from quitting your job\\
453 - by threatening you with a killer robot.\\
454 - I wish this felt half as cool as it sounds.\\
455 - Just turn it off, Malcolm.\\
456 - Stop being crazy.\\
457 - Just put the remote down.\\
458 - You-you have no idea what this machine is capable of.\\
459 - Why don't you just sit down?\\
460 - And why don't you just put the remote down?\\
461 - Dad, please.\\
462 - Malcolm...\\
463 - Why don't you both just shut up?!\\
464 - Run. No kidding. Run.\\
465 - Oh, no.\\
466 - Call... animal... control.\\
467 - You ripped the phone out of the wall.\\
468 - Go... to... the neighbor.\\
469 - They won't let us over anymore.\\
470 - Do... something.\\
471 - Why don't we just all sit down\\
472 - and no one will do anything until Mom gets home?\\
473 - Okay.\\
474 - I got to say, as far as gay rodeos go,\\
475 - this one's pretty entertaining.\\
476 - Are you sure you're not embarrassed\\
477 - to be seen with your mother?\\
478 - Nah.
\subsection {Episode 15: Smunday}
1 - I picked this trick up in camp last year.\\
2 - This is gonna be great.\\
3 - Wait for it.\\
4 - Wait for it...\\
5 - Oh, screw it.\\
6 - Oh, man.\\
7 - What's wrong, Reese?\\
8 - Nothing! Just-just shut up\\
9 - and go to sleep, okay?\\
10 - It's good to be alive.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - Hey, Dewey, wake up!\\
24 - It's Monday morning. Hooray!\\
25 - I never thought I'd be happy about a Monday,\\
26 - but today's the end of two months of being grounded.\\
27 - Two months!\\
28 - What are you doing?\\
29 - Shut up! I have to finish my history homework.\\
30 - Reese, we couldn't do anything all weekend.\\
31 - No friends,\\
32 - no TV; we did absolutely nothing.\\
33 - And you still managed not to do your homework?\\
34 - Hey, the point is, we never should've\\
35 - been grounded in the first place.\\
36 - He is right.\\
37 - Mom went way overboard.\\
38 - We didn't even do anything that bad.\\
39 - Okay, so if we give you Dewey's bike,\\
40 - Circus will eat a wet dog food sandwich.\\
41 - Right.\\
42 - Sounds good. Okay then.\\
43 - Wait a minute.\\
44 - I don't want you ripping off my little brothers.\\
45 - You only get the bike if he eats the whole can.\\
46 - Done.\\
47 - You the man, Circus.\\
48 - You the man.\\
49 - This is worth it.\\
50 - What you gonna tell Mom?\\
51 - The guy pushed him off...\\
52 - took the bike...\\
53 - and then just ran off.\\
54 - How'd she know we were lying?\\
55 - We were brilliant.\\
56 - How's Mom?\\
57 - Oh, she's got a temperature of 104.\\
58 - I've never seen her this sick.\\
59 - It's like some sort of horrible science experiment in there.\\
60 - Mom's been sick with the flu all weekend.\\
61 - I'd feel more sympathetic, but two months with no TV\\
62 - has killed the part of me that cares.\\
63 - I finally figured out\\
64 - how Mom could tell we were lying.\\
65 - How?\\
66 - Pheromones.\\
67 - She can smell the fear on us.\\
68 - Next time you lie,\\
69 - you have to take a shower first.\\
70 - Okay, boys,\\
71 - look, I got to go to work, but before I do,\\
72 - I want to talk to you for a minute.\\
73 - Now, when I get home,\\
74 - I get to plug this cord back into the TV.\\
75 - So you boys have to behave.\\
76 - You're not the only ones who've suffered with no TV.\\
77 - For all I know, there's a new wrestling champion.\\
78 - So... I want you to get to school on time.\\
79 - And before you leave, you go in there,\\
80 - and tell your mother to feel better.\\
81 - Maybe we should just let her sleep.\\
82 - She slept straight through the last 48 hours.\\
83 - I think it's okay to wake her up for five minutes.\\
84 - Mom?\\
85 - You're starting to look better.\\
86 - He's not lying.\\
87 - Mom kills most germs on contact,\\
88 - but when one does get through, it's a doozy.\\
89 - You kids remember\\
90 - you're not stepping foot out of this house today.\\
91 - Huh? No TV.\\
92 - No friends... till tomorrow.\\
93 - But, Mom... This is the last Sunday\\
94 - of your punishment.\\
95 - But...\\
96 - Okay, Mom, we got it. We're still grounded.\\
97 - What are you doing?\\
98 - Mom slept all weekend.\\
99 - She still thinks it's Sunday.\\
100 - You know what this means?\\
101 - No.\\
102 - We can pretend today's Sunday\\
103 - and stay home from school.\\
104 - Oh, I'm in.\\
105 - Okay, Mom.\\
106 - We're just going to go continue our punishment.\\
107 - And we're definitely not going to school.\\
108 - Shut up.\\
109 -        \\
110 - Beautiful, huh?\\
111 - Huh?! Just came in this week.\\
112 - Just looking. I'm just...\\
113 - Please, take your time, take your time.\\
114 - Enjoy yourself.\\
115 - Wow.\\
116 - I love this car. Yeah.\\
117 - Oh, I see you've added four ponies from last year.\\
118 - We also put in the new skid control system.\\
119 - Oh? Hey, you know,\\
120 - the new brochures just came in.\\
121 - I could show you one if you want.\\
122 - No, I-I-I should get to work.\\
123 - Sir, can I ask,\\
124 - is your job really so important\\
125 - that you can't allow yourself five minutes of pleasure?\\
126 - I have no response to that.\\
127 - Yes! All right!\\
128 - All right, this'll be great!\\
129 - Yes!\\
130 - No, wait, we can't. Someone will see us.\\
131 - We're supposed to be in school.\\
132 - Okay.\\
133 - We'll just stay inside and watch T...\\
134 - Oh, dang!\\
135 - Just give me some time to think.\\
136 - Come on, already, think of something!\\
137 - I'm trying.\\
138 - All I've got are all the reasons\\
139 - this was a stupid idea in the first place.\\
140 - Even if we manage to keep Mom fooled,\\
141 - we're screwed as soon as Dad gets home.\\
142 - It basically means we're gonna sit here\\
143 - bored out of our minds for eight hours\\
144 - and wait for Mom to top our last punishment.\\
145 - How could you be so stupid?\\
146 - I could've done that myself.\\
147 - Get it before Mom wakes up!\\
148 - - Hello. - Look, Mom.\\
149 - It's all a pack of lies! I had nothing to do with it!\\
150 - Seriously, I was nowhere near that place... Francis?\\
151 - It's Francis? Let me talk. Oh! Oh!\\
152 - Come on, let me talk! Please?\\
153 - What are you guys doing home?\\
154 - Mom's sick.\\
155 - She thinks it's Sunday.\\
156 - We kind of went with it.\\
157 - Cool.\\
158 - Oh, dude, I need you to do me a giant favor.\\
159 - Go check the mail.\\
160 - Okay, there should be a letter there\\
161 - from Southern Alabama State.\\
162 - Yeah, it's here.\\
163 - Why, did you apply there? No.\\
164 - There's probably no point in me ever trying to.\\
165 - I kind of drove a backhoe into their swimming pool.\\
166 - Oh, man. Did they have to drain the pool?\\
167 - No, if you put a ten-foot crack in them,\\
168 - they pretty much drain themselves.\\
169 - They did have to drain the gym, though.\\
170 - Ooh. But I have a plan.\\
171 - I want you to take the letter\\
172 - and hide it.\\
173 - Okay, and then what?\\
174 - And then hopefully...\\
175 - I'll come up with a good idea later.\\
176 - That's all I got so far.\\
177 - Yeah, we're kind of in the same boat.\\
178 - We're stuck in the house with nothing to do.\\
179 - You guys should go down to the arcade on Hillcrest.\\
180 - The manager there has a pretty enlightened outlook\\
181 - about a kid's right to choose his own school hours.\\
182 - We don't have any money, though.\\
183 - All right, you guys are doing me a favor,\\
184 - so I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.\\
185 - Mom keeps some money\\
186 - in the top left drawer of her dresser,\\
187 - but she won't notice\\
188 - if you only take between five and seven dollars.\\
189 - What are you boys doing?\\
190 - Looking for our money.\\
191 - It's not there.\\
192 - I moved it to the back of the closet.\\
193 - Where she hides her Christmas presents?\\
194 - No...\\
195 - I moved those to the attic.\\
196 - Um, Mom, where'd you hide that football\\
197 - I broke the window with?\\
198 - In the garage.\\
199 - And when you made chipped beef on toast last week,\\
200 - was that really beef?\\
201 - Who knows?\\
202 - It was 39 cents a pound.\\
203 - Did Grandpa really punch Jimmy Carter in the face?\\
204 - No, he just threw a rock at the motorcade and ran off.\\
205 - Did you really give my red blanket to the poor kids?\\
206 - No, your father used it to clean the barbecue.\\
207 - I was really adopted, wasn't I?\\
208 - Oh, you're ours... and we love you.\\
209 - Damn.\\
210 - So, um...\\
211 - I don't know.\\
212 - What's your favorite color?\\
213 - For the third time, green.\\
214 - Let's just go.\\
215 - Wait.\\
216 - I got a good one.\\
217 - How'd you know Dewey's bike wasn't really stolen?\\
218 - That is a good one.\\
219 - Francis told me.\\
220 - I can't believe it! Francis ratted on us to Mom!\\
221 - No!\\
222 - He wouldn't do that. You did it!\\
223 - Shut up! He sold us out!\\
224 - Francis is dead to us now!\\
225 - Wait a minute--\\
226 - that makes me the oldest brother.\\
227 - Guys, seriously--\\
228 - if you have any problems, you can come to me.\\
229 - Dewey, get me some ice tea.\\
230 - No!\\
231 - We should just give this to Mom and let him fry.\\
232 - Right.\\
233 - No, wait!\\
234 - It's Francis.\\
235 - We can't just take Mom's word for it.\\
236 - Hey, Malcolm, everything okay?\\
237 - Um, Francis...\\
238 - we were just wondering...\\
239 - Mom said...\\
240 - you ratted on us about Dewey's bike.\\
241 - But she's probably just mixed up, right?\\
242 - Because you're our big brother and you wouldn't do\\
243 - something like that-- Francis?\\
244 - You don't know\\
245 - what kind of pressure I was under!\\
246 - You butt-wipe!\\
247 - How could you?\\
248 - Well, did he do it?\\
249 - I can't believe you!\\
250 - You're our big brother!\\
251 - You're supposed to protect us, not betray us.\\
252 - He did it, didn't he?\\
253 - Malcolm, just let me explain... And then you actually\\
254 - have the nerve to ask us to risk our butts for you?\\
255 - Maybe we should just give the letter to Mom.\\
256 - No, you can't do that! Yeah, why not?\\
257 - Because if you give the letter to Mom,\\
258 - she'll know it's not Sunday.\\
259 - I'll just tell her it came special delivery.\\
260 - Yeah, well, she won't believe it\\
261 - 'cause she would have to sign for it.\\
262 - I could forge her signature.\\
263 - But then she'll know you can forge her signature.\\
264 - Which won't matter at all\\
265 - because she'll be so mad at you,\\
266 - she won't even think about me for a few days.\\
267 - And even if she does, I'll just tell her\\
268 - I didn't want to disturb her.\\
269 - So in addition to you getting nailed,\\
270 - I'll get points for being sympathetic.\\
271 - Put Reese on the phone.\\
272 - You know, Hal, owning a Porsche\\
273 - is not just for the wealthy anymore.\\
274 - My lifemate and I, we both drive 'em.\\
275 - Really?\\
276 - Oh, she's a very lucky lady.\\
277 - Oh. A blond.\\
278 - This is going to sound clich  d, Hal,\\
279 - but what can I do to put you in that car today?\\
280 - You can give me $90,000.\\
281 - That's funny.\\
282 - Yeah. Seriously, we have\\
283 - all kinds of financial plans available.\\
284 - Why don't we take it for a test drive?\\
285 - Nah, I... I don't know.\\
286 - I would have to call work and...\\
287 - There's a phone...\\
288 - in the car.\\
289 - So, do we give Mom the letter now\\
290 - or wait till Dad gets home and give him both barrels?\\
291 - Now!\\
292 - Do it now!\\
293 - We're not giving Mom the letter.\\
294 - Of course we are!\\
295 - We have to!\\
296 - He's a traitor!\\
297 - He has to pay!\\
298 - He must suffer!\\
299 - We can't give Mom the letter. She'd kill him.\\
300 - But we can make him think we're giving her the letter.\\
301 - We could make him think\\
302 - we're scuzzy, dirty backstabbers\\
303 - just like he is.\\
304 - Oh, okay.\\
305 - Hello. Hey, it's me.\\
306 - Well, if it isn't the snitch.\\
307 - Hi, snitch.\\
308 - Come on, Malcolm.\\
309 - Let's just end this before it gets out of control.\\
310 - I know how you guys feel.\\
311 - You do, huh? How do we feel?\\
312 - Well... bad.\\
313 - No.\\
314 - The words that come to my mind\\
315 - are revenge, payback, envelope.\\
316 - Malcolm, you're not going to give Mom the letter.\\
317 - I don't think you're in any position to call the shots.\\
318 - No, but... Richie should be right about now.\\
319 - Richie? Yeah?\\
320 - That was the best 12 minutes of my life.\\
321 - Well, I'm glad to hear that, Hal.\\
322 - You know, there are a couple of people\\
323 - I'd like you to meet.\\
324 - Okay, listen up:\\
325 - my mom's in her bedroom, so you gotta keep it down,\\
326 - and remember, don't hurt my brothers.\\
327 - Circus!\\
328 - It's okay. It was ugly.\\
329 - Man, just get the letter\\
330 - and don't let Malcolm out of your sight.\\
331 - He's too smart.\\
332 - Uh-oh.\\
333 - What do you mean, "uh-oh"? What did he do?\\
334 - He's out of breath.\\
335 - Damn it! He hid the letter.\\
336 - Okay, kid, you've got\\
337 - three seconds to tell me\\
338 - or I'm going to pound you within an...\\
339 - Richie!\\
340 - Which part of "no hurting my brothers"\\
341 - didn't you understand?\\
342 - I got to tell you, man,\\
343 - you're not allowing me\\
344 - a single creative thought here.\\
345 - Where'd you put it?\\
346 - In the VCR. I know.\\
347 - If we set fire to the house,\\
348 - Malcolm will go right for the letter.\\
349 - Why would he go right for the letter?\\
350 - Well, maybe we should just set fire to the house and find out.\\
351 - Put Justin on the phone.\\
352 - You the man, Francis.\\
353 - You the man!\\
354 - Put Richie back on the phone.\\
355 - Hey, you can tear up the house if you want\\
356 - with my mom here and explain it to her\\
357 - or you can quit and slink away\\
358 - like the monosyllabic mouth-breathers you are.\\
359 - What'd he say?\\
360 - He said a lot of things,\\
361 - but the gist of it is, we got to tear up the house.\\
362 - No, you can't do that. Just...\\
363 - wait a minute, I have an idea.\\
364 - Look at Reese.\\
365 - What's he doing?\\
366 - He's just sitting there.\\
367 - No, look at his eyes. What are his eyes doing?\\
368 - They're looking back at me.\\
369 - Okay, just keep looking at him.\\
370 - He's looking at the VCR.\\
371 - No, I-I was looking at the... the other thing.\\
372 - Bingo! We got it!\\
373 - You're the man, Richie!\\
374 - All right!\\
375 - Who wants a latte?\\
376 - I'm really sorry, you guys.\\
377 - For what?\\
378 - You were perfect.\\
379 - You did exactly what I thought you'd do.\\
380 - What are you talking about?\\
381 - They have a fake letter.\\
382 - I knew Francis wouldn't leave us alone\\
383 - without getting something\\
384 - and I knew you'd give it away.\\
385 - I knew exactly what everyone would do.\\
386 - So where's the real letter?\\
387 - I had to think of the one place\\
388 - they'd never think of looking.\\
389 - I had to give it to the one person\\
390 - they'd never think\\
391 - I'd give it to.\\
392 - I did the most brilliant thing of all:\\
393 - I gave it to Dewey.\\
394 - And I hid it under Mom's pillow.\\
395 - You what?!\\
396 - I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him.\\
397 - I am going to kill him!\\
398 - This is all a dream.\\
399 - Oh, shut up, Reese!\\
400 - Mom, stop it.\\
401 - You're sick.\\
402 - I'm too mad to be sick.\\
403 - No, he has finally done it this time.\\
404 - Where is that brochure\\
405 - for the work farm in Arizona?\\
406 - He thinks military school is tough?\\
407 - Just wait.\\
408 - Wait.\\
409 - Wait...\\
410 - wait...\\
411 - wait!\\
412 - Hey, Malcolm?\\
413 - Hi, Francis.\\
414 - Look, I'm sorry about all this.\\
415 - I shouldn't have\\
416 - sent those guys over.\\
417 - It was stupid.\\
418 - You know, Francis,\\
419 - we never actually intended to show the letter to Mom.\\
420 - We just wanted to scare you.\\
421 - Yeah, I know.\\
422 - You guys would never do that to me.\\
423 - But if she did see the letter,\\
424 - you'd know it was just an accident, right?\\
425 - Yeah, but Richie has the letter.\\
426 - Please tell me Richie has the letter.\\
427 - Richie has coupons.\\
428 - Mom has the letter.\\
429 - But like I said, it was just an accident. I swear.\\
430 - So the thing you've been threatening to do all day\\
431 - but had no intention of doing, you did but didn't mean to?\\
432 - Yeah.\\
433 - You can yell at us now.\\
434 - No, I guess I deserve it.\\
435 - I shouldn't have ratted on you guys.\\
436 - Mom was just really pressuring me about coming home\\
437 - and, well, I folded.\\
438 - Coming home?\\
439 - Yeah, she said if I wanted to come home for the summer,\\
440 - I had to tell her about the bike.\\
441 - But that's just a lame excuse.\\
442 - I'm sorry.\\
443 - Actually, that was a pretty good excuse.\\
444 - Wow, you have made a great deal here, Hal.\\
445 - Now, you just, uh, sign right there\\
446 - and she's all yours.\\
447 - Yeah, you know, I-I've been thinking...\\
448 - I think maybe I got a little overexcited.\\
449 - Aw, that's just the jitters.\\
450 - They'll be long gone when you're roaring home\\
451 - in your brand-new Porsche.\\
452 - Just sign. No, I think\\
453 - maybe we should do this another time\\
454 - because I-I'm not feeling very well\\
455 - and my wife has the flu...\\
456 - I'll tell you what--\\
457 - let's throw in the new chrome turbo wheels\\
458 - and free car washes for a year-- just sign.\\
459 - I can't.\\
460 - But, Hal...\\
461 - you put your initials by this number.\\
462 - Sorry.\\
463 - Maybe some other time.\\
464 - Hal, will you do me one favor?\\
465 - One favor, now, I want you just to...\\
466 - stick your head in the car one last time, okay?\\
467 - I want you to smell the leather,\\
468 - take another look at that console,\\
469 - and tell me you don't want this car.\\
470 - Go ahead, do it.\\
471 - Come on.\\
472 - So what do you say?\\
473 - I told you I was sick!\\
474 - Oh, my God!\\
475 - You guys,\\
476 - we can save Francis.\\
477 - What?! Think about it--\\
478 - every time Mom gets mad,\\
479 - she forgets about everything else in the world\\
480 - except for the things she's mad at.\\
481 - That focus is the key to her power.\\
482 - So?\\
483 - So Mom won't care so much\\
484 - about sending Francis to a work farm\\
485 - if she's busy being mad at someone else, like at us.\\
486 - We can do that.\\
487 - Yeah. You don't understand.\\
488 - We're going to have to get in real trouble,\\
489 - more trouble than we've ever been in, in our entire lives.\\
490 - And we can't make it look like we're doing it on purpose.\\
491 - I just want you guys to know what you're in for.\\
492 - We owe it to him.\\
493 - Okay, we got Dad's skating trophy,\\
494 - Mom and Dad's wedding portrait,\\
495 - Mom's favorite lamp.\\
496 - No, Dewey, it's stuff they like, not you.\\
497 - Oh.\\
498 - Good!\\
499 - Paint?!\\
500 - Yeah.\\
501 - That way, we not only destroy the stuff;\\
502 - we take out the driveway,\\
503 - splash on the house and, with any luck,\\
504 - get some collateral damage\\
505 - to the neighbors.\\
506 - What a waste!\\
507 - For any other reason\\
508 - this would've been the funnest thing ever.\\
509 - Okay, guys...\\
510 - have the last candy bars of your childhood.\\
511 - Hey! Time to wake up!\\
512 - Hey! Time to wake up!\\
513 - Hey! Time to wake up! Hey! Time to wake up!\\
514 - Hey! Time to wake up!\\
515 - Hey! Time to wake up! Hey! Time to wake up!\\
516 - Hey! Time to wake up! Hey...\\
517 - Okay, here she comes.\\
518 - Now, remember, this is supposed to be fun.\\
519 -     Down, down, down you go    \\
520 -     No way to stop    \\
521 -     As you fall, hear me call    \\
522 -     "No, no, no"    \\
523 -     Fogging the view, cupping face to the window    \\
524 -     In darkness you make out a spiraling shape    \\
525 -     Putting all reason aside, you exchange what you got    \\
526 -     For a thing that's hypnotic and strange    \\
527 -     The spiraling shape will make you go insane.    \\
528 - Well, I guess it's mission accomplished.\\
529 - I don't think Mom even remembers she has a son named Francis.\\
530 - Boys!\\
531 - Just come down.\\
532 - We're not coming down until you tell us what you're going to do.\\
533 - Not going to tell you what I'm going to do until you come down.\\
534 - Why don't you just tell us?\\
535 - Why don't you just come down?\\
536 - Tell us. Come down.\\
537 - Just tell us! Come down.\\
538 - But if you tell us, we'll come down.
\subsection {Episode 16: Water Park}
1 - Who wants to make five bucks?\\
2 - How? How?\\
3 - I need someone\\
4 - to take the fall.\\
5 - - Oh, my God! - What did you do?\\
6 - I can't tell you.\\
7 - Yes or no, no questions asked.\\
8 - Oh, my God!\\
9 - Make it ten.\\
10 - Done.\\
11 - Oh, my God!\\
12 - You're a good son. I got him, honey!\\
13 - I got him! Don't worry.\\
14 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
15 -     I don't know    \\
16 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - There you go-- all pink and shiny.\\
27 - Mmm. Boys?\\
28 - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\\
29 - Ooh! Feel ten pounds lighter.\\
30 - You ready?\\
31 - Oh, yeah. Go.\\
32 - Uh, aah...\\
33 - Dad got us free tickets\\
34 - to the water slide park from work.\\
35 - It takes two days to prep him,\\
36 - but it's worth it.\\
37 - Ooh, smooth as a seal.\\
38 - Ready for that water slide.\\
39 - You know, we haven't been on an outing in a long time.\\
40 - It's nice when we can do things together as a family.\\
41 - Do what together?\\
42 - Why can't I go?\\
43 - Dewey, we discussed this.\\
44 - You have to stay home because of your ear infection.\\
45 - I never get to go.\\
46 - Honey, I know it seems like a pattern,\\
47 - but it's just this.\\
48 - And Disneyland.\\
49 - Oh, and that chocolate factory tour.\\
50 - You know, maybe it's time you stopped\\
51 - sticking dirty things in your ears.\\
52 - Hey, Dewey.\\
53 - How's the ear?\\
54 - Stop teasing him, Reese!\\
55 - You know, if your father doesn't find a babysitter,\\
56 - nobody's going anywhere and we'll just see who's crying then!\\
57 - Oh, no, no, no. It's just the little one.\\
58 - Yeah, the other two aren't going to be anywhere near you.\\
59 - Ever since I can remember,\\
60 - we've always had trouble with babysitters.\\
61 - Hello!\\
62 - Goochy, goochy, goochy, goo.\\
63 - Goochy, goochy...\\
64 - I don't know, sweetie.\\
65 - What do you have behind your back?\\
66 - You little losers!\\
67 - I've had enough of this.\\
68 - You open this door right now.\\
69 - Okay, look. I'm a little claustrophobic, okay?\\
70 - Just open the door! Just let me out!\\
71 - Come on!\\
72 - I don't know.\\
73 - I'm starting to think it might be us.\\
74 - Well, you'd think I'd get bored\\
75 - wiping the floor with my cadets.\\
76 - God knows we enjoy it, sir.\\
77 - Do you know what your problem is, cadet?\\
78 - Discipline.\\
79 - Anything worth doing is worth doing well.\\
80 - Whatever I do, whether it's teaching you boys\\
81 - or mastering tai chi, or playing pool...\\
82 - I focus.\\
83 - I push myself.\\
84 - But you don't commit to anything, son.\\
85 - You're never going to be a winner\\
86 - because you do everything half-assed.\\
87 - Oh, regrettable.\\
88 - You may have spoken too soon, sir.\\
89 - I think you'll find I play pool with my whole ass.\\
90 - Eight ball, corner pocket.\\
91 - Damn.\\
92 - Ah, the fatal scratch.\\
93 - Once again, I waltz with Lady Victory.\\
94 - And until you focus, Francis,\\
95 - she is never going to be your dance partner.\\
96 - Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.\\
97 - And it was so nice of your agency\\
98 - to give us a second chance.\\
99 - You two are going to have so much fun together.\\
100 - Don't you dare hurt her.\\
101 - Hurry, the sun's coming up!\\
102 - Do you want to play something?\\
103 - No.\\
104 - Hey, hey, look, kids.\\
105 - Only 12 more miles to Wavetown, USA. Yay.\\
106 - So, Malcolm, you going to go down the Liquidator this time?\\
107 - Don't pressure the boy, Hal.\\
108 - I'm not pressuring him. I'm just asking.\\
109 - He's scared enough as it is\\
110 - without you making a big deal out of it.\\
111 - Hey, Mom, doesn't Malcolm have to wear\\
112 - his nose plug for his sinuses? Shut up.\\
113 - Oh, that's right. I forgot it.\\
114 - Listen, honey, you just be very careful then, okay?\\
115 - Don't worry, here it is.\\
116 - Oh. Thank you, Reese.\\
117 - Oh, my gosh, look at this!\\
118 - This is awesome!\\
119 - I can't wait to get on the rides.\\
120 - Malcolm, don't think you can take off\\
121 - that nose plug just because I'm not looking.\\
122 - You're going to wear it all day.\\
123 - But I'm not even in the water.\\
124 - Hey. If I catch you, for even one second,\\
125 - not wearing that nose plug,\\
126 - you're going to spend the day\\
127 - in the kiddie sprinkler.\\
128 - So what do you want to do first?\\
129 - What makes you think I want to do anything with you?\\
130 - What's your problem?\\
131 - That nose plug thing was bogus.\\
132 - You crossed the line, Reese.\\
133 - What?!\\
134 - You sold me out to Mom.\\
135 - It would've been different\\
136 - if I had done something to you, but...\\
137 - that was totally cold-blooded.\\
138 - Don't be such a baby.\\
139 - What you did to me was an act of war.\\
140 - And believe me, I will get you back.\\
141 - You won't know where or when, but you're gonna pay.\\
142 - You sound funny.\\
143 - You...\\
144 - you wanted to see me, sir?\\
145 - I just got a call from the sheriff\\
146 - that a cocksure, smart-mouthed youth\\
147 - looking very much like yourself\\
148 - has been hustling pool at the local bars.\\
149 - Really, sir?\\
150 - You are in serious trouble, cadet.\\
151 - I can explain...\\
152 - Why have you been holding back\\
153 - when we've played pool?\\
154 - What?\\
155 - I want to know why you've been letting me win.\\
156 - Sir, if I played for real\\
157 - I'd just end up humiliating you\\
158 - in front of the whole school, and...\\
159 - and you'd, you know, torture us all for it.\\
160 - Really, nothing good could come from it, and\\
161 - and, besides, winning seems to make you so happy.\\
162 - I am not a child.\\
163 - Do you really think me\\
164 - so petty that I would throw a tantrum\\
165 - over something so small as a game of pool?!\\
166 - My mistake, sir.\\
167 - We are going to play again.\\
168 - And you are going to give me\\
169 - your best game, cadet.\\
170 - And to make sure of that, if you don't win...\\
171 - picture yourself, 0400, awakened from sweet dreams of Mommy,\\
172 - sent outside into the bitter cold\\
173 - to raise our school colors\\
174 - and stand at attention for three hours\\
175 - until reveille is called.\\
176 - Now, picture that\\
177 - for 230 consecutive days.\\
178 - But what if I try my best and I still lose?\\
179 - Then you shall be miserable indeed.\\
180 - Dismissed.\\
181 - Remember, honey, how I promised you\\
182 - that exotic island vacation,\\
183 - but we had to go have children instead?\\
184 - Mm-hmm.\\
185 - Well, I was thinking\\
186 - maybe today could be our little island getaway.\\
187 - We've got the sun, the sand, the palm trees.\\
188 - And I brought the cocktails.\\
189 - It's Malibu rum in a lotion bottle\\
190 - so no one will know the difference.\\
191 - You are so cute when you sneak in alcohol.\\
192 - Hey, Reese, I think I just saw that girl you liked.\\
193 - You know, the one with the really long blonde hair.\\
194 - April? April, that's her.\\
195 - Why'd you say you liked her again?\\
196 - She's real trampy.\\
197 - I hear she kisses with tongue.\\
198 - Is that true, April?\\
199 - Jerk!\\
200 - Now we're even.\\
201 - You geek, you deserved it!\\
202 - Ow!\\
203 - Get out of here!\\
204 - I think those are ours.\\
205 - All right. No. I'll take care of it.\\
206 - Ow!\\
207 - Malcolm, Reese, knock it off!\\
208 - Can I watch TV?\\
209 - No.\\
210 - Can I play video games?\\
211 - No.\\
212 - What can I do?\\
213 - Something quiet.\\
214 - Quieter.\\
215 - I can do this.\\
216 - Keep your arms and legs crossed at all times.\\
217 - Do not bend your legs.\\
218 - Do not raise your head.\\
219 - Remove all piercings.\\
220 - You may have nothing around your neck.\\
221 - Enjoy the ride.\\
222 - Okay, here it goes.\\
223 - On three.\\
224 - One...\\
225 - two...\\
226 - three...!\\
227 - Hey, there, girlie.\\
228 - Let me adjust your bra strap.\\
229 - Now we're even.\\
230 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
231 - First, we sort by the number of holes,\\
232 - then by color.\\
233 - What's in your mouth?\\
234 - Nothing.\\
235 - There are at least 20 things I will not tolerate,\\
236 - and lying is one of them.\\
237 - Spit it out.\\
238 - You're eating my buttons.\\
239 - I wasn't eating. I was saving.\\
240 - What are you? A hamster?\\
241 - What were you saving it for?\\
242 - I don't know.\\
243 - It's pretty. It's my favorite one.\\
244 - You know... actually, it's my favorite, too.\\
245 - What do you think of this one?\\
246 - It's ugly. I hate it.\\
247 - So do I.\\
248 - My, you're a, you're a smart little boy.\\
249 - You seem to be practicing pretty hard.\\
250 - I hope you're not planning\\
251 - on doing something stupid, like winning.\\
252 - Look, guys, I know you want me to lose,\\
253 - but Spangler insisted I play a real game.\\
254 - Francis, you can't win.\\
255 - If you do, Spangler's going to take it out on us.\\
256 - Remember when Hendrix beat him playing horse\\
257 - on a lucky shot?\\
258 - We couldn't watch anything but PBS for a week.\\
259 - And that was during pledge drive, man.\\
260 - Guys, come on. Do you have any idea\\
261 - what Spangler's going to do to me if I lose?\\
262 - Do you know what we're going to do to you if you win?\\
263 - Where were we?\\
264 - Mom! You have to stop Reese!\\
265 - He's being a total jerk!\\
266 - Malcolm, does it look like I'm open for business?\\
267 - You have done nothing but pester us.\\
268 - Is it too much to ask\\
269 - that your father and I enjoy one day?\\
270 - But Reese is the one... I don't want to hear it.\\
271 - You either take care of this yourself\\
272 - or I'm gonna lock the two of you in the car\\
273 - for the rest of the day. I mean it.\\
274 - Lifeguard, help!\\
275 - My brother-- he can't swim.\\
276 - Out of the way, guys!\\
277 - Drowning boy!\\
278 - Out of the way!\\
279 - Drowning boy!\\
280 - Drowning boy! Drowning boy!\\
281 - Drowning boy!\\
282 - Give him some air, guys.\\
283 - Give him some air. Back up.\\
284 - Sir!\\
285 - Let the people who work here do that.\\
286 - Now we're even.\\
287 - And then I was playing with my imaginary friend,\\
288 - and Reese hit me because he said\\
289 - I shouldn't talk to myself.\\
290 - Well, Reese is a horrid little boy.\\
291 - I mean, there's nothing wrong with having\\
292 - an imaginary friend.\\
293 - I talk to my Harold all the time.\\
294 - You do? Of course.\\
295 - He's here right now.\\
296 - Would he like a cookie?\\
297 - Sure.\\
298 - No, no, no.\\
299 - He's over there.\\
300 - Yes! Yes!\\
301 - Sorry, sir.\\
302 - It's understandable, cadet.\\
303 - I've seen professionals do much worse.\\
304 - I guess the pool gods are smiling on me today.\\
305 - But then, the pool gods can be fickle.\\
306 - That's okay, sir.\\
307 - You'll win the next one.\\
308 - Sir, what are you doing?\\
309 - I think I'm losing.\\
310 - And gracefully, I'd like to be noted.\\
311 - But you could have made that shot.\\
312 - I could say the same thing to you.\\
313 - There were at least a dozen shots\\
314 - that you've held back on.\\
315 - But since you seem to be motivated more\\
316 - by losing,\\
317 - I'm going to beat you at your own game.\\
318 - Huh?\\
319 - I'm going down, cadet.\\
320 - I'm going down hard.\\
321 - But, sir, these guys are going to kick my ass if I win.\\
322 - Well, that's just gravy.\\
323 - May the best man lose.\\
324 - Fudge! It seems I've scratched again.\\
325 - Well, you seem to be on a roll, cadet.\\
326 -     Ah-ooh    \\
327 -     I'm mixin' business with leather    \\
328 -     Christmas with Heather    \\
329 -     Freaks flock together    \\
330 -     Makin' all the B-boys scream    \\
331 -     All right    \\
332 -     All right    \\
333 -     Turn it up now    \\
334 -     Turn it up now    \\
335 -     All right         All right    \\
336 -     Turn it up now    \\
337 -     Ah-ah-ah    \\
338 -     Word up to the man thing    \\
339 -     She's always cold lamping    \\
340 -     Visine at the canteen    \\
341 -     I just want to watch you dance.    \\
342 -     Can you hear the drums, Fernando?    \\
343 -     I remember long ago another starry night like this    \\
344 -     In the firelight, Fernando    \\
345 -     You were humming to yourself    \\
346 -     And softly strumming your guitar    \\
347 -     I could hear the distant drums    \\
348 -     And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar    \\
349 -     There was something in the air that night    \\
350 -     The stars were bright, Fernando    \\
351 -     They were shining there for you and me    \\
352 -     For liberty, Fernando    \\
353 -     Though we never thought that we could lose    \\
354 -     There's no regret    \\
355 -     If I had to do the same again    \\
356 -     I would, my friend, Fernando    \\
357 -     There was something in the air that night    \\
358 -     The stars were bright...    \\
359 - Before you say anything, Malcolm,\\
360 - I just want to tell you,\\
361 - I don't want to hear it.\\
362 - Can't you give your mother and me five minutes of peace?\\
363 - You know what? You can have the rest of the day\\
364 - because I've given up.\\
365 - I'm not going to have any fun anyway, so why try?\\
366 - As long as we're on the same page.\\
367 - Today sucked.\\
368 - I've done nothing except chicken out,\\
369 - get laughed at and fight with Reese.\\
370 - So now I'm just going to lie down,\\
371 - enjoy the sun and wait for them to take me home.\\
372 - Now we're even.\\
373 - Now we're...\\
374 - Boys!\\
375 - Reese,\\
376 - I've done some soul-searching in the last few minutes\\
377 - and hereby offer my complete and full apology.\\
378 - It was very wrong of me.\\
379 - I'm truly sorry for my childish and inappropriate behavior\\
380 - and I'd like to think that the terrible guilt I'm feeling\\
381 - is punishment enough for...\\
382 - Hey, there's no cutting in line.\\
383 - Oh, it's you again.\\
384 - Reese, I am so sorry.\\
385 - I really, really mean it.\\
386 - Do you think we're wealthy?!\\
387 - What?!\\
388 - Do you think we're wealthy?\\
389 - Wealthy people\\
390 - drive fancy cars.\\
391 - They buy fresh pasta.\\
392 - Do we do any of those things?\\
393 - No! Wealthy people\\
394 - can afford to have their vacations ruined.\\
395 - No big deal. They just pick up and they go again.\\
396 - Your father and I\\
397 - work so hard.\\
398 - We work so long.\\
399 - What is wrong with you two?!\\
400 - Are you aborigines?!\\
401 - Every time I turn around, I hear someone\\
402 - screaming and fighting, and I pray to God\\
403 - it's someone else's kids, but it's not.\\
404 - It's always you!\\
405 - Sane children would appreciate this,\\
406 - but you have to keep nattering at each other like a couple\\
407 - of rabid monkeys!\\
408 - It is not enough that you do this every day.\\
409 - You have to make me suffer, too.\\
410 - So help me!\\
411 - Don't you dare!\\
412 - Arms and legs crossed at all times!\\
413 - That is the bravest thing I've ever seen you do.\\
414 - Yeah.\\
415 - You're going to die.\\
416 - I know.\\
417 - So, do you think she's okay?\\
418 - This is the last time I take you boys anywhere!\\
419 - Good playing, cadet.\\
420 - Same to you, sir.\\
421 - Hey, who won?\\
422 - Who cares, man?
\section {Malcolm in the Middle Season 02}
\subsection {Episode 01: Traffic Jam 2}
1 - Okay, here's the thing about my family:\\
2 - we don't go on a lot of outings together, but when we do,\\
3 - there's a little tradition we always end up observing.\\
4 - When you say lifetime ban,\\
5 - I mean, whose lifetime are you talking about?\\
6 - Ow! Mom, let my feet\\
7 - touch the ground.\\
8 - Don't you ever ask me for anything ever again.\\
9 - I should've just given birth to chimps.\\
10 - Then at least I know to expect this kind of behavior.\\
11 - Ow!\\
12 - Believe it or not, I actually envy Dewey.\\
13 - He got to stay home and play with the babysitter.\\
14 - And then the ambulance came, but there was this balloon.\\
15 - And then I was chasing it,\\
16 - and then I didn't know where I was.\\
17 - And then I chased a bag,\\
18 - and then I really didn't know where I was.\\
19 - And then I saw you,\\
20 - and I thought maybe you could help me\\
21 - because you helped that other girl-- the one in the movie.\\
22 - So if you could just come to life and help me,\\
23 - I'd really appreciate it.\\
24 - Thanks anyway.\\
25 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
26 -     I don't know    \\
27 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     And you're not so big    \\
32 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
33 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
34 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
35 -     And you're not so big    \\
36 -     Life is unfair.    \\
37 - It's 95 degrees outside.\\
38 - It's 110 in here.\\
39 - We have to run the heater\\
40 - so the radiator doesn't boil over.\\
41 - Hal, stop swerving.\\
42 - This darn silver Toyota's been tailgating me\\
43 - for the last three miles.\\
44 - Just pull over, let him pass.\\
45 - Oh, flashing the brights.\\
46 - It's going to be like that, huh?\\
47 - Huh!\\
48 - Good lord, Hal, he could have a gun.\\
49 - Just let him pass.\\
50 - All right, silver Toyota, you win this round.\\
51 - Go ahead, get there two seconds sooner!\\
52 - That guy is just an accident waiting to happen.\\
53 -     A, B, C, D    \\
54 -     A, B, C, D    \\
55 -     A, B, C, D...    \\
56 - It's a good thing I found you.\\
57 - It's not very safe for a little boy like you\\
58 - to be all by yourself.\\
59 -     A, B, C, D...    \\
60 - Oh, don't you worry.\\
61 - I'm going to get you back home to your parents.\\
62 - They must be worried sick.\\
63 -     A, B, C, D    \\
64 -     A, B, C, D...    \\
65 - It's "E," dear.\\
66 -     A, B, C, D, E.    \\
67 -     E.    \\
68 - I know.\\
69 -     A, B, C, D    \\
70 -     A, B, C, D...    \\
71 - "Sugar, corn syrup and gelatin."\\
72 - How can something so simple be so delicious?\\
73 - That stuff's nasty, Francis.\\
74 - To the unsophisticated palate, yes,\\
75 - but to me, the Candy Quack is nature's perfect food.\\
76 - I'll bet I could eat a hundred of them.\\
77 - No way. All that marshmallow would expand in your stomach.\\
78 - You wouldn't get past 50.\\
79 - Okay, there's where you're wrong, Joe.\\
80 - See, the marshmallow wouldn't expand.\\
81 - It would dissolve.\\
82 - I'd never get full.\\
83 - In fact, I don't...\\
84 - Will you just shut up!\\
85 - I have sat back\\
86 - and said nothing while you've gone on and on\\
87 - about how you can eat a hundred of this\\
88 - and lift a hundred of that.\\
89 - The Quacks would expand.\\
90 - You're an idiot if you think different.\\
91 - Okay, let me tell you something.\\
92 - If I say I can eat a hundred Quacks,\\
93 - you can take that as a bona fide guarantee.\\
94 - And there's no need to resort to personal attacks,\\
95 - because I'd hate to raise\\
96 - the whole issue of you wearing boxers in the shower.\\
97 - That was so cool.\\
98 - Did you see that truck jackknife and flip over\\
99 - and that wheel fly through the air?\\
100 - An explosion would've been nice,\\
101 - but you can't have everything.\\
102 - Yeah, Reese, this is great.\\
103 - Now we're stuck here for hours\\
104 - with no food and no air-conditioning.\\
105 - I guess it could be worse.\\
106 - I could be the guy in the silver Toyota.\\
107 - Why can't you just open one lane?\\
108 - Lady, we have to wait for the crane to get here\\
109 - before we can even think of opening this road to traffic.\\
110 - Yeah, but if you just moved a couple of those police cars,\\
111 - there'd be enough room to just pass on the shoulder.\\
112 - I mean, this is just plain stupid.\\
113 - Ma'am, don't call a police officer stupid.\\
114 - What, that's a law now?\\
115 - Look, my freshman year,\\
116 - I ate seven pounds of grapes in one sitting.\\
117 - I think I know what my body is capable of.\\
118 - We're not talking about grapes, Francis.\\
119 - We're talking about pure sucrose.\\
120 - The human body simply\\
121 - cannot absorb the sugar in 100 Quacks.\\
122 - Yeah!\\
123 - Hey, in extreme cases,\\
124 - the human pancreas has been known to increase\\
125 - its insulin production by up to 60%.\\
126 - Yeah!\\
127 - Listen, your pancreas can produce enough insulin\\
128 - to fill a swimming pool.\\
129 - That doesn't mean squat\\
130 - if your adrenal gland can't distribute it\\
131 - into your bloodstream fast enough!\\
132 - Yeah!\\
133 - Gentlemen, gentlemen!\\
134 - This argument is pointless.\\
135 - One.\\
136 - Look, look at that-- they're just standing around.\\
137 - Yeah, 500 cars full of people who actually have\\
138 - someplace to go, and they're just standing there talking.\\
139 - What is there to discuss?!\\
140 - Hey! Let me clear something up for you!\\
141 - This is a car wreck!\\
142 - You're a road crew. Do your job!\\
143 - Are you even listening to me?\\
144 - That could have been me.\\
145 - Yeah, well, Hal, it could've been all of us.\\
146 - Nope! No, that car was sliced\\
147 - right through the driver's seat.\\
148 - You and the boys would've walked away without a scratch.\\
149 - This totally sucks.\\
150 - It's like an oven out here.\\
151 - What is the point of wandering aimlessly through traffic?\\
152 - So we can find cool stuff like this.\\
153 - Smells like gasoline.\\
154 - Reese, can't we just go back to the car?\\
155 - My feet are killing...\\
156 - Ice cream man!\\
157 - Go away!\\
158 - There is no ice cream in the truck!\\
159 - He's lying!\\
160 - There's tons of ice cream in there!\\
161 - The ice cream in the truck is not for sale!\\
162 - It is against the law\\
163 - for me to sell ice cream in the middle of traffic!\\
164 - This is just wrong!\\
165 - You could make money and please children.\\
166 - This is a senseless act.\\
167 - You are evil-- pure evil!\\
168 - Well, if you kids are not willing\\
169 - to discuss this sensibly...\\
170 - You son of a...!\\
171 - Look, there's nothing you can do.\\
172 - Yes, there is.\\
173 - I can... I can...\\
174 - And the Nobel Prize goes to...\\
175 - Hey, you're talking about my brother.\\
176 - Good one.\\
177 - I'm Jessica-- gray Volvo.\\
178 - Malcolm-- crappy minivan.\\
179 - Do you want to go check out the crash site?\\
180 - Sure. You know, my dad practically caused it.\\
181 - Wow.\\
182 - What time is it now?\\
183 - It's still 4:00.\\
184 - You have to wait at least a minute\\
185 - for the time to change, dear.\\
186 - What time is it in China?\\
187 - Well, sweetie,\\
188 - I think they're a good 20 hour...\\
189 - Do you speak Chinese?\\
190 - Well, no. I...\\
191 - Is Chinatown in China?\\
192 - Honey, if you want\\
193 - an answer to a question, you have to first wait...\\
194 - What does this toe do?\\
195 - You know what? I need to buy a pack of cigarettes--\\
196 - for the first time in 20 years.\\
197 - Grape juice, please.\\
198 - He's getting away!\\
199 - Hello.\\
200 - Think about it, Lois.\\
201 - I stopped to tie my shoe in the parking lot.\\
202 - If I hadn't done that,\\
203 - we would've been on the road 20 seconds sooner.\\
204 - I would've been 200 yards ahead of where I was,\\
205 - and then I would've been the silver Toyota.\\
206 - And if you hadn't rented  Body Heat,\\
207 - we never would have had Dewey.\\
208 - It's all an intricate tapestry, Hal.\\
209 - Ma'am?\\
210 - Yes. Hello... D-Did you ask your supervisor?\\
211 - Yes, and this phone is for\\
212 - emergency roadside assistance only, ma'am.\\
213 - I can't connect you to a private line.\\
214 - Look, I have got to get through to my babysit...\\
215 - Look. J-Just let me talk to the supervisor.\\
216 - One moment, ma'am.\\
217 - Hello. This is the supervisor.\\
218 - No, it isn't.\\
219 - You're just disguising your voice.\\
220 - No, I'm not. I'm really the supervisor.\\
221 - You can't do this!\\
222 - Ma'am, I'm about to be replaced by a machine.\\
223 - I can do whatever I damn well please.\\
224 - H-Hey! Where do you think you're going, young lady?\\
225 - It's okay. My dad's an investigator for the D.O.T.\\
226 - Oh, there he is. Hi, Daddy!\\
227 - Okay.\\
228 - Whoa. Your dad's a crash investigator?\\
229 - Here's a little secret, Malcolm:\\
230 - whenever you want something, everybody's your dad.\\
231 - Hi, Daddy!\\
232 - Okay, she's cute, she's smart, and she even lies to cops.\\
233 - I may be in over my head here.\\
234 - Forty-six!\\
235 - Forty-seven!\\
236 - Forty-eight!\\
237 - And when you're constantly moving from town to town,\\
238 - it's really hard to make friends.\\
239 - So, yeah, I acted out, I guess.\\
240 - But who wouldn't in my situation?\\
241 - All right, I got to let you off here.\\
242 - Okay.\\
243 - Sixty-one!\\
244 - Sixty-two!\\
245 - Sixty-three!\\
246 - Sixty-two!\\
247 - Sixty-one!\\
248 - Sixty-two!\\
249 - Sixty-three!\\
250 - Malcolm, you have got to check out this view.\\
251 - Ow! I hate pricker bushes.\\
252 - What fruit are they trying to protect anyway?\\
253 - Do you see anything on here worth protecting?\\
254 - What are we doing up here?\\
255 - Just enjoying the sights.\\
256 - And check out that crazy lady.\\
257 - So tell me about this gifted class.\\
258 - It's horrible.\\
259 - I'm surrounded by Krelboynes.\\
260 - I have to do twice as much homework\\
261 - as anyone else in my grade.\\
262 - I have to take all these college-prep classes...\\
263 - What a nightmare.\\
264 - If you're not careful,\\
265 - you might get a full scholarship to Harvard.\\
266 - You don't understand.\\
267 - Malcolm, you've been bellyaching nonstop\\
268 - for an hour and a half.\\
269 - Seriously, all you do is bitch.\\
270 - I happen to bitch the perfect amount\\
271 - for someone in my situation.\\
272 - Today is the perfect example.\\
273 - Look at this mess.\\
274 - What's good about this?\\
275 - Well... if it weren't for this...\\
276 - we never would have met.\\
277 - How could I not see that coming?\\
278 - This girl's incredible!\\
279 - Ow!\\
280 - Ow!\\
281 - Pricker bush.\\
282 - And I keep rolling it around in my head--\\
283 - how much time do I have left?\\
284 - And what have I done with my life?\\
285 - I mean, what is my contribution?\\
286 - You go home at night knowing\\
287 - that you have helped to make the world a better place\\
288 - by forging that thin blue line,\\
289 - and that is real, man.\\
290 - If I could just once\\
291 - feel that sense of accomplishment, it...\\
292 - Do you know how special you are?\\
293 - Do you?\\
294 - Z... Y... X...\\
295 - W...\\
296 - Okay, let me get this straight. We have been waiting\\
297 - all afternoon for a crane, and now the crane is here.\\
298 - That's right.\\
299 - And the man who works the crane, he's here, too.\\
300 - That's right.\\
301 - Then why is nothing happening?!\\
302 - Look, we can't touch anything\\
303 - until the investigators sign off on the accident report.\\
304 - Yeah, but they must have been done hours ago. Where are they?\\
305 - That's a whole nother department.\\
306 - It's really not my job to know.\\
307 - Start... the...  crane.\\
308 - You can't tell me what to do.\\
309 - Hey, not so fast, Charlie!\\
310 - Ah! Let go of me!\\
311 - What do you think you're doing, huh?\\
312 - Nothing! I'm just going for a walk! What the hell's going on?!\\
313 - This kid was trying to break into your truck.\\
314 - Let go of me!\\
315 - I just want some damn ice cream.\\
316 - You don't deserve ice cream.\\
317 - Yeah, well, you don't deserve to be an ice cream man!\\
318 - Ow!\\
319 - Come here, you punk! You little punk!\\
320 - That will teach you to mess with me!\\
321 - I was a surgeon in my country!\\
322 - Way to go!\\
323 - Hit me again.\\
324 - Come on! Come on!\\
325 - Ha!\\
326 - Looks like the human body can only accept 96 Quacks.\\
327 - Check and mate.\\
328 - Francis, just four more.\\
329 - You can do it.\\
330 - Can't...\\
331 - Quacks...\\
332 - Dying...\\
333 - Hey, no one said he had to eat all the Quacks.\\
334 - They just have to be inside his body, right?\\
335 - He did it!\\
336 - 100 Quacks!\\
337 - You got heart.\\
338 - Hey, way to go, Francis.\\
339 - Man, that was way cooler than the time\\
340 - Davis did a thousand sit-ups.\\
341 - Impossible.\\
342 - I mean, Davis is in pretty good shape,\\
343 - but a thousand sit-ups?\\
344 - You're just begging for a double hernia.\\
345 - Man, it's that kind of small-minded thinking\\
346 - that keeps you from recognizing true greatness.\\
347 - What are you talking about?\\
348 - You're always arguing about something, man.\\
349 - A thousand sit-ups? Are you crazy?\\
350 - Pleasure doing business with you, Kyle.\\
351 - Nice moves out there, Erin.\\
352 - And here's your share, Mr. Wells.\\
353 - That man left us no choice.\\
354 - Try the green one!\\
355 - Come on out of there, ma'am.\\
356 - You order them to move this thing!\\
357 - Let's just get you out of the crane,\\
358 - and then we'll have a little talk.\\
359 - Don't you dare patronize me.\\
360 - Okay, you don't want to be patronized?\\
361 - I'll be blunt. You're a control freak.\\
362 - I see them all the time.\\
363 - But guess what? This is a traffic jam.\\
364 - It is out of your control. Yeah, but I...\\
365 - You can't boss it around.\\
366 - You can't yell at it and expect it to listen.\\
367 - I have been...\\
368 - It will end when it ends!\\
369 - You just have to live with it.\\
370 - There's absolutely nothing you can do about it.\\
371 - Whose damn dog is this?!\\
372 - I said, whose damn dog is this?!\\
373 - He's trapped inside.\\
374 - All the windows are rolled up.\\
375 - It's... it's, like, 90 degrees out here!\\
376 - Okay, okay...\\
377 - it is nobody's damn dog.\\
378 - Then I guess nobody's going to mind if I just do this!\\
379 - Oh... don't be scared, little doggy.\\
380 - Oh, no.\\
381 - Everything's going to be o...\\
382 - Oh, poor thing.\\
383 - Okay, I got it.\\
384 - I was hoping I could deliver a baby\\
385 - in a taxicab or something, but... a life is a life.\\
386 - Oh, now look at you.\\
387 - Huh? How did you get like this?\\
388 - There you go, pal.\\
389 - I'm impressed.\\
390 - You actually have a working first-aid kit.\\
391 - We used to, but my brother ate all the Band-Aids.\\
392 - I think you'll live.\\
393 - You know, I was thinking,\\
394 - maybe sometime we can do something.\\
395 - It'd be cool if...\\
396 - You're from Canada?!\\
397 - We're here on vacation.\\
398 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
399 - Because then you would have spent the whole day grousing.\\
400 - I knew this was too good to be true.\\
401 - I mean, why should I get to meet someone\\
402 - who's smart, funny, not a Krelboyne,\\
403 - not a member of my family?\\
404 - But we did meet, Malcolm, and it was awesome.\\
405 - You know, it's okay to enjoy something\\
406 - even if it's just for a little while.\\
407 - Come on, we had fun.\\
408 - No, we didn't.\\
409 - You just said we did.\\
410 - That was before I knew this was all a big waste of time.\\
411 - Doogie, come back to the car, honey.\\
412 - Bobby, get a move on, sport.\\
413 - Malcolm! Reese! Move!\\
414 - I got to go.\\
415 - Just pull out, Hal.\\
416 - I am waiting my turn.\\
417 - Malcolm!\\
418 - Malcolm! Here's my phone number!\\
419 - Call me!\\
420 - That... was so much fun!\\
421 - Who would have thought a traffic jam would be so cool?\\
422 - We should totally do this again.\\
423 - When are we going on another road trip?\\
424 - Oh, how about next week?\\
425 - See you, kid.\\
426 - Bye, Santa!\\
427 - Hi, Mom.\\
428 - Dewey, where's the babysitter?\\
429 - She went away.\\
430 - You got rid of another babysitter?\\
431 - What is wrong with you kids?\\
432 - Then I drove off with a potato chip man.\\
433 - Then I picked apples.\\
434 - Then we all went to jail. Then I played the...
\subsection {Episode 02: Halloween Approximately}
1 - Nine days past expiration.\\
2 - Ugh!\\
3 - Here.\\
4 - Ugh! Turned carbonated.\\
5 - Expired two months ago.\\
6 - You don't have the guts.\\
7 - When was the last Christmas we had eggnog?\\
8 - I think before Dewey.\\
9 - It's all you, man.\\
10 - This is a game that has no winners.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - Well, that's the last of my Halloween candy.\\
24 - All that sugar, all those cavities.\\
25 - We're the real winners, guys.\\
26 - Are you coming over Saturday?\\
27 - For what?\\
28 - For what?!\\
29 - The Leonid meteor shower!\\
30 - Only once in a lifetime\\
31 - do the mighty Leonids reveal\\
32 - their full beauty before bedtime.\\
33 - I wish I could, guys,\\
34 - but Francis is coming home this weekend.\\
35 - And since he missed Halloween last week,\\
36 - we're going to hang out together.\\
37 - Are you sure?\\
38 - Stevie has a new telescope,\\
39 - and I was thinking that after the meteor shower\\
40 - we could watch Mrs. Feldman shower.\\
41 - And you call yourself a scientist.\\
42 - It's been a week, sweetie.\\
43 - Take off the costume.\\
44 - But I like it.\\
45 - It's filthy. Come here.\\
46 - Go put some clothes on, sweetie.\\
47 - What you doing? I don't know.\\
48 - There's something about the way you swish that brush around\\
49 - that just drives me...\\
50 - Damn! That blue car!\\
51 - That's three times this week.\\
52 - That joyriding son of a...\\
53 - Hal, just call the police.\\
54 - I have.\\
55 - They won't do anything.\\
56 - Lois, I swear, one of these days,\\
57 - I'm going to catch up to that punk,\\
58 - I'm going to drag him out of his car,\\
59 - and I'm going to beat him senseless\\
60 - until he understands that there's a certain thing\\
61 - called the law.\\
62 - Don't let him get to you. Come on.\\
63 - Well, when's it going to stop?\\
64 - When Dewey here is smashed\\
65 - into a lifeless pulp?\\
66 - Put some clothes on, son.\\
67 - Halloween sucked this year without Francis.\\
68 - The eggs and shaving cream I can keep.\\
69 - But what am I ever going to do with this stuff?\\
70 - It was supposed to be\\
71 - our first Halloween as mindless vandals.\\
72 - But Francis got in trouble at school,\\
73 - so we had to go trick-or-treating\\
74 - like a bunch of little kids.\\
75 - Oh, look at you three.\\
76 - What are you?\\
77 - A beat-up hillbilly.\\
78 - And you? Just give us the candy.\\
79 - Oh, I bet you're a ghost.\\
80 - I'm a marshmallow.\\
81 - Oh, and a cute one at that.\\
82 - I just want to stick a fork in your belly\\
83 - and roast you over an open flame\\
84 - till you're nice and crispy.\\
85 - It's embarrassing at our age--\\
86 - coming home with candy.\\
87 - Give me that.\\
88 - Hey!\\
89 - Hey! Hey!\\
90 - Pull over, you gutless...\\
91 - I got kids!\\
92 - You lousy...\\
93 - ...son of a...\\
94 - This guy is a menace.\\
95 - Now, I've tried to get him on my own,\\
96 - but the truth is, it's not a job for one man.\\
97 - It is a community problem,\\
98 - and all we have to do\\
99 - is work together.\\
100 - If we all keep an eye out for this guy,\\
101 - I think we should be able to catch him pretty quickly.\\
102 - Why don't you clean up your yard?\\
103 - What?\\
104 - Why don't you just move?\\
105 - Look, this isn't about me.\\
106 - These meetings are always about you.\\
107 - You're the sole reason we meet.\\
108 - Those kids of yours should be in jail.\\
109 - How would you like it if you scrimped and saved\\
110 - all your life to live in a nice neighborhood,\\
111 - and then a bunch of godless monsters moved in\\
112 - and destroyed all your dreams?\\
113 - Okay, back to the subject. I'd like to pass around\\
114 - a sign-up sheet for a stakeout.\\
115 - Well... thanks for your time.\\
116 - You're welcome.\\
117 - Hello?\\
118 - Hi, Francis.\\
119 - Welcome home.\\
120 - Too old to hug your mom?\\
121 - Mom, I've been waiting\\
122 - at the bus station for three hours.\\
123 - Why didn't anybody come to pick me up?\\
124 - What?\\
125 - I sent your father.\\
126 - Oh, Francis, I'm sorry.\\
127 - He's battling his archenemy.\\
128 - What, the squirrel's back?\\
129 - No, it's a human this time.\\
130 - Francis!\\
131 - Hey!\\
132 - Did you guys tear it up on Halloween?\\
133 - Oh, yeah. We were out of control.\\
134 - Kids were running; people were screaming;\\
135 - babies were crying.\\
136 - We went trick-or-treating.\\
137 - It just didn't feel right without you.\\
138 - I had fun. Shut up, Dewey.\\
139 - Couldn't you have gotten in trouble after Halloween?\\
140 - Guys, I'm sorry.\\
141 - I know I let you down,\\
142 - but I really didn't have a choice.\\
143 - The commandant's fake leg was just lying there in the closet\\
144 - begging for a novelty bumper sticker.\\
145 - It was a snap decision,\\
146 - but I really think I did the right thing.\\
147 - That's all right. There's always next year.\\
148 - Well, why do we have to wait a year?\\
149 - Guys, Halloween\\
150 - isn't a date on the calendar.\\
151 - Yeah, it is.\\
152 - It's the 31st.\\
153 - No, Halloween is in your hearts.\\
154 - Every time a little kid cries in fear,\\
155 - that's Halloween.\\
156 - Every time something repulsive\\
157 - ends up in a mailbox, that is Halloween.\\
158 - As long as you carry the spirit of destruction\\
159 - and vandalism in your hearts, every day is Halloween.\\
160 - No, look, it is the 31st.\\
161 - Men, we are going to have Halloween this weekend.\\
162 - Hal, you have been out here for seven hours.\\
163 - Come to bed.\\
164 - Look, Lois, I am doing this for the boys.\\
165 - We can't just let our street become a speedway.\\
166 - Got to protect my family,\\
167 - even if it means sitting in this van\\
168 - every night for a month.\\
169 - It's a matter of principle.\\
170 - Mmm. Before you go to sleep,\\
171 - I'd like you to replace my pee jar.\\
172 - No!\\
173 - Son of a...\\
174 - Boys, the time has come.\\
175 - You're about to see the device\\
176 - that will change the face of Halloween forever.\\
177 - Behold.\\
178 - That's not a flying chocolate maker.\\
179 - This is just a bunch of tubes.\\
180 - Trust me.\\
181 - I do trust you,\\
182 - but I expected something a little more...\\
183 - Oh, my God. Will this work?\\
184 - Absolutely.\\
185 - What? What is it?\\
186 - It looks like an incredibly powerful slingshot.\\
187 - A slingshot capable of hurling objects over a distance\\
188 - of two city blocks.\\
189 - Picture yourself--\\
190 - you're walking down the street,\\
191 - you're minding your own business,\\
192 - when all of a sudden... bam!\\
193 - You're hit by a ten-pound balloon\\
194 - filled with shaving cream, paint\\
195 - or any number of foul-smelling liquids.\\
196 - And you never, ever know who did it.\\
197 - It's the perfect weapon.\\
198 - Reese, are you crying?\\
199 - No.\\
200 - What are you doing?\\
201 - I've had it, Lois.\\
202 - I'm building a speed bump.\\
203 - Hal, would you look at yourself?\\
204 - It's 4:00 in the morning.\\
205 - You're out here in your pajamas\\
206 - mixing cement in a wheelbarrow.\\
207 - It's going to rip the suspension right out from under him.\\
208 - There'll be some chassis damage.\\
209 - Oh, boy, I'd hate to be the one\\
210 - who has to realign his connecting rods.\\
211 - That guy's not going to know what hit him.\\
212 - Yee-ha!\\
213 - Okay, we got eggs,\\
214 - shaving cream, water balloons.\\
215 - I don't know, I'm just not feeling it.\\
216 - These eggs are pretty rotten.\\
217 - Yeah, I know, but it's all just so...\\
218 - standard.\\
219 - I mean, we have a whole new breed of weapon here.\\
220 - We need to live up to that.\\
221 - We need to start thinking outside the box.\\
222 - So if you'll just spend a couple of hours\\
223 - waiting for him here,\\
224 - I know the guy will come racing by,\\
225 - and then you can arrest him\\
226 - and this whole thing will be over once and for all.\\
227 - I want some help protecting my family.\\
228 - So you weren't held up at gunpoint?\\
229 - Okay, that was a lie.\\
230 - But I've been calling you people for weeks\\
231 - and not getting any help.\\
232 - No one is listening to me.\\
233 - Is this your speed bump?\\
234 - It was a good bump, Hal.\\
235 - You want a sandwich?\\
236 - Easy.\\
237 - Good.\\
238 - Just let me talk to him.\\
239 - I'll get this whole thing straightened out in two minutes.\\
240 - Get the car.\\
241 - Let's go through this one more time.\\
242 - Malcolm, what's your job?\\
243 - Aimer.\\
244 - Reese? Loader.\\
245 - Dewey, what do you do\\
246 - if you see Mom and Dad coming?\\
247 - Excellent.\\
248 - Where'd they go, anyway?\\
249 - Okay, look-- we've got his license plate.\\
250 - We've got his address.\\
251 - That's more than enough to get...\\
252 - Hal!\\
253 - What are you doing?\\
254 - Shh. Get down.\\
255 - I'm letting the air out of his tires.\\
256 - No, Hal.\\
257 - Okay, but then we go home.\\
258 - Hello.\\
259 - I have an idea.\\
260 - You can't steal his car.\\
261 - I'm not stealing his car.\\
262 - I'm just taking it elsewhere for a while.\\
263 - It'll teach the kid a lesson.\\
264 - No, Hal.\\
265 - I'm putting the key in the lock. No, Hal.\\
266 - I'm opening the door.\\
267 - No, Hal.\\
268 - I'm getting in the car. No.\\
269 - I am turning on the engine.\\
270 - Oh, ow. Just...\\
271 - This is crazy.\\
272 - You can't just take a person's car.\\
273 - There are laws...!\\
274 - Oh. Oh... serious engine.\\
275 - He must have bored out the cylinders in this puppy.\\
276 - Pull over.\\
277 - Remember that Maverick I used to have?\\
278 - I don't want to talk about your old muscle car.\\
279 - Scared?\\
280 - Of course I'm scared.\\
281 - You've turned into a crazy person.\\
282 - Do it again.\\
283 - Oh! Oh!\\
284 - All right, let's try a test shot.\\
285 - Reese, just get me a small water balloon.\\
286 - Malcolm, you got me a target?\\
287 - We've got a target.\\
288 - Listen, you idiot, the optics on the Newtonian reflector\\
289 - don't even approach a Schmidt-Cassegrain.\\
290 - It's a nice century-- why don't you join it?\\
291 - Shrine burn center; admitting Kyle.\\
292 - Ladies!\\
293 - The stars.\\
294 - He's right.\\
295 - Why squabble when we have the Leonids?\\
296 - You hear something?\\
297 - Oh, my telescope!\\
298 - It's broken!\\
299 - Why my telescope?!\\
300 - Yes!\\
301 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
302 - Go! Go!\\
303 - Yeah.\\
304 -        \\
305 -     Well, there's a new weapon in the quest for knowledge    \\
306 -     You don't need school and you don't need college    \\
307 -     Forget the conventional 'cause there's a new way    \\
308 -     You'll learn it all and it won't take a single day    \\
309 -     Go from the nursery straight to university    \\
310 -     Stand proud in the face of adversity    \\
311 -     I've seen the future just in case you didn't know    \\
312 -     This is the future through your rear window    \\
313 -     I needed them all    \\
314 -     Like I needed a headache    \\
315 -     I dropped out of school    \\
316 -     And it wasn't a mistake    \\
317 -     Stop worrying about all the things you don't know    \\
318 -     Tune in and go through the rear window    \\
319 -     Don't worry if your life...    \\
320 - Yeah!\\
321 - Diaper!\\
322 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
323 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
324 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
325 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
326 - Yeah!\\
327 - Diaper!\\
328 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
329 - Diaper! Diaper! Diaper!\\
330 - Diaper! Oh...\\
331 - All right.\\
332 - No more of those.\\
333 -        \\
334 - Yes!\\
335 - I love you so much.\\
336 - I can't believe the power of this thing.\\
337 - If it was to fall in the wrong hands...\\
338 - I see an old lady.\\
339 - Reload! Reload! Reload! Reload!\\
340 - I'm serious, Hal.\\
341 - What are we going to do?\\
342 - The time to drop off the car and go home\\
343 - was, like, 20 miles ago.\\
344 - What if we just kept going?\\
345 - What are you talking about?\\
346 - I'm talking about you and me\\
347 - running away and spending the rest of our lives\\
348 - on some... I don't know, some hidden beach in Mexico\\
349 - with no jobs and no kids.\\
350 - Oh, it's not that simple, Hal.\\
351 - Why not?\\
352 - I mean, we would have to change our names, but...\\
353 - I'd be Raul.\\
354 - You'd be Consuela.\\
355 - Consuela?\\
356 - S  .\\
357 - You think they'd send the  federales  after us?\\
358 - Huh! Of course.\\
359 - But they'd never find us.\\
360 - We'd be outlaws.\\
361 - Oh, we'd be legends.\\
362 - We'd be living every parent's dream.\\
363 - We'd be folk heroes.\\
364 - Like Bonnie and Clyde.\\
365 - Raul and Consuela.\\
366 - Spearing fish.\\
367 - Climbing for coconuts.\\
368 - Living naked as monkeys.\\
369 - Oh... Raul.\\
370 - Yeah!\\
371 - I think I speak for all of us\\
372 - when I say that tonight ruled!\\
373 - Totally.\\
374 - We own you all.\\
375 - No one is safe.\\
376 - We are the kings of this block.\\
377 - Did you hear me, world?\\
378 - Violence just got a little more random!\\
379 - Reload! Reload!\\
380 - This is incredible.\\
381 - Their accuracy is amazing.\\
382 - Make it stop!\\
383 - Who are these guys?\\
384 - It's tofu.\\
385 - Angle: 47.9 degrees.\\
386 - Check.\\
387 - Brakes locked.\\
388 - This is for all the times\\
389 - I've been called "butt-tweefer."\\
390 - Fire!\\
391 - What do you mean, Krelboynes?\\
392 - I guess they've built their own catapult.\\
393 - That's impossible.\\
394 - How could they do that?\\
395 - Where would they get the materials?\\
396 - It's a funnel and surgical tubing.\\
397 - Stevie's garage is filled with that stuff.\\
398 - What are we going to do?\\
399 - We're going to fight.\\
400 - They're Krelboynes.\\
401 - They're nothing.\\
402 - We can fight. We can fight.\\
403 - We can fight.\\
404 - We can fight. We can fight.\\
405 - We have to surrender.\\
406 - Francis is right.\\
407 - We have to give up, Reese.\\
408 - Come on, you wussies.\\
409 - Just shoot me over there.\\
410 - I'll kick their asses myself.\\
411 - Get it off!\\
412 - Oh, my God!\\
413 - Get it off!\\
414 - They're surrendering.\\
415 - And I suppose I've never been offered the chance to surrender.\\
416 - Keep firing!\\
417 - Well, they won't even let us surrender honorably.\\
418 - Boys, it's time to run away like cowards.\\
419 - Well, there is some comfort in knowing\\
420 - what the next two hours of my life are going to be like.\\
421 - Oh. Look.\\
422 - A shooting star.\\
423 - Well, I'm thinking much more clearly now.\\
424 - Yeah, I think we both are, Hal.\\
425 - I guess Mexico's not really an option.\\
426 - No, I don't think so.\\
427 - No. No.\\
428 - It would have been fun, though.\\
429 - Oh, yeah.\\
430 - So, what do we do now?\\
431 - Well, I assume the car has been reported stolen already,\\
432 - and we've probably left our share\\
433 - of DNA evidence in here.\\
434 - It's only a 30-mile walk.\\
435 - We'll be home for breakfast.\\
436 - You know, I'm glad we didn't run away.\\
437 - Yeah, me, too.\\
438 - What was my name again?\\
439 - Raul, baby. Oh, yeah.
\subsection {Episode 03: Loiss Birthday}
1 - There's a lot of good things about weekends:\\
2 - no school, cartoons.\\
3 - But the best thing about weekends is having a neighbor\\
4 - like old Mrs. Jansen.\\
5 - Trick or treat!\\
6 - Oh, my! Look at\\
7 - what nice costumes you have!\\
8 - Here's two for you\\
9 - and two for you.\\
10 - There.\\
11 - Thank you, Mrs. Jansen.\\
12 - Good-bye.\\
13 - Hey, before you condemn us,\\
14 - we're the only kids who even talk to her.\\
15 - So if it wasn't for us,\\
16 - she would have no human contact at all.\\
17 - We shoveled your walkway.\\
18 - Oh!\\
19 - It looks wonderful.\\
20 - Let me get my purse.\\
21 - Okay, now you can condemn us.\\
22 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
23 -     I don't know    \\
24 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
32 -     And you're not so big    \\
33 -     Life is unfair.    \\
34 - It's Mom's birthday.\\
35 - She took us down to the store where she works\\
36 - so we could buy presents for her.\\
37 - So far, it's working out pretty well.\\
38 - Reese, for crying out loud!\\
39 - It's killing me! I'm so close!\\
40 - Get your hand out of there!\\
41 - I can't!\\
42 - Ow!\\
43 - All right!\\
44 - I got it!\\
45 - Okay, now listen up.\\
46 - I'm going to give you each ten dollars\\
47 - to buy me something.\\
48 - We've never done this before.\\
49 - Usually on her birthday, we just make her stuff.\\
50 - Honey, it's... nice.\\
51 - It's a potato bank.\\
52 - I made it.\\
53 - Now, you can each get me something,\\
54 - or you can put your money together\\
55 - and get me... um, I don't know.\\
56 - Oh, well, now, look at that.\\
57 - A foot massager.\\
58 - Hey, and it's only $25.\\
59 - And you've got, uh, $30\\
60 - between you?\\
61 - Huh.\\
62 - Well, I'm sure whatever you get me, I'll love it.\\
63 - Now meet me back here in ten minutes...\\
64 - Stop pushing!\\
65 - Come on! Dewey, you...\\
66 - Lois!\\
67 - Hi, Craig.\\
68 - What are you doing here on your... day off?\\
69 - Oh, I just stopped in with the boys\\
70 - so they could buy me a birthday present.\\
71 - Oh!\\
72 - It's-it's your birthday?\\
73 - I'd-I'd completely forgotten.\\
74 - Seems like any other day, actually.\\
75 - Yeah, well...\\
76 - Craig to aisle seven.\\
77 - Of course, you can't blame me for forgetting.\\
78 - I've been so busy lately.\\
79 - Seems like I'm always hitting the weights at the gym,\\
80 - working on the guns.\\
81 - Craig, aisle seven.\\
82 - Yeah, and when I'm not at the gym,\\
83 - I'm usually with my Dixieland jazz group.\\
84 - Really? What do you play?\\
85 - I'm the costumer.\\
86 - You know, there are four different types of straw hats,\\
87 - and if you ever need those arm garters...\\
88 - Craig, I can see you.\\
89 - Bye.\\
90 - And it's my mom's birthday,\\
91 - so it means a lot to her for me to come home.\\
92 - Just as a coincidence,\\
93 - my friend Richie is throwing a huge party on the same day.\\
94 - But enough about me.\\
95 - I can't believe that you and your schoolmates\\
96 - have come all the way from Mozambique\\
97 - just to see a bunch of national parks and monuments.\\
98 - I mean, I don't want to criticize,\\
99 - but you really haven't seen America\\
100 - until you've seen the small towns,\\
101 - met the people,\\
102 - studied the way my friend Richie throws a keg party.\\
103 - You're wasting your time.\\
104 - She doesn't speak English.\\
105 - Oh.\\
106 - Which is just as well, because if she\\
107 - understood the crap you were feeding her,\\
108 - she'd laugh in your face.\\
109 - I, on the other hand, find your desperation charming.\\
110 - Really?\\
111 - Oh, well, there's plenty more where that came from.\\
112 - Get out of my way! Let go of me!\\
113 - Come on, move, move!\\
114 - Here you go, Mom-- happy birthday.\\
115 - Don't you want to wrap it?\\
116 - No, it's okay.\\
117 - An eyeglass repair kit.\\
118 - Box of throat lozenges.\\
119 - A dirt bike magazine.\\
120 - I might want to look at that when you're done.\\
121 - This cost you $30?\\
122 - No, it was, like, eight.\\
123 - This store's great, Mom.\\
124 - When can I have my candy?\\
125 - Relax, dude, we have 20 bucks worth.\\
126 - Shotgun!\\
127 - Hey! Wait!\\
128 - Mom, what's for dinner?\\
129 - Oh, I don't know.\\
130 - Why don't you have some candy.\\
131 - Yay!\\
132 - Dewey, take off the wrappers.\\
133 - Does Mom seem okay to you?\\
134 - What do you mean?\\
135 - I don't know.\\
136 - I think she might be upset about something.\\
137 - Maybe I should go ask if...\\
138 - Ooh. Skinny Fonzie.\\
139 - ...19, 20, 21, 22, 23.\\
140 - All here.\\
141 - You can go.\\
142 - This is my house.\\
143 - Can't you just feel the authenticity of it?\\
144 - Not like those crappy plastic national parks\\
145 - you've been going to.\\
146 - You can relax, Francis.\\
147 - I got off the bus already.\\
148 - Right, okay.\\
149 - Here's the deal: we go inside,\\
150 - make a polite appearance for my mother's birthday,\\
151 - have some cake with her, drop off my laundry,\\
152 - and then we go to the party.\\
153 - My God!\\
154 - What?\\
155 - Do you even know\\
156 - how astonishingly beautiful you are?\\
157 - Oh, yes.\\
158 - I've had 15 marriage proposals.\\
159 - That's why the general sent me on this trip--\\
160 - to keep me out of trouble.\\
161 - Hey, boys. Where's Mom?\\
162 - Bedroom.\\
163 - Oh, yeah?\\
164 - Honey?\\
165 - What?\\
166 - Are you okay?\\
167 - Hey.\\
168 - What's wrong?\\
169 - The boys.\\
170 - Ah.\\
171 - Don't let them get to you.\\
172 - They'll be out of the house in ten years.\\
173 - Hey, what did those mean boys do, huh?\\
174 - I gave them $30 to buy me something nice,\\
175 - and they spent it all on themselves.\\
176 - They don't even care that it's my birthday.\\
177 - Oh, well!\\
178 - Those boys are going to hear from me, let me tell you.\\
179 - They are going to get one heck of a talking-to.\\
180 - And th-then I think I'll go for a drive,\\
181 - I'm just so furious.\\
182 - Damn it, damn it, damn it!\\
183 - Her birthday's on the 12th.\\
184 - It can't be the... oh!\\
185 - No, no!\\
186 - I programmed this stupid watch\\
187 - to remind me that...\\
188 - No, no, no, no!\\
189 - You boys are in so much trouble!\\
190 - Help me on this.\\
191 - I can't believe\\
192 - that you could be so thoughtless!\\
193 - We all screwed up really big this time.\\
194 - I have a good mind to use the belt on all three of you!\\
195 - Why are you yelling at us?\\
196 - Sorry isn't good enough, mister.\\
197 - I forgot your mom's birthday!\\
198 - Oh... Oh!\\
199 - What?!\\
200 - What?!\\
201 - What?!\\
202 - Hi, Hal.\\
203 - Craig, what do you want?\\
204 - Well, Lois and I had an exchange, and I felt bad,\\
205 - so... I'm sure she told you all about it.\\
206 - No, actually, she didn't say anything.\\
207 - Craig, we're in the middle of...\\
208 - Well, it's complicated.\\
209 - You see, I didn't buy Lois a present,\\
210 - even though I wanted to, and I thought "this is silly,"\\
211 - so I went ahead and got her one, and here it is.\\
212 - Oh... great.\\
213 - I-I'll take it in to her right now.\\
214 - Oh, such a nice,\\
215 - nice gift.\\
216 - You know what, second thought, uh,\\
217 - I can take care of this tomorrow.\\
218 - I'll bring it in to work. Oh, no, wouldn't be\\
219 - any trouble at all. Really?\\
220 - No, I'd be happy to take it in to her.\\
221 - Yeah, I'd really hate to put you out.\\
222 - Don't be silly.\\
223 - Give it!\\
224 - Lois, it's Craig! He's stealing your present!\\
225 - It's a present that I paid $129 for!\\
226 - Honey?\\
227 - Honey, where are you going?\\
228 - Wherever I want.\\
229 - Well...\\
230 - when are you coming home?\\
231 - When?\\
232 - Whenever somebody in this family gives a damn.\\
233 - Happy birthday, Mom!\\
234 - This is bad.\\
235 - Mom's never taken off on us like this before.\\
236 - Yeah. She usually throws  us  out.\\
237 - You bought candy?\\
238 - You don't just...!\\
239 - It was her...!\\
240 - If I only had the...!\\
241 - Stupid watch!\\
242 - Candy?!\\
243 - What were you...?!\\
244 - D'oh!\\
245 - What's his problem?\\
246 - He's not the only one pissed at you little twerps.\\
247 - What are you talking about?\\
248 - I had this great party lined up\\
249 - with this beautiful girl,\\
250 - and all I had to do was come home,\\
251 - make an appearance at Mom's birthday--\\
252 - be the good son.\\
253 - Everything would've been fine,\\
254 - but now my trip home has been tainted.\\
255 - In her mind, we're all thoughtless jerks,\\
256 - thanks to you guys.\\
257 - What did we do? Think about it.\\
258 - Mom gave you money to buy her a present\\
259 - and you spent most of it on candy.\\
260 - And the rest on her presents.\\
261 - But you spent most of it on candy.\\
262 - We've established that.\\
263 - We're just going around in circles here.\\
264 - Okay, look.\\
265 - How would you feel if Mom didn't buy you a present?\\
266 - Mom's not buying me a birthday present?\\
267 - No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying...\\
268 - But it's my birthday.\\
269 - No, it's not.\\
270 - Francis, it's Mom.\\
271 - We've never made a big deal out of her birthday.\\
272 - And plus, she said she'd be happy with whatever we got her.\\
273 - And was she happy?\\
274 - Oh, man... we suck.\\
275 - Did we make Mom mad?\\
276 - No, Dewey, worse.\\
277 - You hurt her.\\
278 - Okay, I'm lost.\\
279 - Ow!\\
280 - That's how Mom feels on the inside.\\
281 - So what are we supposed to do?\\
282 - "We"?\\
283 - Haven't you guys been listening?\\
284 - You screwed up, not me. I'm not doing anything.\\
285 - I don't know what you're going to do, and I don't care.\\
286 - I have my own problems.\\
287 - I have to go to a kegger, party with my friends,\\
288 - make out with an African goddess with this hanging over my head.\\
289 - Come on, Amaani.\\
290 - This isn't fair.\\
291 - Mom never should have taken us\\
292 - to a store that sells candy.\\
293 - She set us up!\\
294 - Shut up, Reese.\\
295 - We blew it.\\
296 - We made our own mom run away from home.\\
297 - Where do you think she is?\\
298 -     Behind every good woman lies a trail of men    \\
299 -     Don't ask where she's going, don't ask where she's been    \\
300 -     Behind every good woman lies...    \\
301 - Hey, lady, are you going to hog that cage all day?\\
302 - I got news for you, kid. I'm a grown-up\\
303 - with a credit card and no curfew.\\
304 - I could stay here all week if I want.\\
305 - - Yeah, but we want to hit. - Yeah, we do.\\
306 - When you getting out of there?\\
307 - You want me to get out?\\
308 - Okay, I'll get out.\\
309 - If you do one thing for me.\\
310 - You give me back 15 years of my life.\\
311 - Can you do that? Can you reverse time?\\
312 - Can you take me back to when I was 23,\\
313 - so I can stay single, go to music school\\
314 - and become a concert violinist?\\
315 - Huh?\\
316 - No? Okay.\\
317 - Looks like I'm going to have to keep on batting.\\
318 - You can't just hog the cage because you're crazy!\\
319 - That's not fair!\\
320 - You think I'm crazy?\\
321 - I'll show you crazy.\\
322 -        \\
323 - I hope your friend Richie\\
324 - has some place where we can be alone.\\
325 - You know my mom's going to end up blaming me for this.\\
326 - What?\\
327 - This whole birthday fiasco.\\
328 - By the time she's done spinning it in her head,\\
329 - I'll be the one who gave her the crappy presents.\\
330 - Any chance my mom gets to make my life miserable,\\
331 - she pounces.\\
332 - You know, in Mozambique,\\
333 - talking about your mother this much isn't considered a turn-on.\\
334 - Sorry.\\
335 - Is Mom ever coming home?\\
336 - Of course she is.\\
337 - Reese, what are you doing?\\
338 - Making a list of women for Dad to look into.\\
339 - Now that Mom's gone.\\
340 - Mom's coming back.\\
341 - Hey, if you want to be in denial,\\
342 - it's fine with me, but I'm trying to keep Dad\\
343 - from making the same mistake twice.\\
344 - It's called being proactive.\\
345 - "Mrs. Larson"?\\
346 - She can cook, and her daughters are nymphos.\\
347 - Ask me what she did for my birthday?\\
348 - Just ask me.\\
349 - Francis... Okay.\\
350 - I'm sorry.\\
351 - That is the last time.\\
352 - It's out of my mind.\\
353 - And this next track is a special request to Lois from Hal.\\
354 - He loves you and misses you and says if you come back,\\
355 - he'll give you that sweet monkey love...\\
356 - What are you doing? Nothing.\\
357 - And this next song\\
358 - goes out to a very special lady from Craig.\\
359 -        \\
360 - Oh, no.\\
361 - What is it?\\
362 - It's my mom.\\
363 - What's she doing at a batting cage?\\
364 - And why am I surprised by anything she does?\\
365 - Don't worry, I am not going to let her ruin this for us.\\
366 - We are going to that party-- end of story.\\
367 - Damn it!\\
368 - Oh, thank God.\\
369 - She's crushing the ball.\\
370 - How come she didn't teach us how to play baseball?\\
371 - Because there's more to hitting than making contact.\\
372 - So what do we do now?\\
373 -     Happy birthday, dear Timmy    \\
374 -     Happy birthday to you.    \\
375 - Okay, Timmy, blow out the candles.\\
376 - Hang on there, Timmy.\\
377 - What are you doing?\\
378 - Can I talk to you for a second?\\
379 -     Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you    \\
380 -     Happy birthday, dear Lois         Happy birthday, dear Mom    \\
381 -     Happy birthday to you.    \\
382 - Happy birthday, honey.\\
383 - Yeah.\\
384 - What are you doing, Hal?\\
385 - Well, what's it look like?\\
386 - We're celebrating your birthday as a family.\\
387 - Who are you?\\
388 - I'm sorry, Mom.\\
389 - Yeah, me, too. Me, too.\\
390 - Actually, I'd like to point out that I'm clean on this one.\\
391 - Lois, honey, come home, please? What do we have to do?\\
392 - A lot of things.\\
393 - I don't want to be taken for granted anymore.\\
394 - If I come back, you guys are gonna make some changes.\\
395 - Anything, whatever you want.\\
396 - I don't ever want to have to remind\\
397 - my own family that it's my birthday.\\
398 - You are so right.\\
399 - It will never happen again.\\
400 - Mm-hmm. And one night a week,\\
401 - I don't want to have to fix dinner.\\
402 - Absolutely, good, fine, done. No problem.\\
403 - And I want dirty laundry in the hamper,\\
404 - not on the floor, not over a lampshade,\\
405 - not shoved in some mattress crack.\\
406 - No problem. We'll throw it in the hamper.\\
407 - It's just that easy, huh?\\
408 - Yes, it's just that easy.\\
409 - Then why do I even have to ask?\\
410 - If it's so obvious\\
411 - I need a little human consideration,\\
412 - I shouldn't even have to ask.\\
413 - Oh, geez, honey, that's never going to happen.\\
414 - What?\\
415 - We're not smart enough to do that.\\
416 - Look who you're talking to.\\
417 - You might as well ask us all to be a foot taller.\\
418 - Sweetie, you're always going to have to tell us what to do.\\
419 - I mean, look at this half-baked celebration.\\
420 - I mean, we're at the top of our game here.\\
421 - Honey, the only thing that\\
422 - we're ever going to be able\\
423 - to offer you is our total abject obedience.\\
424 - I-I know that doesn't sound like much,\\
425 - but if you look at it this way,\\
426 - our meager abilities are yours completely-- 100%.\\
427 - Listen, wide ride, these guys are\\
428 - just trying to do something nice for you.\\
429 - Give them a break.\\
430 - I-I'm sorry.\\
431 - Did you just call my wife "wide ride"?\\
432 - Oh, okay, I get it.\\
433 - You got to make a big show for...\\
434 - Now, you are going to get up and apolo...\\
435 - All right!\\
436 - Yeah! Good job!\\
437 - Hit him, Dad! Come on!\\
438 - Come on, work the gut!\\
439 - Work the inside! Keep your hands in!\\
440 - Lead with the left!\\
441 - Hold this.\\
442 - I got to go. I know.\\
443 - You'll be here waiting for me when I'm done?\\
444 - No. Good-bye.\\
445 - Hit him, Dad! Kill him!\\
446 - Fight him! Hit him!\\
447 -     All my life was a paper    \\
448 -     Once plain, pure and white    \\
449 -     Till you moved with your pen    \\
450 -     Changing moods now and then    \\
451 -     Till the balance was right    \\
452 -     And you    \\
453 -     Decorated my life    \\
454 -     By painting your love    \\
455 -     All over my heart    \\
456 -     You decorated my life    \\
457 -     Ooh, ooh    \\
458 -     Ooh, ooh.    
\subsection {Episode 04: Dinner Out}
1 - Bottom of the ninth.\\
2 - Two outs, man on first.\\
3 - The windup...\\
4 - The pitch...\\
5 - Uh-oh.\\
6 - Oh, man, we're so dead.\\
7 - That's it. Game over.\\
8 - Yeah.\\
9 - So I win. What?!\\
10 - Past the lamp is a home run.\\
11 - Two men scored.\\
12 - That was a foul ball.\\
13 - Are you crazy?\\
14 - It went right down the line.\\
15 - It was foul. Shut up.\\
16 - You're home plate. You don't get a vote.\\
17 - And it was fair. Do over.\\
18 - Fine by me.\\
19 - Oh, crap!\\
20 - Now we really have to quit.\\
21 - Yeah, but that was a triple.\\
22 - Get back up there.\\
23 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
24 -     I don't know    \\
25 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     And you're not so big    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
32 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
33 -     And you're not so big    \\
34 -     Life is unfair.    \\
35 - The thing about playing\\
36 - at Stevie Kenarban's house is\\
37 - he has every one of my favorite video games\\
38 - from when I was four.\\
39 - End of... the rainbow.\\
40 - I win...\\
41 - the gold.\\
42 - Don't you have something\\
43 - with a little bit more violence in it?\\
44 - Fishing... for Fishies.\\
45 - Sometimes...\\
46 - he drowns.\\
47 - Boys!\\
48 - I've got snacks.\\
49 - Hands.\\
50 - Now... who wants applesauce?\\
51 - I do.\\
52 - Stevie, there is no need to use your outdoor voice.\\
53 - And I've got some cinnamon\\
54 - if you guys are feeling a little crazy.\\
55 - Feeling... crazy?\\
56 - A little.\\
57 - That's my mom.\\
58 - Oh, well, she always honks.\\
59 - Tell her she's welcome to come in anytime.\\
60 - We're not going to bite.\\
61 - It's not personal.\\
62 - I think she just likes honking.\\
63 - Malcolm!\\
64 - Well, you'd better get going.\\
65 - I mean, you don't want to make her mad.\\
66 - She's always mad.\\
67 - Malcolm, I mean it!\\
68 - I have ice cream melting!\\
69 - Here's your... Oh, no, no, no.\\
70 - Eat it in the car.\\
71 - Eat it in the car.\\
72 - Oops.\\
73 - Jerk.\\
74 - You looked.\\
75 - Ow!\\
76 - We're doing this new thing\\
77 - called the circle game.\\
78 - Basically, if you can make the other guy\\
79 - look at your hand while you're doing this...\\
80 - below your waist, you get to hit them in the arm.\\
81 - It's stupid, but, hey-- you get to hit people.\\
82 - Barn door's open.\\
83 - Huh?\\
84 - Aah!\\
85 - Boys.\\
86 - That was Kitty Kenarban.\\
87 - She wants to go out for dinner.\\
88 - That sounds like fun. Good for you, dear.\\
89 - She meant the whole family.\\
90 - Oh.\\
91 - Mom, I don't think\\
92 - that's really a good idea.\\
93 - I mean, the Kenarbans\\
94 - are kind of... well, boring.\\
95 - They're refined, Malcolm,\\
96 - and it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world\\
97 - if some of their manners rubbed off on you boys.\\
98 - I just don't think you guys would get along with them.\\
99 - Don't be silly.\\
100 - I think it's nice she's asking us out to dinner.\\
101 - It's been a long time since anyone invited us anywhere.\\
102 - I wonder why that is.\\
103 - I think I see some hungry seals.\\
104 - Cadets...\\
105 - as you know, I don't often reveal my... personal side,\\
106 - but after 20 years of separation,\\
107 - my mother has agreed to visit with me this weekend.\\
108 - She is a very demanding woman,\\
109 - and I haven't seen her for a long time.\\
110 - I want things to go well.\\
111 - That means I will have no time for antics, shenanigans,\\
112 - hooliganism or tomfoolery.\\
113 - There will be no problems\\
114 - which take me away from time with Mother.\\
115 - This is important to me, which makes it...\\
116 - Important to us.\\
117 - So it is crystal clear.\\
118 - I will not be disturbed this weekend.\\
119 - Yes, sir!\\
120 - As you were.\\
121 - Whoa, he sounds pretty serious.\\
122 - Yeah. What time you want to start the party?\\
123 - Hmm? What are you talking about?\\
124 - Didn't you hear what Spangler just said?\\
125 - All I heard was he's going to be too busy\\
126 - with his mother to pay us any attention.\\
127 - What kind of party did you have in mind?\\
128 - Oh, I don't know.\\
129 - I'm sure I can come up with something\\
130 - that we'll all find amusing.\\
131 - Well, howdy, girls.\\
132 - I couldn't help but notice you all\\
133 - hanging out here by the fence\\
134 - for the last six months.\\
135 - Would you like to come to a party tomorrow night?\\
136 - Wh... you're going to let us come inside?\\
137 - Oh, well, sure, that'd be the neighborly thing to do.\\
138 - I would kill or die to go to your party.\\
139 - Seriously-- kill or die.\\
140 - Well, that's the spirit.\\
141 - Okay, I'll take you\\
142 - and you and you\\
143 - and you.\\
144 - Wait a minute.\\
145 - Isn't this kind of degrading?\\
146 - Okay, not you\\
147 - and you and you...\\
148 - I want to eat that one and that one.\\
149 - Oh, and those two.\\
150 - Isn't this nice?\\
151 - No pirate themes.\\
152 - No ball pits filled with screaming children.\\
153 - Hal, look.\\
154 - "Please wait to be seated."\\
155 - Look, a dollar.\\
156 - Oh, it's mine.\\
157 - Damn. I never fall for that amateur stuff.\\
158 - Now, I am going to say this once and only once.\\
159 - We are with respectable people tonight.\\
160 - You are to be well mannered and act civilized,\\
161 - or so help me, I'll wring your little necks, you hear me?\\
162 - Okay, here's the plan if we want to ditch out of this thing.\\
163 - At the beginning, I'll say that I think\\
164 - I might be coming down with something...\\
165 - Hal, I don't want to ditch out of this.\\
166 - I'm looking forward to it.\\
167 - The Kenarbans are nice people,\\
168 - and they want to be friends with us.\\
169 - So you're-you're saying I'm on my own here.\\
170 - Yoo-hoo, hi there.\\
171 - Hello.\\
172 - Abe.\\
173 - Hal. I think I might\\
174 - be coming down with something.\\
175 - Sorry we're late-- some jackass\\
176 - parked in the handicapped space.\\
177 - Oh, huh, huh.\\
178 - Why don't you guys get seated and I-I...\\
179 - I got to get something out of the car.\\
180 - I'll just be a...\\
181 - Why didn't we think of doing this sooner?\\
182 - Don't you think they're getting a little loud?\\
183 - Spangler's only two buildings over.\\
184 - Uh... ladies.\\
185 - This is all great, but if we could just\\
186 - take it down a teensy bit.\\
187 - Whoo! I marked him, girl!\\
188 - He's mine!\\
189 - Now, remember,\\
190 - no throwing ice.\\
191 - No flicking butter at the ceiling.\\
192 - No sticking gum under the table\\
193 - and no eating gum already stuck under the table.\\
194 - Keep your voices down.\\
195 - You are warned.\\
196 - You look very nice, Stevie.\\
197 - Oh, great.\\
198 - Who spilled?\\
199 - Aw.\\
200 - Ow.\\
201 - Circle game?\\
202 - I want to... play.\\
203 - I don't know, Stevie.\\
204 - It's... it's pretty rough.\\
205 - Oh, come on, quit babying him.\\
206 - If he wants to play, let him play.\\
207 - Now, remember, Stevie, don't look at this...\\
208 - ...uh... or this.\\
209 - He's... good.\\
210 - Well, this is nice.\\
211 - I've been looking forward to this for a long time.\\
212 - I don't know why we didn't do this sooner.\\
213 - Do I feel flush?\\
214 - No.\\
215 - Would anyone like a drink before you order?\\
216 - Oh, yeah.\\
217 - Uh, he'll have a diet soda.\\
218 - And you, sir?\\
219 - Uh...\\
220 - what the heck-- lemonade.\\
221 - I'll have an iced tea.\\
222 - Sorry, we're out.\\
223 - Oh, uh, well, then, I'll have a...\\
224 - Wait a minute-- what's that guy having?\\
225 - That's hot tea.\\
226 - This is ridiculous.\\
227 - You have tea, you have ice.\\
228 - Make her some iced tea.\\
229 - Oh, no, no, no, that is fine.\\
230 - I would love a hot tea.\\
231 - Wow.\\
232 - This is really nice.\\
233 - Well, I have to use the restroom.\\
234 - I think I also need to use the restroom.\\
235 - Girls! You've got to be quiet! Please!\\
236 -     You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals    \\
237 -     So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel!    \\
238 - Way to go, Francis.\\
239 - Hey, I promised you girls-- not quality girls.\\
240 - Wow!\\
241 - Well, gentlemen--\\
242 - I've had enough experience with debacles\\
243 - to know when to cut your losses.\\
244 - It's time to get Spangler.\\
245 - No. Come on, we're not wusses.\\
246 - We can handle this ourselves.\\
247 - I'm going to put a stop to this right now.\\
248 - All right, girls, party's over.\\
249 - Help! Mama!\\
250 - They're seeing my underpants.\\
251 - Help!\\
252 - Nice... one.\\
253 - Stevie, quit the game.\\
254 - You're just getting punched.\\
255 - You haven't gotten us once.\\
256 - Oh, yeah?\\
257 - Then how come...\\
258 - you saw...\\
259 - this?\\
260 - Damn.\\
261 - I swear, Hal, you said, "I feel flushed"\\
262 - five seconds before I was about to. Oh, yeah?\\
263 - Salud.\\
264 - Look at us now-- two grown men\\
265 - having to sneak off from their wives just to have a drink.\\
266 - How sad. Nah, no, no.\\
267 - It's really not like that with me and Kitty.\\
268 - Sure, I might let her think she's in charge,\\
269 - but when it comes down to the important stuff,\\
270 - Daddy rules the roost.\\
271 - Oh, hi, Kitty.\\
272 - I got you!\\
273 - I did.\\
274 - To being whipped.\\
275 - Like butter, my friend.\\
276 - Kitty.\\
277 - Where are those guys?\\
278 - Hal probably dragged Abe over to the bar.\\
279 - You know, if he's drunk, so help me...\\
280 - Oh, no-no-no. It's okay.\\
281 - Gives us a chance to talk.\\
282 - Here we are-- diet soda...\\
283 - lemonade...\\
284 - and cranberry juice.\\
285 - Thank you. Cranberry juice?\\
286 - After all that static he gave you about ordering tea,\\
287 - he gives you cranberry juice?\\
288 - Excuse me? No-no-no,\\
289 - it's fine.\\
290 - Something wrong?\\
291 - Yes. My friend ordered tea\\
292 - and you've brought her cranberry juice.\\
293 - I don't think so.\\
294 - Instead of arguing with me, why don't you\\
295 - just march back to the kitchen and make...\\
296 - No-no-no. I like cranberry juice.\\
297 - Very healthy for you. Mmm...\\
298 - Hey, Reese, that's enough!\\
299 - This isn't funny anymore.\\
300 - Okay, okay.\\
301 - Man, look what your shoulders did\\
302 - to my knuckles.\\
303 - I'll get you when I come back.\\
304 - I even knew...\\
305 - he was going...\\
306 - to do that.\\
307 - She won't let me\\
308 - have butter on my bread--  butter.\\
309 - I haven't eaten the stuff in ten years.\\
310 - How'd this happen?\\
311 - We weren't always this way.\\
312 - Actually, I was.\\
313 - Classic story--\\
314 - raised by a grandmother and four spinster aunts.\\
315 - I used to wash their hair on Saturday nights.\\
316 - You poor bastard, you never had a chance.\\
317 - Damn it... enough is enough!\\
318 - You go, Abe!\\
319 - Go! Go! Go!\\
320 - Sir?\\
321 - Go away!\\
322 - I told you I did not want to be disturbed.\\
323 - My aunt and I are... catching up.\\
324 - I... I thought you said it was your mother, sir.\\
325 - Go away!\\
326 - I wish I could, sir,\\
327 - but we have a bit of a situation.\\
328 - See, we decided to have this party\\
329 - and it kind of got out of hand...\\
330 - I don't care, cadet.\\
331 - I will deal with it in the morning. Yeah, but...\\
332 - In the morning!\\
333 - It's just that we invited some of the local girls...\\
334 - Local girls?!\\
335 - There are local girls inside the perimeter?\\
336 - Have they killed anyone?\\
337 - N-No, sir,\\
338 - but I saw one of them eat a raw chicken whole.\\
339 - Spangy. Uh... just a minute... Mother.\\
340 - Do you have any idea what you have done?\\
341 - Marlin Academy cannot exist\\
342 - without the support, the goodwill and cooperation\\
343 - of the local community.\\
344 - The police chief and the mayor\\
345 - both sit on our board of governors!\\
346 - The fire chief is a regent!\\
347 - And right now their psychotic offspring are in there\\
348 - tearing up the floorboards!\\
349 - It won't be long before they're in the air ducts.\\
350 - What are we going to do, sir?\\
351 - We are going to do what any self-respecting member of society does\\
352 - in a situation like this-- we're going to keep it quiet.\\
353 - But they're destroying the school.\\
354 - Let's hope that's all they do, cadet.\\
355 - I'm afraid this is like an oil fire--\\
356 - we have to let it burn itself out.\\
357 - Oh, yeah, I forgot-- one of them started an oil fire.\\
358 - So...\\
359 - did you see any good movies lately?\\
360 - Well, we just saw Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.\\
361 - Did you see it?\\
362 - No.\\
363 - Last movie I saw was\\
364 - The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes on cable.\\
365 - Oh, my God! Kurt Russell! Yes.\\
366 - Oh, I had such a crush on him in those Disney films.\\
367 - I did, too-- especially in  Now You See It...\\
368 - Now You Don't!\\
369 - Oh, God... Oh, he was so cute.\\
370 - Did you see  The Strongest Man in the World? About 50 times.\\
371 - Oh, my God! I just wanted to reach out and grab that tush.\\
372 - I am so terrible.\\
373 - Seriously, this has got to stop.\\
374 - I'm actually starting to feel bad\\
375 - and plus... I'm kind of getting bored creatively.\\
376 - Oh, my God!\\
377 - Is that a snake? Stevie, don't.\\
378 - Sucker.\\
379 - Snake...\\
380 - I'm an idiot.\\
381 - Oh... Oh...\\
382 - I'm so glad we decided to have this dinner.\\
383 - So am I. I feel so much better now.\\
384 - Better?\\
385 - About you and your family.\\
386 - What?\\
387 - A-A-About Malcolm and Stevie\\
388 - because they spend so much time together,\\
389 - and now that we've gotten to know each other,\\
390 - I just feel better.\\
391 - Wait a minute.\\
392 - You mean this wasn't about you wanting to be friends?\\
393 - Yes, it was.\\
394 - No, it wasn't.\\
395 - You were checking us out.\\
396 - You wanted to see if we were good enough for your family.\\
397 - No, no, no. I-I wouldn't put it that way.\\
398 - I would, because that's what you're doing.\\
399 - How dare you!\\
400 - You can't judge us.\\
401 - You know,\\
402 - you are not so perfect yourself, lady.\\
403 - Hell, you are one of the most uptight, repressed people\\
404 - I've ever met in my life.\\
405 - Did you know that Kurt Russell was the jungle boy\\
406 - on  Gilligan's Island?\\
407 - Don't change the subject.\\
408 - We're having an argument here.\\
409 - I yell at you; you yell at me--\\
410 - that's what you do.\\
411 - What's wrong with you?\\
412 - Whatever you say is wrong with me\\
413 - is what's wrong with me.\\
414 - There-- problem solved.\\
415 - Okay, that's just freaky.\\
416 - Hey, I'm getting good with my left.\\
417 - Thanks, Stevie.\\
418 - I... give up.\\
419 - I'm going to...\\
420 - the car.\\
421 - Way to go, Reese.\\
422 - Aw, geez!\\
423 - Crying on... command...\\
424 - got me... a cable modem.\\
425 - You have a real problem.\\
426 - Have you never yelled at anyone\\
427 - in your entire life?\\
428 - I just don't see what it accomplishes.\\
429 - Are you kidding?\\
430 - Most of the time, if you're not yelling,\\
431 - they're not listening.\\
432 - Lois, our situation is difficult enough\\
433 - without me adding a bunch of negativity to it.\\
434 - What situation? You mean Stevie?\\
435 - He's fine! He's not going to wither away\\
436 - because you blow off steam every once in a while.\\
437 - Hey, why don't you give both of you a break?\\
438 - Go ahead, hit me.\\
439 - Get it over with.\\
440 - Ow... ow...\\
441 - Let me... help you.\\
442 - Reap...\\
443 - the whirlwind!\\
444 - Finally-- justice.\\
445 - I mean, if he doesn't kill him.\\
446 - Stevie, what the hell do you think you're doing?!\\
447 - You are in so much trouble!\\
448 - This behavior is totally unacceptable.\\
449 - We are at a restaurant-- what is wrong with you?\\
450 - Don't you take that tone with me!\\
451 - You just wait till we get home!\\
452 - He bruised the bone.\\
453 - Oh, like you didn't deserve it.\\
454 - Good for you! I knew you had it in you.\\
455 - Shut your trap!\\
456 - Excuse me, would you mind please keeping it down?\\
457 - Would you mind going to hell?\\
458 - And I absolutely did order tea!\\
459 - How hard is it to remember a stupid drink order, you idiot?\\
460 - Kitty, there's going to be some changes...\\
461 - And you-- Mr. Ho Hos in his sock drawer!\\
462 - Who do you think you're kidding?\\
463 - Honey, you have to pace yourself.\\
464 - And another thing, Don Juan,\\
465 - there are two people in that bed!\\
466 - You know, I really don't feel very good.\\
467 - And I had it with your poker nights and your idiot frien...\\
468 - I think this is where they nested.\\
469 - I'd say we got off lucky.\\
470 - This happened once before in '72--\\
471 - we had to bulldoze the amphitheater.\\
472 - It's Horton.\\
473 - Hey, Horton, you okay?\\
474 - What happened?\\
475 - I've seen things, Francis...\\
476 - terrible things...\\
477 - and I... I think I'm engaged.\\
478 - Come on, children, quickly, quickly. Those pants went\\
479 - out of style in the '80s and they were ugly back then.\\
480 - Don't you give me that look.\\
481 - You got a eye problem?\\
482 - Whoa. Interesting dinner.\\
483 - Stevie beat the crap out of Reese,\\
484 - his dad got drunk,\\
485 - and his mom's gone totally psycho.\\
486 - Oh, my God... we're contagious.\\
487 - ...the whole night staring at the cocktail waitress.
\subsection {Episode 05: Casino}
1 - What? Can't sleep?\\
2 - No, I have this terrible feeling we've forgotten something.\\
3 - Trash, locks, lights...\\
4 - Oh, well, whatever it is,\\
5 - I'm sure it can wait till morning.\\
6 - Oh, boy.\\
7 - All right, son.\\
8 - Son, I think you've learned your lesson.\\
9 - Okay.\\
10 - Thanks, Dad.\\
11 - We've got to stop doing this.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Craig's dropping off my paycheck,\\
25 - so I asked him to bring in the mail.\\
26 - I didn't think I needed to cancel the Sunday paper.\\
27 - Somebody's just going to steal it anyway.\\
28 - Sounds like we've got nothing to worry about\\
29 - for the next two days but having fun.\\
30 - Mom, Dewey's going to puke.\\
31 - Geez, he's thrown up four times.\\
32 - You'd think he'd be empty by now.\\
33 - We're almost there, honey.\\
34 - Just keep your head in the bucket.\\
35 - Just ten more minutes,\\
36 - and we'll get to spend a weekend\\
37 - on a real Indian reservation.\\
38 - Why do they have casinos?\\
39 - I don't know, son.\\
40 - Let's just thank God they do.\\
41 - Hey, the pool at this place looks pretty good.\\
42 - You guys are going to have a nice time.\\
43 - It's too bad Francis couldn't be here.\\
44 - Oh, don't you feel bad for Francis.\\
45 - He's the one who got himself on academic probation.\\
46 - Francis isn't going anywhere this weekend.\\
47 - Richie, it's me.\\
48 - I ditched school,\\
49 - my family's away for the whole weekend,\\
50 - so I got the house to myself.\\
51 - Call Circus and Justin, 'cause we're going to party!\\
52 - Sorry, dude. They're in jail.\\
53 - You're kidding. Why?\\
54 - They got caught trying to steal\\
55 - the giant inflatable panda from the car lot.\\
56 - Oh, man!\\
57 - That would've been great to have.\\
58 - Well, you can come over, right?\\
59 - I'm not sure.\\
60 - This weekend's my intervention.\\
61 - How long you think this is going to take, Mom?\\
62 - You'd better put me down as a "maybe."\\
63 - Oh, man, did I overbuy on pork rinds.\\
64 - Oop!\\
65 - Oh, hey, here we go. This is nice.\\
66 - I get the rollaway.\\
67 - I want to sleep with Malcolm.\\
68 - Cool. I get the big bed for myself.\\
69 - Not fair. If you get the big bed, you get Dewey.\\
70 - That's not the way you called it, butt-head.\\
71 - Now, boys, I'm sure we can find a fair way\\
72 - to figure this out.\\
73 - Reese, Malcolm, Dewey.\\
74 - I'm taking a bath.\\
75 - Anybody's got to go, it's now or never.\\
76 - Can we go swimming, Mom? Yeah, can we?\\
77 - I think I might take a quick look at the casino.\\
78 - Hal, you got two days to gamble.\\
79 - Why don't you take the boys to the pool bef...?\\
80 - Hal?\\
81 - They don't do anything.\\
82 - They're just there.\\
83 - Hold it there, boys. No one under 16\\
84 - allowed in the pool without an adult.\\
85 - It's okay. They're with me.\\
86 - Sorry. No parent, no pool.\\
87 - But that's ridiculous!\\
88 - We all know how to swim.\\
89 - Okay, fine.\\
90 - We'll just go get my dad in the casino.\\
91 - Sorry. No kids allowed in the casino either.\\
92 - I'm not going to gamble. I just want to get my dad.\\
93 - Look, I don't make the rules.\\
94 - You're just doing this because you hate kids.\\
95 - I'm really not. It's just a happy coincidence.\\
96 - Mom, they won't let us in the pool without an adult.\\
97 - What are we supposed to do?\\
98 - I don't know. Use your imaginations.\\
99 - What? We're on vacation.\\
100 - Hey, there's dirt out there, isn't there?\\
101 - And rocks and lizards.\\
102 - And I think I saw an old tire in the parking lot.\\
103 - There are kids in the world\\
104 - with a lot less than an old tire to play with,\\
105 - so I don't want to hear another word about it!\\
106 - Yeah, it's great being home.\\
107 - So catch me up. What's going on?\\
108 - Well, we had Salisbury steak for dinner.\\
109 - Yeah? With creamed spinach?\\
110 - Uh-huh.\\
111 - That's a great side dish.\\
112 - Now, I know they use celery salt\\
113 - and vinegar with that,\\
114 - but is that oregano I taste, or is that tarragon?\\
115 - Francis, I... I got to go.\\
116 - All right, fine. Put Finley on.\\
117 - You already talked to him twice.\\
118 - Come on, we're playing pool and I'm up.\\
119 - Okay, okay, play your stupid game.\\
120 - I got some serious partying to do here anyway.\\
121 - Whoo!\\
122 - Yes! I win again!\\
123 - No fair. My goalie doesn't have any legs.\\
124 - Hey, boys.\\
125 - Hey, Dad. How'd you do?\\
126 - Well, you know, blackjack's a complicated game.\\
127 - You have your ups and your downs.\\
128 - So, who wants to buy me a Coke?\\
129 - It's too bad you had to quit, Dad.\\
130 - That shoe is full of tens.\\
131 - Huh?\\
132 - Tens. Face cards.\\
133 - Okay, there's six decks.\\
134 - They already played out 18 nines,\\
135 - 14 eights, 12 sevens, but only two tens--\\
136 - a king of spades and a queen of diamonds.\\
137 - Which leaves... well, you can do the math.\\
138 - No, but you can, and that's all that matters!\\
139 - Oh, my little genius!\\
140 -        \\
141 - Of course we're terribly sorry about this.\\
142 - You have to believe that this is\\
143 - a momentary lack of judgment\\
144 - on my part.\\
145 - See, I-I realize now that using my son...\\
146 - Your underage son.\\
147 - Yeah, my-my underage son, uh...\\
148 - to count cards was wrong.\\
149 - I guess I was just trying to look for an activity\\
150 - that the two of us can enjoy doing together.\\
151 - You know, it's a tough age.\\
152 - Yeah, a-and this was really helping my self-esteem.\\
153 - You see, I'm not really good at sports,\\
154 - and this made me feel... special.\\
155 - My son and I cook.\\
156 - Huh. That's a good thought.\\
157 - We'll have to try that.\\
158 - In the meantime,\\
159 - you're banned from the casino.\\
160 - Banned?\\
161 - Oh, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.\\
162 - You see, that... that's just not\\
163 - going to go over so well with my wife.\\
164 - And believe me, you don't want to see her angry.\\
165 - I'm not banning her. Just you.\\
166 - Okay, uh, look, let's just, uh...\\
167 - forget about the three grand that I... I won, hmm?\\
168 - Just pretend it never happened?\\
169 - Capisce?\\
170 - That's very generous of you.\\
171 - You're still banned.\\
172 - What?!\\
173 - Oh, all right, then.\\
174 - Just give me my money back.\\
175 - I'm sorry.\\
176 - What money?\\
177 - Hey, look, pal...\\
178 - Who said anything about money?\\
179 - Thank you.\\
180 - I tell you, I am not that impressed with this place.\\
181 - You call that a breakfast buffet?\\
182 - Not a tangelo to be found.\\
183 - What are you talking about?\\
184 - Didn't you see that teepee made entirely of sausage?\\
185 - It was incredible!\\
186 - I am going to die.\\
187 - Why didn't anyone stop me?\\
188 - In our family, we take the phrase\\
189 - "all you can eat" as a personal challenge.\\
190 - I know what'll cheer you up.\\
191 - Why don't we go gamble a little?\\
192 - Ooh, uh, now?\\
193 - Where does it say that just because\\
194 - you're at a casino you have to gamble?\\
195 - I mean, I-I'd rather spend some more time with my boys, huh?\\
196 - Whoa, stop it, Dad. Please stop.\\
197 - Hal, you made me sit for eight hours in that car,\\
198 - listening to your foolproof system for winning at keno.\\
199 - Now you're telling me you don't want to gamble?\\
200 - We are surrounded by the great outdoors, Lois.\\
201 - I was thinking we might all go for a hike.\\
202 - Okay, what have you done?\\
203 - What do you mean?\\
204 - Why are you avoiding the casino?\\
205 - Well, sweetheart, we could sit here\\
206 - and I could tell you all about it\\
207 - and you might find it all very amusing,\\
208 - or you could think about the fact\\
209 - that I'm offering to take the boys off your hands\\
210 - for the whole day.\\
211 - Don't forget the sunblock.\\
212 - All right, crew.\\
213 - I just happened to find a brochure in the lobby\\
214 - for the old El Diablo Ghost Town\\
215 - just a five-mile hike from here.\\
216 - What's a ghost town?\\
217 - What do you think it is?\\
218 - It's a town full of dead people.\\
219 - Why can't we just go swimming?\\
220 - Ah, we can swim at home. Where?\\
221 - Come on, it'll be fun.\\
222 - Look, they have a real working old-timey ice cream parlor.\\
223 - We're going!\\
224 -        \\
225 - What are you doing here?\\
226 - Shouldn't you be in military school?\\
227 - Shouldn't you not be in my father's robe?\\
228 - That is neither here nor there.\\
229 - You are in big trouble, my friend.\\
230 - I'm  in trouble?\\
231 - Yes, big trouble.\\
232 - I'm telling your mother.\\
233 - No...  I'm  telling my mother!\\
234 - That's my toast.\\
235 - We'll split it.\\
236 - Huh. I don't get it.\\
237 - The map says the ghost towns are only a half-inch away.\\
238 - Dad, we're lost.\\
239 - What sounds more idiotic:\\
240 - "Let's go to the desert, kids" or "Good idea, Dad"?\\
241 - Hi, Mom!\\
242 - Dewey, what are you doing here?\\
243 - I thought you went for a hike with your father.\\
244 - I couldn't. I don't like ghosts.\\
245 - They eat little boys.\\
246 - That's ridiculous.\\
247 - There's no such thing as ghosts.\\
248 - Except for that one that'll get you if you go up on the roof.\\
249 - Come on, you're too young to be in a casino.\\
250 - Come on, folks, take a spin at the wheel.\\
251 - Oh, may as well try my free spin.\\
252 - That's right, lady. Nobody goes home a loser.\\
253 - Oh, God, I'm ruined!\\
254 - Okay, let's give it a whirl.\\
255 - Well, look at that.\\
256 - You have won our Champagne Dreams Package for two.\\
257 - An entire day of his and her spa treatments\\
258 - followed by an evening of dinner and dancing.\\
259 - Well, that's just perfect.\\
260 - My husband's out on a hike, and we're leaving tomorrow.\\
261 - Relax, lady. It's good for six months.\\
262 - Six months?!\\
263 - I had to work six months of overtime\\
264 - in a crummy drugstore just to pay for this trip.\\
265 - Have you ever had to recommend hemorrhoid cream\\
266 - to a complete stranger?\\
267 - Do you want the prize, or not?\\
268 - You carry a lot of tension in your shoulders.\\
269 - Tell me about it.\\
270 - All right, now, listen. Come on.\\
271 - Let's just all get our bearings here, shall we?\\
272 - All right, here's the sun.\\
273 - What's it telling us?\\
274 - That it's hot.\\
275 - Hey, is that a fence over there?\\
276 - By God, you're right!\\
277 - See, I told you we weren't lost.\\
278 - Then where are we?\\
279 - By the fence.\\
280 - It's a sure sign of civilization.\\
281 - I say we go in.\\
282 - Come on, come on.\\
283 - Wait a minute.\\
284 - What if we're already in,\\
285 - and instead of going in, we're actually going out?\\
286 - Son, sometimes the genius thing gets a little annoying.\\
287 - Come on. Let's just keep thinking positive thoughts.\\
288 - Listen to that.\\
289 - That's a plane.\\
290 - There. Help! Help!\\
291 - Here, we need help!\\
292 - Oh, we're lost!\\
293 - Oh, for the love of God, help us!\\
294 - Well, shall we?\\
295 - I can't believe this.\\
296 - I buy my own bus ticket home,\\
297 - I have to spend the whole weekend with you.\\
298 - I hear you.\\
299 - It's a shame you had to spend your own money.\\
300 - I've discovered a way you can travel for free\\
301 - through the Internet.\\
302 - What, you hack into an airline's reservation system?\\
303 - No, that's illegal.\\
304 - I go into a chat room and pretend to be\\
305 - a really hot 18-year-old girl.\\
306 - I'm Debbie.\\
307 - I'm blond, naive, and I love to wear sundresses.\\
308 - Right now, I'm having a lot of problems at home.\\
309 - Dad's so mean.\\
310 - I'm going through all these changes,\\
311 - all these strange new feelings, he just doesn't understand...\\
312 - Wait, Craig.\\
313 - The free travel?\\
314 - Right.\\
315 - Debbie goes into some chat room,\\
316 - gets real friendly with some lonely guy,\\
317 - and before long he's willing to pay for a visit.\\
318 - Right now, I'm sitting on a ticket to Tampa.\\
319 - Oh, and I make sure he buys Debbie full fare coach,\\
320 - no restrictions.\\
321 - She may look good in a thong, but she's no dummy.\\
322 - Sweet.\\
323 - I'm thirsty.\\
324 - Yeah, well, we'd have water if some idiot\\
325 - hadn't used it to write an S.O.S. in the sand.\\
326 - Oh, I see. You people let me carry the water,\\
327 - and all of a sudden I'm the idiot?\\
328 - Malcolm, Reese, relax.\\
329 - We have nothing to worry about.\\
330 - Everything's going to be fine.\\
331 - Now, I want you to know that I love you boys very much.\\
332 - He keeps saying that.\\
333 - Oh, great.\\
334 - Now I'm hallucinating. I see a cougar.\\
335 - Don't be stupid.\\
336 - That's a puma.\\
337 - Okay, everybody okay?\\
338 - Yeah, I guess so.\\
339 - Oh, my God. Where's Dewey?\\
340 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\\
341 - He's back at the hotel.\\
342 - Okay, then.\\
343 - Nobody's hurt, everything's fine.\\
344 - Dad, a cougar just blew up.\\
345 - I meant besides that.\\
346 - That's not good.\\
347 - Cougars don't just blow up.\\
348 - As near as I can figure, I did it with my mind.\\
349 - Reese, that's insane!\\
350 - I wouldn't talk to me like that if I were you.\\
351 - Okay, there must be some explanation.\\
352 - Okay, it could have been caused\\
353 - by a blasting cap left by a miner,\\
354 - although the explosion was much too big.\\
355 - Perhaps the cougar ate some dynamite.\\
356 - That's ridiculous.\\
357 - Maybe it's just a mirage.\\
358 - Could have been a mirage, although a mirage\\
359 - usually doesn't end up all over your shoes,\\
360 - which leads me back to the Reese thing.\\
361 - I accept your apology.\\
362 - Oh, this feels so good.\\
363 - I mean, you read about celebrities going to spas\\
364 - and having these kinds of treatments,\\
365 - but you marry young, you start spitting out kids,\\
366 - you can kiss this kind of thing good-bye.\\
367 - Don't eat the cucumber slices, honey.\\
368 - Okay.\\
369 - M-Z-R-Y-C.\\
370 - Nice try. What's that supposed to mean?\\
371 - "Mzryc"-- it's another military term.\\
372 - You know, the helmets that horses wear.\\
373 - Oh, right, right, right.\\
374 - This is nice.\\
375 - Hanging out on a Saturday, playing Scrabble.\\
376 - Couple of guys, relaxing.\\
377 - So, your folks getting along okay?\\
378 - What? Nothing.\\
379 - Here we go.\\
380 - Read it and weep.\\
381 - C-A-T.\\
382 - Hey, that's two "cats" for you, that's great.\\
383 - Just playing the tiles I'm dealt.\\
384 - So, uh, you pick up any bad vibes\\
385 - here on the home front, you let me know, right?\\
386 - Why?\\
387 - Hey! Take it easy, cowboy.\\
388 - Just making small talk.\\
389 - Okay.\\
390 - I guess they're doing fine.\\
391 - She's a strong little lady, that mother of yours.\\
392 - Sure, we have our moments at work,\\
393 - but you can't stay mad at that woman for long.\\
394 - You don't have to live with her.\\
395 - Maybe you just don't understand her.\\
396 - What's to understand?\\
397 - She's a total control freak.\\
398 - Maybe she doesn't get the support she needs here at home.\\
399 - Well, I wouldn't know, since she sent me to military school.\\
400 - Because you're a spoiled brat!\\
401 - And I'm pretty sure "Mzyrc" ends in a "K"!\\
402 - Look, it's a house!\\
403 - Yes! All right!\\
404 - Come on.\\
405 - Hello! Hello!\\
406 - They're sitting at the table.\\
407 - They're just ignoring us.\\
408 - They probably think we're trying to sell them something.\\
409 - Hey, we're lost!\\
410 - A cougar exploded!\\
411 - Can we use your phone?\\
412 - Sorry, we hate to barge in,\\
413 - but this is kind of an emergency...\\
414 - Well, this is a little weird.\\
415 - Okay, I just figured this out.\\
416 - Run!\\
417 - We're on an artillery range!\\
418 - That's why the cougar blew up!\\
419 - It was hit by a shell!\\
420 - Are you sure?\\
421 - Pretty sure.\\
422 - Wait!\\
423 - No! Oh!\\
424 - Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out!\\
425 - Go, go, go, go!\\
426 - Of course, we're terribly sorry about this,\\
427 - and we realize that fences are there for a reason.\\
428 - However, in fairness, when we climbed the fence,\\
429 - we weren't sure if we were going in or out.\\
430 - You want to explain the theory, son?\\
431 - Not really.\\
432 - This is a highly classified testing ground,\\
433 - and I could very easily detain the three of you, indefinitely,\\
434 - for national security reasons.\\
435 - Know what nobody's mentioned?\\
436 - Is that this is supposed to be the greatest army in the world,\\
437 - and you couldn't even kill the three of us.\\
438 - I've got to tell you, I'm not impressed.\\
439 - Well, the great thing about this trip is\\
440 - the next time I hear we can't afford to go on vacation,\\
441 - I think I'll be okay with it.\\
442 - I trust everything went well\\
443 - for you and your handsome gentleman friend?\\
444 - He is handsome, isn't he?\\
445 - Can I have some ice cream?\\
446 - You can have anything you want.\\
447 - Tonight is our special night.\\
448 - Hello?\\
449 - Dewey?\\
450 - Oh, thank God.\\
451 - Look, I only get to make one call,\\
452 - so put your mother on so she can come get us.\\
453 - Who was that?\\
454 - Wrong number.\\
455 - Announcing the arrival of\\
456 - Air Alabama Flight 63 at Gate 11.\\
457 - Thank you.\\
458 - My foot is killing me.\\
459 - Ah, let's be brave soldiers, boys.\\
460 - Might get there after dark, but we've got plenty of water,\\
461 - and we'll be okay.\\
462 - Tell us the story again, Dad, please?\\
463 - Yeah, yeah.\\
464 - All right, one last time.\\
465 - Dewey is tied to a post in the burning sun.\\
466 - He's covered entirely in honey.\\
467 - Even his eyes?\\
468 - Even his eyes.\\
469 - Uh-oh, what's that behind him?\\
470 - A million fire ants, hungry fire ants\\
471 - with sharp little mandibles and itchy feet.
\subsection {Episode 06: Convention}
1 - Hey, is his stick bigger than my stick?\\
2 - I don't know. They're just sticks.\\
3 - Yeah,\\
4 - but why does he get the better stick?\\
5 - I always get the crappy sticks.\\
6 - Why is everything of mine so lame?\\
7 - I never have anything nice.\\
8 - My life sucks!\\
9 - Give me that.\\
10 - Sometimes things just have a way of working out.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - I don't see why we need a babysitter.\\
24 - Yeah. Dad's convention is only for two days.\\
25 - How can you not trust us?\\
26 - Well, it's still not fair.\\
27 - I trust you to be on your own.\\
28 - Babysitter's not going to be here for two hours.\\
29 - Don't do anything.\\
30 - Honey, let's roll.\\
31 - The meet-and-greet's at 6:30, and I don't want to be late.\\
32 - Bye-bye.\\
33 - See what happens?\\
34 - We told her we didn't want a babysitter,\\
35 - and she didn't listen.\\
36 - Now someone innocent has to suffer.\\
37 - What's that?\\
38 - It's the cesspool.\\
39 - We have a pool? It's the sewage from the house.\\
40 - It flows into this pit and is decomposed\\
41 - by anaerobic bacteria.\\
42 - Hurry up. It stinks.\\
43 - Nice.\\
44 - Come on, she's going to be here any second.\\
45 - Sorry. I had to put the "lemonade"\\
46 - in the refrigerator.\\
47 - Maybe we scared her off.\\
48 -        \\
49 - Hi, guys. I'm Patty.\\
50 - I'm your babysitter.\\
51 - Uh... will you excuse us for a second?\\
52 - Gee, I sure hope Barbara and Tom can make it this year.\\
53 - They are such a fun couple.\\
54 - Well, I'm sure Jack Keneally will be there.\\
55 - Oh, honey, why don't you just say something to him\\
56 - instead of stewing about it?\\
57 - I mean, talking to me is not going to solve anything,\\
58 - and it's obviously just eating away at you.\\
59 - I'm over that.\\
60 - No, you are not.\\
61 - It's all you ever talk about whenever we go to this thing--\\
62 - how Keneally stole your idea\\
63 - to improve efficiency by four percent on the R8-698.\\
64 - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\
65 - Honey, you're obsessed.\\
66 - I am not obsessed.\\
67 - I just hate that smug look that he always gives me.\\
68 - And those beady little eyes.\\
69 - I ever tell you the story about\\
70 - how he finagled his parking spot?\\
71 - Yeah, about a thousand times, but it doesn't matter\\
72 - because I'm sure you're going to tell me again.\\
73 - Okay, first, he was assigned a space in "C" lot, all right?\\
74 - But that wasn't good enough for him.\\
75 - Not for Keneally! No...\\
76 - So, what do you guys want for a snack?\\
77 - Excuse me?\\
78 - Well, I can make you popcorn\\
79 - or bake us some chocolate chip cookies.\\
80 - But Mom says the oven doesn't work.\\
81 - You guys are just so cute!\\
82 - Hello.\\
83 - Malcolm, how's it going?\\
84 - Listen, I need you to do me a favor.\\
85 - There's 200 or 300 fake I.D.s\\
86 - hidden behind the washing machine.\\
87 - Now, with Mom gone,\\
88 - it's safe to transfer them to the garage.\\
89 - Francis, I really can't do that right now.\\
90 - What? What are you talking about?\\
91 - Francis? Is that Francis?\\
92 - Tell him it's Patty Henderson from eighth grade algebra.\\
93 - Patty Henderson says hi.\\
94 - Oh, my God!\\
95 - Patty Henderson is your babysitter?\\
96 - Here, let me talk to him.\\
97 - Don't let her...\\
98 - Hi.\\
99 - Hi, Patty.\\
100 - Can't believe I'm talking to you.\\
101 - You probably don't even remember me.\\
102 - Hi, Francis.\\
103 - Hi, Patty.\\
104 - Yeah, of course I remember you.\\
105 - How's it...? What's that, Joe?\\
106 - You got to use the phone?\\
107 - I'm sorry, Patty. I got to go. Bye.\\
108 - Francis is so great.\\
109 - He was the only boy who was ever nice to me.\\
110 - Come on, guys, she's not that fat.\\
111 - What a sweetheart.\\
112 - And so cute.\\
113 - Yeah. I'm a lot like him.\\
114 - Tell you what. Before dinner, why don't we all\\
115 - straighten up the house together?\\
116 - Good idea! Sure!\\
117 - Great!\\
118 - Look. I think they're giving away free beach towels\\
119 - - at the QVHLPPS booth. - Yoo-hoo!\\
120 - Hey, there's Barbara and Tom.\\
121 - And there's Keneally.\\
122 - Oh, for God's sake, Hal.\\
123 - You've got to get over this.\\
124 - Just go over there and talk to him.\\
125 - Just clear the air.\\
126 - Okay, okay. Going.\\
127 - What do you do when you've got an incredible woman\\
128 - in your bedroom?\\
129 - En... chan... te.\\
130 - It's the best I could come up with\\
131 - given the parameters.\\
132 - Well, it's great meeting you guys.\\
133 - Would you like anything?\\
134 - They're fine.\\
135 - Okay. Well, have fun.\\
136 - She's a trophy babysitter.\\
137 - Tuck me... in.\\
138 - I wonder if she knows how to keep kosher.\\
139 - What is wrong with you?\\
140 - How can you do this?\\
141 - What are you talking about?\\
142 - You invited them over here to gawk at Patty\\
143 - like she's some piece of meat?\\
144 - Mom and Dad paid good money for her.\\
145 - She's ours! We're leaving.\\
146 - He's not going to do anything with her in the house.\\
147 - Wow! She's like kryptonite.\\
148 - So... this is Reesie's blankie?\\
149 - It's darling.\\
150 - I guess suddenly there's no such thing as tomorrow.\\
151 - All I have are singles. Just...\\
152 - I always felt so sorry for Patty.\\
153 - And she had this wild crush on me.\\
154 - She used to follow me around, waddling,\\
155 - her big arms jiggling.\\
156 - I mean, she was nice--\\
157 - I didn't want to hurt her feelings--\\
158 - but what are you supposed to do\\
159 - when somebody really gross thinks you're cute?\\
160 - You really got a couple of good shots in.\\
161 - Look, I'm just embarrassed about the whole thing.\\
162 - Hey, he stole your idea.\\
163 - How often do you come up with an idea\\
164 - to increase efficiency by four percent?\\
165 - At least you made him scream like a girl.\\
166 - No, that was me.\\
167 - I don't know what got into Hal.\\
168 - I've never seen him act that way before.\\
169 - At least, not without any provocation.\\
170 - Or with witnesses.\\
171 - Men are animals.\\
172 - Or so I am told.\\
173 - Are you drunk already?\\
174 - I'm not wasting any time.\\
175 - I got to get back to the kids in 24 hours.\\
176 - Lord, what an idiot I am.\\
177 - I mean, these are people I work with.\\
178 - They're going to think I'm a lunatic.\\
179 - I should apologize to Keneally.\\
180 - Did you know that\\
181 - you can audition male strippers\\
182 - and you don't even have to hire them?\\
183 - They're not that bright.\\
184 - Oh, I was just going to get T-shirts for the boys, but...\\
185 - That is enough!\\
186 - Let go of his hair!\\
187 - Hal, stop biting!\\
188 - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
189 - Oh, for God's sake, Tom, do something.\\
190 - I'll refill your drink.\\
191 - Okay.\\
192 - What?\\
193 - What are you doing?\\
194 - What are you doing?\\
195 - Here you go.\\
196 - Hungry?\\
197 - I don't know what I am.\\
198 - Dewey!\\
199 - Come on, guys, eat.\\
200 - These potatoes are heavenly.\\
201 - Thank you.\\
202 - So, yesterday, in my gifted class--\\
203 - I'm not bragging that I'm gifted,\\
204 - that's just what they call the class--\\
205 - we studied bovine spongiform encephalitis.\\
206 - It's mad cow disease.\\
207 - It started because they were grinding up dead cows\\
208 - to feed them to the other cows.\\
209 - Basically, the prions turn their brains into soup\\
210 - right in their skulls.\\
211 - It's very similar to a disease\\
212 - that afflicted a tribe of cannibals\\
213 - because they feasted\\
214 - on their victims' brains.\\
215 - Hey, Patty,\\
216 - I have a trick for you.\\
217 - What's your address?\\
218 - Um, 531 North Canton.\\
219 - What's your favorite color?\\
220 - I don't know. Blue, I guess.\\
221 - Mine, too.\\
222 - Hello, Patty Henderson of 531 North Canton\\
223 - whose favorite color is blue just like...\\
224 - I can dance. Want me to show you?\\
225 - Okay.\\
226 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boop bee    \\
227 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boo    \\
228 -     Boop bee, boop bee    \\
229 -     Boop bee, boop bee    \\
230 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boo    \\
231 -     Boop bee, boop bee    \\
232 -     Boop bee, bee...    \\
233 - This is just embarrassing.\\
234 -     Boop bee, boo    \\
235 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee...    \\
236 - Oh, my God, you little angel.\\
237 - That is the cutest thing.\\
238 -     Boop bee, boo    \\
239 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee    \\
240 -     Boo bee...    \\
241 - Why are we doing the dishes anyways?\\
242 - I don't know. Just shut up.\\
243 - All right!\\
244 - Oh!\\
245 - I'll get it.\\
246 - Keeps going under the bed.\\
247 - Oh, there it is.\\
248 - Here, let me just wiggle it a little more.\\
249 - Oh, my God, I just\\
250 - pushed it in even farther.\\
251 - Oh, got it.\\
252 - Oh, wait, what's this?\\
253 - Okay. Now you're all squeaky clean.\\
254 - Now go put on your pajamas.\\
255 - Hi, guys.\\
256 - All right, drop the cute stuff.\\
257 - What cute stuff?\\
258 - You! Standing there with your big eyes\\
259 - and your dopey voice.\\
260 - I have to resist hugging you myself.\\
261 - I'm not doing anything.\\
262 - Yeah? Then what's that?\\
263 - Nothing.\\
264 - You were going to make her a card?\\
265 - No.\\
266 - You like glitter, Dewey?\\
267 - Dewey?\\
268 - This is the way he is.\\
269 - He's a walking disaster area.\\
270 - Guess who needs another bath?\\
271 - Come on, you.\\
272 - Now, not so much ice this time.\\
273 - I'm not cold.\\
274 - Hey, why don't you pay for dinner, since we got parking.\\
275 - You're taking advantage of me because I'm drunk?\\
276 - Yeah.\\
277 - I wish he would.\\
278 - Okay.\\
279 - I hope you're proud of yourself.\\
280 - I can't help it.\\
281 - I don't know what it is.\\
282 - It's like the guy gives off some kind of scent.\\
283 - The hair on the back of my neck stands up,\\
284 - and I want to tear him apart.\\
285 - I would never have the courage to do what Hal did.\\
286 - Oh, sure, occasionally I'll yell at someone.\\
287 - It's always with the car window rolled up.\\
288 - Can I just say thank you?\\
289 - Tom, don't encourage him.\\
290 - I'm just saying, I'd do what Hal did if I could.\\
291 - But you can't because you're a coward.\\
292 - That's my point.\\
293 - And I've got Mr. Sorenson for math.\\
294 - Do you think that guy ever changes his pants?\\
295 - 'Cause I don't think so.\\
296 - Really?\\
297 - Listen to me rambling on and on.\\
298 - I have completely lost track of time.\\
299 - Uh, this call? About 97 minutes.\\
300 - It's been so great talking to you.\\
301 - Yeah, yeah, you, too.\\
302 - You were always so nice to me.\\
303 - Ah, well, you deserve it, you know.\\
304 - You're a nice person.\\
305 - I'm wearing one of your shirts.\\
306 - I was going to sleep in it tonight.\\
307 - I hope you don't mind.\\
308 - No, no.\\
309 - Anyway, um...\\
310 - I-I don't know quite how to say this,\\
311 - so I'm just going to say it.\\
312 - I think you're really special.\\
313 - And, um, well...\\
314 - I heard you were going to be home in a couple of weeks,\\
315 - and, well, my parents are going to be out of town,\\
316 - and I thought maybe you could come over\\
317 - and we could... you know.\\
318 - Listen, Patty, I have to say this,\\
319 - and I am sorry, but I don't want to lead you on.\\
320 - I am so not physically attracted to you.\\
321 - Like, at all.\\
322 - I think of you as a friend.\\
323 - Uh-huh.\\
324 - Oh, Patty, see, now I hurt your feelings.\\
325 - I know this may be really hard for you to believe,\\
326 - but there is someone out there\\
327 - who will find you physically attractive.\\
328 - And you'll find him, and when you do...\\
329 - Look, I get it, Francis.\\
330 - Okay, someone's out there for me, and it's not you!\\
331 - That's the spirit.\\
332 - You had to do it, man.\\
333 - It's tough when you're their one shot at happiness.\\
334 - This is going to send her straight to the fridge.\\
335 - Hey, Patty, want to play video hockey?\\
336 - Um, not right now.\\
337 - Hey, where are you going?\\
338 - To find out what's wrong and make her feel better.\\
339 - No. I'll go find out what's wrong and make her feel better.\\
340 - You'll just make her more upset.\\
341 - I happen to be sensitive.\\
342 - You're stupid and a creep.\\
343 - I'll kick your ass!\\
344 - Say I can make her feel better!\\
345 - No!\\
346 -     Boop bee    \\
347 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boo    \\
348 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boo    \\
349 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boo...    \\
350 - You are so sweet.\\
351 -     Boop bee, boop bee    \\
352 -     Boop bee, boop bee, boop bee, boo...    \\
353 - He's cute.\\
354 - I hate him for being cute.\\
355 - I don't feel so good.\\
356 - Maybe it was the oysters.\\
357 - Uh-huh. Hal, do you have the...\\
358 - Where's Hal?\\
359 - I used to have a Rottweiler like this.\\
360 - Excuse me.\\
361 - I can't believe she's sleeping in the bed right down the hall.\\
362 - I can't sleep.\\
363 - He's not that cute.\\
364 - What's the matter?\\
365 - I'm scared.\\
366 - I had a nightmare.\\
367 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
368 - Want to sleep with me?\\
369 - Okay, come on.\\
370 - All righty.\\
371 - I don't believe it.\\
372 - I'm supposed to be the genius, and I'm being outsmarted\\
373 - by a kid who can't even tie his own shoes.\\
374 - We can't let him get away with this.\\
375 - We're taking him down.\\
376 - Would you stop this, please?!\\
377 - You are humiliating me in front of my friends!\\
378 - I'm okay.\\
379 - You are both middle-aged men.\\
380 - You are too old and too weak to accomplish anything here!\\
381 - It's too late! Something snapped!\\
382 - I'm way past the point of no return.\\
383 - We're talking primal animal urges!\\
384 - I'm going to let nature take its course and kill him!\\
385 - In 30 seconds,\\
386 - I am going to instruct these men to let you go.\\
387 - Thank you, Lois. Thank you.\\
388 - And then you will have a choice.\\
389 - You can indulge your primal urges with him, or...\\
390 - ...you can come back to the motel\\
391 - and indulge your primal urges with me.\\
392 - Don't trivialize my anger, Lois!\\
393 - I mean, there are some things\\
394 - that you just don't try to talk people out of.\\
395 - I have a legitimate situation here.\\
396 - I know, baby.\\
397 - It's working.\\
398 - Okay, I'll hold him,\\
399 - you put the tape over his mouth.\\
400 - Then we'll take him to the garage.\\
401 - Where did he go?\\
402 - There he is.\\
403 - Come to papa.\\
404 - He locked us out!\\
405 - Dewey, come to bed.\\
406 - Okay.\\
407 - Great.\\
408 - What are we supposed to do now?\\
409 - Oh, my God, what is this stuff?!\\
410 - Well, at least the night wasn't a total loss.\\
411 - Oh, geez. Oh, what is that?
\subsection {Episode 07: Robbery}
1 - All right, that's enough for me.\\
2 - You coming to bed?\\
3 - Yeah, in a minute.\\
4 - Whoa.\\
5 - Bastardo.\\
6 - Wow! You sure got up early.\\
7 - Yup. No rest for the weary.\\
8 - Wait a minute.\\
9 - Did you even come to bed last night?\\
10 - No, dear.\\
11 - I stayed up all night watching Mexican soap operas.\\
12 - Bye-bye.\\
13 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
14 -     I don't know    \\
15 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\
24 -     Life is unfair.    \\
25 - Hi, Lois.\\
26 - Oh! Hi, Craig.\\
27 - Notice anything different about me?\\
28 - Nope.\\
29 - Just got her in today.\\
30 - "Craig Feldspar. Assistant Manager."\\
31 - Congratulations.\\
32 - That's great.\\
33 - And along with the red badge,\\
34 - as you know, comes an extra two-percent discount,\\
35 - which I'm more than willing to share with you, Lois.\\
36 - Oh, no, Craig, that's  your  discount.\\
37 - Really, it's no... I wouldn't feel right\\
38 - about jeopardizing your position\\
39 - by taking advantage of that.\\
40 - I just... I wouldn't feel right about it.\\
41 - But what good is all that power\\
42 - if I have no one to share it with?\\
43 - Theresa, would you mind checking out aisle four?\\
44 - Seemed to have noticed someone knocked over the candy rack.\\
45 - And could you put the coffee-toffees on a lower shelf?\\
46 - Okay.\\
47 - Did you see that? Did you see that resentment?\\
48 - Isn't it wonderful?\\
49 - Look at me, I'm shaking.\\
50 - This is my favorite part of the day.\\
51 - The twilight time between school ending\\
52 - and when your parents come home.\\
53 - The time when kids rule the Earth.\\
54 - Okay, what was this?\\
55 - Uh... Superman.\\
56 - Boys, come quick!\\
57 - Something wonderful has happened!\\
58 - Huh?\\
59 - Isn't she beautiful?\\
60 - And to think someone was just throwing her out.\\
61 - She was under six bags of garbage,\\
62 - but, oh, I knew your mother would love her.\\
63 - When does she get home?\\
64 - She's working till 10:00. Great!\\
65 - Gives us plenty of time to get her ready.\\
66 - Dad, it's junk.\\
67 - Reese, with a little paint and some new hardware,\\
68 - one man's junk is another man's anniversary present.\\
69 - Come on, help me get her inside.\\
70 - Come in.\\
71 - Look,\\
72 - you probably think I'm here to criticize you\\
73 - for not doing my homework yesterday,\\
74 - but let's not think about that.\\
75 - Let's think about tomorrow's assignment.\\
76 - So, if you can get that to me by 8:00, that'd be great.\\
77 - Or 9:00.\\
78 - Okay, what's wrong?\\
79 - My Julie...\\
80 - she left me!\\
81 - What happened?\\
82 - I don't know,\\
83 - but it's really over.\\
84 - She sent back all of my love gifts.\\
85 - Wow, that's cold.\\
86 - Oh, come on, this guy's adorable.\\
87 - Press its belly.\\
88 - That's okay.\\
89 - Look, I've had a lot of experience with heartache,\\
90 - and I'll tell you one thing.\\
91 - You've got to find a way to get your mind off it.\\
92 - Look! Here's my homework.\\
93 - I don't know what I'm going to do.\\
94 - She was my light, my life and my world!\\
95 - She put out, huh?\\
96 - Like crazy!\\
97 - Can I help you?\\
98 - Give me your money.\\
99 - Oh, for crying out loud, again?\\
100 - Shut up and hand it over. Okay, just relax, cowboy.\\
101 - We have a way of doing this so nobody gets hurt.\\
102 - I give you every bit of money in this drawer,\\
103 - and you and your friend just leave. Okay?\\
104 - Okay.\\
105 - See? Nobody gets hurt.\\
106 - Nobody gets caught.\\
107 - Everybody happy. Okay?\\
108 - Lois, I think Cheryl A.\\
109 - flipped me off behind my back.\\
110 - Craig, I am, uh, I'm with some customers.\\
111 - There you go. Bye now.\\
112 - Did you enjoy your Lucky Aide shopping experience, gentlemen?\\
113 - Craig, uh, they're in a hurry.\\
114 - This won't take a second.\\
115 - I am Craig, the assistant manager.\\
116 - I can assure you, if there's one thing\\
117 - we value here at Luck Aide, it is customer satisfaction.\\
118 - We're satisfied.\\
119 - Well, you don't sound like it.\\
120 - Please, don't feel like you're going to hurt my feelings,\\
121 - because I'm learning here.\\
122 - Now, I'm sure there's something I could do\\
123 - to make this a better experience for you.\\
124 - Yeah. How about you walk me to every other register\\
125 - in this place and give me every cent you've got?\\
126 - That's a gun!\\
127 - Craig, calm down.\\
128 - Everybody, calm down.\\
129 - I've been through this five times.\\
130 - We just give them the money\\
131 - from all the other registers, and they'll leave.\\
132 - What about the safe?\\
133 - Safe?\\
134 - ...ty.\\
135 - Safe-ty of the customers.\\
136 - I'll lock the doors.\\
137 - You start rounding up the customers.\\
138 - What, are you nuts? We got to get out of here.\\
139 - Come on, man. I'm tired of doing these dinky little holdups.\\
140 - Have you ever wanted to do\\
141 - something more important with your life?\\
142 - What do you mean, like, go back to school?\\
143 - No, man! Like breaking into a safe.\\
144 - Do you want to work at Orange Julius forever?\\
145 - All right, everybody over to sundries!\\
146 - Easy.\\
147 - Easy.\\
148 - Easy.\\
149 - Whoo! Your mother's going to flip when she sees this.\\
150 - Ha-ha!\\
151 - Well, that's just crazy.\\
152 - Why would someone fill this\\
153 - with hundreds of hanging black bow ties?\\
154 - Those aren't bow ties.\\
155 - Those are bats.\\
156 - Don't you worry, Lois.\\
157 - Everything is going to be fine. Just fine and dandy.\\
158 - Yeah, keep waving that thing around, buddy-boy.\\
159 - You got a big surprise coming.\\
160 - Craig, that button has been disconnected for over a year.\\
161 - What?! Why? Because you kept hitting the damn thing.\\
162 - In an emergency, yes. That's what it's for.\\
163 - Oh, like an emergency when you saw a bee?\\
164 - Or when you saw that big fly that looked like a bee?\\
165 - How about when you thought you saw a ghost?\\
166 - I'm not saying it was or it wasn't,\\
167 - but you can't tell me what we saw was normal.\\
168 - All right, you two!\\
169 - Let's move it.\\
170 - He likes waving that around too much.\\
171 - This is going to end in body bags.\\
172 - No, Craig, it isn't.\\
173 - Lois... before we die, I have to tell you something.\\
174 - It's about how I feel...\\
175 - Craig, no.\\
176 - But, Lois... Craig, no!\\
177 - This will all be over soon.\\
178 - How much?\\
179 - Boy.\\
180 - Well, can you guarantee that you'll get all of them?\\
181 - What? That's per bat?!\\
182 - Are you insane?!\\
183 - God!\\
184 - Well, boys, looks like we're on our own.\\
185 - What are you talking about?\\
186 - Isn't anyone coming?\\
187 - I'm scared.\\
188 - Aw... I know, son.\\
189 - Now, just think of them this way.\\
190 - They're only rats with wings.\\
191 - And radar.\\
192 - Just flying rats with radar.\\
193 - Say it with me. Just...\\
194 - Flying rats with radar.\\
195 - Once again.\\
196 - Flying rats with...\\
197 - Okay, it's important that everybody just say calm.\\
198 - And don't make any sudden moves, or they'll kill you.\\
199 - And don't look them in the eye,\\
200 - or they'll kill you.\\
201 - And don't beg them not to kill you, or they'll kill you.\\
202 - I need you to stop talking.\\
203 - You! Assistant manager! Come here!\\
204 - This is it.\\
205 - I didn't feed my cat.\\
206 - Isn't it funny the things\\
207 - that go through your mind before you die?\\
208 - Craig, they just want to talk to you.\\
209 - Lois, before we're all killed in a bloody mess,\\
210 - I have to tell you...\\
211 - Shh! Let's not think those negative thoughts.\\
212 - Let's just give them the money and get them out of here.\\
213 - Hey, is there any way we can speed this along?\\
214 - Yeah. Somebody can give us the combination to the safe.\\
215 - Fine. I can't, but the assistant manager can.\\
216 - Craig, give them the combination to the safe.\\
217 - No.\\
218 - What?\\
219 - You can't have it.\\
220 - Yes, they can.\\
221 - Craig, give them the combination.\\
222 - Let me talk to them.\\
223 - What's the combo?!\\
224 - Ca...\\
225 -        \\
226 - See? Told you I'd make it all better.\\
227 - Better?\\
228 - How could this possibly cheer me up?\\
229 - Watching a bunch of naked, middle-aged women\\
230 - degrade themselves in a place\\
231 - that smells like urine and cigarettes?\\
232 - When you put it that way,\\
233 - you can make anything sound terrible.\\
234 - You know, sometimes\\
235 - you just make it so hard to be nice.\\
236 - Hey, you want to see the real show in back?\\
237 - No.\\
238 - Yes. Yes, he does.\\
239 - Cost you $50.\\
240 - Look, I only have $20, so let's just... Done.\\
241 - Hey, watch out!\\
242 - You idiots!\\
243 - It was just Mom's bra.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - What is it?\\
246 - Kill it!\\
247 - Ow! Ah!\\
248 - Is it gone?! Is it gone?!\\
249 - Dewey, it's gone.\\
250 - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
251 - You feeling better?\\
252 - Yeah, I think so. Thanks.\\
253 - Good.\\
254 - Now tell me the damn combination!\\
255 - No.\\
256 - Can I talk to you for a second?\\
257 - Listen, fellas.\\
258 - I want to get this over with as much as you do.\\
259 - So why don't you give me five minutes with him.\\
260 - I guarantee you I will get that combination for you.\\
261 - Listen, Craig, I think these guys really mean business.\\
262 - Now, you know and I know\\
263 - there is less than $700 in that safe.\\
264 - Do you really think the lives of seven employees\\
265 - is worth less than $700?\\
266 - Lois, this isn't just about the money.\\
267 - Sometimes a man has to have his dignity.\\
268 - So what if they kill me?\\
269 - But before they kill you, they're going to try\\
270 - to get that combination from you any way they can.\\
271 - Can you picture yourself with shattered eye sockets?\\
272 - Because that's where they're going to start.\\
273 - They can break every one of your fingers and toes.\\
274 - They can even cut a couple of them off.\\
275 - Did... did you see the buck knife in the big guy's boot?\\
276 - Do you really want to antagonize that big buck knife, Craig?\\
277 - Do you really want to feel it slicing into your flesh?\\
278 - Craig, stay with me.\\
279 - Stay...\\
280 - Damn.\\
281 - Pass the salt, please.\\
282 - How long do we have to stay in here?\\
283 - Till all the bats are gone.\\
284 - And with every window and door wide open in this house,\\
285 - it's only a matter of time.\\
286 - Can't new ones just fly in?\\
287 - So, Dewey, how was school today?\\
288 - Mikey Duffy\\
289 - pushed me down. Did you push him back?\\
290 - No. He's bigger than me.\\
291 - Uh-huh. Reese?\\
292 - I'm on it.\\
293 - This is crazy!\\
294 - I can't eat!\\
295 - Why? Is something bothering you at school, son?\\
296 - Oh. Right.\\
297 - Anybody want my baked potato?\\
298 - It's kind of burnt.\\
299 - No, thanks.\\
300 - Reese, we aren't having baked potatoes.\\
301 - All right! That's it!\\
302 - Let's just move!\\
303 - Mom will find us somehow.\\
304 - No.\\
305 - I'm tired of running.\\
306 - I'm tired of screaming like a girl every five minutes.\\
307 - I will not be put out of my home\\
308 - by a bunch of airborne rodents, and neither will you!\\
309 - I may have been the one that brought them into this house,\\
310 - but it is up to all of us to show them the door.\\
311 - Get ready, boys.\\
312 - It's time to put out the bats.\\
313 - Ha-ha!\\
314 - Ow!\\
315 - Oh, yeah!\\
316 - I got your money here!\\
317 - Okay, this isn't exactly what we expected...\\
318 - but, hey, now you can say you've been to a cockfight.\\
319 - Okay, Dewey, there's one bat left,\\
320 - and it's in your mother's room.\\
321 - Now, this one is the tricky bat,\\
322 - the one who has eluded all the other traps.\\
323 - What was it you named him? Tricky.\\
324 - Right. Well, now we have a very good trap,\\
325 - but someone has to lure Tricky into it,\\
326 - and that someone is you.\\
327 - Why me? Because...\\
328 - you have the shortest hair.\\
329 - You see, if he lands on your head,\\
330 - he'll just bite once and fly away,\\
331 - but if he lands on your brother's or my head,\\
332 - he'll get caught in our hair\\
333 - and bite us and bite us until we are dead.\\
334 - Do you understand that?\\
335 - Yes. Good.\\
336 - Now...\\
337 - I want you to go in that room\\
338 - and poke him with this stick until that bat chases you.\\
339 - Good luck.\\
340 - I don't know about you, boys,\\
341 - but I am awfully darn proud of us.\\
342 - All right, somebody get the dustpan.\\
343 - Lois, are you all right?\\
344 - No, I am not all right.\\
345 - I'm sitting here at gunpoint, and I wouldn't have to be\\
346 - if you'd stop being stupid and give them the combination.\\
347 - I told you, I can't do that.\\
348 - Craig, please. I'm frightened.\\
349 - I want to go home and be with my family.\\
350 - They never told me the combination.\\
351 - What did you just say?\\
352 - They never told me the combination.\\
353 - They said they couldn't trust me with it.\\
354 - They gave the combination\\
355 - to the guy who runs the photo lab next door.\\
356 - He comes in at night and transfers the money.\\
357 - Why didn't you just say this earlier?\\
358 - I don't know. I guess I wasn't in a big rush\\
359 - to let everybody know what a pathetic idiot I am.\\
360 - Oh, Craig, I'm so sorry.\\
361 - Lois, I love you.\\
362 - What?\\
363 - Lois, I love you with all my heart.\\
364 - You're my reason to get up in the morning.\\
365 - You are my everything. Craig...\\
366 - Lois, I don't want to feel this way.\\
367 - I know you're married, I know you have four beautiful boys.\\
368 - It's my heart.\\
369 - I wish I didn't have a heart...\\
370 - but I do, and I can't help loving you.\\
371 - I can't help loving you with my stupid, stupid heart.\\
372 - Oh, Craig... why'd you have to say that?\\
373 - Dear sweet Craig.\\
374 - I am truly sorry.\\
375 - I'm sorry for the way you feel.\\
376 - I'm sorry for any indication I ever gave you\\
377 - that I consider you anything more than a friend.\\
378 - And I am so sorry for what I have to do now...\\
379 - because now I have to crush whatever it is in you\\
380 - that made you do what you just did.\\
381 - I am going to have to hurt you\\
382 - very, very badly, but believe me, Craig,\\
383 - it's for your own good.\\
384 - Number one...\\
385 - no to everything you just said.\\
386 - No to what you're thinking.\\
387 - No to everything you dream.\\
388 - No to your what-ifs.\\
389 - No to every single fantasy, wish, dream,\\
390 - and elaborate scenario that involves the two of us.\\
391 - No, no, no!\\
392 - Number two...\\
393 - Ow!\\
394 - Remember that pain.\\
395 - And whenever a thought creeps into your head\\
396 - wondering if there's anything more\\
397 - to the hello I gave you in the morning,\\
398 - you remember that pain.\\
399 - You have no future with me.\\
400 - You have nothing with me.\\
401 - I'm sorry.\\
402 - Whoa, chubs, you got faced.\\
403 - You want this?!\\
404 - You want this stupid, stupid, stupid safe?!\\
405 - Here's your stupid safe!\\
406 - Cool.\\
407 - Craig, are you all right?\\
408 - I don't know. I heard something rip,\\
409 - and if it wasn't my pants, it was inside of me.\\
410 - See? What'd I tell you?\\
411 - Cockfighting is illegal.\\
412 - But you made some good bets.\\
413 - What'd you win, ten bucks?\\
414 - You should feel good about that.\\
415 - We are going to jail!\\
416 - When my parents find out, I'll be living\\
417 - in military institutions until I'm emancipated!\\
418 - You don't even realize how serious this is, do you?!\\
419 - You know what the funny thing is though?\\
420 - You did manage to put things in perspective.\\
421 - There are worse things than losing your girlfriend,\\
422 - and I've experienced every one of them tonight.\\
423 - Thank you, Francis.\\
424 - I really owe you one.\\
425 - You know, I think I'll be back in circulation in no time.\\
426 - You never know.\\
427 - Craig, our assistant manager, just tossed the safe at them.\\
428 - I never saw anything like it.\\
429 - The guy's a hero.\\
430 -     Hey, did you happen to see    \\
431 -     The most beautiful girl in the world?    \\
432 -     And if you did    \\
433 -     Was she crying    \\
434 -     Crying?    \\
435 -     Hey    \\
436 -     Did you happen to see    \\
437 -     The most beautiful girl    \\
438 -     That walked out on me?    \\
439 -     Tell her I'm sorry    \\
440 -     Tell her I need my baby    \\
441 -     Oh, ho-ho-ho...    \\
442 - You sure worked late.\\
443 - How was your night?\\
444 - Good.\\
445 - Yours?\\
446 - Fine.\\
447 - Why is there an armoire in the living room?\\
448 - Happy anniversary.
\subsection {Episode 08: Therapy}
1 - Did you get the eclairs?\\
2 - I did, but they only had three left,\\
3 - and I had to cut in front of an old woman to get those.\\
4 - Well, I just won't have one.\\
5 - No, no, no, no. I won't have one.\\
6 - You and Dewey can split one.\\
7 - That's not fair to Dewey.\\
8 - Forget it.\\
9 - We'll just let the boys have them.\\
10 - False alarm.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - As near as I can figure,\\
24 - my school was created for the sole purpose\\
25 - of making me miserable.\\
26 - Today in Krelboyne class, we start Medieval Week.\\
27 - Where's your jester costume?\\
28 - In my backpack. I'll wear it at school.\\
29 - Put it on.\\
30 - I didn't stay up all night making it for my health.\\
31 - Bells-- oh, I forgot the bells.\\
32 - You look so adorable.\\
33 - You know what I love about Medieval Week?\\
34 - Is that you can spot the Krelboynes\\
35 - from super far away, and they jingle when you hit them.\\
36 - Reese.\\
37 - Leave your brother alone.\\
38 - Although you are asking for it.\\
39 - Okay, ready?\\
40 - Ready?\\
41 - Come here.\\
42 - Why don't you just put a bull's-eye on my chest\\
43 - and get it over with?\\
44 - Oh, you look fine.\\
45 - And Reese will tell me if you take these off.\\
46 - When I was six, I dove in a pool and my trunks came off.\\
47 - God, I wish I was there right now.\\
48 - All right, children, it's time to begin the harvest dance.\\
49 - I'd demonstrate myself, but being in my third trimester,\\
50 - I don't want to risk\\
51 - the placenta separating from my uterine wall.\\
52 - Oh, come on.\\
53 - We studied this.\\
54 - There's nothing dirty about the miracle of life.\\
55 - And we should all be able to discuss this openly.\\
56 - Who's the father?\\
57 - Does he... work here?\\
58 - All right, you know, I told you\\
59 - we are not playing this game again.\\
60 - All right, everyone, gather their dance props, please.\\
61 - Dabney, don't forget you have a dentist appointment.\\
62 - Okay.\\
63 - Your Holiness, would you start the gay-- as in happy--\\
64 - Harvest Procession?\\
65 - Let's... kick it.\\
66 - Dabney has three dentist appointments every week.\\
67 - His teeth look fine to me.\\
68 - He's not going to the dentist.\\
69 - He's going to the "dentist."\\
70 - It's a secret code for the school therapist.\\
71 - How come you know that? You see the shrink, too?\\
72 - Yes, I'm currently seeing Ms. Gilbert.\\
73 - My mother and stepfather suggested it\\
74 - as a preemptive strike\\
75 - against my anger displacement tendencies.\\
76 - But ultimately, therapy was my decision.\\
77 - Not theirs... mine.\\
78 - It was voluntary.\\
79 - Okay.\\
80 - Yes, I am!\\
81 - My fear of rejection is virtually gone,\\
82 - and my self-worth is at an all-time high.\\
83 - I really think you're going to like laundry duty, Francis.\\
84 - Basically, you wash it, you dry it, you fold it.\\
85 - You want me to go through that again?\\
86 - No, twice was good.\\
87 - Actually, I don't mind doing laundry.\\
88 - Mom always thought she was punishing me,\\
89 - but I always found it relaxing.\\
90 - Geez, this detergent is awful.\\
91 - This is way too coarse for our cotton blends.\\
92 - Wasn't this stuff banned?\\
93 - Yeah, this is what we use.\\
94 - You see, there is an arrangement with the distributor.\\
95 - We take this crappy soap off his hands,\\
96 - and, uh, he makes it worth our while.\\
97 - The Alabama Opera?\\
98 - There's plenty more where that came from.\\
99 - No thanks.\\
100 - Opera's not your thing.\\
101 - That's fine.\\
102 - This guy's got connections.\\
103 - Cords of firewood, tractor show,\\
104 - free burgers from Churchill's when you buy a burger\\
105 - of equal or greater value.\\
106 - Don't you think Marlin Academy is hard enough\\
107 - without our own guys selling us out?\\
108 - I mean, look at these.\\
109 - You ever heard of fabric softener?\\
110 - These sheets are like\\
111 - sleeping on straw.\\
112 - Hey, it was good enough for the baby Jesus.\\
113 - Get out.\\
114 - Where are my cooling racks?\\
115 - I know I put them in here. What a mess!\\
116 - Honey, please.\\
117 - I'll go to the store,\\
118 - and I'll buy you new cooling racks.\\
119 - No! I want to find these.\\
120 - And when I do, we are all going to clean out\\
121 - this disaster of a closet.\\
122 - It's going to be our new family project.\\
123 - We never finished our last family project.\\
124 - Because it's in here, under two tons of crap.\\
125 - Your dentist appointment, Lloyd?\\
126 - My teeth feel fine today, Caroline.\\
127 - I like myself.\\
128 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
129 - Great news!\\
130 - We have been granted permission to perform the harvest dance\\
131 - at the all-school assembly today.\\
132 - And fruit will be handed out to the student body\\
133 - in case they want to join in.\\
134 - Okay, everyone get in their circles,\\
135 - and...\\
136 - Sorry! Damn!\\
137 - Stupid!\\
138 - I can't do it!\\
139 - I'm stupid and I'm terrible!\\
140 - I suck at everything!\\
141 - And I'm fat!\\
142 - Okay, you just get comfortable.\\
143 - We'll talk when you're ready.\\
144 - Thank you, Ms. Gilbert.\\
145 - Okay, so I faked it.\\
146 - But with the family I have,\\
147 - it would've only been a matter of time anyway.\\
148 - We should probably talk a little now. Do we have to?\\
149 - Well, that's sort of why you're here.\\
150 - That sucked! Where'd that flamethrower come from?\\
151 - Malcolm,\\
152 - I want you to feel relaxed here.\\
153 - Now, school's really stressful and can be pretty demanding.\\
154 - This could be...\\
155 - this could be a safe place for you to unwind.\\
156 - Not the face! Not the face!\\
157 - Could I... unwind... four or five times a week?\\
158 - Maybe. What would we talk about?\\
159 - I don't know where to begin.\\
160 - I really don't.\\
161 - Well, that was quite an episode you had in class.\\
162 - Did you want to talk about that?\\
163 - No.\\
164 - You'll just think it's stupid.\\
165 - Nothing you ever say in here will be stupid.\\
166 - But all I ever do is make mistakes.\\
167 - I feel like I don't even deserve to beat my own high score.\\
168 - Oh, yes, you do, Malcolm.\\
169 - Thank you so much.\\
170 - The tricky part is, I need to keep this up\\
171 - without being put on medication.\\
172 - Underpants! In a closet!\\
173 - Human underpants!\\
174 - I must not threaten you people enough!\\
175 - Oh, my Lord.\\
176 - Skittles!\\
177 - You've been missing for years.\\
178 - You missed a great assembly.\\
179 - I can't believe it.\\
180 - They actually gave us fruit to throw at the Krelboynes.\\
181 - What were they thinking?\\
182 - Don't you ever get tired of making their lives miserable?\\
183 - Nope. Besides, I want them to remember who's boss.\\
184 - When they're living in their mansions\\
185 - with their supermodel wives,\\
186 - they're going to know--\\
187 - the guy cleaning their pool kicked their ass.\\
188 - Hey.\\
189 - I had six tomatoes with your name on them.\\
190 - Where were you?\\
191 - None of your business.\\
192 - Maybe it's Mom's business.\\
193 - I ditched to go to the arcade.\\
194 - Don't tell Mom.\\
195 - The arcade's closed.\\
196 - Not the one at the mall.\\
197 - Wait a minute...\\
198 - I  can  smell my own breath.\\
199 - You throw the ball around the post;\\
200 - it swings back and knocks down the pins, okay?\\
201 - I was good.\\
202 - I was real good.\\
203 - All right, now, don't be upset\\
204 - if the first time you throw it, nothing hap...\\
205 - Wow!\\
206 - That was... that was a flopper!\\
207 - Ooh, man! Oh, man!\\
208 - That was, that was a lucky shot, okay?\\
209 - Now, the real key\\
210 - to Skittles is the release point, all right?\\
211 - When you release the ball,\\
212 - make sure that it goes through on a parallel...\\
213 - I can't believe it!\\
214 - This collar's so crisp, yet it doesn't chafe.\\
215 - And these sheets...\\
216 - it's like sleeping on a cloud.\\
217 - My pleasure, guys.\\
218 - Dude...\\
219 - thank you.\\
220 - I've been hoping for months\\
221 - that my rash was from the laundry.\\
222 - Turns out it was.\\
223 - Thanks.\\
224 - Glad I could help.\\
225 - Here, this is for you.\\
226 - No, Joe, you don't have to.\\
227 - I insist.\\
228 - Wow.\\
229 - Well, that was nice of you.\\
230 - Hey, would you mind tossing in some of my civilian stuff\\
231 - with the academy rags?\\
232 - Oh, I'd love to, but I'm really swamped down here.\\
233 - Well, yeah, whatever.\\
234 - Guess I could find some time for your stuff.\\
235 - Hey... thanks, man.\\
236 - No, no, no, you don't have to...\\
237 - You're the best.\\
238 - Go.\\
239 - Ha-cha!\\
240 - Garbage! In a closet!\\
241 - Coffee grounds? Hal!\\
242 - Lois, you've got to see this.\\
243 - The boy's a prodigy. Go.\\
244 - Yes.\\
245 - Who are the Petersons?\\
246 - Why do we have their photo albums?\\
247 - Here we go.\\
248 - Now.\\
249 - Amazing!\\
250 - Hi, Malcolm. How was school?\\
251 - It was normal.\\
252 - Yeah, I'd say normal.\\
253 - Very medieval.\\
254 - Is that a truck tire?\\
255 - What?!\\
256 - Oh, my G... Hal!\\
257 -        \\
258 - Um, Malcolm...\\
259 - I wanted you to know how proud I am of you.\\
260 - Admitting you needed help is the hardest step.\\
261 - No, keeping up with all\\
262 - the new cognitive and behavioral therapies\\
263 - is the hardest step, Lloyd.\\
264 - My self-worth is still skyrocketing.\\
265 - Okay, everybody...\\
266 - tomorrow's looming demonstration\\
267 - has been canceled.\\
268 - Instead, we will be going to see a reenactment\\
269 - of the slaughter of French troops\\
270 - at Azincourt\\
271 - followed by a visit to the Museum of Torture...\\
272 - and then pizza.\\
273 - Museum of Torture?\\
274 - That's awesome.\\
275 - Do they have a gift shop?\\
276 - I'm sorry, Malcolm. You can't go.\\
277 - You've a dentist appointment.\\
278 - You're lucky you're not going.\\
279 - My brother went last year,\\
280 - and there was so much fake blood\\
281 - that he fainted.\\
282 - I think it's time I had a major breakthrough in therapy.\\
283 - Then a butterfly landed on my wrist and I woke up.\\
284 - What color was that butterfly?\\
285 - It was either blue or purple.\\
286 - Definitely not red or orange.\\
287 - That I can remember.\\
288 - Your dream, Malcolm, is so...\\
289 - so tranquil and soothing.\\
290 - This is, this is encouraging.\\
291 - Yeah? Mm-hmm.\\
292 - Yep, you're starting to relax.\\
293 - I think I might be, too.\\
294 - I need to seem cured,\\
295 - but to leave the door open for a relapse\\
296 - when we start ballet next semester.\\
297 - I know I'll have my ups and downs,\\
298 - but right now it feels good to be happy.\\
299 - Well, I'm glad to hear it,\\
300 - and I think we've made a lot of progress.\\
301 - Thanks, Ms. Gilbert.\\
302 - I like myself now.\\
303 - And I know I couldn't have said that on Tuesday.\\
304 - What are you doing here?\\
305 - I figured out your scam.\\
306 - It turns out\\
307 - crazy runs in the family. Reese...\\
308 - you don't know what you're doing.\\
309 - You're going to ruin everything.\\
310 - Relax. I've got it covered.\\
311 - I'm ready to see you now, Reese.\\
312 - Reese isn't here right now.\\
313 - This is Davey.\\
314 - That's ten in a row.\\
315 - Oh, Lois, he's got the gift.\\
316 - Since the end of the big war,\\
317 - there's only been one documented triple consecutive flopper\\
318 - in English Alley Skittles.\\
319 - You know what this means?\\
320 - I finally have something to rub in the face\\
321 - of that blowhard Higgins and his little tennis champion.\\
322 - What are you talking about?\\
323 - Oh, he's constantly harping about his kid\\
324 - winning this tournament,\\
325 - winning that tournament.\\
326 - Going to the White House.\\
327 - I'm taking Dewey over there\\
328 - to shut that guy up once and for all.\\
329 - Hey, you ready to shut that guy up\\
330 - once and for all, son?\\
331 - What guy? He's ready.\\
332 - Hal, you're just doing this\\
333 - to get out of cleaning out that closet.\\
334 - Not entirely.\\
335 - Let's go, son.\\
336 - What happened?\\
337 - Did you get caught?\\
338 - Where were you?\\
339 - Geez. You're always so angry.\\
340 - Maybe you really do need therapy.\\
341 - What I  need  is for you not to ruin everything for me.\\
342 - Do you know how much trouble we'll be in if we get caught?\\
343 - With Mom? With the school?\\
344 - With  Mom?\\
345 - Give me a little credit, psycho.\\
346 - I've been doing my own research.\\
347 - See, I rented Silence of the Lambs,\\
348 - Seven,  and  The Nutty Professor.\\
349 - Oh, God.\\
350 - Reese, tell me exactly what you told her.\\
351 - Nope. That's confidential.\\
352 - Now, which one do you like more?\\
353 - Hannibal Lecter or the hockey mask?\\
354 - Malcolm, Reese.\\
355 - What do you have to say for yourselves?\\
356 - Don't blame Reese. Blame Davey.\\
357 - Ow! Ow, ow.\\
358 - Ow!\\
359 - I'm sorry it's last minute, but I need these tonight.\\
360 - I got another date with Rebecca.\\
361 - Okay...\\
362 - Seven items... 30 bucks.\\
363 - I don't have that kind of money.\\
364 - Last time it cost ten.\\
365 - You can cut me some slack, can't you?\\
366 - I'd love to do you a solid, Eric, but I'm booked,\\
367 - and it would be unethical to play favorites.\\
368 - You can't do this to me.\\
369 - I need to wear my bowling shirt.\\
370 - Rebecca loves my bowling shirt.\\
371 - Francis, I don't have the money.\\
372 - Well, then, you don't have the clothes.\\
373 - Got to pay to be a player.\\
374 - Look at yourself.\\
375 - I remember the Francis who cared about his job.\\
376 - A cap and a half of fabric softener, Francis.\\
377 - Remember that?\\
378 - A cap and a half!\\
379 - If you'll excuse me, I have some ironing to do.\\
380 - I can't believe him.\\
381 - Yeah. I had to give him three CDs\\
382 - just to get my dress blues pressed.\\
383 - I think it's time somebody taught that guy a lesson.\\
384 - Yeah.\\
385 - We'll make him wear a lame T-shirt.\\
386 - Or we could put it in a load of whites.\\
387 - Just follow me.\\
388 - So, my children are emotionally disturbed?\\
389 - Oh, we don't like to use those labels.\\
390 - I spent a whole week with Malcolm.\\
391 - Really? A whole week.\\
392 - Yes, and, uh...\\
393 - to be honest, I think, I think there are\\
394 - some, uh, definite issues\\
395 - that you and he need to talk about.\\
396 - Malcolm, you want to share\\
397 - this drawing with your mother?\\
398 - No, that's okay.\\
399 - I like what you've done with my teeth.\\
400 - There are some things\\
401 - that Malcolm told me\\
402 - that I think you should hear.\\
403 - Oh, well, I'd love to hear them.\\
404 - Go ahead, Malcolm.\\
405 - Yeah, go ahead.\\
406 - Everybody wants to help.\\
407 - You're safe here.\\
408 - About the anger thing?\\
409 - Yeah.\\
410 - Tell me about the anger thing.\\
411 - When you're angry,\\
412 - you bottle up your feelings\\
413 - and you freeze me out with silence.\\
414 - Well, I will, uh... I'll  try  to be more vocal.\\
415 - Go on.\\
416 - Please.\\
417 - I wish you would spend more time at home\\
418 - and less time at the...\\
419 - the racetrack.\\
420 - Well, I guess I'm going to have to change that, too.\\
421 - Come on, Malcolm.\\
422 - Tell her about the pressure.\\
423 - Well...\\
424 - I feel you put a lot of pressure on me,\\
425 - and I can't live up to your expectations.\\
426 - What pressure?\\
427 - Maybe not. I don't know.\\
428 - No, no, no. Go back. What were you saying?\\
429 - Well, you put a lot of pressure on me, and stuff.\\
430 - What do you mean? When do I pressure you?\\
431 - All the time!\\
432 - If it's not the extra-credit reports,\\
433 - it's all the advanced classes you sign me up for,\\
434 - and after that, I have\\
435 - to help Reese and Dewey with their homework.\\
436 - That's not pressure.\\
437 - You know, I didn't ask to be born smart.\\
438 - We just want you to live up to your potential.\\
439 - That.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.\\
440 - I tried to stop him.\\
441 - I said, "Hey, don't put that red T-shirt in there.\\
442 - That's not colorfast."\\
443 - But he just laughed.\\
444 - He said pink was a better color\\
445 - 'cause that's what "little, weak girls wear."\\
446 - We've looked everywhere else.\\
447 - He's in here somewhere.\\
448 - Shh, shh!\\
449 - Francis?\\
450 - No.\\
451 - It's okay, Dewey.\\
452 - Even the best of them have off-days.\\
453 - Uh-huh.\\
454 - 16 misses in a row.\\
455 - Some people might think you did it on purpose.\\
456 - Huh.\\
457 - Hey...\\
458 - There something you want to tell me, son?\\
459 - I don't want to do this anymore.\\
460 - It's boring.\\
461 - You'd be giving up\\
462 - what might very well be your one true talent.\\
463 - You could be another Chap Sanders, hmm?\\
464 - Son, are you willing to turn your back on your destiny?\\
465 - Yeah. Can I go now?\\
466 - All right, if that's what you want.\\
467 - Wait.\\
468 - Can you throw it for me one more time? Hmm?\\
469 - One last flopper for your old dad?\\
470 - No.\\
471 - All right, then.\\
472 - I'm sorry.\\
473 - Oh, no, don't be.\\
474 - I'm the one who should apologize.\\
475 - No, you guys just want what's best for me. I know that.\\
476 - Oh, we do. We love you.\\
477 - I love you, too.\\
478 - Mom?\\
479 - You really pissed me off\\
480 - when you took away my hockey stick\\
481 - 'cause I was hitting Dewey with it.\\
482 - I know you're sorry.\\
483 - I'll go in the attic and take it down later.\\
484 - Another Peterson box.\\
485 - Ooh. This is from the '60s.\\
486 - Huh. I forgot LBJ had his gall bladder out.\\
487 - I don't understand.\\
488 - Didn't we clean out this closet when we moved in?\\
489 - Apparently not.\\
490 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
491 - They left an old toilet.\\
492 - This is a bathroom.\\
493 - We have a second bathroom!\\
494 - Shh.\\
495 - If we don't tell them, they won't know.\\
496 - It'll just be our little secret.\\
497 - Our beautiful little secret.\\
498 - Here.\\
499 - Yeah.
\subsection {Episode 09: High School Play}
1 - I'm home.\\
2 - Hi, honey.\\
3 - We're on our own tonight.\\
4 - I thought maybe we'd go out to dinner.\\
5 - Where are the kids?\\
6 - Malcolm's over at Stevie's.\\
7 - Reese has got hockey practice.\\
8 - Dewey's at Billy's... or one of the neighbor kids.\\
9 - So, we're on our own.\\
10 - What are you in the mood for?\\
11 - That has got to be a new record.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - There you go.\\
25 - People are always asking our class to volunteer for stuff.\\
26 - They just assume we're social rejects\\
27 - with nothing better to do.\\
28 - It's true.\\
29 - I just don't like having it thrown in my face.\\
30 - So, our school needs a kid about your age\\
31 - to be in our school play.\\
32 - It'll be a lot of fun.\\
33 - The play is by a guy named William Shakespeare.\\
34 - He was a writer way back in the olden times.\\
35 - He was a syphilitic drunk\\
36 - fronting for the 14th Earl of Oxford.\\
37 - Why can't you leave the Bard alone?\\
38 - So he didn't have the benefit of higher education.\\
39 - How many PhDs have written  King Lear?\\
40 - Now, now, now.\\
41 - Try to remember we have a guest.\\
42 - Let's save our heated words for Open Forum Friday.\\
43 - Meghan, continue.\\
44 - Whoever he was, he had a pointy little beard\\
45 - and he wrote a really good play called\\
46 - A Midsummer Night's Dream.\\
47 - We need someone to play the Changeling Boy.\\
48 - Okay, before anyone gets too excited,\\
49 - there is a downside.\\
50 - You'll probably have to miss class.\\
51 - I'll do it! He can't.\\
52 - We're working on a secret project that...\\
53 - I've said too much.\\
54 - Okay, I thought we agreed no more\\
55 - secret projects.\\
56 - Some of you still don't have your eyebrows back\\
57 - from your last secret project.\\
58 - I can do both.\\
59 - All right, just as long\\
60 - as you know where your priorities are.\\
61 - I can go now.\\
62 - Did you see her necklace? I used to think she was so boring,\\
63 - but now that she's bi-curious, she's just\\
64 - so much, I don't know, cooler.\\
65 - Oh, my God, that is so true.\\
66 - She's, like, totally changed personalities\\
67 - since she's been wheat-free.\\
68 - Oh, and have you heard?\\
69 - Mark is totally out of that swing thing,\\
70 - which is so over, and into goth...\\
71 - Oh,  On the Road.\\
72 - I read that. It's a really good book.\\
73 - That's Travis. He has angst.\\
74 - Look at all these people.\\
75 - They're pierced, they're brooding.\\
76 - They're wearing weird clothes.\\
77 - They don't care about anything.\\
78 - It's like a room full of Francises.\\
79 - Okay, people...\\
80 - We're doing act three, scene two.\\
81 - Oberon! Puck!\\
82 - Where's my Puck?\\
83 - I think he has a wrestling meet.\\
84 - Hey, you.\\
85 - Changeling Boy.\\
86 - Can you read? Yeah.\\
87 - You got half these kids beat.\\
88 - Read Puck for the day.\\
89 - Page 27.\\
90 - "This is thy negligence.\\
91 - "Still thou mistak'st\\
92 - "Or commit'st thy knaveries willfully.\\
93 - "Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.\\
94 - "Did not you tell me I should know the man\\
95 - "by the Athenian garments he had on?\\
96 - "And so far blameless proves my enterprise.\\
97 - "That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes.\\
98 - And so far..."\\
99 - You went from a part with no lines\\
100 - to the lead in the high school play?\\
101 - Oh, that's great.\\
102 - It's not a musical, is it?\\
103 - No. That's great.\\
104 - Dude, you play a fairy?\\
105 - Not just any fairy, Reese.\\
106 - He's the biggest fairy in the whole play.\\
107 - I am so proud of you.\\
108 - Rehearsals are every night.\\
109 - You have to get me there by 5:00.\\
110 - Every night?\\
111 - Oh, yeah, we build sets on the weekends.\\
112 - Okay, we can do this. If I go into work early,\\
113 - I can get off in enough time to drop you off at rehearsal\\
114 - before I take Reese to hockey--\\
115 - except the days Reese has detention.\\
116 - And then Dewey's home alone.\\
117 - I'll take care of it.\\
118 - I can rearrange my schedule for a couple weeks.\\
119 - It'll be fun spending some time together.\\
120 - Can we run over things in the car\\
121 - like we did last time? Da-da-shh...\\
122 - It was already dead.\\
123 - Hmm, this is your best guacamole yet, Joe.\\
124 - Thanks. The secret is fresh lime juice. Yeah.\\
125 - Commandant on the floor.\\
126 - No, no...\\
127 - Please don't let me disturb you.\\
128 - Make yourselves at home.\\
129 - Wait a minute.\\
130 - This is not your home.\\
131 - This is not your mama's house.\\
132 - There's no maid here\\
133 - to clean up your toys,\\
134 - and, yet, as I look around this institution of learning,\\
135 - I see video games, I see girlie magazines.\\
136 - And I see Garth...\\
137 - Garth Vader defiling our Wall of Remembrance.\\
138 - Well, clearly things have gotten a little lax around here.\\
139 - I blame myself, but it is you who will suffer.\\
140 - From now on, there will be weekly inspections.\\
141 - And you will relinquish all non-standard-issue\\
142 - personal effects and artwork.\\
143 - It is time for you to learn that true happiness\\
144 - comes from within.\\
145 - Is that why you're so happy, sir?\\
146 - I'm as giddy as a schoolgirl, Cadet.\\
147 - Okay, spaghetti,\\
148 - toilet cleaner, glitter for Malcolm's costume...\\
149 - I think that's it.\\
150 - Oh, my God, is that right?\\
151 - What time do you have?\\
152 - Uh, 5:45.\\
153 - 5:45?\\
154 - That's not possible. I...\\
155 - dropped off Malcolm, picked up Reese.\\
156 - Dinner's in the oven.\\
157 - Huh.\\
158 - What is it?\\
159 - I have the next 25 minutes free.\\
160 - How did you manage that?\\
161 - Did you leave a kid somewhere?\\
162 - No, no, they're, they're all accounted for.\\
163 - What are you going to do?\\
164 - I don't know.\\
165 - Huh? Yeah, um...\\
166 - I don't know.\\
167 - So this goes here?\\
168 - Yeah, and that should do it.\\
169 - Hey, these were in English.\\
170 - This is nice.\\
171 - Never looks like the box when I do it alone.\\
172 - Me either.\\
173 - We make a good team.\\
174 - All right.\\
175 - You start on Main Street.\\
176 - I'll do University Place\\
177 - and we'll meet at the bistro, say... noon-ish?\\
178 - Would you like a massage?\\
179 - Oh, I don't know.\\
180 - I'm really not a massage person.\\
181 - It only takes 15 minutes.\\
182 - Well...\\
183 - I do have some time to kill.\\
184 - I am not taking off my shirt.\\
185 - And I'm warning you, I've never been hypnotized.\\
186 - And I've never been relaxed.\\
187 - Hmm.\\
188 - That actually feels...\\
189 - ...feels...\\
190 - pretty good.\\
191 - "Pleading for a lover's fee\\
192 - "Shall we their fond pageant see?\\
193 - "Lord, what fools these mortals be!"\\
194 - I am very upset with you, Malcolm.\\
195 - You've made me care again.\\
196 - Malcolm, that was terrific.\\
197 - God, I'd give anything to be as good as you.\\
198 - I mean, if you're this good now,\\
199 - imagine how amazing you're going to be when you're 15.\\
200 - And think of how cute he's going to be when he's 15.\\
201 - Oh, my God. Did I just giggle?\\
202 - Did you just...\\
203 - giggle?\\
204 - Stevie, what are you doing here?\\
205 - You missed...\\
206 - the meeting.\\
207 - You're jeopardi...\\
208 - zing...\\
209 - our project.\\
210 - Great. See you in class.\\
211 - I wonder if I could just go straight to high school?\\
212 - I've been told skipping grades stunts you socially,\\
213 - but I think I've been lied to.\\
214 - But, sir, that's a photo of my sister.\\
215 - To you she's your sister.\\
216 - To the other cadets she's a... distraction.\\
217 - Now, if you need me to go into more detail on that,\\
218 - I will.\\
219 - How long are those sideburns, Cadet?\\
220 - This is crazy.\\
221 - Even prisoners can have photographs.\\
222 - Spangler's trying to take away the things that remind us\\
223 - we're still human.\\
224 - Francis, don't rock the boat.\\
225 - I don't care anymore.\\
226 - It's time to take a last desperate stand\\
227 - for individuality and freedom!\\
228 - - Malcolm! Reese! - Get a move on!\\
229 - Oh, good God, Hal,\\
230 - when are you going to clean this up?\\
231 - Malcolm! Reese! Let's go!\\
232 - Honey, I promised Dewey I'd spend time with him.\\
233 - This must have cost a fortune.\\
234 - Oh... we'll talk about this later.\\
235 - Some of us have places to be!\\
236 - So, Dewey, I'm thinking our little community\\
237 - can use a school.\\
238 - Don't need it.\\
239 - Everyone's born smart.\\
240 - Oh, that's beautiful, son.\\
241 - It's a utopia.\\
242 - And anyone stupid will be ground up for food.\\
243 - Ah...\\
244 - a cannibal utopia.\\
245 - Interesting.\\
246 - Oh, you're still here?\\
247 - I was just doing some shopping\\
248 - and I thought while I was here,\\
249 - you know, I'd, I'd stop over and say "hi."\\
250 - Oh, my God.\\
251 - How do you do that?\\
252 - Release points.\\
253 - This one releases the mind.\\
254 - This one releases the heart.\\
255 - And you know what this one does.\\
256 - Wow.\\
257 - We need... to talk.\\
258 - You've missed our last five secret meetings,\\
259 - and our test-run's in less than 20 minutes.\\
260 - Why do you hate us?\\
261 - Guys, I don't hate you.\\
262 - I've just been really busy.\\
263 - We're still friends.\\
264 - Really?\\
265 - Of course.\\
266 - So, you're not bailing on the project?\\
267 - No. Then you have the final figures?\\
268 - Yeah, I worked on them all night after rehearsal.\\
269 - They're in my desk.\\
270 - Here.\\
271 - It was the other kids who doubted you.\\
272 - Hey, Malcolm...\\
273 - You need a ride?\\
274 - I got to go.\\
275 - Come on, get in.\\
276 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
277 - Hey.\\
278 - She's distracted.\\
279 - We have to do it now.\\
280 - The program is running.\\
281 - Let's light this candle.\\
282 - Ignition...\\
283 - in...\\
284 - five...\\
285 - four...\\
286 - three...\\
287 - Yeah!\\
288 - Blast off.\\
289 - Its trajectory seems rather peculiar.\\
290 - Okay, there are any number of reasons\\
291 - why that might have gone wrong.\\
292 - Where... is it?\\
293 - Take cover!\\
294 - I work hard, too.\\
295 - But I manage to make it to the Lamaze class.\\
296 - We had a vote. We want you to get rid of the plant.\\
297 - You're going to get us all in trouble\\
298 - with this little stunt of yours.\\
299 - This isn't a stunt.\\
300 - It's an act of defiance.\\
301 - It's a plant.\\
302 - Can't you see this isn't about a plant?\\
303 - It's about fighting tyranny, fascism and oppression.\\
304 - When Spangler sees this, he'll know\\
305 - that he didn't crush our spirit and he never will.\\
306 - It's not worth the risk.\\
307 - Once again, it looks\\
308 - like I'm the only man around here.\\
309 - I can't believe Nicole's wearing a dress like that.\\
310 - You can totally see her navel.\\
311 - If she wants to be a slut, that's fine,\\
312 - but don't make me lose my lunch. I know.\\
313 - She's, like, totally trying to impress David,\\
314 - but the way he's all up in Brenda's business,\\
315 - she didn't have a chance.\\
316 - I can't believe how deep our conversations are getting.\\
317 - You're never gonna believe\\
318 - what I heard about Josh, but you can't tell anyone.\\
319 - I overheard his stepsister while I was in the bathroom.\\
320 - His half-sister or stepsister?\\
321 - No, his stepsister.\\
322 - That's why he can have a crush on her.\\
323 - Ew. Ew.\\
324 - They were just talking about me, weren't they?\\
325 - No. We were talking about Josh.\\
326 - Oh, my God. His father, like, totally went down\\
327 - after catching him in the hot tub\\
328 - with his stepsister, but you know what?\\
329 - I don't even think he knows the whole story.\\
330 - Whoops, that's my cue.\\
331 - I feel guilty having so much fun at ditching the Krelboynes,\\
332 - but I'm sure they're doing fine without me.\\
333 - You boys are just lucky no one called the police.\\
334 - You can't prove there's any correlation\\
335 - between our rocket exploding\\
336 - and Caroline giving birth in the parking lot.\\
337 - She and the baby are fine.\\
338 - Thanks for asking.\\
339 - And the... rocket?\\
340 - Oh, God, then it's true.\\
341 - It's finished.\\
342 - A perfect society.\\
343 - We have done what 5,000 years of so-called civilization couldn't do.\\
344 - We've created a world that works.\\
345 - "We"?\\
346 - You want to destroy it, don't you?\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Well, I appreciate that you haven't.\\
349 - You've shown a lot of restraint.\\
350 - Here.\\
351 - Enjoy.\\
352 - Oh, honey, uh, look, I know we got a little carried away,\\
353 - but this is it, I promise.\\
354 - That's okay. I'm going grocery shopping.\\
355 - Didn't you just go grocery shopping?\\
356 - Yeah, sure. No problem.\\
357 - Thank you. Where's Mr. Li?\\
358 - Excuse me?\\
359 - The massage guy. Where is he?\\
360 - Oh. He's not working here anymore.\\
361 - What do you mean?\\
362 - That's impossible.\\
363 - He would never leave without telling me.\\
364 - Well, I could try to find out where he moved to.\\
365 - So he could leave me again?\\
366 - Forget it! It's over!\\
367 - I heard John has a new piercing.\\
368 - I'll give you three guesses where,\\
369 - and it's not the ear or belly button.\\
370 - Well, Julie would know. She went camping with him\\
371 - when her boyfriend was out of town.\\
372 - John takes all the girls camping and he tries\\
373 - to convince them to go skinny-dipping with him,\\
374 - but I think seeing John naked would turn me off guys forever.\\
375 - Oh, you know what we should totally do?\\
376 - We should totally have a pool party at my house on Saturday.\\
377 - Malcolm, want to come? Yeah. Wait.\\
378 - I have something to do on Saturday.\\
379 - Oh, yeah, the play.\\
380 - Live, live, die.\\
381 - Live, live,\\
382 - live, live, die.\\
383 - Hey, what happened to the judicial system\\
384 - presided over by a tribunal of wise elders?\\
385 - I had 'em lined up and shot.\\
386 - Ah.\\
387 - You know, son,\\
388 - maybe you've been spending too much...\\
389 - Silence!\\
390 - Seize him!\\
391 - All right, son, I think it's time\\
392 - you goose-stepped off to bed.\\
393 - Dad! You're embarrassing me in front of my men.\\
394 - Hal! Why is this still here?!\\
395 - Ow.\\
396 - No fair! You did it without me?\\
397 - Spangler's coming. Lose the plant.\\
398 - Time has come. We're drawing the line.\\
399 - This is our Alamo.\\
400 - Well, that's a bad example,\\
401 - but you know what I mean.\\
402 - Ten-hut!\\
403 - This is more like it.\\
404 - Everything shipshape.\\
405 - The commanding officer enters\\
406 - and is greeted by straightened backs\\
407 - and the crack of shoe leather.\\
408 - Now I know it's been a rough couple of days,\\
409 - but you will agree, we are the better for it.\\
410 - We are a lean, mean\\
411 - learning machine.\\
412 - Now, I know that some of you think that I'm a sadist,\\
413 - but someday you will thank me.\\
414 - Man, that's brutal.\\
415 - Is there anything we can do to cheer you up?\\
416 - Do you have any more pictures of your sister?\\
417 - I give him curses, yet he gives me love.\\
418 - O that my prayers could such affection move!\\
419 - Hal, please, stop.\\
420 - You're making it worse.\\
421 - The more I love, the more he hateth me.\\
422 - His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\\
423 - You okay, sport?\\
424 - You can play no part for Pyramus\\
425 - for Pyramus is a proper man as one shall see\\
426 - in a summer's day.\\
427 - Therefore you must...\\
428 - Why are we here?\\
429 - Malcolm betrayed us.\\
430 - If you love something, let it go.\\
431 - Save your cat poster philosophy for someone else.\\
432 - We're taking... the high road.\\
433 - We will meet and there we may...\\
434 - But you were totally scamming together?\\
435 - No. We were just smacking.\\
436 - She claims she was just "hanging out" with Andrew\\
437 - at the party, but they were really hooking up.\\
438 - I can't believe she would...\\
439 - Enough. Hold, or cut both strings.\\
440 - Was that my cue? Quick, lower me.\\
441 - Oh, my God, that is so true.\\
442 - Think of how cute he's going to be...\\
443 - You can totally see her navel.\\
444 - If she wants to be a slut, that's fine,\\
445 - but don't make me lose my lunch.\\
446 - I'm totally not calling her back until she apologizes.\\
447 - By being her friend, I enable her assy behavior.\\
448 - This must be one of those times where it feels like an eternity\\
449 - but only a few seconds have gone by.\\
450 - How come Malcolm hasn't said anything for five minutes?\\
451 - Line.\\
452 - Normally, I would enjoy the  schadenfreude,\\
453 - but this is just sad.\\
454 - Psst.\\
455 - How now, spirit? Wither wander you?\\
456 - How now, spirit?\\
457 - Wither wander you?\\
458 - Ew!\\
459 - Who is that kid?\\
460 - The King doth keep his revels here tonight.\\
461 - The King doth keep his revels here tonight.\\
462 - So, good night unto you all.\\
463 - Give me your hands if we be friends\\
464 - and Robin shall restore amends.\\
465 - It's over?\\
466 - But you promised me partial nudity.\\
467 - Yeah, that was a lie.\\
468 - And the ice cream after?\\
469 - That, too.\\
470 - How now, spirit?\\
471 - Wither wonder you?\\
472 - The King doth keep his revels here tonight.\\
473 - I knew I knew it!\\
474 - Take heed the Queen come not within his sight\\
475 - for Oberon is passing fell and wrath\\
476 - because that she, as her attendant, hath a lovely boy\\
477 - stolen from the Indian king;\\
478 - She never had so sweet a changeling.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Bully}
1 - Hey, guys. What you doing?\\
2 - Hup!\\
3 - I wish he could stay little forever.\\
4 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
5 -     I don't know    \\
6 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     And you're not so big    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     Life is unfair.    \\
16 - Reese finally found a way to beat the snot out of people\\
17 - and actually get a trophy for it.\\
18 - When's Reese up? I think he's next.\\
19 - Ooh!\\
20 - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yee-hee!\\
21 - You're Reese's parents?\\
22 - Why?\\
23 - He's incredible. I was at the last meet.\\
24 - His match was the turning point.\\
25 - He inspired the whole team.\\
26 - And?\\
27 - Nothing.\\
28 - He's great.\\
29 - Thank... you.\\
30 - We're still getting used to this whole\\
31 - being proud of Reese thing.\\
32 - Go team!\\
33 - Thank you, Braveheart.\\
34 - Where's Reese? Shouldn't he be warming up?\\
35 - Reese! You're up next.\\
36 - Let's go.\\
37 - Go, Reese.\\
38 - All right, who's up?\\
39 - Uh-oh.\\
40 - Well, that's not fair.\\
41 - What do they expect him to do--\\
42 - beat up a girl?\\
43 - I get to beat up a girl.\\
44 - Cool.\\
45 - Go, Reese!\\
46 - Two points.\\
47 - One point.\\
48 - Two points.\\
49 - Come on, Reese!\\
50 - Let's go, son!\\
51 - Kill her!\\
52 - Warning.\\
53 - Come on, ref!\\
54 - Stop! Warning!\\
55 - Kill him!\\
56 - Aah!\\
57 - Ow! Aah!\\
58 - Ow! Ow!\\
59 - Ow!\\
60 - Is Reese a girl now?\\
61 - No, Dewey. He's a lady.\\
62 - Shut up!\\
63 - Sorry, ma'am.\\
64 - All right, that's enough.\\
65 - Reese lost a wrestling match.\\
66 - It's no big deal-- sometimes you win,\\
67 - sometimes you don't.\\
68 - Yeah, son, you have nothing to be ashamed of.\\
69 - You did your best.\\
70 - That girl was just inarguably a better wrestler than you.\\
71 - Oh, my God, she had you flopping around on that mat\\
72 - like a rag doll.\\
73 - Hello.\\
74 - Hold him down!\\
75 - You, shave his butt.\\
76 - Mom, I'm calling to remind you that today is the last day\\
77 - to buy me a plane ticket home for my...\\
78 - birthday.\\
79 - Honey, we talked about this.\\
80 - We can't fly you back here in the middle of the week.\\
81 - You'd only be here for eight hours.\\
82 - But, Mom... Sweetie, I'm sorry.\\
83 - I wish things were different,\\
84 - but you were just home for Thanksgiving,\\
85 - and that's all we can afford right now.\\
86 - Mom, you don't know what they do to people around here on their\\
87 - birthday.\\
88 - They strip you naked,\\
89 - and they shave every hair off your body\\
90 - and they throw you in the reflecting pond.\\
91 - Is that what you want for me?\\
92 - I'm impressed, Francis.\\
93 - Your stories are getting better; at least more believable.\\
94 - What stories?\\
95 - Oh, when you wanted to come home for that party\\
96 - and you swore the academy was being terrorized\\
97 - by a pack of feral dogs?\\
98 - Which were never caught.\\
99 - Francis, I want you home for your birthday, too,\\
100 - but we just can't afford it.\\
101 - Fine. I guess I'll just fend for myself\\
102 - and hope these monsters don't find out it's my...\\
103 - you know.\\
104 - He's still got an eyebrow!\\
105 - Get him!\\
106 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
107 - I heard about your brother last night.\\
108 - It was hilarious.\\
109 - You didn't see it?\\
110 - A sporting... event?\\
111 - Right. I wonder what it's like\\
112 - to get beat up by a girl.\\
113 - It's totally humiliating.\\
114 - You just want to die.\\
115 - Your brother didn't soil himself, did he?\\
116 - No.\\
117 - Neither did I.\\
118 - You know...\\
119 - Reese's embarrassing defeat could have\\
120 - serious consequences for us all.\\
121 - He'll be working extra hard\\
122 - to prove he's still on top of the food chain.\\
123 - You're saying we could actually have a meaner,\\
124 - more vicious Reese on our hands?\\
125 - It's very possible.\\
126 - We can't avoid the beatings,\\
127 - but I suggest that, as a wedgie deterrent,\\
128 - we go without underwear for the next several days.\\
129 - Uh-oh.\\
130 - Here he comes now.\\
131 - This is the first time I've ever been happy to be me.\\
132 - You want something to look at?\\
133 - I'll give you something to look at.\\
134 - The old chocolate milk diversion.\\
135 - Wish I had thought of that.\\
136 - Okay, what the hell was that milk thing on the playground?\\
137 - I don't know. I had to do something.\\
138 - So you poured milk on yourself?\\
139 - Why didn't you just pound that kid?\\
140 - Because I'm sick of doing that.\\
141 - I'm sick of beating up little kids.\\
142 - It's creepy.\\
143 - But that's you-- that's what you do.\\
144 - Not anymore.\\
145 - That was the old me.\\
146 - The thing I did at school today\\
147 - was me destroying the old Reese.\\
148 - So, drenching yourself with chocolate milk\\
149 - was like a baptism?\\
150 - No, idiot.\\
151 - I was washing away the old me and starting over.\\
152 - You know, you've been acting really weird\\
153 - ever since you got your butt kicked by that girl.\\
154 - It's not just about the girl.\\
155 - Wrestling made me feel good, you know?\\
156 - I was helping the school.\\
157 - People looked up to me.\\
158 - And that's gone now, and I've got nothing.\\
159 - But it's not going to be like that anymore.\\
160 - I'm going to find a way to make people proud of me again.\\
161 - So what are you going to do?\\
162 - I don't know.\\
163 - I just want to be the good guy,\\
164 - do good stuff...\\
165 - for good.\\
166 - Dewey, what can I do for you?\\
167 - Mom! Shut up!\\
168 - I'm trying to help you.\\
169 - Hi, sweetie.\\
170 - What's wrong?\\
171 - Is it Francis?\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - He keeps calling.\\
174 - His stupid stories are touching, in a way.\\
175 - You know, he just wants to come home.\\
176 - It's the first time he's been away on his birthday.\\
177 - Well, maybe we can at least do something that night\\
178 - to take our minds off it.\\
179 - A guy at work won these concert tickets on the radio.\\
180 - Jimmy Buffett?\\
181 - He didn't want them. Can you imagine?\\
182 - Hello.\\
183 - Mom, great news. I figured out a way to get home Wednesday.\\
184 - Francis...\\
185 - No, it won't cost you a cent.\\
186 - One of the cadet's fathers is a trucker.\\
187 - He said I can ride in the refrigerator compartment\\
188 - to the 609 interchange. And a buddy of his\\
189 - flies a crop duster. Now, if he's sober,\\
190 - he should be able to drop me off at the soybean field\\
191 - near the train station...\\
192 - Honey, Francis, come on.\\
193 - There'll be other birthdays.\\
194 - Ask him if he wants a T-shirt from the concert.\\
195 - What concert?\\
196 - Uh, your father\\
197 - got us tickets to see Jimmy Buffett.\\
198 - And this concert wouldn't happen\\
199 - to be on Wednesday night, would it?\\
200 - My birthday?\\
201 - Uh, yes, it is, but that has nothing to do...\\
202 - Oh, now I get it.\\
203 - You can't afford to bring me home, but somehow\\
204 - you find money for Jimmy Buffett tickets.\\
205 - Francis, that's not the way it is at all.\\
206 - They were free tickets. Sure they were.\\
207 - A friend of your father's gave them to us.\\
208 - He's not really a friend.\\
209 - You know, you guys should really\\
210 - get your stories straight before you try to ditch me on my...\\
211 - birthday.\\
212 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
213 - Want my cake? You're not hungry?\\
214 - No. I ate my lunch and  my decoy lunch.\\
215 - Now that Reese isn't stealing it anymore, I get both.\\
216 - And Reese hasn't made me eat grass for a week.\\
217 - Everything tastes better.\\
218 - Life... is good.\\
219 - I've been taking ballet, and I don't care who knows it.\\
220 - Good for you.\\
221 - Two days ago, Reese would've creamed that kid.\\
222 - Things are really changing.\\
223 - It's like we've entered an age of enlightenment.\\
224 - It's kind of nice.\\
225 - Hey!\\
226 - Hey.\\
227 - What was that for?\\
228 - That's for having a smart mouth\\
229 - and making fun of me all the time.\\
230 - Since Reese is out of the picture,\\
231 - I don't have to take it anymore.\\
232 - What are you talking about?\\
233 - Now that your brother's a wuss,\\
234 - I don't have to worry about him coming after me\\
235 - when I teach you a lesson.\\
236 - But we're friends.\\
237 - Making cracks about me painting my face\\
238 - and being stupid?\\
239 - You say those things to  friends?\\
240 - Those things were funny.\\
241 - Oh, yeah. Real funny.\\
242 - I'll show you what's funny.\\
243 - Knock, knock. Who's there?\\
244 - Pushy Pusherson.\\
245 - What's wrong with him?\\
246 - Remember me? Moby Rick?\\
247 - That was so hilarious.\\
248 - I never called you Moby Rick.\\
249 - I called you Rick-Oppotamus.\\
250 - Although...\\
251 - Hey! Hey!\\
252 - Just wait for a second.\\
253 - So you guys really don't think I'm funny?\\
254 - Well, you learn something new every day.\\
255 - Evidently, I'm not as charming as I thought.\\
256 - You know, you really make us feel bad\\
257 - with your hurtful comments. Yeah.\\
258 - You know I'm insecure about my taste in clothes,\\
259 - yet you continue to make cutting remarks about my outfits.\\
260 - Yeah!\\
261 - You walk around acting all smart and funny,\\
262 - but did you know I cry myself to sleep every night?\\
263 - Ye... You do?\\
264 - So the only reason those jerks have been putting up with me\\
265 - is because they're afraid of my brother?\\
266 - Actually, we're a bit tired of your act, too.\\
267 - Those guys are nuts. I'm funny.\\
268 - Aren't I funny?\\
269 - To be honest, you  can  be a little caustic.\\
270 - The word... is arrogant.\\
271 - How about bitter, sarcastic and handsome?\\
272 - Hey, she's cute.\\
273 - Hey, Jeffrey.\\
274 - Do you need help crossing the street?\\
275 - Don't worry, I'm nice now.\\
276 - Come on.\\
277 - Jeffrey!\\
278 - How many times have I told you\\
279 - to stay out of that street?\\
280 - Oh! You are in so much trouble,\\
281 - young man!\\
282 - Hello?\\
283 - Yeah.\\
284 - I'm here to read to you.\\
285 - Okay.\\
286 - I was so glad\\
287 - when I heard you were coming.\\
288 - Really? Great.\\
289 - I just want to help.\\
290 - They said the terminal patients\\
291 - really get a lift from this kind of stuff.\\
292 - I'm sorry, did... did you say "terminal"?\\
293 - I'm in the wrong room.\\
294 - And come to think of it, I'm in the wrong hospital.\\
295 - Nurse!\\
296 - Nurse!\\
297 - Help! Help! Let me go!\\
298 - Happy birthday, Murphy.\\
299 - We've been looking for you for hours.\\
300 - Oh, please! Hey!\\
301 - Hey, my grandmother sent me a comforter!\\
302 - Take my comforter!\\
303 - You won't believe how soft it is! Ow!\\
304 -     Happy birthday to you    \\
305 -     Happy birthday to you    \\
306 -     Happy birthday, dear Murphy...    \\
307 - Oh, for God's sake, be careful.\\
308 - Oops.\\
309 - Oh, my God!\\
310 - I wish I could say this was\\
311 - the stupidest thing I've ever done.\\
312 - You know, on top of everything, they're going to make me\\
313 - fix the window when I get back.\\
314 - Don't be so hard on yourself.\\
315 - You have every right to be upset.\\
316 - I can't believe your parents\\
317 - are leaving you all alone on your birthday.\\
318 - You poor thing.\\
319 - Well, it isn't that bad.\\
320 - Yes, it is.\\
321 - Yeah, I guess you're right.\\
322 - You know, this is going to be my first birthday without a cake.\\
323 - You know what?\\
324 - You're not going to spend your birthday alone.\\
325 - You're coming to my place,\\
326 - and I'm going to make you a nice dinner.\\
327 - No.\\
328 - Why should you have to bother with me\\
329 - just 'cause I'm injured and... all alone?\\
330 - I'll even make you a cake. What kind do you...\\
331 - German chocolate.\\
332 - What's wrong?\\
333 - Ugh, I don't know, Hal.\\
334 - I guess this whole Francis thing is still bothering me.\\
335 - Yeah, me, too.\\
336 - Hey, you know what?\\
337 - Why don't we do something extra nice for him?\\
338 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened to you?\\
339 - What happened to me? I'll tell you what happened to me.\\
340 - Since Reese got whipped by that girl,\\
341 - he stopped being the school bully,\\
342 - so now there's no one to protect me from people\\
343 - who think I'm an unfunny little smart ass,\\
344 - which is evidently everyone.\\
345 - Well, you can be a little sarcastic.\\
346 - Thanks, Dad. I feel better.\\
347 - Case in point.\\
348 - Well, he  can  be.\\
349 - I'll go talk to him.\\
350 - Rough day, huh?\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - You know, when people are mad at you,\\
353 - a simple apology can take you a long way.\\
354 - Let me give you a hypothetical.\\
355 - Let's just say, hypothetically,\\
356 - I told a coworker that it looked like my boss\\
357 - was highlighting his hair.\\
358 - And let's say, hypothetically,\\
359 - that the coworker then went to my boss\\
360 - and told him what I said\\
361 - and that, hypothetically speaking,\\
362 - my boss then moved me to the tiny office\\
363 - at the end of the hall, next to the copier.\\
364 - And if I had just apologized, Malcolm,\\
365 - you boys would all have your own bedrooms right now.\\
366 - So you're saying you wish you had apologized?\\
367 - Not to that pretty boy.\\
368 - Look, this hypothetical\\
369 - has nothing to do with your situation.\\
370 - Just think about it.\\
371 - Okay, I'll be over at 8:00.\\
372 - Yeah, feels much better.\\
373 - All right. Bye.\\
374 - Heard you got a hot date.\\
375 - Nah, just a nurse... with her own place.\\
376 - No biggie.\\
377 - You're a lucky man, Francis.\\
378 - You got a way with the ladies,\\
379 - you got parents who love you...\\
380 - What are you talking about?\\
381 - Hey, whose birthday is it?\\
382 - According to the card, it's yours.\\
383 - Wow.\\
384 - My family finally sent me a present, eight months late.\\
385 - Which is...\\
386 - ironic\\
387 - 'cause my mom works at the post office.\\
388 - Started back in '87.\\
389 - Used to be a letter sorter.\\
390 - Okay, how about right here?\\
391 - Hey.\\
392 - What do you want?\\
393 - I just wanted to talk.\\
394 - What?\\
395 - I just want to say I'm sorry.\\
396 - About what?\\
397 - Remember the day it was raining\\
398 - and you said, "Hey, it's raining,"\\
399 - and I said, "Thanks, Einstein"?\\
400 - Yeah. Why'd you say that?\\
401 - My name's not Einstein.\\
402 - I was referring to Albert Einstein.\\
403 - He was this physicist who was a genius.\\
404 - You think I'm a genius?\\
405 - Oh, man, I've got, like, five good comebacks to that.\\
406 - But that was the old me.\\
407 - No, I was being sarcastic.\\
408 - I was kind of saying that you're the opposite of a genius.\\
409 - So... you were calling me stupid.\\
410 - Yeah, and that's why I...\\
411 - I'm really glad we had this talk, Malcolm.\\
412 - Yeah, I feel a lot better now, too.\\
413 - Hey, Malcolm, come here.\\
414 - I finally figured it out.\\
415 - I found the answer.\\
416 - I know what I want to do with my life.\\
417 - Are you still selling those video games?\\
418 - Yeah. Five bucks.\\
419 - What are you doing?\\
420 - Selling my material possessions.\\
421 - Why?! 'Cause Brother Billy told me to.\\
422 - Brother Billy?!\\
423 - You mean that nut who rides around in the school bus\\
424 - handing out pamphlets?\\
425 - It's called a manifesto.\\
426 - And he is not a nut once you stop and listen to him.\\
427 - He and his followers have this awesome compound in Oregon\\
428 - where we're going to live off the land.\\
429 - You're going off with this guy?!\\
430 - Don't worry, it is totally safe.\\
431 - They have guard dogs, watchtowers...\\
432 - Do Mom and Dad know about this?\\
433 - No, and you can't tell them.\\
434 - Brother Billy says they have negative energy and bad karma.\\
435 - You're talking about joining a cult.\\
436 - Are you nuts?\\
437 - Brother Billy doesn't talk to me like that.\\
438 - He makes me feel good about myself.\\
439 - It's called brainwashing, Reese.\\
440 - My name isn't Reese anymore.\\
441 - Then what is it?\\
442 - I don't remember, but it isn't Reese.\\
443 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
444 - I have manifestos to distribute.\\
445 - Reese, you've got to help us.\\
446 - What?\\
447 - Your absence as a bully has created a power vacuum.\\
448 - Now the school is filled with rogue thugs\\
449 - carving out random spheres of influence.\\
450 - I've been hit up for my lunch money twice today.\\
451 - I've been hit up three times,\\
452 - and when I didn't have anything,\\
453 - they took my shirt!\\
454 - They took my shoes!\\
455 - My shoes!\\
456 - But what am I supposed to do about it?\\
457 - We need you back.\\
458 - What do you mean? I was a jerk.\\
459 - Yes, but you were the alpha jerk.\\
460 - Reese, without you,\\
461 - it's anarchy!\\
462 - Look around you.\\
463 - Give me those.\\
464 - Don't you see?\\
465 - The whole school needs you back\\
466 - administering your unique form\\
467 - of evenhanded brutality.\\
468 - You're saying my being a bully's a good thing?\\
469 - Yes! You're our only hope.\\
470 - Stop it!\\
471 - Stop it!\\
472 - I'm...\\
473 - immune.\\
474 - I'm... immune!\\
475 - Hey! Stevie's off limits!\\
476 - He  used  to be.\\
477 - Get out of my way.\\
478 - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...\\
479 -     The Hulkster's in the house    \\
480 -     Check him out, check him out    \\
481 -     Get up off your seat...    \\
482 - Thanks... Reese?\\
483 - Starting tomorrow, you're back doing my book reports.\\
484 - Sure.\\
485 -     Hey, hey, oh, oh, come on    \\
486 -     Let's go    \\
487 -     Hey, hey, oh, oh, come on...    \\
488 - Reese! Reese! Reese! Reese!\\
489 -     When the going gets tough    \\
490 -     The tough get rough    \\
491 -     Hey, hey, oh, oh, come on, let's go.    \\
492 - Let go of me!\\
493 - Oh, okay, I'm going, I'm going.\\
494 - Order... is restored.\\
495 - You have the tickets?\\
496 - Mm-hmm.\\
497 - Do you think Francis liked his cookie basket?\\
498 - Oh, I bet he was thrilled.\\
499 - It was a thoughtful idea, hon.\\
500 - I just hope his friends gave him a party.\\
501 - I'm sure they did.\\
502 - They seem like nice boys.\\
503 - So, how's that reflection pond, Francis?\\
504 - Cold.\\
505 - And when's your date?\\
506 - In 20 minutes.\\
507 -     Hey, now, baby          Hey, now, baby     \\
508 -     Hey, now, honey child          Hey, now, honey child     \\
509 -     Hey, now, baby          Hey, now, baby     \\
510 -     Hey, now, honey child...          Hey, now, honey child...     
\subsection {Episode 11: Old Mrs Old}
1 - Look at that.\\
2 - Ch...\\
3 - Ch?\\
4 - Che...\\
5 - Check?\\
6 - Check.\\
7 - M...\\
8 - Maaa... ate?\\
9 - Checkmate?\\
10 - Checkmate! So it is.\\
11 - See, it just goes to show you.\\
12 - Yes, well, good game, son.\\
13 - Lois!\\
14 - Hey, he lets me win at basketball.\\
15 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
16 -     I don't know    \\
17 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     Life is unfair.    \\
27 - All right, spin around twice, hit the ball\\
28 - on the second bounce.\\
29 - It's two points for a car\\
30 - and three for a fire hydrant.\\
31 - It's an out if they catch it\\
32 - and two if they hit you with the ball.\\
33 - Now, if they miss, it's a "google,"\\
34 - which I'll explain when we get there.\\
35 - You're up.\\
36 - It's amazing.\\
37 - Reese can't pass math,\\
38 - but he's invented over, like, 50 games.\\
39 - Fun games.\\
40 - Okay, spin!\\
41 - I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.\\
42 - Not Mrs. Griffin's yard.\\
43 - There it is.\\
44 - Dude, she doesn't like anybody in her yard.\\
45 - I'll be in and out of there before she knows it, right?\\
46 - Just because she's old and mean\\
47 - doesn't give her the right to keep our balls.\\
48 - I'm sold. Go for it.\\
49 - Fine, I'll do it.\\
50 - It's no big deal.\\
51 - I don't see you moving.\\
52 - What are you doing in my yard?\\
53 - Let go! It's my ball!\\
54 - My property, my ball!\\
55 - Who said you could come into my yard?\\
56 - Ow! What are you doing?!\\
57 - Choose, boy!\\
58 - Hair or ball?!\\
59 - You broke her arm?\\
60 - I was getting a ball.\\
61 - You broke her arm for a ball?\\
62 - No, I already had the ball, then I pushed her away.\\
63 - You pushed her and broke her arm for a ball?\\
64 - Was it a special ball, son?\\
65 - It was just a flat old tennis ball.\\
66 - Sometimes I don't know why he does the things he does.\\
67 - At least she's not suing us.\\
68 - You just be thankful we have\\
69 - absolutely nothing of value in this house.\\
70 - Count your blessings, son.\\
71 - I talked to Mrs. Griffin.\\
72 - This is what's going to happen.\\
73 - You are going to go there every day after school\\
74 - and help that poor old woman until her arm heals.\\
75 - Every day?\\
76 - Not one word! Every day.\\
77 - End of story.\\
78 - Hello?\\
79 - Hey, Ma, listen,\\
80 - did you happen to talk to Richie's mom recently?\\
81 - Yeah, as a matter of fact I did.\\
82 - I ran into her at work the other day.\\
83 - Did you happen to talk about Richie at all?\\
84 - Oh, that poor woman.\\
85 - Do you know how much grief\\
86 - that boy is putting her through?\\
87 - I told her if she had a brain in her head,\\
88 - she'd pack him off to military school and straighten him out\\
89 - before he got into serious trouble.\\
90 - Okay, thanks. Got to go.\\
91 - Well, it wasn't her.\\
92 - I need a new backpack.\\
93 - Again? How do you keep ruining them? I don't know.\\
94 - Well, I'm not buying you another backpack.\\
95 - You just find something in the closet.\\
96 - Okay.\\
97 - Okay, maybe it's a good thing that I'm doing this.\\
98 - I'm not saying I'm completely to blame,\\
99 - but in a way I am responsible.\\
100 - I guess I  was  trespassing, and I did hip-check her.\\
101 - And who knows, maybe she won't be that bad.\\
102 - Maybe she'll be like a grandma--\\
103 - well, not like  my  grandma-- like a nice grandma.\\
104 - Hi, I'm Malcolm.\\
105 - I'm the kid who broke your arm.\\
106 - I'm really sorry.\\
107 - Here, fill this up.\\
108 - I'm not having any druggies in my house.\\
109 - God, she's like a homeless person,\\
110 - and this house is her shopping cart.\\
111 - Get out of the way, you damn ugly beast.\\
112 - What'd you do, stupid?\\
113 - What? Does this look like a rubber band jar to you?\\
114 - This  is a rubber band jar.\\
115 - Are you ignorant or just stupid?\\
116 - Neither. There's no such thing...\\
117 - Did you finish moving my papers?\\
118 - Almost.\\
119 - Do you read all these?\\
120 - What, are you writing a book?\\
121 - Just move 'em.\\
122 - What are you?\\
123 - What, like how old?\\
124 - No, what are you?\\
125 - Polack? Swede?\\
126 - Apache?\\
127 - I really don't know.\\
128 - Uh-huh, a mutt.\\
129 - Well, whatever you are, stay away from my liquor.\\
130 - Look, it's almost 5:00, I'm going to get going soon.\\
131 - Really?\\
132 - I didn't realize my arm stopped being broken at 5:00.\\
133 - What am I going to do for dinner?\\
134 - Can't you just order take-out?\\
135 - I'm not giving those Mexicans my money.\\
136 - They're as bad\\
137 - as that Lithuanian that fixed my screens.\\
138 - Boy, did he love ice cubes.\\
139 - Those 'Wanians and their ice cubes.\\
140 - I can't believe how horrible she is.\\
141 - I'm just going to ignore her.\\
142 - But you just try and get those people\\
143 - to pay for anything.\\
144 - Oh, he got his special ice.\\
145 - I suppose you're Dutch.\\
146 - You got eyes like a Dutchman--\\
147 - real pinny.\\
148 - You got those pinny Dutch eyes.\\
149 - What's that? My new backpack.\\
150 - Dewey, that's not a backpack; that's Mom's purse.\\
151 - Now, go back and get something else. No.\\
152 - Dewey, you're wearing an invitation to an ass-kicking.\\
153 - I like it. Look... I don't think you understand.\\
154 - Kids like me are dreaming about something like this.\\
155 - We look around the playground and we see\\
156 - normal kid, normal kid, and a kid with a purse.\\
157 - Who do you think's going to get creamed?\\
158 - Is one of the normal kids fat?\\
159 - It doesn't matter!\\
160 - He's going to be fat every day.\\
161 - Now, the kid with the purse, he might not wear it again.\\
162 - I don't care. I like it.\\
163 - Give me that! No!\\
164 - You don't know what these animals are capable of!\\
165 - Let go!\\
166 - I'm trying to protect you!\\
167 - Richie, what are you doing?\\
168 - We have inspection.\\
169 - You can't sleep all morning.\\
170 - Dude... not cool.\\
171 - Richie,\\
172 - this isn't like home.\\
173 - You can't do whatever you want.\\
174 - These guys are hard-core.\\
175 - And also, there are some crappy flat pillows.\\
176 - Who do I talk to about that?\\
177 - Ten hut!\\
178 - Stand up.\\
179 - Pajamas, Cadet?\\
180 - Sir, I'm sorry for my fellow cadet's appearance.\\
181 - He's fresh from civilian life\\
182 - and is taking a little time to adjust.\\
183 - Hey, are you the dude who hands out the guns?\\
184 - And you can see\\
185 - he's very anxious to assimilate himself\\
186 - into our military lifestyle.\\
187 - What's your name, Cadet?\\
188 - Richie. Pleasure.\\
189 - Listen closely, Cadet.\\
190 - This is not going to be easy for you.\\
191 - Your family sent you here\\
192 - because you couldn't handle it at home.\\
193 - Maybe you were coddled.\\
194 - Well, there is no coddling here.\\
195 - You make a mistake\\
196 - and you will be punished.\\
197 - Be aware, Cadet, I am keeping my eye on you.\\
198 - Good one.\\
199 - Pardon?\\
200 - You're keeping your eye on me.\\
201 - You know, you got only one eye.\\
202 - Like Popeye.\\
203 - I think it's cool that you're cool with it.\\
204 - That's amusing.\\
205 - I've never heard that before.\\
206 - Carry on.\\
207 - Popeye.\\
208 - Quite amusing.\\
209 - Is he like our butler or something?\\
210 - I can't close my eyes.\\
211 - Every time I do, I see what was under that robe\\
212 - on the inside of my eyelids.\\
213 - I can't go back there.\\
214 - Malcolm, why aren't you over at Mrs. Griffin's?\\
215 - She said she doesn't need me anymore.\\
216 - There's some new medicine.\\
217 - It's good for old people's bones.\\
218 - She has a lot of pride.\\
219 - I think it bothers her when I'm over there.\\
220 - I am so sorry.\\
221 - That's all right.\\
222 - I'm sure, when I was his age,\\
223 - I wouldn't want to hang around\\
224 - with some old person whose arm I had broken.\\
225 - You're a mean, thoughtless little boy.\\
226 - Trying to make an old woman\\
227 - suffer more than she already has.\\
228 - Yes, ma'am.\\
229 - You're a nasty little liar, aren't you?\\
230 - Well, liar, you're the one that's going to suffer\\
231 - as soon as we pick up my prescription and get home.\\
232 - Ooh, damn cast itches like a Greek sailor.\\
233 - Stop pawing at me!\\
234 - Hey, Dewey.\\
235 - You know what?\\
236 - I've been thinking.\\
237 - You know how I never give you anything\\
238 - for your birthday?\\
239 - Yeah...\\
240 - Well, here.\\
241 - Happy birthday!\\
242 - I already have a backpack.\\
243 - Not like this one.\\
244 - See, this one has a whistle.\\
245 - Why are you flinching?\\
246 - I'm giving you something nice.\\
247 - But I'm not going to take it.\\
248 - Here, just hold it. No.\\
249 - Why won't you let me do something nice?!\\
250 - I don't want it!\\
251 - You're going to wear this\\
252 - and there's nothing you can do about it!\\
253 - Dad, you have to do something about Dewey\\
254 - taking Mom's purse to school.\\
255 - Don't worry, son, it's just a phase.\\
256 - Aren't you worried about how this reflects on you as a parent?\\
257 - Reese, one boy's purse is another boy's book bag...\\
258 - if he's European.\\
259 - Besides, I can't tell you how many times\\
260 - I've been jealous of your mother and her purse.\\
261 - You know, we men have to shove our whole lives\\
262 - in a little square of leather that we then have to sit on.\\
263 - I'm not saying that I condone it,\\
264 - but I am saying, let Dewey have his purse.\\
265 - Perhaps he'll blaze a trail for the rest of us.\\
266 - I don't think these new pills are working.\\
267 - I keep taking them\\
268 - and I don't feel anything.\\
269 - Don't be stingy with that lotion.\\
270 - You're going to need a knife when you get to the corns.\\
271 - If I didn't know any better,\\
272 - I'd say that new doctor was Hungarian.\\
273 - Dr. Freeman.\\
274 - Freeman.\\
275 - Ha.\\
276 - If that's not an Ellis Island hand-me-down,\\
277 - I'll eat my Sunday hat.\\
278 - I don't think you're supposed to take\\
279 - those pills with alcohol.\\
280 - Ooh, now you're worried about me.\\
281 - Where was that when you broke this arm?\\
282 - You're just like that...\\
283 - that nosy Kraut cleaning lady of mine.\\
284 - Your hands are similar, too.\\
285 - Small.\\
286 - Like a girl's.\\
287 - Okay, that's enough.\\
288 - You're a horrible person\\
289 - and I hate you!\\
290 - I know I'm not supposed to hate people,\\
291 - but if anybody should be hated, it's you!\\
292 - It's a good thing you called us.\\
293 - How long has she been like this?\\
294 - Hours.\\
295 - She passes out for awhile, wakes up, takes more pills,\\
296 - and passes out again.\\
297 - Pernabutol. What's the dosage?\\
298 - Hundred milligrams, two by three.\\
299 - She taking Fermatram with that?\\
300 - I doubt it.\\
301 - That's been contraindicated since '87.\\
302 - No, this seems like a pretty straightforward alcohol/sedative reaction.\\
303 - Absolutely.\\
304 - If she's anything like my mom,\\
305 - Mrs. Griffin will be knocked loopy\\
306 - for the next three and a half hours.\\
307 - We're completely unsupervised.\\
308 - Are you thinking\\
309 - what I'm thinking?\\
310 - Is this what  you were thinking?\\
311 - Not even remotely.\\
312 - I was thinking more along the lines of...\\
313 - Why doesn't he have to cut his hair?\\
314 - I don't know.\\
315 - Why does Spangler let him wear a bathrobe to class?\\
316 - I don't know.\\
317 - Maybe he saved Spangler's life.\\
318 - He didn't save Spangler's life.\\
319 - Well, it's got to be something, because it's just not right.\\
320 - Richie.\\
321 - Take a quarter from me.\\
322 - Thanks, Chief.\\
323 - No problem, Richie.\\
324 - You guys talking about Spangler's son?\\
325 - He's not Spangler's son.\\
326 - I grew up with him. He's a screwup.\\
327 - He's a slack dumbass who lives in his mother's basement.\\
328 - It's got to be Spangler.\\
329 - He must be mellowing.\\
330 - Sir!\\
331 - Sir!\\
332 - Cadets.\\
333 - What's up, Chief?\\
334 - I've been onto you from the start.\\
335 - Not once did you pull any wool\\
336 - over this boy's eyes.\\
337 - You come in here, put a paper lantern around a lightbulb\\
338 - and, lo and behold, you're the Queen of the Nile.\\
339 - I say ha!\\
340 - I've always depended\\
341 - on the kindness of strangers.\\
342 - Stella! Stella!\\
343 - Whoo! Yeah!\\
344 - That was great!\\
345 - What's next?\\
346 - I have no idea.\\
347 - We've done everything we can do in this house.\\
348 - It can't be over. Come on, think.\\
349 - With our brains and your gift for reckless, antisocial behavior\\
350 - there's got to be something else we can do.\\
351 - I've never felt more alive.\\
352 - We're outlaws. Whoo!\\
353 - This rocks!\\
354 - Hey, I think 45 minutes of rubbing out corns\\
355 - is worth at least an hour joyride.\\
356 - At the best, you ignored us.\\
357 - At the worst, you tormented us.\\
358 - Now, the tables have turned.\\
359 - The Krelboynes are mobile.\\
360 - Behold our derring-do!\\
361 - What?\\
362 - What's going on?\\
363 - She saw me. She saw me.\\
364 - I am so dead.\\
365 - We're all dead.\\
366 - I'm not going to get into a good college.\\
367 - Mom is going to kill me.\\
368 - We should just end this.\\
369 - We should drive off a cliff, like Thelma and Louise.\\
370 - Why does everything end in a group suicide with you?\\
371 - Okay, okay. Stop panicking.\\
372 - Let's all just calm down, and think about this, okay?\\
373 - Okay, first of all, I don't think she saw you guys.\\
374 - So there's no reason we all should get in trouble, and...\\
375 - Guys?\\
376 - Stevie, want some help?\\
377 - Pop... the trunk.\\
378 - Entrez.\\
379 - Sir, it's about Richie. Is he all right?\\
380 - He's more than all right, he's in heaven.\\
381 - Don't you think you've been letting him slide a little?\\
382 - Yes. You're letting him get away with murder.\\
383 - I certainly am.\\
384 - Are you aware that he thinks\\
385 - he's immune to any punishment?\\
386 - That he can do whatever he wants?\\
387 - I am, and he can.\\
388 - Sir...\\
389 - are you just messing with my head?\\
390 - It's not always about  you,  Cadet.\\
391 - Well, then, what is it?\\
392 - Francis, I'm not an idiot.\\
393 - Don't you think that I know Richie is a moron?\\
394 - Hell, he is a cancer.\\
395 - He is a cancer to be eradicated.\\
396 - If Richie's attitude spread to the other cadets,\\
397 - there's no telling what it would do to Marlin.\\
398 - What do you mean? You're treating him like a god.\\
399 - And that makes the other cadets furious, doesn't it?\\
400 - It makes them want to hurt him...\\
401 - to hurt your little friend?\\
402 - Wait a minute... you're turning us against him.\\
403 - You want us to get rid of Richie ourselves.\\
404 - Bravo, Cadet.\\
405 - You see, every threat to Marlin must be treated differently.\\
406 - You, Francis, had to be beaten down, like a dog.\\
407 - Richie is being killed with kindness...\\
408 - or at least pummeled into unconsciousness.\\
409 - Oh, that is pretty clever, sir.\\
410 - But what makes you think I won't just tell Richie\\
411 - about your plan?\\
412 - Oh, feel free.\\
413 - But I don't think you will.\\
414 - He's my best friend. Why wouldn't I tell him?\\
415 - Because you hate him, too.\\
416 - You're resentful of all the special privileges\\
417 - that he gets-- the expensive dinners,\\
418 - the use of the Academy golf cart...\\
419 - the way he gets shiatsu massages\\
420 - when the rest of you are suffering\\
421 - through survival training.\\
422 - That doesn't matter.\\
423 - Of course I would tell him.\\
424 - I would be a traitor if I didn't.\\
425 - You would be, wouldn't you?\\
426 - Richie...\\
427 - No time to talk, man.\\
428 - Wait, this is important.\\
429 - Dude, watch it.\\
430 - This shirt was a gift from Edwin.\\
431 - It cost 200 bucks.\\
432 - Richie, I'm trying to tell you something.\\
433 - Well, you'd better say it quick.\\
434 - Edwin'll freak if I'm late for the match.\\
435 - We've got early dinner reservations.\\
436 - You know what?\\
437 - It can wait.\\
438 - Fine.\\
439 - No, wait.\\
440 - I have to tell you this.\\
441 - You're my friend, and I owe it to you.\\
442 - Spangler is only being nice to you\\
443 - so that we all hate you and beat the snot out of you.\\
444 - I can't believe it.\\
445 - I know.\\
446 - You're jealous of me and Edwin being buds,\\
447 - so you're trying to shove a wedge between us.\\
448 - That's sad, man.\\
449 - Just remember I told you.\\
450 - Whatever, man.\\
451 - Sour grapes.\\
452 - But I told you.\\
453 - Whatever.\\
454 - Hey, dudes, cool hoods.\\
455 - Ow!\\
456 - Think! Think!\\
457 - I'm a genius.\\
458 - I can think of something.\\
459 - Why can't I think of something?\\
460 - Where you been, car thief?\\
461 - Come back to steal my jewelry?\\
462 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
463 - It was a horrible mistake.\\
464 - I don't know why I would do something so stupid,\\
465 - but I did and I'm sorry.\\
466 - Oh, my God, my mom's here.\\
467 - What am I going to do?\\
468 - You're a good lady. You're a good person.\\
469 - Please, if you have any shred of decency\\
470 - you'll give me a five-second head start\\
471 - so I can head towards Mexico.\\
472 - Please, I'm begging you.\\
473 - You don't know what she's capable of.\\
474 - Malcolm, get your things. We're going home.\\
475 - I am so sorry for all of this.\\
476 - Sorry for what?\\
477 - My son stole your car...\\
478 - and he was out joyriding in it.\\
479 - Joyriding?\\
480 - That was no joyride for me.\\
481 - I was passed out in the backseat.\\
482 - What?\\
483 - I made a mistake\\
484 - with my medication, and he drove me to the hospital.\\
485 - Huh?\\
486 - He was driving you to the hospital?\\
487 - Yes, who else is going to do it?\\
488 - I'm just an old woman. I live alone.\\
489 - Malcolm, when there's an emergency,\\
490 - you should come to  us.\\
491 - Yeah, you're right.\\
492 - I don't know what I was thinking.\\
493 - Because I wasn't thinking\\
494 - and I just did it.\\
495 - I'm sorry.\\
496 - And I... yeah.\\
497 - Well, it was pretty quick thinking.\\
498 - He's a good boy.\\
499 - I don't know what I would have done without him.\\
500 - Thanks.\\
501 - In fact, he's so kind...\\
502 - he offered to come help me  before  school\\
503 - every day, too.\\
504 - Before school?\\
505 - Really?\\
506 - I thought that was too much, too.\\
507 - Especially since these old bones heal  so slowly...\\
508 - it'll be months.\\
509 - But he insisted.\\
510 - Didn't you?\\
511 - Yeah.\\
512 - Ooh, these corns are burning.\\
513 - You'd better go get the lotion.\\
514 - Well, I'll leave you to your work.\\
515 - Guess you won't be coming home for supper.\\
516 - And to think, I was all ready to punish you.\\
517 - Don't just stand there, thief.\\
518 - Let's go.\\
519 - Hey!\\
520 - Here's your stupid backpack back.\\
521 - What's up with the flower field?\\
522 - Hey, Percy, I love your purse.\\
523 - It's for his own good.\\
524 - It's a book bag.\\
525 - It's a girl's purse.\\
526 - That makes you a girl.\\
527 - No, it doesn't.\\
528 - Are you calling me a liar?\\
529 - Aah! Get him!\\
530 - Nice!
\subsection {Episode 12: Krelboyne Girl}
1 - Give me that.\\
2 - It never gets old.\\
3 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
4 -     I don't know    \\
5 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     And you're not so big    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     Life is unfair.    \\
15 - Mom, what are you doing?\\
16 - For crying out loud, Malcolm,\\
17 - why am I paying for underpants that you're not wearing?\\
18 - Mom.\\
19 - Why are you not wearing your underpants?\\
20 - I want to wear boxers.\\
21 - Oh, really?\\
22 - Well, you may think\\
23 - you suddenly need all the extra room,\\
24 - but let me tell you, my dear,\\
25 - you are getting way ahead of yourself.\\
26 - Just once, I'd like a childhood memory I don't have to repress.\\
27 - Do you think maybe Dewey's\\
28 - getting a little old for stuffed animals?\\
29 - Maybe we should start thinking about weaning him off Domingo.\\
30 - I guess that part of his childhood is over.\\
31 - So sad.\\
32 - Our little baby is growing up.\\
33 - Give me that.\\
34 - Hey,\\
35 - check out the new kid.\\
36 - Fresh...\\
37 - meat.\\
38 - You no longer have to live in fear.\\
39 - What are you talking about?\\
40 - The hazing we put you through is over.\\
41 - What hazing?\\
42 - Oh, come on.\\
43 - When we gave you the warped lunch tray?\\
44 - When we dulled the points on your pencils?\\
45 - When you sneezed and no one said "Bless you"?\\
46 - I still feel bad about that.\\
47 - Now she's taking your place as the whipping boy.\\
48 - You know, you guys get dumped on and tortured\\
49 - by the entire school.\\
50 - Why would you want to do it to someone else?\\
51 - You guys don't even know this girl. Maybe she's nice.\\
52 - Hi.\\
53 - I'm Malcolm.\\
54 - Cynthia.\\
55 - So, you're new here.\\
56 - Yeah... my dad wanted to get away from Manhattan,\\
57 - but I think the real reason is\\
58 - that my mom's remarriage hit him pretty hard\\
59 - and he thinks that a new environment would help.\\
60 - The truth is, nothing's been the same\\
61 - since my brother died in the boating accident.\\
62 - Just kidding.\\
63 - What?\\
64 - Get... a room.\\
65 - Anyway, I'll see you later\\
66 - and I'm glad your brother's okay.\\
67 - I don't have a brother.\\
68 - Cadets, apparently one of you felt the compelling need\\
69 - to take my '37 Stutz Bearcat for a joyride in a cornfield.\\
70 - You may be sure the responsible party\\
71 - will be disciplined.\\
72 - Now, I know\\
73 - in the past I have resorted to grueling midnight hikes\\
74 - through leech- infested swamps\\
75 - or the repetitive digging and filling of ditches,\\
76 - et cetera, et cetera.\\
77 - But things have changed.\\
78 - Due to a recent court decision\\
79 - involving corporal punishment,\\
80 - a loophole has allowed me to unretire "Old Hickory."\\
81 - Mmm. He hungers for the sting\\
82 - of insolent flesh.\\
83 - Hi, Dad.\\
84 - Oh, hey, son. What's up?\\
85 - I need a little favor.\\
86 - Oh, I'll try. What do you need?\\
87 - An alibi. If anyone asks, you just have to say\\
88 - we were on a father-son fishing trip yesterday.\\
89 - What did you do?\\
90 - Really, Dad,\\
91 - do the specifics matter?\\
92 - I mean, you have to do this for me.\\
93 - I am not going to lie for you.\\
94 - Okay, I'm calling in my chit.\\
95 - What chit? You know, the one-time thing.\\
96 - I just call it in and you do it, no questions asked.\\
97 - That doesn't exist, Francis. Dad.\\
98 - No, I'm sorry, son, I can't help you.\\
99 - You're gonna have to face the consequences\\
100 - of your actions like a grown-up.\\
101 - All I have to say is, I am very disappointed in you.\\
102 - Was that Francis?\\
103 - How's he doing?\\
104 - Good. He... he, uh...\\
105 - just got a "B" on his history final.\\
106 - Good for him.\\
107 - You know, this is the longest he's ever gone\\
108 - without getting into any kind of trouble.\\
109 - Maybe things are finally starting to turn around.\\
110 - So, why are you here so late?\\
111 - I had to use the school computer.\\
112 - Why are you here so late?\\
113 - I really liked what you said in class\\
114 - about the search for intelligent life in the universe.\\
115 - And you waited out here to tell me that?\\
116 - You know, I was thinking,\\
117 - why are we even bothering\\
118 - to send signals into deep space?\\
119 - If we do make contact with extraterrestrials,\\
120 - we'll probably just wind up doing their laundry.\\
121 - Just kidding.\\
122 - So, what's it like having a brother?\\
123 - I don't know.\\
124 - Well, I've got to go home now. Bye.\\
125 - Bye.\\
126 - What's going on?\\
127 - Some weird new girl from school\\
128 - actually followed me home.\\
129 - Really? Is she cute?\\
130 - Hey, is this what that whole boxer shorts thing is all about?\\
131 - Mom, please don't.\\
132 - Hi.\\
133 - Thank you again for inviting me.\\
134 - Oh, you're welcome.\\
135 - If my son weren't such\\
136 - an unforgivably rude little pig,\\
137 - he would have invited you himself.\\
138 - You be nicer to her.\\
139 - She obviously has no friends at all.\\
140 - Malcolm, would you ask your girlfriend\\
141 - to pass the potatoes?\\
142 - Malcolm, would you thank your girlfriend for me?\\
143 - So, Cynthia, you're in Malcolm's class.\\
144 - Yeah.\\
145 - Huh.\\
146 - Malcolm, would you ask your girlfriend\\
147 - if she would like some peas?\\
148 - We get it.\\
149 - Thank you, Mr. Chicken, for giving up your life\\
150 - so that I can continue to live.\\
151 - What are you doing?\\
152 - I know if someone killed me and ate me,\\
153 - I'd like them to at least say thank you.\\
154 - Hello.\\
155 - This is Commandant Spangler from the Marlin Academy.\\
156 - Oh, yes.\\
157 - Sorry to disturb you.\\
158 - I'm just calling because\\
159 - we had an incident up here last weekend,\\
160 - and I've done a thorough investigation,\\
161 - and it appears your son Francis\\
162 - is a prime suspect.\\
163 - Well, that's impossible\\
164 - because he was with me last weekend.\\
165 - He was?\\
166 - Yes. Yes, we went fishing.\\
167 - You're sure?\\
168 - Smallmouth bass.\\
169 - Boy, those babies'll fight you.\\
170 - Yeah, I got the fish to prove it.\\
171 - You know, I should send you some.\\
172 - No, that's quite all right.\\
173 - No, I insist.\\
174 - Yeah, I got a freezer full of 'em.\\
175 - Okay, where's Domingo?\\
176 - Come on, I can smell him.\\
177 - Honey, do you think\\
178 - I just took Domingo away from you\\
179 - because I'm mean?\\
180 - Absolutely.\\
181 - Dewey, the reason\\
182 - I had to take your teddy bear away\\
183 - is because he's very dirty.\\
184 - He's covered with germs\\
185 - and he could make you very sick.\\
186 - He wouldn't do that.\\
187 - He loves me.\\
188 - It's the germs, sweetie.\\
189 - There're tiny bugs carrying disease,\\
190 - and Domingo is covered with them.\\
191 - Now, when you touch him, they get on your hands,\\
192 - and what do you suppose happens if you touch your eyes?\\
193 - Well, I'll tell you what happens.\\
194 - The germs get in there and they infect them,\\
195 - and you get very sick\\
196 - and eventually your optic nerve rots away\\
197 - and your eyes fall out.\\
198 - Now, if you want to keep Domingo, you can.\\
199 - But if you want to keep your eyes, you'll give Domingo to me.\\
200 - You made the smart choice, sweetie.\\
201 - Sleep tight.\\
202 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
203 - I want to sit alone.\\
204 - Yeah, hi.\\
205 - So, I signed us up as lab partners.\\
206 - You know, Cynthia,\\
207 - you're spending all your time with me.\\
208 - Maybe it'd be a good thing\\
209 - if you branched out a little bit?\\
210 - Just seemed like a good idea.\\
211 - We get along so well,\\
212 - I just thought we've got a good thing going.\\
213 - "Thing"?\\
214 - Ooh, Malcolm,\\
215 - having lunch with your girlfriend?\\
216 - She's not my girlfriend.\\
217 - Oh, I don't know.\\
218 - I think I see a spark.\\
219 - Boop.\\
220 - Please don't touch me.\\
221 - Yeah, that'll work.\\
222 - Oh, she doesn't like to be touched.\\
223 - Well, then, maybe I'll do this. Ow!\\
224 - Now, say your body is composed entirely of snot.\\
225 - My body is composed entirely of snot.\\
226 - Anything you want to add? I'm good.\\
227 - What was that?\\
228 - It's Krav Maga--\\
229 - the official self-defense system of the Israeli army.\\
230 - Maybe I'll show you sometime\\
231 - if you think you can handle it.\\
232 - What's with all the fish?\\
233 - Oh, nothing, I just did something incredibly stupid\\
234 - and shortsighted.\\
235 - You going to put those in the freezer?\\
236 - Just for tonight.\\
237 - Tomorrow they go in the mail.\\
238 - Dewey, what are you doing?\\
239 - I'm killing the germs.\\
240 - I hate germs.\\
241 - Germs are scary.\\
242 - Don't forget the germs in the oven.\\
243 - Hello.\\
244 - You are the best dad ever.\\
245 - I am not.\\
246 - I'm a terrible dad.\\
247 - I never should've lied for you.\\
248 - Well, the important thing is that this is all behind us\\
249 - and I've learned my lesson.\\
250 - What lesson is that?\\
251 - That you are the best dad ever.\\
252 - You know, Francis, I don't feel much like talking right now.\\
253 - Yes, Commandant Spangler,\\
254 - this is Francis' father.\\
255 - I'm-I'm afraid I... lied to you.\\
256 - Francis is the cadet responsible for damaging your car.\\
257 - I see.\\
258 - Well, that puts me in somewhat of an awkward position.\\
259 - You see, the culprit is being disciplined as we speak.\\
260 - But Francis did it.\\
261 - You-You're punishing the wrong cadet.\\
262 - I beg your pardon.\\
263 - In my 30 years at this academy\\
264 - I have never caned the wrong cadet.\\
265 - Sir, did you say "caned"?\\
266 - No.\\
267 - Sir...\\
268 - Consider the matter closed.\\
269 - But, sir, you...\\
270 - Take five, fellas.\\
271 - Yeah, we're having lunch together.\\
272 - So what?\\
273 - She likes to sit next to me.\\
274 - Looks like Lloyd and Dabney are having\\
275 - a pretty intense conversation.\\
276 - Did you know I could read lips?\\
277 - "I've noticed that 80% of my Doritos\\
278 - are isosceles triangles."\\
279 - "Wow, I'm impressed.\\
280 - Want to kiss?"\\
281 - "I was hoping you'd ask.\\
282 - Let me finish my sandwich first."\\
283 - "Waiting is such sweet agony."\\
284 - "Okay, I'm ready."\\
285 - "Oh, now I'm not.\\
286 - I just took a bite of my sandwich."\\
287 - "Oh, you're such a tease."\\
288 - Now, if I apply pressure like this for ten seconds,\\
289 - you'll pass out.\\
290 - If I do it for 20 seconds,\\
291 - you'll die of a brain hemorrhage.\\
292 - Cool.\\
293 - Okay.\\
294 - Are you wearing perfume?\\
295 - Oh, it's my shampoo.\\
296 - Jasmine. Do you like it?\\
297 - Well, yeah. It smells good.\\
298 - It's supposed to get rid of my dandruff,\\
299 - but I'm not sure it's working.\\
300 - Here, what do you think?\\
301 - Malcolm?\\
302 - Ooh.\\
303 - Looks like you and Cynthia have some real chemistry.\\
304 - Would you shut up?\\
305 - No, see, it-it's a play on words.\\
306 - I said shut up.\\
307 - I'll e-mail it to you\\
308 - and some others, if you don't mind.\\
309 - So, have you figured out how many words\\
310 - your phone number makes?\\
311 - Mine makes five:\\
312 - Three in English and two in Esperanto.\\
313 - Just kidding.\\
314 - You know, if it's a joke\\
315 - you don't have to say "just kidding."\\
316 - It's either funny or it isn't.\\
317 - You know, just because you're cute\\
318 - doesn't mean you can be rude.\\
319 - That wasn't rude.\\
320 - That was...\\
321 - What's a...?\\
322 - Did she say I was cute?!\\
323 - Hi, Malcolm. What's going on?\\
324 - I just wanted to talk to you\\
325 - about something that's bothering me.\\
326 - What's it about?\\
327 - There's this girl, and...\\
328 - Keep Mom out of it!\\
329 - What?!\\
330 - I am warning you,\\
331 - keep Mom out of your love life.\\
332 - Mom has nothing to do with this.\\
333 - Trust me-- yes, she does.\\
334 - She will ruin it, I swear.\\
335 - Whatever Mom tells you, don't do it.\\
336 - And don't do the opposite, either!\\
337 - The way it's worked for me is...\\
338 - Actually, it's never worked for me.\\
339 - I just don't know if it's a good idea.\\
340 - I've thought about this a long time.\\
341 - Okay, it's your call.\\
342 - When are you going to talk to Dewey?\\
343 - As soon as he finishes the windows.\\
344 - Hey! I want a rematch.\\
345 - Last time the sun was in my eyes,\\
346 - and I wasn't really...\\
347 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
348 - What are you doing after school?\\
349 - We're getting a dog, and I thought you\\
350 - might want to help us pick one out.\\
351 - My mom wants a golden retriever,\\
352 - but I'm leaning more toward\\
353 - a flat-coated retriever...\\
354 - because everyone has goldens, and...\\
355 - I don't want to be lab partners with you anymore.\\
356 - What?\\
357 - I mean, it wasn't my idea.\\
358 - The teacher thought I should partner up with someone else.\\
359 - Okay.\\
360 - Hello, son.\\
361 - Dad, what are you doing here?\\
362 - I need to talk to you.\\
363 - You drove eight hours just to talk to me?\\
364 - Well, I thought it best that I do this face- to-face, man-to-man.\\
365 - What is it?\\
366 - Francis, you wrecked Commandant Spangler's car\\
367 - and you weren't punished for it.\\
368 - Another cadet was, and that just isn't right.\\
369 - That's what you came all the way down here to tell me?\\
370 - Well, that, and your mother said\\
371 - you can come home from military school,\\
372 - and I told her I didn't think it was a good idea.\\
373 - What?! Francis,\\
374 - neither one of us did the right thing,\\
375 - and there has to be consequences for that.\\
376 - Oh, come on!\\
377 - Look, if I didn't do this\\
378 - I'd be failing you as a parent.\\
379 - There's got to be another way.\\
380 - No, no, believe me.\\
381 - I wrestled with this on the drive over.\\
382 - This is the only fair thing to do\\
383 - because it deals with my complicity as well.\\
384 - Guess there really isn't anything more to say.\\
385 - Well, looks like you have some kind of activity planned,\\
386 - so I'll get out of your hair.\\
387 - Hey.\\
388 - I love you, son.\\
389 - Have fun.\\
390 - Dewey, we have got to talk.\\
391 - Honey, when I talked to you about germs,\\
392 - I was just trying to scare you.\\
393 - That was wrong.\\
394 - This isn't about germs.\\
395 - Sweetie, it's about growing up.\\
396 - The reason I had to take Domingo\\
397 - away from you is because\\
398 - you are too grown-up\\
399 - for a ratty, old stuffed animal\\
400 - that's falling apart.\\
401 - Dewey, you have got to stop this.\\
402 - It's a little bug. It never hurt anyone.\\
403 - But it has germs on it!\\
404 - Okay, this is enough.\\
405 - See?\\
406 - Nothing happened to me.\\
407 - Okay?\\
408 - Okay.\\
409 - So take off the plastic and go eat your breakfast.\\
410 - So, anyway...\\
411 - Look at her, talking to some idiot.\\
412 - Who is that guy?\\
413 - What am I saying? I don't care.\\
414 - Why should I care?\\
415 - There's nothing that special about her.\\
416 - Why is this bugging me so much?\\
417 - If I'm such a genius\\
418 - I should be able to come up with a smart way to deal with this.\\
419 - Why did you throw a brick\\
420 - through my daughter's window at 2:00 in the morning?\\
421 - I don't know.\\
422 - I really don't.\\
423 - How could you do that?\\
424 - It really scared me, Malcolm.\\
425 - I don't know, I'm sorry. The one good thing is,\\
426 - Mom'll kill me before this goes on for too much longer.\\
427 - I didn't move to the suburbs\\
428 - so my daughter could be attacked in the dead of night.\\
429 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
430 - He wasn't attacking her. He's got a crush on her.\\
431 - Beg pardon?\\
432 - Mom, don't. Don't worry,\\
433 - Malcolm's going to be punished.\\
434 - But this is nothing to get panicked about.\\
435 - But... Don't you remember\\
436 - when you were his age-- all the dumb things\\
437 - you did with your little girlfriends?\\
438 - Um, I'm not his...\\
439 - It's puberty!\\
440 - Their bodies are going all crazy down there\\
441 - and they can't do anything about it.\\
442 - So they start all that silly making out\\
443 - and then they get all tingly and charged up\\
444 - and they don't know what to do with themselves\\
445 - so they throw bricks and things.\\
446 - My oldest son set a doghouse on fire.\\
447 - They are idiots at this age.\\
448 - That's just what they do.\\
449 - Yes, well... that-that may be,\\
450 - but this kind of behavior is not acceptable.\\
451 - No, it isn't... but you'd better get used to it\\
452 - because I'm gonna tell you right now,\\
453 - this one is an early bloomer.\\
454 - She's gonna pop out of every bra you buy\\
455 - for the next three years.\\
456 - You're going to be self-conscious,\\
457 - but don't let it make you slouch.\\
458 - You're gonna be happy about it when you get to college.\\
459 - Come on...\\
460 - I'll give you the number of a glass company.\\
461 - We give him a lot of business.\\
462 - He'll treat you right.\\
463 - Well, at least she didn't strip us and take pictures.\\
464 - The night is young.\\
465 - Okay, you know what?\\
466 - Big deal.\\
467 - I do like you.\\
468 - I'm willing to say it.\\
469 - I really like you a lot.\\
470 - I like you a lot.\\
471 - Okay, then...\\
472 - What?\\
473 - I'm not all tingly\\
474 - and charged up, okay?\\
475 - Nah. Me neither.\\
476 - And my body's not going crazy.\\
477 - Fine.\\
478 - God, why'd she have to say all that stuff?\\
479 - Malcolm, what are you doing?\\
480 - Look, Cynthia, believe me, I'm trying to kiss you,\\
481 - and I think if you just give me a minute to clear my head,\\
482 - I'll be able to kiss you, okay?\\
483 - Excuse me?! Francis said she'd do this.\\
484 - And who, exactly, is Francis? It's not what you think.\\
485 - He's my brother. You were going to kiss me, and you're thinking\\
486 - about your brother? No, I was thinking about my mom.\\
487 - No, I mean, I was thinking about your bra.\\
488 - I mean... I was thinking about what's in your bra.\\
489 - Uh... I mean, what will be in your bra.\\
490 - Oh, can I start over?\\
491 - I wonder if I can convince anyone this is a hickey.
\subsection {Episode 13: New Neighbors}
1 - What you looking at?\\
2 - Reese's report card.\\
3 - It is much better than last time.\\
4 - Really?\\
5 - Yeah. This time he used\\
6 - the exact same brand of pen\\
7 - as the teacher to change his grade.\\
8 - Look at that.\\
9 - He gave himself a "C" in math\\
10 - instead of an A+.\\
11 - Yeah, it's subtle.\\
12 - Nice attention to detail.\\
13 - He's really learning.\\
14 - Two months grounded?\\
15 - Three months scrubbing toilets.\\
16 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
17 -     I don't know    \\
18 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     And you're not so big    \\
27 -     Life is unfair.    \\
28 - Feet.\\
29 - Hey!\\
30 - Ow!\\
31 - My sandwich!\\
32 - It's mine now.\\
33 - Moving van!\\
34 - We've got a moving van next door!\\
35 - Ooh, espresso-maker.\\
36 - Leather couch... I'm thinking upscale professional.\\
37 - Well, if they're living here,\\
38 - they haven't managed their money very well.\\
39 - Families keep moving in and out of that house.\\
40 - I wonder why.\\
41 - Whoa!\\
42 - Maybe the house is haunted.\\
43 - Table saw!\\
44 - No, Hal. No borrowing.\\
45 - We have a clean slate with these people.\\
46 - We're going to behave.\\
47 - I want to have one person on this earth\\
48 - who can pick up the mail.\\
49 - Your mother's right.\\
50 - Doesn't hurt to have allies on the block,\\
51 - especially allies with a pool.\\
52 - We just got to make sure we get to them\\
53 - before the Reeds can poison them against us.\\
54 - Or the McCartys.\\
55 - Or the Whitfords.\\
56 - We definitely need to get to them\\
57 - before the Whitfords.\\
58 - I see Mrs. Schneider circling.\\
59 - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!\\
60 - Ten-hut!\\
61 - When you men are done here,\\
62 - I expect to see each and every one of you\\
63 - on the parade ground\\
64 - practicing your close order drill.\\
65 - But, sir, we just did close order drill.\\
66 - Is that what that was?\\
67 - It looked like physical therapy at a head trauma ward.\\
68 - Sir, we've been cleaning and drilling for 36 hours.\\
69 - I think, by law, we're supposed to be allowed to sleep.\\
70 - Why are we doing this?\\
71 - Well, this was supposed to be a surprise,\\
72 - but I can no longer contain my excitement.\\
73 - Marlin Academy is about to be visited\\
74 - by one of the last living heroes.\\
75 - Gentlemen,\\
76 - Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North,\\
77 - United States Marine Corps, Retired, is coming here\\
78 - to give you a motivational speech.\\
79 - Sir, isn't he a convicted felon?\\
80 - That conviction was overturned.\\
81 - So was mine, but I'm still stuck here.\\
82 - Well, if you had a Bronze Star,\\
83 - a Silver Star, two Purple Hearts,\\
84 - and a nationally syndicated radio call-in show,\\
85 - then maybe you could have had\\
86 - a deal.\\
87 - But since you don't...\\
88 - you can shut your piehole!\\
89 - This is nice, Tina.\\
90 - You didn't have to barbecue.\\
91 - Well, you're the first neighbors\\
92 - to come by and say hello.\\
93 - Well, that's not surprising.\\
94 - I don't want to speak ill of anybody\\
95 - and I won't say who,\\
96 - but some of our neighbors are prone to paranoid fantasies.\\
97 - Oh, yeah, don't get me started on the stories.\\
98 - Hal... Yeah.\\
99 - So, what's there to do around here?\\
100 - Well, there's a pothole we like to jump with our bikes.\\
101 - They filled it.\\
102 - There's a dead squirrel we like to poke at.\\
103 - That should be good for a few more days.\\
104 - And there's always the dried-up creek\\
105 - and the flooded park.\\
106 - Boy, if it wasn't for that squirrel,\\
107 - my life would be really pathetic.\\
108 - Wait, wait, you, you only flipped 'em once?\\
109 - I feel every patty has a moment.\\
110 - See, I always rush it.\\
111 - Factor in the fat content, Hal.\\
112 - Hey, do you have a good doctor?\\
113 - Why, is something wrong?\\
114 - Well, neck pain.\\
115 - Or back pain.\\
116 - Whatever will get him to write the prescription.\\
117 - No, I'm sorry. My doctor's honest.\\
118 - Too bad.\\
119 - I'll let you know if I find one.\\
120 - I wouldn't stare at him like that. He'll get angry.\\
121 - No, he won't. He's friendly.\\
122 - Tell that to the kid he ate.\\
123 - What kid?\\
124 - That's why we had to move.\\
125 - Didn't you read about it in the newspaper?\\
126 - No.\\
127 - Just as well.\\
128 - Pictures were really gruesome.\\
129 - I did it. I did it!\\
130 - See? I told you you could.\\
131 - Can I have another burger? Malcolm spit on mine.\\
132 - What?\\
133 - Malcolm, why would you do such a thing? But I didn't...\\
134 - Yeah, yeah, here.\\
135 - There. Now beat it.\\
136 - Why are you staring at me?\\
137 - What, do you want a chip?\\
138 - Ow! Cut it out!\\
139 - Ow! What are you doing?!\\
140 - Stop it!\\
141 - I think there are some briquettes\\
142 - in one of these boxes.\\
143 - Is this heaven?\\
144 - Wow, look at this collection.\\
145 - Oh, Doobie Brothers, King Crimson.\\
146 - Oh, Cheap Trick... hello!\\
147 - You like vinyl?\\
148 - Oh, yeah.\\
149 - Check this out.\\
150 - Is that a Shirendorff 1280 turntable?\\
151 - 1290.\\
152 - Why did you say I spit on your burger?\\
153 - Don't worry about it.\\
154 - Want to see something funny?\\
155 - Hey, quit staring at my mom's chest.\\
156 - What? I'm not.\\
157 - Malcolm, knock it off! But I-I wasn't...\\
158 - Aah, get away from me!\\
159 - Aah! Get away from me!\\
160 - Your daughter is biting my son.\\
161 - Oh, no, they're just playing.\\
162 - Ow! It hurts! It hurts! Mommy!\\
163 - Now, honey, if you want to breathe,\\
164 - you're going to have to open your mouth and let go of my son.\\
165 - What are you doing?\\
166 - Just a little trick I picked up.\\
167 - How dare you touch my daughter.\\
168 - She was gnawing on my son.\\
169 - If you're not going to control her...\\
170 - Are you questioning my parenting?\\
171 - I don't know. I haven't seen it yet.\\
172 - How nice. This from a woman raising a pervert.\\
173 - Where was he supposed to look?\\
174 - You got 'em laid out like a couple eggs on a plate.\\
175 - I wasn't... Emily, Josh,\\
176 - I don't want you playing\\
177 - with these awful children anymore.\\
178 - Hey, my...! Well, they may be awful,\\
179 - but they're a hell of a lot better than your two brats.\\
180 -     Whoa! Cherokee People!    \\
181 -     Ow!    \\
182 -     Cherokee Tribe...    \\
183 - A little help?\\
184 - This is nice.\\
185 - Yeah. You know, you may not believe this,\\
186 - but you're the first neighbor friend I've ever had.\\
187 - No way. Yeah.\\
188 - In fact, you're the first guy who's ever been\\
189 - back here that didn't work for the power company.\\
190 - Actually, I have a confession to make.\\
191 - I don't have many male friends myself.\\
192 - To friendship.\\
193 - To friendship.\\
194 - I'm straight.\\
195 - Me, too.\\
196 - Malcolm, what's going on?\\
197 - Get away. I'm not talking to you.\\
198 - Why? What'd I do?\\
199 - You keep telling lies about me.\\
200 - Come on, man. It's just a joke.\\
201 - I-I didn't know you were so sensitive.\\
202 - Excuse me.\\
203 - My friend here thinks you're really pretty.\\
204 - No, I don't, I mean...\\
205 - Come on, Malcolm, just tell her.\\
206 - Okay, maybe then you'll stop following her around everywhere.\\
207 - I am telling you, it is not healthy.\\
208 - Aah! Your mom said to stay away from us!\\
209 - Damn it!\\
210 - Damn it, Hector, not over there!\\
211 - Are you deaf or stupid or both?!\\
212 - Could you please try to be a little less useless?\\
213 - Where is the sun?\\
214 - Do you see the sun?!\\
215 - I told you to dig the holes over there!\\
216 - El sol?!\\
217 - God, you people drive me nuts with your laziness!\\
218 - What is the matter with you?!\\
219 - Excuse me?\\
220 - You can't talk to him like that!\\
221 - He's a human being.\\
222 - You talk to him like\\
223 - he's some kind of animal.\\
224 - I will deal with the help the way I want to.\\
225 - He is not "the help."\\
226 - He's not a servant or a slave.\\
227 - He's a professional.\\
228 - He's a person with a skill--\\
229 - a skill you do not have, which is why you hired him!\\
230 - Oh, for God's sake,\\
231 - just pick it up!\\
232 - Who does that woman think she is?\\
233 - Suddenly fake boobs and $50 highlights\\
234 - allow you to treat other people like dirt?\\
235 - I tell you, Hal, they are officially\\
236 - the worst neighbors we've ever had.\\
237 - Worst neighbors?\\
238 - Honey, that's not really fair to Mike.\\
239 - Remember the 70-year-old swingers?\\
240 - Dad, they're horrible.\\
241 - Look at what their little piranha did to me.\\
242 - Every time I go outside, Emily's there, lying in wait.\\
243 - Yeah, and that kid Josh keeps making up\\
244 - all these weird lies about me.\\
245 - He told the whole school\\
246 - that I was born with both sex organs and raised as a girl\\
247 - until I was five.\\
248 - Their gnome wants to eat me.\\
249 - It's evil.\\
250 - They're all evil, sweetie.\\
251 - I think the word everyone is tiptoeing around is "feud."\\
252 - That's a bit drastic, Reese.\\
253 - No, Dad, a feud is just what this family needs.\\
254 - Having a common enemy will hone our skills\\
255 - and unite us\\
256 - in a brotherhood of blood.\\
257 - Look, all I'm saying is that, before we judge them,\\
258 - maybe we should take a long, hard look at ourselves.\\
259 - Oh, never mind.\\
260 - Ow!\\
261 - No! No! No!\\
262 - Do you think Colonel North is going to be impressed\\
263 - by such a sloppy group of cadets?\\
264 - Now, we are going to do this\\
265 - and keep doing it until you get it right!\\
266 - All right, now, once more.\\
267 - With feeling.\\
268 - And...\\
269 -     Candy Man    \\
270 -     Hey!    \\
271 -     Candy Man    \\
272 -     Who can take a sunrise    \\
273 -      Who can take a sunrise     \\
274 -     Sprinkle it with dew         Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh    \\
275 -     Cover it with choc'late and a miracle or two    \\
276 -     Candy Man    \\
277 -      Candy Man     \\
278 -     Oh, the Candy Man can    \\
279 -      The Candy Man can     \\
280 -     The Candy Man can    \\
281 -     'Cause he mixes it with love    \\
282 -     And makes the world taste good    \\
283 -      Oh, oh, oh     \\
284 -     The Candy Man makes    \\
285 -     Everything he bakes    \\
286 -     Satisfying and delicious    \\
287 -      Do-do-do-do-do-do...     \\
288 -     Talk about your childhood wishes    \\
289 -     You can even eat the dishes.    \\
290 - She's out there.\\
291 - Who?\\
292 - Emily-- the Demon Child.\\
293 - She's everywhere.\\
294 - No matter where I go or what I do, she's there.\\
295 - I'm going crazy.\\
296 - Aren't you the one who wanted a feud?\\
297 - Malcolm, you know I don't think things through.\\
298 - How am I supposed to fight her?\\
299 - I can't hit her.\\
300 - I can't do anything to her, and she knows it.\\
301 - I'm completely defenseless.\\
302 - Reese, she's four.\\
303 - You're bigger and smarter than...\\
304 - Well, you're bigger.\\
305 - Malcolm, would you come out here, please?\\
306 - Malcolm, these people would like a word with you.\\
307 - We've had a report that you've been seen prowling\\
308 - in the neighbors' yards and peeking in their windows.\\
309 - What?\\
310 - So you've decided\\
311 - to become a Peeping Tom?\\
312 - A Peeping Tom?!\\
313 - But I didn't do it.\\
314 - Why would I want to look in anybody's windows?\\
315 - Have you seen the people in this neighborhood?\\
316 - Peeping isn't about looks, son.\\
317 - It's about the thrill and exhilaration\\
318 - of observing someone without their knowledge.\\
319 - You still have to go to Dayton?\\
320 - Yeah, but it's only a couple of days.\\
321 - How was your presentation?\\
322 - Oh, great. Your joke killed.\\
323 - Look at us.\\
324 - We've been reduced to sneaking around at night.\\
325 - A man should be able to talk to his best friend in daylight.\\
326 - Did you say "best"?\\
327 - I should go.\\
328 - This has been going on for days.\\
329 - I can't believe everybody fell for Josh's stupid lie.\\
330 - Maybe if I just ignore it for a while, it'll go away.\\
331 - People have short memories, right?\\
332 -     Late at night, when you're sleeping    \\
333 -     That's when Malcolm    \\
334 -     Comes a-peeping    \\
335 -     You better watch out    \\
336 -     You better beware    \\
337 -     Or Malcolm will see your underwear.    \\
338 - What are you doing? Where did you learn that?\\
339 - At school.\\
340 -     One, two, three, four    \\
341 -     Malcolm's at your bedroom door    \\
342 -     Five, six, seven...    \\
343 - Oh, my God!\\
344 - What are you doing?!\\
345 - These are our hedges!\\
346 - This is the property line!\\
347 - The property line! The property line!\\
348 - You can't cross the property line!\\
349 - I can see you!\\
350 - Don't think you can hide from me!\\
351 - What don't you come out here\\
352 - and apologize to me like an adult?!\\
353 - Oh!\\
354 - Oh, that's real mature.\\
355 - Don't think you can get rid of me so easy!\\
356 - Fine.\\
357 - That's the way you want it to be?\\
358 - You'll get these back when you fix my hedges!\\
359 - What's going on?\\
360 - We're on our fifth rendition of "Candy Man."\\
361 - Where is Spangler?\\
362 - He says he's not ready.\\
363 - What's he trying to do?\\
364 - Make a fashionable entrance?\\
365 - North's been waiting for dinner for 45 minutes.\\
366 - He's going to fill up on cheese and crackers.\\
367 - Huh?\\
368 - Are you all right, sir?\\
369 - I am a little under the weather.\\
370 - You're drunk, sir.\\
371 - That could be why.\\
372 - I was a tad nervous about Colonel North's visit.\\
373 - I thought that a little nip of something might help.\\
374 - That, and seven or eight belts of Scotch.\\
375 - Let's get you dressed.\\
376 - And attached.\\
377 - The man is a national hero.\\
378 - He has done so many things\\
379 - and I have done so little.\\
380 - I don't deserve to breathe the same air as that great man.\\
381 - Don't talk like that, sir.\\
382 - No!\\
383 - I'm a worm.\\
384 - Cadet, I'm a worm.\\
385 - I belong on the floor with the other worms.\\
386 - Sir, get up.\\
387 - Sir, please stop wriggling.\\
388 - Sir?\\
389 - Look, we just sneak over the fence,\\
390 - plant the stolen goods under Josh's window,\\
391 - and make an anonymous phone call to the police\\
392 - from Stevie's house.\\
393 - Yeah, I know it's stupid, but I'm too desperate to care.\\
394 - Are you sure this is going to work?\\
395 - If there's one thing I've learned,\\
396 - it's you can't clear your own name.\\
397 - You can only ruin someone else's.\\
398 - Yeah, but... Trust me.\\
399 - I've thought of everything.\\
400 - Everyone's going to think Josh is a thief.\\
401 - His parents are going to be tied up in court\\
402 - and Emily's going to be thrown in a foster home\\
403 - where she'll bite her foster parents,\\
404 - who will then leave her at a rest stop somewhere,\\
405 - and she can spend the rest of her life\\
406 - biting hillbillies on the interstate.\\
407 - Okay.\\
408 - My God, you people are handsome.\\
409 - Dios m  o!\\
410 - Oh, oh!\\
411 - Oh, you little monsters!\\
412 - He's teaching me to swim.\\
413 - I can't believe after all he put us through,\\
414 - Spangler ends up getting drunk\\
415 - and standing up the colonel.\\
416 - Yeah, that was creepy\\
417 - the way he was wriggling around on the floor like that,\\
418 - calling for his mother.\\
419 - I'll go check on him.\\
420 - Sir?\\
421 - Who's there?\\
422 - Uh, just me, sir.\\
423 - What time is it?\\
424 - Colonel North should be here any minute.\\
425 - It's morning, sir.\\
426 - You, you already missed reveille.\\
427 - Oh, my God.\\
428 - Oh, my God.\\
429 - The one chance I had to be face-to-face with my hero,\\
430 - and I slept through his visit?\\
431 - Slept through his visit, sir?\\
432 - You guys were up all night talking.\\
433 - We did?\\
434 - Yeah, you really hit it off.\\
435 - He told you to call him Ollie.\\
436 - Really? Don't you remember?\\
437 - You two were joking and laughing like old friends.\\
438 - And drinking Scotch, lots and lots of Scotch.\\
439 - Yes, we did, didn't we?\\
440 - If I may say so, sir,\\
441 - you were the happiest I have ever seen you.\\
442 - Well, you may... you may.\\
443 - Now, if you will excuse me, I have to get myself ready.\\
444 - Dude, that was classy.\\
445 - Thanks.\\
446 - So when do we get back the pictures\\
447 - of him in the negligee?\\
448 - Wednesday.\\
449 - Poster size takes two days.\\
450 - Hey, I'm really sorry about you and Tina.\\
451 - What's this?\\
452 - A mix tape.\\
453 - Hey.\\
454 - Hi, neighbor. Steve Jenkins.\\
455 - Sorry, Steve.\\
456 - It's just too soon for me.
\subsection {Episode 14: Hal Quits}
1 - Mom, Dad, guess what. The Tooth Fairy came.\\
2 - He did?\\
3 - Oh! So what'd he give you-- a couple dollars?\\
4 - I got a rock and half a stick of gum.\\
5 - Malcolm!\\
6 - Reese!\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Watch this, Francis-- I can make milk come out of either nostril.\\
20 - He's gotten pretty good at this.\\
21 - It's sad, but I'm actually kind of jealous.\\
22 - Reese, anything coming out of your nose\\
23 - is going right back in your mouth.\\
24 - This corner of my waffle's still frozen.\\
25 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.\\
26 - I had to put Francis' waffle on top,\\
27 - and that toaster oven just isn't big enough.\\
28 - It's your fault my waffle's frozen?\\
29 - Sorry.\\
30 - Francis, you'd better get moving. You don't want\\
31 - to be late for your first day of inventory.\\
32 - Oh, yeah, Mom. Thanks again for getting me that job.\\
33 - Some of the guys\\
34 - are spending their spring break river rafting.\\
35 - You wouldn't believe how jealous they were when they heard I was\\
36 - going to be counting shampoo bottles at the Lucky Aide.\\
37 - Sorry, Francis, but it's the perfect fit:\\
38 - we needed people and you have no choice.\\
39 - Hey! Look at the sexy professor!\\
40 - Dad, you're bringing all that junk to Dewey's class?\\
41 - Yes, I am, Malcolm.\\
42 - This is my first Career Day.\\
43 - I want to make sure I dazzle 'em!\\
44 - I want Dewey to be proud of his old man.\\
45 - One out of four wouldn't be so bad.\\
46 - Dad, they're six years old.\\
47 - Which is why we have to keep things moving.\\
48 - We'll start with the pie chart,\\
49 - then move to Earnings Index.\\
50 - Do I have to do this?\\
51 - Relax, Malcolm. Your teacher said it's fine.\\
52 - You'll just make up what you miss after school.\\
53 - You know, I am really looking forward to this.\\
54 - I think this is going to be a lot of fun.\\
55 - Well, no, that's not, not all I do.\\
56 - I, uh, there are some, you know, important\\
57 - and, uh, very, uh,\\
58 - interesting...\\
59 - Could you repeat the question?\\
60 - Your job sounds awful.\\
61 - Well, of course it's awful; it's a job.\\
62 - You know...\\
63 - He's tanking.\\
64 - He's way past tanking.\\
65 - See, you, you kids have to realize that all jobs are awful\\
66 - and there's nothing that you can do about that.\\
67 - I mean, they're, they're tedious and boring.\\
68 - Being a fireman isn't boring.\\
69 - True, but you have to take into consideration\\
70 - the high mortality rate.\\
71 - It's real easy to get killed in a fire.\\
72 - My daddy's a fireman.\\
73 - Pete's daddy's going to die?\\
74 - Oh, and I'm sure he's probably going to be fine.\\
75 - So the only reason you like your job\\
76 - is because you won't get killed in a fire?\\
77 - Yes.\\
78 - Well, actually, you see...\\
79 - you see, I-I work on a very high floor,\\
80 - so that's not necessarily true.\\
81 - Any other questions?\\
82 - If your job is so boring and you don't like it\\
83 - why do you do it?\\
84 - You quit your job?\\
85 - Lois, please, give me\\
86 - a little more credit than that.\\
87 - No, I asked for a leave of absence\\
88 - because of a kidney malfunction.\\
89 - Nice.\\
90 - Drastic but vague enough to discourage\\
91 - any follow-up questions.\\
92 - Way to go.\\
93 - You're doing this because of what a seven-year-old said?\\
94 - It was horrible. He made Dad cry.\\
95 - This kid was ruthless...\\
96 - but fair.\\
97 - His  dad did a puppet show.\\
98 - I'll tell you boys, life is crazy.\\
99 - One day you're in community college\\
100 - driving a Camaro T-top,\\
101 - cock of the walk,\\
102 - and then you need some cash, so you get a job.\\
103 - You think it's only temporary, but then you get a promotion\\
104 - and then a raise,\\
105 - and all these doors open up for you,\\
106 - except they're not really doors. They're trapdoors.\\
107 - And then all of a sudden--\\
108 - bam! 20 years has zipped by, and you're thinking,\\
109 - "Is this all I have to my life?"\\
110 - Not you kids.\\
111 - I love you kids, but, come on-- the house-- it's crap.\\
112 - Boys, I want to talk to your father alone.\\
113 - So, you've got a bedroom. We're eating.\\
114 - Just kidding, we're leaving.\\
115 - Hal...\\
116 - is this a midlife crisis?\\
117 - I don't know what it is.\\
118 - I-I-- it-- I just know that I had to do something.\\
119 - And what is it exactly you plan on doing?\\
120 - What I have always talked about doing...\\
121 - a thing that has been in my head for years.\\
122 - The painting?\\
123 - Yes, I-I-I can see it so clearly.\\
124 - Every line, every streak,\\
125 - every daub.\\
126 - The blazing crimson flushes,\\
127 - the vivid blue tones.\\
128 - The almost subliminal tinges of tangerine.\\
129 - Yes, Hal, I have heard this before, but...\\
130 - Lois, I got to get this out of my head.\\
131 - Do you know how crazy this is? Yeah.\\
132 - You were going to save the painting until retirement,\\
133 - when it's okay to be insane.\\
134 - Hal, I was really looking forward\\
135 - to that old painter guy puttering around the house\\
136 - with a little old spot of paint on his cheek.\\
137 - I'm sorry, baby, I just, I just can't wait anymore.\\
138 - Maybe I can be the old gardener guy.\\
139 - Okay.\\
140 - Yes? Really? Yes?\\
141 - This is important to you,\\
142 - and up until about five minutes ago\\
143 - you were a very good husband and father.\\
144 - You deserve this.\\
145 - Oh, thank you.\\
146 - You deserve something really great.\\
147 - I really wish I could buy it for you,\\
148 - but I'm going to be digging pretty deep\\
149 - into the savings for art supplies.\\
150 - Thank you.\\
151 - Congratulations, people.\\
152 - You have all passed the rigorous Lucky Aide\\
153 - inventory screening process.\\
154 - You should be proud. This is a great crew.\\
155 - We've done a few trust games, some stretches.\\
156 - Now we're ready for battle.\\
157 - As I already explained,\\
158 - corporate has us pitted against the downtown store.\\
159 - First one to finish inventory gets a plaque and a hundred...\\
160 - a plaque.\\
161 - Yes, a question.\\
162 - Yes, which household product will kill me fastest?\\
163 - We're going to start you off counting the cotton swabs.\\
164 - Bleach... or oven cleaner\\
165 - or Rat Grenade. Rat Grenade's good.\\
166 - It's weird.\\
167 - All my life, Dad's been getting up every morning\\
168 - and dragging himself to a job that he despised\\
169 - with every fiber of his being.\\
170 - I can't believe I never noticed.\\
171 - I guess I've been pretty self-centered.\\
172 - Oh, my God!\\
173 - What if that happens to me?\\
174 - Two quarts of amber varnish.\\
175 - A number two camel hair brush.\\
176 - Or maybe a Kalinsky sable.\\
177 - Camel hair brush, Kalinsky sable.\\
178 - How do you know about all this stuff?\\
179 - You never painted anything in your life.\\
180 - I have been painting this for 15 years, Lois...\\
181 - up here.\\
182 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
183 - Do you people have any idea\\
184 - what this kind of mindless labor does to a person?\\
185 - It kills your soul.\\
186 - It turns your mind into jelly\\
187 - and it crushes your spirit to dust.\\
188 - Oh, Craig called. He wants you there tomorrow at 7:00 instead of 8:00.\\
189 - Oh, and can you keep it down when you get up in the morning?\\
190 - I'm sleeping in.\\
191 - So, Malcolm, word on the street is\\
192 - your father wigged out at work.\\
193 - What?\\
194 - Did he really set his desk on fire and dance around it?\\
195 - I heard it was a lovers' quarrel\\
196 - with the cleaning lady.\\
197 - That's crazy.\\
198 - Where are you guys hearing all this stuff?\\
199 - My dad's fine.\\
200 - He's just taking some time off from work\\
201 - because he hates his job.\\
202 - You know, it's actually kind of got me thinking.\\
203 - What am I going to do when I grow up?\\
204 - You mean you don't have a plan in place?\\
205 - No.\\
206 - That's okay, Malcolm.\\
207 - I mean, it's not too...\\
208 - Excuse me, allergies.\\
209 - You guys already have your careers planned?\\
210 - You don't just  luck  into\\
211 - running a particle accelerator, you know.\\
212 - With my intelligence...\\
213 - and tokenism...\\
214 - the sky's...\\
215 - the limit.\\
216 - Okay.\\
217 - How many is that?\\
218 - Oobin keitch.\\
219 - Write it down.\\
220 - That's a number?\\
221 - Where are you from?\\
222 - Red alert! Everyone gather 'round.\\
223 - People, my sources tell me that downtown found\\
224 - some Rain Man-type human calculator\\
225 - at a homeless shelter.\\
226 - Now, I hear he's prone to tantrums,\\
227 - but we can't count on that.\\
228 - So I'm going to need everyone to work late tonight.\\
229 - Oh, Francis?\\
230 - The loose candy bin count looks a bit hinky to me.\\
231 - I want you to double-check the malt balls.\\
232 - Should I start with the 40 in your belly?\\
233 - I heard that\\
234 - and I'm paying for those.\\
235 - Things are starting to get really strange around here.\\
236 - It's Dad, he's so... happy.\\
237 - Mmm, this meat loaf is incredible.\\
238 - New recipe?\\
239 - Same as it's always been.\\
240 - Oh, come on, something's different.\\
241 - I can tell.\\
242 - Oh, actually, you know what?\\
243 - I was out of tomato paste, and I used\\
244 - ketchup instead. Uh-huh, see? I could taste it.\\
245 - It's good, isn't it, kiddo?\\
246 - What's the matter, son?\\
247 - A girl at school called me "Ewey Dewey."\\
248 - This is the same girl who puts\\
249 - paste in your hair all the time, isn't it?\\
250 - Mm-hmm, well, you know, she's just doing this because\\
251 - she likes you. It's her way of getting your attention.\\
252 - So she doesn't think I'm ewey?\\
253 - No, of course not.\\
254 - He's right. Hmm.\\
255 - Hey, Dad? Hmm.\\
256 - I have a little situation that maybe you can help me out with.\\
257 - There's this girl who's... I suggest\\
258 - that you leave her alone\\
259 - before she calls the police on you.\\
260 - Okay, thanks.\\
261 - What's wrong?\\
262 - What do you mean?\\
263 - Well, I noticed you looking at me.\\
264 - Nothing.\\
265 - See? It's creepy.\\
266 - You know, Hal, I got to admit it.\\
267 - Not working has really been good for you.\\
268 - You seem so much happier,\\
269 - so much more attentive, tuned in to the boys.\\
270 - Hal...\\
271 - My God, you're beautiful.\\
272 - Okay, team, you did a great job yesterday.\\
273 - Unfortunately, I lost all the numbers.\\
274 - I think I accidentally mailed them to my mom.\\
275 - Yeah, so... whoops.\\
276 - So why don't you guys start recounting?\\
277 - I'm going to head to the downtown store\\
278 - and play a little "defense," if you know what I'm saying.\\
279 - Uh... Garkech, you're in charge.\\
280 - Whoa, whoa, whoa... you're putting him in charge?\\
281 - He doesn't speak English.\\
282 - We don't even know if Garkech is really his name.\\
283 - We don't know that it's not.\\
284 - Besides, he hasn't questioned every decision I've made.\\
285 - That's because he can't.\\
286 - And what happened to our lunch break?\\
287 - I can't hear you.\\
288 - Thought you might be ready for some aspirin.\\
289 - I'm working for a moron.\\
290 - Of course you are, honey.\\
291 - Your boss is an idiot,\\
292 - your coworkers are incompetent,\\
293 - and you are underappreciated.\\
294 - Welcome to the working world.\\
295 - How do people do it?\\
296 - Well, let's see...\\
297 - If you want to eat, sleep indoors,\\
298 - you know, those kinds of luxuries,\\
299 - you really don't have much of a choice.\\
300 - What about Dad? He had a choice.\\
301 - Every 20 years, you're allowed a two-week breakdown.\\
302 - Oh, I can't wait.\\
303 - He says, "Get back to work!"\\
304 - I really appreciate\\
305 - your letting me take this vocational exam.\\
306 - I know it's generally for older kids.\\
307 - I just felt like I really needed some help.\\
308 - I don't want to make a wrong decision.\\
309 - Well... did you get the test results?\\
310 - Oh, yes.\\
311 - What did they say I should do?\\
312 - Well... according to this...\\
313 - absolutely anything you want.\\
314 - What?\\
315 - Yeah, you-you scored\\
316 - equally excellent in all areas.\\
317 - According to this test,\\
318 - there isn't a career on the planet\\
319 - you wouldn't be great at.\\
320 - Congratulations.\\
321 - Well, that... that doesn't exactly clarify anything.\\
322 - I-I was kind of hoping...\\
323 - You know, kid, there are a lot of people\\
324 - who would kill to have both "professional golfer"\\
325 - and "neurosurgeon" on their test results.\\
326 - Yeah, but that doesn't help me.\\
327 - I mean, how am I supposed to decide\\
328 - if I don't have any parameters at all?\\
329 - Well, boo-hoo for you, Mr. Unlimited Potential.\\
330 - Let me wipe my tears for you on my plastic briefcase.\\
331 - Does the test at least say what I might like?\\
332 - Aside from exposing middle-aged underachievers\\
333 - for the failures they are?\\
334 - Nope.\\
335 - Can I take the test again?\\
336 - Uh... no.\\
337 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
338 - I have to catch a bus\\
339 - or I'll be late for my night job...\\
340 - unless, of course, you'd like that, too.\\
341 -        \\
342 -        \\
343 - Dad, what are you doing up? It's, like, 5:30 in the morning.\\
344 - Ooh, wow. Really? 5:30?\\
345 - Yeah, I should be getting to bed. What are you doing up?\\
346 - I'm going to work. Maybe you remember it.\\
347 - Oh, hey, Francis, can I borrow 20 bucks?\\
348 - I need to buy some more paint.\\
349 - What? You just bought, like, six cans of paint yesterday.\\
350 - What happened to that?\\
351 - I used it. Man, what are you grilling me for?\\
352 - How can you use six cans of paint in one day?\\
353 - Francis, please, I really need it.\\
354 - I'm so close.\\
355 - It's almost right.\\
356 - Do you have any idea how hard I have to work to make $20?\\
357 - All right. All right!\\
358 - I didn't ask for a lecture.\\
359 - Hey, Dad, can we ask you for some advice?\\
360 - The girl who's been bugging Dewey\\
361 - still won't leave him alone.\\
362 - Now she's calling me Dewey Dwarf.\\
363 - I told him-- you've got to fight fire with fire\\
364 - and he should come up with some really raunchy nickname for her\\
365 - and spread it around school and church and stuff.\\
366 - You know, really get it out there.\\
367 - Uh, yeah, good for you, boys.\\
368 - So the name thing?\\
369 - You're on board with that?\\
370 - All right, let's get to work.\\
371 - What's that girl's name again?\\
372 - Regina Tucker.\\
373 - Don't worry. We'll think of something.\\
374 - Another day of crap.\\
375 - Damn catalogs.\\
376 - Idiot foreman.\\
377 - Watch your step.\\
378 - Whatever.\\
379 - So tired.\\
380 - Hal, it's past midnight.\\
381 - Are you coming to bed?\\
382 - No! How can I go to bed?\\
383 - It's nothing what it should be.\\
384 - Honey, this is your dream.\\
385 - It's supposed to be fun.\\
386 - What are you talking about, fun?\\
387 - This isn't fun.\\
388 - This is driving me crazy!\\
389 - I just... I-I-I can't get it right.\\
390 - Well, you don't have to finish it.\\
391 - Look at you! You're killing yourself.\\
392 - One more day. That's all.\\
393 - I just need one more day!\\
394 - Hal, there has got to be, like, 500 gallons of paint up there.\\
395 - There isn't...\\
396 - Yeah, that's about right.\\
397 - Well... it's over.\\
398 - I just got the word.\\
399 - Downtown finished their inventory.\\
400 - We've lost.\\
401 - Chelooz marak!\\
402 - I think Garkech speaks for all of us.\\
403 - I'll be in the cookie aisle.\\
404 - Well, I say we just make up\\
405 - the rest of the numbers and go home.\\
406 - Wait a minute, go home?\\
407 - Weren't you listening? We lost.\\
408 - I just spent my entire spring break\\
409 - counting flip-flops and Vagisil.\\
410 - You're saying that was all for nothing?\\
411 - Yes.\\
412 - Do you know how many parties I missed this week?\\
413 - How many spring break debaucheries I could've been at?\\
414 - How many drunken sorority girls ripped their tops off\\
415 - without me there to yell encouragement?\\
416 - You can't tell me that was for nothing!\\
417 - We can't quit!\\
418 - Come on, guys. We took on a challenge.\\
419 - I'm staying until this is done the right way.\\
420 - Who's with me?\\
421 - Why aren't you translating?\\
422 - There's no point, but please go on.\\
423 - That's it.\\
424 - Ah.\\
425 - Okay, see you.\\
426 - All right, now, keep them closed.\\
427 - Come on.\\
428 - You've all been very patient.\\
429 - I appreciate that.\\
430 - You've been waiting a long time, so...\\
431 - Here it is.\\
432 - It's...\\
433 - Yeah.\\
434 - You're finished?\\
435 - Yeah. It's perfect!\\
436 - I mean, it's exactly how I imagined it.\\
437 - Then... look at it.\\
438 - What?\\
439 - Look at your painting.\\
440 - Oh, I can see it.\\
441 - Hal, I want you to look at that painting\\
442 - and tell me that you're satisfied with it.\\
443 - I knew it! You are not finished.\\
444 - I can't do it, Lois.\\
445 - It is driving me crazy.\\
446 - I have been slapping on paint\\
447 - day after day and I've got nothing!\\
448 - And I'm never going to get it right\\
449 - so I might as well just forget it.\\
450 - Oh, you listen to me, Hal.\\
451 - You are not going back to work\\
452 - until you get this out of your system.\\
453 - No!\\
454 - You don't understand.\\
455 - It is no use!\\
456 - You are not giving up.\\
457 - You are going to stay right here until you are finished.\\
458 - Oh-ho-ho-ho!\\
459 - I'm not going to go through this every five years\\
460 - when you decide that there's a sculpture\\
461 - or a fountain or God knows what\\
462 - it is you still have to build.\\
463 - You are going to finish it!\\
464 - Fine! You want them\\
465 - to see me finish it, I'll finish it.\\
466 - I'll put a little bit here, huh?\\
467 - How about there? How about there?!\\
468 - And...\\
469 - Oh... oh...\\
470 - And...\\
471 - here...\\
472 - And...\\
473 - Awesome!\\
474 - I don't believe it.\\
475 - That's it. That's what was in my head.\\
476 - I've had it!\\
477 - Everyone at that place are a bunch of slacker, lazy...\\
478 - Oh, wow...\\
479 - Wow!\\
480 - Hal, I am so proud of you.\\
481 - I did it.\\
482 - I really did it.\\
483 - What's that sound?\\
484 - I don't know.\\
485 - It sounds like...\\
486 - Look out! Paint-alanche!\\
487 - Hal!\\
488 - Mime mokay! Mime mokay!\\
489 - Oh, honey, I got to go. Bye.\\
490 - Francis, come on, I'll drive you to the bus station.\\
491 - Hey, vacation's over, mister.\\
492 - Time to get back to the old grindstone. Let's go.\\
493 - You know, all this made me realize,\\
494 - why plan for my future when it's just going to end up\\
495 - with a giant wall of paint crashing down on me?\\
496 - I'm just going to enjoy being a kid for a while.\\
497 - There's a lot of good things about being a kid.\\
498 - Ow!\\
499 - That's for stepping on my side of the room.\\
500 - No pressures, no responsibilities.\\
501 - Malcolm, how many times\\
502 - do I have to tell you to make up your bed?\\
503 - You are going to make up all of our beds for a month\\
504 - starting now.\\
505 - I think I'm smart enough to know when I got it good.
\subsection {Episode 15: The Grandparents}
1 - Great pancakes, Dad.\\
2 - Oh, thanks.\\
3 - Hey, who's ready for seconds?\\
4 - I am.\\
5 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
6 -     I don't know    \\
7 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     Life is unfair.    \\
17 - So, which one of these pinks\\
18 - do you want to let float this month--\\
19 - cable or Visa?\\
20 - Oh, we can probably go without cable.\\
21 - You know, it might be fun.\\
22 - We'll get together as a family,\\
23 - play board games, sing songs.\\
24 - Okay, you made your point.\\
25 - We'll pay the cable.\\
26 - Oh... for crying out loud.\\
27 - The freezer's out again.\\
28 - What?!\\
29 - We just had that fixed.\\
30 - I know, the stupid piece of junk.\\
31 - Oh...\\
32 - It's only five years old.\\
33 - How could it keep breaking down?\\
34 - Aw, man!\\
35 - I'll go get the ice chest from the garage,\\
36 - providing that still works.\\
37 - Nuh-uh!\\
38 - Uh-huh!\\
39 - We'll let Mom settle this.\\
40 - The loser licks the tub drain. Deal.\\
41 - Mom, whose tongue's longer?\\
42 - Are you going to make us stand out here all day?!\\
43 - Mom! Dad!\\
44 - Oh, my God, honey!\\
45 - Your parents are here!\\
46 - Oh, God.\\
47 - Dewey, your grandparents are here.\\
48 - Hey, come on in.\\
49 - So, this is certainly unexpected.\\
50 - What brings you all the way down from Canada?\\
51 - Wait a minute, this can't be Reese.\\
52 - Yep.\\
53 - Uh, what's the matter with you?\\
54 - Don't you clean behind your ears?\\
55 - Look what I found!\\
56 - Ha-ha, five bucks!\\
57 - Thanks, Grandpa.\\
58 - So, Grandpa, did you have a nice drive down?\\
59 - Huh? I said, did you have a nice drive down?\\
60 - I can't hear this one. He sounds like girl.\\
61 - So, you just decided to hop in the car\\
62 - and drive on down from Canada\\
63 - without calling ahead, huh?\\
64 - How fun!\\
65 - Yeah, how long do you think you'll be staying?\\
66 - If we're such big inconvenience, we go right now.\\
67 - No. No, no, no, no, no.\\
68 - Please... Don't be silly.\\
69 - Uh, Dewey, you remember your grandparents,\\
70 - don't you, sweetie?\\
71 - He needs changing.\\
72 - He always needs changing.\\
73 - You take him.\\
74 - Ooh, let him sit in it.\\
75 - That will teach him.\\
76 - I don't want to take him; he smells.\\
77 - Ooh, that's what happens to little boys who squirm.\\
78 - Mmm...\\
79 - It's estimated that as many as 30,000 young people\\
80 - have descended on New Orleans\\
81 - to join in the annual Mardi Gras festivities.\\
82 - At this hour police have been called in to try and...\\
83 - Look at those animals going berserk,\\
84 - tearing each other's clothes off.\\
85 - Those are people\\
86 - with no respect for authority.\\
87 - Eric's right, that could be us.\\
88 - If we left right now\\
89 - we could be in New Orleans in five hours.\\
90 - How we going to get there?\\
91 - And where are we going to stay?\\
92 - Gentlemen, you quibble with me\\
93 - about logistics when I'm offering you 48 hours\\
94 - of non-stop debauchery?\\
95 - This could be the greatest weekend of our lives.\\
96 - Damn, Francis,\\
97 - you should have known better\\
98 - than to eat sushi at a truck stop.\\
99 - Hey, the cashier said the yellowtail was fresh.\\
100 - Besides, my octopus was excellent.\\
101 - Can we not talk about the fish, please?\\
102 - Guys, it's like a war zone out there.\\
103 - There's looting, rioting, and now\\
104 - the cops are turning a fire hose on the crowd.\\
105 - Wet T-shirts!\\
106 - Sorry about the takeout.\\
107 - I don't know what the deal is with the fridge.\\
108 - What do you expect?\\
109 - That brand is  dishufka.\\
110 - That's it.\\
111 - Fatten up on pizza.\\
112 - Good luck running\\
113 - when they come with the dogs and chase you into the hills.\\
114 - You know, I think it's great\\
115 - you're able to just hit the road\\
116 - without a care in the world.\\
117 - Oh... right... yeah, with me\\
118 - I'm always thinking about things back home.\\
119 - You know, did I leave the stove on?\\
120 - Is the iron plugged in?\\
121 - I once heard of a fire being caused by a mouse\\
122 - chewing through an...\\
123 - Where is my coffee?\\
124 - Uh, it's right here, Dad, just the way you like it.\\
125 - Mom, I really wish\\
126 - you'd put out that cigarette.\\
127 - It's not good for the kids.\\
128 - What, you think it'll stunt their growth?\\
129 - You turned out big enough.\\
130 - Look at him eat, like animal!\\
131 - Not like Mr. Pizza\\
132 - with knife and fork.\\
133 - You know, Dad,\\
134 - since the last time you were here,\\
135 - uh, Malcolm has been put into a special class.\\
136 - I'm not surprised.\\
137 - No, no, no, no, no, it's, uh,\\
138 - it's an advanced class.\\
139 - It's very challenging work.\\
140 - Tell him, Malcolm.\\
141 - Well, today we finished reading Grapes of Wrath\\
142 - and we're studying advanced algebra.\\
143 - What is that, shot at me?\\
144 - I no study algebra?\\
145 - It's because I go to war when I was your age.\\
146 - What good is math in war, huh?\\
147 - When you can provide for your family,\\
148 - you can have last piece of pizza.\\
149 - Dad, Hal provides for us just fine.\\
150 - Which isn't easy when someone's hogging all the pizza.\\
151 - You can't even keep food in the house\\
152 - for my grandchild.\\
153 - Do you call that providing?\\
154 - We will get the refrigerator fixed.\\
155 - For what, so it can break again?\\
156 - What does a new one cost?\\
157 - $700, $800?\\
158 - I give you $800 to buy a new one!\\
159 - Thank God our generation knew to save our money, to hold onto.\\
160 - We didn't fritter it away on things like toys and dolls.\\
161 - I dressed up piece of wood\\
162 - and I was happy to have it.\\
163 - We will not take your money.\\
164 - Of course you will!\\
165 - We love you too much to stand by\\
166 - and watch your children grow up ashamed of you.\\
167 - This is what family is for.\\
168 - Hello.\\
169 - Malcolm, listen,\\
170 - I need to know what Mom used to put in the hot tea\\
171 - when we were sick.\\
172 - Is she around?\\
173 - I think she's changing the sheets on their bed.\\
174 - Grandma and Grandpa are here.\\
175 - Oh, you're kidding.\\
176 - So, did they knock, or did you just hear\\
177 - their cloven hooves clatter up the driveway?\\
178 - I can't be sure, but I think Grandpa spit at me.\\
179 - Look, don't take it personally.\\
180 - They're primeval creatures with tiny little hearts.\\
181 - Yeah, but there must be some reason...\\
182 - Malcolm, they have stupid lizard brains.\\
183 - They're threatened by anyone\\
184 - with an ounce of ambition or intelligence.\\
185 - They'd eat you if they had better teeth.\\
186 - This one, always on phone.\\
187 - That's Grandpa, isn't it?\\
188 - Tell him I said he's a malevolent, poisonous troll.\\
189 - Francis says, "Hi."\\
190 - No-good delinquent.\\
191 - He says "Hi" back.\\
192 - No, absolutely not.\\
193 - I will not let you take their money.\\
194 - Why not?\\
195 - Because they'll never let you forget\\
196 - that they had to give you $800.\\
197 - They'll use it to try to humiliate you.\\
198 - They do that now.\\
199 - Lois, come on, I know what your folks think of me.\\
200 - We  need  the fridge.\\
201 - We can't store the meat on the porch forever.\\
202 - I'm big enough to take one for the team.\\
203 - What?\\
204 - You're better than all of us.\\
205 - Oh...\\
206 - Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo!\\
207 - We can't do this on Dewey's bed.\\
208 - Reese's looks okay.\\
209 - Thank you.\\
210 - Hmm.\\
211 - Do you know this thing makes ice cubes\\
212 - in both circular and crescent shapes?\\
213 - How do they expect people to decide?\\
214 - Well, it's nice to have\\
215 - something in the house that works.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - You know, maybe in their dark, twisted world,\\
218 - this is how your parents show love.\\
219 - Hey, Victor, pretty great, huh?\\
220 - My descending colon's inflamed.\\
221 - What's great?\\
222 - Uh, listen, Dad,\\
223 - I just mailed off\\
224 - the mortgage and car payments,\\
225 - and what with buying the new refrigerator and all,\\
226 - we should probably get that check from you right away.\\
227 - About that... your mother and I decided it's no good\\
228 - for family to give money to family.\\
229 - Always ends badly.\\
230 - Pulp!\\
231 - Who buys orange juice with pulp?\\
232 - How can they do this?!\\
233 - How can they just offer us money\\
234 - and then pretend it never happened?\\
235 - I am going to kill them.\\
236 - I swear I'm going to snap their necks like chickens!\\
237 - That is not going to pay off the debt, Lois.\\
238 - Unless you're a beneficiary\\
239 - on some sort of life insurance policy.\\
240 - What am I saying?\\
241 - Look, look, why don't we just\\
242 - return the refrigerator?\\
243 - I can't. I bought it on sale.\\
244 - Oh, Hal, what are we going to do?\\
245 - Well, what choice do we have?\\
246 - For the next couple of weeks,\\
247 - until we get caught back up,\\
248 - we're just going to have to work a ton of overtime.\\
249 - Oh, really?\\
250 - And who's going to look after the kids?\\
251 - So, we thought the perfect thing might be\\
252 - if you could stay a little longer\\
253 - and keep an eye on the kids.\\
254 - I don't know.\\
255 - Mother and I should go.\\
256 - We sense tension.\\
257 - No!\\
258 - Oh, no!\\
259 - Oh, no, no, no, there's no, there's no tension.\\
260 - We just, uh, we have a couple of hectic weeks coming up\\
261 - and we just hoped that you could stay a little longer.\\
262 - Of course.\\
263 - We do anything for you.\\
264 - We are a family.\\
265 - Oh, Dewey, hey, guess what.\\
266 - Grandma and Grandpa\\
267 - are going to stay and watch you guys\\
268 - for the next couple of weeks.\\
269 - How you doing, Francis?\\
270 - I need a doctor.\\
271 - We got you something better, man.\\
272 - We brought you beads!\\
273 - You wouldn't believe it out there, Francis.\\
274 - There's free beer\\
275 - and the women take their tops off\\
276 - when you give them beads.\\
277 - Is it possible we crashed our car on the way down here\\
278 - and died and went to heaven?\\
279 - I'd welcome death right now.\\
280 - I can't believe this is you talking, Francis.\\
281 - You're our leader.\\
282 - If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't even be here.\\
283 - You know what?\\
284 - You're right.\\
285 - This is Mardi Gras.\\
286 - I can do this.\\
287 - Yeah. All right.\\
288 - Give me those beads.\\
289 - Yeah! Come on!\\
290 - Francis! Francis!\\
291 - Francis! Francis! Francis!\\
292 - Thank God we found a hotel with a drain in the hallway.\\
293 - We're back.\\
294 - Still no parents?\\
295 - If you're going to work all the time,\\
296 - don't have children.\\
297 - Hey, I wanted ice cream. I don't blame you.\\
298 - Why do they always do that?\\
299 - They take you for ice cream and stuff and never ask me.\\
300 - I've thought about that.\\
301 - And I think they see me as the protector of the bloodline.\\
302 - If the future's half as bad as Grandpa and I suspect,\\
303 - the only survivors are going to be mutants,\\
304 - cockroaches and me...\\
305 - all living underwater.\\
306 - Let's face it: they're backing a winner.\\
307 - Oh, man, I'm stuffed.\\
308 - I shouldn't have had a second one.\\
309 - Are you okay, Grandma?\\
310 - 'Cause I could carry your purse for you.\\
311 - Or maybe your whiskey.\\
312 - I once strangled a border guard with my bare hands.\\
313 - Just asking.\\
314 - So, I studied about your country in school.\\
315 - Always with the books.\\
316 - You won't be happy till you get eye cancer.\\
317 - No, really.\\
318 - I found the folklore very interesting.\\
319 - And the history, the wars, the revolution.\\
320 - It must've been very hard for you growing up.\\
321 - It was.\\
322 - Very hard.\\
323 - Have a snort.\\
324 - Maybe later.\\
325 - Hey, look at the mama's boy.\\
326 - You going to take that? What?\\
327 - Hey, you boys!\\
328 - Come back here and say that.\\
329 - Grandma, what are you doing?\\
330 - Who's this? Your 90-year-old bodyguard?\\
331 - No, no, it's okay.\\
332 - She's kidding.\\
333 - Nushkaya zibhat shinka!\\
334 - Ow!\\
335 - Grandma.\\
336 - Oh, geez.\\
337 - I don't know why you won't tell me who did this.\\
338 - You know, there's no honor in protecting a bully.\\
339 - Okay, it's your face.\\
340 - Mom, do you...?\\
341 - Do you like your parents?\\
342 - It doesn't matter how I feel about them.\\
343 - It's not like I can trade them in for someone else.\\
344 - You can't pick your parents.\\
345 - You're pretty much stuck with who you get.\\
346 - I know.\\
347 - Anyway, they're certainly not going to change.\\
348 - If things get too difficult,\\
349 - at least I can be grateful that soon they'll be gone.\\
350 - Back to their own home?\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - That's what I meant.\\
353 - Never thought I'd beat you home.\\
354 - They had us keep both registers open till midnight.\\
355 - What kind of idiot needs a beach ball\\
356 - at 11:00 at night?\\
357 - Did you make the kids' lunches?\\
358 - Oh, right. No, not yet.\\
359 - I've been kind of tied up here.\\
360 - You know, I discovered something kind of interesting, yeah.\\
361 - Now, it appears the circular cubes cool quicker,\\
362 - but the crescent ones last longer.\\
363 - Oh, for God's sake, Hal, will you quit playing around?\\
364 - That is a rectal thermometer.\\
365 - I'm going to go brush my teeth.\\
366 - You know, I ask you to do one simple thing.\\
367 - I can't do it all myself, you know?\\
368 - Hey.\\
369 - Are you upset about something?\\
370 - Look, I'm tired. I just got off a double shift.\\
371 - I want to go to bed.\\
372 - Sure.\\
373 - You just seemed a little snappish about the cubes.\\
374 - Because I'm tired of you not helping out around here.\\
375 - All right, Lois.\\
376 - I know we're both a little raw from the last five days,\\
377 - but that's no reason\\
378 - to dump your frustration with your parents onto me.\\
379 - On you? Oh, yes.\\
380 - Because that's what this is all about.\\
381 - You're angry at them\\
382 - and you're displacing your anger onto me.\\
383 - I mean, it is classic.\\
384 - Oh, I'm displacing, am I?\\
385 - Kind of like how you're focusing all your attention\\
386 - on that monstrosity in the kitchen?\\
387 - See, I knew it!\\
388 - You don't like the refrigerator.\\
389 - I hate that refrigerator.\\
390 - I hate its tubular handles.\\
391 - I hate the way it keeps the butter.\\
392 - I hate that, when I'm trying to sleep,\\
393 - I can hear it whirring.\\
394 - Oh, no, you can't.\\
395 - Yes, yes, I can.\\
396 - No. Not the 5100.\\
397 - That motor housing is four layers thick, Lois.\\
398 - Four layers.\\
399 - And it keeps things too cold.\\
400 - That is unfounded criticism, Lois.\\
401 - Unfounded and unfair.\\
402 - And until you apologize, I will be in the garage.\\
403 - I told you there was tension.\\
404 - Hey, Grandma.\\
405 - Grandpa wanted to know if you could...\\
406 - Ow!\\
407 - What was that for?\\
408 - See, you not even try to defend yourself.\\
409 - Why are you so weak?\\
410 - I wasn't expecting for you to hit me.\\
411 - That's what they're counting on\\
412 - when they kick down your door in the middle of the night. Ow!\\
413 - Grandma, stop this.\\
414 - Come on, show me what you got. Come on, come on.\\
415 - Grandma, I'm not going to hit you.\\
416 - A kid should never have to say that.\\
417 - So how you going to fight these people\\
418 - when they throw you in the truck and take you away?\\
419 - You going to read to them?\\
420 - You going to impress them to death\\
421 - with your giant know-it-all brain?\\
422 - Huh?\\
423 - Look, I'm smart, okay? That's who I am.\\
424 - And if you don't like the fact\\
425 - that I'm taking high school math classes\\
426 - and reading great books,\\
427 - well, too bad.\\
428 - Because I'm going to be successful and maybe even rich\\
429 - because I am smart, okay?\\
430 - So just leave me alone.\\
431 - And I'm going to be just fine!\\
432 - Ow.\\
433 - Ha!\\
434 - I warned you about the eyes.\\
435 - What's this about?\\
436 - I want to show you something.\\
437 - Something just for you.\\
438 - I have waited many years for this moment,\\
439 - but now that you are old enough,\\
440 - I want to give you something\\
441 - close to my heart.\\
442 - Wow, is this stuff real?\\
443 - From the big war.\\
444 - Wow, is this a real gas mask?\\
445 - Gas mask, yes.\\
446 - Field glasses...\\
447 - chocolate K-rations.\\
448 - You get yourself nice girl with this, I tell you.\\
449 - This is so awesome, Grandpa.\\
450 - You're the best.\\
451 - This is so cool.\\
452 - God in heaven!\\
453 - What?!\\
454 - This is live grenade!\\
455 - Do not let go of handle or we both die.\\
456 - I don't want to die!\\
457 - Don't worry, you won't.\\
458 - All we have to do is find, find the pin.\\
459 - Find the pin, put the pin back in,\\
460 - and then everything will fine.\\
461 - Quit crying like baby.\\
462 - What's going on?\\
463 - Grandpa gave me a live grenade.\\
464 - It's really cool. You want to hold it?\\
465 - No, no, no. It's for you, not him.\\
466 - Oh, my God, we have to call the police.\\
467 - No, no police.\\
468 - No police, please.\\
469 - There's no reason to panic.\\
470 - Yes, there is.\\
471 - You gave Reese a live grenade, and he's a total idiot.\\
472 - He's right, I am.\\
473 - I don't think I should have it anymore. Here.\\
474 - No, you hold on to that.\\
475 - No, I'm tired of this game.\\
476 - I think what I really want to do is go lie down now.\\
477 - No!\\
478 - Hello.\\
479 - What was that?\\
480 - What was what?\\
481 - What happened here?!\\
482 - We can't be sure.\\
483 - Grandpa gave me a live grenade\\
484 - and it was going to blow\\
485 - and I didn't mean to drop it.\\
486 - But Malcolm threw it in the fridge.\\
487 - You gave my son a live grenade?\\
488 - You brought live ammunition into this house?\\
489 - What is the matter with you people?!\\
490 - Are you completely insane?!\\
491 - You don't ever talk to us like that, do you hear me?\\
492 - Vuschka robotisch ber doya kraup.\\
493 - Mom, I-I...\\
494 - I just... I-I just mean that...\\
495 - All right, all right.\\
496 - Lois, take the boys in the other room.\\
497 - But, Hal... Now.\\
498 - Come on.\\
499 - Why don't we sit down?\\
500 - First off, I'm not here to try to sort out\\
501 - the complicated relationship you have with the woman I love.\\
502 - That's not my place.\\
503 - And I know it would be folly to try to put a price\\
504 - on the deep psychological trauma\\
505 - that you've caused Lois through the years.\\
506 - But let me take a stab at it anyway.\\
507 - $3,000 sound okay to you? What?\\
508 - Well, that would pretty much cover the fridge,\\
509 - the collateral damage, pay off a few credit cards,\\
510 - and finally get the transmission fixed on my car.\\
511 - Because of what just happened,\\
512 - you want us to loan you $3,000?\\
513 - Please, I know you're uncomfortable lending to family,\\
514 - so let's be clear.\\
515 - With one phone call, I could have your asses thrown in jail\\
516 - for child endangerment.\\
517 - So... this money I'm asking for, it's not a loan.\\
518 - It's blackmail.\\
519 - It's like your brother Vasclev all over again.\\
520 - Come on, Francis. We got to hit the road\\
521 - or we're not going to make bed check.\\
522 - I don't care.\\
523 - I came all the way to New Orleans,\\
524 - I got all these beads...\\
525 - I'm not leaving until I get some action.\\
526 - Now, if you don't mind, I need the room.\\
527 - Okay, I'm good.

20 - You're all set, Mrs. Gunderberg.\\
21 - Remember, this is the one you take orally.\\
22 - I can do what I want, because I'm older!\\
23 - - Stop pushing me! Ow! - Shut up, Dewey!\\
24 - - Stop touching me! - I was not!\\
25 - Yes, you were! Stop it!\\
26 - Hey, guys. My shift is over in five minutes.\\
27 - Then we head over to the barber college.\\
28 - Why can't we go to a real barber?\\
29 - Because I like to support education.\\
30 - Besides, it's free.\\
31 - Are they going to take my hair and plant an evil Dewey?\\
32 - Honey, we've already had this talk.\\
33 - Every word that comes out of Reese's mouth\\
34 - is a lie, remember?\\
35 - Ah! Okay, go look at some magazines.\\
36 - And anything you break comes out of your allowance.\\
37 - We don't get an allowance.\\
38 - Yeah, now you know why.\\
39 - I'm going to ask the barber\\
40 - to shave this side totally off\\
41 - and leave the other side long.\\
42 - You know, a style for each profile.\\
43 - A different look for both my moods.\\
44 - How's it going? Not bad.\\
45 - In five minutes I get my soul back for the night. And you?\\
46 - Can't complain.\\
47 - That's $6.24.\\
48 - I-I'm... I'm sorry. What?\\
49 - Your total is $6.24.\\
50 - Uh, is there a problem?\\
51 - No, it's just that, uh...\\
52 - your assistant manager and I\\
53 - we have an arrangement.\\
54 - I wouldn't know anything about that.\\
55 - I've only got $3.00.\\
56 - Well, you can put back the magazine.\\
57 - Lois, Lois... I give Officer Stockton a discount.\\
58 - You know, policeman's discount?\\
59 - 100% off?\\
60 - Craig, I can't do that.\\
61 - But, Lois...\\
62 - Don't worry about it. It's okay, Greg.\\
63 - It's "Craig."\\
64 - What are you, crazy?\\
65 - Don't you know how this works?\\
66 - We scratch his back, he scratches ours?\\
67 - We give him a few candy bars,\\
68 - he looks out for us.\\
69 - It's called protection.\\
70 - Craig, we have been robbed five times\\
71 - in the last six months.\\
72 - Lois, think of all the places he gets free stuff from.\\
73 - He can't be everywhere at once.\\
74 - Mom, seriously, I'm not letting that kid\\
75 - with two fingers cut my hair again.\\
76 - That's all you need to use scissors.\\
77 - And you be polite.\\
78 - Those people are nervous enough as it is.\\
79 - Oh, what?\\
80 - I didn't do anything!\\
81 - Make a run for it, Mom.\\
82 - We can be on the news.\\
83 - All right, you boys, not a word out of any of you.\\
84 - No one makes piggy sounds, no one says they smell bacon,\\
85 - and no one claims to be kidnapped.\\
86 - You?\\
87 - License and registration, please.\\
88 - What's this all about?\\
89 - You impeded traffic.\\
90 - When you pulled out, that Volkswagen\\
91 - had to slam on its brakes.\\
92 - What Volkswagen?\\
93 - I looked over to my left when I pulled out.\\
94 - There was no car.\\
95 - License and registration, ma'am.\\
96 - All right.\\
97 - Don't think I don't know what this is all about.\\
98 - It's 'cause I made you pay for that ice tea.\\
99 - Oh, was that you?\\
100 - Now, you just sit tight.\\
101 - I got to do some paperwork, run a computer check.\\
102 - It may take a little while.\\
103 - The computer's kind of slow.\\
104 - Yeah, well, knock yourself out.\\
105 - My record is clean.\\
106 - There is no way I have 16 unpaid parking tickets.\\
107 - The computer's wrong!\\
108 - You are not getting away with this!\\
109 - Hey, Mom, is this a bad time to tell you\\
110 - I got kicked out out of shop class?\\
111 - I mean, it seems to pale in comparison.\\
112 - Chin up, Lois.\\
113 - I'll make sure the boys get home.\\
114 - I'll wait for you.\\
115 - I want you boys to behave for Craig.\\
116 - And, Dewey, don't be frightened.\\
117 - Mama's going to be okay.\\
118 - Can you turn on your siren?\\
119 - Sure.\\
120 - Yay!\\
121 - Come on, honey.\\
122 - You got to admit it was kind of sexy--\\
123 - me having to bail you out of jail.\\
124 - Well, it was sexy for me.\\
125 - Oh, yeah, Hal, it was a real turn-on\\
126 - sitting there wondering how my children were doing,\\
127 - what horrible things are going through their heads\\
128 - knowing that their mother is sitting in jail.\\
129 - Hey, Mom, did you get tattooed?\\
130 - I don't understand.\\
131 - How could we get 16 parking tickets\\
132 - and not even know about it?\\
133 - Mom, just calm down!\\
134 - I was in jail, Francis! Jail!\\
135 - All because you didn't pay your parking tickets!\\
136 - How could you have gotten 16 parking tickets?!\\
137 - It's not my fault. You keep me stuck here.\\
138 - When I come home, I have so much living to do,\\
139 - I don't have time to look for legal parking.\\
140 - You listen, mister-- your irresponsible behavior\\
141 - has finally caught up with you,\\
142 - and you are going to suffer the consequences!\\
143 - You are paying those parking tickets!\\
144 - You know, Mom, jail has really hardened you.\\
145 - I'm serious, Francis, you are paying us back\\
146 - that money for those tickets\\
147 - plus $145 to get the car out of impound.\\
148 - That means you owe us $747.13.\\
149 - This is totally unfair!\\
150 - None of this would have happened\\
151 - if you weren't such a reckless driver.\\
152 - Excuse me?\\
153 - When I parked too close to a mailbox,\\
154 - I didn't endanger anybody's life.\\
155 - I didn't endanger anyone.\\
156 - I was pulled over by a corrupt cop\\
157 - for a traffic violation that I didn't commit.\\
158 - Oh, but when I tell you I've been framed by the police,\\
159 - you send me to military school.\\
160 - Ironic, isn't it?\\
161 - That cop was out to get me.\\
162 - Of course he was.\\
163 - Everyone's out to get you.\\
164 - And the neighbor's cat's the ringleader.\\
165 - Didn't you know that?\\
166 - Ha-ha, you can laugh all you want, Francis,\\
167 - but until you come up with the money,\\
168 - you are not coming home.\\
169 - Where am I supposed to get $700?\\
170 - You're just using this as an excuse to keep me here.\\
171 - Yeah, that's right. It was the cat's idea.\\
172 - Mom, there's no way\\
173 - Francis can come up with that kind of money.\\
174 - Which is what he should have thought of\\
175 - before he did that bad, bad thing.\\
176 - Honey, don't worry about a thing.\\
177 - Everything's going to be fine.\\
178 - Francis will think of something.\\
179 - I hear they've made traffic school really fun.\\
180 - They have cooking traffic school,\\
181 - bowling traffic school.\\
182 - Remember when I took that comedy traffic school?\\
183 - I mean, God, that was hilarious.\\
184 - A rabbi, a priest and a minister come to a four-way stop...\\
185 - I am not taking traffic school.\\
186 - Honey, if you don't take traffic school,\\
187 - you'll get a point on your license.\\
188 - I'm not getting a point on my license\\
189 - because I'm taking this to court.\\
190 - I did nothing wrong\\
191 - and I've got three eyewitnesses to prove it.\\
192 - They saw exactly what happened.\\
193 - Blah, blah, blah.\\
194 - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\\
195 - Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.\\
196 - Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.\\
197 - Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey\\
198 - Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, Dewey.\\
199 - Exactly what you said, Mom.\\
200 - You're right, Mom. Right.\\
201 - See, Hal, it's a clear case of entrapment.\\
202 - The cop doesn't get his free ice tea\\
203 - so he trumps up a cockamamy ticket.\\
204 - Well, we're going to fight this.\\
205 - Well, honey, let's think about this a second.\\
206 - You know it's going to be your word against his,\\
207 - and judges usually side with the police.\\
208 - Yeah, that's what he's counting on.\\
209 - That's why he thinks he can get away with lying.\\
210 - Well, I'm not going to let him\\
211 - 'cause I know I'm right.\\
212 - I know that, honey,\\
213 - but what if something does go wrong?\\
214 - I mean, I'm not sure\\
215 - we can afford the bump in the insurance.\\
216 - I am not going to lose.\\
217 - I'm in the right and I'll find a way to prove it.\\
218 - Okay, okay, if that's what you want to do.\\
219 - You have our total support.\\
220 - Just remember, Mom, in a world of lies,\\
221 - truth is your only weapon.\\
222 - What? It's not?\\
223 - Thank you.\\
224 - Howdy, ma'am.\\
225 - How was jail?\\
226 - Fine, thank you.\\
227 - Shouldn't you be out planting drugs on someone?\\
228 - Yes, I was planning to go do that\\
229 - right after I pay full price for my ice tea.\\
230 - I'm fighting the ticket, you know.\\
231 - Well, then, I look forward to seeing you in court.\\
232 - Drive safely...\\
233 - whenever you get your car back.\\
234 - There is no way that cop could have seen me pull out.\\
235 - Yeah?\\
236 - Mom, great news.\\
237 - Francis, I'm a little busy here.\\
238 - Okay, here it is.\\
239 - I just sent you $20 good-faith money...\\
240 - Great. Only $727 more before you can come home.\\
241 - What?\\
242 - Francis, I am not going to let you weasel out\\
243 - of your responsibility.\\
244 - Because of you, we are down to one car\\
245 - until your father's next paycheck.\\
246 - Now, you either come up with the money\\
247 - or you don't come home.\\
248 - Mom, it's impossible. I'm in school.\\
249 - When I'm not in school, I have homework.\\
250 - When I'm not doing homework, I'm in detention.\\
251 - If I'm lucky, I have six hours free a week.\\
252 - At minimum wage\\
253 - I wouldn't be able to make it home until Thanksgiving 2010.\\
254 - You bring the yams.\\
255 - He'll find the money.\\
256 - Hey, do you know where Craig is?\\
257 - Your assistant manager?\\
258 - Big guy, smells like cabbage?\\
259 - Thanks.\\
260 - Uh-uh, it's not there.\\
261 - Keep looking...\\
262 - Lower...\\
263 - Craig, Mom said you can give me a ride to study group.\\
264 - Sure, sure.\\
265 - What are you doing?\\
266 - I was, uh, uh, reviewing some old security tapes.\\
267 - You know, looking for a pattern.\\
268 - See if anyone was casing the joint.\\
269 - You can't be too careful.\\
270 - Hey, that girl's stealing something.\\
271 - Oh, I, I didn't notice that.\\
272 - I'd better review her other tapes, then.\\
273 - Wait. Are there cameras all over this place?\\
274 - Oh, yeah, they're everywhere:\\
275 - pharmacy, ATM, the bath...\\
276 - Uh, yep, lot of cameras.\\
277 - Is there one in the parking lot?\\
278 - Whoa!\\
279 - What is it?\\
280 - That girl dropped a can under her car.\\
281 - Sorry.\\
282 - Wait! Stop!\\
283 - There's our van.\\
284 - She did it.\\
285 - She's guilty.\\
286 - Mom's... wrong.\\
287 - Oh, my God.\\
288 - Mom's wrong.\\
289 - My whole worldview is shaken.\\
290 - I know. This is amazing.\\
291 - We have to go show it to her.\\
292 - Wait, maybe we should save it\\
293 - for the next time Mom yells at us,\\
294 - then spring it on her.\\
295 - No, I think it's better fresh.\\
296 - Okay, let's go. Wait, we need to keep a straight face.\\
297 - Okay, okay.\\
298 - I'm ready.\\
299 - No, I'm not.\\
300 - Stop smiling.\\
301 - Come on...\\
302 - Hey, honey.\\
303 - God, it's been a great day.\\
304 - The fire alarm went off during the morning meeting,\\
305 - and I got the last Snickers out of the vending machine.\\
306 - I did not think it was going to fall,\\
307 - but then I gave it a little hip check-- boom!\\
308 - Who is Susan King?\\
309 - Hmm?\\
310 - Susan King.\\
311 - Hmm, Susan King.\\
312 - Give me a moment.\\
313 - Susan...\\
314 - All right, before I say anything,\\
315 - do you know already or are you really asking?\\
316 - She called today with some insurance quotes\\
317 - in case I get a point on my license.\\
318 - Why would she do that?\\
319 - It was nothing.\\
320 - I just gave her a little phone call.\\
321 - Curious about a few things.\\
322 - Like what will happen if I lose?\\
323 - Well, yes, yes, I just wanted to find out\\
324 - what the worst-case scenario might be.\\
325 - I mean, what if...\\
326 - There are no "what ifs," Hal!\\
327 - You're right.\\
328 - You are right.\\
329 - Right, okay.\\
330 - So, I mean, even if our insurance does go up\\
331 - and we can't afford two cars, we'll just sell one.\\
332 - I mean, you know, what did they do before cars?\\
333 - They, uh, they walked, so we'll walk.\\
334 - You're expecting me to lose.\\
335 - Is this how you support me?\\
336 - I do support you.\\
337 - I'm just-- I think we need\\
338 - to know what we're getting into here.\\
339 - I mean, I don't know.\\
340 - Is, is it actually worth all the trouble?\\
341 - Yes, Hal.\\
342 - I think standing up for myself is worth the trouble!\\
343 - I think refusing to be railroaded is worth the trouble!\\
344 - I know I can win this because I know I'm right!\\
345 - I can't believe you have so little faith in me!\\
346 - I have complete faith in you.\\
347 - It's the rest of the world that I don't have faith in.\\
348 - Things could look different\\
349 - to different people.\\
350 - The system can be corrupt.\\
351 - We wouldn't be in this situation if that weren't true.\\
352 - And sometimes, Lois, being right isn't enough.\\
353 - Being right is everything.\\
354 - I didn't do anything wrong, Hal,\\
355 - and I'm willing to fight to prove it.\\
356 - I know it's going to be hard.\\
357 - But that's why the last thing I need\\
358 - is my own family undermining me.\\
359 - How many times do I have to tell you?\\
360 - I'm right, I'm right.\\
361 - I swear on my children's lives, I am right!\\
362 - What do you want?\\
363 - Nothing.\\
364 - I can't believe you chickened out.\\
365 - Me? You're the one who disappeared.\\
366 - Oh, so now we're playing the blame game.\\
367 - Look, we know Mom is going to freak out\\
368 - on whoever shows her the tape...\\
369 - Not it. Maybe someone could\\
370 - mail it to her anonymously...\\
371 - Not it. Okay, fine, but I'm going to need...\\
372 - Not it.\\
373 - Look...\\
374 - someone has to be the person...\\
375 - Not it. Who doesn't give it to her.\\
376 - I'm it.\\
377 - Ha!\\
378 - Oh.\\
379 - Let me get this straight:\\
380 - We each pay you $50 and you're going to jump\\
381 - from the roof of the dorm to the roof of the gym\\
382 - on the school's riding lawnmower.\\
383 - Who's in?\\
384 - Are we talking with the bagger attachment?\\
385 - Are you crazy?\\
386 - You know what kind of drag that would create?\\
387 - I don't know.\\
388 - It just sounds too easy.\\
389 - Okay, okay, how about this:\\
390 - For five extra dollars, I'll do it blindfolded.\\
391 - Francis, phone.\\
392 - Give it some thought.\\
393 - Hello?\\
394 - Hey, Francis.\\
395 - You know Mom's traffic ticket?\\
396 - Well, I have a videotape,\\
397 - and it shows that Mom really was at fault, and...\\
398 - She was wrong?\\
399 - Yeah, and now I'm trying to figure...\\
400 - What are you talking to me for?\\
401 - You have incontrovertible proof that Mom was wrong.\\
402 - Shove it in her face.\\
403 - Francis, I don't think that's a good idea.\\
404 - Are you kidding? It's brilliant.\\
405 - From now on, whenever she gets all high-and-mighty with us,\\
406 - we can just throw this back at her.\\
407 - Francis, I can't.\\
408 - If I show Mom this tape, she'll go crazy\\
409 - and then she'll kill the messenger, which is me.\\
410 - You're asking me to commit suicide.\\
411 - And think of the look on her face!\\
412 - We thought it would be best if we showed it to you first.\\
413 - Well, I can't say that I'm glad you did,\\
414 - but I-I guess you did the right thing.\\
415 - Someone should show it to her.\\
416 - Not it. Dad!\\
417 - Okay, but we need to ease her into this.\\
418 - Pick the right moment.\\
419 - This is a very delicate matter.\\
420 - Hal!\\
421 - Come on, come on, come on, come on...\\
422 - I swear, that cop\\
423 - was following me on the way home.\\
424 - Oh, come on, Lois.\\
425 - I don't think he'd follow you.\\
426 - I'm sure he's got better things to do.\\
427 - What do you think you're doing here?\\
428 - My commander informed me\\
429 - that you made a request for my records,\\
430 - which, of course, is your right,\\
431 - so I thought I'd take a drive over\\
432 - and deliver them to you myself.\\
433 - Nice house.\\
434 - Don't you try to intimidate me.\\
435 - All I said was you have a nice house.\\
436 - First you follow me home and now you're making vague threats?\\
437 - Well, it's not going to work.\\
438 - You are going to be so sorry you messed with me.\\
439 - Have a nice evening, ma'am.\\
440 - You are going down, mister.\\
441 - You hear me?!\\
442 - You are going down!\\
443 - I don't care how long it takes or how much money it costs!\\
444 - I'm going to win because I am right!\\
445 - There's something you have to see.\\
446 - Honey, I'm sorry you had to see that,\\
447 - but it's best you found out now before it's too late.\\
448 - It's wrong.\\
449 - What?\\
450 - The tape is wrong.\\
451 - Dad...\\
452 - You heard your mother.\\
453 - The tape... is...\\
454 - Oh, man!\\
455 - Honey...\\
456 - Look, I'm not stupid.\\
457 - I saw the tape.\\
458 - But it's wrong.\\
459 - I don't know how to explain it, but I know.\\
460 - I know that tape is wrong.\\
461 - I believe you. No, you don't.\\
462 - Well, what do you expect?\\
463 - I expect you to believe me.\\
464 - Lois, in the past 20 years\\
465 - you have never admitted that you were wrong.\\
466 - And as far as I know, you've never needed to.\\
467 - But the facts are right there in front of your eyes,\\
468 - and this time you are wrong.\\
469 - And if you can't see that,\\
470 - well, that's just plain crazy.\\
471 - I am not crazy.\\
472 - The tape is wrong. It has to be.\\
473 - Well, wha-what are you saying, that someone doctored it?\\
474 - No, I...\\
475 - I, I-I know... I know it wasn't doctored.\\
476 - I'm just saying that it's wrong.\\
477 - I know what happened, and I know that I'm right.\\
478 - Okay, honey, that may be,\\
479 - but me and the rest of the world tend to believe what we see,\\
480 - and everything is pointing to you being wrong.\\
481 - The universe is telling you to give up.\\
482 - It's time to let it go.\\
483 - Well, that's not fair.\\
484 - You know what's not fair, Lois?\\
485 - Having to be right all the time.\\
486 - That's a terrible burden.\\
487 - Wouldn't it be a relief\\
488 - just to let go?\\
489 - You want me to say that I'm wrong\\
490 - even when I know I'm right?\\
491 - Yes, yes, that's exactly what I want.\\
492 - I know\\
493 - it doesn't happen very often, Lois,\\
494 - but you have been beaten.\\
495 - Let go.\\
496 - But I am right.\\
497 - Let go, honey. But I...\\
498 - Just once.\\
499 - Can you do that?\\
500 - Let go.\\
501 - That's it.\\
502 - Aw, see?\\
503 - Okay...\\
504 - Okay, can you say it?\\
505 - I was...\\
506 - wrong.\\
507 - That's right.\\
508 - You see, it's not so bad.\\
509 - Hmm?\\
510 - You'll go to traffic school\\
511 - and meet some nice people,\\
512 - maybe hear a couple good car jokes.\\
513 - Huh?\\
514 - Everything is...\\
515 - Everything's going to be all right, okay?\\
516 - Everything's going to be all right.\\
517 - Oh, I am so proud of you.\\
518 - You are so great.\\
519 - You are so beautiful.\\
520 - You are so wrong.\\
521 - How many times have I told you people\\
522 - don't leave the refrigerator open!\\
523 - You did it.\\
524 - Maybe I did.\\
525 - She's been like this all week.\\
526 - It's like her spirit's been broken.\\
527 - It's nice.\\
528 - Hi, Francis-- about the money...\\
529 - Okay, look, I've raised 192 bucks, and if I can only...\\
530 - Look, Francis, I'm sorry I got so angry.\\
531 - Why don't you just use that money to come home next weekend?\\
532 - But...\\
533 - I've got to go to traffic school. Love you. Bye.\\
534 - Bye.\\
535 - Where's Lois, did I miss her?\\
536 - Craig.\\
537 - You guys are not going to believe what I have.\\
538 - I have a surveillance\\
539 - arrangement with the manager\\
540 - of the mini-mart across the street.\\
541 - We exchange tapes in order to better understand\\
542 - the security needs of our customers.\\
543 - "Short skirt, windy day"?\\
544 - That's code.\\
545 - Anyhoo, one of their cameras\\
546 - caught Lois from a different angle\\
547 - right before she got her ticket.\\
548 - See?\\
549 - Lois was right all along!\\
550 - This completely exonerates her.\\
551 - Isn't this great?\\
552 - What are you doing?\\
553 - You will never, ever tell her of this.\\
554 - But...\\
555 - Ah! Ever.\\
556 - Got it?
\subsection {Episode 17: Surgery}
1 - Okay, I think I fixed the leak.\\
2 - Let me just reattach this here.\\
3 - Try it now.\\
4 - Now there's hot water coming out of both taps.\\
5 - What?\\
6 - Is that really so bad?\\
7 - You always complain there's not enough hot water.\\
8 - It wouldn't kill you to hire a professional\\
9 - every once in a while.\\
10 - It costs $70 just to get them in the house.\\
11 - Look, I know my work isn't perfect,\\
12 - but I am saving us a ton of money,\\
13 - and at least the job gets done.\\
14 - Now, if you'll excuse me, there's someone at the door.\\
15 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
16 -     I don't know    \\
17 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     Life is unfair.    \\
27 - The tension is palpable here at the 8,215th\\
28 - Daily Shaving Olympics.\\
29 - Hal has lost crucial seconds in his lathering,\\
30 - but he hopes to make it up with his blade work.\\
31 - This is for the gold.\\
32 - Hal, boys, breakfast!\\
33 - Bacon Day!\\
34 - Dewey, don't be scared,\\
35 - but there's a big spider next to you.\\
36 - Yeah, Dad. There's always a spider on Bacon Day.\\
37 - You know, I'm not feeling that good.\\
38 - I could give Dad some of mine,\\
39 - but that's not really in the true spirit of Bacon Day.\\
40 - Mom, my stomach hurts.\\
41 - So does mine.\\
42 - I'm not kidding, it's really sore.\\
43 - Ow! It hurts!\\
44 - Shut up, Reese.\\
45 - Mom... I see spots!\\
46 - Mommy!\\
47 - All right, that's enough.\\
48 - I don't care what test you didn't study for\\
49 - or what assignment you didn't do,\\
50 - you're going to school.\\
51 - You know, now that you mention it...\\
52 - Everybody's  going.\\
53 - Sir, what are you doing?\\
54 - Why are you taking away our TV?\\
55 - It's for your own good, cadet.\\
56 - But that is the only thing that makes this place bearable.\\
57 - Television rots the mind, cadet.\\
58 - How can you focus on your studies\\
59 - and improve your character\\
60 - if your brain is full of your Morks and your Mindys?\\
61 - Now you'll have time for more worthwhile endeavors.\\
62 - Write a letter. I'm sure your parole officers\\
63 - will appreciate the personal touch.\\
64 - Okay, that is ridiculous.\\
65 - I mean, we should do something.\\
66 - He's right.\\
67 - Spangler doesn't get to make arbitrary decisions\\
68 - about our lives.\\
69 - He can't tell us where to go and what to do.\\
70 - Oh, wait... he can.\\
71 - Face it, Francis,\\
72 - we're like prisoners but without the rights.\\
73 - Okay, so we're helpless.\\
74 - But even helpless people have options.\\
75 - History is full of supposedly powerless people\\
76 - who found a way to stand up to their oppressors.\\
77 - What are you talking about?\\
78 - Civil disobedience.\\
79 - You know, like a hunger strike.\\
80 - We could do that.\\
81 - I mean, he doesn't want a bunch of starving kids on his hands.\\
82 - That would totally work.\\
83 - I don't know.\\
84 - Isn't that a bit drastic?\\
85 - Can't we wait till after lunch?\\
86 - What are we having? Shepherd's pie.\\
87 - The strike starts now!\\
88 - Malcolm, why are you walking like that?\\
89 - My side still hurts.\\
90 - But it's the weekend.\\
91 - Okay, everybody get in the car.\\
92 - We're going to the hospital.\\
93 - Mom, why does that man have a lightbulb stuck...\\
94 - Dewey, get away from there.\\
95 - Dad, you okay?\\
96 - I'm fine, son.\\
97 - Just not a big fan of hospitals.\\
98 - Oh, they can dress it up with plants and pictures,\\
99 - but let's face it, this place is a slaughterhouse.\\
100 - Hal...\\
101 - Okay, we've run some tests.\\
102 - His white count is 12.2,\\
103 - and with these acute abdominal pains,\\
104 - I'm pretty sure we're looking at appendicitis.\\
105 - We'll hold him\\
106 - for observation tonight,\\
107 - and then tomorrow he'll probably need surgery.\\
108 - I'm having surgery?\\
109 - There's nothing to worry about, son.\\
110 - You'll barely even have a scar.\\
111 - If you can just sign these release forms,\\
112 - we'll check him in.\\
113 - They're going to cut you open?\\
114 - Like a trout.\\
115 - Don't worry, you won't feel a thing;\\
116 - you'll be unconscious.\\
117 - Not necessarily.\\
118 - I saw this thing on TV where this guy woke up\\
119 - in the middle of his operation\\
120 - and could feel everything they were doing,\\
121 - but he was paralyzed and couldn't even scream.\\
122 - Reese, for the love of God, stop talking.\\
123 - Mom... Honey, don't worry about it.\\
124 - You're going to have your own TV,\\
125 - you're going to have people to wait on you;\\
126 - it's going to be a lot better\\
127 - than being at home.\\
128 - Why do I have to stay in the kids' ward?\\
129 - I'm sorry, honey, but you're six months too young\\
130 - to have an adult room.\\
131 - I hear if you're really good,\\
132 - they'll put apple juice in your sippy cup.\\
133 - Dad, do you want to wait out in the car?\\
134 - No. I'm okay.\\
135 - I'm fine.\\
136 - I'm on a beach.\\
137 - There's the surf, there's sand,\\
138 - there's... needles.\\
139 - There's the horrible choking stench of hospital antiseptic.\\
140 - Hal!\\
141 - Coming.\\
142 - I think I better take your father home.\\
143 - You'll be okay.\\
144 - Hey, feel better, sport.\\
145 - Reese, give your brother a hug.\\
146 - Aw, Mom.\\
147 - Do it!\\
148 - If you tell anyone I hugged you,\\
149 - I'll put you right back in here.\\
150 - Bye.\\
151 - Why did she make him hug me?\\
152 - Wait. Why  did  she make him hug me?\\
153 - Wow, it's sure quiet without Malcolm here.\\
154 - Poor little guy.\\
155 - There's an extra pork chop. Mine!\\
156 - Go ahead. I'm stuffed.\\
157 - Me, too.\\
158 - So am I.\\
159 - I was just hoping someone would fight me for it.\\
160 - Hey, can we play "March and Conquer"?\\
161 - That game's no fun.\\
162 - Malcolm always creams us in, like, five minutes.\\
163 - Yeah, can we?\\
164 - I... don't know.\\
165 - Please?\\
166 - We need at least three people or we can't play.\\
167 - Oh, all right.\\
168 - Okay, Lois,\\
169 - let's see how well you defend the Black Sea\\
170 - without Bosporus and the Dardanelles.\\
171 - Yeah, yeah, just wait.\\
172 - Wow, it's been an hour and I'm still in the game.\\
173 - I usually tip the board over way before now.\\
174 - Guess what?\\
175 - We look just like the family on the box.\\
176 - Oh, yeah.\\
177 - Can I be the little girl?\\
178 - Not on my watch, son.\\
179 - You want to play "Go Fish"?\\
180 - No. I didn't want to play five minutes ago.\\
181 - I didn't want to play an hour ago.\\
182 - I don't want to play!\\
183 - You got any fives?\\
184 - And this is our inflamed appendix.\\
185 - The patient arrived today complaining\\
186 - of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant.\\
187 - Ow!\\
188 - We're going to have to start him on an I.V.\\
189 - Cathryn?\\
190 - Oh, God.\\
191 - Not me again.\\
192 - Please!\\
193 - It'll be fine this time, Cathryn.\\
194 - Accidents happen.\\
195 - Can maybe someone else... Helmut will hold him still.\\
196 - If you feel pain,\\
197 - you can bite down on his hand just as hard as you want.\\
198 - Helmut won't mind.\\
199 - How long has it been since we ate?\\
200 - 33 hours, 12 minutes.\\
201 - Oh, man, they're serving dinner right now.\\
202 - Ten-hut!\\
203 - I found myself eating the last several meals alone.\\
204 - Are we dieting?\\
205 - Don't tell me it's prom season already.\\
206 - We're on a hunger strike, sir.\\
207 - We're not eating until you return the television.\\
208 - Ah... passive resistance.\\
209 - The last resort of slackers and sissies.\\
210 - What about Gandhi?\\
211 - Sissy.\\
212 - We're making a stand here, sir.\\
213 - We will not back down until we get justice.\\
214 - Now let me see if I've got this straight.\\
215 - I get to continue to eat, but you don't.\\
216 - Ooh, I feel the pressure already.\\
217 - Ow, make it stop.\\
218 -        \\
219 - Go, Mom! Nice!\\
220 - Go, Mom!\\
221 - Okay, you can do this the easy way\\
222 - and surrender with dignity,\\
223 - or I can destroy you.\\
224 - You forget, I still have Antarctica,\\
225 - gateway to New Zealand.\\
226 - You got nothing.\\
227 - Any roll other than three,\\
228 - and the world is mine.\\
229 - Three, three, three.\\
230 - Three.\\
231 - Yeah! Yay! Yes!\\
232 - Oh, sorry, honey, you tried really hard.\\
233 - And for a while there, I thought you might actually be...\\
234 - Rematch.\\
235 - All right.\\
236 - Hal, it's after midnight. Rematch.\\
237 - Set up the board.\\
238 - I'll do it.\\
239 - Here he is.\\
240 - What?\\
241 - You just keep quiet. You're in good hands.\\
242 - This is to keep your head still\\
243 - so Mr. Laser can do his job.\\
244 - Huh?\\
245 - Psst.\\
246 - Shh.\\
247 - Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad. They made me use a bedpan\\
248 - even though I could walk.\\
249 - They turned off the lights at 6:30 so I couldn't even read.\\
250 - And last night, some man put a metal cage on my head.\\
251 - They were going to operate on my brain.\\
252 - Bedpan.\\
253 - Sweetie, I'm sure\\
254 - it was just a bad dream.\\
255 - Besides, I'm feeling a lot better now.\\
256 - I don't even think I need surgery.\\
257 - It's okay. Surgery makes everybody a little scared.\\
258 - Trust me, this is going to be over before you know it.\\
259 - Between the stench of disease\\
260 - and all those waffles, I don't feel very well.\\
261 - What waffles?\\
262 - Oh, man, you missed it.\\
263 - We went to Pancake Pete's.\\
264 - We never go out to breakfast.\\
265 - Well, we stayed up late playing March and Conquer,\\
266 - and your mother was too tired to cook.\\
267 - You guys played March and Conquer without me?\\
268 - Oh, Malcolm, you didn't miss anything last night.\\
269 - These guys are a bunch of pushovers.\\
270 - Pushovers? I held Kamchatka for three hours.\\
271 - Look, we're going to take the boys home,\\
272 - and then your dad and I will be back\\
273 - in time for your operation, okay?\\
274 - Dewey, you're wearing my shirt.\\
275 - Am I?\\
276 - I'm so hungry.\\
277 - I think we proved our point.\\
278 - Guys, this hunger strike will only work if we stick together.\\
279 - Now, we can do this.\\
280 - Our stomachs have shrunk.\\
281 - The hardest part is over.\\
282 - Good morning, cadets.\\
283 - I must say, it is inspiring\\
284 - to see young men with the courage\\
285 - to stand up for the things they believe in.\\
286 - Two whole days.\\
287 - What an impressive show of civil disobedience.\\
288 - That's the kind of intestinal fortitude\\
289 - that can only be properly honored by an omelet bar.\\
290 - Tempting us with food isn't going to work, sir.\\
291 - Of course not.\\
292 - These delicious eggs\\
293 - and choice of scrumptious fillings are for me.\\
294 - Now, here's my dilemma.\\
295 - What shall I put in my omelet?\\
296 - Black forest ham?\\
297 - Imported cheese?\\
298 - Porcini mushrooms?\\
299 - Porcini?\\
300 - Oh, what the heck!\\
301 - Give me the works.\\
302 - Mmm.\\
303 - There's our fallen comrade.\\
304 - I love Room 124.\\
305 - When's the...\\
306 - appendix...\\
307 - coming out?\\
308 - Tonight, but-- I don't know-- I'm feeling better.\\
309 - Maybe I don't need the operation.\\
310 - What are you talking about?!\\
311 - Of course you need the operation!\\
312 - But what if... Don't you understand?\\
313 - You're sitting on a gold mine.\\
314 - Ride the guilt train, baby, as far as it'll take you.\\
315 - My adenoids got me this watch.\\
316 - My strangulated testicle got me a week at Disneyland.\\
317 - I'm one.... procedure...\\
318 - from a...\\
319 - Range Rover.\\
320 - Well, we got two hours till we have to\\
321 - go back to the hospital.\\
322 - You want to order in or eat leftovers?\\
323 - Well, I'd say "you decide,"\\
324 - but then I'd be a pushover, wouldn't I?\\
325 - What are you talking about?\\
326 - March and Conquer.\\
327 - You called me a pushover.\\
328 - Don't deny it.\\
329 - Come on, honey, I trounced you.\\
330 - Just because you got all the good dice rolls\\
331 - and you weren't saddled with Brazil to protect.\\
332 - A-And I wouldn't call it "trounced."\\
333 - What would you say?\\
334 - Demolished?\\
335 - Creamed?\\
336 - Annihilated?\\
337 - Get the board.\\
338 - How are you, Tiger?\\
339 - I want you to note the bedside manner.\\
340 - Dr. Harrison, I'm glad you're here.\\
341 - I wanted to talk to you.\\
342 - I feeling a lot better now,\\
343 - and my temperature's been down for six hours,\\
344 - and I'm thinking that maybe my first blood test\\
345 - wasn't accurate.\\
346 - Now, this is what we call a hysterical patient.\\
347 - I'm not hysterical.\\
348 - I just think it'd be smart to run another blood test\\
349 - before you commit to cutting me open.\\
350 - Why, that's a terrific idea.\\
351 - Really terrific.\\
352 - We'll see you later.\\
353 - What's wrong with you people?!\\
354 - Labs make mistakes!\\
355 - Listen to me!\\
356 - I declare war on that blue country!\\
357 - Reese, why are you attacking me?\\
358 - Your dad's wide open.\\
359 - What are you saying, Lois,\\
360 - that the boys and I have formed a secret alliance against you?\\
361 - Hal, that's my foot you're tapping Morse code onto.\\
362 - I can't take this anymore.\\
363 - If I don't eat soon, I'm going to pass out.\\
364 - This isn't worth it.\\
365 - I agree with Finley.\\
366 - Who are you?\\
367 - Your roommate.\\
368 - Oh. Yeah.\\
369 - Hey, after the luau, you want to go parasailing?\\
370 - What?\\
371 - Snap out of it.\\
372 - You're talking crazy.\\
373 - Why would we have a luau\\
374 - when we're trapped in a disabled submarine?\\
375 - Wait.\\
376 - I hear tapping.\\
377 - Come on, guys, we're doing good.\\
378 - I think we're on the right track here.\\
379 - If we keep this up, Commandant...\\
380 - Uh...\\
381 - Spangler?\\
382 - Yes. Spangler.\\
383 - Commandant Spangler will have no choice\\
384 - but to meet our demands.\\
385 - Francis?\\
386 - It's time we talked.\\
387 - Will you gentlemen excuse us, please?\\
388 - Take your time.\\
389 - Yes! Madagascar is mine!\\
390 - Let me see those dice.\\
391 - Are you accusing me of cheating?!\\
392 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
393 - That's the pizza delivery man.\\
394 - Why don't you get it?\\
395 - So my artillery can mysteriously disappear\\
396 - like it did when I went to get a glass of water.\\
397 - Or when I went to the bathroom\\
398 - and your tanks just materialized on my border.\\
399 - I'm not getting it.\\
400 - Come in!\\
401 - It's locked!\\
402 - Try the window!\\
403 - What?!\\
404 - Haven't you ever delivered pizza before?!\\
405 - Come in through the window!\\
406 - It's locked, too!\\
407 - Okay, thanks anyway!\\
408 - Here. Take this.\\
409 - What's this for?\\
410 - Sedatives.\\
411 - Your surgery has been moved up.\\
412 - What do you mean, moved up?\\
413 - My parents aren't even here.\\
414 - I'm sure they've been notified.\\
415 - Look, I'm not taking these\\
416 - until after I get another blood test.\\
417 - Take the pills.\\
418 - No! I'm not going to!\\
419 - You can't force...\\
420 - I know you are frightened,\\
421 - and that is normal for a little boy.\\
422 - But now you must let the grown-ups handle things.\\
423 - All you have to do is relax and let the pills take effect.\\
424 - That's a good boy.\\
425 - It's your move, Reese.\\
426 - What are you going to do?\\
427 - I don't know!\\
428 - I'm hungry.\\
429 - Reese, if you attack me, you're grounded.\\
430 - If you don't attack her, you're grounded!\\
431 - Stop it!\\
432 - I don't want to play anymore!\\
433 - I hate this game.\\
434 - It's never been this horrible,\\
435 - even when Malcolm was kicking our butts.\\
436 - He's right.\\
437 - Look what we've become.\\
438 - Without Malcolm humiliating us,\\
439 - our worst competitive instincts took over.\\
440 - I'm ashamed for all of us.\\
441 - So, you're quitting?\\
442 - Let it go, Lois.\\
443 - Ah, you're right.\\
444 - Reese, do the honors.\\
445 - Good. Now, who wants to go outside\\
446 - and watch me burn the evil game?\\
447 - I have to admit, cadet,\\
448 - I thought you boys would have surrendered by now,\\
449 - but instead, you have shown\\
450 - strength of will, teamwork,\\
451 - and a willingness to sacrifice.\\
452 - Well done.\\
453 - With what?\\
454 - The strike.\\
455 - Right, right, the strike.\\
456 - Well, that's good, 'cause...\\
457 - we weren't going to do...\\
458 - the thing... until we got back...\\
459 - Well, you know.\\
460 - Yes, I believe I do.\\
461 - Shall we discuss terms?\\
462 - We did it.\\
463 - The strike's over.\\
464 - We won!\\
465 - We got his magic hat!\\
466 - What about the television?\\
467 - Huh?\\
468 - Here's your blood test, man.\\
469 - Thanks. Here's my urine.\\
470 - Good luck on the drug test,\\
471 - but I really think you should get some help.\\
472 - I knew it!\\
473 - Oh, good-- Helmut.\\
474 - I've been looking all over for you.\\
475 - I have great news.\\
476 - You see, I just had another blood test,\\
477 - and it shows that I really don't need surgery, because...\\
478 - If the blood count goes down to normal,\\
479 - that means it isn't appendicitis.\\
480 - It was probably just a transient infection\\
481 - or maybe even a cold sore.\\
482 - Yes, little boy.\\
483 - I need... to talk to Dr. Harrison.\\
484 - Count backwards from a hundred.\\
485 - Hi there, sport.\\
486 - We'll have that appendix out in no time.\\
487 - Okay, scalpel.\\
488 - Huh? Hold on a second.\\
489 - "Do not operate.\\
490 - 'H' and 'H': 16 and 47, platelets: 310..."\\
491 - These are blood test results.\\
492 - "White count: 8.4"?\\
493 - Is that right?\\
494 - "I will sue your ass for malpract..."\\
495 - Uh, maybe we should run another blood test.\\
496 - Spangler was right.\\
497 - Who needs television?\\
498 - This is nice.\\
499 - Get some fresh air, some exercise.\\
500 - Nice drive.\\
501 - Thanks.\\
502 - I think this hat is magic.\\
503 - Right, Francis?\\
504 - Uh-huh.\\
505 - Oh, remember to replace your divots.\\
506 - There's nothing like two days at the hospital\\
507 - to make you appreciate your own home.\\
508 - Give me that!\\
509 - Oh, my God!\\
510 - Look at Malcolm's hospital bill.\\
511 - I'd hate to think what it'd cost\\
512 - if he'd actually had the operation.\\
513 - There goes our summer vacation.\\
514 - So we have to pay even though he was faking?\\
515 - I wasn't faking.\\
516 - I'm the one who figured out they were wrong, remember?\\
517 - Well, if you're such a genius,\\
518 - why didn't you figure it out sooner?\\
519 - Well, son, you want to answer that for us all?\\
520 - Nothing like ten seconds at home\\
521 - to make you appreciate the hospital.
\subsection {Episode 18: Reese Cooks}
1 - I had a bad dream.\\
2 - It's okay, sweetie.\\
3 - Here, come on.\\
4 - Come on.\\
5 - It's okay now.\\
6 - What was your dream?\\
7 - I dreamed...\\
8 - there was this man... outside the door\\
9 - with a big knife...\\
10 - and he wanted to tie everyone up...\\
11 - and kill them...\\
12 - and eat their eyeballs.\\
13 - Good night.\\
14 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
15 -     I don't know    \\
16 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - Hey. What you doing there, son?\\
27 - I have to prove Kepler's third law of planetary motion.\\
28 - What's Dewey doing? He's coloring.\\
29 - Well, I'd better get in there.\\
30 - Dad, there's this crazy guy chasing me.\\
31 - He's saying I did some horrible things,\\
32 - but I couldn't really understand him.\\
33 - I think he's an escapee from the mental hospital.\\
34 - I didn't hear anything.\\
35 - Hello again, Hal.\\
36 - You are not to step foot outside of this house\\
37 - except for school for the next month!\\
38 - Okay. Wait a minute, honey, he has to go outside.\\
39 - He's not done pulling weeds from his last punishment.\\
40 - Oh, I think staying inside with no TV\\
41 - is worse than weeding.\\
42 - I'm already banned from TV.\\
43 - You are?\\
44 - All right. Fine.\\
45 - No TV, no going outside except for weeding,\\
46 - which you'll do at night.\\
47 - Inside.\\
48 - Oh, I got nothing.\\
49 - How long is this going to take?\\
50 - Oh, look, just... go to your room! Oh, you...\\
51 - Your father and I will sort this out.\\
52 - Okay.\\
53 - We are not getting through to him.\\
54 - Well, what else can we do?\\
55 - We-We've taken away television, video games,\\
56 - his music, fresh air.\\
57 - Lois, we have taken away his air,\\
58 - and he doesn't care about any of it.\\
59 - Well, we had better come up with something\\
60 - before he winds up being a problem for the state.\\
61 - I don't know, maybe we should try something\\
62 - other than punishing him.\\
63 - Like what?\\
64 - Maybe Reese needs more attention.\\
65 - Positive attention.\\
66 - When I was his age\\
67 - I always wanted someone there to talk to,\\
68 - to hang out with,\\
69 - be a role model.\\
70 - Oh, Hal, I don't know.\\
71 - Lois, that boy needs a father figure,\\
72 - and I really think it should be me.\\
73 - What is Cynthia doing?\\
74 - We thought you would know,\\
75 - given your relationship.\\
76 - We don't have a relationship.\\
77 - It's okay... to feel.\\
78 - Shut up.\\
79 - Hey, guys.\\
80 - Here you go.\\
81 - I'm having a party this weekend.\\
82 - Don't lose those invitations\\
83 - 'cause no one gets past my dad without them.\\
84 - A party.\\
85 - An actual, non-self-delusional- figment-of-my-imagination party.\\
86 - Is it your birthday?\\
87 - No, it's just for socializing.\\
88 - You know, it's weird.\\
89 - I've been here for a month and a half,\\
90 - and you guys are the only friends I have.\\
91 - You're kidding.\\
92 - I'm serious.\\
93 - It may be hard for you guys to believe,\\
94 - but some people have trouble\\
95 - making friends.\\
96 - Cynthia, are you sure you want to sound so...?\\
97 - Man, I wish I'd thought of this.\\
98 - I know!\\
99 - It's going to be so great.\\
100 - I'm finally going to make some friends.\\
101 - What do you think, Malcolm?\\
102 - It sounds great.\\
103 - It should be a...\\
104 - party.\\
105 - Fingers crossed.\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - All right.\\
108 - Hey, Eric, how's it going?\\
109 - You just missed your third history deadline, Francis.\\
110 - I am not going to Spangler's summer school\\
111 - because my partner blew off his half of the project.\\
112 - Didn't you get my half?\\
113 - I slipped it under your door.\\
114 - This  is your half?\\
115 - Yeah.\\
116 - This is my half!\\
117 - Well, if I knew you were going to go so overboard,\\
118 - I would have spent a little more time on my section.\\
119 - You photocopied a page out of the dictionary.\\
120 - Okay.\\
121 - I messed up.\\
122 - There's still time.\\
123 - When's this thing due, again?\\
124 - The 20th.\\
125 - And you're worried?\\
126 - We have over a week.\\
127 - My half took me two months.\\
128 - Okay, I guess I'm just going to have to buckle down\\
129 - and get it done, then.\\
130 - All right.\\
131 - I'll go to the library and get some books.\\
132 - You stay here and organize your notes.\\
133 - Sounds like a plan.\\
134 - 68 degrees.\\
135 - Perfect paper-writing temperature.\\
136 - Let's get to it.\\
137 - I thought you said we were trying something new.\\
138 - That's right, we are.\\
139 - So this isn't a punishment?\\
140 - No. Why would you say that?\\
141 - 'Cause you keep looking at me and saying stuff.\\
142 - I am paying attention to you.\\
143 - But, Dad, a cooking class?\\
144 - Come on, Reese, open your mind.\\
145 - The art of cooking is as masculine\\
146 - as any of these other courses--\\
147 - judo, riflery, kickboxing.\\
148 - Anyone can fight, but it takes a special man\\
149 - to craft a truly great Bolognese sauce.\\
150 - I still feel like I'm in trouble.\\
151 - Hi, I'm Cynthia.\\
152 - We don't know each other, but I'm having a party.\\
153 - See how it says, "8:00 till ?"\\
154 - That means it could go on ad infinitum.\\
155 - See you there.\\
156 - Hi, I'm Cynthia.\\
157 - We don't know each other, but...\\
158 - What is she doing, inviting the whole school?\\
159 - I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.\\
160 - I'm saving all my good conversation for the party.\\
161 - For instance, there's an interesting piece in this month's\\
162 - New England Journal of Medicine.\\
163 - Hey, that's  my  anecdote.\\
164 - I hope...\\
165 - my wheelchair... fits in the...\\
166 - make-out closet.\\
167 - I hope you come with an appetite.\\
168 - I'm serving cookies shaped like famous\\
169 - Communist revolutionaries.\\
170 - Hi, I'm Cynthia...\\
171 - Uh... Cynthia, can I talk to you for a second?\\
172 - Sure.\\
173 - Tell all your friends!\\
174 - How many people are you inviting to your party?\\
175 - God, who knows?\\
176 - I left a stack of invitations at the library\\
177 - and a stack at the arcade.\\
178 - I figure people will appreciate the personal touch.\\
179 - You know, so they can match a face with a face.\\
180 - Don't you think you're kind of overreaching?\\
181 - What are you talking about?\\
182 - I'm afraid you're setting yourself up\\
183 - for a giant disappointment.\\
184 - I mean, when ten people don't show up, it's a drag.\\
185 - When 300 people don't show up,\\
186 - it's, like, total humiliation.\\
187 - Well, I guess lots of people will have to show up, then.\\
188 - Cynthia, you're a Krelboyne.\\
189 - Krelboynes have Krelboyne parties.\\
190 - You don't know how many friends I'm capable of making.\\
191 - Yes, I do. Zero.\\
192 - Just like the rest of us.\\
193 - Cynthia, no one's coming to your party.\\
194 - Oh, yeah?\\
195 - Well, it so happens the Kinkos man said\\
196 - I set a new record for laminated invitations.\\
197 - So? That doesn't mean anything.\\
198 - I know what this is all about.\\
199 - You're jealous.\\
200 - Jealous?\\
201 - Making friends obviously doesn't come easy to you.\\
202 - So you hide in your safe little circle\\
203 - while people like me throw big parties\\
204 - and make lots of friends and enjoy life.\\
205 - Hmm? Bitter-- what a surprise.\\
206 - The key to quick chopping is to rest the blade\\
207 - against your knuckles and slowly pull back as we...\\
208 - Who chopped that?\\
209 - I-I did it.\\
210 - Let's see it again.\\
211 - Oh, my word!\\
212 - Actually, his slices are\\
213 - a little more uniform than yours.\\
214 - And you say you've never cooked anything before?\\
215 - Intentionally?\\
216 - No.\\
217 - Remarkable.\\
218 - Sit down and listen to me!\\
219 - I am sick of this!\\
220 - It's been two days\\
221 - and you haven't done a lick of work.\\
222 - And I can't believe I let you drag me to that movie.\\
223 - I know. I'm beginning to question\\
224 - the whole talking dog genre.\\
225 - You know what would get our mind off that movie?\\
226 - Another round of miniature golf!\\
227 - No! No miniature golf.\\
228 - You have to get to work.\\
229 - You're right.\\
230 - When you're right, you're right.\\
231 - Let's get to it.\\
232 - These two books are on the war itself\\
233 - so you can breeze through them\\
234 - 'cause your half of the project is on Reconstruction.\\
235 - Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about.\\
236 - But I will\\
237 - 'cause I'm not leaving this room\\
238 - for the next ten hours.\\
239 - That's what I like to hear.\\
240 - Now, before I go, do you need anything?\\
241 - I don't want you leaving this room.\\
242 - No, just stop bothering me.\\
243 - I'm trying to study.\\
244 - All right, Harvey, let's see if you can break Brent's record.\\
245 - You have to beat an hour and four minutes.\\
246 - Go!\\
247 - Sorry I'm late!\\
248 - Craig ran off some kids\\
249 - and needed me to walk him to his car.\\
250 - I'll have dinner ready in just one second.\\
251 - Shh, shh, shh.\\
252 - Look.\\
253 - Well?\\
254 - It's hot.\\
255 - And it needs another bay leaf.\\
256 - Just look at him.\\
257 - After tasting his chocolate souffl  ,\\
258 - the class actually gave him a standing ovation.\\
259 - Reese?\\
260 - Dewey,\\
261 - are you happy with how those are julienned?\\
262 - I think so.\\
263 - Go check the brioche.\\
264 - The bread in the oven?\\
265 - Ah.\\
266 - Dad, I just wanted to let you know\\
267 - how much that cooking class means to me.\\
268 - If you hadn't signed me up for it,\\
269 - I never would've known that something so stupid\\
270 - could be so much fun.\\
271 - Thanks.\\
272 - Oh, come on, that's got to make you feel good.\\
273 - Aw, look at Malcolm, surrounded by all his friends.\\
274 - I wonder what he owes his social success to?\\
275 - What do you think, Invisible Friend Number One?\\
276 - Leave me alone.\\
277 - There you go again-- pushing people away.\\
278 - You know, Malcolm, if you want to make friends\\
279 - you have to extend yourself.\\
280 - Yeah, you're right.\\
281 - I'm going to work on that. See ya.\\
282 - It's sad, really.\\
283 - I feel sorry for you.\\
284 - You know what?\\
285 - I just got the greatest idea!\\
286 - It's the perfect way to break you out\\
287 - of your self-protective shell.\\
288 - What are you talking about?\\
289 - You're going to cohost the party with me.\\
290 - Come on.\\
291 - Hi, I'm Cynthia and this is Malcolm.\\
292 - We're cohosting a party this weekend...\\
293 - Let go.\\
294 - And we have a musical invitation for you.\\
295 -     You should come 'round to our party, you'll have fun    \\
296 -     You'll have fun    \\
297 -     You should come 'round to our party, you'll have fun...    \\
298 - Okay, you made me do this.\\
299 - Can't you think of a better place to kiss me?\\
300 - There. Read that.\\
301 - Malcolm, are you crazy?\\
302 - Read.\\
303 - That's the Krelboyne Wall of Fame.\\
304 - You can see that you're pretty well represented.\\
305 - There's my section and there's Lloyd's.\\
306 - But in terms of sheer volume, you still have us beat.\\
307 - So do you understand now?\\
308 - You can't have that party.\\
309 - But that one there, that's ridiculous.\\
310 - No one really believes that about you.\\
311 - Real...\\
312 - classy.\\
313 - Hey, you guys seen Cynthia?\\
314 - No, but maybe you can settle a debate.\\
315 - Maroon or beige?\\
316 - What are you guys\\
317 - talking about?\\
318 - Duh. Matching turtlenecks for the party.\\
319 - Hey, everybody.\\
320 - Oh, Cynthia, I wanted to apologize...\\
321 - Nothing to apologize for, Malcolm.\\
322 - Here.\\
323 - I'm canceling my party.\\
324 - These are uninvitations.\\
325 - Don't crowd, there's one for each of you.\\
326 - Malcolm opened my eyes to the fact\\
327 - that I'm a creepy, friendless dork\\
328 - who has no reason to expect anyone\\
329 - to come to her party.\\
330 - You callous bastard!\\
331 - Cynthia, I didn't want to tell you like that. I'm sorry.\\
332 - No need to be sorry.\\
333 - I should be thanking you.\\
334 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
335 - Cynthia... You know what?!\\
336 - There's only so much crying\\
337 - I can do in one day,\\
338 - and just looking at you makes me want to cry.\\
339 - So, if you don't mind,\\
340 - I'd like to leave you now.\\
341 - All right, no more distractions, Francis.\\
342 - I'm tired of yelling at you.\\
343 - I'm not saying Harvey's last heat wasn't exciting...\\
344 - You didn't have to kill him, you know.\\
345 - Yes! Yes, I did.\\
346 - Now, please,\\
347 - as a friend, just focus!\\
348 - I'm sorry.\\
349 - I know I tend to procrastinate,\\
350 - but when a deadline nears, I always manage to get it done.\\
351 - Okay. I'll check on you in 30.\\
352 - Uh, you'd better take this.\\
353 - Why?\\
354 -     Man, you know this party's gettin' hotter    \\
355 -     It's gettin' hotter    \\
356 -     I'm feelin' hotter    \\
357 -     Feelin' hotter    \\
358 -     I want to let my hair down    \\
359 -     Gonna let my hair down.    \\
360 - I can't believe I really made this.\\
361 - You know, Dad,\\
362 - if you work really hard at something, it shows.\\
363 - Yes, son. Yes, it does.\\
364 - Mmm...\\
365 - Class, during our next session\\
366 - we'll be holding a little competition.\\
367 - Friends and relatives are encouraged to attend,\\
368 - and don't be discouraged if you feel a little outclassed\\
369 - by some of our more promising students.\\
370 - We're all here to have fun.\\
371 - What do I get if I win?\\
372 - A six-inch paring knife\\
373 - and a bread cloche.\\
374 - Awesome!\\
375 - May I help you?\\
376 - Hi. I'm Malcolm.\\
377 - I don't know if you remember...\\
378 - I'm not sure. I have a vague recollection\\
379 - of you throwing a brick through my daughter's window.\\
380 - Oh, and I think you're the kid\\
381 - who ruined her party and humiliated her in a public toilet.\\
382 - How am I doing?\\
383 - Now, if you don't mind...\\
384 - It's okay, Dad.\\
385 - How's it going?\\
386 - Oh, great.\\
387 - The party's a blast.\\
388 - Can't you hear it in there?\\
389 - What are you doing here, Malcolm?\\
390 - You won't talk to me at school\\
391 - and you won't return my calls.\\
392 - I just want to say again that I'm sorry.\\
393 - Fine.\\
394 - You want to alleviate your guilt?\\
395 - You are absolved.\\
396 - Just let me finish.\\
397 - I'm not sorry that I told you the truth.\\
398 - You were just setting yourself up\\
399 - for a big disaster tonight\\
400 - if you went ahead with your party.\\
401 - I just wish I was nicer about it.\\
402 - What's the nice way to tell someone\\
403 - they're a social retard?\\
404 - So you see my problem.\\
405 - But what I didn't say\\
406 - is that even if you are a dork,\\
407 - you're also smart and funny\\
408 - and interesting and kind\\
409 - and a totally unique person,\\
410 - and if other people can't see that,\\
411 - that's  their  problem.\\
412 - So, how'd you learn to deal with the whole school\\
413 - making fun of you?\\
414 - The same way I deal with everything:\\
415 - I pretend it doesn't bother me\\
416 - and then lash out on people\\
417 - who don't deserve it.\\
418 - It seems to work.\\
419 - Do you want to come in?\\
420 - Hey!\\
421 - Can I help you?\\
422 - Yeah. We're here for Cynthia's party.\\
423 - We found these things in the library.\\
424 - Uh...\\
425 - I thought you handed out uninvitations.\\
426 - I thought you said no one would come.\\
427 - Come on in... I guess.\\
428 - I think he's actually going to win.\\
429 - I just hope we get to taste whatever it is he's cooking.\\
430 - Reese, this is the best spinach quiche I've ever tasted.\\
431 - What gives it that extra something?\\
432 - I put some allspice on the pine nuts before I toasted them.\\
433 - Allspice. Yeah,\\
434 - it just seemed like it would balance out the ricotta.\\
435 - How extraordinary.\\
436 - How much salt did you use?\\
437 - Just a pinch.\\
438 - I did not put all of this salt in there.\\
439 - Where do you keep your first aid kit?\\
440 - My husband's tongue is swelling up like a melon.\\
441 - I need a bathroom!\\
442 - I guess Cynthia was right.\\
443 - If you invite people to a party, they'll show up.\\
444 -     Don't matter who's the best side    \\
445 -      East side, west side...     \\
446 - Well, that sounds like fun,\\
447 - but I think I'm going to leave it unpierced for a while.\\
448 - You girls should really\\
449 - get up to the planetarium.\\
450 - They got a great laser show up there.\\
451 - I have a card\\
452 - that can get four of you in\\
453 - for the price of three.\\
454 - Let me know when you're going.\\
455 - As soon as my grandmother falls asleep,\\
456 - I can sneak up and sit next to you.\\
457 - Are you wearing cologne?\\
458 - Just my... aftershave.\\
459 - Hey, Stevie.\\
460 - I'm working... here.\\
461 -     This party is jammin'    \\
462 -     Come on, get your booty on the floor...    \\
463 - Can we please just go?\\
464 - Yeah, just two more hours and then we'll head home.\\
465 - Francis, the project is due tomorrow.\\
466 - Okay, don't worry.\\
467 - We have an eight-hour ride home.\\
468 - We'll do it then.\\
469 - By the way, this is Terri and her friend Robin.\\
470 -     Everybody put your hands up...    \\
471 - Hi.\\
472 - I'm Eric.\\
473 - I'm totally going to summer school.\\
474 - Dewey, go to your room.\\
475 - But Reese\\
476 - is the one who poisoned all those people.\\
477 - Now!\\
478 - What is wrong with you guys?\\
479 - You didn't even let me accept my trophy.\\
480 - Oh, I'll give you a trophy, mister.\\
481 - Honey, the whole cooking thing was my idea.\\
482 - I'll handle this.\\
483 - Reese, we pulled you out of class\\
484 - because we know you cheated.\\
485 - Now, you would have won easily.\\
486 - Why did you do it?\\
487 - I don't know.\\
488 - It was fun.\\
489 - Those people worked very hard on their dishes,\\
490 - and you destroyed them.\\
491 - How would you feel\\
492 - if you were that poor woman whose quiche you salted?\\
493 - Fat?\\
494 - Reese...\\
495 - do you know what empathy is?\\
496 - No.\\
497 - Empathy is putting yourself into other people's shoes\\
498 - so you can feel the way they do.\\
499 - If you hurt someone, empathy makes you hurt as well.\\
500 - Then, why would you want empathy?\\
501 - He has no more sense of right and wrong than a tree frog.\\
502 - What are we going to do?\\
503 - What can we do?\\
504 - It's back to punishment.\\
505 - How can we punish him if he doesn't care about...?\\
506 - All right, son, here's what's going to happen.\\
507 - For the next month, you are not allowed to cook a meal.\\
508 - That's it?\\
509 - So I don't cook, big deal.\\
510 - That means no chicken cordon bleu, no Windsor tortes.\\
511 - Wait a second.\\
512 - You said no cooking.\\
513 - The torte is baking.\\
514 - No baking, no broiling, no saut  ing.\\
515 - Come on, you can't do that.\\
516 - You heard your father.\\
517 - The stove and all the whisks are off limits for a month.\\
518 - Oh, please, I'll be good. I promise.\\
519 - I'll do whatever you say.\\
520 - I'm sorry, son.\\
521 - This is the way it has to be.\\
522 - It worked.\\
523 - I think we really turned a corner with him.\\
524 - We have a weapon.\\
525 - His actions will have consequences.\\
526 - I know.\\
527 - We can hurt him.\\
528 - We can be parents again.\\
529 - Oh, it's even worth suffering through a month\\
530 - of eating your flank steaks.\\
531 - Amen to that.\\
532 -     Y'all gon' make me lose my mind    \\
533 -     Up in here, up in here...    \\
534 - You know, I just realized something.\\
535 - Parties suck.\\
536 - The music always stinks, the food's bad,\\
537 - and who cares if no one talks to you?\\
538 - People are such phonies anyway.\\
539 - Hey, Malcolm. Hey, Cynthia. Great party.\\
540 - I like the music, and what's in the dip?\\
541 - Ooh, you know what?\\
542 - I'm gonna need that chair.
\subsection {Episode 19: Tutoring Reese}
1 - Hal?\\
2 - Are you smoking again?\\
3 - No!\\
4 - I am cleaning.\\
5 - Do you smell smoke? No, but I...\\
6 - No, Lois, if I wanted to smoke a cigar\\
7 - I wouldn't be sneaking around\\
8 - like a scared little schoolboy.\\
9 - I would do it out in the open like a man.\\
10 - That was our third shop vac.\\
11 - That is our last shop vac.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Francis, I don't want to hear\\
25 - another argument about it.\\
26 - You are going to fix the roof.\\
27 - That is totally unfair!\\
28 - I come home from school and\\
29 - you immediately put me to work.\\
30 - Well, someone has to do it,\\
31 - and you know your father is terrified of heights.\\
32 - He is not terrified!\\
33 - The last time he changed a lightbulb,\\
34 - we had to talk him down from the table.\\
35 - You are going to do this.\\
36 - Why don't you just put a choke chain around my neck\\
37 - and make me sleep in the garage?!\\
38 - This is what we call a "level four" rage.\\
39 - The only way not to get nailed is to make no sudden moves\\
40 - and avoid eye contact at all costs.\\
41 - And  you...\\
42 - You think just because you hide the note,\\
43 - the parent-teacher meeting will just go away?\\
44 - Mom, Mr. Woodward is totally out to get me.\\
45 - Every teacher since kindergarten\\
46 - has been out to get you.\\
47 - I know. It upsets me, too.\\
48 - Why is the drain still clogged?\\
49 - Uh, honey, there was a, you know...\\
50 - I was only seconds away from...\\
51 - It's a funny thing, see...\\
52 - Oh, what a mess! Look at that!\\
53 - That is a milk ring on the table.\\
54 - Reese is still searching for academic truth.\\
55 - His...\\
56 - focus is diffuse.\\
57 - His initiative is waning, and...\\
58 - it's preventing his full potentiation.\\
59 - What?\\
60 - To put it simply, Reese isn't self-actualized.\\
61 - Look, maybe I could just give you a topic\\
62 - and you could tell us "good" or "bad."\\
63 - That would help us here.\\
64 - Reese is flunking almost every subject,\\
65 - and I'm going to recommend\\
66 - that he be moved into the remedial class.\\
67 - And that's a euphemism for...\\
68 - The remedial class.\\
69 - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
70 - No, no, that is not an option.\\
71 - We'll get him to buckle down.\\
72 - I hope it's that simple.\\
73 - Reese will get back on track.\\
74 - We'll see to it if it kills him.\\
75 - I'm glad to see your level of commitment.\\
76 - I'm really happy we had this chance to talk.\\
77 - So we can go now.\\
78 - I don't want to hear any excuses.\\
79 - You will sit down every night\\
80 - and work until those grades are up.\\
81 - Why do  I  have to tutor him?\\
82 - Because\\
83 - God gave you a giant brain.\\
84 - Blame him.\\
85 - Reese screws up, and I get punished for it?\\
86 - Where's the logic in that?\\
87 - Malcolm, I have zero tolerance on this one.\\
88 - Finally, Mom found the courage to speak her mind.\\
89 - Why aren't you fixing that roof?\\
90 - It's 40 degrees out there. I'll freeze.\\
91 - And it's going to rain.\\
92 - That's why you have to fix the roof.\\
93 - Well, maybe if you didn't buy such crappy shingles,\\
94 - it wouldn't leak all the time.\\
95 - Francis, as long as you are in this house,\\
96 - you will do as I say.\\
97 - You know what, Mom?\\
98 - No.\\
99 - I'm too old to be bullied by you.\\
100 - Our whole lives, you have done nothing\\
101 - but dictate what you wanted.\\
102 - You're the boss of the world,\\
103 - and we're all sick of it.\\
104 - This may be your roof, but we live here, too.\\
105 - We are human beings\\
106 - with rights, and I'm hereby putting an end\\
107 - to your reign of terror.\\
108 - You should have seen the look on her face.\\
109 - It was totally worth it.\\
110 - Sounds like you-you've had it rough.\\
111 - Oh, man, you have  no  idea.\\
112 - Thanks.\\
113 - I've got a place near the bus station.\\
114 - It's warm and fairly dry.\\
115 - You can stay there for a while.\\
116 - If-if you want to.\\
117 - You'd do that for me?\\
118 - It's a tough world.\\
119 - We've got to look out for each other.\\
120 - Thanks.\\
121 - Richie! Dude!\\
122 - I heard your mom kicked you out.\\
123 - You want to stay at my place?\\
124 - You are a  lifesaver!\\
125 - Could you give me a lift to...\\
126 - Sorry, man. We're going the other way.\\
127 - Hi.\\
128 - Why aren't you flying?\\
129 - My name is Dewey.\\
130 - Good to meet you, Tony.\\
131 - Want to play?\\
132 - Okay, but I get to be the red team.\\
133 - Look, I don't like this any better than you do.\\
134 - Let's just get it over with.\\
135 - Dude, this book's totally wrecked.\\
136 - What did you do to it?\\
137 - I threw it at a duck.\\
138 - Well, where's your math book?\\
139 - Which half?\\
140 - We'll just start with geography, then.\\
141 - I don't  take  geography!\\
142 - Yes, you do.\\
143 - You got a grade in it.\\
144 - Oh, that  can't  be good.\\
145 - Mi casa es su casa.\\
146 - This may be my parents' house,\\
147 - but, dude...\\
148 - down here, anything goes.\\
149 - Oh! What is that smell?\\
150 - It could be the laundry.\\
151 - It could be the mildew.\\
152 - It could be that rat I shot.\\
153 - I think I wounded it.\\
154 - It probably crawled into a hole in the wall\\
155 - to die or something.\\
156 - What's this?\\
157 - It's your bed. You got to blow it up.\\
158 - Welcome to Chez Richie.\\
159 - Rule number one: there are no rules.\\
160 - Rule number two: no shoes on the sofa.\\
161 - It is  so  real.\\
162 - Come on. What's the answer?\\
163 - You can do this.\\
164 - We've gone over this a thousand times.\\
165 - You have to carry the tenths.\\
166 - Tenths have to go someplace.\\
167 - Tenths don't just float around.\\
168 - Get smarter already!\\
169 - Think. Make your brain work.\\
170 - I could be outside doing anything other than this.\\
171 - But, no. I'm stuck in here babysitting this...\\
172 - 4.2.\\
173 - That's right.\\
174 - I mean...\\
175 - I actually understand this.\\
176 - The tenths have to go someplace.\\
177 - Great. Let's move on to the next one.\\
178 - Hal! Come down from there!\\
179 - Hi, honey.\\
180 - What do you think you're doing?\\
181 - Oh, just... fixing the shingles.\\
182 - Francis has responsibilities.\\
183 - You can't keep covering for him.\\
184 - This is not about him.\\
185 - It's about me.\\
186 - I just wanted to get some fresh air and...\\
187 - the view from up here is...\\
188 - is incredible.\\
189 - Did you ever think that I might be enjoying myself?\\
190 - I spent two days on it.\\
191 - There was even a paragraph that I thought really sucked\\
192 - so I went back and rewrote it.\\
193 - Malcolm, I'd never done that before,\\
194 - but last night... I mean, look at me.\\
195 - I'm going on and on while you're sitting here trying to read.\\
196 - How's the grammar?\\
197 - Never mind.\\
198 - Reese...\\
199 - This is C-minus work.\\
200 - All right! Nice job!\\
201 - You're not just saying that?\\
202 - No. This is seriously the best work I've ever seen you do.\\
203 - Yes! That's great!\\
204 - I couldn't have done it without you!\\
205 - Thanks, Malcolm.\\
206 - Ew!\\
207 - I kicked your ass!\\
208 - You got another "F"!\\
209 - Mom, I read that paper.\\
210 - It's not an "F"! Then what is this?\\
211 - We've been studying four hours a night.\\
212 - Well, guess what. It's not enough.\\
213 - You're going to study eight hours a night\\
214 - if that's what it takes to get your grades up,\\
215 - and that's what you're going to do. But, Mom...\\
216 - I don't see a mother here.\\
217 - All I see is a warden with two prisoners\\
218 - who are out of their cell.\\
219 - Now get back in there!\\
220 - Oh, oh, oh!\\
221 - Not like this.\\
222 - I'm okay! I'm okay!\\
223 - Okay, you know what?\\
224 - It's freezing, but I don't need heat\\
225 - 'cause I got justice on my side.\\
226 - Mom will cave.\\
227 - She'll cave.\\
228 - It's going to be so sweet.\\
229 - Could you do that in the bathroom, Richie?\\
230 - Dude, no one's going in there for at least six hours.\\
231 - Well, then, could you do it over a wastebasket or something?\\
232 - And can we cool it on the porno for, like, five minutes?\\
233 - Yeah. When this is over, I'll just pop in\\
234 - Sluts of the Big Ten.\\
235 - No. No more porn.\\
236 - Dude...\\
237 - that's a documentary.\\
238 - Ow!\\
239 - God, my eye!\\
240 - Hey, try to find that toenail, Francis.\\
241 - It is so creepy to step on those things.\\
242 - Ow!\\
243 - Come on, Reese, the test is in two hours!\\
244 - This is too much, Malcolm.\\
245 - I'll never pass this thing.\\
246 - There's 30 true-false questions and five essays.\\
247 - It's impossible.\\
248 - So, Reese, today's the big test?\\
249 - What do you have to get on this thing\\
250 - to say out of remedial class?\\
251 - A "B."\\
252 - No, guys, he's serious.\\
253 - But you're... an idiot.\\
254 - You're right.\\
255 - Yeah. The only way this idiot's going to pass the test\\
256 - is if somebody else takes it for the idiot.\\
257 - Right, idiot?\\
258 - Stevie set the precedent!\\
259 - You had a chance for rebuttal,\\
260 - but since you didn't answer\\
261 - you waived your right!\\
262 - Therefore, it's an agreed-upon term!\\
263 - What am I going to do?\\
264 - I can't get put in the remedial class.\\
265 - They walk to the cafeteria\\
266 - holding each other's belts.\\
267 - Unless...\\
268 - maybe Lloyd's right.\\
269 - Maybe someone should take the test for you.\\
270 - You mean cheat?\\
271 - We can't cheat.\\
272 - Mom will kill us.\\
273 - And it's wrong.\\
274 - But more importantly, Mom would kill us!\\
275 - Hey, we're out of options here, Reese.\\
276 - You're going to get caught. No, we're not.\\
277 - And you know why?\\
278 - Because we have four brilliant minds here\\
279 - to help plan this out.\\
280 - You had to appeal to my vanity, didn't you?\\
281 - I'm in.\\
282 - I'm sorry, but I am honor-bound\\
283 - to report this conversation to the vice-principal.\\
284 - Then we're honor-bound to report\\
285 - you still sleep with an Elmo blankie.\\
286 - Okay, I'm in.\\
287 - We, uh... here's the VCR you ordered.\\
288 - I didn't order a VCR.\\
289 - Yes, you did!\\
290 - Feel free to call and verify.\\
291 - I know the extension number.\\
292 - There's someone there right now.\\
293 - That won't be...\\
294 - Or you can take a look\\
295 - at this A/V equipment schedule.\\
296 - Your name and class hour's right here on page seven\\
297 - in nonstudent handwriting.\\
298 - All right.\\
299 - Go ahead and leave it.\\
300 - Okay.\\
301 - No, no, you said you didn't order a cart\\
302 - so you're not going to get one.\\
303 - We'll just be leaving and pushing this out the door.\\
304 - Ah, here it is!\\
305 - Hey, watch out!\\
306 - Be... the cannonball.\\
307 - Are you all right?\\
308 - Way to go... hot rod!\\
309 - Okay, well, there's the rat.\\
310 - No, Tony, that's not fair.\\
311 - Today it's my cartoons before school\\
312 - and your cartoons  after  school.\\
313 - Fine, Tony, be that way.\\
314 - I don't want to be your friend anyway.\\
315 - Tony!\\
316 - I can't stay mad at you either.\\
317 - Hey...\\
318 - Did you get that history test back yet?\\
319 - Not yet. No, haven't seen it.\\
320 - You both better pray for a "B."\\
321 - Hey, did Francis call you at work yet?\\
322 - No. No, I haven't talked to him since he...\\
323 - He thinks he's making some kind of point\\
324 - by cutting off all contact.\\
325 - You know, he should know.\\
326 - Till he's ready to apologize,\\
327 - there's really no reason to call.\\
328 - I can't wait to see the look on his face\\
329 - when he realizes that we have figured him out.\\
330 - Ah! What have we to figure out, dear?\\
331 - That I'm in it for the long haul.\\
332 - He should know\\
333 - I am prepared to go the distance!\\
334 - You know, I think he likes tomatoes on his sandwich.\\
335 - Other bag, Hal.\\
336 - Ah, right. Bye.\\
337 - Bye.\\
338 - A masterful "B,"\\
339 - Malcolm.\\
340 - I could never dumb myself down like this.\\
341 - I find this "F"\\
342 - very troubling.\\
343 - Something... stinks.\\
344 - He knows we cheated!\\
345 - We're going to have to start cutting separate deals.\\
346 - He doesn't know anything, Dabney.\\
347 - I'm gonna go talk to him.\\
348 - Mr. Woodward?\\
349 - I'm Malcolm, I'm Reese's brother.\\
350 - Oh, hi, how are you?\\
351 - Well, Reese is upset.\\
352 - He thinks he did better than an "F"\\
353 - on his history test.\\
354 - I read it over, and I sort of thought...\\
355 - it wasn't half bad.\\
356 - Do you think there's any way\\
357 - you can maybe take another look?\\
358 - Malcolm, you should be commended for your fraternity,\\
359 - but, uh, the test deserved an "F."\\
360 - Mr. Woodward, maybe if you just looked at it again...\\
361 - I can't spend a disproportionate amount of time on Reese.\\
362 - It's not fair to the other students.\\
363 - But he didn't deserve an "F" on this.\\
364 - Look, Malcolm, I-I've been a teacher for a long time\\
365 - and, uh, I think I know what Reese is capable of.\\
366 - I really don't think you do, because...\\
367 - Look, you may not want to hear this about your brother,\\
368 - but I've known kids like Reese my whole life.\\
369 - They're the ones\\
370 - who throw water at you\\
371 - so it looks like you wet your pants.\\
372 - They aim for your legs\\
373 - in dodgeball,\\
374 - and you fall down and you break your jaw\\
375 - and you need to have your mouth wired shut\\
376 - and your teeth don't set properly.\\
377 - And you spend six years in orthodontia\\
378 - with the most painfully embarrassing headgear\\
379 - ever designed,\\
380 - which is only because they don't feel fully actualized.\\
381 - That guy's totally out to get you.\\
382 - Man! I was just using that as an excuse.\\
383 - He is so dead when Mom finds out!\\
384 - Reese, we can't bust him.\\
385 - If we rat him out, then Mom will know\\
386 - we cheated.\\
387 - We're doomed.\\
388 - Two is after one.\\
389 - Three is after two.\\
390 - Four is after three.\\
391 - Something is after something\\
392 - and then we get to ten!\\
393 - Good lord! FRANCIS: Thank God you're here!\\
394 - I was afraid you weren't going to get my message at work.\\
395 - What happened to your eye...?\\
396 - Hey, how do you guys want your burgers?\\
397 - Just a sec, man.\\
398 - All right, so I got it all worked out.\\
399 - You tell Mom that you need me to repair the lawnmower,\\
400 - and then I hang out and I just...\\
401 - No, no, I-I'm just not going to do that, Francis.\\
402 - Hey, you guys better\\
403 - figure it out quick.\\
404 - This cheap-ass trash can's melting.\\
405 - Well, maybe you could talk to her then?\\
406 - Just calm her down so that I could come home, maybe today even?\\
407 - Francis, you've got to stop putting me in the middle!\\
408 - What, you're just going to let her win this round, too?!\\
409 - Francis, there is nothing that I can do.\\
410 - You know what the problem is here?\\
411 - You and your mother are exactly alike!\\
412 - That's a lie!\\
413 - That is  true!\\
414 - You're both stubborn and unwilling to bend.\\
415 - So, fine, you win!\\
416 - Congratulations!\\
417 - This is your prize!\\
418 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go.\\
419 - It smells like something died in here.\\
420 - Your father's right, man.\\
421 - Sometimes you can be so stupid.\\
422 - Uh-oh.\\
423 - I'm sorry.\\
424 - No one wanted it to turn out this way.\\
425 - I feel like I let Reese down.\\
426 - Just keep moving, Tony.\\
427 - So where does this leave us?\\
428 - I think it's best if we make the switch as soon as possible.\\
429 - We need to look at this\\
430 - as an opportunity.\\
431 - Big opportunity, being in the dumb class.\\
432 - Reese, this isn't what I wanted,\\
433 - but you haven't left us any choice.\\
434 - Mom, don't do this.\\
435 - It's not Reese's fault.\\
436 - He didn't deserve an "F" on that test.\\
437 - Malcolm, we've already had this discussion.\\
438 - I saw the test, he did a good job.\\
439 - He deserved a "B."\\
440 - This guy is totally out to get him.\\
441 - Malcolm...\\
442 - Look, I'm sorry you feel that way,\\
443 - but you can't blame me for Reese's shortcomings.\\
444 - Mom, this is the test.\\
445 - Take a look at this question.\\
446 - "What was the cause of the Great Depression?"\\
447 - He put down "Black Thursday."\\
448 - That's a correct answer.\\
449 - No, that's only a partial answer.\\
450 - To get full credit he should have included\\
451 - the vast overproduction in the U.S.,\\
452 - protectionism in the foreign markets....\\
453 - Overexpansion of credit\\
454 - and stock market speculation?\\
455 - Yes. That would have been\\
456 - a complete answer.\\
457 - Ha! You didn't read the answer\\
458 - because that's exactly what I wrote.\\
459 - "I" wrote?\\
460 - The royal "I," as in Reese.\\
461 - Because I think we can all identify\\
462 - with what he's going through.\\
463 - You took that test, didn't you?\\
464 - You cheated...\\
465 - You let him cheat for you?\\
466 - You gave something he wrote an "F"?!\\
467 - You  are  out to get him.\\
468 - Oh, I can't wait to see you expelled or disbarred\\
469 - or whatever it is they do\\
470 - to creepy little men who abuse their power.\\
471 - There is no need for name-calling.\\
472 - I suggest we just leave things as they are...\\
473 - Oh, I don't think so.\\
474 - Here's the situation:\\
475 - if you notify the school,\\
476 - then the school will find out Malcolm cheated.\\
477 - He'll be expelled.\\
478 - Don't you threaten me.\\
479 - This isn't a threat.\\
480 - I just don't think you'd throw away\\
481 - the son who achieves for...\\
482 - well, Reese.\\
483 - You don't think I'd sacrifice this one?\\
484 - Let me explain something to you.\\
485 - I would sell Malcolm down the river\\
486 - in a heartbeat to save Reese.\\
487 - What? Malcolm's gonna be fine\\
488 - no matter what happens.\\
489 - Maybe he'll have to go\\
490 - to junior college or start off blue collar,\\
491 - but he'll work his way up to management eventually.\\
492 - Reese is the one who needs saving.\\
493 - I don't believe you.\\
494 - No mother could ever be that callous to her own son.\\
495 - Mom, please let me come home!\\
496 - I'm cold and I'm hungry!\\
497 - Please, I'll fix the roof!\\
498 - I'll paint the house, I'll do anything, Mom!\\
499 - Please, just let me live indoors, Mom!\\
500 - Please, I want to be warm again!\\
501 - Mom, please!\\
502 - Maybe we can work something out.\\
503 - There you go, Tony.\\
504 - Night-night.\\
505 - Oh, my God, look at the size of that thing.\\
506 - Dewey, what in the...?\\
507 - Run, Tony, Run!\\
508 - Why are they always named Tony?\\
509 - Bye, Tony.\\
510 - I love you.\\
511 - Yeah, it's cold, filthy and dangerous,\\
512 - but I say we got off easy.\\
513 - If we all pitch in, we should be done in a week.\\
514 - Hey, hurry up.\\
515 - I'm trying.\\
516 - I've got tar in my eyes.
\subsection {Episode 20: Bowling}
1 - This sucks.\\
2 - I know.\\
3 - I wish we were old enough to drive.\\
4 - Then we'd never be bored.\\
5 - I wish I could get out on my own\\
6 - and make a bunch of money and start the party.\\
7 - I wish I was a bird.\\
8 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
9 -     I don't know    \\
10 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     Life is unfair.    \\
20 - We're going bowling tonight with some kids from school.\\
21 - It's, like, four boys and six, you know, girls.\\
22 - Not that I care.\\
23 - Doesn't make any difference to me.\\
24 - Why can't I go bowling, too?\\
25 - Because you are spending the night in your room.\\
26 - You are being punished.\\
27 - And tomorrow you are going to the store\\
28 - and buying Mrs. McNabb a new parakeet!\\
29 - Aw, Dad? Don't look at me.\\
30 - As far as you boys are concerned,\\
31 - your mom and I are a united front.\\
32 - We're ready. Who's going to drive us?\\
33 - I'll do it. I'll do it.\\
34 - You, to your room. March!\\
35 - Come on, son.\\
36 - Race you to your room.\\
37 - Oh, boys, you are going to have so much fun.\\
38 - One complaint about your behavior\\
39 - and I'll come down on you like a hammer.\\
40 - Bowling strikes, picking up spares...\\
41 - And when you're getting ready to roll,\\
42 - the girls will be in back of you,\\
43 - checking out the old hinder.\\
44 - This is one of the last places\\
45 - you haven't been banned from,\\
46 - so unless you want to spend your Saturday nights\\
47 - in the Laundromat, you'd better behave.\\
48 - Do I smell cologne?\\
49 - Very sophisticated.\\
50 - Is this Irving Street?\\
51 - I've never seen that church before.\\
52 - Let's see, we were supposed to take the second left\\
53 - after we went over the bridge, and then...\\
54 - Oh, geez, how's anybody supposed to find this place?\\
55 - Here we are.\\
56 - This is good, Mom.\\
57 - You can drop us off here.\\
58 - Yeah, you don't need to come in.\\
59 - We can walk the rest of the way.\\
60 - Oh, I understand.\\
61 - You're at that age where I'm an embarrassment to you.\\
62 - Hi. I need two pair of shoes--\\
63 - size seven and size nine.\\
64 - Coming up.\\
65 - Where did all my money go?\\
66 - I've only got six dollars?\\
67 - Uh... just give me one pair, size eight.\\
68 - You boys can share.\\
69 - But Reese isn't wearing any socks.\\
70 - I'm not sticking my socks in those nasty shoes.\\
71 - Ha-ha! See?\\
72 - Told you we'd find it.\\
73 - Now let's just get you set up with some shoes.\\
74 - Ooh! Pricey.\\
75 - Good thing I stole some cash\\
76 - from your mom's wallet this morning.\\
77 - Go to sleep.\\
78 - I don't want to hear another peep out of you.\\
79 - It's not fair.\\
80 - I don't want to go to sleep early.\\
81 - Fine. Feel free to lie awake all night.\\
82 - Okay, go to sleep.\\
83 - I don't want to hear a peep out of you.\\
84 - It's not fair.\\
85 - I don't want to go to sleep early.\\
86 - We're not debating this.\\
87 - I'm serious, Dewey.\\
88 - I don't want any trouble with you.\\
89 - That means no pleading, no whining, no crying.\\
90 - You do understand why we're doing this, don't you, son?\\
91 - Hey, check it out.\\
92 - Beth Ballard's here.\\
93 - Yeah.\\
94 - I hear she's why Mr. Thomas got fired.\\
95 - You can go now.\\
96 - Thanks for the ride.\\
97 - Where are the parents?\\
98 - Are there no parents here?\\
99 - Mom, please don't...\\
100 - Where are your parents?\\
101 - Who's chaperoning this?\\
102 - Mom, we don't need a chaperone.\\
103 - Okay, it's me.\\
104 - We got two lanes here-- let's use them!\\
105 - You, you, you, you and you, you'll use that lane.\\
106 - You five use this one.\\
107 - Mom, please don't do this.\\
108 - Are you kidding?\\
109 - You guys are bowling.\\
110 - You could cut the hormones around here with a knife.\\
111 - I mean, what kind of parent\\
112 - would leave these kids alone with themselves?\\
113 - Okay, I'll see you in a couple hours.\\
114 - Hey, there's\\
115 - Beth Ballard.\\
116 - Did you see that? She smiled at me.\\
117 - Hate to break it to you, but she was smiling at me.\\
118 - Okay, fine.\\
119 - Let's both go talk to her and find out.\\
120 - Sounds fair.\\
121 - Hey, Beth.\\
122 - Hi, Reese.\\
123 - Having fun?\\
124 - I guess.\\
125 - I'm kind of surprised to see you here.\\
126 - I mean, you're too cool\\
127 - to have to go to a bowling party.\\
128 - Well, I could say the same thing about you.\\
129 - Hey, I've got a great joke.\\
130 - How would you like to take a walk on the beach,\\
131 - feel the salt spray in your face and the wind in your hair?\\
132 - Sure. I guess.\\
133 - Looks like you already have!\\
134 - What's the matter with you?\\
135 - You spit on me, you pig!\\
136 - What? Don't you get it?\\
137 - Yeah, just one game.\\
138 - Oh, can you put me down at the end?\\
139 - See, my kids are here with a bunch of friends,\\
140 - and, you know, some are girls.\\
141 - I don't want to cramp their style.\\
142 - That's just not me.\\
143 - And another thing--\\
144 - the next person who swears\\
145 - is getting their parents called.\\
146 - You can count on it.\\
147 - I want to see a little daylight between you two.\\
148 - Let's go, Malcolm. You can do it.\\
149 - You're not going to throw\\
150 - another gutter ball this time.\\
151 - Mom, just let me bowl.\\
152 - Okay, okay.\\
153 - That's a good effort, Malcolm.\\
154 - Yes!\\
155 - Nice roll.\\
156 - Thanks.\\
157 - And you're pretty good, too.\\
158 - I've got a joke for you.\\
159 - Would you like to take a walk on the beach...\\
160 - Reese!\\
161 - You're up!\\
162 - Oh.\\
163 - Hello.\\
164 - Hey, Dad. I need a favor.\\
165 - Let's hear it.\\
166 - Well, some of the other cadets\\
167 - are going in together on an old car,\\
168 - and if I put in $100\\
169 - I get the car every seventh weekend.\\
170 - I could take road trips\\
171 - and go on dates.\\
172 - I could drive underprivileged children to cultural stuff.\\
173 - Oh, come on, Francis.\\
174 - That's ridiculous.\\
175 - I'm not giving you the money\\
176 - to buy one-seventh of a piece of junk.\\
177 - Okay. Just thought I'd ask.\\
178 - Later, Dad. Bye.\\
179 - Hey, Mom, I need a favor.\\
180 - Sure. Let's hear it.\\
181 - Well, some of the other cadets\\
182 - are going in together on an old car\\
183 - and if I put in 100 bucks\\
184 - I get the car every seventh weekend.\\
185 - Get back in there!\\
186 - I could take road trips and go on dates.\\
187 - I could drive underprivileged children to cultural stuff.\\
188 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry.\\
189 - I really don't think we can afford this right now.\\
190 - Of course. I knew you'd say that.\\
191 - Why do I even try?\\
192 - Now you can go to bed happy,\\
193 - knowing that you kept my life a living hell!\\
194 - Maybe the lane is warped.\\
195 - Mom, please.\\
196 - You're not that bad of a bowler, Malcolm.\\
197 - I know you're not.\\
198 - What are you doing? Try this one.\\
199 - It's a lighter ball.\\
200 - Mom, this is a little kid's ball.\\
201 - Just do it. Try it.\\
202 - Pick a lane!\\
203 - Your brother's not very good.\\
204 - Maybe you should help him.\\
205 - Nah. I couldn't do that in front of everybody.\\
206 - I'm kind of his hero.\\
207 - It would just embarrass him.\\
208 - That's sweet.\\
209 - You know, you never\\
210 - told me that joke. Oh, right.\\
211 - Would you like to take a walk on the beach,\\
212 - feel the salt spray...\\
213 - Reese, you're up!\\
214 - Yeah!\\
215 - Pop 'em and drop 'em.\\
216 - I'm not buying it.\\
217 - What's wrong, son?\\
218 - Nothing.\\
219 - Oh. Hey, you want me to read you a story?\\
220 - No.\\
221 - Oh, come on.\\
222 - Hey, I'll read you "Wilbur the Worried Worm."\\
223 - You love that.\\
224 - Let's see, where...\\
225 - Hey, here it is.\\
226 - How about that?\\
227 - Okay.\\
228 - "There once was a worried little worm named Wilbur."\\
229 - Oh, perfect.\\
230 - "Wilbur lived in a magic garden filled with beautiful flowers.\\
231 - One day..."\\
232 - Ha-cha!\\
233 - Man, six strikes.\\
234 - You're on your way to a perfect...\\
235 - Hey.\\
236 - Oh, hi.\\
237 - Sorry about my brother.\\
238 - We try to limit his contact with humans.\\
239 - Don't worry. You still look great.\\
240 - You're not very much like him, are you?\\
241 - No.\\
242 - You're so cute.\\
243 - I hate bowling. I love bowling.\\
244 - Medium with thick crust,\\
245 - mushroom, pepperoni... and extra cheese, please.\\
246 - Ah.\\
247 - Gesundheit.\\
248 - I am the mayor of Strike Town. Yah!\\
249 - Are you deaf?\\
250 - What?\\
251 - I guess that's a yes\\
252 - to the "do you like my lip gloss?" question.\\
253 - Yeah. Uh, yes.\\
254 - I mean, why wouldn't I say yes to anything you ask?\\
255 - Hey, not bad.\\
256 - You're a pretty smooth talker.\\
257 - What else are you good at?\\
258 - A lot of things.\\
259 - So, how about you pick... one thing?\\
260 - Maybe I will.\\
261 - Maybe I'd like that.\\
262 - Maybe you would.\\
263 - My roll.\\
264 - Maybe it is.\\
265 - I just can't seem to stop talking like this.\\
266 - Stop talking like that, Malcolm.\\
267 - You can do this-- now, just remember,\\
268 - bend your knee on the follow-through.\\
269 - And remember to keep\\
270 - your elbow in.\\
271 - Why don't you just kill me and get it over with?\\
272 - Come on, I'm trying to help you.\\
273 - Can't I at least use a boy's ball?\\
274 - No. You've knocked over five pins\\
275 - since you switched to that ball.\\
276 - Aw...\\
277 - You must really want out of this room\\
278 - to draw such a manipulative picture.\\
279 - Mm-hmm.\\
280 - Go to sleep, sweetie.\\
281 - That's $11.50.\\
282 - I gave all my cash to the video guy.\\
283 - Do you take credit cards?\\
284 - Yeah.\\
285 - Is one enough?\\
286 - Better make that two.\\
287 - Thank you.\\
288 - Gesundheit.\\
289 - Oh, oh, wait. Where are you going?\\
290 - I have to use the restroom. No, no, no.\\
291 - Nobody leaves. But I...\\
292 - No, no, no, please, please,\\
293 - everything's got to stay the same.\\
294 - Please, I need you here.\\
295 - I've never... I've never been this close before.\\
296 - You are a part of this.\\
297 - You're all\\
298 - a part of this.\\
299 - Each a thread in a fabric of the perfect game.\\
300 - Oh, sure, it'll be my name\\
301 - up there on that plaque by the men's room door,\\
302 - but each of you know in your heart\\
303 - that you had a vital role Okay, okay.\\
304 - in my success... Okay.\\
305 - Okay!\\
306 - Just... go quick.\\
307 - Okay, thank you.\\
308 - Thank you.\\
309 - Gesundheit.\\
310 - Two to go.\\
311 - What's their problem?\\
312 - Yeah. It's just bowling.\\
313 - Relax.\\
314 - I wish we could be alone somewhere.\\
315 - Like outside?\\
316 - No. There's security cameras out there.\\
317 - Trust me.\\
318 - You see, Malcolm?\\
319 - Isn't it great when you don't have\\
320 - to worry about the gutters?\\
321 - You can just bowl and have fun.\\
322 - I wish we could be alone somewhere.\\
323 - Me, too.\\
324 - Wait, I still have to tell you that joke.\\
325 - Would you like to take a walk on the beach,\\
326 - feel the salt...\\
327 - You know what?\\
328 - That's not a good joke.\\
329 - Mom, I don't want to do this.\\
330 - Malcolm, I didn't raise you\\
331 - to stop trying when something is hard.\\
332 - You can do this.\\
333 - You just concentrate on those pins.\\
334 - You throw the ball.\\
335 - You are not giving up until you bowl a strike.\\
336 - Your mother's right, Connie.\\
337 - My name's not Connie!\\
338 - Okay, Mom,\\
339 - you want to see a strike?!\\
340 - Malcolm, what are you doing?\\
341 - Look at me!\\
342 - I'm the world's greatest bowler!\\
343 - I care so much about bowling!\\
344 - Bowling is so important!\\
345 - Malcolm, come back here!\\
346 - You want a strike?\\
347 - I'll give you a strike!\\
348 - Here's your damn strike!\\
349 - Way to go, Connie!\\
350 - Listen, maybe you shouldn't...\\
351 - Connie, Connie.\\
352 - Connie, Connie, Connie.\\
353 - Connie, Connie, Connie...\\
354 - Oh, man, that was classic.\\
355 - Okay, let's go make out.\\
356 - I don't think so.\\
357 - ...Connie, Connie, Connie,\\
358 - Connie, Connie...\\
359 - Okay, I think bowling's over.\\
360 - Get your jackets.\\
361 - I'm taking everyone home.\\
362 - Turn in the shoes.\\
363 - I'll meet you out front.\\
364 - See? Nobody's here.\\
365 - Yeah.\\
366 - You know, I think you're really cute.\\
367 - Thanks.\\
368 - You're cute, too.\\
369 - Only one more.\\
370 - Okay, I'm going for it.\\
371 - I'm totally going to kiss her.\\
372 - Gesundheit.\\
373 - That counts, right?\\
374 - 300.\\
375 - It has to count.\\
376 - 3-0-0.\\
377 - 3-0-0.\\
378 - 3-0... oh!\\
379 - What's going on?\\
380 - I haven't heard a peep out of you in over an hour.\\
381 - I'm kind of tired.\\
382 - But you haven't tried your fake running away\\
383 - or your sleepwalking yet.\\
384 - It's not like you to give up so easily.\\
385 - Hmm.\\
386 - Maybe you've finally learned\\
387 - that all those silly little games you play\\
388 - aren't going to get you anywhere.\\
389 - I guess.\\
390 - When you're punished in this house\\
391 - you're going to serve your time.\\
392 - There's no getting around it.\\
393 - Well, I suppose you've suffered enough.\\
394 - I guess there's no harm in 20 minutes of television.\\
395 - Okay.\\
396 - Wait a minute.\\
397 - Unless this is a new ploy.\\
398 - You get right back into bed, mister.\\
399 - Okay.\\
400 - No, no, hold on.\\
401 - I'm-I'm... I'm being ridiculous.\\
402 - Go, watch TV.\\
403 - Wait, not so fast.\\
404 - I'm not falling for it.\\
405 - I'm being ridiculous.\\
406 - But you are not getting away with it.\\
407 - Go, watch TV.\\
408 - No, stop, stop.\\
409 - Stay right where you are.\\
410 - Okay.\\
411 - Okay, I tell you what we're going to do.\\
412 - You are-are going to watch television.\\
413 - But it's going to be something you're not going to enjoy.\\
414 - That ought to do it.\\
415 - Okay, who just won?\\
416 - I'm not sure.\\
417 - Hey, Mom, I've got to tell you--\\
418 - I wasn't on board at first with you staying,\\
419 - but tonight was...\\
420 - well, it was magic.\\
421 - Hi.\\
422 - What? You want to make fun of me, too?\\
423 - No.\\
424 - I just wanted to tell you\\
425 - that I thought it was really brave of you\\
426 - to stand up to your mom like that.\\
427 - And I also thought\\
428 - it was hilarious\\
429 - the way you didn't hit a single pin\\
430 - when you were, like, what, an inch away?\\
431 - Is there a point to all this?\\
432 - No.\\
433 - Do you want to kiss me?\\
434 - Why do you think you can come over here\\
435 - and make fun of me and...\\
436 - Okay, that's it.\\
437 - Oh, for God's sake,\\
438 - you are worse than your father.\\
439 - You two are sitting on opposite sides of the car.\\
440 - Okay, fine, don't count it.\\
441 - But you and I both know\\
442 - that was a perfect game.\\
443 - Reese, get out of the photo booth!\\
444 - Uh, hi.\\
445 - You... you probably want your privacy.\\
446 - I'll get out of your way.\\
447 - So, how'd it go? So, how'd it go?\\
448 - Next time, you take 'em. Next time, you take 'em.
\subsection {Episode 21: Malcolm vs Reese}
1 - Hey, Mom.\\
2 - Want to buy a worm?\\
3 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
4 - Well, let's get you cleaned up.\\
5 - Don't forget your ears, Dewey!\\
6 - Okay!\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Hey, you!\\
20 - When Francis is home, anything we do is fun.\\
21 - I mean, we're just watching\\
22 - some stupid TV show, but it doesn't matter.\\
23 - This totally rules.\\
24 - This totally sucks!\\
25 - Isn't there anything fun to do around here?\\
26 - I've got some chalk.\\
27 - We could draw some dead guy outlines on the sidewalk.\\
28 - Boring.\\
29 - Mom's not home.\\
30 - We could play cantaloupe ball.\\
31 - We did that last time I was home.\\
32 - Come on, guys, think!\\
33 - I'd be up for the chalk outline thing.\\
34 - Kitty's at the end of an ear infection.\\
35 - He'll need drops three times a day.\\
36 - Now, Jellybean likes to have\\
37 - a half-cup of wet food in one bowl\\
38 - and a half-cup of dry in another.\\
39 - Now, he likes the juice\\
40 - from the wet half poured onto the dry.\\
41 - Now, no overfeeding.\\
42 - I mean that, mister.\\
43 - Okay, maybe tomorrow.\\
44 - I can't say no to you.\\
45 - Craig, can we speed things up?\\
46 - We've got Jellybean's emergency numbers.\\
47 - We know where his sweaters are.\\
48 - You showed us how to take his temperature.\\
49 - Is there anything else Dewey needs to know?\\
50 - I guess that's it, sport.\\
51 - Now, taking care of another living thing\\
52 - is a big responsibility.\\
53 - Are you sure you're up to the challenge?\\
54 - Mm-hmm.\\
55 - Don't worry, Craig. I have a feeling\\
56 - Dewey's going to do a great job.\\
57 - Great, and when the long weekend is over,\\
58 - you'll have earned five whole dollars.\\
59 - You told Mom ten. Right, ten.\\
60 - Aren't you a good little listener? Ow!\\
61 - I'm not so sure about this, Hal.\\
62 - Are you sure that Dewey can handle this?\\
63 - Aw, it's no big deal, honey.\\
64 - A job is a good thing for a boy.\\
65 - It teaches him the value of money.\\
66 - It gives him a little self-confidence.\\
67 - Besides, Craig's new place\\
68 - is only two blocks from our house.\\
69 - Hey, you can see our backyard from here.\\
70 - Hey... I almost forgot to show you my itinerary.\\
71 - Yeah, the convention lasts three days.\\
72 - I'll be back early Monday evening.\\
73 - Wow, Craig, I had no idea you were so into comic books.\\
74 - Well, it's not like I'm a freak about it.\\
75 - It just helps me keep my life in perspective.\\
76 - You know, somehow my problems seem insignificant\\
77 - when compared to Richie Rich's.\\
78 - Well, it's time to say good-bye, Jelly Belly.\\
79 - Come give Daddy some kissy-kisses.\\
80 - I love you...\\
81 - Yes, I do-do-do... do-do-do-do-...\\
82 - I know, son, but a job's a job.\\
83 - Big news, guys.\\
84 - Things are going to get a lot more interesting around here.\\
85 - What's up?\\
86 - I forget--\\
87 - you guys enjoy wrestling, don't you?\\
88 - Rage in the Cage?!\\
89 - Oh, my God! You're the best brother ever!\\
90 - We're going to have so much f...\\
91 - That's only two tickets.\\
92 - I know.\\
93 - How am I ever going to decide which one of you to take?\\
94 - You deliberately bought two tickets just to torment us?\\
95 - No, of course not.\\
96 - I bought them to see who loves me the most.\\
97 - Now, I know you both love me...\\
98 - but I bet one of you loves me just a little bit more.\\
99 - No. No way. We're not doing another butt-kissing contest.\\
100 - There's got to be another way.\\
101 - Okay, fine. Who's got a quarter?\\
102 - Here. Great.\\
103 - You're in the lead.\\
104 - Maybe you should make me a sandwich.\\
105 - Oh, come on, guys. It's Rage in the Cage!\\
106 - You should be happy!\\
107 - We are happy.\\
108 - Well, you're not doing the happy dance.\\
109 - Happy dance, happy dance, we love to do the happy dance.\\
110 - Happier.\\
111 - Happy dance, happy dance,\\
112 - we love to do the happy dance.\\
113 - Happier.\\
114 - Happy dance, happy dance, we love to do the...!\\
115 - A half-cup of wet food in one bowl\\
116 - and a half-cup of dry in another.\\
117 - He likes the juice from the wet half\\
118 - poured onto the dry.\\
119 - Jellybean also likes you better than your brothers.\\
120 - Everyone likes you better than your brothers.\\
121 - Someday, you're going to be president of Idaho\\
122 - and anyone taller than you will be fed to wolves.\\
123 - Time for your eardrops, Jellybean.\\
124 - Okay, Jellybean, stop hiding.\\
125 - Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.\\
126 - Okay, come on.\\
127 - Please don't go outside, Jellybean.\\
128 - Don't be scared, Jellybean.\\
129 - They're just eardrops. See?\\
130 - Jellybean!\\
131 - Jellybean!\\
132 -        \\
133 - Turn.\\
134 - Hey, Ma, can I borrow the car to go over to Richie's house?\\
135 - Uh, no.\\
136 - Why not?\\
137 - Because whenever you return the car, it's always filthy.\\
138 - That is so unfair.\\
139 - You always assume the worst of me.\\
140 - Assume? I see it.\\
141 - How am I going to show you that I've actually grown up\\
142 - if you never give me the chance?!\\
143 - Okay, I'm listening.\\
144 - Okay, how about if I wash the car before I take it?\\
145 - And I'll rake the leaves and I'll scoop out the gutters,\\
146 - and if that's not enough, I'll clean the whole attic!\\
147 - Mom, give him a break.\\
148 - Okay, you got yourself a deal.\\
149 - Bring it home in one piece.\\
150 - You need anything ironed, Mom?\\
151 - Dewey? You in here, son?\\
152 - What's wrong, son?\\
153 - You were supposed to be home hours ago.\\
154 - I can't do anything right.\\
155 - Dewey.\\
156 - Where's Jellybean?\\
157 - I left the door open, and he ran away.\\
158 - Oh, dear.\\
159 - Do we have to tell Mom?\\
160 - Well, this is a very serious situation, son.\\
161 - Of course we're not going to tell your mother.\\
162 - Really?\\
163 - Really.\\
164 - But I think it might be a little bit\\
165 - too much responsibility for your first job.\\
166 - Hey, don't worry, we'll find Jellybean.\\
167 - But I've been looking for hours.\\
168 - Well, that's your first lesson, Dewey.\\
169 - Sometimes it takes a lot of time and hard work\\
170 - to accomplish something.\\
171 - But what if Jellybean's hurt?\\
172 - It's dark outside.\\
173 - Let me tell you a little something\\
174 - about cats, all right?\\
175 - They're nocturnal creatures,\\
176 - which means they prefer the night.\\
177 - Then again, so do coyotes and feral dogs\\
178 - and devil worshippers.\\
179 - My point is that Jellybean is fine.\\
180 - He'll come home when he's good and ready.\\
181 - We're just going to put a little bowl of food out,\\
182 - and he'll come back.\\
183 - Are you sure?\\
184 - Trust me, tomorrow morning, everything is going to be fine.\\
185 - Dad! Jellybean's bowl is empty!\\
186 - He was here!\\
187 - You're the smartest man in the world!\\
188 - Yes!\\
189 - No sign of forced entry.\\
190 - I just don't see how these guys got in.\\
191 - It's a mystery.\\
192 - You left the window open.\\
193 - Mystery solved. I'm sorry,\\
194 - what is it you say you're doing here again?\\
195 - We're watching the cat while the owner's away.\\
196 - I don't see a cat.\\
197 - We're not doing a very good job.\\
198 - Hello?\\
199 - Hal?\\
200 - Oh, Craig! Hi!\\
201 - How's the convention?\\
202 - Fantastic.\\
203 - I've picked up some great bargains.\\
204 - You would not believe some of the idiots that are here.\\
205 - Anyhow, I just called to see how Jellybean's doing.\\
206 - Oh, fine. He's a frisky little guy, you know.\\
207 - Oh, get off the TV, Jellybean!\\
208 - That reminds me--\\
209 - could you hit the timer button on my VCR?\\
210 - I want to tape  Arliss.\\
211 - Uh...\\
212 - Sure, no problem.\\
213 - Hey, Hal, um, I don't want you to think I'm weird, but...\\
214 - could you put Jellybean on the phone?\\
215 - Uh, yeah, let me just...\\
216 - pick him up, yeah...\\
217 - There he is!\\
218 - Okay...\\
219 - Okay, I got his ear to the phone!\\
220 - Hey, Jellybean!\\
221 - How's my widdle pussycat?\\
222 - Have you been a good boy\\
223 - while I've been away?\\
224 - I love you, honey.\\
225 - Give Daddy a kiss.\\
226 - Jellybean?\\
227 - I got to tell you, Reese, you are doing a great job.\\
228 - I am very impressed.\\
229 - Thank you.\\
230 - Here?\\
231 - Nah, one over.\\
232 - I just want to point out\\
233 - that Malcolm has not done a thing,\\
234 - and I have been carrying you around all afternoon.\\
235 - Don't think your enthusiasm\\
236 - and that pathetic look of desperation\\
237 - are going unnoticed.\\
238 - Here you go, Francis.\\
239 - What's this?\\
240 - Your English term paper\\
241 - on the rise of the novel.\\
242 - It's a guaranteed "A."\\
243 - You can screw off the whole rest of this semester\\
244 - and still pull a "C."\\
245 - This pleases me.\\
246 - Jellybean!\\
247 - Come on, Jellybean.\\
248 - Come to Hal.\\
249 - That's a good pussycat.\\
250 - That's a good pussycat.\\
251 - Stay right where you... Damn!\\
252 - Come back here, Jellybean!\\
253 - Jellybean! You want some kissy-kisses?!\\
254 - Kissy-kisses!\\
255 - What is it?\\
256 - What?\\
257 - You know, I realized something.\\
258 - You could do Francis's homework for the next ten years,\\
259 - but you still can't go to Rage in the Cage\\
260 - if you're grounded.\\
261 - What are you talking about?\\
262 - Mom!\\
263 - What is with you, Reese?\\
264 - You've got to get in there\\
265 - and see what Malcolm did to Dewey.\\
266 - He's totally lost it! Hey, Mom.\\
267 - Where's Dewey?\\
268 - He left early to go feed Craig's cat.\\
269 - No way!\\
270 - Huh?\\
271 - What is going on with you, Reese?\\
272 - Oh!\\
273 - Dewey, wait till you see who I found...\\
274 - What happened to your face?\\
275 - What happened to your pants?\\
276 - Never mind that.\\
277 - Look who I have.\\
278 - Mrs. Johnson's cat?\\
279 - Yes... Mrs. Johnson's cat, yes!\\
280 - Go, scoot.\\
281 -        \\
282 - Hey! I found these in the laundry in my shirt pocket!\\
283 - You put them there, didn't you?!\\
284 - Yeah, just like you put my muddy sneaker on the kitchen table!\\
285 - Guys, what's going on?\\
286 - He's trying to get me grounded so I can't go with you,\\
287 - but he's too stupid to pull it off!\\
288 - We'll see who's stupid when this stupid\\
289 - is watching a wrestling match.\\
290 - Whoa, guys, this is\\
291 - supposed to be a contest about love,\\
292 - and you've twisted it into something ugly.\\
293 - Carry on.\\
294 - Get off me! Get off! Ow!\\
295 - This, too, pleases me.\\
296 - Okay, we can fix this.\\
297 - Cats are territorial.\\
298 - I'd put money on it that Jellybean hasn't been\\
299 - outside a square block of this place.\\
300 - Ooh!\\
301 - Yup, he's been back.\\
302 - These are fresh.\\
303 - But he never stays.\\
304 - Well, then we'll just have to find\\
305 - a way to keep him here, won't we?\\
306 - Paid a little visit to my doctor.\\
307 - What are those?\\
308 - These are sleeping pills, Dewey.\\
309 - I simply told him I've been up for the past few nights,\\
310 - things aren't going well with the wife,\\
311 - afraid I'm going to lose the house...\\
312 - But don't you worry, son.\\
313 - Those are just lies I told to get prescription drugs.\\
314 - Now, we're just going to grind a few of these up,\\
315 - sprinkle it on his food,\\
316 - and it's sweet dreams, Jellybean.\\
317 - Should we put them in the wet or the dry?\\
318 - The wet, dry, milk, water--\\
319 - we have to cover all our bases, son.\\
320 - We are going to get this cat!\\
321 - Which one's Jellybean?\\
322 - Well, that's another challenge.\\
323 - We'll make three piles:\\
324 - "Probably Not Jellybean," "Definitely Not Jellybean,"\\
325 - and... "Not Even a Cat."\\
326 - We'll start with that possum.\\
327 - I think it's time to call Mom.\\
328 - I was hoping you'd say that.\\
329 - Rage in the Cage. Rage in the Cage.\\
330 - What are you doing?\\
331 - Wait till Mom sees what you did to my expensive microscope.\\
332 - You don't have the guts.\\
333 - Say you quit, Reese.\\
334 - No! You're going to totally be grounded\\
335 - when Mom sees the beating you gave me.\\
336 - What are you doing?\\
337 - Sucker!\\
338 - Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?\\
339 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
340 - This isn't about the tickets, is it?\\
341 - You have to decide. Who's going with you?!\\
342 - Oh, yeah, I probably should've said something.\\
343 - I met this girl at the Burger Barn,\\
344 - and guess what?\\
345 - She likes wrestling.\\
346 - What? You can't.\\
347 - Guys, it's a  girl...\\
348 - who likes  wrestling.\\
349 - I'm just as much a victim as you are.\\
350 - Aw, you'll understand when you're older.\\
351 - You guys are cool.\\
352 - I'm definitely bringing you home a couple programs.\\
353 - You're telling me none of these cats is Jellybean?\\
354 - What's wrong with you?!\\
355 - Come on, Lois, this is a very complicated situation.\\
356 - Don't blame Dewey.\\
357 - I am not blaming Dewey.\\
358 - Oh.\\
359 - Mom, maybe we can...\\
360 - Dewey, it's okay, just let your mom take care of it.\\
361 - Now here's what we're going to do.\\
362 - Okay, I'll say it.\\
363 - It was a really bad idea.\\
364 - I'll tell you one thing--\\
365 - I've never seen 50 cats run out of a place so fast.\\
366 - Hal, how could this have happened?\\
367 - We've ruined Craig's life.\\
368 - No, no, it is not our fault, Lois.\\
369 - At a certain point, we simply have to say\\
370 - to ourselves that Craig is just cursed.\\
371 - Dad, it's Jellybean!\\
372 - Oh, my God!\\
373 - Oh, my God.\\
374 - Let me just grind up one of these sleeping pills.\\
375 - Won't take a minute. Keep him entertained.\\
376 - Or we could just pick him up.\\
377 - Yay!\\
378 - You see, Dewey, I told you everything would work out.\\
379 - You know, it doesn't pay as well\\
380 - as some other summer jobs,\\
381 - but I get the chance to mentor inner-city children.\\
382 - And how can you put a price on smiles?\\
383 - Oh, you're cute  and  sweet.\\
384 - You know, this is the first time I've gone out in six months.\\
385 - Then... we'll have to make this\\
386 - a night to remember, won't we?\\
387 - Amateurs.\\
388 - What?\\
389 - Oh, it's nothing.\\
390 - It's just a prank from...\\
391 - some of the kids at the center.\\
392 - You know, it's inspiring how they can laugh\\
393 - after all they've been through.\\
394 - Oh, man!\\
395 - I wasn't speeding, was I?\\
396 - I don't think so.\\
397 - License and registration.\\
398 - Officer, what did I do?\\
399 - This car has been reported stolen.\\
400 - License and registration, please.\\
401 - Oh, it's been reported stolen, huh?\\
402 - I'm not going to ask you again. License and registration.\\
403 - Look, Officer, I know this looks bad, but...\\
404 - Open the trunk, sir.\\
405 - Officer, let me explain...\\
406 - Open the trunk!\\
407 - Get out of the car!\\
408 - Mom wasn't too thrilled\\
409 - about having to pick us up at the police station,\\
410 - but it was totally worth it.\\
411 - We don't have to serve Francis anymore.\\
412 - Here's your sandwich, Craig.\\
413 - Can I go to bed now?\\
414 - Ooh, mayo on only one side?\\
415 - It's a lot of mayo.\\
416 - No one's saying it's not,\\
417 - but I specifically asked for it on both sides.\\
418 - Craig... Malcolm,\\
419 - I don't like this any more than you do,\\
420 - but it was your mom's idea.\\
421 - Since as long as I'm living here you have to do everything I say,\\
422 - I'll try to meet you halfway and make my orders\\
423 - as clear as possible, okay, champ?\\
424 - Here, I heated it for ten seconds just like you said.\\
425 - It's still not quite room temperature.\\
426 - Look, I know I'm being demanding,\\
427 - but Jellybean's apartment was burned down, too.\\
428 - All right, it was almost worth it.\\
429 - There's something you have to see.\\
430 - Cut.\\
431 - Oh, honey, the night is still young.\\
432 - What's the line?\\
433 - I'm sorry.\\
434 - Cut.\\
435 - Ow!\\
436 - Cut.\\
437 - Shut up! We wouldn't be in this mess\\
438 - if you hadn't called for help.\\
439 - Keep... pushing me...\\
440 - ass.\\
441 - Would you guys stop laughing?\\
442 - Dang, it's not that funny.\\
443 - Craig, you can't say "ass."\\
444 - Keep...\\
445 - pushing me...\\
446 - ass.\\
447 - Whoo!\\
448 - Cut! Cut!\\
449 - Now, honey, I'm sorry you had to see that.
\subsection {Episode 22: Mini-Bike}
1 - Oh, my God. Hal, look at this.\\
2 - We still have a Christmas present for one of the boys.\\
3 - I wonder what it is.\\
4 - Reese ever get that football jersey?\\
5 - I can't remember.\\
6 - Well, you know, honey,\\
7 - the boys got so much for Christmas last year,\\
8 - they don't even appreciate what they have.\\
9 - If we save it for his birthday,\\
10 - it'll be that much more special.\\
11 - Hal, this one's for you.\\
12 - Oh, boy! You did get me\\
13 - that DVD player I've been hoping for.\\
14 - I thought you forgot.\\
15 - To be honest with you,\\
16 - I've been holding a grudge for months.\\
17 - Now I get to watch all those DVDs I've got hidden\\
18 - in the garage.\\
19 - Oh.\\
20 - Jumper cables.\\
21 - Thank you, honey.\\
22 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
23 -     I don't know    \\
24 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
32 -     And you're not so big    \\
33 -     Life is unfair.    \\
34 - Oh, this is ridiculous.\\
35 - Craig has been in there for 45 minutes.\\
36 -     God, I hope I get it    \\
37 -     I hope I get it    \\
38 -     How many people does he need?    \\
39 - How long is he going to be living with us?\\
40 - Look, we have to be patient with him.\\
41 - We burned the man's house down.\\
42 -     How many boys, how many girls?    \\
43 -     He doesn't like the way I look    \\
44 -     He doesn't like the way I dance    \\
45 -     He doesn't like the way...    \\
46 - That's it, we're opening the door.\\
47 - Someone go get me a coat hanger.\\
48 - I did that yesterday, Dad.\\
49 - Trust me, don't go in there.\\
50 - He's done when he's done.\\
51 - Hey, everyone.\\
52 - Say good morning, Jellybean.\\
53 - Oh...\\
54 - dear Lord.\\
55 - We burned his house down.\\
56 - You know, I'm really excited\\
57 - about this father-son weekend at Marlin.\\
58 - Spend some time with Francis, do some male bonding,\\
59 - maybe even a survival hike.\\
60 - You have your fluffy pillow?\\
61 - Right here.\\
62 - I'm really going to miss you.\\
63 - Oh...\\
64 - Come with me.\\
65 - I can't. I'm not allowed.\\
66 - It's fathers and sons only.\\
67 - Well, I'll hide you.\\
68 - No one will know.\\
69 - You can be my dirty little secret.\\
70 - Now this is nice.\\
71 - And don't you worry about a thing, Hal.\\
72 - I'll take as good care of your house as you did mine.\\
73 - I'm just kidding.\\
74 - I won't burn your house down.\\
75 - But that's all in the past. Totally forgotten.\\
76 - Better get going, though. Don't want to be late.\\
77 - Thanks.\\
78 - Bye, honey.\\
79 - Bye. Bye.\\
80 - Uh, Lois,\\
81 - I'm aware this isn't the most comfortable situation here,\\
82 - having me around all the time,\\
83 - the forbidden fruit, as it were.\\
84 - Especially now, with Hal gone.\\
85 - Yeah, Craig, it's not... But, shh...\\
86 - Whatever feelings we shared...\\
87 - that's in the past.\\
88 - That part of us is dead now.\\
89 - Craig, I... Shh, shh, shh!\\
90 - Let's not rekindle this.\\
91 - You know, if you're not allowed\\
92 - to keep a squirrel in your locker,\\
93 - they should put up a sign.\\
94 - I'm not psychic. I can't read minds.\\
95 - Look.\\
96 - No, Dewey, let's go.\\
97 - No, it's a minibike.\\
98 - Someone's just throwing it away?\\
99 - Man, that would be so cool to have.\\
100 - Wait! Wait!\\
101 - Wait.\\
102 - You can't throw that out.\\
103 - This?\\
104 - It's a piece of trash.\\
105 - What are you talking about?\\
106 - That's not trash.\\
107 - You don't know what trash is.\\
108 - I am a garbage man.\\
109 - Look, why don't you give us the bike?\\
110 - Maybe we can fix it up or something.\\
111 - What's it worth to you?\\
112 - What? We don't have any money.\\
113 - You were just about to throw it away.\\
114 - Give you 30 bucks.\\
115 - Done.\\
116 - Where'd you get 30 bucks?\\
117 - What are you, a cop?\\
118 - Hey, Lois.\\
119 - Just fighting Father Time.\\
120 - Craig, I have to work late tonight.\\
121 - Would you mind feeding the boys?\\
122 - No problem.\\
123 - Thanks.\\
124 - So, uh, I'm in charge, then?\\
125 - All you have to do is fix them some dinner. Right.\\
126 - But I'm completely in charge.\\
127 - They got to listen to me.\\
128 - Dance for me.\\
129 - That's right, dance. Why?\\
130 - 'Cause I'm in charge, that's why.\\
131 - We burned his house down.\\
132 - Look at it. It was just dirty.\\
133 - The paint job's perfect.\\
134 - And all it needs is a spark plug and a carburetor\\
135 - and it'll be working.\\
136 - We can get that stuff off Dad's lawnmower.\\
137 - This minibike is the coolest thing\\
138 - we've ever had in our lives.\\
139 - This totally makes up for all the years of crap.\\
140 - This is the only thing we've ever shared.\\
141 - This is the only thing we've had that's worth sharing.\\
142 - The first thing I'm gonna do\\
143 - is go down to Principal Littledove's house\\
144 - and cut donuts on his front lawn.\\
145 - Okay, why don't you take it tomorrow and Wednesday\\
146 - and I'll take it on... Excuse me?\\
147 - What? What are you doing?\\
148 - Nothing, I'm just making up a schedule.\\
149 - Why do you get to make up the schedule?\\
150 - What's the problem?\\
151 - I'm giving you the first day.\\
152 - So what?\\
153 - You're not the boss of everyone.\\
154 - Look, I'm the one who put together the engine.\\
155 - Well, I'm the one that paid for it.\\
156 - You wouldn't even have it if I didn't see it.\\
157 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
158 - You shut up!\\
159 - Look, it's not even fixed yet.\\
160 - There's no point in fighting...\\
161 - I get it on Sundays!\\
162 - You do not!\\
163 - Dewey, you're too short to even ride it.\\
164 - I'm in the 40th percentile.\\
165 - And you're too stupid to ride it.\\
166 - Would you guys chill out?\\
167 - Shut up! Yeah, Malcolm!\\
168 - You may be able to boss around\\
169 - your loser Krelboynes,\\
170 - but normal people don't have to listen to you.\\
171 - Quit talking and hit him.\\
172 - You don't have any friends.\\
173 - Mom told you you're never allowed to talk about that.\\
174 - Let's have a hand\\
175 - for Cadet Drew and his father,\\
176 - direct from the showrooms\\
177 - of Atlantic City.\\
178 - That was just riveting.\\
179 - And, now, we have a few more awards to give out.\\
180 - Now, now,\\
181 - we have a lot of students, and they all deserve recognition.\\
182 - The award for the best history essay\\
183 - by a junior or sophomore goes to...\\
184 - Cadet Eric.\\
185 - Congratulations.\\
186 - Thanks.\\
187 - We're so proud of our Eric.\\
188 - We're the luckiest dads in the world.\\
189 - It  was  a great essay.\\
190 - I had a shot at the "C" till he screwed up the curve.\\
191 - They sure are giving out a lot of awards, huh?\\
192 - Yeah, I'm sorry. This is just ridiculous.\\
193 - He gives these things out like candy.\\
194 - And now\\
195 - the award for the cadet\\
196 - who has shown the most improvement.\\
197 - This young lad came to Marlin as a delinquent jack-a-ninny\\
198 - without the slightest sign of potential.\\
199 - And yet, in a mere year and a half,\\
200 - he has started\\
201 - to turn himself around.\\
202 - He's not all the way there yet,\\
203 - but he is on the path to becoming\\
204 - an outstanding member of the Marlin family.\\
205 - I proudly present...\\
206 - Cadet Gordie.\\
207 - This is nice, you know?\\
208 - Sitting around with family, eating together, sharing.\\
209 - What'd you do today, buddy?\\
210 - Nothing. I'm too short.\\
211 - I wouldn't worry about that, sport.\\
212 - I bet you probably have the biggest head\\
213 - in your whole class.\\
214 - Am I too stupid to have some more peas?\\
215 - I don't think there are any rules on that, Chief.\\
216 - Yeah, this is nice.\\
217 - I remember when I was your age, not a care in the world.\\
218 - Me and my imaginary brother\\
219 - outside in the yard building forts all day.\\
220 - Yep, good times.\\
221 - Where do you think you're going?\\
222 - To the garage!\\
223 - Not alone, you're not!\\
224 - I'm coming, too!\\
225 - You're all excused.\\
226 - Kids.\\
227 - Hey, genius,\\
228 - you going to be done any time this year?\\
229 - If you'd just shut up and left me alone, it'd be fixed by now.\\
230 - You two disgust me.\\
231 - All right, this should do it.\\
232 - Let me do it.\\
233 - I'm doing it. Me, me, me, me!\\
234 - I told you I could fix it.\\
235 - Way to go, jackass. Now get out of my way.\\
236 - Get off! It's mine! No!\\
237 - It's mine! Get off!\\
238 - It's mine! Mine! Move!\\
239 - I found it and I fixed it!\\
240 - It's mine! Leave it alone!\\
241 - It's mine!\\
242 - It's nobody's!\\
243 - What's wrong with you kids?\\
244 - You're not allowed to have a motorcycle.\\
245 - What are you doing? Yeah, that's ours!\\
246 - We paid for it with our own money!\\
247 - Well, that was pretty stupid of you, wasn't it?\\
248 - There's no way you're having a motorcycle.\\
249 - But, Mom, it's not a motorcycle.\\
250 - It's just a little minibike.\\
251 - It's a motorcycle.\\
252 - It's  not  a motorcycle!\\
253 - It's two feet high.\\
254 - It was made specifically for kids.\\
255 - Two wheels. Motor. Motorcycle.\\
256 - Look, I... I understand that, uh, Francis\\
257 - is never going to be the perfect kid.\\
258 - You see, what I'm asking for here\\
259 - is, is just a little... ray of hope.\\
260 - Anything at all?\\
261 - Francis is...\\
262 - ...not interested in learning.\\
263 - Francis is...\\
264 - interested in causing trouble.\\
265 - I'm sorry to have to say that, but I have seen his type before.\\
266 - All he likes to do\\
267 - is flout authority.\\
268 - He has contempt for rules.\\
269 - He lives to undermine and destroy.\\
270 - He feels no compunction...\\
271 - Okay.\\
272 - I get it.\\
273 - Isn't there anything positive you can tell me?\\
274 - Sorry.\\
275 - Oh, wait.\\
276 - Yes?\\
277 - Do you want chicken or fish tonight?\\
278 - Look, Mom, I don't think you realize\\
279 - how much we really want this bike.\\
280 - I looked over your tax return, and I think I could save you\\
281 - about $1,200...\\
282 - if you make it worth my while.\\
283 - No.\\
284 - You know that dog that keeps you up every night?\\
285 - I could take him for a little... "walk."\\
286 - No!\\
287 - I want it! I want it!\\
288 - I hate you! I want it!\\
289 - I wish I was dead!\\
290 - Detailed information on every unsolved breakage\\
291 - or disappearance in this house for the last two years.\\
292 - No!\\
293 - Doing laundry, huh?\\
294 - Yes, Craig.\\
295 - Well, don't even think of doing my stuff.\\
296 - I'm the only guy that handles my used underpants,\\
297 - thank you very much.\\
298 - Of course, shame to waste electricity\\
299 - if you got the room.\\
300 - Okay, Mom, we thought about it\\
301 - and we understand\\
302 - that you're worried about us getting hurt,\\
303 - so we promise we'll always wear helmets\\
304 - when we ride the minibike.\\
305 - And in addition to the helmets,\\
306 - we'll also wear elbow and knee pads\\
307 - no matter how dorky we look.\\
308 - And we'll only ride it in the park.\\
309 - And only under your supervision\\
310 - when you say so and when you're with us.\\
311 - No.\\
312 - Wait!\\
313 - No!\\
314 - This isn't fair!\\
315 - You don't get to just say no!\\
316 - Yes, I do. No, you don't!\\
317 - You can't just make a blanket statement\\
318 - that covers everything.\\
319 - There has to be some scenario\\
320 - where you'll let us ride the bike.\\
321 - I mean, what if I was a trained athlete\\
322 - who practiced on a simulator for 15 years\\
323 - and wore Kevlar body armor in a field of marshmallows?\\
324 - I would still say no.\\
325 - Now stop bothering me.\\
326 - I don't know, Lois.\\
327 - The boys sound pretty reasonable to me.\\
328 - Stay out of this, Craig.\\
329 - Hey! I live here, too, don't I?\\
330 - Sorry, baby.\\
331 - Mom's just doing this 'cause she can't stand\\
332 - that we were actually working together.\\
333 - I know. Fixing that bike up was the best time we ever had.\\
334 - I never wanted it to end.\\
335 - Yeah. We were a perfect team.\\
336 - We still are.\\
337 - The three of us, we're going to work together\\
338 - and find a way to beat her.\\
339 - She's going down.\\
340 - Hey... wait a minute.\\
341 - Boys! I need some help!\\
342 - Oh.\\
343 - What's this?\\
344 - Looks like a picture of you on a horse.\\
345 - What were you, about Dewey's age?\\
346 - What are you doing with this?\\
347 - This looks awfully dangerous.\\
348 - Look at that.\\
349 - No padding, no helmet.\\
350 - Did you ever fall?\\
351 - What does this have to do with...?\\
352 - We're asking the questions.\\
353 - So, according\\
354 - to your logic,\\
355 - a two-foot fall from a minibike\\
356 - is more dangerous than a six-foot fall\\
357 - from a galloping horse?\\
358 - That was a long time ago.\\
359 - Before gravity?\\
360 - I don't have time for this right now.\\
361 - I have to get ready...\\
362 - I have to go to work.\\
363 - Did you see that?\\
364 - We totally rattled her! Yeah!\\
365 - We did it!\\
366 - It worked!\\
367 - We've got Mom!\\
368 - What?\\
369 - There's a chink in the armor!\\
370 - We're going to do it!\\
371 - If we just play it cool, have a little patience,\\
372 - we'll have the minibike by the end of the week!\\
373 - No, we won't.\\
374 - It's broken.\\
375 - What?\\
376 - I snuck it out for a ride.\\
377 - And you know what?\\
378 - They  are  dangerous.\\
379 - You think Mom will notice?\\
380 - You moron! Do you have any idea what you've done?\\
381 - We were so close! We had her!\\
382 - That's what I figured.\\
383 - I wouldn't have taken it otherwise.\\
384 - I'm not an idiot.\\
385 - I can't believe you would...\\
386 - How was it?\\
387 - It was awesome.\\
388 - I looked really cool doing it.\\
389 - I could see my reflection in the car windows\\
390 - right up until I hit the mailbox.\\
391 - Sometimes you just embarrass me.\\
392 - It's okay. Mom doesn't have to find out.\\
393 - I'll be fine.\\
394 - My leg's really starting to feel better.\\
395 - Let's see it. Ow!\\
396 - Hi, Mom! Hello.\\
397 - Look, boys, I was thinking about it,\\
398 - and, uh, you're old enough to deserve an explanation.\\
399 - I was...\\
400 - You don't always know what's best for us!\\
401 - You don't know that we would have gotten hurt!\\
402 - There's such a thing as trust!\\
403 - I  really  think we've earned it!\\
404 - Reese, I'm not saying that I... I don't have\\
405 - to sit here and listen to this!\\
406 - Yes, you do. Oh, right.\\
407 - Look, I'll tell you what.\\
408 - How about I take you to the skateboard park tonight, huh?\\
409 - How does that sound?\\
410 - Actually, I'm pretty tired.\\
411 - Me, too, and I think I really want to get a jump\\
412 - on next week's homework.\\
413 - What's going on?\\
414 - You guys are...\\
415 - Lois! Lois!\\
416 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
417 - What is it now?\\
418 - What's the matter, Craig?\\
419 - What does it say on this jar?\\
420 - "Craig."\\
421 - Well, I'm glad someone around here can read.\\
422 - These jars come with 14 pickles in them.\\
423 - I had three yesterday, two for lunch today\\
424 - and one-and-a-half for a snack,\\
425 - and now there are six-and-a-half pickles in this jar!\\
426 - Simple math indicates...\\
427 - Are you counting the one in your hand?\\
428 - Okay, false alarm.\\
429 - We burned his house down. We burned his house down.\\
430 - Oh,  this  is the guy.\\
431 - This  is Francis.\\
432 - What I want to know is,\\
433 - how did you get the cow\\
434 - onto the roof of the gymnasium\\
435 - in the first place?\\
436 - Ah, that was easy.\\
437 - The parachute was the problem.\\
438 - Did you know those things don't open\\
439 - unless you're thousands of feet in the air?\\
440 - You live, you learn.\\
441 - Did I ever tell you about that?\\
442 - No.\\
443 - Look at this: archery, debating, field hockey...\\
444 - Look at all these clubs and teams,\\
445 - and you're not in any of them.\\
446 - There isn't even a picture of you in the yearbook.\\
447 - Look under Pete Zahut.\\
448 - I don't want to look under Pete Zahut.\\
449 - No, no, no, if you say it fast, it sounds like...\\
450 - I don't believe this.\\
451 - Francis... don't you care about anything?\\
452 - What?\\
453 - In a school filled with problem children,\\
454 - you're the worst one here.\\
455 - Wait, that's not true.\\
456 - I can think of three other guys\\
457 - with longer records than I have.\\
458 - We have worked and we've worked,\\
459 - trying anything we can think of to turn you around,\\
460 - but nothing seems to get through to you.\\
461 - Come on, Dad.\\
462 - No. You don't give a damn about anything but yourself!\\
463 - And, Francis, I don't like saying these things,\\
464 - but what am I supposed to do?\\
465 - I-I feel like I have to give up on my own son.\\
466 - Dad...\\
467 - You know, I can't even look at you right now.\\
468 - I don't remember if we're hating each other\\
469 - or liking each other, but either way\\
470 - I appreciate this.\\
471 - Ah, it's been two hours, Reese.\\
472 - The swelling isn't going down.\\
473 - Look, you can see his heartbeat.\\
474 - Oh, man. We really need to get you to the hospital.\\
475 - We can't! Mom will kill us if she finds out about the bike.\\
476 - This isn't about the bike!\\
477 - We're screwed for the next five years\\
478 - on anything we'd like to do.\\
479 - There's got to be some way we can get you to the hospital\\
480 - before she finds out.\\
481 - Then we could come up with a cover story.\\
482 - Could you handle that? Because I'm going to scream\\
483 - into my pillow for the next five minutes.\\
484 - There's got to be some way we can do this.\\
485 - Have you seen Jellybean's sweater?\\
486 - I don't know why we have to go all the way across town.\\
487 - Seems kind of silly.\\
488 - Craig, I promise, it's the best ice cream in town.\\
489 - Yeah, well, I'll be the judge of that.\\
490 - What was that?\\
491 - Ow!\\
492 - Ow, my leg!\\
493 - Ow. Ow.\\
494 - Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
495 - Ow!\\
496 - Oh, my God! What did I do? What did I do?\\
497 - You ran over his leg!\\
498 - What happened?\\
499 - Oh, my God! Reese!\\
500 - Ow!\\
501 - Ow!\\
502 - Oh, for God's sakes, Jonathan, pull yourself together.\\
503 - He'll be home for your birthday.\\
504 - You got a problem?\\
505 - An untucked\\
506 - shirttail, Cadet?\\
507 - Is that what we teach you here?\\
508 - To disgrace your uniform?\\
509 - I think not.\\
510 - Sir, his shirt just came untucked\\
511 - when he was hugging his father.\\
512 - You can't yell at him\\
513 - for hugging his father.\\
514 - Francis... No.\\
515 - No, I'm glad you saw this.\\
516 - This is exactly what I was talking about.\\
517 - Always undermining my authority.\\
518 - Day in, day out, it's the same thing.\\
519 - Like when I had Cadet Dooley run 600 laps of the perimeter\\
520 - for an inside-out pillowcase violation,\\
521 - Francis organizes a sit-in.\\
522 - Or when I cut off the electricity\\
523 - to the fifth floor for a contraband boom box,\\
524 - he hijacks a generator\\
525 - for them.\\
526 - The boy lives to cause chaos.\\
527 - He was hugging his dad!\\
528 - In front of his own father,\\
529 - he still defies me at every turn.\\
530 - And every time something like that happens,\\
531 - he challenges you?\\
532 - Every time.\\
533 - Even when he knows he'll get in trouble?\\
534 - That doesn't seem to matter to him at all.\\
535 - I understand.\\
536 - I will deal with you later.\\
537 - Look, Dad, I just want to...\\
538 - Shut up, son.\\
539 - Oh, come here.\\
540 - I can't believe that plan actually worked.\\
541 - We came up with it in, like, two seconds.\\
542 - Maybe we should do more things half-assed.\\
543 - Hey, Reese, how's your leg?\\
544 - Not bad.\\
545 - The pain goes away when I black out.\\
546 - You guys want anything to drink?\\
547 - Sure. Great. All right.\\
548 - One more thing.\\
549 - Did you really think I wouldn't notice\\
550 - a busted up minibike half-buried in the sandbox?\\
551 - Jellybean and I are leaving now.\\
552 - Once again, I'm very sorry.\\
553 - I can't even look you people in the eye.\\
554 - I think we'll call this one a wash.\\
555 - I love you, Francis.\\
556 - Good-bye.\\
557 - Love you, too, Dad.
\subsection {Episode 23: Carnival}
1 - Ooh! Aah!\\
2 - Ooh!\\
3 - Ooh! Ooh!\\
4 - Hal!\\
5 - I'm late for work!\\
6 - When your TV privileges are taken away,\\
7 - you have to do something for entertainment.\\
8 - This is totally a trade-up.\\
9 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
10 -     I don't know    \\
11 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     Life is unfair.    \\
21 - Well, I've solved two mysteries:\\
22 - Why the toaster was stinking up the house\\
23 - and where Dewey left his goldfish.\\
24 - Hal, would you put on a decent shirt?\\
25 - Stevie's here.\\
26 - So?\\
27 - So, I like having him around.\\
28 - Look, he's actually got the boys reading the newspaper.\\
29 - Wait.\\
30 - I haven't... finished yet.\\
31 - Hey, check it out--\\
32 - the county fair.\\
33 - Look at that-- they got a roller coaster,\\
34 - a side show, knife throwers.\\
35 - Your name...\\
36 - written on... rice.\\
37 - Oh, man, this is the last weekend.\\
38 - We've got to go.\\
39 - Yeah, like Mom will ever let us go.\\
40 - Why does...\\
41 - she have... to know?\\
42 - You got an idea?\\
43 - Maybe... you guys...\\
44 - could come... for a sleepover.\\
45 - Your parents aren't going to let us go to the fair.\\
46 - They'll think... that I'm...\\
47 - sleeping... at your house.\\
48 - Double alibi.\\
49 - It's a classic for a reason.\\
50 - Can you... talk your mom...\\
51 - into... sleeping over?\\
52 - Mom, can we sleep over at Stevie's tonight?\\
53 - Sure!\\
54 - Now for... my parents.\\
55 - A sleepover?! At someone else's house?!\\
56 - Don't you like sleeping here, son?\\
57 - I don't think this is a good idea, Steve.\\
58 - I mean, Malcolm's family doesn't have a HEPA filter air purifier\\
59 - and God knows how outmoded their alarm system is.\\
60 - They probably don't even have motion detectors.\\
61 - Be honest, son.\\
62 - Is it my snoring?\\
63 - You have a perfectly good\\
64 - hypo-allergenic mattress here to sleep on.\\
65 - I just don't see the point.\\
66 - I would help... me feel...\\
67 - normal.\\
68 - Fish... in a barrel.\\
69 - All right. See you there.\\
70 - Stevie's in. We're all set.\\
71 - He's going to meet us at the bus stop in half an hour.\\
72 - We take the 37 express to the fair\\
73 - have fun for a little while, and we're back home by midnight.\\
74 - You little creep!\\
75 - Let go!\\
76 - What did you hear?\\
77 - Everything.\\
78 - I want to go to the fair.\\
79 - No, Dewey. You're too young.\\
80 - Take me or I'll tell Mom.\\
81 - If you do, I'll just stomp the crap out of you.\\
82 - Go ahead. I'm still telling.\\
83 - Dewey, you're not going and you're not telling.\\
84 - If you blab to Mom, we'll take every pet you ever get\\
85 - and set it free.\\
86 - We'll destroy every toy, every game,\\
87 - everything you ever love.\\
88 - Do what you have to.\\
89 - Dewey's going to go with us to Stevie's.\\
90 - Why?\\
91 - Because we like him.\\
92 - I'm just fun.\\
93 - And Stevie's mom is okay with this? Yeah.\\
94 - Maybe so, but she has no idea what she's getting into\\
95 - with the three of you over there.\\
96 - I should give her a call...\\
97 - Uh, honey, Kitty can speak up for herself.\\
98 - I mean, she's made a decision.\\
99 - I don't think we should be second-guessing her.\\
100 - What?!\\
101 - Though with Dewey gone, too,\\
102 - we'll have to try to think of something to do...\\
103 - on our own... alone.\\
104 - Okay, boys, have fun.\\
105 - Bye, now.\\
106 -        \\
107 - Oh, Hal...\\
108 - we got the whole night.\\
109 - Here-- heat up the rolls.\\
110 - Daddy'll just kill me if he catches me\\
111 - with one of the field hands.\\
112 - Let the machine get it.\\
113 - Hello, it's Francis.\\
114 - Mom, Dad, pick up.\\
115 - I'm in the emergency room\\
116 - and the doctors think they can save my leg, but they--\\
117 - Francis, are you okay?\\
118 - Ha! Screening your own child.\\
119 - Fine parents you are.\\
120 - Honey, what's wrong?\\
121 - The fact that I have to resort to lies\\
122 - to get you to talk to me-- that's what's wrong.\\
123 - What do you want, Francis?\\
124 - I don't know. It's Saturday night.\\
125 - I thought I'd call and say hi.\\
126 - Can we call you back later? Your dad and I are kind of busy right now.\\
127 - All right, let me talk to my brothers.\\
128 - They're not here.\\
129 - Then what are you...?\\
130 - Ew!\\
131 - Ugh!\\
132 -        \\
133 - Ugh!\\
134 - Ugh!\\
135 - Where is everybody... going?\\
136 - They're leaving!\\
137 - This place is closing in 15 minutes!\\
138 - We would've been here two hours ago\\
139 - if we didn't have to get off the express bus!\\
140 - I had to pee!\\
141 - You cost us two hours!\\
142 - Just for that, you don't get to see the Siamese pigs.\\
143 - No!\\
144 - Can we...\\
145 - stop fighting...\\
146 - and start... living?\\
147 - Okay, we only have time for one ride\\
148 - so we need to make it count.\\
149 - How about the Chamber of Terrors?\\
150 - It's on the other side of the midway.\\
151 - Ride's closed.\\
152 - What?! We've still got five minutes!\\
153 - Not according to my watch.\\
154 - Hey, you have to let us ride.\\
155 - This is a  county  fair.\\
156 - It belongs to the  people.\\
157 - I mean, what are our tax dollars paying for, anyway?\\
158 - The cops, who I'm going to call\\
159 - if you don't get the hell out of here.\\
160 - Ride's closed!\\
161 - That sucks. He's just picking on us because we're kids\\
162 - and we can't do anything about it.\\
163 - I know. This is unfair.\\
164 - He could've let us through.\\
165 - He just has an attitude problem.\\
166 - What happened... to customer service?\\
167 - Are you sure we should be doing this?\\
168 - Stevie might get mad at us just dropping in on him.\\
169 - We're not doing anything wrong.\\
170 - We're his parents, and we happen to be in the neighborhood.\\
171 - You just want to kiss him good night.\\
172 - So what if I do?\\
173 - I've kissed that boy good night every night since he was born.\\
174 - It makes him sleep better and it makes me sleep better.\\
175 - What is taking so long?\\
176 - You know those boys--\\
177 - they're probably watching ninja movies\\
178 - and eating full-fat crackers.\\
179 - Hello?\\
180 - Is everything okay in there?\\
181 - Oh.\\
182 - Kitty, Abe... uh, what are you doing here?\\
183 - Hello, Hal.\\
184 - Is everything okay? We heard a crash.\\
185 - Oh, yeah. Sure.\\
186 - We're just, um... moving furniture.\\
187 - So, what-what brings you by?\\
188 - We just came by to see Stevie.\\
189 - Stevie?!\\
190 - Stevie isn't here.\\
191 - I thought he was with you.\\
192 - What-What are you talking about?\\
193 - Where's my baby?\\
194 - Abe, Kitty, what-what are you doing here?\\
195 - We came to see Stevie.\\
196 - He's not here on a sleepover with your boys?\\
197 - No! They told us they were spending the night\\
198 - at your house for a sleepover.\\
199 - Oh...\\
200 - Hal, get my bra.\\
201 - I guess I should be scared, but I'm not.\\
202 - Fake blood.\\
203 - That's... a zombie?\\
204 - Rubber guts.\\
205 - Okay, if I had paid for this ride, I'd be really pissed.\\
206 - Stevie! Stevie!\\
207 - Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!\\
208 - Stevie!\\
209 - Stevie! Stevie!\\
210 - Kitty, you have to leave a little room between your "Stevies"\\
211 - or you won't be able to hear him yell back.\\
212 - I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.\\
213 - I don't have as much experience\\
214 - with my child being in mortal danger.\\
215 - Okay, just calm down.\\
216 - You have to focus on something positive...\\
217 - like how we're going to punish them.\\
218 - How can I focus on anything\\
219 - when Stevie's out there, lost and scared?\\
220 - I understand what you're feeling, Kitty.\\
221 - I'm concerned, too. We're all concerned.\\
222 - Abe, this van is a palace.\\
223 - What does a rig like this set you back?\\
224 - Eh, not as much as you'd think.\\
225 - When I sprang for the DVD player and flat-screen monitor,\\
226 - they threw in the GPS system for free,\\
227 - so it's really a...\\
228 - Stevie!\\
229 - Stevie! Stevie!\\
230 - Where the hell's the exit?\\
231 - We've been wandering around here for 20 minutes.\\
232 - This place is creepy.\\
233 - Hey guys, we're right back where we started.\\
234 - This is the car we were riding in.\\
235 - I can feel where Dewey was chewing on it.\\
236 - Okay, I think we're out of options.\\
237 - We have to start a fire.\\
238 - Just calm down.\\
239 - We can find our way out of here.\\
240 - We just need to stay together and hold hands.\\
241 - Reese, give me your hand.\\
242 - I thought I was holding your hand.\\
243 - Uh-oh.\\
244 - This is like the beginning\\
245 - of every horror movie I've ever seen.\\
246 - I think we should all split up.\\
247 - This place is like a cemetery\\
248 - with a Ferris wheel.\\
249 - Are we in trouble?\\
250 - No. The last bus leaves in 20 minutes.\\
251 - We just have to get outside and wait for it.\\
252 - Hey.\\
253 - Let's ask... for help.\\
254 - No, we'll get in trouble.\\
255 - Let's climb the fence and get out of here.\\
256 - The fences are, like, 12 feet high.\\
257 - What about Stevie?\\
258 - We do it in stages.\\
259 - We drag his chair to the top,\\
260 - toss it over, and then\\
261 - do the same with Stevie.\\
262 - Hello?!\\
263 - Lost brother?\\
264 - Go for it.\\
265 - Uh, hi.\\
266 - We're really sorry, but our brother got lost\\
267 - and we kind of got stuck in here after closing.\\
268 - Would you mind unlocking the gate\\
269 - and letting us out?\\
270 - We only live a block away.\\
271 - So, we won't be any more trouble.\\
272 - You think the rules don't apply?\\
273 - Excuse me?\\
274 - My boss finds you pissants sneaking in...\\
275 - it's my ass!\\
276 - Is he mad?\\
277 - I don't know.\\
278 - He looks a little...\\
279 - Oh, my God-- side window defrosters.\\
280 - I've never seen that before.\\
281 - Hello?\\
282 - Francis? Hang on.\\
283 - I'm putting you on speakerphone.\\
284 - Who's this?\\
285 - Francis, it's Mom. We need to talk.\\
286 - You know, with the images I have in my brain,\\
287 - I think the best thing for me right now\\
288 - is a little distance and about 15 hours of public television.\\
289 - Francis, would you quit clowning around?\\
290 - The boys are missing.\\
291 - What are you talking about?\\
292 - We were hoping you can\\
293 - give us some ideas of where to look for them.\\
294 - Over.\\
295 - Hal.\\
296 - If you could give us some leads,\\
297 - it might really speed things up.\\
298 - See, he doesn't know you've stopped talking.\\
299 - No, just you're kind of putting me in an awkward position.\\
300 - I mean, you're asking me to rat out my brothers.\\
301 - Francis, we're just worried about the boys.\\
302 - They're not going to get into trouble.\\
303 - Oh? When did they get new parents?\\
304 - Listen, you little miscreant,\\
305 - you better tell me where they are\\
306 - before I jump through the phone\\
307 - and rip that smart mouth off that damn face!\\
308 - Who is that?\\
309 - My name is Kitty Kenarban,\\
310 - and my little boy Stevie is out there lost.\\
311 - His inhaler is running out,\\
312 - and he's got poor night vision.\\
313 - Wait, Stevie's with them?\\
314 - Okay, you didn't hear it from me,\\
315 - but I'd check out the old paint factory.\\
316 - It's fun to blow up the old cans of varnish.\\
317 - Oh, and the knife store on Fifth has a back door that's loose.\\
318 - If Stevie could swim...\\
319 - then I'd guess they'd be 40 miles downstream by now.\\
320 - Look, just start at these places.\\
321 - The others are too alarming,\\
322 - and there's no sense in needlessly scaring you.\\
323 - Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.\\
324 - Puppies, ice cream, fat people falling down.\\
325 - I think we lost him.\\
326 - Where's... Dewey?\\
327 - Oh, my God.\\
328 - Where is he?\\
329 - Look, I say we get out of here.\\
330 - We can cover for Dewey. He's quiet.\\
331 - Mom and Dad will never know he's gone.\\
332 - You don't leave...\\
333 - a fallen... comrade.\\
334 - Shut up. We wouldn't be in this mess\\
335 - if you hadn't called for help.\\
336 - Keep... pushing me... dumb-ass.\\
337 - Look, we can find Dewey.\\
338 - We just need to start on one side of the park,\\
339 - work our way through\\
340 - and stay the hell away from that guard.\\
341 - No way, no way!\\
342 - We stay right here.\\
343 - That maniac's out there somewhere...\\
344 - waiting for us.\\
345 - Save... yourselves!\\
346 - Oh, man, he's got Stevie.\\
347 - We got to do something.\\
348 - Why? Maybe it's his time.\\
349 - Who are we to play God?\\
350 - Reese!\\
351 - What is taking him so long?\\
352 - How many places could the boys hide in an impound lot?\\
353 - Start the car!\\
354 - Start the car!\\
355 - Go, go!\\
356 - Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go.\\
357 - Eat our dust, you stupid dogs!\\
358 - Hal wins again!\\
359 - Well, they're not there.\\
360 - How can this be happening?\\
361 - Stevie never used to do things like this.\\
362 - He used to be such a good boy.\\
363 - He used to hold my yarn while I knitted.\\
364 - And I would hold his yarn while he knitted.\\
365 - He made this sweater.\\
366 - Kitty, I am so sorry.\\
367 - This is all my boys' fault.\\
368 - They turn everyone they come in contact with\\
369 - into scheming delinquents.\\
370 - They're like a virus.\\
371 - Oh, look, we don't blame your boys--\\
372 - well, we do--\\
373 - but the thing is, Stevie has had a hand in this.\\
374 - I mean, he's changed.\\
375 - Ever since he hit middle school,\\
376 - he's just snippy and secretive\\
377 - and just shuts himself up in his room.\\
378 - We should never have let him have that door.\\
379 - I guess we're in for a few rough months.\\
380 - Few  months?\\
381 - Well, when he gets older\\
382 - and realizes how much he's hurting us, then...\\
383 - Then he'll be even better at it.\\
384 - Let's face it.\\
385 - Teenagers are thoughtless, inconsiderate, eating machines\\
386 - dedicated to putting us through hell\\
387 - and sending us to an early grave.\\
388 - These kids just don't know how much we suffer.\\
389 - What's that buzzing sound?\\
390 - Oh, it's a massage feature.\\
391 - I'll turn it off.\\
392 - You kids didn't know who you were messing with.\\
393 - You caught a kid... in a wheelchair.\\
394 - Kudos.\\
395 - Shut up!\\
396 - You talk when I say.\\
397 - I'm shaking... in my chair.\\
398 - Don't go anywhere.\\
399 - I think we should run and jump the fence\\
400 - and get the cops.\\
401 - No, we should stay right here.\\
402 - This is good. This is smart.\\
403 - We're out in the open.\\
404 - We've got to move.\\
405 - No. This guy's a psychopath.\\
406 - He's probably got bodies buried all over the country.\\
407 - The fair comes to town, he kills a bunch of locals,\\
408 - then packs up and moves on to the next bunch of victims.\\
409 - Shut up-- we're going to be fine.\\
410 - Look, I just want to let you know\\
411 - I've always tried to be a good brother.\\
412 - If I ever hit you or broke your stuff,\\
413 - it was because you deserved it and it was fun,\\
414 - but that doesn't make it right.\\
415 - Reese, please stop talking like this.\\
416 - We're going to be fine.\\
417 - Take him!\\
418 - Hey, guys.\\
419 - Dewey, that's not funny.\\
420 - Where's Stevie?\\
421 - The guard grabbed him.\\
422 - Yeah, he locked him up in his trailer,\\
423 - and he's doing who knows what to him.\\
424 - Maybe my friends can help.\\
425 - What friends?\\
426 - We come in peace.\\
427 - Hello?\\
428 - Hey, it's me-- I talked to Richie.\\
429 - He has a couple ideas if you want to hear them.\\
430 - Roger that, Francis. Over.\\
431 - First off, he said the porno shop on Radford\\
432 - is having a parking lot sale.\\
433 - Oh, yeah, and the county fair is in town right now.\\
434 - All right.\\
435 - Of course, the fair.\\
436 - Your friends think they can hide, huh?\\
437 - I'll teach them a little lesson.\\
438 - They already know...\\
439 - how to make..\\
440 - six bucks... an hour.\\
441 - Shut up!\\
442 - Lothar, go.\\
443 - Phil, let's be reasonable about this.\\
444 - Why don't you let the little boy go?\\
445 - Get out of here, Gorak.\\
446 - You can't tell me what to do.\\
447 - I'm in charge of security.\\
448 - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\\
449 - I understand that,\\
450 - and you're doing a terrific job,\\
451 - but... I guess what I'm asking for here\\
452 - falls under the category of a favor.\\
453 - Can you do me a favor, Phil?\\
454 - Why should I do you a favor?\\
455 - You never do me any favors.\\
456 - Is this about the birthday party?\\
457 - No.\\
458 - Phil, I told you.\\
459 - I was trying to keep it small.\\
460 - If I invited you,\\
461 - I'd have to invite the concession people,\\
462 - the ticket takers, even the transportation guys.\\
463 - I can't afford that.\\
464 - It was nothing personal.\\
465 - Really?\\
466 - Look, we're having a poker game this weekend.\\
467 - Why don't you join us?\\
468 - Can I deal?\\
469 - Of course you can deal.\\
470 - Thanks for looking after our boys, Gorak.\\
471 - We hope they weren't too much of a bother.\\
472 - Hey, I know how kids can be.\\
473 - I got two little monsters of my own.\\
474 - And, Hal, don't forget,\\
475 - poker this weekend.\\
476 - Absolutely.\\
477 - Too bad the boys didn't get to see our show.\\
478 - Next time we're in town, we'll get them backstage.\\
479 - Only if you take me up on that home-cooked meal.\\
480 - You got it, Lois.\\
481 - These boys have had a rough night, so...\\
482 - take it easy on them?\\
483 - Right now all I'm worried about is getting them home.\\
484 - This sucks.\\
485 - This would've turned out perfect if Francis didn't rat us out.\\
486 - What are you smiling about?\\
487 - Gorak gave me one of his babies.
\subsection {Episode 24: Evacuation}
1 - Got the bricks?\\
2 - Whoa! Whee!\\
3 - Hang on, Dewey!\\
4 - Eight more seconds for the record!\\
5 - Whoa-ho! Yeah!\\
6 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
7 -     I don't know    \\
8 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     Life is unfair.    \\
18 - There we go.\\
19 - Oh, Hal,\\
20 - it's beautiful!\\
21 - You boys are not to sit on it, stand on it,\\
22 - jump on it, or go anywhere near it for the next year.\\
23 - Where's this coming from?\\
24 - Hey, Dewey,\\
25 - want to go with me to take\\
26 - the old couch to the dump?\\
27 - No, I want to watch cartoons.\\
28 - What, are you kidding?\\
29 - We're talking about the city dump.\\
30 - Mountains of smoldering garbage\\
31 - as far as you can see.\\
32 - Swarms of flies that block out the sun.\\
33 - Really?\\
34 - Mmm.\\
35 - Last time I was there,\\
36 - I saw a 40-pound seagull carry off\\
37 - a dog in its beak.\\
38 - Wow.\\
39 - Wow.\\
40 - Come on!\\
41 - Hey, guys.\\
42 - Sorry I'm late.\\
43 - Stevie and I finished our geometry unit.\\
44 - We're two weeks ahead.\\
45 - Congratulations, you're grounded.\\
46 - What?\\
47 - You're an hour and a half late.\\
48 - You promised you'd be back at 3:00 to help with the couch.\\
49 - Your father and Reese nearly killed themselves.\\
50 - Yeah, but... No buts!\\
51 - You're grounded.\\
52 - Two weeks in your room, no TV, no friends, no phone.\\
53 - But I was doing homework.\\
54 - I thought it'd be okay.\\
55 - You're not allowed to decide what's okay.\\
56 - Not yet.\\
57 - You looked me in the eye and you promised.\\
58 - You're grounded.\\
59 - This is totally unfair!\\
60 - Oh!\\
61 - Okay, when did I sit in tar?\\
62 -     When we get to the garbage dump    \\
63 -     This is what we'll see    \\
64 -     Five broken toilets    \\
65 -     Four fuzzy cheese wheels    \\
66 -     Three tons of maggots         Two gigantic rats    \\
67 -     And a stench that will buckle your knees.    \\
68 - Yahoo!\\
69 - Uh, excuse me.\\
70 - Can you tell us where we should dump this couch?\\
71 - Oh!\\
72 - Oh, for the love of...\\
73 - We didn't even get to see it land.\\
74 - Well, son,\\
75 - I guess our work here is done.\\
76 - You are so dead.\\
77 - Francis, you know I couldn't go out with Laura unless\\
78 - I found somebody for her sister.\\
79 - Now, you're here so just try to enjoy your date.\\
80 - She's 12.\\
81 - Hey, you guys want tattoos?\\
82 - So she's not the one.\\
83 - You can still have a good time.\\
84 - How could you do this to me?\\
85 - Come on.\\
86 - You've done way worse to me.\\
87 - You totally deserve this.\\
88 - Based on what?\\
89 - Will you Jethros just shut up!?\\
90 - Nobody cares how many bales of hay you can lift!\\
91 - So, now we know-- pigs can swim, cows can't.\\
92 - This is ridiculous.\\
93 - When did the word "Fascist" become such a hot button?\\
94 - I have been nothing but a good friend to you.\\
95 - Look, Francis, I'm not going to argue.\\
96 - You'll do this or I'll punch your face\\
97 - through the back of your head.\\
98 - See, every time I trump you with logic,\\
99 - you resort to violence.\\
100 - I just want that on the record.\\
101 - Mmm, ice cream.\\
102 - What a wonderful, unexpected treat for some of us.\\
103 - Yes, Reese, you get to eat ice cream\\
104 - and I don't.\\
105 - Thank you for subtly illustrating that point.\\
106 - I'll get it.\\
107 - Mmm, sprinkles.\\
108 - Aren't those your favorite, Malcolm?\\
109 - I'm rubbing my butt on your pillowcase.\\
110 - Oh, boy, Reese, what'd you do?!\\
111 - Sir, we have to evacuate\\
112 - the entire neighborhood.\\
113 - I need you to leave your house immediately.\\
114 - What... evacuating? Why?\\
115 - There's been a toxic chemical spill\\
116 - about a mile away-- a train derailed.\\
117 - How'd that happen?\\
118 - Some idiot left a couch on the railroad tracks.\\
119 - I wonder if that was...\\
120 - Careful, son.\\
121 - Don't want to drip.\\
122 - - I - repeat, if you're not in need\\
123 - of immediate first aid, find an available cot,\\
124 - remain calm and wait for further instructions.\\
125 - Will you look at this?\\
126 - I hope they find whoever's responsible\\
127 - and string him up by his thumbs.\\
128 - Hey, uh, fella, don't you think\\
129 - you're overreacting?\\
130 - I mean, my family\\
131 - is exposed to dangerous chemicals all the time.\\
132 - In-in fact, I-I remember\\
133 - I accidentally set off a flea bomb in the boys' room\\
134 - when my son, Dewey, was in there taking a nap.\\
135 - I can smell colors.\\
136 - Sir, I've got two overturned tankers\\
137 - out there spewing out\\
138 - a cloud of sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide.\\
139 - That can scar your throat and lungs\\
140 - in a matter of seconds.\\
141 - But it's not necessarily fatal.\\
142 - I-I mean, maybe you'd need an artificial larynx,\\
143 - but you'd still be alive.\\
144 - That'd be so cool.\\
145 - My name is Reese.\\
146 - What are you looking at?\\
147 - Son, please.\\
148 - Has anyone died yet?\\
149 - Not that I'm aware of.\\
150 - Well, what if the wind shifts?\\
151 - Is the water supply going to be contaminated?\\
152 - What about the food?\\
153 - What about the medical personnel?\\
154 - How can be sure that all these people are going to be safe?\\
155 - I'm sorry, I really don't know all of the answers.\\
156 - I'm just a high school senior.\\
157 - Are we going to order at some point tonight?\\
158 - Hang on, this is important.\\
159 - This is the only booth she hasn't\\
160 - been felt up in.\\
161 - Have another doughnut, lonely girl.\\
162 - So, you like school?\\
163 - You're blocking my light!\\
164 - Check it out.\\
165 - Some idiot left the storage closet unlocked.\\
166 - I've got every Dixie Cup in the place.\\
167 - What are you doing with those?\\
168 - Building a future, my friend.\\
169 - I can't believe this place.\\
170 - This cot smells like feet.\\
171 - All right, we're just\\
172 - going to have to make the best of things.\\
173 - Where do you think you're going?\\
174 - I'm just going to look around.\\
175 - You are not going anywhere.\\
176 - You're still grounded. What? Here?\\
177 - That's right. Look around-- we're living in a gym!\\
178 - That doesn't change what you did.\\
179 - Mom, we can all die.\\
180 - If that happens, you're off the hook.\\
181 - Until then, I want those buns on that cot.\\
182 - Now.\\
183 - Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.\\
184 - Listen, I-I was just wondering if\\
185 - there was something that I could do to help.\\
186 - Not that there's any real reason, of course.\\
187 - I'm just... looking to do my part.\\
188 - I think we got it pretty well covered, sir.\\
189 - No, no, there must be something.\\
190 - I don't care if it's, if it's messy or trivial\\
191 - or even life-threatening...\\
192 - Sir, I'd appreciate it\\
193 - if you'd just return to your area.\\
194 - Please, you have to find\\
195 - some way for me to be useful.\\
196 - I have got to ease these people's suffering.\\
197 - They have got to know that I am here for them.\\
198 - Is that pepper spray?\\
199 - I also have a whistle\\
200 - and I'm prepared to use that as well.\\
201 - You know, I'd be happy to give you some\\
202 - but you should ask your parents first.\\
203 - I can't.\\
204 - They're dead.\\
205 - What?\\
206 - They were killed by the cloud.\\
207 - Can I have some?\\
208 - Oh, my God, you poor thing.\\
209 - They were choking.\\
210 - It was awful.\\
211 - Can I have the one with nuts?\\
212 - Oh, of course, dear.\\
213 - Toxic chemical spill has been reported in the area...\\
214 - Where'd they go?\\
215 - Don't worry, they'll be back in a few hours.\\
216 - They took the car?!\\
217 - Hey, you're the one who went to the bathroom.\\
218 - You gave them the opening.\\
219 - All right, that's it.\\
220 - Come on, get your books.\\
221 - We're getting out of here.\\
222 - No, I want to eat.\\
223 - No, we're going.\\
224 - I'm not leaving till I eat!\\
225 - Would you keep it down, please?\\
226 - You were a lot nicer when we were on the Internet.\\
227 - Look, you can't pull this crap with me.\\
228 - I have three little brothers.\\
229 - I know every manipulation in the book.\\
230 - So get your butt in gear.\\
231 - No, if I go home now, Laura'll get busted.\\
232 - We're supposed to be at the mall.\\
233 - What do you care?\\
234 - Let me tell you about your sister.\\
235 - She doesn't like you at all.\\
236 - She treats you like dirt.\\
237 - Well... she does.\\
238 - It's not your fault.\\
239 - I mean, you don't deserve that.\\
240 - No one deserves that.\\
241 - She's the one with the problem.\\
242 - Really, I'm sure you have a lot of nice qualities\\
243 - that people don't even...\\
244 - Waitress! Can we get some service over here?\\
245 - Yes?\\
246 - I want the burger plate,\\
247 - extra fries and a chocolate malt.\\
248 - ...and then they were trapped in the car\\
249 - and they told me to get help and I ran\\
250 - and I ran,\\
251 - then I fell down and when I woke up,\\
252 - the ambulance man was holding me.\\
253 - And your parents were...\\
254 - Ooh, you poor little boy.\\
255 - That looks like fun.\\
256 - What is wrong with you?\\
257 - Give that to him!\\
258 - What can I say?\\
259 - We're all trying to get through as best we can.\\
260 - Thank you.\\
261 - And of course, in these disasters,\\
262 - it's always the children who suffer the most.\\
263 - No, no, no!\\
264 - You're not talking to him. He's grounded.\\
265 - Looks like you need a cup, friend.\\
266 - Ah, that'd be great, thanks.\\
267 - I wish it were that simple.\\
268 - What are you talking about? I'm thirsty.\\
269 - Is that your truck out there with the canned fruit?\\
270 - Yeah, why?\\
271 - Let's take a walk.\\
272 - There!\\
273 - That should take care of that wobble, huh?\\
274 - Listen, is it too drafty here?\\
275 - Should we move you away from the window?\\
276 - No, no, we're fine.\\
277 - Thanks for the help.\\
278 - Well, that's what this is all about, huh?\\
279 - Helping each other out.\\
280 - This is the kind of thing that we should be focusing on.\\
281 - Not a witch hunt,\\
282 - pointing fingers... blame, blame!\\
283 - We are bigger than that,\\
284 - aren't we, honey?\\
285 - Who wants a bedtime story?\\
286 - Can't you make him go away, Daddy?\\
287 - She is precious.\\
288 - Okay.\\
289 - Excuse me, did you find the boy whose parents were killed?\\
290 - Not yet.\\
291 - Excuse me.\\
292 - Did you say, "killed"?\\
293 - Yes, they were killed by the gas cloud.\\
294 - Oh, my God.\\
295 - The boy's mother saved him with her very last breath.\\
296 - And then the poor boy had to strangle his own dog\\
297 - just to stop its suffering.\\
298 - And on his birthday!\\
299 - Yes?\\
300 - I want a piece of apple pie a la mode,\\
301 - some chocolate cake and a banana split.\\
302 - Sure thing. Why don't you save me some money\\
303 - and just yell at your sister\\
304 - instead of burying your anger in a mountain of French fries?\\
305 - Are you calling me fat?\\
306 - What? No, I'm not calling you fat.\\
307 - So now I'm a liar?\\
308 - No, you're twisting around everything I say.\\
309 - Why do you do that?\\
310 - You hurt my feelings.\\
311 - Okay, would you just keep it down, please?\\
312 - I'm sorry.\\
313 - Why do you touch your hair so much?\\
314 - I don't touch my hair that much.\\
315 - Why is everyone so fixated on my hair?\\
316 - I'm sick of it.\\
317 - Okay, okay, relax.\\
318 - I... I just... I don't want to talk about it.\\
319 - It's just that people make fun of me.\\
320 - The guys at school call me "Poodlehead."\\
321 - That is so cruel.\\
322 - I mean, I can see it, but still...\\
323 - I got to tell you, Malcolm,\\
324 - sometimes, I'm so good, it's scary.\\
325 - What are you doing with toilet paper?\\
326 - I got my hands on some canned fruit.\\
327 - I traded those for batteries, the batteries for DVDs.\\
328 - And I swapped those with the janitor\\
329 - for the school's entire supply of toilet paper.\\
330 - Once the specially "seasoned"\\
331 - meat loaf works its magic,\\
332 - I can name my price.\\
333 - You know, that's not only unbelievably evil\\
334 - but you actually put some thought and effort into it.\\
335 - I'm impressed.\\
336 - I don't know what it is.\\
337 - I guess when people are miserable and suffering,\\
338 - it brings out the best in me.\\
339 - Thanks for noticing.\\
340 - Hi, guys.\\
341 - Hey, Dabney, did you bring your Palm Pilot?\\
342 - Yeah. Good to know.\\
343 - Hey, Malcolm, isn't this great?\\
344 - I wouldn't know.\\
345 - Come on, we get to hang out in the gym...\\
346 - without worrying about dodgeballs, or getting pantsed.\\
347 - It's a dream come true.\\
348 - We actually get to live in the school.\\
349 - Check this out!\\
350 - It's the key to the girls' locker room.\\
351 - We were actually standing\\
352 - where girls take showers... naked.\\
353 - Or so I'm told.\\
354 - Malcolm.\\
355 - No visitors.\\
356 - Malcolm's grounded.\\
357 - You shouldn't be talking to him.\\
358 - Everyone, this is my son.\\
359 - He's being punished.\\
360 - No one should talk to him.\\
361 - Mom, for God's sakes, they just came over\\
362 - to say hi.\\
363 - I took the key to the girls' locker room.\\
364 - Please, don't tell our mothers.\\
365 - I'm so ashamed.\\
366 - What?\\
367 - You did that just to humiliate me.\\
368 - Is that what you think? Yes.\\
369 - It was completely unjustified.\\
370 - And I want you to know, I am never going to forget this.\\
371 - Well, good.\\
372 - It'll be the first time in ten years\\
373 - the punishment's actually stuck.\\
374 - People, please, the money we raise\\
375 - cannot bring back his parents but we must do something.\\
376 - We're his only family now.\\
377 - Hasn't that poor, little boy suffered enough\\
378 - from the train wreck?\\
379 - Which, by the way is a surprisingly common occurrence\\
380 - when looked at in a nationwide context.\\
381 - Please, we've got to give till it hurts.\\
382 - I'm just saying, it might be hard to get my hands\\
383 - on five blankets.\\
384 - Look, I need them. My family's freezing.\\
385 - A lot of people are cold.\\
386 - It's a real problem. How about the watch?\\
387 - The guy before me only had to give you his socks.\\
388 - It's a cold world. It's getting colder by the minute.\\
389 - You're an evil, little punk.\\
390 - Uh-uh.\\
391 - Socks, too.\\
392 - And then Dave told me they were just studying.\\
393 - But they were totally having a pizza party.\\
394 - You're kidding?\\
395 - They came to my room and asked for napkins.\\
396 - It's not like I could tell them how hurt I was, 'cause you\\
397 - constantly got to keep up this front of being the tough guy.\\
398 - They have no idea who I really am.\\
399 - If they knew I kept a dream journal...\\
400 - You do?\\
401 - I think that's so cool.\\
402 - Really?\\
403 - I do, too.\\
404 - I'll tell you one thing, if those guys ever\\
405 - got a hold of that, I'd never hear the end of it.\\
406 - So? You don't have to care what they think.\\
407 - I don't. Well, what about your sister?\\
408 - She's an idiot.\\
409 - Hey, good for you.\\
410 - Anyway, people around here are freaks.\\
411 - Some nights, I lock myself in my room and spin my globe.\\
412 - And wherever I point my finger,\\
413 - I just pretend that's where I really live.\\
414 - I do that, too. Really?\\
415 - And you'll feel the cold worse than anyone.\\
416 - Because, let's face it,\\
417 - your circulation isn't that good to begin with.\\
418 - I already gave you money.\\
419 - And you're satisfied. I see.\\
420 - That little boy doesn't need clothes or an education.\\
421 - Let's just put him to work in the mines\\
422 - like they did when you were a girl.\\
423 - I'm on a fixed income.\\
424 - So, what are you trying to do?\\
425 - Take it to the grave with you?\\
426 - Should we get you a casket with saddlebags?\\
427 - Give me my shoe.\\
428 - It's right here. Come and get it.\\
429 - What's the matter?\\
430 - Was somebody a bad boy?\\
431 - Does the bad boy want\\
432 - his shoe back?\\
433 - Malcolm!\\
434 - Get back on the cot.\\
435 - This kid's got my shoe.\\
436 - Get back on the cot.\\
437 - I'll take care of this.\\
438 - Is Mommy going to\\
439 - take care of it for you?\\
440 - Malcolm, get back on that cot.\\
441 - No.\\
442 - Excuse me?\\
443 - I've had it. I quit.\\
444 - What do you mean, you quit?\\
445 - I quit this stupid system.\\
446 - The only reason I'm being punished like this\\
447 - is because I agreed to be punished like this.\\
448 - And I'm not going to\\
449 - agree anymore.\\
450 - This isn't parenting. This is just sadism.\\
451 - Oh, you think I enjoy this? Yes, I do.\\
452 - And I am way too old for this.\\
453 - We are going to find some other way\\
454 - of dealing with each other.\\
455 - We are going to change the rules.\\
456 - What were you planning to do?\\
457 - Take away my TV when I'm married?\\
458 - Give me a time-out when I'm 30?\\
459 - What? Am I supposed to be scared?\\
460 - What are you going to do, spank me?\\
461 - Okay.\\
462 - Mom, what are you doing?\\
463 - Mom, cut it out.\\
464 - I don't know what you think you're doing.\\
465 - How did she get so strong?\\
466 - When I can't do this, we'll change the rules.\\
467 - Five hundred\\
468 - and sixty-three dollars?\\
469 - Come on, people.\\
470 - What if he needs braces? What if he has scoliosis?\\
471 - Huh?\\
472 - Okay, fine.\\
473 - I'll just say, "Sorry, little crooked boy.\\
474 - "You can always get a job in the circus...\\
475 - "while the rest of us drive our Porsches\\
476 - and eat our T-bone steaks."\\
477 - Dad, can we go home now?\\
478 - My stomach hurts. Not now, son.\\
479 - That your kid?\\
480 - Yes, why?\\
481 - This guy has been\\
482 - collecting money for his own kid.\\
483 - What?\\
484 - Dewey, did you tell these people...?\\
485 - What the hell you trying to pull here, mister?\\
486 - He's been yanking our chain!\\
487 - No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
488 - I swear, I didn't know anything about this.\\
489 - And if he lied to you, well, I can assure you\\
490 - that is not the kind of behavior I allow in my family.\\
491 - Ow, ow, ow...\\
492 - Is this your son?\\
493 - Reese?\\
494 - He was running a black market.\\
495 - He had two diabetics bidding against each other for insulin.\\
496 - That is a lie.\\
497 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, now, now, wait just a second.\\
498 - I know how this must look.\\
499 - But if you just give me the chance\\
500 - to get to the bottom of this,\\
501 - I swear to you, I will make this right.\\
502 - Come over here.\\
503 - You boys have both behaved very badly.\\
504 - So, you are both going to apologize\\
505 - to these nice, generous people\\
506 - like you have never apologized before.\\
507 - Do you hear me?\\
508 - Okay.\\
509 - Dewey, come on.\\
510 - Go ahead.\\
511 - Nice and loud.\\
512 - We're sorry we left the couch on the tracks\\
513 - and wrecked the train.\\
514 - Reese, run, run.\\
515 - Hey, stop him.\\
516 - Well, this is it.\\
517 - Maybe I'll call you sometime.\\
518 - Whatever.\\
519 - Hey, I, uh...\\
520 - I actually had a good time.\\
521 - Me, too.\\
522 - You're, like, a really good girlfriend.\\
523 - Thanks.\\
524 - Hey, sorry about tonight.\\
525 - Yeah, well, your plan to palm me off on a 12- year-old backfired,\\
526 - 'cause I actually had a really good time.\\
527 - Well, good for you, Poodlehead.\\
528 - You know what?\\
529 - I don't care about your childish taunts anymore.\\
530 - You can call me anything you like.\\
531 - I think I'll stick with Poodlehead.\\
532 - Fine.\\
533 - I'm glad it doesn't bother you when I call you "Poodlehead,"\\
534 - Poodlehead.\\
535 - I got to tell you, Poodlehead...\\
536 - Shut up!\\
537 - Do not set foot outside this area.\\
538 - Not one foot.\\
539 - I would just like to get one thing clear.\\
540 - When we go home, you fellas are still going to be\\
541 - a presence in the community, right?\\
542 - If I wasn't in uniform, I'd take a swing at you, myself.\\
543 - Fair enough.\\
544 - Are you telling me\\
545 - that I can't discipline my own child?\\
546 - Lady, we got a lot of angry people in there.\\
547 - I think it's best you stay out here with the other troublemakers.\\
548 - They'd like us to stay inside the box.\\
549 - This is outrageous.\\
550 - We're going to freeze to death out here.\\
551 - What did  we  do?\\
552 - Maybe Malcolm can bring us a couple blankets.\\
553 - Come on.\\
554 - Malcolm.\\
555 - Can you get us some blankets?\\
556 - Help us out here.\\
557 - It's cold out here.\\
558 - I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to leave my cot.\\
559 - Don't think you won't suffer the consequences later, mister.

1 - Come on!\\
2 - You said I could play.\\
3 - You have to go down there again.\\

16 - Then it was just sad.\\
17 - It's not fair!\\
18 - It's my turn!\\
19 - Now it's funny again.\\
20 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
21 -     I don't know    \\
22 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     And you're not so big    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     And you're not so big    \\
31 -     Life is unfair.    \\
32 - Dad, Francis has to go back to school tomorrow.\\
33 - Can't we at least watch what he wants?\\
34 - This is educational.\\
35 - It's a celebration of the human spirit.\\
36 - It shows we can always find\\
37 - a way to persevere\\
38 - no matter how many times we're defeated.\\
39 - No, don't put on the rocket skates.\\
40 - Hal, can I see you in the bedroom?\\
41 - Yeah, yeah, just a second, honey, the coyote...\\
42 - Hal.\\
43 - All right, who did what now?\\
44 - You did. I'm two weeks late.\\
45 - What?\\
46 - No. Yes.\\
47 - Wait... no. No, you can't be.\\
48 - You can't be.\\
49 - We've been very careful.\\
50 - How can you let this happen?\\
51 - How could I let this happen?!\\
52 - You're kidding, right?\\
53 - I'm just saying, you're the woman.\\
54 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
55 - You know that I can't be trusted with these things.\\
56 - I mean, you're the gatekeeper!\\
57 - That is the stupidest thing you have ever said!\\
58 - Not even close!\\
59 - How long does it take to get me a soda, Dewey?\\
60 - Mom and Dad are fighting.\\
61 - Really?\\
62 - Well, don't worry, chief.\\
63 - Everything will be fine.\\
64 - Trust me.\\
65 - You know what will take your mind off it?\\
66 - Making me a sandwich.\\
67 - I'm sorry. It's just that this is upsetting.\\
68 - Well, it's upsetting for me, too.\\
69 - You cannot be pregnant.\\
70 - We're not ready for this.\\
71 - When have we ever been ready for this, Hal?\\
72 - Okay, go ahead.\\
73 - The blessed state of matrimony\\
74 - is a sacred place...\\
75 - Oh, God!\\
76 - Maybe we should get you to the hospital.\\
77 - No! I will not have our baby born out of wedlock!\\
78 - I don't understand why all of a sudden\\
79 - you're so hung up on this.\\
80 - Up until last week\\
81 - a marriage certificate was just a piece of paper.\\
82 - I changed my mind!\\
83 - And it made me the happiest man in the world.\\
84 - Welcome home, Francis.\\
85 - Yeah.\\
86 - This place is beautiful.\\
87 - Oh, thanks.\\
88 - I can't take any credit for it.\\
89 - The decorator did everything.\\
90 - Let's see...\\
91 - Oh, look, just keep the change.\\
92 - One second.\\
93 - One second.\\
94 - I forgot something.\\
95 - I am so rattled.\\
96 - There...\\
97 - Have a cigar. It's Cuban.\\
98 - Thanks. You're welcome.\\
99 - Wow!\\
100 - Hey, Mommy.\\
101 - Hal, we have a baby.\\
102 - Yes, we do.\\
103 - The baby.\\
104 - Fragile...\\
105 - helpless...\\
106 - little baby.\\
107 - He's beautiful.\\
108 - Oh, we're so lucky, aren't we, Hal?\\
109 - Huh? Yeah. Lucky.\\
110 - You think we're going to be good parents?\\
111 - You kidding? The best.\\
112 - Do you think it's going to change our relationship?\\
113 - Our what?\\
114 - No. No.\\
115 - 'Cause we get along so well now,\\
116 - and everybody says a baby really changes things.\\
117 - Oh, I better feed him.\\
118 - Why?\\
119 - Frankly, I think he's getting kind of fat.\\
120 - Hal, the nurse said I should feed him every four hours.\\
121 - Yeah, well, did you get a look at the nurse?\\
122 - Hal, where is the baby?\\
123 - I don't know how to say this exactly,\\
124 - but I think the baby's...\\
125 - ...in the closet!\\
126 - Whoo!\\
127 - Here he is.\\
128 - Perfectly safe.\\
129 - You put the baby in the closet?\\
130 - You left the milk out on the counter.\\
131 - Come here, Francis.\\
132 - I'm never going to let you out of my sight again.\\
133 - Hey, Mom, is it okay if I have the...?\\
134 - Go away!\\
135 - All I'm saying is that you were the one\\
136 - who wore those jeans with that rip above the knee.\\
137 - Hal, if I got rid of everything that made you hot and bothered,\\
138 - I'd be running around with a handkerchief\\
139 - and a baseball cap. Stop it.\\
140 - What do you want from me?!\\
141 - I'm only human.\\
142 - Oh, please. The minute you cross that threshold\\
143 - into the bedroom, you become more beast than man.\\
144 - Fine, everything is my fault!\\
145 - Oh, great. Here come the waterworks.\\
146 - Stupid bug.\\
147 - What's wrong with Mom and Dad?\\
148 - Aw, just wait.\\
149 - In an hour they'll be all lovey-dovey.\\
150 - It's disgusting.\\
151 - Stupid bug.\\
152 - Ow!\\
153 - You stupid...\\
154 - Ow! Ow!\\
155 - Ow! Ow!\\
156 - God, Reese, give it a rest.\\
157 - Okay, Francis is down for his nap.\\
158 - I emptied the dishwasher,\\
159 - put another load in the laundry.\\
160 - Didn't have time to scrape the pudding\\
161 - out of your hair dryer.\\
162 - Maybe tomorrow.\\
163 - Bye.\\
164 - When will you be home?\\
165 - I don't know-- 5:00, 6:00... 9:00...\\
166 - Did you say 9:00?\\
167 - Honey, I canceled another appointment\\
168 - to come home for lunch.\\
169 - I have to get caught up.\\
170 - Hal, this is ridiculous.\\
171 - You're working 14-hour days.\\
172 - This baby's trying to beat me to death from the inside\\
173 - and Francis is out of control.\\
174 - Something has got to change.\\
175 - Okay, I'll talk to my boss.\\
176 - Yeah, you said that before.\\
177 - Well, yes, and then the Collins account\\
178 - was dumped into my lap.\\
179 - It wasn't a good time.\\
180 - Now is better.\\
181 - Okay?\\
182 - Love you.\\
183 - Marty, I have been the leader in sales\\
184 - for this company for five years running.\\
185 - No one has ever done that before.\\
186 - And all I'm asking\\
187 - is to cut back on my hours just a little tiny bit\\
188 - so I can help out at home.\\
189 - You have kids. You know how it is.\\
190 - Absolutely, Hal.\\
191 - Don't worry, we'll find a way to make this work.\\
192 - Hey, Hal.\\
193 - Hey, Phil.\\
194 - Hal... and Supplies.\\
195 - What?\\
196 - I trained that guy.\\
197 - I gave him half the names in his Rolodex.\\
198 - And you know what he said to me this morning?\\
199 - "We need more toner."\\
200 - And he didn't even need toner!\\
201 - Ow!\\
202 - Another contraction?\\
203 - No! He's kicking me in between contractions.\\
204 - What the hell is with this kid?\\
205 - Well, are we\\
206 - having fun yet?\\
207 - Okay, let's take a look in the oven.\\
208 - Ow!\\
209 - God!\\
210 - How far along am I?\\
211 - 'Cause I swear to God, he's biting my kidney.\\
212 - You're only two centimeters dilated.\\
213 - I think you've got four or five hours at least.\\
214 - No.\\
215 - Honey, the doctor... No! He is coming out now!\\
216 - I have had it with this!\\
217 - You are coming out right now, mister!\\
218 - Ah, ah, ah, what are you doing?\\
219 - It's not time to push.\\
220 - You're just going to prolong your labor.\\
221 - Oh, great. Make it a challenge.\\
222 - Lady, you're just going to tire yourself out,\\
223 - and when it comes time to really push,\\
224 - you're going to be exhausted.\\
225 - Look, all I'm saying is, she can try to force this all she wants.\\
226 - It's just not going to...\\
227 - Oh, my God! Nurse!\\
228 - Okay, honey, you're doing great, you're doing great.\\
229 - Just remember to breathe.\\
230 - Hal... God, do you think we're really ready\\
231 - for a second baby?\\
232 - We're going to have twice as many kids\\
233 - and half the money.\\
234 - What's it going to do to us?\\
235 - We-We'll, we'll find a way.\\
236 - You know, we love each other.\\
237 - We-We'll adjust.\\
238 - We'll make it work.\\
239 - I mean, they're just kids.\\
240 - Here he comes.\\
241 - Ow!\\
242 - My God, he kicked me in the nose.\\
243 - We'll be fine.\\
244 - What took you so long?\\
245 - I couldn't very well go to the Lucky Aide\\
246 - where you work, now, could I?\\
247 - Oh, what, so you drove clear across town?\\
248 - Yes, you want to go over the route I took\\
249 - so you can criticize that, too?\\
250 - Damn. Who's in there?\\
251 - I'm busy.\\
252 - Backyard.\\
253 - Are you out of your mind?\\
254 - Let's go-- I'll let you choose the most direct route.\\
255 - Are Mom and Dad getting a divorce?\\
256 - What are you talking about?\\
257 - They're really mad at each other.\\
258 - Don't worry about it.\\
259 - Everything will be fine.\\
260 - How do you know?\\
261 - Look, it used to scare me, too\\
262 - but they just have a way of working things out.\\
263 - How?\\
264 - I don't know, they just do.\\
265 - But how?\\
266 - How do I say this so you'll understand?\\
267 - Shut up.\\
268 - Ha, ha!\\
269 - Does Reese want the bear?\\
270 - Reese wants the bear, Reese wants the bear.\\
271 - This place is so much smaller than the apartment.\\
272 - So you keep reminding me.\\
273 - What choice do we have, Lois?\\
274 - Yes, it is smaller.\\
275 - And cheaper.\\
276 - That apartment was no place to raise children.\\
277 - There was nothing there but museums\\
278 - and nightclubs and trendy restaurants...\\
279 - Well, at least we'll have\\
280 - a yard to putter around in, huh?\\
281 - I can't wait to get my hands on this lawn!\\
282 - Ow!\\
283 - Oh, okay, okay, boys, enough playing.\\
284 - It's time for Reese's lessons.\\
285 - What'll it be today, son, huh?\\
286 - Russian literature?\\
287 - Or should we brush up on the circulatory system, hmm?\\
288 - Circulatory system it is.\\
289 - Yeah, great.\\
290 - Just ignore the eight months pregnant woman\\
291 - carrying the boxes.\\
292 -     Art! Mona Lisa was by da Vinci    \\
293 -     Science! The radio was built by Marconi    \\
294 -     Math!    \\
295 -     Nine is the product of three times three    \\
296 -     Natural History! Darwin said we all come from monkeys    \\
297 -     But not    \\
298 -     Literally.    \\
299 - Hal, will you stop it!\\
300 - Lois, we have got to do this\\
301 - 35 minutes, three times a day.\\
302 - All Reese does is sit there.\\
303 - He's a thinker, Lois.\\
304 - He's an intensely focused, peerless thinker.\\
305 - He's absorbing information.\\
306 - Studies show that developing young minds\\
307 - absorb information at a phenomenal rate.\\
308 - Hal, he's two years old.\\
309 - He calls you "phone."\\
310 - I don't know who you think this\\
311 - is helping, but it's not Reese.\\
312 - Oh, my God, he just hit my trigeminal nerve!\\
313 - We've been working on the nervous system all morning.\\
314 - Oh, Hal, will you come down to reality\\
315 - long enough to help me unpack?\\
316 - Lois, did it ever\\
317 - cross your mind that it might be nice\\
318 - to support what I am doing here?\\
319 - You know, that's a good question.\\
320 - What are you doing here?\\
321 - Because I'll tell you what you're not doing,\\
322 - and that's helping!\\
323 - You know, I think...\\
324 - ...that I should go for a drive\\
325 - before I say something I'll regret.\\
326 - Phone go bye-bye!\\
327 - Oh, honey...\\
328 - Oh, sweetheart, it's okay.\\
329 - Mommy and Daddy are just having a tough time.\\
330 - For the last few months.\\
331 - But don't worry... Ow!\\
332 - Oh, oh...\\
333 - Oh, oh, no.\\
334 - Oh, no, not now.\\
335 - Hal!\\
336 - Okay, we're going on a little drive,\\
337 - and Daddy will figure out where we are eventually,\\
338 - and we'll all be together at the hospital.\\
339 - I don't need to go to the hospital.\\
340 - No, honey, it's for me.\\
341 - You're lying. You want to give me a shot.\\
342 - No, honey, that was last time, and I already apologized.\\
343 - Now get in the car!\\
344 -     Mommy's a liar    \\
345 -     Mommy's a liar.    \\
346 - Francis, unlock the door.\\
347 - Ha, ha!\\
348 - Unlock the door right now.\\
349 - You're a liar!\\
350 - You stay out!\\
351 - Francis, please.\\
352 - Mommy has to go to the hospital.\\
353 - Say you're sorry!\\
354 - Open the door!\\
355 - Say you're poopy!\\
356 - I will not say I'm poopy!\\
357 - Open that door!\\
358 - I'm having a baby!\\
359 - Congratulations!\\
360 - What's going on?\\
361 - Your wife just gave birth on your front lawn.\\
362 - Congratulations, I guess.\\
363 - Oh, my Lord!\\
364 - Want the rest of my Slurpee?\\
365 - Leave me alone, Hal.\\
366 - Need any help?\\
367 - Leave me alone, Hal.\\
368 - Take this.\\
369 - Couldn't spring for the one-minute test.\\
370 - This one takes five.\\
371 - Four more minutes we get to spend together, dear.\\
372 - Don't take that tone with me.\\
373 - I'm sorry, this is the only tone I have.\\
374 - It's my "I'm panicking about our future" tone.\\
375 - How can we afford this?\\
376 - Have you even thought about that?\\
377 - No, I've just been enjoying peeing in the yard so much,\\
378 - I haven't thought about anything!\\
379 - Another snappy comeback!\\
380 - That's very helpful!\\
381 - I'm not being helpful?!\\
382 - Let me give it to you straight, Hal!\\
383 - Why don't you take that stick\\
384 - and shove it up your...\\
385 - Reese, Reese, please just sit here\\
386 - for five minutes, please, I'm begging you.\\
387 - Play with this.\\
388 - Malcolm, would you please pick up your stuff?\\
389 - And what is a four-year-old\\
390 - playing with a microscope for, anyway?\\
391 - I see you still haven't moved the microwave.\\
392 - As I have pointed out to you several times,\\
393 - this is the only socket in the kitchen that works.\\
394 - Perhaps we could afford\\
395 - the extravagance of an extension cord!\\
396 - We have extension cords,\\
397 - but they're all being used right now\\
398 - to power the space heater in the bedroom\\
399 - because somebody gets chills.\\
400 - Well, perhaps you'd like to share your bed\\
401 - with someone who doesn't get chills.\\
402 - Hi, Lois.\\
403 - What did he do this time?\\
404 - He took a joyride in a street cleaner.\\
405 - Get in here. Francis.\\
406 - Here's the summons.\\
407 - Your juvenile court date's on the 12th,\\
408 - and, well, you know the drill.\\
409 - Thank you, Officer.\\
410 - They caught you\\
411 - on a street cleaner?\\
412 - What were you thinking?\\
413 - That it went faster.\\
414 - Go to your room.\\
415 - Are you happy now?\\
416 - Me? How is this my fault?\\
417 - You are always regaling him\\
418 - with tales of your wild youth.\\
419 - Those are cautionary tales.\\
420 - Cautionary tales do not end with\\
421 - "It was so cool." Mom,\\
422 - I think I broke my chemistry set.\\
423 - In a second, Malcolm.\\
424 - All right, do me a favor, Lois.\\
425 - Make me a list of pre-approved childhood memories\\
426 - so I know what I can and what I can't\\
427 - share with the boys.\\
428 - Oh, for God's sake, hold still.\\
429 - Hal, that's not going to work.\\
430 - Just drive him to the emergency room.\\
431 - We do not need to go to the emergency room. Ah.\\
432 - Mom! Hal, you're forcing it\\
433 - further in his mouth, and he's going to choke to death!\\
434 - For once will you stop\\
435 - telling me how wrong I am?\\
436 - And will you stop telling me what to do?\\
437 - What the...\\
438 - I tried to make invisible ink,\\
439 - but I think I made chlorine gas.\\
440 - Come on, everybody out!\\
441 - Out, out, out, out, now, come on, out!\\
442 - Go!\\
443 - Okay, we all here?\\
444 - Okay, good. We're fine.\\
445 - We'll just let the house air out, and...\\
446 - Rain, yay! Yay!\\
447 - Okay, let's hear it!\\
448 - This has got to be my fault somehow.\\
449 - So go ahead.\\
450 - Say it, come on!\\
451 - I'm the cause of all that is bad in the universe!\\
452 - Everything that I touch turns to crap!\\
453 - And now I bring you rain!\\
454 - Oh, you'll feel better\\
455 - once you get it out in the open, Lois!\\
456 - Come on!\\
457 - I'm having the baby.\\
458 - Oh, well, that's good\\
459 - because the car keys are inside the house.\\
460 - So, I can either suffocate\\
461 - by going back in there to get them\\
462 - or you can have another baby out here on the lawn!\\
463 - Try the azaleas!\\
464 - Maybe they'll finally bloom!\\
465 - We can't do this!\\
466 - We are not having a baby with us like this.\\
467 - We have to figure out a way to fix this.\\
468 - Well, I guess I can get a night job, and...\\
469 - No, we have to figure out a way to fix us.\\
470 - And I don't mean just now\\
471 - because we're always going to have hard times.\\
472 - We have to figure out a way to get through this\\
473 - without us killing each other.\\
474 - Well, I'm open to suggestions.\\
475 - Okay, here's what we're going to do.\\
476 - You're going to tell me three-- no, five-- no, seven!\\
477 - I want you to tell me seven things you love about me.\\
478 - Seven reasons why this is all worthwhile.\\
479 - Seven reasons why we're still here.\\
480 - Seven?\\
481 - Seven. And I have to believe every one of them\\
482 - and you have to say them all right now.\\
483 - Seven?\\
484 - Oh, just please.\\
485 - Just do it. Okay, okay, okay.\\
486 - Okay, okay, okay, uh...\\
487 - I, I-I-I love,\\
488 - I love how your neck smells in the morning.\\
489 - Okay.\\
490 - That's one.\\
491 - I love how every one of your toes\\
492 - looks like it came from another person's foot.\\
493 - Oh, God.\\
494 - And-And-And I love how you're honest and-and fearless\\
495 - and, and how when I'm sick you treat me like a baby.\\
496 - Okay, that last one counts for two.\\
497 - You got three more to go.\\
498 - Okay.\\
499 - I can tell you that I just adore this.\\
500 - The way your forehead gets all crinkly\\
501 - when you're worried.\\
502 - And I love the way you cut your crust off your toast\\
503 - even though you end up eating both anyway.\\
504 - I love your loyalty and your kindness\\
505 - and that you still suck in your gut\\
506 - whenever I walk into the room.\\
507 - I love how you didn't dump me\\
508 - when you found out that I was in love with you.\\
509 - I love that you still married me\\
510 - even after you met my parents.\\
511 - And I love that nothing in my life--\\
512 - not cribbage with my dad,\\
513 - not a... a new Van Halen album--\\
514 - not even an old Van Halen album, for that matter,\\
515 - or any of their solo albums...\\
516 - Hal, Hal.\\
517 - I love that nothing in my life is complete\\
518 - until I've shared it with you.\\
519 - I love how you send the boys to their room\\
520 - just so we can have some alone time.\\
521 - I just love you.\\
522 -        \\
523 - That's my sandwich.\\
524 - You know, I wouldn't give up a single one of them.\\
525 - They're our boys.\\
526 - No one else can say that.\\
527 - They're our boys.\\
528 - Negative.\\
529 - All that worry for nothing.\\
530 - A girl would have been nice, though.\\
531 - Are you kidding?\\
532 - We've got you outnumbered five to one now\\
533 - and we're still losing.\\
534 - Boys, go to your room!
\section {Malcolm in the Middle Season 03}
\subsection {Episode 01: Houseboat}
1 - Oh, you could fry an egg on my forehead.\\
2 - If you're getting up,\\
3 - would you get me another lemonade?\\
4 - Ready?\\
5 - Stevie's house has air conditioning.\\
6 - Let's get some more.\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - We're not renting the fanciest place on the Big Island, but, you know,\\
20 - at least I'll have a place to work on my cliff diving.\\
21 - Wow.\\
22 - We're actually sharing a houseboat\\
23 - with Stevie's family on a man- made lake by the power plant.\\
24 - I don't want to meet the girl that would impress.\\
25 - Do not touch!\\
26 - I'm not.\\
27 - Hal. Let me see your bathing suit.\\
28 - No. All these ones you picked out\\
29 - are too big and baggy.\\
30 - Baggy is good.\\
31 - It's less surface area I have to shave.\\
32 - I like the little one.\\
33 - No, Hal, you always pop out of the little ones.\\
34 - I do not pop out.\\
35 - That was one time.\\
36 - Hal, the Kenarbans are conservative people.\\
37 - We're going to be in very close quarters with them.\\
38 - Now, you get the baggy ones.\\
39 - Let me just show you something.\\
40 - It better not be that suit in the egg.\\
41 - Don't say anything until you see it.\\
42 - Oh, whoa!\\
43 - Dewey.\\
44 - Can I see that spear gun?\\
45 - Sure.\\
46 - Now, don't tell me this doesn't do something for you.\\
47 - Oh, I-I'm sorry.\\
48 - I thought you were my wife.\\
49 - My wife has the exact same shape...\\
50 - So, maybe when I get back, you know, if you wanted...\\
51 - Maybe I can give you a call.\\
52 - Maybe.\\
53 - Whoa. Look at that guy.\\
54 - Psst. Psst.\\
55 - Do you know him?\\
56 - Who? That nutcase?\\
57 - Of course not.\\
58 - You want to help me choose a surfboard?\\
59 - Okay.\\
60 - Malcolm!\\
61 - Oh, for the love of...\\
62 - Excuse me.\\
63 - Oh! God, it's not me-- it's the suit.\\
64 - I am a normal person!\\
65 - I'm here with my family.\\
66 - My son is right over... Malcolm!\\
67 - Come with me. No, no, no.\\
68 - I know how this looks, but I'm telling you...\\
69 - Malcolm!\\
70 - Wait, no, no, no.\\
71 - This is a complete misunderstanding.\\
72 - Dude, where were you?\\
73 - If Spangler finds out you blew off drill practice,\\
74 - he's going to kill you.\\
75 - I'm not afraid of Spangler anymore.\\
76 - Why aren't you in uniform?\\
77 - I'm leaving. I'm out of here.\\
78 - You can't just leave. Yes.\\
79 - I can. I just turned 18.\\
80 - I'm legally an adult and no one can tell me what to do.\\
81 - I'm getting the hell out of here.\\
82 - You're not going to graduate? Nope.\\
83 - I'm going to Alaska.\\
84 - Francis, it's crazy up there.\\
85 - You can make $45 an hour working on oil rigs or logging camps,\\
86 - and you don't even need a diploma.\\
87 - Wait, $45 an hour?\\
88 - That's with room and board.\\
89 - You work a couple of years, and you're set for life.\\
90 - Something to remember me by.\\
91 - Do you realize how close your father came\\
92 - to being a registered sex offender?!\\
93 - A registered sex offender!\\
94 - And for what? For some trampy girl? For...\\
95 - Mom, please! I feel terrible.\\
96 - I completely understand what I did.\\
97 - I sold out my own father for a girl.\\
98 - It's, like, the worst thing I've ever done.\\
99 - We both agree, I'm a terrible person.\\
100 - For some girl you don't even know!\\
101 - Who wouldn't give you the time of day!\\
102 - That's the gratitude you showed your father.\\
103 - Hey, maybe I'm the good one after all.\\
104 - Here, Mom, for your throat.\\
105 - I put a little honey in it.\\
106 - That man gets\\
107 - one vacation a year,\\
108 - and this is how you start it.\\
109 - You go and make it right!\\
110 - Hello.\\
111 - Dad's probably not that mad at me.\\
112 - I mean, it's not like I personally\\
113 - shoved him in the squad car, right?\\
114 - Dad, can I talk to you?\\
115 - Uh, no, not right now. I'm kind of busy.\\
116 - Reese, can you come in here and help me with something?\\
117 - Oh, sure, Dad.\\
118 - I love to be helpful\\
119 - Close the door.\\
120 - Absolutely not, Francis!\\
121 - Mom, you're not listening.\\
122 - I can make $45 an hour.\\
123 - That's more than you or Dad makes.\\
124 - You are going to graduate from high school.\\
125 - Why spend the tuition?\\
126 - It's a total waste of money.\\
127 - We both know I'm failing.\\
128 - Okay,  now  we both know.\\
129 - Francis, you are going to stay in school until you graduate,\\
130 - and that's all there is to it, and if you flunk out,\\
131 - then that's just another year you're stuck there!\\
132 - You just can't stand the fact\\
133 - that I'll be making more money than you!\\
134 - Whoa, that was close.\\
135 - Oh, look at all this lovely scenery and nature.\\
136 - This is going to be wonderful.\\
137 - Dear, did you pack my hat?\\
138 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.\\
139 - You should have asked me to.\\
140 - No problem.\\
141 - I'll just create one out of newspaper.\\
142 - Everything okay?\\
143 - Everything's wonderful. We're on vacation.\\
144 - The whole drive up here, Dad wouldn't even look at me.\\
145 - I just wish I could take those two minutes back.\\
146 - That's the  King of the Seas?\\
147 - There's no TV! There's no TV! There's no TV!\\
148 - There's no TV!\\
149 - There's your TV.\\
150 - I don't see any TV.\\
151 - Excuse me.\\
152 - Okay.\\
153 - Dad, I'll help you with that.\\
154 - No, no. I've got it.\\
155 - Dad.\\
156 - Please, wait.\\
157 - Come on.\\
158 - Talk to me, please.\\
159 - Okay, fine.\\
160 - I wanted to wait until this afternoon,\\
161 - but what the heck.\\
162 - Check this out.\\
163 - It's a Cavanaugh.\\
164 - You remember last year\\
165 - you saw a picture in a magazine\\
166 - of a father and a son fishing together\\
167 - and you said, "Oh, I'd like to try that sometime"?\\
168 - Yeah?\\
169 - Yeah, well, I just kept looking at that picture\\
170 - and I was thinking about you and me\\
171 - and I... started putting a little money away,\\
172 - and, you know, I just...\\
173 - I got this for you.\\
174 - Oh, man, you wouldn't believe how hard this week has been.\\
175 - Every time that I looked at you,\\
176 - I wanted to spill the beans, but...\\
177 - This is why you wouldn't talk to me?\\
178 - We'll take the dinghy out\\
179 - and we'll do some fishing, just the two of us.\\
180 - Great.\\
181 - See you on board, Skipper.\\
182 - Hey, guess who's still the good one.\\
183 - Do...\\
184 - you...\\
185 - I see it, too.\\
186 - Hey, boys, what are you doing?\\
187 - I don't know-- what are you doing?\\
188 - Where'd you get the boat?\\
189 - We stole it from our spirit camp.\\
190 - We're going to get cigarettes.\\
191 - Spirit camp?\\
192 - So you girls are...?\\
193 - Cheerleaders.\\
194 - Bad...\\
195 - cheerleaders.\\
196 - Yeah. We haven't seen any boys in, like, six weeks.\\
197 - Even you guys are starting to look good.\\
198 - Tammy!\\
199 - Wait. Where are you guys going?\\
200 - Follow us and find out.\\
201 - Get...\\
202 - the boat!\\
203 - Ready to go fishing, son?\\
204 - Now? Sure.\\
205 - We're catching everyone's dinner.\\
206 - Now, don't you take this personally, all right?\\
207 - This is a special thing\\
208 - with Malcolm and me, just this one time.\\
209 - Too bad you can't come with us.\\
210 - Too bad we're taking the boat.\\
211 - Oh. Oh...\\
212 - Nope.\\
213 - At least Reese and Stevie\\
214 - are as bored and miserable as I am.\\
215 - Remember...\\
216 - to call me...\\
217 - Snoop.\\
218 - This is great--\\
219 - to just relax with adults.\\
220 - "Suffocate."\\
221 - Good for you, Abe.\\
222 - "Crybaby."\\
223 - I believe that's two words, dear.\\
224 - Okay, then... just "baby."\\
225 - I heard what happened, cadet.\\
226 - My, my, my, all that splintered wood and broken glass.\\
227 - I brought you something.\\
228 - What's that?\\
229 - A hammer, cadet.\\
230 - I expect you to repair the trophy case.\\
231 - You'll find lumber in the common room.\\
232 - I have a nine-inch gash in my leg.\\
233 - Hmm, that's quite a handicap.\\
234 - Cadet,\\
235 - you damaged school property\\
236 - and you are the one responsible for repairing it.\\
237 - Consider it a character building lesson.\\
238 - I didn't damage anything.\\
239 - That was negligence.\\
240 - The phone was improperly connected to the wall.\\
241 - That is totally unfair!\\
242 - I decide what's fair around here.\\
243 - But, wait, maybe I've been hasty.\\
244 - No, now that I've reconsidered, the decision stands.\\
245 - You will fix the damage by the end of the week.\\
246 - That is all, cadet.\\
247 - Dewey, you have to let go of the rope.\\
248 - You're all sunburned.\\
249 - No.\\
250 - Just let go.\\
251 - It's going to be dark soon.\\
252 - I can't.\\
253 - Yes, you can.\\
254 - Just open your fingers.\\
255 - But I'll fall.\\
256 - That's the point.\\
257 - Dewey, just don't think.\\
258 - Just do it, just let go.\\
259 - No! Oh, for crying out loud.\\
260 - You let go of that rope, and you come in for dinner!\\
261 - Come on, honey.\\
262 - No... ow!\\
263 - Come on, honey, I'm making French fries.\\
264 - Ow!\\
265 - Your favorite-- ice cream.\\
266 - You know you love ice cream.\\
267 - And it was wriggling and fighting me.\\
268 - But finally I got it on the hook.\\
269 - That was one hell of a worm.\\
270 - Thought for sure I'd catch something with it.\\
271 - Oh, Dewey, would you pass the salt, please?\\
272 - Where'd you get that shiner?\\
273 - Mom.\\
274 - It was horrible.\\
275 - We were stuck out there for hours.\\
276 - It was so boring.\\
277 - What are you smiling about?\\
278 - I like these potatoes.\\
279 - You guys went to the camp?\\
280 - Oh, man, what was it like?\\
281 - Imagine a hundred fat guys falling down stairs,\\
282 - knocking over old ladies.\\
283 - Multiply that by ten, and you're not even close.\\
284 - Until today...\\
285 - I'd have traded...\\
286 - my life... for anybody's.\\
287 - No way. It's Mom's.\\
288 - If it were Mom's...\\
289 - would I do this?\\
290 - That was delicious.\\
291 - I am so sorry about Abe.\\
292 - What do you mean?\\
293 - Oh, you're sweet to pretend,\\
294 - but I know he is ruining everyone's vacation\\
295 - with his pouting and his sarcastic little digs.\\
296 - Well, if it's bothering you, you should talk to him.\\
297 - Sure is a beautiful night.\\
298 - You're right.\\
299 - Anything is better than this.\\
300 - Malcolm, better hit the hay.\\
301 - We're getting up pretty early tomorrow.\\
302 - Nighty... night.\\
303 - Oh, I'll tell you what the problem is.\\
304 - I hate this boat!\\
305 - I hate this place!\\
306 - I hate everything about this damn vacation!\\
307 - Then why didn't you say anything?\\
308 - What difference would it make?\\
309 - This whole trip was your idea, and God knows,\\
310 - whatever Kitty wants, Kitty gets!\\
311 - Stop behaving like a total ass.\\
312 - You're ruining everyone's vacation.\\
313 - I could be sitting in a suite in Hawaii right now!\\
314 - You know these people can't afford that.\\
315 - Well, pardon me for going to college\\
316 - and earning a decent living.\\
317 - Should I drive a crappy car because they do, too?\\
318 - No, they cannot hear me.\\
319 - And even if they could, they'd certainly understand\\
320 - that it's just my puckish sense of humor.\\
321 - Oh, it will, too, work.\\
322 - They're not that smart.\\
323 - Turn on the radio. Yeah.\\
324 -        \\
325 - 116...\\
326 - What? Nothing.\\
327 - 117...\\
328 - You know, I didn't want it to come to this,\\
329 - but there's only so far a person can be pushed.\\
330 - You don't have to persuade me.\\
331 - This is exactly the kind of injustice\\
332 - the Alabama legal system was designed to address.\\
333 - Now, just sign here.\\
334 - And we'll need your parent's signatures at the bottom.\\
335 - Great.\\
336 - I'm a notary as well as a lawyer,\\
337 - so I can have this expedited.\\
338 - Great.\\
339 - Hello.\\
340 - Well, he's in with a client right now.\\
341 - Can he call you back?\\
342 - What's your name, sugar?\\
343 - Mom, no, please! We can't watch Dewey.\\
344 - We already have plans.\\
345 - And now they include your brother.\\
346 - Mom...\\
347 - This isn't a negotiation.\\
348 - You're going to take your brother with you\\
349 - and you're going to have fun with him!\\
350 - Now, remember, this is a magic buoy.\\
351 - Mermaids are drawn to it,\\
352 - and they'll grant your every wish.\\
353 - But they won't show up\\
354 - if there's more than one person here.\\
355 - Just leave.\\
356 - Don't insult me.\\
357 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
358 - Me and my naked friends got tired of waiting for you.\\
359 - You don't want that jerk Reese to have all the fun, do you?\\
360 - What happened?\\
361 - You catch something?\\
362 - No.\\
363 - We're never going to catch anything.\\
364 - I know.\\
365 - This is really awful, isn't it?\\
366 - I don't think there's a darned fish\\
367 - in this whole lake.\\
368 - You know what, it doesn't matter.\\
369 - It's just nice being out here with you.\\
370 - Dad?\\
371 - Hmm?\\
372 - You know the other day at the store\\
373 - when I pretended not to know you?\\
374 - Yeah.\\
375 - That was a new low.\\
376 - Well, there was this girl...\\
377 - Really?\\
378 - I'm sorry.\\
379 - I know.\\
380 - Ooh, looks like\\
381 - you got a nibble.\\
382 - Attaboy. Set the hook. Set the hook.\\
383 - Yeah, let him run. Let him run.\\
384 - Okay, now reel him in. Reel him in.\\
385 - Attaboy. Attaboy. Look at that!\\
386 - Come to Papa, baby.\\
387 - You betcha. Oh, yeah!\\
388 - Oh! That's a striper!\\
389 - Look at that beauty! Way to go, Malcolm!\\
390 - Thanks, Dad.\\
391 - He's four pounds if he's an ounce.\\
392 - Yeah.\\
393 - Huh.\\
394 - Isn't this your brother's shirt?\\
395 - Why?\\
396 - You are in so much trouble!\\
397 - I know!\\
398 - I can't believe it either.\\
399 - Hi, Dewey!\\
400 - If you'll excuse me, dear,\\
401 - I believe I'll go take a nap on my luxurious foam pad.\\
402 - How long are you going to let this go on?\\
403 - I tried to talk to him. It just didn't help.\\
404 - Maybe you came on too strong.\\
405 - You can start by apologizing.\\
406 - You don't have to mean it.\\
407 - Look, you have one day of vacation left.\\
408 - You want to spend it like this?\\
409 - All right.\\
410 - I can swallow my pride.\\
411 - Kitty: And you think you're some kind of a picnic?!\\
412 - With your long-suffering sighs\\
413 - and your pouting and your 2:00 a.m. crying jags?!\\
414 - You are a big, overindulged mama's boy!\\
415 - And you are an uptight,\\
416 - impossible-to-please control freak!\\
417 - I can't take it anymore!\\
418 - Well, what you going to do about it, mama's boy?\\
419 - Huh? What's the big mama's boy going to do about it?!\\
420 - Oh, my God.\\
421 -        \\
422 - Sorry.\\
423 - I thought you were fighting.\\
424 - I didn't see anything.\\
425 - Oh, dear God.\\
426 - Three weeks of slave labor,\\
427 - my relationship with Dad will never be the same,\\
428 - and I can't stop smiling.\\
429 - Dewey, remember when we were both stuck on the buoy\\
430 - and you said you wanted to be a ventriloquist?\\
431 - Well, I thought it was something we could do together.\\
432 - Thanks, Dad.\\
433 - You're welcome, son.\\
434 - Oh, my God!\\
435 - What is it?\\
436 - It's Francis!\\
437 - He quit school.\\
438 - He's on his way to Alaska.\\
439 - Well, that's ridiculous.\\
440 - He can't just take himself out of school.\\
441 - He has to have our permission.\\
442 - No, he doesn't.\\
443 - He got himself legally emancipated.
\subsection {Episode 02: Emancipation}
1 - Leaving so soon, cadet?\\
2 - Sir, by statue 614 of the Alabama Legal Code,\\
3 - I am officially emancipated and considered an adult,\\
4 - an adult who no longer chooses\\
5 - to attend Marlin Academy.\\
6 - I have copies of the documents here,\\
7 - if you want to see them again.\\
8 - Oh, no need.\\
9 - I'm sure that everything was done on the up-and-up.\\
10 - Let me tell you something, cadet.\\
11 - In all my years at this Academy,\\
12 - I have never had a student who was more bullheaded,\\
13 - more committed to avoid learning at all costs,\\
14 - a cadet whose constant byword was "insubordination."\\
15 - Thank you, cadet.\\
16 - What?\\
17 - Before you came to this academy,\\
18 - I was bored, uninspired and this close to retiring,\\
19 - but your insolence and stupidity\\
20 - have been the irritating grain of sand\\
21 - around which has formed the pearl of my renaissance.\\
22 - I like me again.\\
23 - Cadet!\\
24 - As a thanks, I want you to have this.\\
25 - Normally, these are reserved\\
26 - for cadets who have distinguished themselves,\\
27 - or whose parents have donated a building,\\
28 - but you've left your mark here in your own way,\\
29 - so what the heck?\\
30 - Wow. Sir, this is great.\\
31 - Farewell, cadet.\\
32 - Thank you so much. Now,\\
33 - careful, that's razor...\\
34 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
35 -     I don't know    \\
36 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
37 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
38 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
39 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
40 -     And you're not so big    \\
41 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
42 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
43 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
44 -     And you're not so big    \\
45 -     Life is unfair.    \\
46 - Normally, I dread the first day of school.\\
47 - My mom's been on such a rampage about Francis,\\
48 - it's actually a relief to get out of the house.\\
49 - Thank God!\\
50 - Summer's over.\\
51 - Hello, babies.\\
52 - How's baby school, babies?\\
53 - Didn't high school start, like, a half hour ago?\\
54 - Hey, if I'm on time today\\
55 - they're going to expect it every day.\\
56 - Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
57 - Hi, Reese. This is Gus.\\
58 - He's in the lead\\
59 - to replace you as school bully.\\
60 - He gives a wedgie that'll knock your socks off.\\
61 - I'm not just saying that\\
62 - 'cause he's got me in a headlock.\\
63 - If you grab your wrist instead of your fingers,\\
64 - you'll get better leverage.\\
65 - You listen to him. He's the man.\\
66 - I've completed the research on our new teacher,\\
67 - if anyone's interested.\\
68 - Lionel Herkabe, born July 8, 1963.\\
69 - Parents-- John and Ida.\\
70 - Notice anything?\\
71 - He was a Krelboyne.\\
72 - We won't have to talk down to him.\\
73 - Finally, someone who knows our pain.\\
74 - "Bentley Gifted High, Princeton, Harvard Business."\\
75 - What's this guy doing teaching?\\
76 - Well, there was some unpleasantness.\\
77 - He quit a government think tank to start a dot-com.\\
78 - One-time net worth $200 million,\\
79 - Now $137.\\
80 - Here he comes! Here he comes!\\
81 - Hurry up.\\
82 - Get out of my way.\\
83 - Who's Dabney?\\
84 - That's me, sir.\\
85 - I took the liberty of ordering you a decaf soy latte.\\
86 - Let me guess.\\
87 - Emotionally needy, closet bed-wetter...\\
88 - you get no affection at home so you'll be seeking it from me.\\
89 - Look elsewhere, son.\\
90 - Who's the anal-retentive outsider?\\
91 - With repressed matricidal tendencies?\\
92 - It was from me, sir! Please, stop.\\
93 - As you may or may not know,\\
94 - I was once one of you... a Krelboyne,\\
95 - and I'm sure I would have made the same\\
96 - lame attempt to ingratiate myself\\
97 - to the new, soft-headed thickwit teaching my class.\\
98 - Oh, yes, I've been there.\\
99 - I have been coddled and preened.\\
100 - "Oh, you're a genius. You can do anything\\
101 - "you set your mind to.\\
102 - It must be so easy being you."\\
103 - Well, bull ...!\\
104 - All that gets you is an ex-wife and $14 million in debt.\\
105 - Now I refuse to let you fall into the trap\\
106 - society has set for you.\\
107 - Playtime is over children.\\
108 - You've had a free ride so far.\\
109 - It's about time somebody motivated you, challenged you,\\
110 - tested your mental limits.\\
111 - Granted, I don't have\\
112 - a teaching certificate\\
113 - from a two-year community college\\
114 - like most of the people I was forced to say hello to\\
115 - this morning in the teachers lounge,\\
116 - but, you know, I'm just going to try to muddle through\\
117 - with my double doctorate from Harvard.\\
118 - This is a test.\\
119 - Correct. You have 20 minutes.\\
120 - There are six essay questions.\\
121 - I'm sorry. I thought this was the gifted class.\\
122 - Begin!\\
123 - Thanks for the ride.\\
124 - Are you sure about this Alaska thing?\\
125 - Oh, absolutely.\\
126 - I don't know.\\
127 - I heard Alaska's supposed to be a hole.\\
128 - Are you kidding?\\
129 - Cruise ships go up there.\\
130 - Only for about six weeks in the summer.\\
131 - Isn't it dark there the rest of the year?\\
132 - I don't have to justify myself to you.\\
133 - I don't have to justify myself to anyone.\\
134 - That's why I got emancipated, okay?\\
135 - Okay.\\
136 - Good luck with your parents.\\
137 - Yeah, well, they had a week to think about it.\\
138 - We'll see how they take it.\\
139 - You...!\\
140 - You ungrateful son of a...!\\
141 - This wasn't meant to hurt you!\\
142 - After all we've done!\\
143 - All I'm saying is that you can get your diploma first\\
144 - and then do what you want.\\
145 - It's all about maximizing your options,\\
146 - taking the long view.\\
147 - Sorry about using "The Closer."\\
148 - Nonsense.\\
149 - I wouldn't have taught it to you\\
150 - if I didn't want you to use it.\\
151 - Listen, what do I always say?\\
152 - "The nards are fair game."\\
153 - The nards are fair game.\\
154 - Look, sometimes you're presented\\
155 - with an opportunity that you just can't pass up.\\
156 - I hope you understand.\\
157 - I'm not the one you have to worry about.\\
158 - I know. And I want\\
159 - to get this straight with Mom.\\
160 - That's why I came here.\\
161 - Okay then.\\
162 - Honey?\\
163 - Um, your son has something to say to you.\\
164 - Huh? I didn't know\\
165 - the Hendersons painted their house.\\
166 - Well, I have your test results.\\
167 - You all got As.\\
168 - But, since this is the gifted class,\\
169 - I also factored in cogency of argument,\\
170 - economy of language\\
171 - and penmanship, which enabled me to do this.\\
172 - What is that?\\
173 - A ranking board.\\
174 - But I thought you said we all got As.\\
175 - Oh, you did.\\
176 - But some of you got better As than others.\\
177 - But we all still have As?\\
178 - Of course.\\
179 - So, what does being number one get you?\\
180 - Nothing.\\
181 - Just the knowledge that you...\\
182 - are number one.\\
183 - Or that you are not...\\
184 - number one.\\
185 - Yes, Number Five.\\
186 - It's Dabney, sir.\\
187 - I know. What is it, Number Five?\\
188 - I forgot.\\
189 - What... a jerk.\\
190 - Is that what we're going to turn out like?\\
191 - If I ever start acting like that,\\
192 - you have to promise to kill me.\\
193 - No, no more death pacts.\\
194 - Don't worry about it.\\
195 - The only way that stupid board\\
196 - can have an effect on us is if we let it.\\
197 - Those numbers mean nothing.\\
198 - What are...\\
199 - you doing?\\
200 - Nothing.\\
201 - You were studying?\\
202 - No, I wasn't.\\
203 - My book just fell open to this page.\\
204 - You know, I'm really not hungry.\\
205 - I think I left my recess stuff in my locker.\\
206 - Oh, my God, high school is awesome.\\
207 - They have an entire room just for detention.\\
208 - They put you in with juniors and seniors.\\
209 - Some of them have records.\\
210 - It's really inspiring.\\
211 - What are you looking at?\\
212 - Francis.\\
213 - He's still out there?\\
214 - Yeah, he's eating out of the bird feeder.\\
215 - Whose shoes are these?\\
216 - Who left their shoes in the living room?\\
217 - Those are mine-- I'm sorry.\\
218 - You're right you're sorry.\\
219 - Leaving your shoes around like you,\\
220 - like you don't even care about them.\\
221 - I hope you like walking to school in your socks!\\
222 - I said I'm sorry.\\
223 - Well, I've heard sorry before.\\
224 - I don't think so.\\
225 - Okay, tell you what we're going to do.\\
226 - From now on,\\
227 - when you want to wear shoes,\\
228 - you check them out.\\
229 - Sign them in, sign them out.\\
230 - Just like a library.\\
231 - Clean up those toys!\\
232 - Oh, thanks.\\
233 - It is freezing out there.\\
234 - Hey, it's good to see you guys.\\
235 - I really missed you.\\
236 - What was that for?\\
237 - Emancipation?\\
238 - What, you're divorcing the family now?\\
239 - How could you do this to Mom?\\
240 - She left me no choice.\\
241 - Ow!\\
242 - We've done a lot of bad things to Mom,\\
243 - but we would never abandon her.\\
244 - I'm not abandoning her.\\
245 - I'm just going to Alaska.\\
246 - That's 5,000 miles away.\\
247 - It is not...\\
248 - 5,000 miles, are you serious?\\
249 - Oh, my God, it's going\\
250 - to take me forever to get up there.\\
251 - Then don't go.\\
252 - Guys, you have to understand.\\
253 - I'm not doing this to hurt anybody.\\
254 - I just... I really think\\
255 - this is my best chance to make something of myself.\\
256 - Tell it to Mom.\\
257 - I can't, she won't talk to me.\\
258 - She is being so immature.\\
259 - In the meantime, I'm stuck outside in the freezing cold.\\
260 - Would it be all right if I slept in here tonight?\\
261 - Certainly, the whale\\
262 - represents the search for God...\\
263 - but that could be limiting.\\
264 - We could say it was\\
265 - the search for the self.\\
266 - Melville could be\\
267 - considered a pre-existentialist.\\
268 - But you can't deny\\
269 - that the whale could also be the search for truth\\
270 - which has been a theme throughout\\
271 - his whole oeuvre.\\
272 - But we can't overlook the fact that it is an actual whale,\\
273 - which was the biggest industry in the 19th century.\\
274 - The oil was used in lamps,\\
275 - soaps and even cosmetics.\\
276 - Today, whaling is outlawed, but many Aleutian islanders\\
277 - are legally allowed to harvest whales\\
278 - for ritual purposes.\\
279 - But I digress!\\
280 - Wow, nine places.\\
281 - That's got to be a record.\\
282 - Okay, on to new business.\\
283 - This Friday, Principal Littledove\\
284 - will be dropping by for a little evaluation.\\
285 - I think he'll be very impressed with what he sees.\\
286 - I don't think he'll understand it,\\
287 - but I think his tiny brain\\
288 - will have the dim perception of the progress you can make\\
289 - when students are properly motivated.\\
290 - Now, who would like to sink their teeth\\
291 - into some Bernoulli equations?\\
292 - Come on, guys.\\
293 - Look at yourselves.\\
294 - If we don't let those\\
295 - stupid rankings get to us, they mean nothing.\\
296 - Easy for you to say, Number One.\\
297 - I have a name.\\
298 - We all have names!\\
299 - Oh, my God, I can't remember mine!\\
300 - This is ridiculous!\\
301 - School used to be the one place where you were truly happy,\\
302 - and Herkabe has taken that away from you.\\
303 - That stupid board\\
304 - is ruining our lives.\\
305 - We can't let him do that.\\
306 - What choice... do we have?\\
307 - We have the choice that people have had for centuries.\\
308 - We can choose to fail.\\
309 - Like the French?\\
310 - You mean... we tank... today's test?\\
311 - No, we don't tank it.\\
312 - We nuke it.\\
313 - Every answer wrong.\\
314 - No complete sentences.\\
315 - No punctuation.\\
316 - And we use number three pencils.\\
317 - You can't rank zeros!\\
318 - That's brilliant!\\
319 - He'll have no choice\\
320 - but to throw out his stupid system!\\
321 - We'll be free!\\
322 - I'm very disappointed in you.\\
323 - Everyone else, nice job.\\
324 - I'm sorry.\\
325 - I'm sorry.\\
326 - I tried.\\
327 - My hand wouldn't let me.\\
328 - I regret...\\
329 - nothing.\\
330 - Interesting gambit, but I guess\\
331 - the Lemmings didn't follow you off the cliff.\\
332 - When you've spent some time in the real world,\\
333 - you'll realize you can't fight the system, and now...\\
334 - I'm  the system.\\
335 - Don't worry, I just let the air out.\\
336 - We can talk while I put on your spare.\\
337 - Look, I'm sorry I had to resort to this,\\
338 - but you have to give me five minutes so we can talk.\\
339 - I can talk over the music!\\
340 - You can't drive on a flat!\\
341 - You're going to ruin your rims!\\
342 - That was a red light!\\
343 - You might want to notice\\
344 - my entire opening paragraph is a palindrome.\\
345 - You might want to notice...\\
346 - my formatting.\\
347 - What's this?\\
348 - A study of irrigation techniques of pre-Roman society and how\\
349 - they led to the advancement of Western civilization.\\
350 - I thought we were just studying Mesopotamian farming techniques.\\
351 - We were.\\
352 - I just used that as a jumping-off point.\\
353 - I saw how their influences spread through the Egyptians,\\
354 - the Carthaginians, basically through the whole ancient world.\\
355 - I think you'll be very happy with this paper.\\
356 - Very nice, Number Twelve.\\
357 - It's nice to see a little effort put forth\\
358 - while some are content to do the absolute minimum.\\
359 - So... he wants... to play.\\
360 - Oh, we'll play all right.\\
361 - What is it we're playing?\\
362 -        \\
363 -        \\
364 - Okay, I think we're ready\\
365 - to show Principal Littledove\\
366 - what the right kind of motivation can accomplish.\\
367 - Well done, class.\\
368 - You know, maybe we should just put our heads down\\
369 - and take a rest for a moment, shall we?\\
370 - Yes, One-to-the-Eleventh?\\
371 - Did you know I can count to a million by prime numbers?\\
372 - I can, too!\\
373 - So can I! It's easy.\\
374 - That's not necessary.\\
375 - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...\\
376 - 13, 17, 19...\\
377 - 23, 29, 31.\\
378 - Now by hundreds!\\
379 - 101, 211, 307, 401, 503, 601...\\
380 - 7!\\
381 - 7! No!\\
382 - Okay, that is enough, One-to-the-Eleventh.\\
383 - By thousands! 1,009...\\
384 - 2,003...\\
385 - Now back by hundreds!\\
386 - 2,111, 2,203...\\
387 - 2... 11...\\
388 - No!\\
389 - Where are you going, Number Three?\\
390 - It's hot.\\
391 - It's hot and I'm stupid!\\
392 - I'm stupid, too!\\
393 - Everybody, please remain seated!\\
394 - I'm Zero!\\
395 - Zero-to-the-Zeroth!\\
396 - I'm nothing!\\
397 - I'm invisible!\\
398 - Boy, that's quite a show for your first week here.\\
399 - You were right, you can't beat the system,\\
400 - but you sure can break it.\\
401 - I love you guys.\\
402 - I'll write you when I get there, okay?\\
403 - Someday, when you come back\\
404 - and you're unemployed and have no place to live,\\
405 - you can come stay at my castle.\\
406 - Thanks, bud.\\
407 - He's leaving.\\
408 - He just wants to talk to you.\\
409 - Just hear him out.\\
410 - Lois, this... this has got to stop.\\
411 - He's going very far away\\
412 - and you're not going to see him for a very long time.\\
413 - Honey, there are moments in life\\
414 - that you just don't get back, and I know you.\\
415 - If you do not deal with this now,\\
416 - it will haunt you forever.\\
417 - Fine.\\
418 - I've lost a son but gained a baby.\\
419 - I tried.\\
420 - I know.\\
421 - Are you sure this is what you want?\\
422 - Well, it'd better be.\\
423 - Francis.\\
424 - I'm listening.\\
425 - This is what you get!\\
426 - This is what you get for the way you treated me!\\
427 - I'm going to Alaska and you're going to be left without a son!\\
428 - And the horrible way you treated me\\
429 - is now a matter of public record!\\
430 - I treated  you?!\\
431 - We've made sacrifice after sacrifice for you\\
432 - and you've caused us nothing but pain!\\
433 - You want pain?! I've got your scars, baby!\\
434 - 3h years in that horrible school...\\
435 - We went without for that school!\\
436 - Oh!\\
437 - Oh! Maybe I should thank you!\\
438 - Thank you, Mother, for making my life a living hell!\\
439 - Living hell?! You've been nothing\\
440 - but a problem since the day you were born.\\
441 - Your problems are over, lady, 'cause I'm out of here!
\subsection {Episode 03: Book Club}
1 - What are you doing?\\
2 - They started showering in gym class.\\
3 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
4 -     I don't know    \\
5 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     And you're not so big    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     Life is unfair.    \\
15 - Could you pass the peas, please?\\
16 - Thank you.\\
17 - You're welcome.\\
18 - Hal.\\
19 - All right, boys, that's enough.\\
20 - Do you think for once\\
21 - we could have a civilized conversation during dinner,\\
22 - free of sound effects?\\
23 - Your mother's right. I don't think it's asking too much\\
24 - for us to have some nice dinner conversation.\\
25 - Malcolm, how was school today?\\
26 - History class was cool.\\
27 - Really? Tell us about it.\\
28 - Jimmy Perkins kicked the crap\\
29 - out of Fred Nason right outside our window.\\
30 - He beat up Fred Nason? That dude's huge.\\
31 - I know! I couldn't believe it.\\
32 - Fred knocked Jimmy's hat off,\\
33 - and Jimmy turned and punched him in the face,\\
34 - like, five times in a row in, like, a second.\\
35 - Fred fell in the bush and then he just started\\
36 - hitting him and hitting him and hitting him.\\
37 - It was awesome.\\
38 - Jimmy Perkins is crazy.\\
39 - It's like I've always told you boys--\\
40 - crazy beats big every time.\\
41 - So, how was your day, dear?\\
42 - Hey, Eric, it's Francis.\\
43 - How's Alaska?\\
44 - Francis, where are you?\\
45 - You were supposed to be here two weeks ago.\\
46 - I know, but no one will pick me up.\\
47 - I ran out of money and had to work tarring roofs for a week.\\
48 - Apparently there's a serial killer\\
49 - loose in Idaho who looks just like me.\\
50 - You'd better get here soon.\\
51 - I don't know how much longer they'll hold the job.\\
52 - I'm almost there.\\
53 - Listen, do I take the Provincial Highway 99\\
54 - or do I take the 27 to Provincial Highway 12?\\
55 - What? Where are you?\\
56 - I'm close to British Columbia.\\
57 - I'm in Bellingham, Washington.\\
58 - Francis, you're still 2,000 miles away.\\
59 - What? No way. I got to be near Alaska.\\
60 - I just exchanged all my money for Alaskan dollars.\\
61 - There's no such thing as Alaskan dollars.\\
62 - Sir!\\
63 - Are you almost finished with that?\\
64 - What have you got in mind?\\
65 - I need you to watch the boys next Tuesday night.\\
66 - I've joined a book club.\\
67 - Oh, Lois, you don't want to do that.\\
68 - I joined a record club once, and they hounded me for years.\\
69 - It's not that kind of a club, Hal.\\
70 - This is women from school-- adults-- discussing books.\\
71 - Oh.\\
72 - I live in a house\\
73 - filled with boys.\\
74 - I listen to boy talk\\
75 - and boy noises.\\
76 - I need to spend some time with females.\\
77 - Mm-hmm.\\
78 - Whenever I see them at the PTA meetings,\\
79 - they always invite me to do things with them and I never go.\\
80 - Mm-hmm, yeah.\\
81 - I need to do this for my sanity.\\
82 - Yeah. Hee-hee-hee-hee, yes.\\
83 - Yeah. Are you even listening to me?\\
84 - Of course I am.\\
85 - Here's what I think:\\
86 - this book club is a great idea, Lois.\\
87 - It's about time you did something like this.\\
88 - You have a brilliant and beautiful mind\\
89 - that needs challenging.\\
90 - I just hope those other women can keep up with you.\\
91 - Now, make a wish.\\
92 - Okay, I left the phone number on the counter.\\
93 - The dishes are soaking in the sink.\\
94 - I took the batteries out of the remote\\
95 - and I put them in the smoke detector--\\
96 - just for tonight.\\
97 - Would you relax, honey?\\
98 - You're off the clock.\\
99 - This is supposed to be your night out.\\
100 - Just enjoy yourself, huh?\\
101 - Stop worrying. Yeah, Mom. Have fun.\\
102 - Oh, oh, oh.\\
103 - Uh, remember to take\\
104 - the garbage cans to the curb tonight.\\
105 - Would you please stop worrying?\\
106 - Just go have some fun.\\
107 - Now?\\
108 - No. Let's let Mom get a few blocks away.\\
109 - Right. This could be a trick.\\
110 - What are you guys talking about?\\
111 - We've got some fireworks buried in the backyard.\\
112 - We're going to dig them up while Mom's gone.\\
113 - Tracy Hines is having a party\\
114 - tomorrow night and we're not invited.\\
115 - Our justice will be swift but fair.\\
116 - We'll be fine!\\
117 - Okay, I don't want to screw this up.\\
118 - Lois needs time to herself.\\
119 - She deserves a night out.\\
120 - She'll have a great time and then come home all happy.\\
121 - I just have to somehow keep the boys under control.\\
122 - Oh, what am I talking about? They're good kids.\\
123 - What am I talking about "what am I talking about"?\\
124 - They're monsters!\\
125 - They'll destroy everything and then ruin Lois's night,\\
126 - and then, then she'll feel like we can't be trusted on our own.\\
127 - She'll never want to have a night out again,\\
128 - and it will all be my fault!\\
129 - We're going out back.\\
130 - You're not going anywhere.\\
131 - You're going to stay\\
132 - in your room all night with the door shut! Now go!\\
133 - Go!\\
134 - Mmm. This cheddar is wonderful.\\
135 - It is good.\\
136 - So, I really liked the book.\\
137 - Really?\\
138 - Oh, Karen, let's have some more of that wine.\\
139 - I like the way the author shifted\\
140 - the voice of the narrator from character to character.\\
141 - Oh...\\
142 - well, I'll just have to take your word on that.\\
143 - I didn't really read the book.\\
144 - Oh.\\
145 - Was anyone else confused by those flashbacks?\\
146 - Am I the only one who read the book?\\
147 - Actually, Lois, we don't make it mandatory to read the book.\\
148 - What? I mean, we're all busy.\\
149 - But that shouldn't prevent us\\
150 - from enjoying a relaxing evening\\
151 - every once in a while.\\
152 - Lois, don't you feel you deserve\\
153 - one night away from the bickering,\\
154 - the yelling and the TV blaring?\\
155 - Away from all\\
156 - the stupid little problems\\
157 - that can't seem to be solved without you?\\
158 - Little more.\\
159 - Oh, thank you.\\
160 - Thank you for stopping.\\
161 - Oh, glad to. My name's Roy.\\
162 - I'm Francis. God, it's freezing out there.\\
163 - I've been standing in that same stretch of road for six hours.\\
164 - People were actually flipping me off as they drove past me.\\
165 - Why would they do that?\\
166 - So, how far you going?\\
167 - Mamu.\\
168 - I'm going up to Green River.\\
169 - I can take you almost the whole way.\\
170 - Oh, my God, really?\\
171 - It's taken me the last three days to get 20 miles.\\
172 - Thank you.\\
173 - You okay?\\
174 - Yeah. It's just...\\
175 - people aren't very nice.\\
176 - You want some coffee?\\
177 - Yes.\\
178 - And when I was leaving,\\
179 - my mom and I are yelling and screaming at each other\\
180 - and she's still finding the time to tell the cab driver\\
181 - which route to take to the bus station.\\
182 - She's a total control freak.\\
183 - She sounds like she's afraid.\\
184 - What would my mom have to be afraid of?\\
185 - Well, she could be afraid\\
186 - that if she doesn't control every aspect of her life\\
187 - or the lives of the people she cares about,\\
188 - that horrible things will happen.\\
189 - Like what horrible things?\\
190 - Well, maybe her oldest son\\
191 - moving 5,000 miles away from her?\\
192 - All right, you got me there.\\
193 - You're pretty smart.\\
194 - Well, I'm on the road 18 hours a day.\\
195 - Gives me a lot of time to think about things,\\
196 - about people, why they do the things they do.\\
197 - I'm kind of a wannabe psychiatrist.\\
198 - Well, I'm just glad to finally be out of it.\\
199 - I got a line that I'm not going to cross\\
200 - and if anyone tries to push me across it, I'm gone.\\
201 - Well, sure,\\
202 - everybody's got a line.\\
203 - But what's interesting is, everyone's line is different.\\
204 - Sometimes it moves.\\
205 - I mean, look at your situation right here.\\
206 - It is freezing cold, there's no other cars on the road.\\
207 - Hypothetically, if I said\\
208 - "Put on a curly, red wig\\
209 - or I'll throw you out of the truck,"\\
210 - are you really going to go back out into the cold?\\
211 - Yeah, but that's ridiculous.\\
212 - You can't use a silly example like that to prove...\\
213 - You're kidding.\\
214 - Okay, okay.\\
215 - You haven't made a sound in a half an hour!\\
216 - What's going on in here?\\
217 - Nothing. I expect perfect behavior\\
218 - out of you boys tonight.\\
219 - Trust me, if you try anything-- anything at all--\\
220 - I will be on you like a rainbow on an oil slick!\\
221 - Okay, this is good.\\
222 - You sent them a message.\\
223 - Fired a shot across their bow.\\
224 - Now they know who's in charge.\\
225 - Maybe I was too harsh.\\
226 - If the boys push back,\\
227 - they might do something ten times worse\\
228 - and spoil everything for Lois.\\
229 - Don't go soft.\\
230 - All these boys understand is the iron fist.\\
231 - No. I need to get them on my side.\\
232 - Dewey, you be lookout while we dig up the fireworks.\\
233 - What's going on with Dad?\\
234 - I don't know.\\
235 - Maybe he's dealing with something at work.\\
236 - I hope he's going to be okay.\\
237 - At his age, carrying around that kind of tension\\
238 - can't be good for you.\\
239 - Whoa! Dad's here.\\
240 - Who wants ice cream?\\
241 - So, I come home after working a ten-hour shift\\
242 - and I see my boys,\\
243 - and they're covered with grass\\
244 - and they're covered with paint, and they look at me\\
245 - and you know what all they can say is?\\
246 - "Where's dinner?"\\
247 - Oh, yeah.\\
248 - Oh, yeah.\\
249 - Too much is expected of us.\\
250 - Well, our society is just so screwed up.\\
251 - 30 years ago, you could just at least pick something\\
252 - and go with it.\\
253 - A housewife, a career woman, sex slave.\\
254 - But now you're supposed to do everything, and it's impossible!\\
255 - Unless you're Lillian Miller.\\
256 - Oh, yeah.\\
257 - You know, if it weren't for me,\\
258 - my family would be naked,\\
259 - living in trees, eating berries.\\
260 - I mean, do they appreciate what I do for them? No!\\
261 - No.\\
262 - Lillian Miller's family\\
263 - just surprised her with a trip to Spain.\\
264 - Really? No kidding.\\
265 - You know, the other day\\
266 - I discovered a two- inch long hair\\
267 - growing out of my shoulder.\\
268 - I mean, how long has that been there?\\
269 - I don't even have time to put myself together in the morning.\\
270 - Lillian Miller...\\
271 - brought 20 homemade cakes to the school bake sale.\\
272 - I had those.\\
273 - They were delicious.\\
274 - The woman just cooks like a god, but she never puts on a pound.\\
275 - You can't be 45 and still be a size two.\\
276 - That's children sizes. That's for children!\\
277 - And Lillian!\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - You know, ladies,\\
280 - I just realized something.\\
281 - Society isn't the thing that's making us miserable.\\
282 - I mean, hell, we're society.\\
283 - Uh-huh, yeah.\\
284 - No, no.\\
285 - Every single one of our problems can be traced back\\
286 - to that tight-assed, overachieving,\\
287 - marathon-running, master chef, Lillian Miller.\\
288 -     Mademoiselle from Armentieres    \\
289 -     Parlez vous    \\
290 -     Mademoiselle from Armentieres    \\
291 -     Parlez vous    \\
292 -     She got the palm and croix de guerre    \\
293 -     For washing soldiers' underwear    \\
294 -     Hinky-dinky, parlez vous.    \\
295 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What?\\
296 - It's "Hinky-dinky, parlez vous."\\
297 - That's what I said, Roy.\\
298 - No. You said, "Inky-dinky."\\
299 - Now you've got to start over.\\
300 - I'm not starting over.\\
301 - It's freezing out there.\\
302 - I can barely feel my lips anymore.\\
303 -     Mademoiselle from Armentieres    \\
304 -     Parlez vous    \\
305 -     Mademoiselle from Armentieres    \\
306 -     Parlez...    \\
307 - Thanks for the ice cream, dad.\\
308 - Oh, you're welcome, Dewey.\\
309 - Don't worry about this mess. I'll take care of it.\\
310 - Boys, just sit there and... relax.\\
311 - All right, what the hell is going on?\\
312 - I'm not sure, but I think\\
313 - he's feeling guilty about something.\\
314 - Maybe we can exploit it.\\
315 - How? Why don't we send Dewey in there crying\\
316 - about the train set Mom put in the attic?\\
317 - Mom didn't put a train set in the attic.\\
318 - Exactly. When he's up there trying to find it,\\
319 - you and I can dig up the fireworks\\
320 - before mom gets home.\\
321 - Dewey, we need you to cry.\\
322 - But it's got to be the right kind of crying.\\
323 - Not sobbing, more of a whiny sound\\
324 - with a penetrating quality.\\
325 - Give me a moment.\\
326 - Okay, that was a good idea.\\
327 - The boys are happy.\\
328 - I think you've got them motivated to behave themselves,\\
329 - and, and Lois is, is going to see\\
330 - that I can handle them without her.\\
331 - Are you kidding me?\\
332 - You've gone soft.\\
333 - You've totally lost the boys' respect.\\
334 - Lois isn't going to like this.\\
335 - Come on.\\
336 - They're under control.\\
337 - But what if they aren't?\\
338 - What if they're just pretending to behave\\
339 - so they can set you up?\\
340 - You've got to occupy these boys,\\
341 - keep them so busy, they don't have time to get in trouble.\\
342 - How am I going to keep them busy?\\
343 - Well, you'd better find a way.\\
344 - Dad, Dewey really wants you to...\\
345 - Boys, let's spend a little time together.\\
346 - We can, uh... Ah! I know, I know!\\
347 - We can, uh, do some calisthenics.\\
348 - What? Come on, you boys love to exercise.\\
349 - But I just ate a ton of ice cream.\\
350 - All the more reason.\\
351 - You are starting to get a little flabby. Come on.\\
352 - I'm too full.\\
353 - Well, when you start moving, you'll feel better!\\
354 - Let's go! One, two.\\
355 - One, two.\\
356 - One, two. One, two.\\
357 - Stupid, stupid.\\
358 - It was a terrible idea.\\
359 - It was a great idea.\\
360 - A great idea poorly executed.\\
361 - Terrible idea, terrible execution.\\
362 - Why don't you just lock them in the bathroom\\
363 - till Lois gets home, and be done with it?!\\
364 - Shh!\\
365 - Look at that house.\\
366 - It's perfect.\\
367 - No, no, no!\\
368 - We didn't come here for mindless vandalism.\\
369 - We came to screw up her car.\\
370 - Let's see how she feels\\
371 - when she's ten minutes late for carpool\\
372 - like a real person.\\
373 - She probably won't even be able\\
374 - to get out of bed in the morning.\\
375 - Yeah, this time next year\\
376 - she's going to be living in a trailer\\
377 - with a little ceramic donkey in the front yard.\\
378 - Oh, shh!\\
379 - Shh!\\
380 - She's wearing pearls to make cookies?\\
381 - Doilies?\\
382 - What kind of a monster is this woman?\\
383 - Oh, God, those cookies smell good.\\
384 - Let's kill her and eat them.\\
385 - Karen...\\
386 - why don't you go stand guard?\\
387 - Come on.\\
388 - Shh! Shh!\\
389 - Shh!\\
390 - Ooh.\\
391 - One of us should probably know something about cars.\\
392 - Ah, doesn't matter, just pull some of the wires.\\
393 - Let's get out of here.\\
394 - Karen, Karen.\\
395 - You got to stop.\\
396 - Karen.\\
397 - You got to settle down.\\
398 - Whoa!\\
399 - Karen, why don't you see\\
400 - if you can say the alphabet backwards.\\
401 - Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q\\
402 - P, O, N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.\\
403 - I've been pulled over a few times.\\
404 - Hey! Lillian's gone.\\
405 - What do you mean Lillian's gone?\\
406 - Run!\\
407 - This is a pointless exercise. You haven't proven a thing.\\
408 - You certainly haven't determined what my limits are.\\
409 - None of this has bothered me.\\
410 - And if you think it has, the joke is on you.\\
411 - Clench.\\
412 - That's the third time\\
413 - he drove down that alley.\\
414 - He knows we're in here.\\
415 - This is gross.\\
416 - I can't believe I'm wearing open-toed shoes.\\
417 - I can't believe I'm hiding from the cops in a Dumpster.\\
418 - I just wanted to talk about books.\\
419 - Oh, and it was such a good book, too.\\
420 - The foreshadowing was effective without being heavy-handed,\\
421 - the characters were, were flawed\\
422 - but compelling,\\
423 - and the entire story was brimming with insight\\
424 - into the human condition.\\
425 - But how did you even find time to read it?\\
426 - Your family sounds so horrible.\\
427 - I was lying.\\
428 - I made all that stuff up so that I would fit in.\\
429 - They're wonderful.\\
430 - I mean, they're idiots, but at least they try.\\
431 - They wanted me to have this nice evening,\\
432 - and look what I did with it.\\
433 - What are you doing?\\
434 - You'll see.\\
435 - Go home to your family and hug them for me.\\
436 - They sound wonderful.\\
437 - Hi, piggies!\\
438 - Over here!\\
439 - Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.\\
440 - Come on!\\
441 - Show me what you got!\\
442 - Am I supposed to be afraid of an electric shaver?\\
443 - (Taser buzzes, Karen screams)\\
444 - It's lighter than most other minerals...\\
445 - Why is he making us watch a documentary about salt?\\
446 - Would you rather still be locked in the bathroom?\\
447 - Or be chased by the hug monster?\\
448 - Will you just do something? I'm trying.\\
449 - But every time we make a move, he's two steps ahead of us.\\
450 - He's impossible to predict.\\
451 - At least with Mom, you get a little consistency.\\
452 - But Dad's operating on a whole other plane.\\
453 - Hey, they put salt on French fries.\\
454 - Ground them.\\
455 - Cut off their food supply.\\
456 - They just need love.\\
457 - Give them the belt.\\
458 - These are precious years!\\
459 - Get in the car and go.\\
460 - Shut up!\\
461 - Okay, that's it.\\
462 - I am going to take a bath.\\
463 - I'm asking you boys one last time to behave.\\
464 - Not for me\\
465 - but for your mother.\\
466 - After all she does for you,\\
467 - one night of peace shouldn't be too much\\
468 - to ask for.\\
469 - So if you love her, you will do this for her.\\
470 - Wow, Francis,\\
471 - I've never had anyone empty the box before.\\
472 - I'm out of props.\\
473 - You know, I wasn't on board\\
474 - with your little experiment at first,\\
475 - but I got to admit,\\
476 - I learned a lot about myself tonight.\\
477 - I mean, who am I to judge other people\\
478 - for the choices they make?\\
479 - You know, for now on\\
480 - I'm going to be a little more understanding\\
481 - and a lot more humble.\\
482 - You want to stop for some dinner?\\
483 - What, like this?\\
484 - Sure.\\
485 - Why not like this?\\
486 - Have you ever thought about writing a book?\\
487 - Because I'm sure there's a lot of people... Hey, Myrna.\\
488 - What time's the pageant?\\
489 - Fluffy's collar?\\
490 - Mom said he ran away.\\
491 - Get out of there, Dewey.\\
492 - Tracy really should have invited us.\\
493 - This is what people get for being rude.\\
494 - Okay, we'll hide these in the closet tonight.\\
495 - When we get out, we'll cover up the hole,\\
496 - and by the time Mom's home,\\
497 - we'll be in bed sleeping like babies.\\
498 - Boys!\\
499 - Fireworks?!\\
500 - Fireworks?!\\
501 - How did she...? I don't know.\\
502 - You boys are in so much trouble.\\
503 - I can't leave you alone for a second!\\
504 - I guess next time I go out,\\
505 - I'll have to chain you to the floor.\\
506 - We tell you to behave, and you don't even pretend to listen!\\
507 - You might as well cut off your ears\\
508 - and throw them in the trash for as little as you use them.\\
509 - You are grounded for the next month!\\
510 - Get down on the ground\\
511 - with your hands behind your head!\\
512 - And while you're being punished,\\
513 - I hope your friends are doing all sorts of fun stuff\\
514 - because you won't be doing any of it!\\
515 - You are going to suffer!\\
516 - No TV!\\
517 - Oh, I should get out there. No visitors!\\
518 - Nah, you'd just screw it up.\\
519 - Good call.
\subsection {Episode 04: Malcolm's Girlfriend}
1 - You would not. I would too.\\
2 - No clothes at all.\\
3 - Go all the way across the street\\
4 - and ring Mrs. Conlin's doorbell.\\
5 - Yeah, I would totally do it,\\
6 - but you don't have ten bucks.\\
7 - Dewey?\\
8 - Ah-ah-ah.\\
9 - No underwear.\\
10 - No clothes at all.\\
11 - Of course.\\
12 - What are you doing?\\
13 - You said no clothes.\\
14 - I'll be right back, losers.\\
15 - I never thought he'd do it.\\
16 - I guess he outsmarted us.\\
17 - You opened her gate, right?\\
18 - Of course.\\
19 - Good dog, good dog...\\
20 - Go away! Somebody help! No! No!\\
21 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
22 -     I don't know    \\
23 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
31 -     And you're not so big    \\
32 -     Life is unfair.    \\
33 - So the universe...\\
34 - can be... finite...\\
35 - and unbounded...\\
36 - but if...\\
37 - Are you... listening?\\
38 - Oh, my God. Sara Coleman is so beautiful.\\
39 - Look at the way she runs her hand through her hair.\\
40 - And that smile.\\
41 - You look at her and you can't even see anyone else.\\
42 - Every day... you do this.\\
43 - Ask her... out.\\
44 - Come on, Stevie.\\
45 - Sara would never go out with me.\\
46 - She's smart, she's cool, she's good-looking,\\
47 - and if we went out together, it would make me happy.\\
48 - So therefore, it will never happen.\\
49 - I am destined to be the most miserable person on earth.\\
50 - Boo...\\
51 - ...hoo.\\
52 - Shut up.\\
53 - Look, it's complicated, okay?\\
54 - You don't just walk up to a girl and say, "Hey, I like you."\\
55 - You'd look like an idiot.\\
56 - You have to know the right way to say things and...\\
57 - Sara wants to know if you like her.\\
58 - What? He likes her!\\
59 - Oh. She likes him, too.\\
60 - Remember yesterday when we were sitting around,\\
61 - and then we got a drink of water,\\
62 - and then we sat around again?\\
63 - We should totally do that again.\\
64 - Okay.\\
65 - Look at me. It's official.\\
66 - I have a girlfriend!\\
67 - I'm officially someone's boyfriend!\\
68 - Watch this.\\
69 - I can do that any time I want.\\
70 - I hate this part.\\
71 - This where we have to split up so my family won't see us.\\
72 - I'll miss you.\\
73 - You're a really good kisser.\\
74 - Thanks.\\
75 - Bye.\\
76 - "Thanks?"\\
77 - What does that mean?\\
78 - What's wrong with the way I kiss?\\
79 - Are my lips too wet?\\
80 - Maybe they're too dry.\\
81 - I don't see why she couldn't just return the compliment!\\
82 - God, I'm the worst boyfriend ever.\\
83 - Okay, just calm down.\\
84 - I'm a good boyfriend.\\
85 - She wouldn't be my girlfriend if I wasn't.\\
86 - I have a girlfriend!\\
87 - I don't understand.\\
88 - All I did was take a donut out of a Dumpster!\\
89 - How is that stealing?\\
90 - I had to fight a cat to get it!\\
91 - Well, the restaurant owner wants to press charges.\\
92 - There's nothing I can do.\\
93 - Look, I know the guy.\\
94 - He's a bit of a hothead, but I promise you\\
95 - he'll lose interest in four or five days.\\
96 - Four or five days?!\\
97 - I have to start a logging job up in Mamu, and I'm late as it is!\\
98 - It won't be so bad.\\
99 - Three square meals a day, courtesy of my wife.\\
100 - You look like you could use some home cooking.\\
101 - What would you like for dinner?\\
102 - Chicken or a nice porterhouse steak?\\
103 - A porterhouse, I guess.\\
104 - Oh, you're going to love her cooking.\\
105 - Well, thank you.\\
106 - At first, I had no idea what was going on.\\
107 - And then I realized I was looking\\
108 - at a 425 requisition form.\\
109 - Shelby had filled it out thinking it was a 428.\\
110 - Oh, this isn't interesting, is it?\\
111 - No, wait, it is.\\
112 - You just need to know what a 425 form is.\\
113 - You see, there's a subtle difference between...\\
114 - Dewey, how was your day?\\
115 - I've got a new friend.\\
116 - His name's Ronnie. He just moved here.\\
117 - He's got a Nintendo, a Playstation and a nanny.\\
118 - He's really rich.\\
119 - Oh? Nice to meet you, Ronnie.\\
120 - No! He's real.\\
121 - I can make real friends, too.\\
122 - Oh, of course you can, honey. Just don't be too frustrated\\
123 - if it takes you a little bit longer than the other boys.\\
124 - Ronnie is real!\\
125 - Reese! What are you doing?!\\
126 - Malcolm's got a girlfriend.\\
127 - What?! Son, is this true?\\
128 - Reese! Damn, I was saving that for report card day!\\
129 - She's not...\\
130 - We're just friends.\\
131 - Malcolm, look at me!\\
132 - Oh, my God, it's true...\\
133 - Malcolm, no! You do not do this yet!\\
134 - I saw them behind the 7-Eleven, French-kissing.\\
135 - That's with tongue, Mom.\\
136 - Don't you want to go to college?\\
137 - Don't you care about your future?\\
138 - Malcolm, you are not mature enough\\
139 - to prioritize between homework and some prepubescent tramp!\\
140 - Your mother is right, son.\\
141 - I waited until I was 11 before I kissed my...\\
142 - Wait, how old are you? Never mind.\\
143 - What I'm saying is, it was a different time back then.\\
144 - There was a war on.\\
145 - I'll get it.\\
146 - Maybe that's Malcolm's girlfriend\\
147 - who's come over for a little French-kissing.\\
148 - Who is this girl?\\
149 - Mom, don't make such a big deal out of this.\\
150 - I didn't tell anyone because I knew\\
151 - this is exactly how you people would react.\\
152 - This is none of your business.\\
153 - It's nobody's business!\\
154 - It's not a big deal, okay?!\\
155 - Well, it's not.\\
156 - And I would appreciate it if we could just drop it.\\
157 - This is Ronnie DeMarco.\\
158 - As you can see, he's real.\\
159 - Ow!\\
160 - Hmm...\\
161 - Interesting.\\
162 - We'll be in my room.\\
163 - I can't believe how much stuff you have.\\
164 - Want to play cowboys?\\
165 - Nah, I hate cowboys.\\
166 - You can have 'em.\\
167 - Really? Thanks!\\
168 - No take-backs.\\
169 - Hey.\\
170 - Ronnie, would you please\\
171 - empty the dishwasher for Mommy?\\
172 - Okay...\\
173 - Okay.\\
174 - So, Dewey, come here, come here.\\
175 - Ronnie's birthday's coming up,\\
176 - and I want to throw him a surprise party.\\
177 - But he doesn't know that many people here\\
178 - because of the move and all.\\
179 - And I thought maybe since you're his first friend\\
180 - here in the neighborhood, you could help me.\\
181 - Okay. Okay, now,\\
182 - I want to invite your entire class.\\
183 - All 30 kids?\\
184 - Well, yeah, isn't that what you do\\
185 - for your birthday parties?\\
186 - Oh? What are we celebrating?\\
187 - One, two, three, four, five...\\
188 - Damn it, you get back here right now!\\
189 - I wish I was dead!\\
190 - Sorta.\\
191 - I was thinking Ronnie would like\\
192 - a Star Wars theme for his party.\\
193 - No, do cowboys!\\
194 - What? Cowboys.\\
195 - He likes cowboys better than Star Wars.\\
196 - Okay, that'll be fun.\\
197 - Thank you, Dewey.\\
198 - Oh, Brock...\\
199 - Vanessa?\\
200 - You're trembling. What's wrong?\\
201 - Chad's getting suspicious.\\
202 - You know he's been asking\\
203 - questions at the orphanage.\\
204 - We need to get out of here.\\
205 - And say good-bye to all that money? I don't think so.\\
206 - We just need to bide our time.\\
207 - How can I trust you, Brock,\\
208 - when you haven't even told Cassandra about us yet?\\
209 - Have a heart, Vanessa. The woman's still in a coma.\\
210 - Coma?\\
211 - Hey, honey.\\
212 - I just got back from the mayor's office.\\
213 - He thinks he's going to kill our little real estate deal.\\
214 - We can't let him do that! What about those pictures\\
215 - of him and the Hastings girl?\\
216 - They're on their way to the newspapers right now.\\
217 - We're going to destroy the old bastard.\\
218 - Perfect. Now all we have to worry about is old man Landers.\\
219 - Mmm.\\
220 - Maybe we should send Largo\\
221 - to pay him a little visit.\\
222 - What'd I miss?\\
223 - Mr. Herkabe just called.\\
224 - He said you got Cs on your last two tests\\
225 - and you didn't even turn in your history paper.\\
226 - I warned you about this, Malcolm!\\
227 - Mom, this has nothing to do with Sara.\\
228 - I just forgot.\\
229 - I'm doing it now, okay?\\
230 - So, what kind of socks are you wearing?\\
231 - Yeah, I like those.\\
232 - Which shoes are you wearing?\\
233 - Not the sneakers?\\
234 - How about your boots?\\
235 - Your sandals.\\
236 - God, I, like, totally love all your shoes.\\
237 - Yeah, I guess I have homework to do, too.\\
238 - You hang up first.\\
239 - No, you hang...\\
240 - Hello?\\
241 - This is all your fault, Hal.\\
242 - You're the one who bought him that acne medicine.\\
243 - I thought we were safe.\\
244 - I mean, he's still goofy-looking.\\
245 - His head is like five times too big for his body.\\
246 - We shouldn't have to worry about this with Malcolm.\\
247 - He's gifted. He's in genius classes.\\
248 - Girls aren't supposed to be interested in him\\
249 - until he's 28 and a billionaire.\\
250 - Well, certain things are beyond the boy's control, Lois.\\
251 - It's his genetics.\\
252 - The girls, they just swoon.\\
253 - Sorry. What am I telling you for?\\
254 - You battle with it every day.\\
255 - There's nothing we can do.\\
256 - Oh, yes, there is. I can ground him.\\
257 - And I can ground him again.\\
258 - And I can keep on grounding him\\
259 - until he graduates from Harvard.\\
260 - Lois, if we push too hard,\\
261 - he's just going to pull away.\\
262 - And then we'll have another Francis on our hands.\\
263 - Are you blaming Francis on me?\\
264 - What? No!\\
265 - That's what you said.\\
266 - No, I meant that...\\
267 - Lois, please, l-let's... let's not have this veer off\\
268 - into us somehow not having sex tonight.\\
269 - Oh, God!\\
270 - Why do they do this to us?\\
271 - Why can't they learn from their mistakes?\\
272 - Do you think they're just being stupid on purpose?\\
273 - It seems like the only logical conclusion.\\
274 - When they're grown and they have families of their own,\\
275 - we don't have to let them visit, do we?\\
276 - Absolutely not, sweetie.\\
277 - It's just going to be you and me,\\
278 - old and shriveled,\\
279 - alone in a big, empty house,\\
280 - the only sound the gentle sucking of the respirator.\\
281 - And all our money will be sitting in a bank\\
282 - helping no one.\\
283 - You guys seen Sara?\\
284 - No.\\
285 - That's weird.\\
286 - She's two minutes late.\\
287 - Were you supposed to meet her here?\\
288 - Well, no, not exactly.\\
289 - But it was implied.\\
290 - Implied?\\
291 - It's our thing. It's what we do.\\
292 - We meet at the water fountain at 8:00.\\
293 - We're always within 30 seconds\\
294 - of each other in the lunch line,\\
295 - and when I get home every night,\\
296 - I wait four minutes before I call her.\\
297 - That's how it's always been.\\
298 - That's our thing.\\
299 - Wow.\\
300 - I didn't know having a girlfriend was so creepy.\\
301 - It's not creepy!\\
302 - This is totally normal.\\
303 - This is dating.\\
304 - You spend time with each other,\\
305 - get to know each other's habits.\\
306 - When you're in a relationship, you'll understand.\\
307 - But until then, back off.\\
308 - I'll just hang out outside the bathrooms.\\
309 - Hi, Mrs. DeMarco.\\
310 - Sorry to bother you,\\
311 - but the nanny put too much banana in my smoothie.\\
312 - Oh, well, we'll fix that, honey.\\
313 - I just booked the cowboy.\\
314 - He's going to be passing out cowboy hats\\
315 - and making balloon animals.\\
316 - Does he do trick-shooting?\\
317 - Well, if he doesn't,\\
318 - I'm sure we can find someone who does.\\
319 - I bet Ronnie'd like a moonbounce, too.\\
320 - This relationship is finally starting to make sense.\\
321 - For a while, all we did was fight, then make out.\\
322 - Then fight, then make out.\\
323 - But that's all behind us.\\
324 - We were screaming at each other five minutes ago.\\
325 - But now it just feels so right.\\
326 - Wait. What are you doing? Where are you going?\\
327 - Home.\\
328 - We've been kissing for two hours.\\
329 - My face is sore.\\
330 - Yeah, she's right.\\
331 - We can't make out all day.\\
332 - We've both got our own things to do.\\
333 - She's so smart when it comes to these things.\\
334 - If you're seeing someone else, just tell me!\\
335 - What?!\\
336 - I'm sorry.\\
337 - I don't know where that came from.\\
338 - Look, I got to go home.\\
339 - I'll call you tonight.\\
340 - That was pathetic.\\
341 - You were watching us?!\\
342 - Believe me, it's the last time.\\
343 - You know, just because you have a girl\\
344 - doesn't mean you should act like one.\\
345 - I don't know what's wrong with her.\\
346 - She's driving me crazy.\\
347 - I freak out, like, 20 times a day.\\
348 - Dude, you think about everything too much.\\
349 - You just got to calm down, turn off your brain.\\
350 - It's not that easy.\\
351 - Sure, it is. I do it all the time.\\
352 - Watch.\\
353 - You can't just turn off your...\\
354 - Reese?\\
355 - Reese?\\
356 - Whoa...\\
357 - How long was I out?\\
358 - And as I pulled her from the wreckage,\\
359 - she was so disfigured\\
360 - that I didn't even know it was my own sister!\\
361 - Don't worry.\\
362 - Dimitri is the finest\\
363 - reconstructive surgeon in the state.\\
364 - Who's Dimitri?\\
365 - The head of Municipal Hospital.\\
366 - He and Vanessa had an affair last year, then he...\\
367 - Shut up in there!\\
368 - Oh, man, who's got their assignment on Cambodia?\\
369 - I need to borrow it.\\
370 - Where were you... last night?\\
371 - What?\\
372 - The  Space 1999  marathon\\
373 - on the Sci-Fi Channel.\\
374 - I made you a tunic. And a hologram badge.\\
375 - Dabney, I... Forget it!\\
376 - I gave it to my mom's boyfriend.\\
377 - Thanks for nothing.\\
378 - Guys, look, I'm sorry.\\
379 - I've just been...\\
380 - Sara and I were on the phone...\\
381 - Never mind, I'm just sorry.\\
382 - I promise this won't happen again.\\
383 - I think I turned a corner on this thing.\\
384 - Sara and I were talking, and, uh, it just came to me.\\
385 - I think we worked things out.\\
386 - Can you guys excuse me for a second? I'll be right back.\\
387 - He does seem... sorry.\\
388 - I say we cancel our vote of censure.\\
389 - I second that.\\
390 - After all, he was there for us after the Arboretum burnt down.\\
391 - And how can you look in those eyes\\
392 - and say no to anything he asks?\\
393 - I think... he's learned... his lesson.\\
394 - Okay, only two invitations left.\\
395 - Ronnie's going to have a moonbounce\\
396 - and a make-your-own-sundae cart.\\
397 - I'll go.\\
398 - Maybe you will.\\
399 - What kind of present would you bring?\\
400 - Skateboard.\\
401 - Excellent choice.\\
402 - Ronnie already has a brand-new skateboard.\\
403 - Why don't you let me worry about Ronnie?\\
404 - Sit.\\
405 - Look at yourself.\\
406 - They put you on probation.\\
407 - Probation!\\
408 - If you do just\\
409 - one more thing wrong,\\
410 - they're going to kick you out of school!\\
411 - Do you have any idea how serious this is?\\
412 - Is this who you want to be?\\
413 - You want to be some little lapdog\\
414 - who ruins his life for some girl?\\
415 - For God's sake, Malcolm,\\
416 - you beat up a foreign exchange student!\\
417 - Poor little Zadoc\\
418 - left his country to get away from this kind of abuse!\\
419 - Are you even listening to me?\\
420 - Yes, I'm listening!\\
421 - But you know what, Mom? I've got bigger problems!\\
422 - You may not have noticed,\\
423 - but I've been screwing up a lot lately.\\
424 - All because of some stupid girl.\\
425 - I'm on probation!\\
426 - I beat up a kid who doesn't even speak English!\\
427 - I am going through a lot right now,\\
428 - and you don't even care!\\
429 - We can still\\
430 - pull this off.\\
431 - You'll never pass the DNA test, Vanessa.\\
432 - And even your lies aren't going to be enough this time.\\
433 - But, Brock, if you didn't buy the mining rights, then who did?\\
434 - Don't either of you two see what's going on?\\
435 - The person who bought the mining rights\\
436 - is the same person\\
437 - who stole Mrs. Bronson's diamond brooch.\\
438 - And the person who ran Nathaniel's car\\
439 - off the road that night.\\
440 - That person's name is...\\
441 - Okay, you're free to go.\\
442 - Shh! Come on, move it!\\
443 - What? No, no, no! You can't do this to me.\\
444 - Just give me five more minutes!\\
445 - Let's go.\\
446 - Wait! No! hang on!\\
447 - Wait, it was the mayor, right?\\
448 - No, the Widow Farthington!\\
449 - And what about the creepy janitor?\\
450 - Oh, no, no, no!\\
451 - His amnesiac brother!\\
452 - I didn't understand one word\\
453 - that was said in the last six hours.\\
454 - I'm exhausted.\\
455 - I couldn't sleep all night.\\
456 - But I finally figured out what I got to do.\\
457 - Sara, wait up!\\
458 - Look, I've done a lot of thinking,\\
459 - and we need to talk.\\
460 - Sara, this just isn't working.\\
461 - Since I've known you,\\
462 - I've been nothing but obsessive and neurotic\\
463 - and a totally jealous creep who's way too clingy.\\
464 - I don't like what this relationship\\
465 - has turned me into, so...\\
466 - I got you this pager.\\
467 - What? It's perfect.\\
468 - See, now we'll know exactly where the other one is\\
469 - every second of the day. No more worry, no more doubt.\\
470 - We'll finally be able to trust each other.\\
471 - It's perfect.\\
472 - We have to break up, Malcolm.\\
473 - I don't think you heard me.\\
474 - In fact, I'm proposing the exact opposite of that.\\
475 - That's what the pager's for.\\
476 - I'm sorry.\\
477 - Good-bye.\\
478 - No.\\
479 - No! No!\\
480 - Sara!\\
481 - You can't break up with me!\\
482 - Because I am filled with nothing but love and good feelings\\
483 - and no anger and no jealousy.\\
484 - And none of those bad things that will lead to you\\
485 - not wanting to be with me!\\
486 - Okay, fine!\\
487 - Get out of here!\\
488 - I don't need you anyway!\\
489 - I hate your guts!\\
490 - I never needed you!\\
491 - No, no, no, no.\\
492 - I love you!\\
493 - I always have!\\
494 - I always will!\\
495 - We were meant to be together!\\
496 - I gave you my soul, Sara!\\
497 - I gave it to you!\\
498 - My soul!\\
499 - My soul...\\
500 - Sara!\\
501 -     Yippie ki-yay    \\
502 -     Just rolled off his tongue    \\
503 -     That's how the West was won...    \\
504 - MRS. DeMARCO: Here you go, sweetheart.\\
505 - You know, I always thought you hated cookie dough.\\
506 - So, are you having a good time?\\
507 - Yeah, Mom.\\
508 - Thanks.\\
509 - Well, you really should thank Dewey, too.\\
510 - He was a big help in planning all of this.\\
511 - I got you!\\
512 - You're dead!\\
513 - You ruined my birthday!\\
514 - I hate you!\\
515 - I've had two sundaes and four snow cones.\\
516 - Malcolm, let go.\\
517 - Come on, come on.\\
518 - I can't feel my fingers.\\
519 - Hey, I'll go get us some more punch.\\
520 - How does that sound, huh?\\
521 - You know, son, this is all part of growing up.\\
522 - You're just going to have to get used to it.\\
523 - No, I don't.\\
524 - I can go back.\\
525 - I can go back.\\
526 - What are you doing?\\
527 - Playing.\\
528 - I'm going to play.\\
529 - You can't! You're too big.\\
530 - No, I'm not.\\
531 - I'm going back.\\
532 - No.\\
533 - You're too big!\\
534 - You're going to ruin my party!\\
535 - You can't be in here.\\
536 -     Sunny day    \\
537 -     Sweeping the clouds away    \\
538 -     On my way to where the air is sweet...    \\
539 - Okay, don't panic!\\
540 - Okay, okay.\\
541 - Ah.\\
542 - You're okay. Don't be scared!\\
543 - Oh! Don't be afraid, son.\\
544 - It was just a loud explosion.\\
545 - Everything is going to be okay!\\
546 - Don't be afraid anymore.\\
547 - Just once, I'd like to learn a lesson\\
548 - without something exploding.\\
549 -     That's how the West was won.    
\subsection {Episode 05: Charity}
1 - Lois, are you about done in there? No!\\
2 - Well, you're gonna have to get out, I'm late for work.\\
3 - Hal, I am not cutting my shower short\\
4 - because you can't get out of bed in the morning!\\
5 - I can get up just fine\\
6 - if somebody didn't turn off my snooze alarm!\\
7 - That alarm went off every six minutes for an hour!\\
8 - What are you doing?\\
9 - I'm getting in, Lois.\\
10 - You are not!\\
11 - You will get your shower when I'm finished!\\
12 - I don't think I'll be able to come in today.\\
13 - I've got a pretty severe fever,\\
14 - scratchy throat, cough.\\
15 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
16 -     I don't know    \\
17 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     Life is unfair.    \\
27 - No... no... no... wait.\\
28 - No... no...\\
29 - Give me that.\\
30 - No... no... no... wait.\\
31 - No, no...\\
32 - Hi, boys. Got a second?\\
33 - You boys really have a pretty good life.\\
34 - Uh-oh.\\
35 - Spend your days flying kites,\\
36 - playing video games.\\
37 - It's about time you found something to do\\
38 - to enrich your lives.\\
39 - When did we have kites?\\
40 - I could never live with myself\\
41 - if my boys grew up to be selfish little pigs,\\
42 - so I decided to volunteer you\\
43 - to do a little charity work.\\
44 - You can choose between\\
45 - helping old people or helping poor people.\\
46 - Or I can make you do both.\\
47 - Okay, old people.\\
48 - What can be hard about old people?\\
49 - Poor people-- we want poor people.\\
50 - Hi.\\
51 - I'm Francis.\\
52 - Mr. Price said I should see you.\\
53 - Whoo!\\
54 - I can't believe how cold it is up here.\\
55 - Of course, it is Alaska,\\
56 - but still you'd think they could\\
57 - dome the place or put tunnels in between the buildings.\\
58 - So you must know my buddy Eric Hansen?\\
59 - He's the one who set up the logging job for me.\\
60 - Do you give out the axes?\\
61 - 'Cause I'm a lefty, if that makes any difference.\\
62 - What's that?\\
63 - It's a broom, genius.\\
64 - Now grab an apron, sweep out my pantry\\
65 - and quit staring at my bosom.\\
66 - No, you don't understand.\\
67 - Um, I came up here to work as a logger.\\
68 - Let me tell you a little something about loggers.\\
69 - They're filthy, drunken, lowlife swine,\\
70 - and you are their slave.\\
71 - You will feed them, do their laundry,\\
72 - and clean out their privies.\\
73 - You don't steal, you don't back-talk\\
74 - and you don't socialize with the Eskimos.\\
75 - Okay...\\
76 - What'd I say about back-talk?!\\
77 - Eric?\\
78 - Francis?\\
79 - Hey, what's going on?\\
80 - I thought you said...\\
81 - I don't hear sweeping!\\
82 - You boys should be so proud of yourselves.\\
83 - A lot of people are really going to appreciate what you're doing.\\
84 - You know, I'm going to say a special prayer for you.\\
85 - Yeah, that should make us even.\\
86 - Why are we organizing trash?\\
87 - It's not trash, it's stuff that was donated to the poor.\\
88 - Look, Reese, it's just like yours.\\
89 - Yeah, except it's nicer.\\
90 - It doesn't have holes in it.\\
91 - Yeah, well, this jacket is better than yours.\\
92 - You're right.\\
93 - Everything in here is better than our stuff.\\
94 - Ha, ha, you're poor.\\
95 - No wonder I never got a rocket sled.\\
96 - What are you doing? Trading.\\
97 - I'm not sure if you're allow...\\
98 - Think of it this way--\\
99 - I'm making a donation.\\
100 - Instead of one poor person getting a new shirt,\\
101 - now two poor people get one.\\
102 - What's wrong with that?\\
103 - I can't move.\\
104 - Ten hours of scouring deep fat fryers\\
105 - with a 20-minute break to detick sled dogs?\\
106 - What's wrong with that woman?\\
107 - Her name's Lavernia.\\
108 - She controls every facet of your life up here.\\
109 - She finds out\\
110 - what your weakness is\\
111 - and then she gets inside your head\\
112 - and starts working it\\
113 - until she makes you hate yourself.\\
114 - Women.\\
115 - They're just like the woods-- mysterious.\\
116 - Full of wolves.\\
117 - Whoa, Eric, pull it together, man.\\
118 - Could be a lot worse.\\
119 - I mean, at least we're making good money, right?\\
120 - No, we're not.\\
121 - Did you see that ledger book of hers?\\
122 - She charges us for everything\\
123 - and deducts it from our pay.\\
124 - Food, rent, aprons.\\
125 - Hair gel.\\
126 - My first check was for six dollars.\\
127 - Great. Generator's out again.\\
128 - So what are we supposed to do?\\
129 - Just sit around here in the dark?\\
130 - No, this isn't dark.\\
131 - You ever spent the night\\
132 - in a caribou's gut?\\
133 - Who is this old coot?\\
134 - He's my best friend here.\\
135 - It's so nice of your boys to help us out like this.\\
136 - We've always loved this old church.\\
137 - If you cut through the parking lot,\\
138 - you can bypass that traffic light on Sixth.\\
139 - Well...\\
140 - Keep up the good work, boys.\\
141 - All right, I'll be back in two hours,\\
142 - during which time I suggest\\
143 - you think about the horrible...\\
144 - thoughtless...\\
145 - whatever it is you did to deserve this punishment.\\
146 - That's just it-- we didn't do anything.\\
147 - Mom said we needed to build character.\\
148 - Your character, right?\\
149 - Well, see that you do.\\
150 - What are you doing?\\
151 - Trading again--\\
152 - a backpack for a backpack.\\
153 - Dewey, wait.\\
154 - A yo-yo isn't equal to a Game Boy.\\
155 - What if I throw in my Mighty Man?\\
156 - Okay, two toys for one-- seems fair.\\
157 - Yeah, I mean, just as long as what we trade is equal,\\
158 - it seems like...\\
159 - Whoa, check these out.\\
160 - Is this fair?\\
161 - Think of it this way--\\
162 - when you add in the value of the work we're doing,\\
163 - they're still way ahead.\\
164 - Where do you want me to dump this?\\
165 - You don't dump it.\\
166 - You take that bucket, heat it up to 190 degrees,\\
167 - pour it through the hair trap, and make gravy for dinner.\\
168 - You're going to reuse old, filthy fat?\\
169 - You like having a job?!\\
170 - Hey, Lavernia.\\
171 - I need some licorice, some paper towels\\
172 - and a six-pack of beer.\\
173 - Sure, hon.\\
174 - Oh, no.\\
175 - it took me six months\\
176 - to get you paid off last time.\\
177 - I'm off of that book of yours for good.\\
178 - Hard cash.\\
179 - I got it counted out exactly.\\
180 - Good enough.\\
181 - Would you like a freshly-baked muffin?\\
182 - Only eight bucks.\\
183 - You got to be kidding me.\\
184 - Eight bucks for a little...\\
185 - Are those raisins?\\
186 - Last ones till spring.\\
187 - Oh!\\
188 - Quit staring at my caboose!\\
189 - Get back to work!\\
190 - Hey, you know what, you don't have to snarl at us every...\\
191 - God, high school is brutal.\\
192 - They don't care how much homework\\
193 - you have in other classes.\\
194 - They just keep heaping it on.\\
195 - Is Monday okay?\\
196 - Make it Friday-- I don't want to ruin your weekend.\\
197 - Oh, no.\\
198 - I lost the crystal off my watch.\\
199 - Didn't your parents give you that?\\
200 - Yeah.\\
201 - I saw watches like this\\
202 - down at the church.\\
203 - Really? Can you get it for me?\\
204 - Sure-- as long as you donate\\
205 - something of equal or greater value.\\
206 - Okay, how about this aftershave?\\
207 - My mom got it for me\\
208 - for parties and dances.\\
209 - Poor, deluded woman. Sold.\\
210 - You wouldn't believe all the stuff they've got down there.\\
211 - Clothes, toys, comics.\\
212 - Yesterday, a guy dropped off an old Nintendo\\
213 - with a Double Dragon Four game.\\
214 - DD4?\\
215 - The Sacred... Stone?\\
216 - Yeah, why?\\
217 - I'll give you $20 for it.\\
218 - Money?\\
219 - I guess we could put it in the collection box.\\
220 - This is great.\\
221 - The church is only charging five bucks for it.\\
222 - This way we pick it up,\\
223 - Stevie gets the game he wants,\\
224 - and the church gets an extra ten-buck donation.\\
225 - No, the church would get an extra 15 bucks.\\
226 - Well, I think we deserve something for our trouble.\\
227 - Think of it this way--\\
228 - the church is getting three times the money\\
229 - they would otherwise.\\
230 - Yeah, we're making this work for everyone.\\
231 - Any porcelain tea sets?\\
232 - Not for me, of course-- for my sister.\\
233 - Isn't your sister at Vassar?\\
234 - Look, do you want the cash or not?\\
235 - "And my job in Alaska is great.\\
236 - "I'm making tons of money and lots of great friends,\\
237 - "so your dire predictions of me\\
238 - "being miserable and taken advantage of\\
239 - were, as always, dead wrong."\\
240 - Well, he's a good boy, Lois.\\
241 - All our sons are good kids.\\
242 - You know Mrs. Potts down at the church?\\
243 - She says the boys have been a godsend.\\
244 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
245 - Where you boys off to?\\
246 - We told Mrs. Potts we'd be back right after lunch.\\
247 - Charity's fun-- thanks, Mom.\\
248 - Well, what do you know?\\
249 - I finally feel like we're doing something right with those kids.\\
250 -        \\
251 - This is ridiculous.\\
252 - The wolves had me treed for half an hour on the way there.\\
253 - I have just about had... Ow!\\
254 - You can't treat us like this!\\
255 - This isn't human.\\
256 - We're citizens.\\
257 - This is America.\\
258 - Isn't it?\\
259 - I'm sorry, Francis.\\
260 - This is all my fault.\\
261 - Stop crying.\\
262 - It's okay, man.\\
263 - No, it isn't.\\
264 - God, you must hate me.\\
265 - Oh, come on.\\
266 - You're my friend.\\
267 - I can't hate you.\\
268 - (Pete playing "Strangers in the Night" on harmonica)\\
269 - Um, sorry.\\
270 - I thought I was picking up a vibe.\\
271 - Look...\\
272 - Lavernia may be evil\\
273 - and she may be tough,\\
274 - but we're better than her\\
275 - and we can find a way to beat her.\\
276 - How? Our lives are controlled by that ledger book of hers.\\
277 - Everything we do puts us deeper in dept.\\
278 - This is precisely what military school prepared us for.\\
279 - To wage war\\
280 - against all authority no matter what the odds.\\
281 - She may be a cruel, manipulative monster,\\
282 - but Mom can't win every round.\\
283 - Who?\\
284 - Lavernia.\\
285 - We got to get her back even harder.\\
286 - We got to get her where she lives.\\
287 - We got to get that book.\\
288 - I hate that book.\\
289 - You know what book I hate?\\
290 - Valley of the Dolls.\\
291 - What kind of ending was that?\\
292 - Okay, Stevie's looking\\
293 - for some Pam Grier memorabilia\\
294 - if he can keep it here.\\
295 - As long as he's got the money,\\
296 - the church doesn't care.\\
297 - And the guy at the liquor store says\\
298 - he'll take the bread maker.\\
299 - You know what? We're up to $159.\\
300 - What do you think\\
301 - we should do with it?\\
302 - I say we buy a saddle.\\
303 - Once we have the saddle,\\
304 - Mom and Dad can't say no to the horse.\\
305 - I don't want a horse.\\
306 - We all worked for this. I say we vote on what we get.\\
307 - Dewey?\\
308 - Can God see everything we do?\\
309 - What?\\
310 - Mrs. Potts said\\
311 - God sees everything we do.\\
312 - Yeah, Dewey,\\
313 - God can magically see through roofs.\\
314 - What are you\\
315 - worried about?\\
316 - We're not doing anything wrong.\\
317 - Then how come we have money?\\
318 - Well, uh, sometimes when you do good things,\\
319 - good things happen for you.\\
320 - Satisfied?\\
321 - I mean, think of it this way, Dewey,\\
322 - people are still getting the things they need,\\
323 - and, uh, okay, we do have some money,\\
324 - but, uh, the church does, too.\\
325 - So, I mean, no one's really getting hurt, and...\\
326 - This is bad.\\
327 - I say once we get the saddle, we should just quit.\\
328 - We're not getting the saddle.\\
329 - This was a mistake from the beginning.\\
330 - I should have known something was wrong\\
331 - when you started making so much sense.\\
332 - This is your fault.\\
333 - You're the one that's supposed to be smart enough\\
334 - to keep us out of trouble.\\
335 - And that's why you're going to hell.\\
336 - We're all going to hell!\\
337 - You guys\\
338 - seen the remote\\
339 - for...\\
340 - What's going on?\\
341 - Dad, we've done something terrible.\\
342 - It might just be the worst thing we've ever done.\\
343 - All right, just calm down.\\
344 - Let's talk this through.\\
345 - It can't be that bad.\\
346 - You've been stealing money from the church?!\\
347 - And maybe some merchandise.\\
348 - Oh...\\
349 - Oh... you boys have been taking stereos!\\
350 - Toys!\\
351 - Is that cheese?\\
352 - Oh, God.\\
353 - Oh...\\
354 - I need to sit.\\
355 - Ha... oh...\\
356 - Oh, my God.\\
357 - Dewey, get a washcloth.\\
358 - My boys are thieves.\\
359 - Here you go, Dad.\\
360 - Here.\\
361 - Nice and even.\\
362 - You stole air?\\
363 - What is wrong with you boys?!\\
364 - Do you ever stop and think\\
365 - of the consequences of anything that you do?\\
366 - Do you realize the shame\\
367 - that you're going to bring upon\\
368 - our entire family?!\\
369 - Do you?!\\
370 - Forget that. What's Mom going to say?\\
371 - All right, what we're going to do\\
372 - is sneak this stuff back into the church,\\
373 - and no one will ever know this happened. Understood?\\
374 - You know, the church just left us alone with all that stuff.\\
375 - I think it was entrapment.\\
376 - Reese, look, I don't want to hear any more excuses.\\
377 - I'm tired of you boys not taking respons...\\
378 - Oh, damn!\\
379 - It's God!\\
380 - He found us!\\
381 - It's not God, Dewey.\\
382 - It's just my crappy car.\\
383 - Although in a larger sense\\
384 - I suppose he could have helped out my career\\
385 - a bit from time to time.\\
386 - Throw a promotion my way once in a while!\\
387 - So you're right. Maybe it is God!\\
388 - Hey, I don't want to scare anyone,\\
389 - but this is the street Mom takes home from work,\\
390 - and she gets off in ten minutes!\\
391 - Son of a...\\
392 - Geez.\\
393 - Oh...\\
394 - Oh, hey, you, sir.\\
395 - How would you like a shirt?\\
396 - Three shirts and maybe some pants to go with them.\\
397 - What are you, about a 34 waist?\\
398 - What are you doing? I don't want any of these.\\
399 - Why not? They're free!\\
400 - What's wrong with them?\\
401 - Nothing.\\
402 - Oh, for God's sake, just give me five bucks.\\
403 - All right. What's going on here?\\
404 - He's selling me all this stuff for five bucks.\\
405 - Really?\\
406 - Oh, I'll give you five for that little TV.\\
407 - Deal.\\
408 - Okay, all right, gather around!\\
409 - Gather around!\\
410 - I've got a good-as-new stereo system.\\
411 - Who's next?\\
412 - I am.\\
413 - This your stuff?\\
414 - Uh... all right, I know how this must look, Officer,\\
415 - but I can assure you, I didn't steal any of these things.\\
416 - My boys took them from a church.\\
417 - Neither one of you nimrods leave till that grill is spotless.\\
418 - And after you've done that,\\
419 - I want you to get that jar of poison\\
420 - and bait those rat traps.\\
421 - That doesn't make any sense.\\
422 - Why do we need to poison them if we have traps?\\
423 - Because I'll fire your ass.\\
424 - Perfect.\\
425 - Nice job with the tape.\\
426 - Thanks.\\
427 - See, most people put the tape on too tight,\\
428 - so you don't get that realistic clang.\\
429 - Come to Papa.\\
430 - The best part is, everyone hates her so much,\\
431 - she'll never be able to pin this on us.\\
432 - Oh, my God. Look at this next to my name.\\
433 - "Emotionally dependent on pornography.\\
434 - Loves nut clusters."\\
435 - How does she know I love nut clusters?\\
436 - You took the tape off the door!\\
437 - You dragged me to Alaska!\\
438 - Listen, if you do hear from them, please call me.\\
439 - Yes? Hal, you had me worried sick.\\
440 - The police said they released you three hours ago.\\
441 - What's going on?\\
442 - I know by now you've heard everything.\\
443 - I just think it's prudent that the boys and I\\
444 - disappear for a little while.\\
445 - Hal, where are you?\\
446 - I'm afraid that I'm not at liberty to reveal that, Lois.\\
447 - Bus number 23 for Omaha is ready for boarding.\\
448 - Hal, you're a middle-aged man.\\
449 - You can't run away from home.\\
450 - Well, I have a credit card\\
451 - that begs to differ, Lois.\\
452 - Hang up, Dad, she's tracing the call.\\
453 - Don't you dare hang up that phone!\\
454 - Hal, you're not going to do this.\\
455 - You and the boys are going to come home right now.\\
456 - And why would I do that?\\
457 - Because you love me too much to run away.\\
458 - That-that may be true, Lois.\\
459 - But maybe we'll just have to--\\
460 - going to have-have a long- distance relationship\\
461 - for a while.\\
462 - Some-some of those can work.\\
463 - Hal, have you thought for two seconds\\
464 - what your life would be like without me?\\
465 - Well, no, I don't...\\
466 - Do you have any idea how much you'd miss me? Do you?\\
467 - Yes.\\
468 - Yes, yes, I... I have some idea.\\
469 - Dad, you're folding.\\
470 - He's folding!\\
471 - I knew we should have paid that wino\\
472 - to make the call.\\
473 - Uh, honey...\\
474 - we're back.\\
475 - Hey, guys.\\
476 - Why don't you wash up? Dinner's ready.\\
477 - I made your favorite.\\
478 - Meat loaf and mashed potatoes.\\
479 - Okay.\\
480 - Great.\\
481 - Why isn't she mad?\\
482 - What happened?\\
483 - All of our stuff's gone.\\
484 - That's right.\\
485 - I gave it all to charity.\\
486 - You now have two changes of clothes.\\
487 - One for school and one for home.\\
488 - Something wrong?\\
489 - No problem. No, we're fine. No, of course not.\\
490 - More wine?\\
491 - Please.\\
492 - So, how long is it going to take us\\
493 - to work off all this stuff?\\
494 - Well, this...\\
495 - should put us into the 23rd century.\\
496 - Sesame cracker?\\
497 - Hmm, don't mind if I do.\\
498 - I've been lying here, thinking about God.\\
499 - I don't know much--\\
500 - just that he's this all-powerful, all-knowing being.\\
501 - Kind of like Mom, only invisible.\\
502 - So I feel better being on his good side for a while.\\
503 - And you know what?\\
504 - We probably all spend a little too much of our lives\\
505 - focusing on material things.\\
506 - What are you doing?\\
507 - Praying. No, you're not!\\
508 - He's got chocolate! Get him!\\
509 - Come on, give it.
\subsection {Episode 06: Health Scare}
1 - Oh...\\
2 - Aha.\\
3 - Hal, could you replace that light bulb in the kitchen?\\
4 - What does it look like I'm doing?!\\
5 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
6 -     I don't know    \\
7 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     Life is unfair.    \\
17 - Here we are, Bernard.\\
18 - This is my cage.\\
19 - Are you serious?\\
20 - Mom, Dad...\\
21 - This is Bernard.\\
22 - He's the hamster from my class.\\
23 - Remember? It's my weekend to take care of him.\\
24 - Dewey, please. This isn't a good time.\\
25 - I just want you to see how good I could be at taking care him.\\
26 - Just like how good I would be at taking care of a dog.\\
27 - I don't know\\
28 - if I mentioned that all the other kids\\
29 - in the neighborhood have dogs.\\
30 - Honey, your father and I need to talk.\\
31 - I saw a nice one at the pet store.\\
32 - He's half Great Dane and something else.\\
33 - I could name him Jeff and...\\
34 - Go play in your room!\\
35 - Okay.\\
36 - I'll put your cage right here, Bernard.\\
37 - Sorry I talked about wanting a dog in front of you.\\
38 - Is your brain big enough to get your feelings hurt?\\
39 - Me neither.\\
40 - But don't worry, I'll still take really good care of you.\\
41 - Bernard?\\
42 - But, Hal, I thought you were just getting a routine check-up.\\
43 - That's when they usually find these things.\\
44 - Can't they do anything?\\
45 - No, not until they get the biopsy back.\\
46 - There you are.\\
47 - You can't call that a shortcut!\\
48 - A shortcut has to be shorter!\\
49 - Says who?\\
50 - Says the word!\\
51 - No, a shortcut is just when you don't use regular streets.\\
52 - So, according to you,\\
53 - if it took 150 years to cross the street,\\
54 - just as long as you went through some bushes and trees,\\
55 - that would qualify as a shortcut?\\
56 - God, you hate being wrong.\\
57 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\\
58 - What is wrong with you?!\\
59 - Look at that floor!\\
60 - Oh, sorry.\\
61 - How many times have I told you\\
62 - don't track mud into this house?!\\
63 - We'll clean it up.\\
64 - That's not good enough!\\
65 - You're grounded for a week!\\
66 - What?! You can't do that.\\
67 - It's just some stupid footprints.\\
68 - You want to be grounded for two weeks?\\
69 - Dad?\\
70 - You heard your mother!\\
71 - This is ridiculous!\\
72 - You're being totally unfair!\\
73 - Just because Malcolm got mud on his shoes\\
74 - and thoughtlessly tracked it through the house\\
75 - doesn't mean he should be grounded.\\
76 - Go to your room. Now!\\
77 - What is her problem?\\
78 - Mom and Dad-- their lives are so boring\\
79 - they have to invent stuff to be upset about.\\
80 - Are you the biggest idiot to ever walk this Earth?\\
81 - Good morning.\\
82 - What'd I tell you to do, jackass?\\
83 - To paint the kitchen. Which I'm doing.\\
84 - What kind of a moron paints a kitchen white?\\
85 - You want to see all the dirt?\\
86 - What do they teach you in college, anyway?\\
87 - For your information, I'm a high school dropout.\\
88 - And I used the paint that you set out for me.\\
89 - I moved that paint\\
90 - so you could get to the green, idiot.\\
91 - Now, you're going to do this over.\\
92 - I don't care if you're here all night doing it.\\
93 - What?! That paint you wasted\\
94 - is coming out of your pay.\\
95 - Maybe I should\\
96 - just paint it the same color as your dye job.\\
97 - What?\\
98 - He didn't say anything.\\
99 - I said...\\
100 - maybe I should just paint it the same color as your dye job,\\
101 - you sagging, leathery, hatchet-faced,\\
102 - dried-up old hag.\\
103 - All right, college boy,\\
104 - you want it, you got it.\\
105 - I'm going to kick your ass.\\
106 - Excuse me?\\
107 - I'm kicking your ass.\\
108 - You don't ever disrespect me like that.\\
109 - Francis, what are you doing?\\
110 - You can't challenge Lavernia to a fight.\\
111 - I didn't challenge anybody.\\
112 - Hey, Lavernia's fighting college boy!\\
113 - We got an opening\\
114 - Sunday at 2:00 before Mass.\\
115 - Sunday, 2:00-- your ass, my foot.\\
116 - This is insane.\\
117 - There's no way I'm going to fight a woman.\\
118 - If I don't mind, why should you?\\
119 - Did you see what she did there?\\
120 - She as much as called him a woman.\\
121 - It's going to be a bloodbath.\\
122 - Yeah, you're right, Dewey.\\
123 - When was the last time we played ball?\\
124 - I don't know.\\
125 - Sometimes life just gets away from you\\
126 - and you forget the things that are really important.\\
127 - This is crazy.\\
128 - I have enough on my mind\\
129 - without worrying about you boys and your shenanigans.\\
130 - But, Mom... You and your brother are not to leave this room.\\
131 - I don't want to see you, I don't want to hear you,\\
132 - I don't want to so much as sense your presence...\\
133 - For crying out loud, Reese!\\
134 - There's a mirror right there!\\
135 - Believe me, I am going to watch that door like a hawk.\\
136 - What's her problem?\\
137 - This can't just be about the mud.\\
138 - There's something else going on.\\
139 - What have you done lately?\\
140 - The Richardsons' fire, the Blodgets' windshield,\\
141 - the Sampsons' fire, the Jacksons' fire.\\
142 - Nothing she knows about.\\
143 - This sucks.\\
144 - Well, if you can't do the time, then don't do the crime.\\
145 - See you Monday.\\
146 - Hey, moron.\\
147 - Do you know what tomorrow night is?\\
148 - Christine Maxton's party.\\
149 - What? That's this weekend?\\
150 - Yeah, and her sister Gina's bringing all their friends\\
151 - from Catholic school.\\
152 - I love those girls.\\
153 - I hear they tongue kiss\\
154 - whether they like you or not.\\
155 - It's like shaking hands to them.\\
156 - It's some kind of cultural thing.\\
157 - We have to go.\\
158 - Reese, if I show you a way we can go to the party,\\
159 - do you promise never to let anyone find out,\\
160 - even though you're an idiot?\\
161 - I swear.\\
162 - Okay.\\
163 - I was saving this for a life-or-death emergency.\\
164 - Or a really, really good party.\\
165 - Tell me!\\
166 - No way. I'm not hitting Mom with that.\\
167 - Reese, tomorrow night, after everyone's gone to bed,\\
168 - we take out the floorboard\\
169 - and sneak outside through the crawl space.\\
170 - Wow. Tunneling out of our own room.\\
171 - She can't lock us in anymore.\\
172 - Mom's powerless.\\
173 - Yeah, now she's just a crazy old lady\\
174 - we happen to live with.\\
175 - Thanks, Dewey!\\
176 - There's Dewey. Let's hurt him, fellow idiot.\\
177 - Yes, I hate him for his handsomeness.\\
178 - Hi, Dewey.\\
179 - Hi, Lance.\\
180 - Well, what do you know.\\
181 - It's Bernard.\\
182 - Let me see him.\\
183 - You can't have him.\\
184 - That's all right, I can wait.\\
185 - Next week is my turn to have him.\\
186 - We're going to have a lot of fun.\\
187 - You cannot keep the hamster.\\
188 - He belongs to the class.\\
189 - But he won't be safe. Dewey, I know you take\\
190 - good care of him, but you have to share him\\
191 - with your friends.\\
192 - Lance is not my friend.\\
193 - He tore Billy's shirt off after school, and...\\
194 - Hello! Yes, this is he!\\
195 - He killed a frog and brought it\\
196 - to school and showed everybody.\\
197 - Dewey, I said no!\\
198 - Do you want to be grounded like your brothers?\\
199 - No.\\
200 - Man, I've never seen Lavernia this worked up for a fight.\\
201 - You mean she's done this before?\\
202 - In the two months I've been here,\\
203 - she's fought five guys. Consider yourself lucky\\
204 - you got some warning.\\
205 - You know Big Don from accounting?\\
206 - The guy with one ear?\\
207 - Yeah. He was going to the privy,\\
208 - and she dropped on him just like a spider.\\
209 - What is wrong with her?!\\
210 - We were just having a stupid little argument.\\
211 - How did it suddenly turn into a fight?\\
212 - That's how we settle things up there.\\
213 - There are three other fights scheduled for tomorrow.\\
214 - Four.\\
215 - Ned cut in front of Daryl at the mess line.\\
216 - Well, I hate to disappoint you guys,\\
217 - but I'm not fighting Lavernia.\\
218 - Really?\\
219 - Are you sure?\\
220 - No, no, he'll fight her.\\
221 - No, I won't.\\
222 - Thank you!\\
223 - Hey, fellas, looks like\\
224 - we're going to have us a coward's cotillion!\\
225 - I'll get the dogs ready.\\
226 - I'll sharpen the pig-sticker.\\
227 - Wait-wait-wait. What are you talking about?\\
228 - Look, fighting's the only entertainment we get up here.\\
229 - You've seen our TV reception.\\
230 - So if somebody cheats the boys out of a fight,\\
231 - they have a coward's cotillion.\\
232 - What the hell is a coward's cotillion?!\\
233 - Oh, it's always a little different.\\
234 - You never know what kind of animal\\
235 - the blood's going to attract.\\
236 - So my choices are, I have to fight a woman\\
237 - or do this stupid cotillion thing?\\
238 - Well...\\
239 - there's always the howdy stranger.\\
240 - How can they make us wait another 24 hours?\\
241 - Apparently they're shorthanded at the lab.\\
242 - Don't they realize this is someone's life?\\
243 - Don't worry, Bernard.\\
244 - This is for the best.\\
245 - I'm setting you free.\\
246 - You won't have to worry\\
247 - about anyone being mean to you anymore.\\
248 - Come on, Bernard, run.\\
249 - Run like the wind.\\
250 - You have to do this, Bernard.\\
251 - It's for your own good.\\
252 - I'll be okay.\\
253 - Go on.\\
254 - I don't want you anymore.\\
255 - I don't like you.\\
256 - I never did.\\
257 - Go on.\\
258 - Go on, you dumb old hamster.\\
259 - Bye, Bernard.\\
260 - Booby-trapped?\\
261 - A broom handle tied to a string of tin cans.\\
262 - A classic.\\
263 - You know, if Mom ever trusted us,\\
264 - I think she'd be pleasantly surprised.\\
265 - Yeah, we're basically good kids.\\
266 - She's so unreasonable.\\
267 - You almost ready?\\
268 - Just a sec.\\
269 - Will you come on?\\
270 - Remember, if anyone asks, I'm a junior in college.\\
271 - My boys.\\
272 - You don't know how lucky you are.\\
273 - Everything is new.\\
274 - Everything is open to you.\\
275 - Please don't ever take that for granted.\\
276 - Make every moment the best you possibly can.\\
277 - God, I am so proud of all of you.\\
278 - You kids are the best thing I've ever done.\\
279 - You'll never know how much I love you.\\
280 - Maybe you're not supposed to.\\
281 - Sleep well, my little angels.\\
282 - This was amazing.\\
283 - I made out with a sophomore.\\
284 - I am so far ahead of schedule.\\
285 - Did you see the TV set fly off the roof into the pool?\\
286 - That was me.\\
287 - Man, I hope we get grounded next weekend.\\
288 - How dare you?!\\
289 - How dare you defy us like that?!\\
290 - Well, we wouldn't have had to if you hadn't been\\
291 - ridiculously hard over a little mud on the floor!\\
292 - You two are the most ungrateful,\\
293 - badly-behaved, inconsiderate boys ever born!\\
294 - How could you be so heartless?!\\
295 - What is heartless about going to a party\\
296 - with a bunch of slutty girls?\\
297 - Be cool.\\
298 - You were at a party?\\
299 - While we were here worrying?!\\
300 - Can I have a napkin?\\
301 - I cannot believe you two!\\
302 - All right, that's it!\\
303 - You are grounded for the rest of the school year!\\
304 - You can't do that!\\
305 - You're crazy!\\
306 - You do not talk to your mother that way ever!\\
307 - You will show her nothing but the love\\
308 - and respect she deserves, whether I am here or not!\\
309 - This family sucks!\\
310 - You are ruining our lives!\\
311 - I wish you were dead!\\
312 - What was that all about?\\
313 - I don't know.\\
314 - She usually just says, "I'm taking you with me."\\
315 - Lavernia, I want to tell you something.\\
316 - We'll talk at 2:00.\\
317 - No, I'm going to tell you this right now.\\
318 - I hate your guts.\\
319 - You are the most horrible person\\
320 - I have ever met.\\
321 - You are mean, sadistic, twisted and spiteful.\\
322 - And I owe you an apology.\\
323 - Because what I said to you\\
324 - didn't have anything to do with that;\\
325 - it was just a cheap shot about your looks\\
326 - and you don't deserve that-- no one deserves that.\\
327 - You're right.\\
328 - Thank you.\\
329 - What the hell are we doing this for, anyway?\\
330 - This isn't going to solve anything.\\
331 - We're just putting on a show for bunch of slack-jawed idiots.\\
332 - I don't know if you think you have to prove something to them\\
333 - because you're a woman, but you don't.\\
334 - You came up here all alone\\
335 - and you built a successful business\\
336 - in this god-awful place.\\
337 - You have accomplished plenty.\\
338 - Oh, my God.\\
339 - You're coming on to me.\\
340 - What?\\
341 - Well, you better peddle your sugar\\
342 - to somebody else, 'cause this bee ain't buying.\\
343 - What?!\\
344 - The last thing I need\\
345 - is some young punk frolicking in my nethers.\\
346 - You don't listen to...\\
347 - I try to talk to you...\\
348 - Ew!\\
349 - Do you hear anything?\\
350 - Mom's still crying.\\
351 - Did she ever go to sleep?\\
352 - Around 3:00, she went from sobbing to a quiet whimper.\\
353 - I'm telling you, she's just trying to psych us out.\\
354 - I don't think so.\\
355 - I mean, when was the last time\\
356 - you heard Dad yell and Mom cry?\\
357 - You're right.\\
358 - Something really weird is going on.\\
359 - They've been whispering a lot, too.\\
360 - I just figured it out.\\
361 - Oh, no... oh, no!\\
362 - Come on. Come on.\\
363 - Big hit. Big hit. Oh, come on.\\
364 - I've never seen her like this.\\
365 - What do you expect?\\
366 - The boy tried to jump in bed with her\\
367 - without so much as a "howdy-do."\\
368 - Dude, she's killing you.\\
369 - Do something.\\
370 - I will not hit a woman.\\
371 - Well, then here, take this.\\
372 - What is it? Screwdriver.\\
373 - Jab and twist.\\
374 - I'm not using a screw...\\
375 - Fight... back.\\
376 - Fight...\\
377 - back!\\
378 - Lavernia, ease up on the boy.\\
379 - His only crime was loving you.\\
380 - You disgust me.\\
381 - You better run home to mama\\
382 - so she can kiss your tears away\\
383 - and make you cocoa and tell you...\\
384 - For your information,\\
385 - my mother's a tormenting control freak,\\
386 - and it would never even occur to her to make me cocoa.\\
387 - You're going down, college boy.\\
388 - Bring it on, you toad.\\
389 - Ed, Daryl, you're up.\\
390 - Somebody help me clear this floor.\\
391 - All right, I'll get the camera.\\
392 - Remember, if anyone at school asks,\\
393 - you're name's Bernard.\\
394 - You like carrots and having your tummy scratched.\\
395 - Well, I need to know.\\
396 - No. We have been waiting for hours.\\
397 - Now, please...\\
398 - Negative?! Negative!\\
399 - That's the good one, right?\\
400 - Yes! Thank you. Oh, God.\\
401 - If Mom does a load of blankets, I'll bring you a friend.\\
402 - Mom, Dad, we have something to say.\\
403 - We know why you've been crying so much lately.\\
404 - You don't have to protect us from this.\\
405 - We think getting a divorce is a great idea.\\
406 - What? You don't have to stay\\
407 - together for us-- we've known for years\\
408 - your marriage was a sham.\\
409 - I mean, clearly\\
410 - your relationship isn't working.\\
411 - Mom, you need someone who's going to control you better.\\
412 - And Dad needs someone younger.\\
413 - You both deserve some happiness.\\
414 - In fact, I think we all do.\\
415 - Amen to that.\\
416 - So I guess we should be going\\
417 - to a motel with Dad or something?\\
418 - Our bags are packed.\\
419 - And don't worry, Mom,\\
420 - you'll still be part of our lives.\\
421 - We'll see you every other weekend,\\
422 - and feel free to call us anytime.\\
423 - We've already discussed it.\\
424 - I get full custody.
\subsection {Episode 07: Christmas}
1 - Reese's had the remote for four hours.\\
2 - That's four hours of mindless crap in five-second increments.\\
3 - You go to the bathroom, you lose the remote.\\
4 - Fine.\\
5 - I can wait.\\
6 - I don't know.\\
7 - You drank a lot of soda... it must really be pushing\\
8 - up against the walls of your bladder.\\
9 - Not going to work.\\
10 - And then, I had four glasses of Dad's iced tea.\\
11 - He just kept pouring... and pouring...\\
12 - Not going to work.\\
13 - The equivalent of three semi trailers of water\\
14 - pour over the falls every second.\\
15 - Not going to work.\\
16 - (slurping noisily, Reese groaning)\\
17 - Not... going to.... work!\\
18 - Turns out this is way better than anything on TV.\\
19 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
20 -     I don't know    \\
21 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - All right.\\
31 - Turn it.\\
32 - Turn it. Turn it.\\
33 - No! Too far. Go back.\\
34 - Back, back, back, back back, back, back...\\
35 - Right there, there, there, there. There.\\
36 - Okay, just three more inches clockwise.\\
37 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.\\
38 - Okay, back a couple degrees... couple degrees\\
39 - And keep 'er steady.\\
40 - Steady... yeah!\\
41 - There. Perfect.\\
42 - Oh.\\
43 - These needles here are going against the grain.\\
44 - That's all I'm going to be able to look at.\\
45 - Don't move.\\
46 - Just spend a couple of days with Grandma.\\
47 - You can leave right after Christmas.\\
48 - I am not visiting that woman.\\
49 - She's evil and she hates me.\\
50 - Francis, this is family.\\
51 - This is Grandma's first Christmas since Grandpa died\\
52 - and you live the closest.\\
53 - How can you be so selfish?\\
54 - Well, did you invite her to your house?\\
55 - She knows she's always welcome.\\
56 - Hey, maybe we'll both get on a bus\\
57 - and come down and surprise you.\\
58 - Don't you threaten me.\\
59 - I am ending this discussion.\\
60 - You are going to Whitehorse.\\
61 - You are going to the drugstore\\
62 - to buy her a gift, and you are both\\
63 - going to have a proper Christmas.\\
64 - Aw, look at the little baby!\\
65 - I hate you!\\
66 - Get this off of me, you stupid son of a...\\
67 - Boys!\\
68 - Dewey asked us to do it.\\
69 - What is wrong with you?\\
70 - The tree is barely\\
71 - in the door and already you're starting.\\
72 - I can't leave you alone for even one second\\
73 - without you trying to kill each other.\\
74 - This is supposed to be a happy time!\\
75 - I don't know what it is\\
76 - but Mom freaks out about something every Christmas.\\
77 -     Buon natale, a Merry Christmas to you...    \\
78 - Ho-ho-ho!\\
79 -      Buon natale  to everyone    \\
80 -     Happy New Year and lots of fun    \\
81 -      Buon natale     \\
82 -     May all your wishes come true    \\
83 -      Buon natale  to Italy    \\
84 -     Means a Merry Christmas    \\
85 -     To you!     Who did this?! Who did this?!\\
86 - Drop and roll, honey.\\
87 - Who did this?\\
88 - For God's sakes, drop and roll!\\
89 - Maybe it's lack of sunlight in the winter.\\
90 - I heard that messes up some people's brains.\\
91 - Hi, Grandma.\\
92 - For God's sakes, it's colder in here.\\
93 - Don't you turn the heat on?\\
94 - I'm not going to pay those pirates.\\
95 - Of course not.\\
96 - Well, in the spirit of the season,\\
97 - let's begin this pathetic charade.\\
98 - I never know what you're talking about.\\
99 - You talk like a jackass.\\
100 - You do this to torture me?\\
101 - To hurt me?\\
102 - You don't like Christmas music?\\
103 - It sounds like a song they sang\\
104 - when they would ride through the villages\\
105 - and throw the babies into the fire.\\
106 - They sang "Jingle Bells"?\\
107 - They sang something.\\
108 - Well, look at that-- 8:00 already, way past my bedtime.\\
109 - Where do I sleep?\\
110 - You're sitting on it.\\
111 - Does it turn into a bed?\\
112 - Yes, it becomes a bed.\\
113 - It's a special, magic sofa.\\
114 - It opens up for magic, lazy boy\\
115 - and angels come and feed you grapes\\
116 - and sing to you while you sleep\\
117 - and it flies around the room granting wishes\\
118 - for boys what are stupid.\\
119 - All right! It doesn't fold out.\\
120 - Can I look yet?\\
121 - Just a minute.\\
122 - Hey, this is supposed to be to Dewey from both of us.\\
123 - I picked it out.\\
124 - I stepped in it.\\
125 - Hey!\\
126 - Hey...\\
127 -        \\
128 - Gotcha!\\
129 - -Uh, Mom.\\
130 - How nice to see you home.\\
131 - I have had it!\\
132 - What are you doing?\\
133 - I am taking everything.\\
134 - Every present,\\
135 - every decoration, every treat.\\
136 - I am locking it in the garage.\\
137 - Every single Christmas you scream or burn\\
138 - or break or destroy, and I am putting a stop to it!\\
139 - She's stealing Christmas!\\
140 - Mom, you can't do this!\\
141 - Yeah, this is the last year\\
142 - Dewey will believe in Santa Claus.\\
143 - What?!\\
144 - If you boys behave\\
145 - until Christmas morning\\
146 - there will be a Christmas morning.\\
147 - Otherwise, these are going back to the store\\
148 - and Christmas will be canceled!\\
149 - You wouldn't cancel Christmas.\\
150 - You're bluffing.\\
151 - You canceled Christmas?!\\
152 - I'm not canceling Christmas.\\
153 - I'm holding it hostage.\\
154 - I know, it seems harsh,\\
155 - but nothing else has ever worked.\\
156 - Every year, we yell\\
157 - we threaten, we bargain, we beg.\\
158 - Maybe this time they'll behave.\\
159 - We're in this together.\\
160 - I'm playing the unity card.\\
161 - But... The unity card, Hal.\\
162 - But...\\
163 - I love Christmas.\\
164 - I know you do, dear.\\
165 - Isn't there anything that trumps the unity card?\\
166 - Hal...\\
167 - I really think we can win this 'Nam thing.\\
168 - Hey, that's not for you.\\
169 - That's for the carolers.\\
170 - You're ruining smoking for me.\\
171 - You sound like you're dying.\\
172 - You'd like that, wouldn't you?\\
173 - You can't wait to get your hands on my things.\\
174 - Oh, yeah, Grandma, I got big plans for these doilies\\
175 - and I really want that can of peaches\\
176 - that's been on your shelf for 30 years.\\
177 - Don't touch my peaches.\\
178 - Oh, like I'm really going to touch...\\
179 - (carolers singing "Carol of the Bells")\\
180 - Stop your racket!\\
181 - Decent people are trying to sleep!\\
182 - You stupid music!\\
183 - There is no figgy pudding for you here!\\
184 - Please pass the syrup, please.\\
185 - Thank you.\\
186 - You are very welcome.\\
187 - More coffee? Please.\\
188 - I'll get it for you, Mom. That's okay.\\
189 - Well, then, I hope you'll let us wash the dishes.\\
190 - We'd love to! Absolutely!\\
191 - Now, that, I'll take you up on.\\
192 - I think we can do this.\\
193 - It's Christmas Eve, and we've behaved for ten hours.\\
194 - Okay, eight were sleep, but still.\\
195 - We can make it through another 24, right?\\
196 - Who wants the last waffle?\\
197 - I do!\\
198 - Oh, no!\\
199 - You know, I would really\\
200 - like that waffle.\\
201 - Yes, but I am a growing boy.\\
202 - Perhaps it would be best if I had the waffle.\\
203 - Thanks for offering it to me, boys.\\
204 - They are such good boys.\\
205 - (accordion music playing over TV)\\
206 - Ow!\\
207 - God, what the hell is wrong with you?\\
208 - You like pushing me?\\
209 - That's what happens when you push, big, tough guy.\\
210 - Can't you do the entire family a favor and just die?!\\
211 - All you have ever done is treat us like dirt!\\
212 - You shouldn't even be allowed to be a grandma.\\
213 - Are you finished?\\
214 - Yes, I am...\\
215 - Oh, I am so sorry.\\
216 - Oh...\\
217 - I should have kissed your boo-boos and made them better.\\
218 - I was supposed to tell\\
219 - the bad little boy stories\\
220 - and bake you giant sugar cookies\\
221 - and knit you nice, fluffy sweaters.\\
222 - I should have carried you and held you\\
223 - and told you how much I loved your diapers.\\
224 - Why don't you just unhinge your jaw and finish me off?\\
225 - After my  Magnum, P.I.\\
226 - Lois! I'm home!\\
227 - Now, honey,\\
228 - I know I'm not supposed to do this\\
229 - but I saw something in the store today\\
230 - and I had to get it for you.\\
231 - It's a little more than\\
232 - we agreed we would spend on each other\\
233 - but I figured hey, it's Christmas.\\
234 - We have the whole rest of the year to follow the rules.\\
235 - It's beautiful.\\
236 - I mean, isn't that what this season is all about?\\
237 - You know, relaxing, enjoying things, making people happy?\\
238 - Hal, that's so sweet and thoughtful.\\
239 - I hope I get to open it.\\
240 - Rats!\\
241 - You're doing it all wrong.\\
242 - You have seven ornaments.\\
243 - I'm putting them on your tree.\\
244 - How could I do it wrong?\\
245 - Go get the angel off mantel.\\
246 - Who's this?\\
247 - That is your grandfather, when he was young man.\\
248 - Ugh! Tell me that eyebrow thing isn't genetic.\\
249 - You and him-- both the same.\\
250 - Always had to have your own way;\\
251 - nothing ever good enough.\\
252 - Always have to fight everything.\\
253 - Victor always had to be so independent.\\
254 - Left home when he was 11, lived on his own.\\
255 - Got work on a farm\\
256 - plowing the fields, like a man.\\
257 - Worked 18 hours a day.\\
258 - Had to sleep with the pigs\\
259 - but he never complained.\\
260 - He was strong.\\
261 - He made something of himself.\\
262 - Nobody's like that anymore.\\
263 - Everybody's too soft.\\
264 - Hey, Grandma, why don't you let me help you with that?\\
265 - Your grandfather was tough.\\
266 - He didn't take anything from anybody.\\
267 - He was... proud.\\
268 - A man of... honor.\\
269 - He was a wonderful...\\
270 - wonderful man.\\
271 - Victor...\\
272 - du kaya mischna...\\
273 - Grandma?\\
274 - Grandma?\\
275 - Oh!\\
276 - Oh, God!\\
277 - Ugh!\\
278 - Just one more night.\\
279 - We can get through one night.\\
280 - We should be proud of ourselves.\\
281 - Everything's put away.\\
282 - We haven't had a single fight.\\
283 - We did it.\\
284 - We're going to get presents?\\
285 - We're going to get presents.\\
286 - What do we do now?\\
287 - I guess we could take a nap.\\
288 - Or maybe play quietly--\\
289 - very quietly.\\
290 - Shut up, Petey, shut up!\\
291 - God, I'll be so glad when Christmas is over.\\
292 - Yeah, we'll be safe for another year.\\
293 - Mom's doing this next Christmas?\\
294 - Why wouldn't she?\\
295 - It worked, didn't it?\\
296 - And what if it's not just Christmas?\\
297 - What do you mean?\\
298 - What if she does it for other things\\
299 - like Halloween or Fourth of July?\\
300 - Or our birthdays?\\
301 - She can't do this!\\
302 - I can't take it anymore.\\
303 - We have to do something to stop her.\\
304 - Something drastic.\\
305 - I'm in.\\
306 - Mom needs to know\\
307 - she can't take special occasions hostage.\\
308 - She needs to know we don't negotiate.\\
309 - She turned a beautiful family holiday\\
310 - into a nightmare.\\
311 - It's time we show her the true spirit of Christmas.\\
312 - Now, before you say anything, I don't want you\\
313 - to think of this as Christmas cider.\\
314 - This is nondenominational "winter" cider.\\
315 - Though the boys are doing so well, I...\\
316 - Lois?\\
317 - I'm a terrible mother.\\
318 - I shouldn't be allowed to have children.\\
319 - Oh, sweetie...\\
320 - I ruined Christmas.\\
321 - What do you mean?\\
322 - The boys are behaving like I never knew they could behave.\\
323 - I thought that's what you wanted.\\
324 - Yeah, but I didn't want it like this.\\
325 - I wanted to take it back five minutes\\
326 - after I starting grabbing those presents,\\
327 - but I didn't know how.\\
328 - I'm a monster.\\
329 - No, no, you're not monster.\\
330 - I am. I really am.\\
331 - No, you're not a monster.\\
332 - Why don't you just admit I'm a monster!\\
333 - All right, in this particular case,\\
334 - you're a monster.\\
335 - I know.\\
336 - Just let the machine get it.\\
337 - Come on, you know how when you cry it makes me cry.\\
338 - You are a wonderful mother.\\
339 - And you're a wonderful person.\\
340 - Hey, Mom, it's Francis.\\
341 - I just want you to know that I am disgusted\\
342 - with the way you treat Grandma.\\
343 - Abandoning a helpless old woman at Christmas.\\
344 - I hope you're ashamed of yourself.\\
345 - I am. I am.\\
346 - Hal, the boys don't deserve this.\\
347 - I mean, they're a little high-spirited\\
348 - but they're good, good boys.\\
349 - God, this feels so right.\\
350 - This is way better than real Christmas.\\
351 - Remember, mess them up just enough\\
352 - so mom can't return them.\\
353 - Wait a minute.\\
354 - Mom got me the exact video game I asked for.\\
355 - These are better than what I asked for.\\
356 - You know what?\\
357 - Mom got me everything I wanted.\\
358 - Me, too.\\
359 - She listened to us.\\
360 - Okay, so she got lucky a few times.\\
361 - I never asked for a stupid globe.\\
362 - That's mine.\\
363 - The cleats are yours.\\
364 - Oh.\\
365 - Mom really tried this year.\\
366 - All she wanted was a nice Christmas\\
367 - and we ruined it.\\
368 - In all fairness, we ruin everything.\\
369 - Remember how happy we were a minute ago?\\
370 - How do we go back?\\
371 - I don't know.\\
372 - Do we have any paint left?\\
373 - No.\\
374 - Oh, well.\\
375 - What are you doing?\\
376 - I'm doing you a favor,\\
377 - so why don't you shut up and enjoy it.\\
378 - What is this?\\
379 - Oh, you don't want to look in there.\\
380 - It's too sad.\\
381 - No, Grandma,\\
382 - what are all these things?\\
383 - I mean, look at this.\\
384 - There must be, like, a thousand dollars worth of stuff in here.\\
385 - $2,735.\\
386 - $4,500 Canadian.\\
387 - What are they doing in your closet?\\
388 - They're gifts.\\
389 - For the family, for relatives, for friends.\\
390 - But you never give presents. You...\\
391 - Oh, my God, Donatello with pizza-throwing action.\\
392 - I wanted one of these when I was six.\\
393 - I know you did. I bought that for you.\\
394 - No, you didn't.\\
395 - Yes, I did.\\
396 - And then, right before Christmas,\\
397 - your Mommy put you on the phone\\
398 - you called me "poopie" and hung up.\\
399 - Is that the bread maker Mom was asking for last year?\\
400 - If she wants bread so much\\
401 - she should write back\\
402 - when her mother writes to her.\\
403 - Oh, this was for Cousin Nikola.\\
404 - I spent a day shopping for it.\\
405 - Then she marries a Protestant.\\
406 - That camera, for your father,\\
407 - right before he refused to drive me to the liquor store-- ugh!\\
408 - All the nice things I do for people.\\
409 - Oh, my God, you're crazy!\\
410 - I just thought you were evil, but you are nuts!\\
411 - What are you talking about?\\
412 - Gifts aren't conditional-- they're gifts!\\
413 - You give them to people because you love them.\\
414 - They're not something you can take away\\
415 - because of some petty slight.\\
416 - You're not teaching people anything.\\
417 - You haven't gotten back at them.\\
418 - They don't even know they've upset you.\\
419 - All you have done here is-is...\\
420 - constructed a monument to your own insanity!\\
421 - What kind of a person does that?!\\
422 - A lonely...\\
423 - bitter... old woman.\\
424 - What?!\\
425 - Look what I've done.\\
426 - What use is all these things to me now?\\
427 - They could have brought someone some happiness;\\
428 - instead, they rot here.\\
429 - Grandma? My hea... heart.\\
430 - I... I think it's melting.\\
431 - Yes... it's melting.\\
432 - Oh... you showed me the way...\\
433 - Francis, by yelling at me.\\
434 - Quick, go get my magic sled\\
435 - and me and my reindeers will go and give Christmas\\
436 - to all the mean, stupid, rude people.\\
437 - We'll all join hands and sing songs.\\
438 - And we'll sprinkle\\
439 - the ingrates with fairy dust\\
440 - and my...\\
441 - Are you sure you want to do this?\\
442 - Yes. I don't know what I was thinking;\\
443 - taking presents away from children?\\
444 - What kind of a sick person does that?\\
445 - Look, I just want to get everything out of the garage\\
446 - set it up in the house, and have a nice Christmas.\\
447 - You know what?\\
448 - Why don't we wake up the boys and have Christmas tonight?\\
449 - I can't wait to see the look on their sweet little faces.\\
450 - Well, Hal, that was...\\
451 - smart of you to wake up the boys\\
452 - so they could help us carry in the presents.\\
453 - Yes... yes... uh...\\
454 - well, come on, come on, hurry up, boys.\\
455 - Yeah. Sure. Okay.\\
456 - I'll cut off his hands and stick them in his kakooshnyik.\\
457 - (another musical card starts playing in distance)\\
458 - Yoric greblech!\\
459 - Roller skates!\\
460 - Oh, I hope you like them, sweetie.\\
461 - Ooh, I think we have another present here for Reese.\\
462 - I wonder what it is.\\
463 - This really is the best Christmas we've ever had.\\
464 - I don't know why we didn't try\\
465 - this whole denial thing a long time ago.\\
466 -      Buon natale  to you!    
\subsection {Episode 08: Poker}
1 - Oh, with the boys asleep this house is so quiet.\\
2 - Mm-hmm.\\
3 - Such a nice idea to build a fire.\\
4 - Yeah.\\
5 - Hey, I didn't build the fire.\\
6 - I thought you built the fire.\\
7 - Well, looks like Reese got a "D" in English.\\
8 - And Dewey seems to be fighting again.\\
9 - Biting.\\
10 - Oh, Malcolm, tell your teacher\\
11 - I'd love to chaperone the class overnight.\\
12 - We can share a tent.\\
13 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
14 -     I don't know    \\
15 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\
24 -     Life is unfair.    \\
25 - I can't believe Mr. Herkabe\\
26 - let you do a video project instead of a paper.\\
27 - You could've... asked.\\
28 - I don't have parents rich enough to buy me a video camera.\\
29 - Rich... and compensating.\\
30 - I don't even know what I'm going to write about.\\
31 - I mean, what's your movie going to be about?\\
32 - The creative... process.\\
33 - You writing... your paper.\\
34 - Is that thing on? Turn it off!\\
35 - I don't even have an idea yet.\\
36 - You're going to make me look like an idiot.\\
37 - I'm serious!\\
38 - This is... great.\\
39 - Now knock... me over.\\
40 - Hello.\\
41 - Hey, it's Abe.\\
42 - Oh, hey!\\
43 - I know it's short notice,\\
44 - but someone dropped out of our poker game.\\
45 - Can you make it tonight?\\
46 - Are you kidding? I have been waiting\\
47 - for you to invite me for months!\\
48 - See you at 8:00.\\
49 - Thanks!\\
50 - Hot-cha!\\
51 - Honey, honey, guess what, guess what?\\
52 - Guess what? I'm going to go play poker at Abe's tonight.\\
53 - He just asked me!\\
54 - Hal, tonight's our first dance class.\\
55 - That's tonight? Yes, it was your birthday present to me.\\
56 - Oh.\\
57 - Fine, go play poker.\\
58 - I love you!\\
59 - Great, now who am I going to go with?\\
60 - Did Reese finish his homework yet?\\
61 - Of course I finished my homework.\\
62 - Good. You can come to dance class with me.\\
63 - What? No, I was lying.\\
64 - I didn't finish my homework.\\
65 - I don't even know what my homework is!\\
66 - Go get your shoes.\\
67 - If the weather report's right,\\
68 - this storm's going to last a week.\\
69 - Now, you ration these supplies.\\
70 - And make no mistake--\\
71 - you're the last ones we'll dig out.\\
72 - We're supposed to live for a week\\
73 - on meat paste and caribou jerky?\\
74 - Hey, that's a week I don't get any work out of you.\\
75 - No one's crying for me!\\
76 - Now, it's just a friendly game.\\
77 - Mostly we sit around talking,\\
78 - but eventually we get around to playing cards.\\
79 - Sounds good to me.\\
80 - I'm looking forward to meeting your friends.\\
81 - Everybody, this is Hal.\\
82 - Hal. Hello, Hal.\\

92 - Oh... oh... whoops!\\
93 - Put a dollar in the pot.\\
94 - Oh, we got a regular D-Dog here.\\
95 - And right, left, cha-cha-cha.\\
96 - And remember, God created artificial hips for a reason.\\
97 - Let's use them.\\
98 - And, back, two, cha-cha, finish.\\
99 - All right, very good.\\
100 - Everyone, let's pair up.\\
101 - May I?\\
102 - Oh, okay.\\
103 - No way.\\
104 - You be a gentleman!\\
105 - It's just like touching a dead person.\\
106 - It's just like touching a dead person.\\
107 - Goodness, how many lessons have you had?\\
108 - What? None.\\
109 - Really? I'm impressed.\\
110 - You have very good instincts.\\
111 - I do? Mm-hmm.\\
112 - I'm not surprised.\\
113 - You're built for it.\\
114 - You have a dancer's ankles.\\
115 - I do not.\\
116 - You're a lovely young man.\\
117 - You don't shake like all the other men here.\\

123 - All right, you know what? That's it.\\
124 - I'm writing about you doing your movie.\\
125 - But my movie's... about your paper.\\
126 - Yeah, I'm doing my paper\\
127 - about you doing your movie about me doing my paper.\\
128 - Fine!\\
129 - My movie's...\\
130 - about you doing...\\
131 - your paper...\\
132 - about me doing...\\
133 - my...\\
134 - All right! I get it.\\
135 - ...movie...\\
136 - about you...\\
137 - Hey, guys, you know what you should\\
138 - do your movie about? Old people.\\
139 - Did you know that some of them\\
140 - have spent their entire lives saving money\\
141 - only to find out they've outlived everybody\\
142 - they want to share it with?\\
143 - Talk about sad.\\
144 - I raise you five.\\
145 - I see your five, and I raise you...\\
146 - two.\\
147 - Call.\\
148 - Full house, kings over eights.\\
149 - Straight flush to the jack!\\
150 - I knew you had it!\\
151 - How could you know that?\\
152 - He had... he had nothing on top!\\
153 - Trey never stays in unless he's got something good.\\
154 - Perhaps we should call it a night.\\
155 - We are definitely bringing you back.\\
156 - Hey, Brian, when was the last time\\
157 - you were ahead for an evening?\\
158 - He can't remember that far back.\\
159 - Now you got something to sneak into your wife's purse.\\
160 - I had the most wonderful time in dance class.\\
161 - Every time the instructor\\
162 - needed to show the class something,\\
163 - he used me as his partner.\\
164 - I always thought I was such a clodhopper.\\
165 - I cannot believe\\
166 - what I have missed all these years.\\
167 - Oh, how was your poker game?\\
168 - Hmm?\\
169 - It was great.\\
170 - Why wouldn't it be?\\
171 - I love Abe.\\
172 - I love poker.\\
173 - A whole night playing poker with Abe...\\
174 - and his friends.\\
175 - The teacher thinks I have dancer's ankles.\\
176 - What do you think, huh?\\
177 - You want to dance with the star pupil?\\
178 - What?\\
179 - You know... dance?\\
180 - No, I'm not in the mood.\\
181 - You're always in the mood.\\
182 - Not every single night of my life.\\
183 - Yes, you are.\\
184 - I'm not like some kind of machine.\\
185 - Yes, you are.\\
186 - You can't just snap your fingers...\\
187 - Yes, I can. I always have.\\
188 - Oh, all right.\\
189 - Palm kernel oil,\\
190 - pectin, manganese sulfate\\
191 - and...\\
192 - zinc oxide?\\
193 - Yes, that's meat paste, baby.\\
194 - Man, this sucks!\\
195 - We knew we were going to be stuck here for a week\\
196 - and no one even bothered to grab a deck of cards\\
197 - or a magazine.\\
198 - I could do my foot puppets again.\\
199 - Please, no.\\
200 - How long have we been stuck here for?\\
201 - I have lost all sense of time.\\
202 - I guess about five days.\\
203 - We've just got to keep ourselves busy.\\
204 - Tell you what.\\
205 - Let's put our heads together and recreate\\
206 - whole episodes of Gilligan's Island.\\
207 - We already did that.\\
208 - That was this storm?\\
209 - Look, if we don't come up with something to do,\\
210 - I'm going to go insane.\\
211 - Come on, Reese, we don't want to be late.\\
212 - We're doing the mambo tonight.\\
213 - I'll home about 10:30.\\
214 - What are you doing?\\
215 - Is it too much to ask that we get\\
216 - some pickles in this house that are edible?\\
217 - Hal, what's wrong? Nothing.\\
218 - Just... just go to your class.\\
219 - Look, you have been snapping at everybody all week.\\
220 - My class can wait one minute.\\
221 - Now, you tell me what's going on.\\
222 - All right.\\
223 - This thing happened and I didn't want to talk about it\\
224 - because I wasn't sure it actually happened,\\
225 - and if it didn't, I'd be like the biggest jerk in the world\\
226 - for saying that it did when it didn't.\\
227 - I'd be creating this whole big issue.\\
228 - But, you know what, the more I think about it,\\
229 - the more I realize it did happen.\\
230 - Oh, it did!\\
231 - You know, Dewey,\\
232 - I've recently come into a little money.\\
233 - So I went to the mall to buy myself a CD player,\\
234 - and then I saw this little kid that reminded me of you.\\
235 - And I thought of a better way to spend it.\\
236 - So, here.\\
237 - Wow!\\
238 - Oh, my God!\\
239 - The look on your face-- that was totally worth it!\\
240 - You're the worst brother ever.\\
241 - I know! I know!\\
242 - Because I was there when it happened!\\
243 - Oh, we like to think that the differences people have\\
244 - aren't really differences at all,\\
245 - but then suddenly you're on the outside\\
246 - being taken advantage of because you're different.\\
247 - Honey, I'm sorry. I got to go.\\
248 - We can talk later. Bye.\\
249 - Hello. Abe, it's Hal.\\
250 - You've reached Kenarbans.\\
251 - Please leave a message after the beep.\\
252 - Abe, it's Hal.\\
253 - I don't know if this is recording,\\
254 - but we have something we need to talk about.\\
255 - Now, I could be mistaken, and If I am\\
256 - I'm sure it's going to make me sound like I'm an idiot...\\
257 - Dad, Stevie's being really annoying.\\
258 - He's filming everything I do.\\
259 - Malcolm's being...\\
260 - Damn it, Stevie, I don't want to hear it.\\
261 - You just behave yourself.\\
262 - You are a guest in this house.\\
263 - He was a guest in your house.\\
264 - People should never yell at children.\\
265 - Especially children that aren't their own.\\
266 - I apologized two minutes later,\\
267 - and Stevie accepted the apology.\\
268 - You know, he's not that fragile,\\
269 - so why don't you just relax.\\
270 - Really. What?\\
271 - At least I'm man enough to apologize\\
272 - when I've been a jerk.\\
273 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
274 - You know darn well what I'm talking about.\\
275 - The way you and our friends treated me the other night.\\
276 - What?\\
277 - Oh, please.\\
278 - Look, obviously I'm different.\\
279 - I mean, I walked through that door\\
280 - and stuck out like a sore thumb.\\
281 - I always thought those things didn't matter, but...\\
282 - If you're implying what I think you're implying...\\
283 - You want me to just come out and say it?\\
284 - I think you'd better.\\
285 - Fine. You and your poker buddies\\
286 - all ganged up on me\\
287 - because I'm not a professional.\\
288 - Excuse me?! Yeah, you\\
289 - and your doctor friend and your lawyer friend\\
290 - and your dentist friend.\\
291 - You decided it was okay to skin a guy\\
292 - just because he's a working stiff.\\
293 - And I bet you had a big laugh about it afterwards.\\
294 - Listen, you idiot, we didn't gang up on you.\\
295 - You just stink at poker. Oh, is that right?\\
296 - That was a cheap shot.\\
297 - The truth... hurts.\\
298 - If we were playing\\
299 - in a straight game,\\
300 - I would have mopped the floor with you.\\
301 - We did play in a straight game-- Hah!\\
302 - and you went home crying to your mama.\\
303 - Well, why don't we play right now\\
304 - and we'll see who will do the crying\\
305 - and who will do the mopping.\\
306 - I will own you.\\
307 - I... I mean...\\
308 - I didn't mean...\\
309 - I meant...\\
310 - Oh, shut up and get the cards.\\
311 -        \\
312 - You going to see me?\\
313 - He doesn't have the flush.\\
314 - What?\\
315 - He has a tell.\\
316 - He licks his lips when he's bluffing.\\
317 - I'll see your five and...\\
318 - raise you five.\\
319 - Fold.\\
320 -        \\
321 - The bet's $10.\\
322 - I call. Straight.\\
323 - Flush.\\
324 - Time's up. My turn with the string.\\
325 - I don't have it. I gave it to Pete.\\
326 - I gave it to Francis.\\
327 - And then I gave it back to Eric.\\
328 - What? You did not.\\
329 - Yes, I did.\\
330 - What are you trying to pull?\\
331 - Nothing. I'm just saying I don't have the string.\\
332 - You're the last person I saw it with.\\
333 - What the hell are we going to do\\
334 - without that string?\\
335 - Guys, come on. It's just a stupid string.\\
336 - So what do you think would be a reason\\
337 - for saying that, Eric?\\
338 - You're the only one\\
339 - who seems to have a motive against the string.\\
340 - No, I love the string. It's just...\\
341 - Maybe you loved it a little too much.\\
342 - And I quote,\\
343 - "If I can't have the string, no one will."\\
344 - I didn't say that!\\
345 - Well, someone said it!\\
346 - You just now!\\
347 - Don't try to twist this around.\\
348 - He's not the one on trial.\\
349 - What trial?!\\
350 - Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!\\
351 - He raises four.\\
352 - Your four, five more.\\
353 - Malcolm, maybe...\\
354 - You want to play? Fine.\\
355 - I almost feel sorry for them.\\
356 - Almost.\\
357 - All right, we're going to end this right here.\\
358 - Winner take all.\\
359 - Fine.\\
360 - Turn 'em up.\\
361 - Three fives.\\
362 - Three fives with a jack.\\
363 - Yeah!\\
364 - That makes six fives!\\
365 - What the hell kind of deck has six fives!\\
366 - I don't know. I got 'em from the boys' room.\\
367 - You call yourself a poker player?\\
368 - You don't even have a decent deck.\\
369 - Well, I'm sorry\\
370 - I don't have solid gold playing cards\\
371 - like you're accustomed to at your house.\\
372 - This poor-guy act is getting a little tiring!\\
373 - Your superior act is getting a little old, too.\\
374 - If I'm such a big jerk why'd you even come over?!\\
375 - Pardon me for wanting to play poker\\
376 - with my best friend!\\
377 - I mean, I was really excited to come over and play poker\\
378 - and meet your other friends.\\
379 - Truth be told, I was excited for you to come over, too.\\
380 - I bought a new shirt.\\
381 - That Hawaiian one?\\
382 - I like that one.\\
383 - Why are we fighting like this?\\
384 - Because we're idiots!\\
385 - Well, boys, what do you say we all go out\\
386 - to get some ice cream?\\
387 - Sounds good to me.\\
388 - Hey, Dewey, come on. We're going for ice cream.\\
389 - Where's your brother?\\
390 - You see this, ladies?\\
391 - Mrs. Angela's going to get her dance.\\
392 - As for the rest of you, I'm not running a charity here.\\
393 - You have to come up with the dough!\\
394 - I do not dance on credit.\\
395 - No offense, but some of you\\
396 - might not even be around next week.\\
397 - Oh, I didn't want that to end.\\
398 - That does it.\\
399 - I'm signing up for your Monday- Wednesday class.\\
400 - Maybe Saturday, too.\\
401 - But first I've got to...\\
402 - Lois, Lois, please. Come-come with me.\\
403 - Uh...\\
404 - We have to stop this.\\
405 - Why?\\
406 - Honey, you've outgrown me.\\
407 - I give beginning dance lessons,\\
408 - usually to people who can barely move.\\
409 - Now...\\
410 - this is another instructor.\\
411 - He's across town, but he is the best.\\
412 - He's the only one who can take you to the next level.\\
413 - But I really love it here.\\
414 - Lois, you have a gift.\\
415 - You mustn't waste it.\\
416 - It's time for you to-to spread your wings...\\
417 - ...and fly.\\
418 - Fly away, little bird.\\
419 - Oh, my God!\\
420 - Francis, you're going to do it?!\\
421 - Hey, I'm your best friend.\\
422 - I'm not going to let one of these jerks brand you.\\
423 - Now everyone's going to know\\
424 - that you're a string thief.\\
425 - We're shoveled out.\\
426 - Vacation's over.\\
427 - He took the string.\\
428 - Every damn storm.\\
429 - So, Dewey, how come you're not playing with your toy?\\
430 - What are you smiling about?\\
431 -        \\
432 -        \\
433 - Where did you get this?!\\
434 -        \\
435 - Have a seat. In a minute\\
436 - you and Mrs. Johnson do the forbidden dance.\\
437 - You think that's the only copy?\\
438 - What do you take me for?\\
439 - Enjoy your assembly tomorrow.\\
440 - I'm going to the ball game with Abe this weekend.\\
441 - He had one ticket. Invited me.\\
442 - That's great, dear. I'm glad.\\
443 - What's this?\\
444 -        \\
445 - He was trying to get rid of me.\\
446 - Hal, turn this off.\\
447 - Hal?\\
448 - Oh, my God, I can't believe\\
449 - how beautifully you dance.\\
450 - Hal, you are such a fool.\\
451 -        
\subsection {Episode 09: Reese's Job}
1 - Where did you come from, flubba?\\
2 - Hello, Hal.\\
3 -     I'm so full of bacon    \\
4 -     My body's meant for shakin'    \\
5 -     And when I start to wiggle    \\
6 -     My nipples they will jiggle    \\
7 -     Ooh-ha-ooh-ha-ha    \\
8 -     Ooh-ha-ooh- ha-ha    \\
9 -     Ooh-ha-ooh-ha...    \\
10 - Once again, I have to be embarrassed for the both of us.\\
11 - Yup.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - You go straight to your job after school today.\\
25 - I don't want you to be late\\
26 - for your first day of work, and no excuses.\\
27 - I don't want to hear a lion escaped from the zoo.\\
28 - Or the bus driver went insane and refused to stop.\\
29 - Francis' friend, Richie, gave Reese\\
30 - a job at the Circus Burger.\\
31 - It's perfect.\\
32 - Reese gets to be bossed around all day\\
33 - by the only guy on the entire planet\\
34 - that's dumber than he is.\\
35 - This job is stupid.\\
36 - Well, you do get to wear a paper hat.\\
37 - Reese, you want to drive when you get your license,\\
38 - you're going to pay for your own insurance.\\
39 - Yeah, but if everyone else has insurance, then why do I need it?\\
40 - They've got it covered.\\
41 - Son, it's not as simple as that.\\
42 - You see...\\
43 - Good morning, everybody.\\
44 - Say good morning, Charlie.\\
45 - Show everyone how alive you are.\\
46 - My parents made a deal with Dewey.\\
47 - If he keeps his goldfish alive for two months,\\
48 - he gets a dog.\\
49 - Aren't I doing a good job?\\
50 - You sure are.\\
51 - How is that fish still alive?\\
52 - I don't know.\\
53 - He never feeds it.\\
54 - He leaves it out in the sun for hours.\\
55 - Last week, there was an old banana peel in there.\\
56 - I do not want a dog in this house.\\
57 - Well, as long as this fish is alive\\
58 - there's nothing we can do about it.\\
59 - Hal, I expect you to take care of this.\\
60 - What are you suggesting?\\
61 - I'm not suggesting anything.\\
62 - I just want it taken care of.\\
63 - Class, today we begin a new round\\
64 - of independent study projects.\\
65 - Hydrostatic Equilibrium.\\
66 - My God, I'm still mired in path integral quantization.\\
67 - My stepdad's right, I'm useless.\\
68 - Well, the cold hard fact of life is\\
69 - some are more advanced than others.\\
70 - Some even think they are more advanced than me.\\
71 - I never said that.\\
72 - And yet you assume I'm talking about you.\\
73 - You're looking right at me.\\
74 - I'm sure you're all convinced\\
75 - that by virtue of your being in this class\\
76 - your intellects tower above those of the tiny-minded\\
77 - plebeians wasting oxygen in the rest of the school.\\
78 - But to some, you are nothing more than howling primates.\\
79 - I am very excited to announce today\\
80 - that we are welcoming to our class a new student.\\
81 - A young man of unparalleled intellect.\\
82 - As near as we can measure, his IQ is over 280.\\
83 - Those tests are culturally biased.\\
84 - Think what you will.\\
85 - Your petty fears no longer concern me.\\
86 - I finally have the mental clay\\
87 - worthy of my sculpting.\\
88 - Barton is a white-hot comet of brilliance\\
89 - blazing through our dark little corner of ignorance.\\
90 - A mind of such unfathomable reach and enormous power.\\
91 - Can I come in now?\\
92 - Barton, I thought I told you to wait until you heard\\
93 - "a new era for man."\\
94 - But there's a bee out there.\\
95 - So, assistant manager.\\
96 - How'd that happen?\\
97 - INS raid cleaned us out.\\
98 - So, from 12:00 to 5:00, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\\
99 - this is my domain.\\
100 - I'm proof you don't really need to graduate\\
101 - from high school.\\
102 - That's just propaganda\\
103 - from those money-grubbing diploma companies.\\
104 - Sean, Doug, this is Reese.\\
105 - Hey. Hey, what's up?\\
106 - Hey. Hey.\\
107 - Okay, press cow for burger,\\
108 - potato for fries,\\
109 - and I'm not sure what this is.\\
110 - Does that look like a pig or a dog to you?\\
111 - Wouldn't it be easier to put words on the keys?\\
112 - Ah, a man of letters.\\
113 - A word to the wise--\\
114 - I wouldn't throw that in anyone's face.\\
115 - Once you got your total,\\
116 - you put the money in the drawer.\\
117 - Except if you're making a pocket transaction.\\
118 - What's that? It's kind of a morale builder.\\
119 - Once in a while, you take five or ten bucks.\\
120 - But you don't ring it up,\\
121 - you put it in your pocket instead.\\
122 - You don't have a problem with that, do you?\\
123 - Oh, no, that's cool.\\
124 - See, Reese?\\
125 - You've entered the working world.\\
126 - The world of adult responsibility.\\
127 - I have the key to her locker.\\
128 - You want to smell her jacket later,\\
129 - just let me know.\\
130 - Hey, they found the last piece of that guy.\\
131 - Oh, man.\\
132 - Come on, guys, we talked about this.\\
133 - If we're going share a roll of toilet paper,\\
134 - can we at least keep it on the spindle?\\
135 - As long as you're bringing this kind of stuff up,\\
136 - I got a fianc  e coming Thursday.\\
137 - Fianc  e? What are you talking about?\\
138 - I'm engaged.\\
139 - There comes a time when a man gets tired of playing the field.\\
140 - What field?\\
141 - You don't even know any women.\\
142 - That occurred to me, too.\\
143 - That's why I ordered one from Russia.\\
144 - A mail-order bride?\\
145 - That actually exists?\\
146 - Sure. In some of the more irradiated parts\\
147 - of the former Soviet Union,\\
148 - there are a lot of marriage-minded women.\\
149 - That's my darling, Svetlana.\\
150 - Wait a second.\\
151 - Yup.\\
152 - Svetlana.\\
153 - How come you're driving us to school?\\
154 - Because that's what mamas do sometimes.\\
155 - How'd you do on the test?\\
156 - Okay...\\
157 - you know your Tolstoy, and your Elliot.\\
158 - Let's see how you do with the Bard.\\
159 - "Every true man's apparel fits your thief."\\
160 - Measure for Measure, Act Four, Scene Two,\\
161 - Abhorson's speech to Pompey.\\
162 - Could you hand me my green crayon?\\
163 - Wow, he's right again.\\
164 - Okay, Barton, let's try Chaucer's The Shipman's Tale.\\
165 - Should I start with the prologue?\\
166 - Please.\\
167 - How about line 203?\\
168 - "'And when your husband has gone off to Flanders,\\
169 - "I shall deliver you from fear of slanders.'\\
170 - "And on the word, he caught her by the flanks\\
171 - "and clasped her closely, giving her a riot of kisses\\
172 - saying softly, 'Keep things quiet.'"\\
173 - What are you doing?!\\
174 - Chaucer?\\
175 - I can not believe you are polluting his mind\\
176 - with such pop culture drivel.\\
177 - I apologize for them, Barton.\\
178 - And I will do everything I can to minimize these\\
179 - annoying distractions, so that you can concentrate\\
180 - on the accelerated program I've laid out for you.\\
181 - Together, we are going to astonish the world.\\
182 - Would you like a Pixy Stix?\\
183 - Thank you.\\
184 - Having problems, Malcolm?\\
185 - No, no, not you.\\
186 - It's this stupid hydrostatic equilibrium.\\
187 - It just doesn't make any sense.\\
188 - Well, it is awfully difficult.\\
189 - But don't despair.\\
190 - I am here for you, Malcolm\\
191 - and I'll make sure\\
192 - that you get the help that you deserve.\\
193 - To estimate the pressure at the center of the sun,\\
194 - just assume a constant density of 1.41 grams\\
195 - per cubic centimeter.\\
196 - Am I going too fast for you?\\
197 - You know, Herkabe only made you my tutor to humiliate me.\\
198 - I thought it was to humiliate me.\\
199 - I don't understand why this is so hard.\\
200 - Don't give up.\\
201 - Remember the Little Engine That Could?\\
202 - You're not listening!\\
203 - I get everything.\\
204 - In my entire life,\\
205 - there is nothing I haven't been able to master.\\
206 - I took algebra in sixth grade.\\
207 - I taught my dad how to rebuild\\
208 - his transmission when I was five.\\
209 - I was reading before I could walk.\\
210 - I remember my own birth.\\
211 - What?\\
212 - Do you know your heart stops\\
213 - during your mother's contractions?\\
214 - You seriously remember that?\\
215 - The worst was the diaper-changing.\\
216 - That was the most degrading week of my life.\\
217 - So, what's it like in there?\\
218 - What do you mean?\\
219 - Well, your brain?\\
220 - I mean, for me, it's like when I'm thinking really hard,\\
221 - my brain starts making all these connections\\
222 - and those connections make other connections\\
223 - and everything starts moving really fast\\
224 - and it feels like a bomb's going off.\\
225 - Is your brain like that?\\
226 - It's more like a beehive\\
227 - and every bee has a brain like yours.\\
228 - Okay, ready!\\
229 - That is so cool!\\
230 - I wish you had a gun\\
231 - so we could really test this thing out.\\
232 - Excuse me, could I get some help here?\\
233 - Hey, Craig.\\
234 - So, I overheard your mom talking on the phone\\
235 - and it's true:\\
236 - you've got a job.\\
237 - I applied here, once.\\
238 - Didn't get it.\\
239 - It's all politics.\\
240 - I guess. So, what do you want?\\
241 - I want you to listen very carefully.\\
242 - My blood sugar is dangerously low\\
243 - so I don't want to burn up any calories repeating myself.\\
244 - I want the Jumbo Clown Burger with the Big-top Fries,\\
245 - no pickles, a slice of onion, make sure it's center-cut\\
246 - and extra tomatoes.\\
247 - And let's do the patty\\
248 - well on one side and medium on the other.\\
249 - And make sure they open a fresh package for my bun.\\
250 - If it's stale, I bail.\\
251 - Seriously.\\
252 - Your total's $5.45\\
253 - and you get free refills on the soda.\\
254 - I've heard that one before.\\
255 - Turns out, it's just for today.\\
256 - What a sack.\\
257 - That's a pocket transaction\\
258 - if I ever saw one.\\
259 - Oh.\\
260 - Yeah.\\
261 - Right.\\
262 - Artie, you put together one hell of a bachelor party.\\
263 - I'm much obliged to you.\\
264 - Oh, I'm just sorry the nearest stripper is 300 miles away.\\
265 - Hey, how's she doing, anyway?\\
266 - She took her top off.\\
267 - Oh, yeah!\\
268 - All right, all right, hey, listen up.\\
269 - I'd like to say a few words about my bunkmate, Pete, here\\
270 - on account of his upcoming nuptials.\\
271 - Many's the time when I've been feeling low\\
272 - and I always knew I could turn to Pete.\\
273 - He'd be lying there on his bunk,\\
274 - trimming his beard with a lighter\\
275 - and I'd think, "Hell, I'm better than that."\\
276 - To Pete, and his lucky lady.\\
277 - To Pete.\\
278 - Yeah!\\
279 - What's going on with you?\\
280 - I just don't get what we're celebrating.\\
281 - I mean, it just seems wrong.\\
282 - It's Pete's life; if he wants to marry\\
283 - a total stranger, that's his business.\\
284 - Well, what about this woman, is anyone thinking about her?\\
285 - Right now, I'm trying to keep a topless stripper in my head.\\
286 - I don't have room for much else.\\
287 - Think about it for a second.\\
288 - She's blindly committing to spend the rest of her life\\
289 - in this godforsaken place with Pete as her husband.\\
290 - I mean, what kind of a poor creature\\
291 - would actually go through with this?\\
292 - Maybe her life's pretty awful.\\
293 - Worse than this?\\
294 - What? Does she live in a slaughterhouse?\\
295 - Is she dragged to work by horses every day?\\
296 - She couldn't possibly know what she's getting into.\\
297 - You're exaggerating, man.\\
298 - We don't know.\\
299 - It might work out fine.\\
300 - Dudes, how's business?\\
301 - Where were you?\\
302 - I was supposed to be home for dinner\\
303 - but you're the only one who can cash me out.\\
304 - Hey, I'd stay on my good side if I was you.\\
305 - One of these days, somebody's going to have to clean out\\
306 - those bathrooms.\\
307 - Whoa, dude, this is way uncool.\\
308 - Reese, man, you can't take this much money.\\
309 - What are you talking about?\\
310 - Your cash drawer, man.\\
311 - It's over 400 bucks short.\\
312 - Look. The whole point is\\
313 - to take five or ten bucks, and that's it.\\
314 - You got to put the 400 back.\\
315 - I didn't take it, honest.\\
316 - Dude, it's your register.\\
317 - Did he give his register key to anyone today?\\
318 - No. Uh-uh.\\
319 - I didn't take it.\\
320 - I didn't take any.\\
321 - I never even did one of those stupid pocket transactions.\\
322 - What are you talking about? I saw you yesterday.\\
323 - No, I wanted it to look like I was taking it, but I didn't really.\\
324 - When you guys weren't looking,\\
325 - I put the money back.\\
326 - You guys didn't see it, because I was... being sneaky and stuff.\\
327 - Nice, Reese.\\
328 - Way to screw it up for everybody.\\
329 - I didn't take it.\\
330 - Look, man, if you think I'm covering for you, you're crazy.\\
331 - When the owner comes back tomorrow morning\\
332 - and checks the books, that money better be here\\
333 - or you're going down.\\
334 - Oh, dude.\\
335 - All right.\\
336 - To change from apparent to absolute magnitude in all spectra,\\
337 - the formula is "A over B, times K over D."\\
338 - That's if K is...\\
339 - How do they expect you to learn all these formulas?\\
340 - Use a mnemonic device.\\
341 - Like, "Anefru, Babbashar, Kalhla, Dastra..."\\
342 - Babylonian kings, Third Dynasty.\\
343 - Stop complaining.\\
344 - I have homework, too.\\
345 - Oh, it's a butterfly.\\
346 - Malcolm, you got to help me.\\
347 - What's going on?\\
348 - It's horrible.\\
349 - There was $400 missing from the register\\
350 - at the end of my shift, and they think I took it.\\
351 - Well, did you?\\
352 - No. Of course not.\\
353 - I'm Barton. Who's this dork?\\
354 - He's my tutor. You're kidding me.\\
355 - The one time I need you to be a genius,\\
356 - I find out you're faking the whole smart thing?\\
357 - Reese, calm down.\\
358 - How did this happen?\\
359 - I don't know. My register didn't\\
360 - total up right at the end of the shift.\\
361 - Who was there? Everyone:\\
362 - Me, Sean, Greta, Richie.\\
363 - Richie? Why didn't you say so in the first place?\\
364 - What do you mean? It's Richie, he's setting you up.\\
365 - How do you know? Because it's Richie.\\
366 - Come on.\\
367 - Barton, you want to go learn something about the real world?\\
368 - Not really. Too bad. You're coming.\\
369 - Dewey, you have to cover for us.\\
370 - Make sure it sounds like we're all still here.\\
371 - Got it.\\
372 - Ow...\\
373 - Stop it!\\
374 - You shut up.\\
375 - Stupid creeps...\\
376 - Ow... stop it...\\
377 - Did you get it?\\
378 - Yes, I got it.\\
379 - The pet store owner told me it was already dead.\\
380 - But I suspect the worst.\\
381 - We'll switch the fish tonight when Dewey's sleeping.\\
382 - I don't know, Lois.\\
383 - It seems so sneaky and underhanded.\\
384 - What kind of example are we setting for the boys?\\
385 - Oh, Hal, stop worrying.\\
386 - The boys are fine.\\
387 - Hey, dude, did you get the money?\\
388 - Yeah, you'd like another 400, wouldn't you?\\
389 - What are you talking about?\\
390 - Wow, an entire colony of Cryphonectria parasitica.\\
391 - Hey, get your own pizza, Dewey.\\
392 - His name's not Dewey.\\
393 - So, how come you've had me call him Dewey all these years?\\
394 - Look, we know you took the money\\
395 - and you're just trying to pin it on Reese.\\
396 - After everything my brother's done for you.\\
397 - All the alibis, all the handouts,\\
398 - all the times he's helped you fake your death.\\
399 - Whoa, dudes, I wasn't even there today.\\
400 - The only time I came in was to cash out.\\
401 - You were right there.\\
402 - Yeah, but I had a ten-minute break at 4:30.\\
403 - You could've snuck in then and taken the money.\\
404 - Well, yeah, but...\\
405 - You want to play innocent?\\
406 - Fine, we'll just let the police decide.\\
407 - Whoa, police.\\
408 - What makes you think the cops are going to take your side?\\
409 - Maybe 'cause you've already been arrested\\
410 - like ten times for petty theft.\\
411 - Excuse me, one of those was for arson.\\
412 - I'm telling you, you're making a big mistake.\\
413 - No, I'm not. Yes, you are.\\
414 - No, I'm not. Yes, you are.\\
415 - He didn't do it.\\
416 - According to this citation,\\
417 - Richie was stopped at 4:20 today at 18th and Wilson\\
418 - for urinating from a moving vehicle.\\
419 - So? So, the Circus Burger is\\
420 - on Walnut, which is at least 25 miles away.\\
421 - He couldn't have gotten there during Reese's break.\\
422 - Well, maybe if the traffic was light...\\
423 - Yeah, and maybe if a '78 Bonneville could go\\
424 - 300 miles an hour.\\
425 - Otherwise, it's impossible.\\
426 - Hey, hey, way to go, Dewey!\\
427 - Let me see that.\\
428 - Is he right?\\
429 - Yes.\\
430 - He's always right.\\
431 - Sorry, Richie.\\
432 - Come on, Reese, let's go.\\
433 - But I swear to God, I didn't do it.\\
434 - I didn't take the money.\\
435 - Well, look, we still have a few hours.\\
436 - Maybe we can figure out...\\
437 - Richie, I got us the DVD player\\
438 - but we need to steal another $600\\
439 - if you want the surround...\\
440 - ...sound.\\
441 - You may want to hang on to that receipt.\\
442 - I can't believe you lied.\\
443 - We're calling the cops.\\
444 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.\\
445 - Maybe we can figure out some sort of deal.\\
446 - Whatever you guys want, it's yours.\\
447 - We get to use your place for a party anytime we want.\\
448 - Yeah, and we get free burgers for life.\\
449 - And I get to make out with your girlfriend.\\
450 - Forget it.\\
451 - All right, the beanbag chair.\\
452 - Wow, Pete, is that really you?\\
453 - No, it's a reflection.\\
454 - Here, you can give these to Svetlana.\\
455 - Eric and Artie should be back any minute\\
456 - from Mamu with your bride.\\
457 - I got to be honest.\\
458 - I'm a little... I'm a little nervous.\\
459 - Well, you are about to marry a total stranger.\\
460 - Have you really thought about what you're doing?\\
461 - Oh, I've been thinking about settling down\\
462 - for a long, long time.\\
463 - Yeah, but you don't know anything about her.\\
464 - I mean, what if she thinks you're...\\
465 - What if she doesn't like you?\\
466 - Well, I'd be sad, but I'd reassure her\\
467 - that I'd support her anyway, because I made that commitment.\\
468 - Then I guess I'd spend\\
469 - the rest of my life being sweet to her\\
470 - in the hopes of changing her mind.\\
471 - Well, good luck, Pete.\\
472 - Thanks.\\
473 - Svetlana's here.\\
474 - And she is gorgeous.\\
475 - Oh!\\
476 - I must have...\\
477 - misread the catalog.\\
478 - Just look how light on her feet she is.\\
479 - Hey, baby. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
480 - Hey, guys...\\
481 - Oh, hey, Pete...\\
482 - Just get that thing out of here.\\
483 - I'll take care of it.\\
484 - I got it.\\
485 - Why you?\\
486 - Because I signed for it.\\
487 - Who cares if you signed for it? Wait a minute. Come here.\\
488 - Oh, there's our ride.\\
489 - So nice of Richie to drive you to school.\\
490 - Yeah, well, that's just his way\\
491 - of saying, "Thanks for a job well done."\\
492 - Good morning, everybody.\\
493 - Now, son, don't be disappointed.\\
494 - Say good morning, Charlie.\\
495 - Show everyone how alive you are.\\
496 - Aren't I doing a good job?\\
497 - Yeah, yeah, great.\\
498 - That little monster.\\
499 - He's been buying his own fish and switching them.\\
500 - God only knows how many he's gone through.\\
501 - He's going to pay for this.\\
502 - Well, how?\\
503 - If we bust him, he'll know we've been cheating, too.\\
504 - Dewey,\\
505 - your father and I are so proud\\
506 - of the way you've taken care of that fish.\\
507 - Yes, we are.\\
508 - You certainly proved to us that you can be trusted.\\
509 - It's so nice to have a boy\\
510 - who's so conscientious, responsible\\
511 - and honest, and who always finds a way\\
512 - to do the right thing.\\
513 - Before we go any further,\\
514 - is there anything you want to tell me?\\
515 - I want a beagle.\\
516 - Well, you're not going to get it, you little sneak!\\
517 - We know that you've been switching fish on us\\
518 - because I put a dead fish in there last night.\\
519 - That's cheating!\\
520 - You're cheaters!\\
521 - Well, not exactly textbook\\
522 - but at least we're not getting a dog.\\
523 - I cleaned out my cubby.\\
524 - You're sure I can't talk you into staying?\\
525 - My mom says I need a healthier environment.\\
526 - She thinks it's creepy the way you're using me\\
527 - for your own self-aggrandizement.\\
528 - A healthier environment?\\
529 - That is not what you need.\\
530 - Son, you will never connect normally\\
531 - with another human being.\\
532 - People will recognize your brilliance\\
533 - and they will loathe you for it.\\
534 - The best you can hope for is uncomprehending fear...\\
535 - which I can channel into great things.\\
536 - Please?\\
537 - Can I go now?\\
538 - Sure.\\
539 - Go.\\
540 - You, my ex-wife...\\
541 - all of my therapists, you're all the same.\\
542 - Bye, guys.\\
543 - Bye, Barton.\\
544 - Good luck at NASA.\\
545 - Send us a letter\\
546 - when you get declassified.\\
547 - Mr. Herkabe, we know this is hard for you, so...\\
548 - It's his dad.\\
549 - We Photoshopped your head in.
\subsection {Episode 10: Lois's Makeover}
1 - Mm, I'm starving.\\
2 - What's for dinner?\\
3 - Leftover parfait.\\
4 - It's even worse than it sounds.\\
5 - Once a week, Mom cleans out the fridge.\\
6 - Anything that doesn't actually have something growing on it\\
7 - gets thrown in a casserole and served for dinner.\\
8 - Did we have spaghetti or Chinese food on Thursday?\\
9 - Neither.\\
10 - Ah-ah, no digging!\\
11 - Sunday, Saturday, Friday...\\
12 - It finally happened.\\
13 - The fifth level of this week's leftover parfait\\
14 - is last week's leftover parfait.\\
15 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
16 -     I don't know    \\
17 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     Life is unfair.    \\
27 - All right, everyone, these...\\
28 - are your secret shopper evaluations,\\
29 - and I'm going to be meeting\\
30 - with each one of you individually this week\\
31 - so we can discuss...\\
32 - how we can make improvements.\\
33 - Look forward to it, sir.\\
34 - Secret shoppers?\\
35 - They sent people in to spy on us?\\
36 - What's next-- cavity searches on the loading dock?\\
37 - Come on, Craig, it's no big deal.\\
38 - Companies do this kind of thing all the time.\\
39 - But it's not fair!\\
40 - How can I be expected to work hard\\
41 - if I don't even know they're watching me?\\
42 - Craig, will you calm down?\\
43 - Look, it's like a paragraph.\\
44 - "Employee seemed very capable,\\
45 - "efficient, polite.\\
46 - Personal hygiene was questionable."\\
47 - Questionable?\\
48 - What are they talking about?\\
49 - My hy...\\
50 - "Slovenly"?\\
51 - They think I'm slovenly?\\
52 - You're right, Lois, this is ridiculous.\\
53 - "Apathetic, lazy, overweight."\\
54 - What planet are these people from?\\
55 - I'm taking a fiver.\\
56 - There's electricity in the air tonight, folks.\\
57 - I'm open, I'm open!\\
58 - We've been playing basketball with Dad since we\\
59 - were old enough to walk. What are you going to do, Reese?\\
60 - I'm open! What are you doing to do, huh?\\
61 - Oh!\\
62 - Yes, another basket for Hal!\\
63 - He's on fire!\\
64 - We're 0 and 342.\\
65 - We're starting to get a little discouraged.\\
66 - Game point.\\
67 - You take it out.\\
68 - This is our last chance.\\
69 - What do we do?\\
70 - Give it to me.\\
71 - Let's try another give-and-go.\\
72 - Dewey, you run to the basket\\
73 - and run around the pole.\\
74 - Ooh, come on, baby.\\
75 - That's it. Pass!\\
76 - I'm open!\\
77 - Oh, stolen by the Halinator.\\
78 - He shoots...\\
79 - He scores!\\
80 - Hal-elujah!\\
81 - Great game, boys.\\
82 - Good hustle.\\
83 - I hate this.\\
84 - If I want to be humiliated, I can take a math test.\\
85 - Wait a minute-- look.\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - Dewey, get away from my ball!\\
88 - No-- he's making baskets.\\
89 - He's never been able to do that before.\\
90 - You're right.\\
91 - That's how we're going to beat Dad.\\
92 - With Dewey.\\
93 - All right, which one of you filthy thieves\\
94 - has been rooting through my undies?\\
95 - What are you talking about?\\
96 - I'm saying one of you went through my footlocker\\
97 - and ate all my jerky.\\
98 - It wasn't us, Artie.\\
99 - Looks like a rat did it.\\
100 - Yeah, look at those teeth marks.\\
101 - Let's not jump to any conclusions.\\
102 - Think about it logically.\\
103 - If the rat was so filled up with Artie's jerky,\\
104 - would he be chewing on Francis' pillow right now?\\
105 - What?\\
106 - Get him!\\
107 - Die, vermin!\\
108 - Wow.\\
109 - Francis, you killed it.\\
110 - And it did eat your jerky.\\
111 - Okay, we've got you double-bagged\\
112 - in paper and plastic.\\
113 - That hair mousse that I recommended\\
114 - is bagged separately with your other sundries\\
115 - and I picked up your film at the photo counter.\\
116 - Can I take this out to your car for you?\\
117 - You don't have to do that for me.\\
118 - Nonsense. That's my job here at Lucky Aide.\\
119 - Oh!\\
120 - Pay it forward.\\
121 - Hey, Lois.\\
122 - Mr. Fisher,\\
123 - I wanted to talk to you about\\
124 - that secret shopper report.\\
125 - I think that they must have come in on the day\\
126 - that my son Dewey tried to cook his own breakfast,\\
127 - and by the time I put out the fire...\\
128 - Lois, this isn't personal.\\
129 - Well, it's...\\
130 - It's not like I'm...\\
131 - Lois, there is nothing for you to freak out over.\\
132 - And we have people in the company\\
133 - with the skills and the experience to help you.\\
134 - Wow, Lois, this is, like, going to be so fun!\\
135 - Okay, let's try it one more time.\\
136 - Yes.\\
137 - Perfect. Dad won't have any idea what hit him.\\
138 - He's going down.\\
139 - You think he'll cry?\\
140 - Oh, yeah. He'll cry.\\
141 - You know, you have really pretty eyes.\\
142 - You shouldn't hide them behind no makeup.\\
143 - This is wrong.\\
144 - I do my job.\\
145 - I do my job well.\\
146 - I dress appropriately and I am clean.\\
147 - That should be enough.\\
148 - Or you could be pretty.\\
149 - Put your chin up.\\
150 - What do they want from me?\\
151 - I take care of three kids.\\
152 - I run a house.\\
153 - I work 38 hours a week\\
154 - and they think I should look like some supermodel\\
155 - just to ring up some guy's rash ointment?\\
156 - You tell me how that's fair.\\
157 - You know, Lois, it's okay to be scared of change.\\
158 - I mean, my boyfriend freaked when I got my driver's license.\\
159 - Don't worry.\\
160 - I'll take good care of you.\\
161 - Oh, God, Hal, you wouldn't believe\\
162 - what happened to me at work today.\\
163 - I had to spend five hours\\
164 - with this stuff on my face in front of everybody!\\
165 - I've never been so humiliated...\\
166 - You're the most beautiful woman\\
167 - that ever was or ever could be.\\
168 - Hey, Francis,\\
169 - I heard you killed a rat yesterday.\\
170 - Is that right?\\
171 - What?\\
172 - Yes, sir. He's the one.\\
173 - Good.\\
174 - I, uh, I got a rat problem in my bunk.\\
175 - I'd be much obliged if you took care of it.\\
176 - Oh, I don't think...\\
177 - He would be honored.\\
178 - We both would.\\
179 - Great.\\
180 - What are you doing?\\
181 - I don't know anything about killing rats.\\
182 - Who cares? Do you like mopping?\\
183 - Do you want to see what they start tracking in here\\
184 - during bear season?\\
185 - Come on, baby, bring it on.\\
186 - You think I'm scared of you?\\
187 - I changed your diapers.\\
188 - Whoo-hoo.\\
189 - Dewey, you made a basket.\\
190 - Good for you!\\
191 - All right.\\
192 - Yeah.\\
193 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
194 - What are you looking at?\\
195 -        \\
196 - Oww!\\
197 - Sorry, son.\\
198 - Hey!\\
199 - Whoa!\\
200 - Rejected!\\
201 - Good game, boys.\\
202 - Good game?\\
203 - You fouled us on every play.\\
204 - Boys, part of the game\\
205 - is learning how to lose gracefully.\\
206 - I mean, if I've taught you anything\\
207 - it's how to be a good sportsman, hmm?\\
208 - I guess the rat could be coming out of this hole here.\\
209 - What are you going to do?\\
210 - We could try to lure him out.\\
211 - Anyone have a cookie or anything?\\
212 - It worked. You did it.\\
213 - I did.\\
214 - Well, kill him.\\
215 - Yes! He did it!\\
216 - That was amazing, Francis.\\
217 - You have the gift.\\
218 - Hi, Lois.\\
219 - I was at the coffee place\\
220 - and just thought I'd pick you up a latte.\\
221 - Thanks.\\
222 - (indistinct announcement over P.A.)\\
223 - What are you doing, Lois?\\
224 - You shouldn't be lifting those heavy boxes.\\
225 - I always do it.\\
226 - I'll take care of it.\\
227 - Hold it a second.\\
228 - You've watched me pick up boxes\\
229 - every day for four years.\\
230 - Suddenly, now you want to help me?\\
231 - Why?\\
232 - I don't know... I just thought...\\
233 - No, you look me in the face\\
234 - and you tell me why.\\
235 - I don't know.\\
236 - I'm sorry.\\
237 - I'm just going to go get lunch, okay?\\
238 - Can I get you anything?\\
239 - How'd it go?\\
240 - Well, Buzz, I don't want to bore you\\
241 - with the technical details,\\
242 - so let's just say that cabin 15\\
243 - is once again rodent free.\\
244 - Three cheers for Francis.\\
245 - Hip-hip, hooray!\\
246 - What are you fools cheering about?\\
247 - You caught yourself a couple of tiny rats.\\
248 - Whoop-dee-dee.\\
249 - You ain't nothing\\
250 - until you take out a real rat.\\
251 - You ain't nothing until you dance in the moonlight\\
252 - with Rose Marie.\\
253 - Who?\\
254 - They ain't told you about Rose Marie, eh?\\
255 - Well, she is the biggest, ugliest, meanest rat\\
256 - north of Kotzebue.\\
257 - Lives right here under this here building.\\
258 - Come on, Rose Marie ain't real.\\
259 - Yeah, she's just a creepy old myth\\
260 - like the Stonehenge or boxing kangaroos.\\
261 - She's as real as you and me.\\
262 - So, what do you say, rat boy?\\
263 - You think you're man enough?\\
264 - Old man, you better start building a very small coffin.\\
265 - So Reese sets the pick here\\
266 - and I get the dish off of Dewey.\\
267 - See? We just keep moving the ball around the perimeter.\\
268 - He can't cover all three of us\\
269 - no matter how dirty he plays.\\
270 - Wow!\\
271 - Very nice.\\
272 - Great ball movement.\\
273 - You guys are looking really good.\\
274 - I'm impressed.\\
275 - I'd be really worried\\
276 - if I didn't have my patented fall-away jump shot.\\
277 - Whoo! Ow!\\
278 - Oh, my ankle!\\
279 - Oh, I twisted my ankle.\\
280 - Help me into the house, boys.\\
281 - Boys.\\
282 - Sure, Dad, we'll help you.\\
283 - Ooh.\\
284 - Hey, boys. What's up?\\
285 - Not much.\\
286 - How's the leg?\\
287 - I think it's feeling a little better.\\
288 - It's interesting how you just happened to hurt your leg.\\
289 - What does that mean?\\
290 - I don't know.\\
291 - It's just interesting.\\
292 - Yeah. Interesting.\\
293 - All right, what are you boys getting at?\\
294 - It's just that some people are willing\\
295 - to go to pretty drastic lengths\\
296 - just to avoid being beaten by their kids.\\
297 - This is about basketball?\\
298 - You think I faked this\\
299 - because I didn't want to play you in basketball?\\
300 - You know what?\\
301 - I'm going to play you right now-- like this--\\
302 - and I'm still going to mop the floor with you!\\
303 - That's okay.\\
304 - You rest.\\
305 - We can wait.\\
306 - Yeah. It's got to heal sometime, right?\\
307 - Here you go.\\
308 - I had to move a couple dozen bags\\
309 - of charcoal briquettes\\
310 - but I found the slightly darker blue one that you wanted.\\
311 - I got a few spider bites, but none of that matters\\
312 - as long as you, the customer, go home satisfied.\\
313 - You're welcome.\\
314 - Excuse me.\\
315 - Where are your dog toys?\\
316 - Yes, ma'am. They're right there.\\
317 - Right behind you.\\
318 - Those are leashes!\\
319 - If I could direct your attention\\
320 - three inches to the right.\\
321 - I want that\\
322 - little hot dog up on top.\\
323 - Sure thing.\\
324 - I... I see we have one just like it right here.\\
325 - That isn't what I asked for.\\
326 - This has mustard on it!\\
327 - Peekaboo doesn't eat mustard!\\
328 - Well, I can see the one up there has mustard on it, too,\\
329 - and since it's not even real mustard...\\
330 - Are you going to give me what I ask for?!\\
331 - Certainly.\\
332 - There you go.\\
333 - Thanks for shopping Lucky Aide.\\
334 - This has mustard on it!\\
335 - That's what I tried to tell you, you old bat!\\
336 - Now, you're going to take it to your dog\\
337 - and make him like it!\\
338 - Hey, Lois, listen, I'm real sorry to do this to you\\
339 - but my brother got hockey tickets for tonight\\
340 - and I know I said I'd close up for you...\\
341 - Tom, I've already rearranged my schedule.\\
342 - Besides, I covered for you last week.\\
343 - Well, I'm sorry, Lois.\\
344 - Gee, Tom, I really don't know what to do.\\
345 - Isn't there any way at all\\
346 - you could be just a little late for your game?\\
347 - Well, I guess so.\\
348 - Thanks.\\
349 - Ha!\\
350 - Get your sneakers, faker.\\
351 - Francis?\\
352 - Yeah?\\
353 - If you die, can I have your pillow?\\
354 - I already promised it to Artie.\\
355 - Gotcha.\\
356 - I found her tracks!\\
357 - You hear that?\\
358 - He said I get his pillow.\\
359 - Wait a minute!\\
360 - I see something!\\
361 - Oh!\\
362 - I see a baby rat!\\
363 - No wonder Rose Marie's so fierce.\\
364 - She's a mother!\\
365 - Well, go ahead and kill it!\\
366 - I don't want to kill a baby.\\
367 - It's a rat!\\
368 - All right.\\
369 - Hey, this wood is rotten.\\
370 - Just a second.\\
371 - I think I can get to it.\\
372 - Yes.\\
373 - That's 14-13.\\
374 - We're up.\\
375 - Game point.\\
376 - Well, I have to say you boys have put up a good fight\\
377 - which is just going to make it all the more painful\\
378 - when I crush you like bugs.\\
379 - Score, yeah!\\
380 - Ha, tie game.\\
381 - Next basket wins.\\
382 - My ball.\\
383 - We have to do the play.\\
384 - We can't.\\
385 - We only practiced it once.\\
386 - It won't work.\\
387 - It will work.\\
388 - We just got to believe.\\
389 - It's go time, ladies.\\
390 -        \\
391 - The future is now, old man.\\
392 - Hey, Lois.\\
393 - I just want to thank you\\
394 - for the terrific job you've done this week.\\
395 - You have shown a marked improvement\\
396 - in both your performance\\
397 - and your attitude.\\
398 - That's nice of you to say, Mr. Fisher,\\
399 - but really, I haven't done anything different.\\
400 - There's that great attitude.\\
401 - Anyhow, I think we're\\
402 - going to have an opening pretty soon\\
403 - in customer service.\\
404 - Really?\\
405 - It wouldn't be much of a raise in pay,\\
406 - but you wouldn't have to work any more late nights.\\
407 - That would be great.\\
408 - Now, you would have to dress up your appearance a little.\\
409 - Excuse me?\\
410 - You know, just a little more... feminine.\\
411 - More feminine?\\
412 - Well, you're on the right track.\\
413 - Just a little... more.\\
414 - Uh, can I let you know tomorrow?\\
415 - Sure thing.\\
416 - Damn.\\
417 - Hi.\\
418 - Hello.\\
419 - Can I help you?\\
420 - I don't know, maybe.\\
421 - What'll it cost me?\\
422 - What?\\
423 - Is it cheaper if we use my car\\
424 - or do we have to get a room?\\
425 - You think I'm a hooker?\\
426 - No.\\
427 - You do!\\
428 - You think I'm a hooker!\\
429 - Thank you!\\
430 - Come with me.\\
431 - A prostitute.\\
432 - This guy was convinced I was a prostitute.\\
433 - You know, ever since I got your stupid report\\
434 - I have been feeling like everything\\
435 - I ever believed in was wrong.\\
436 - Well, I think this little incident\\
437 - gives both of us some much-needed clarity.\\
438 - I'm going to go home now.\\
439 - I'm going to wash my face\\
440 - and when I come to work tomorrow,\\
441 - I'm going to do the same extraordinarily good job\\
442 - I've been doing all these years.\\
443 - I'm going to do it in my 99-cent mascara\\
444 - and if the mood strikes me, a hair clip, and that's it.\\
445 - And if that's not good enough for you, so be it.\\
446 - Thank you.\\
447 - Well, Steve, are you going to tell my sister or should I?\\
448 - This place is a pigsty.\\
449 - Hal, will you hand me the...\\
450 - Hal...?
\subsection {Episode 11: Company Picnic (Part 1)}
1 - There it is.\\
2 - Kill it.\\
3 - Dewey, a spider has just as much right\\
4 - to live as you or I.\\
5 - Besides, it's unlucky to kill it in the house.\\
6 - Okay.\\
7 - Hello, little fella.\\
8 - Come on, sweetheart.\\
9 - Oh!\\
10 - Go! Go! Go!\\
11 - Open the door! Open the door!\\
12 - Front or back or side?!\\
13 - Side. No, back. No, front! Front!\\
14 - Oh, my God, did we just...?\\
15 - Go.\\
16 - She can only ground me.\\
17 - Get your keys and go.\\
18 - But... Go!\\
19 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
20 -     I don't know    \\
21 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     And you're not so big    \\
30 -     Life is unfair.    \\
31 - My dad's company picnic is tomorrow.\\
32 - Laurie Millbrook is going to be there.\\
33 - I've kind of had a crush on her since third grade.\\
34 - I haven't seen her since she moved across town last year.\\
35 - I've grown about four inches since then,\\
36 - but I can't just count on that.\\
37 - If I do, like, 10,000 of these tonight,\\
38 - I should have something to show by tomorrow.\\
39 - Dewey, no candy tomorrow.\\
40 - Do you understand?\\
41 - But I'll be fine.\\
42 - No, you won't.\\
43 - What happened at the last company picnic?\\
44 - I got in a fight with that redheaded boy.\\
45 - And why did you do that?\\
46 - 'Cause I ate candy.\\
47 - Because you ate candy.\\
48 - You do not metabolize sugar well.\\
49 - You get mean and crazy,\\
50 - you get into fights and you end up crying.\\
51 - Do you want that to happen again this year?\\
52 - No. No.\\
53 - Now go get ready for bed.\\
54 - Okay.\\
55 - What do you think? This..\\
56 - or this?\\
57 - What are you doing?\\
58 - This is an important office function, Lois.\\
59 - It's a company picnic.\\
60 - A picnic attended by my new boss,\\
61 - whom  I haven't met yet.\\
62 - I have to start off on the right foot.\\
63 - Hal, you're making too much of this.\\
64 - No, I am not.\\
65 - If I've learned one thing\\
66 - it's that you have to make a good first impression.\\
67 - It sets a tone for the entire relationship.\\
68 - Hal, this is your new supervisor\\
69 - Ms. Plum.\\
70 - Great to meet you, Hal.\\
71 - I'm really looking forward to working with you.\\
72 - Same here.\\
73 - Oh, and what do we have here?\\
74 - My big fat stomach.\\
75 - You know, I'd like you to meet your staff\\
76 - but I'm not quite sure where everyone went.\\
77 - It is great to meet you, Mr. Jacobson.\\
78 - I just want you to know\\
79 - that I am going to do a terrific job for you.\\
80 - Well, that's great, Hal. I'm sure you are.\\
81 - Have you met my daughter and son-in-law?\\
82 - No, I haven't had the pleasure.\\
83 - Kelly? Steve?\\
84 - I want you to meet somebody.\\
85 - Hi, I'm Hal.\\
86 - Hi, Hal.\\
87 - So, nice...\\
88 - Oh, oh!\\
89 - Oh, my God!\\
90 - There's a toothpick in my eye!\\
91 - She's gushing blood.\\
92 - For God's sakes, somebody put a tourniquet on her neck!\\
93 - I'm outside of my body.\\
94 - I can see a light.\\
95 - Grandma, is that you?\\
96 - You son of a bitch!\\
97 - I'm going to chew off your face!\\
98 - I'm going to spit it out\\
99 - and I'm going to dance on it!\\
100 - I'm going to kill you!\\
101 - I'm going to drag your carcass\\
102 - through the streets!\\
103 - She's got a toothpick in her eye!\\
104 - It's like a chess game, Lois.\\
105 - Every subtle move is vital.\\
106 - Eight...\\
107 - Oh, my God!\\
108 - What'd you do? You're huge!\\
109 - Shut up. I'd be careful.\\
110 - You might frighten Laurie with your savage manliness.\\
111 - Who says I'm doing it for Laurie?\\
112 - Oh, so Laurie's fair game, then?\\
113 - I wonder if she likes older men.\\
114 - Reese, don't.\\
115 - Look, I really like this girl.\\
116 - Please.\\
117 - It's my first chance to see her\\
118 - since she moved away.\\
119 - I'm asking you as a brother.\\
120 - Please don't be a jerk and screw this up.\\
121 - Wow, this desperate groveling is new for you.\\
122 - Keep it up.\\
123 - You call yourselves a hockey team?\\
124 - If we're going to beat McAllister Oil,\\
125 - you're going to have to play\\
126 - a hell of a lot better than that.\\
127 - You're making stupid mistakes.\\
128 - You're missing opportunities.\\
129 - You got to keep your mind on the game.\\
130 - Are our paychecks here yet?\\
131 - Aren't you done with that sink yet?\\
132 - Are you kidding?\\
133 - There's more in here than when I started.\\
134 - You're not leaving till that sink is finished.\\
135 - It would go a lot faster if Eric were helping.\\
136 - I'm not letting my star player anywhere near that toxic filth.\\
137 - I slave away all day by myself\\
138 - just because he plays hockey?\\
139 - He doesn't just play hockey.\\
140 - He skates like the wind.\\
141 - And he's got a 70-mile-an-hour slap shot.\\
142 - Well, indoors... fresh ice.\\
143 - We're going to teach those thugs from the oil rig a lesson\\
144 - they'll never forget.\\
145 - Those chicks won't know what hit 'em.\\
146 - You're playing girls?\\
147 - Well, the men won't play us till we beat their ladies team.\\
148 - We're fed up with those girls.\\
149 - They play dirty, they make fun of us\\
150 - and they steal our women.\\
151 - Wow. People who are actually more humiliated than me.\\
152 - I'd love to see that.\\
153 - Wish granted.\\
154 - You're our new equipment manager.\\
155 - What?\\
156 - Renaldo came down with jock lung.\\
157 - Here's your check.\\
158 - Here you go, Eric.\\
159 - There's a little something extra in there for you.\\
160 - Thanks.\\
161 - Wait a minute.\\
162 - There's no money in this check.\\
163 - It says I owe you $14.\\
164 - I didn't even buy anything last week.\\
165 - There's been some cost of living increases.\\
166 - Your room, your board, your pillow rental,\\
167 - then there's those rubber gloves\\
168 - you insist on wearing, princess.\\
169 - This is insane.\\
170 - I'm not going to work 60 hours a week\\
171 - and still end up owing you money.\\
172 - I quit.\\
173 - Fine. Just give me the $604 you racked up\\
174 - since you got here, you're free to go.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - How could I possibly have $604 when you keep taking all my money?!\\
177 - Well, then shut up!\\
178 - And get back to work.\\
179 - And you better not\\
180 - let your equipment manager duties\\
181 - get in the way of your real work.\\
182 - Man, that sucks.\\
183 - Hello.\\
184 - Malcolm, great. It's me-- Francis.\\
185 - Listen, I'm in a real bind up here...\\
186 - Francis, I don't have any money.\\
187 - Wait, hear me out.\\
188 - Tell Mom they're sending\\
189 - all the smart kids to Washington, DC.\\
190 - Hit her up for $600 and then just spend\\
191 - a long a weekend at Stevie's...\\
192 - Reese, phone.\\
193 - Hello.\\
194 - Reese, great.\\
195 - Um, you know that hardware store on Second?\\
196 - Okay, they've got a real slippery entryway...\\
197 - Dewey, phone.\\
198 - Francis?\\
199 - Yep.\\
200 - Money? Yep.\\
201 - I don't know why I go to these things.\\
202 - I am so nervous.\\
203 - My stomach sounds like a bunch of dogs fighting.\\
204 - Listen to this.\\
205 - Put your ear down there.\\
206 - Hal, you'll be fine.\\
207 - What are you doing?\\
208 - Just keep moving.\\
209 - Hal, do you even know your new boss is here?\\
210 - Are you kidding? They're all here.\\
211 - There's Landon.\\
212 - He's the head of the whole company.\\
213 - Of course the new guy's here.\\
214 - Don't talk nonsense!\\
215 - Well, you've never met the man.\\
216 - Do you even know who you're hiding from?\\
217 - That's a good point.\\
218 - Barry, is the new boss here yet?\\
219 - Yeah. He's right over there.\\
220 - Let me know when you're going to introduce yourself.\\
221 - Most of us figure\\
222 - you're going to set him on fire.\\
223 - Hey, no fair giving him ideas. Bet's off.\\
224 - Come on, fellas, I'm nervous enough as it is.\\
225 - Hal, we're just teasing you.\\
226 - Come on. You'll do fine.\\
227 - You and I both know that's a lie.\\
228 - Yeah, well, I tried.\\
229 - Oh, hi, Mom.\\
230 - Splendid day for a picnic.\\
231 - You want to do this the easy way\\
232 - or the hard way?\\
233 - The hard way.\\
234 - Spread 'em.\\
235 - Honey, I'm not always going to be around to do this.\\
236 - You have to control yourself.\\
237 - I know.\\
238 - Undies.\\
239 - Malcolm?\\
240 - Laurie, hi.\\
241 - It's so good to see you.\\
242 - Yeah... good to see you, too.\\
243 - Wow, I can't believe how tall you are.\\
244 - Yeah... well, you know.\\
245 - Oh, man,\\
246 - I've missed you guys so much.\\
247 - I've missed you, too...\\
248 - I mean, we've all missed you.\\
249 - Everyone. Not just me.\\
250 - Hey, are you doing that three-legged scavenger hunt?\\
251 - The what? They tie your leg\\
252 - to another person and send you off\\
253 - into the woods to find stuff.\\
254 - It might be fun. Plus you can win $100.\\
255 - I just need a partner.\\
256 - Do you want to do it?\\
257 - Really?\\
258 - Yeah. It sounds great.\\
259 - Cool.\\
260 - Is that your brother?\\
261 - Hi, Reese.\\
262 - Sorry, I'm gay.\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - You work for the company or are you a drag-along?\\
265 - Definitely a drag-along.\\
266 - Oh, me, too. Me, too.\\
267 - My husband drags me along to these functions,\\
268 - then he runs off and talks to his friends.\\
269 - I hide. Hide?\\
270 - From my kids.\\
271 - It's so great to have somebody to talk to.\\
272 - I'm really so bad at social situations.\\
273 - My psychiatrist says\\
274 - that I'm emotionally detached\\
275 - and that I have paranoid fantasies\\
276 - about what people are thinking about me.\\
277 - Uh-huh.\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - Sometimes it can get really ugly.\\
280 - False accusations, crying jags.\\
281 - I don't know why my husband married me.\\
282 - Oh, I mean, I know why I married him, of course.\\
283 - Because I'm addicted to disapproval.\\
284 - Ah. Really?\\
285 - Oh, yeah, yeah.\\
286 - Of course, I only have myself to blame\\
287 - because he's exactly like my father was.\\
288 - Oh, my God, he was so judgmental.\\
289 - Every time I opened my mouth,\\
290 - I felt like I was torturing him.\\
291 - Go! Good hustle!\\
292 - Nice slashing!\\
293 - Guys, let's go!\\
294 - Keep it moving!\\
295 - Keep your legs moving!\\
296 - Good!\\
297 - Push it!\\
298 - Good move, Wendy!\\
299 - Don't relax!\\
300 - Wow, they're good.\\
301 - They got nothing on my boy.\\
302 - How's the diarrhea?\\
303 - You feeling all right?\\
304 - Tip-top.\\
305 - Hey, Coach, there's Lavernia.\\
306 - I hear she might actually have a team this year.\\
307 - You think we ought to adjust the front line?\\
308 - Clarence... Clarence.\\
309 - What?\\
310 - Oh, hey, Lavernia.\\
311 - I was afraid\\
312 - you'd show your face.\\
313 - Not that I was afraid you'd play me--\\
314 - just that you'd show your face. Ha!\\
315 - Hello, Clarence.\\
316 - I thought you only gave your pep talks in your van.\\
317 - Ah, you'll get a boyfriend one of these days.\\
318 - You'll have that moment of bliss,\\
319 - and then you'll bite his head off\\
320 - and lay your rotten eggs down his decapitated body.\\
321 - Come on, was that comment necessary?\\
322 - That's exactly why people don't like you.\\
323 - People like me.\\
324 - Who doesn't like me?\\
325 - I got a good feeling about today.\\
326 - Look at these girls.\\
327 - They're not so tough.\\
328 - Wait till I get out there.\\
329 - I'm going to go...\\
330 - How's my breath?\\
331 - It seems fine.\\
332 - Not too minty?\\
333 - 'Cause that can be just as bad.\\
334 - Please give me back my compact.\\
335 - Okay, get in, get out.\\
336 - Just say hello and go.\\
337 - Nope.\\
338 - Mr. Landon, hello.\\
339 - Hey, Hal.\\
340 - I told you about the first time I met this guy, right?\\
341 - The urinal cake guy.\\
342 - Unbelievable.\\
343 - But I didn't fire him.\\
344 - He's turned out to be one of our finest\\
345 - systems managers.\\
346 - Just goes to show you that even a gibbering idiot\\
347 - can surprise you.\\
348 - Oh, you know, sir, that would make a great chapter heading\\
349 - for your new book.\\
350 - I thought he dropped his pill case.\\
351 - Excuse me for being considerate.\\
352 - Hi. John Pratt!\\
353 - It is a pleasure to meet you!\\
354 - Hi.\\
355 - You are a hard man to find.\\
356 - I finally had to have someone point you out.\\
357 - Well, it's not like I'm avoiding you.\\
358 - I had heard you had a great sense of humor.\\
359 - I know it's just going to be great working with you.\\
360 - Oh, yeah? Yeah.\\
361 - Well, I-I should get back to my family now.\\
362 - Oh, right, right.\\
363 - I'm sorry to hold you up.\\
364 - It is a real pleasure to meet you, Mr. Landon.\\
365 - Same here.\\
366 - All right, boys, you got ten minutes.\\
367 - Leave your wallets and other valuables in here.\\
368 - And hustle up.\\
369 - We got to get out on the ice and warm up.\\
370 - I don't think I can play.\\
371 - My glute cramped up on the ride over.\\
372 - You have to play.\\
373 - Go lay down on that table.\\
374 - You.\\
375 - Get over there.\\
376 - Give him a good, strong massage.\\
377 - Work that knot out of his glute.\\
378 - Out of his what?\\
379 - No way!\\
380 - He's our goalie. We need him.\\
381 - No!\\
382 - Look, you owe me $604.\\
383 - You do this, I'll take off a dollar fifty.\\
384 - A dollar fifty?!\\
385 - And if you don't,\\
386 - I'll charge you 50 bucks for the ride home.\\
387 - The rest of you get out there!\\
388 - Show them what you got.\\
389 - Here, you're responsible for these valuables\\
390 - till after the game.\\
391 - Don't be afraid to dig in deep.\\
392 - If it helps, I'll unhitch the trapdoor.\\
393 - Get up, you idiot!\\
394 - What, are you stupid?!\\
395 - I said hustle to the crease!\\
396 - Hustle!\\
397 - Hey, I was just hanging out in the locker room\\
398 - and the other coach approached me.\\
399 - What's that gin-soaked, reptilian sack of dog logs\\
400 - trying to pull now?\\
401 - He wants to make a little wager with you\\
402 - on the outcome of the game.\\
403 - $642 to be exact.\\
404 - I don't bet.\\
405 - I earn my money, and I hold on to it.\\
406 - Yeah, he said you'd be afraid.\\
407 - Oh, he did?\\
408 - He also said that John Grisham was a hack\\
409 - with no sense of plot and a tin ear for dialogue.\\
410 - What?!\\
411 - He said that about Mr. Grisham?\\
412 - All right, he wants to bet, we'll bet.\\
413 - Tell him to make it $700.\\
414 - He was pretty adamant about the $642.\\
415 - Fine.\\
416 - Hey, Chuck!\\
417 - I need you to hold on to some bet money.\\
418 - Okay.\\
419 - That idiot Clarence has no idea\\
420 - what we've got in store for him.\\
421 - Go, go!\\
422 - Go!\\
423 - Oh, ho-ho!\\
424 - Easiest $700 I ever made.\\
425 - I don't know what's with my skates.\\
426 - The blades are so dull.\\
427 - Hey, somebody unscrewed mine.\\
428 - I got Vaseline all over my grip tape.\\
429 - Go, go, go, go!\\
430 - He is never home.\\
431 - The last time that we had dinner together\\
432 - was six months ago.\\
433 - And that was with his boss.\\
434 - Oh, and did I tell you about our anniversary?\\
435 - I bought $30 worth of candles.\\
436 - $30 worth.\\
437 - And I was wearing a negligee the size of a postage stamp.\\
438 - He walks in an hour late, goes straight to the computer\\
439 - and spends the next six hours in a chat room.\\
440 - I drank an entire bottle of champagne.\\
441 - Then I passed out and I woke up the next morning\\
442 - with the dog licking my face.\\
443 - And I actually thought it was my husband.\\
444 - I'm going to go see what my boys...\\
445 - I mean, as if he would ever show me\\
446 - any kind of affection.\\
447 - I mean, as far as he's concerned,\\
448 - I am still the fat lady\\
449 - that answered his psychiatrist's phone.\\
450 - I mean, in my mind\\
451 - I do see myself as a 200-pounder.\\
452 - But I have seen the way that other men look at me.\\
453 - Wanda!\\
454 - Oh, it's so good to see you again.\\
455 - Wanda, this is Meg. Meg, this is Wanda.\\
456 - Why don't you two get to know each other.\\
457 - I'm going to get something to drink.\\
458 - I'll be right back.\\
459 - Um...\\
460 - So, how do you know Lois?\\
461 - Que?\\
462 - I like you. You're fun.\\
463 - I like you, too.\\
464 - Want some of my candy?\\
465 - But he... My... my candy!\\
466 - You fill up on that bread.\\
467 - Better you get sick on that than on candy.\\
468 - You understand me?\\
469 - I got enough to worry about\\
470 - without you going crazy on me.\\
471 - Stay here!\\
472 - Hi, Lois.\\
473 - Are you hiding back here?\\
474 - No, no. Just enjoying the shade.\\
475 - Did you meet your new boss yet?\\
476 - Yep. Well, how did it go?\\
477 - Fine. Good guy. We really hit it off.\\
478 - What happened?\\
479 - What do you mean, "What happened?"\\
480 - It went well. He likes me.\\
481 - Is that such a hard thing to imagine\\
482 - I made a good first impression?\\
483 - Hey, Mr. Landon!\\
484 - You should give me a little credit.\\
485 - Mr. Landon! Hey, boss!\\
486 - Is that man call...\\
487 - Of course he isn't.\\
488 - Whatever you were going to say--\\
489 - whatever that was-- he isn't.\\
490 - Hal, I'm not going anywhere until you ex...\\
491 - Lois! Lois!\\
492 - Excuse me.\\
493 - Mr. Landon!\\
494 - So, did I tell you\\
495 - that his mother is coming to visit me this week?\\
496 - I mean, she despises me, but at least she talks to me.\\
497 - My husband, on the other hand\\
498 - hasn't said two words besides "Where's the remote?"\\
499 - and "How far are those going to sag?"\\
500 - This really isn't a good time.\\
501 - And every year\\
502 - he has to go to this stupid get-together\\
503 - for his old friends from college.\\
504 - We're about to walk into this party\\
505 - and he turns to me\\
506 - and he tells me not to say anything stupid.\\
507 - Well, how's a person supposed to respond to that?\\
508 - I embarrass him one time.\\
509 - I mean, big deal\\
510 - I didn't know who Ernest Hemingway was.\\
511 - I mean a lot of people don't.\\
512 - All right, girls. Secure.\\
513 - Okay, Pete and Kathy, you're next.\\
514 - It's so great to see you again, Malcolm.\\
515 - Great to see you, too.\\
516 - For those of you without partners\\
517 - we've done a random pairing.\\
518 - Mike and Cristina.\\
519 - Reese and George.\\
520 - I'm Reese.\\
521 - I'm George.\\
522 - You can call me George.\\
523 - I can eat eight hot dogs.\\
524 - That's good, George.\\
525 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
526 - It's really weird being away\\
527 - from all my friends I grew up with.\\
528 - I'll bet.\\
529 - Malcolm, can I ask you something?\\
530 - Sure.\\
531 - If you liked somebody\\
532 - and you had no idea if they liked you back,\\
533 - would you say something?\\
534 - I've always thought honesty was a good thing.\\
535 - Me, too.\\
536 - But... what if they lived too far away\\
537 - and it'd be really hard?\\
538 - I like you, too, Laurie.\\
539 - I really, really like you.\\
540 - Honestly, you have no idea.\\
541 - I've liked you for years.\\
542 - I think about you all the time.\\
543 - Oh, no.\\
544 - What?\\
545 - Oh, my God.\\
546 - I am so sorry.\\
547 - I was talking about Gary Spindler.\\
548 - Oh, no.\\
549 - Oh. It's okay.\\
550 - No. This is so humiliating\\
551 - and it's all my fault.\\
552 - Oh, Malcolm, I am so sorry.\\
553 - Really, it's not that...\\
554 - Malcolm and Laurie.\\
555 - Now remember,\\
556 - you're only going to be tied together for three hours,\\
557 - so let's get hopping.
\subsection {Episode 12: Company Picnic (Part 2)}
1 - Previously on Malcolm in the Middle!\\
2 - It's a company picnic.\\
3 - Attended by my new boss whom I haven't met yet.\\
4 - I really like this girl.\\
5 - Please don't be a jerk and screw this up.\\
6 - Laurie, hi.\\
7 - It is so good to see you.\\
8 - Just keep moving.\\
9 - Hal, do you even know your new boss is here?\\
10 - Are you kidding? They're all here. There's Landon.\\
11 - He's the head of the whole company.\\
12 - I woke up the next morning with the dog licking my face.\\
13 - And I actually thought it was my husband.\\
14 - I'm going to go see what my boys...\\
15 - It is a real pleasure to meet you, Mr. Landon.\\
16 - Same here.\\
17 - You're playing girls?\\
18 - Well, the men won't play us\\
19 - till we beat their ladies team.\\
20 - You're responsible for these valuables till after the game.\\
21 - The other coach wants to make a little wager with you.\\
22 - I don't know what's with my skates.\\
23 - The blades are so dull.\\
24 - Hey, somebody unscrewed mine.\\
25 - If you liked somebody, would you say something?\\
26 - I like you, too, Laurie.\\
27 - Oh, my God. What?\\
28 - I was talking about Gary Spindler.\\
29 - Now remember, you're only gonna be tied together for three hours,\\
30 - so let's get hopping.\\
31 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
32 -     I don't know    \\
33 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
34 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
35 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
36 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
37 -     And you're not so big    \\
38 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
39 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
40 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
41 -     And you're not so big    \\
42 -     Life is unfair.    \\
43 - Wow, these are nice woods.\\
44 - Come on, Malcolm, we're still friends.\\
45 - We can still have fun, right?\\
46 - Why don't you help me with this clue?\\
47 - "North of the fork and up a small hill,\\
48 - under a joke without 'J' is a small yellow bill."\\
49 - This doesn't make any sense.\\
50 - You'd think these clues would make sense.\\
51 - Gary Spindler?\\
52 - Malcolm.\\
53 - Just tell me what you see in that jerk.\\
54 - He high-fives people\\
55 - when they decide what they want on their pizza.\\
56 - He still says, "It's da bomb."\\
57 - "Hi, I'm Gary Spindler. I have a laser pointer."\\
58 - I think he's nice.\\
59 - And can we just concentrate on the scavenger hunt?\\
60 - We're going to fall behind if we don't figure this out.\\
61 - It's a stupid yellow duck\\
62 - under that oak tree right there.\\
63 - Joke without "J"-- oke, oak tree.\\
64 - The fork was just back there.\\
65 - Wow, you were right.\\
66 - That was great, Malcolm.\\
67 - You know, you're really good at this.\\
68 - Yes, I am.\\
69 - I have a lot of other good qualities, too.\\
70 - In fact, there's lots of things people would like about me\\
71 - if they gave me half a chance.\\
72 - Can we just do this?\\
73 - Fine.\\
74 - Okay, clue number two.\\
75 - "Look for this gem on an overgrown hem,\\
76 - stay to your right or it might take all night."\\
77 - For God's sakes, Gary Spindler?!\\
78 - Whoo!\\
79 - What's going on out there?!\\
80 - We're down by two goals.\\
81 - I don't know. I can't get any speed with these skates.\\
82 - Well, get them sharpened.\\
83 - I already had Francis sharpen them twice.\\
84 - (coughing in rhythm with sawing)\\
85 - Besides, that number 32 is amazing.\\
86 - She's a monster.\\
87 - She's crippled our whole front line.\\
88 - Whoo!\\
89 - Sorry to take you away from your family, Mr. Landon.\\
90 - Listen, about this whole Mr. Landon thing...\\
91 - I know. I know, Burt.\\
92 - Listen, Burt, I need your help.\\
93 - The cubicle dwellers are getting a little restless.\\
94 - Oh...\\
95 - Apparently they know about my reputation for downsizing.\\
96 - I thought you could, uh, I don't know,\\
97 - shoot them a little B.S. to calm them down.\\
98 - Well, actually, I...\\
99 - Great. Hey, everybody!\\
100 - I know\\
101 - there are some concerns here.\\
102 - So I brought Mr. Landon over\\
103 - to put your minds at ease.\\
104 - Now remember, he's taking time away from his family,\\
105 - so not too many questions.\\
106 - This is beautiful.\\
107 - Hey, Phil, Mr. Landon over here\\
108 - would like to put our minds at ease.\\
109 - Isn't that right,  Burt?\\
110 - Hal?\\
111 - Burt. Albert. Halbert. Hal... you know...\\
112 - I'm sensing\\
113 - a lot of confusion here.\\
114 - But the key word to keep in mind is loyalty.\\
115 - When you're worried\\
116 - about your job, it's very tempting\\
117 - to make a fellow coworker look bad,\\
118 - but who really cares if someone's wife's an alcoholic?\\
119 - Or that someone has a certain unnatural attraction\\
120 - to women's shoes?\\
121 - The important thing is, we're in this together.\\
122 - And remember, nobody likes a snitch.\\
123 - So, let's have a great picnic, huh?\\
124 - "North of the fork and up a small hill,\\
125 - under a joke without 'J' is a small yellow bill."\\
126 - I don't see a fork, but I saw a broken spoon.\\
127 - Shut up. I'm trying to think of a joke\\
128 - without a lot of Js in it.\\
129 - Ooh, I found a cup.\\
130 - You're supposed to look for a fork.\\
131 - You know, a fork?\\
132 - The little thing with... things. Geez!\\
133 - You go. I'll stay here.\\
134 - We have to go together.\\
135 - We're tied to each other, you idiot.\\
136 - Cool, we got it.\\
137 - Five more and we win.\\
138 - Five more and we win.\\
139 - You're a genius.\\
140 - Thanks.\\
141 - You're, uh... big.\\
142 - Whoo!\\
143 - Yeah! Hey, Lavernia, looks like we're going to make it\\
144 - nine years in a row!\\
145 - Maybe we should put some of our\\
146 - pregnant girls in there and make it more of a game.\\
147 - Now, who-who is that helping?\\
148 - All that's going to do is make her feel bad,\\
149 - plus now all our pregnant girls\\
150 - are going to want to get in the game.\\
151 - Number 32 is killing us!\\
152 - Looks like it's time for a little strategy.\\
153 - Whoo, whoo, whoo.\\
154 - Whoo-hoo!\\
155 - Eric!\\
156 - Yeah!\\
157 - Now let's play some hockey!\\
158 - You were amazing out there.\\
159 - I would have never found those kids without you.\\
160 - You know something?\\
161 - Together we make the perfect three-legged person.\\
162 - I wish we could stay like this forever.\\
163 - Yeah.\\
164 - Wait a minute.\\
165 - Why can't we?\\
166 - There's people that do surgeries.\\
167 - You're the smartest guy I've ever met.\\
168 - Thanks, buddy.\\
169 - Come on, we got to find that fork.\\
170 - He... I... But... He...!\\
171 - What did I tell you?\\
172 - You sit in that chair until the picnic is over.\\
173 - Excuse me. Are you Lois?\\
174 - Yes. Where do you get off\\
175 - talking to my wife about my mother?\\
176 - Look... I'll have you know\\
177 - that I wet my bed every night till I was 16,\\
178 - and my mother changed those sheets for years\\
179 - and never said a word.\\
180 - I don't care if they don't get along.\\
181 - My mother's important to me.\\
182 - Hey, I never said anything about your mother.\\
183 - And by the way, I don't have a porn problem.\\
184 - Did she tell you that she was the one\\
185 - to introduce it into our home?\\
186 - You know, I don't have any interest in your...\\
187 - It was her idea, and now I'm the pervert.\\
188 - I don't know what it is about porn.\\
189 - Maybe it's the safety of emotional distance\\
190 - or maybe it's just the thrill of...\\
191 - All right, that's it!\\
192 - If you're going to make me do this,\\
193 - we're going to do this.\\
194 - Now sit down!\\
195 - Your problem is you both see yourselves as victims.\\
196 - You've got to talk to each other.\\
197 - There's a certain thing called give and take\\
198 - you need to make a relationship work.\\
199 - Do you understand?\\
200 - Yes.\\
201 - I'm not finished with you!\\
202 - Now, if you are going to make this work,\\
203 - you have to make sure\\
204 - that you are home every night at 6:30.\\
205 - Not 6:35. Not 6:31.\\
206 - You have got to create an atmosphere of trust.\\
207 - Go, go!\\
208 - Yeah!\\
209 - Hey, I'm starting to think\\
210 - we might actually win this thing.\\
211 - Damn right we will.\\
212 - I got 600 bucks riding on it.\\
213 - Francis, what are you doing out here?\\
214 - You're a man short.\\
215 - Where's Amos?\\
216 - He ran out of here, screaming something about\\
217 - government helicopters and murderous clones.\\
218 - Hello? Is anybody there?\\
219 - Don't worry. I'll cover for him.\\
220 - All right. You're a good man, Francis.\\
221 - Hey, I'm just doing what anybody would do.\\
222 - Sorry.\\
223 - Hey, look at this.\\
224 - We're doing great.\\
225 - You're so good at this.\\
226 - Stop! What are you doing?\\
227 - I'm sorry.\\
228 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry!\\
229 - So, just tell me\\
230 - what's your big problem with me?\\
231 - Malcolm. No, seriously.\\
232 - I want to know.\\
233 - Am I too short?\\
234 - Am I too smart?\\
235 - Malcolm, can we please drop this?\\
236 - I'm smart, okay? Is that a crime?\\
237 - I'm sorry I'm not a moron like Gary Spindler.\\
238 - Malcolm, stop it.\\
239 - What are you doing?\\
240 - I want you to tell me why you don't like me.\\
241 - Why are you doing this?\\
242 - I want a straight answer.\\
243 - God! I can't believe I liked you in the third grade.\\
244 - You liked me in the third grade?\\
245 - I knew it! I wasn't crazy. You did like me.\\
246 - So, what the hell has changed? Tell me.\\
247 - I defy you to tell me.\\
248 - Nothing! That's the problem.\\
249 - You're still the same\\
250 - obsessive, whining know-it-all\\
251 - who doesn't listen to anyone.\\
252 - But you did like me in the third grade?\\
253 - Malcolm, I  don't  like you.\\
254 - Can you get that through your head?\\
255 - Before...\\
256 - I just didn't have a crush on you.\\
257 - And now I can't stand you.\\
258 - So, you want me to tell you why I don't like you?\\
259 - You want me to tell you why I like nice, funny Gary Spindler\\
260 - and absolutely despise bitter, annoying Malcolm, do you?!\\
261 - Look... Well, I'm going tell you!\\
262 - There is something wrong with you!\\
263 - I don't know how you do it.\\
264 - You're cute, smart, funny,\\
265 - and somehow you manage to mess that up!\\
266 - Like today,\\
267 - it was an awkward situation\\
268 - but it would have passed,\\
269 - but you just kept picking at it and picking at it\\
270 - until it turned into this big, horrible thing!\\
271 - There is something wrong inside you!\\
272 - There is something rotten\\
273 - at the core of your personality!\\
274 - You're just off!\\
275 - That's not even the worst thing...\\
276 - I... but... she...\\
277 - I just opened my purse to get a Tic Tac,\\
278 - and he dropped out of a tree on my back!\\
279 - I am so sorry.\\
280 - Now, you go and you sit down in that chair\\
281 - and you put your head down!\\
282 - Okay.\\
283 - Did you straighten things out with Pratt?\\
284 - Almost.\\
285 - Oh, for God's sake, Hal, where is he?\\
286 - I'll go talk to him.\\
287 - No, no, no, no, no! It's too late now.\\
288 - It would be awkward.\\
289 - Hal, you work with the man. He's going to find out.\\
290 - Look, it'll be, like, two seconds\\
291 - of embarrassment and then it's over.\\
292 - Now go!\\
293 - Pratt, do you have a moment?\\
294 - For you, Burt, of course.\\
295 - You're fired. What?\\
296 - I don't think it's working out,\\
297 - so let's just make a clean break.\\
298 - I haven't even started yet.\\
299 - What could you possibly be basing this on?\\
300 - My gut-- I didn't get this far without trusting my instincts.\\
301 - I'm sorry, son.\\
302 - I think it's best if you just leave the picnic now.\\
303 - They have some sort of foil if you want to wrap that up.\\
304 - I'm so sorry, Malcolm. I just started talking\\
305 - and I couldn't stop and I said all those mean things.\\
306 - I didn't even mean half of them.\\
307 - Who am I to say that your kids will be screwed up?\\
308 - I mean, you might not even have kids.\\
309 - Are you okay?\\
310 - I think I can stop crying now.\\
311 - Can you hand me more leaves?\\
312 - Oh, Malcolm...\\
313 - No, really, I'll be fine.\\
314 - No, Malcolm, that's poison oak.\\
315 - Of course it is.\\
316 - Aw, geez, guys-- my bad.\\
317 - How could I have done that?!\\
318 - Ah, don't beat yourself up, buddy.\\
319 - We all make mistakes.\\
320 - Shake it off.\\
321 - You're doing your best.\\
322 - Eric, I'm doing terrible.\\
323 - Why is everybody being so nice to me?\\
324 - You're doing your best, man.\\
325 - You're part of the team now.\\
326 - Good or bad, we're in this together.\\
327 - Okay, it looks like you boys\\
328 - have all the items on the list here,\\
329 - plus a wallet, a girl's bracelet and a fork.\\
330 - Just give us the hundred bucks.\\
331 - There you go.\\
332 - Thanks.\\
333 - Now, how about we separate you two?\\
334 - I'll miss you.\\
335 - Nice.\\
336 - Mom, you don't have to hold on to me.\\
337 - I'll be good.\\
338 - Okay. Lois...\\
339 - You don't have to thank me.\\
340 - Let me just enjoy the rest of the picnic with my family.\\
341 - You told my husband that I was insane?\\
342 - You told him that I should be committed?\\
343 - I didn't say that. And how does letting him\\
344 - videotape us in bed help our marriage?\\
345 - What?! I didn't tell...\\
346 - Listen, lady, you got to stop this!\\
347 - I don't have time for\\
348 - my own family's problems\\
349 - without listening to you two nutcases!\\
350 - So, why don't you just...\\
351 - I don't think you understood me.\\
352 - Oh!\\
353 - Ow!\\
354 - Oh!\\
355 - Come on, buddy, this is it!\\
356 - We can do this! Just get in there!\\
357 - You know, I don't think I can...\\
358 - Eric, there's something I got to tell...\\
359 - Damn it, get up!\\
360 - Do something!\\
361 - No!\\
362 - Eric, you okay?\\
363 - Someone took the cup out of my jock.\\
364 - I'll be fine.\\
365 - Just win this thing.\\
366 - Now, just to be clear,\\
367 - I'm not looking for anything long-term here.\\
368 -        \\
369 -        \\
370 - Yes!\\
371 - Yeah!\\
372 - You did it, man!\\
373 - Way to go!\\
374 - Let me collect my money\\
375 - so we can treat Francis the way he deserves.\\
376 - You know, there's a funny story about that money.\\
377 - You boys did all right.\\
378 - Yeah, it was pretty fun.\\
379 - Hey, Francis, how you doing out there?\\
380 - Well, cold!\\
381 - Won't be much longer.\\
382 - There's a kid's skating party in a half-hour!\\
383 - Dewey!\\
384 - Dewey, is that... Oh, my God!\\
385 - Dewey, get away from there.\\
386 - All right, all right.\\
387 - Everything's going to be all right.\\
388 - Come on, baby.\\
389 - Come to...\\
390 - Mama!\\
391 - Everything's going to be okay.\\
392 - Everything's going to be okay.\\
393 - Everything's going to be...\\
394 - Who was that idiot who just pulled out\\
395 - and flipped everyone off?\\
396 - That's Pratt, sir.\\
397 - He starts this week.\\
398 - No, no, the only thing he starts this week\\
399 - is a long lifetime of misery.\\
400 - You have our friends at the IRS give him a call.\\
401 - So maybe we can hang out sometime or something.\\
402 - I mean, when you're better.\\
403 - Oh, come on, Malcolm.\\
404 - It's not that bad.\\
405 - Give me a smile.\\
406 - Are you smiling?\\
407 - I can't tell.\\
408 - I'm smiling.\\
409 - Well, that went better than expected.
\subsection {Episode 13: Reese Drives}
1 - Dewey!\\
2 - Come on out, honey!\\
3 - How did he find out he was going\\
4 - to the doctor this morning?\\
5 - Well, I certainly didn't say anything.\\
6 - Dewey!\\
7 - Son?\\
8 - Dewey!\\
9 - Dewey, come on out!\\
10 - We love you, son!\\
11 - Dewey, come on, we're going to be late.\\
12 - Oh... poor little thing.\\
13 - Go start the car.\\
14 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
15 -     I don't know    \\
16 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - Awesome dinner, Mom.\\
27 - Those are the best fish sticks\\
28 - I've had in my entire life.\\
29 - Seriously, I don't know how you do it.\\
30 - The microwave.\\
31 - But for the perfect amount of time.\\
32 - Well, I better clear my plate\\
33 - and get started on my homework.\\
34 - At first, I thought it was a brain tumor,\\
35 - but tomorrow, he's old enough\\
36 - to get his learner's permit.\\
37 - He's on his best behavior\\
38 - until after he passes the test.\\
39 - Can I get anyone a nice cup of peppermint tea?\\
40 - Helps digestion.\\
41 - Mom and Dad have been looking\\
42 - for any excuse to ground him,\\
43 - but he hasn't screwed up once\\
44 - in, like, three weeks.\\
45 - It's actually getting kind of boring.\\
46 - Ow!\\
47 - Didn't think so.\\
48 - Remember, Dad, you're picking me up\\
49 - from school tomorrow to take me to the DMV.\\
50 - I wouldn't miss it, son.\\
51 - Dear God, what are we going to do?\\
52 - What can we do?\\
53 - He hasn't done anything wrong.\\
54 - Oh, please, it's Reese.\\
55 - We just haven't looked hard enough.\\
56 - Hal, we're going to have to face it.\\
57 - That kid is going to be mobile.\\
58 - Reese surrounded by 6,000 pounds of steel\\
59 - and 20 gallons of explosive fuel.\\
60 - It's like giving a shark a submachine gun.\\
61 - I'll get it.\\
62 - Hello.\\
63 - Hey, Dad.\\
64 - Francis, hi, how are you?\\
65 - We haven't heard from you in so long.\\
66 - Yeah, well,\\
67 - you know how I've always been kind of impulsive\\
68 - and independent-minded, but basically\\
69 - just unlucky?\\
70 - What?\\
71 - Well, there's been a certain incident here,\\
72 - and without getting bogged down by the blame game,\\
73 - let's just say there have been some damages.\\
74 - That's why you're calling?\\
75 - Francis, no, you can't do that anymore.\\
76 - You're on your own.\\
77 - You've emancipated yourself, remember?\\
78 - You can't come running back to your parents for money\\
79 - at the first sign of trouble anymore.\\
80 - I'm not running to my parents.\\
81 - I'm calling as one adult to another\\
82 - for an adult... loan.\\
83 - No. No, you've made whatever mess you've made\\
84 - and you take care of it.\\
85 - I have been taking care of it.\\
86 - I already got Big Red to cut me the lumber\\
87 - in exchange for a pair of fur-lined boots.\\
88 - I got my friend Pete to make the boots\\
89 - but only because I promised him\\
90 - a new set of teeth\\
91 - and, as you probably know, teeth don't come cheap\\
92 - and that's where you...\\
93 - Hey, Dave, you know that digital camera\\
94 - that Bernie got that you like so much?\\
95 - Yeah?\\
96 - Well, what would you pay\\
97 - if I could get it for you?\\
98 - You can get Bernie to give up his camera?\\
99 - Absolutely.\\
100 - I've been waiting for this my whole life.\\
101 - Once I'm driving, everything changes.\\
102 - All I have to do is stay out of trouble for the next 16 hours\\
103 - and I'm home free.\\
104 - How's that?\\
105 - A little tighter on this side.\\
106 - Okay, you're all set.\\
107 - Now, remember, do not untie me until the morning,\\
108 - no matter what I say or how much I beg.\\
109 - Got it.\\
110 - Uh-oh. I got to go to the bathroom.\\
111 - Too bad.\\
112 - Just testing.\\
113 - Thanks, buddy.\\
114 - It's weird, but Reese suddenly doesn't seem\\
115 - as irritating as he used to.\\
116 - It's amazing what a driver's license\\
117 - can do for a relationship.\\
118 - Hi.\\
119 - Dewey, I am warning you.\\
120 - If you even touch me,\\
121 - you can forget about me ever driving you anywhere\\
122 - for the rest of your life.\\
123 - I have nowhere to go.\\
124 - Hello.\\
125 - Hi, Lois, it's Craig.\\
126 - Craig, I can't talk right now.\\
127 - I'm on the other line.\\
128 - It's okay, this will only take a second.\\
129 - I have something to say to you\\
130 - that I only feel comfortable saying\\
131 - because we're like family.\\
132 - Your son Malcolm is a filthy vandal.\\
133 - What?\\
134 - He threw eggs all over the front of my new apartment--\\
135 - him and his little wheelchair friend.\\
136 - They wanted some free Lucky Aide candy.\\
137 - I said no. The next thing I know, it's like D-Day here.\\
138 - Malcolm! Get in here!\\
139 - You'd think I'd be the last person he'd target\\
140 - after I forgave your family for burning my old place down,\\
141 - which, I'd like to remind you again, I hardly ever mention.\\
142 - Craig, I am so sorry.\\
143 - Well, boys will be boys.\\
144 - All I want is for him to come over and clean it up,\\
145 - and if he could stop and get me a nonfat latte along the way\\
146 - that would be great.\\
147 - Don't worry, he's on his way.\\
148 - What is the matter with you?!\\
149 - Throwing eggs at Craig's front door?\\
150 - What are you talking about?\\
151 - I did it. I did it.\\
152 - You passed the test?\\
153 - I aced it.\\
154 - You got five wrong.\\
155 - Yeah, but I got 11 right, and that's good enough\\
156 - for my learner's permit.\\
157 - Man, if the DMV was running my school,\\
158 - I'd be, like, a "C" student.\\
159 - Well, congratulations.\\
160 - Dad, you sent that check to the driving school, right?\\
161 - Yes, Reese.\\
162 - You're sure you signed it.\\
163 - It's not going to bounce or anything?\\
164 - Everything is fine, Reese.\\
165 - Just go there straight after school tomorrow.\\
166 - You guys are the best.\\
167 - I promise when you're old and crazy,\\
168 - I'll drive to the home and visit you.\\
169 - Maybe we could go for a drive around the park.\\
170 - Would you like that?\\
171 - I can't wait.\\
172 - Why are you still here?\\
173 - Get over to Craig's.\\
174 - Start cleaning.\\
175 - Mom, I didn't throw anything\\
176 - at his front door, I swear.\\
177 - Malcolm, why would a grown man lie\\
178 - about something like that?\\
179 - I lied because I needed your help.\\
180 - I finally got my insurance settlement.\\
181 - This receiver works in both SRS 5.1 and DTS.\\
182 - Unidirectional subwoofer for surround sound.\\
183 - Progressive-scan DVD player.\\
184 - Plays both AIFF and MP3 formats on either CDs or CD-Rs.\\
185 - I figured you'd be comfortable\\
186 - with this level of electronics.\\
187 - I mean, the guys at the store\\
188 - couldn't find their graphic equalizers\\
189 - with two hands and a flashlight.\\
190 - You dragged me over here to hook up your stereo?\\
191 - Can't you get one of your friends to help you do this?\\
192 - And tick off the other friends I didn't ask?\\
193 - Malcolm, this goes far beyond just a stereo.\\
194 - This is going to be\\
195 - the greatest entertainment center ever.\\
196 - Have you ever wanted to be the best at something?\\
197 - Not just good, I don't mean great,\\
198 - I mean the absolute best?\\
199 - I don't know.\\
200 - Well, I have.\\
201 - Ever since I was a kid watching Land of the Lost\\
202 - on my tiny black-and-white six-inch,\\
203 - I knew there'd be a day...\\
204 - a day when I could create my own high-def universe...\\
205 - a magical realm where fantasy and technology\\
206 - intersect at my every whim\\
207 - because I am the king.\\
208 - So your lifelong dream\\
209 - was to become the world's best TV watcher?\\
210 - Yeah.\\
211 - I'm in.\\
212 - I still can't believe it.\\
213 - For the first time ever, I'm going to be...\\
214 - behind the wheel.\\
215 - He keeps doing that.\\
216 - Mom, I have to go to Craig's today after school.\\
217 - You still have more to clean up?\\
218 - Yeah, I made a hell of a mess.\\
219 - Hey, Dewey, I want you to know\\
220 - there's no hard feelings\\
221 - about the last couple of weeks.\\
222 - Because you're going to suffer every day\\
223 - for the next ten years.\\
224 - Yep, brand-new.\\
225 - College boy got 'em for me.\\
226 - Warm, are they? Oh, yeah.\\
227 - Oh, this is awesome.\\
228 - Willie's grandson is really going to love this.\\
229 - Just remember, you got to get that sled team\\
230 - out to Camp Three for me before dark.\\
231 - Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\\
232 - You've driven dogs before, right?\\
233 - Because it gets pretty tricky.\\
234 - What do I look like?\\
235 - Stop worrying.\\
236 - Hey, Neil, you know how to drive a dog team, right?\\
237 - Yeah.\\
238 - Do you still have a crush on Joe's sister?\\
239 - Yeah, but Joe won't let me date her\\
240 - just 'cause I'm Irish and I got a bounty on my head.\\
241 - Let me see what I can do.\\
242 - Sorry.\\
243 - Sorry.\\
244 - Sorry.\\
245 - Ooh, sorry.\\
246 - I'm sorry.\\
247 - Ooh, sorry.\\
248 - Damn it.\\
249 - I thought I paid this gas bill already.\\
250 - You're doing great.\\
251 - Turn right up here.\\
252 - I think you're ready for street driving.\\
253 - What?! Jackie's been driving for half an hour.\\
254 - Her turn is over.\\
255 - It's only been ten minutes, Reese.\\
256 - No, it hasn't-- I've been timing you.\\
257 - You've been driving exactly 27 minutes.\\
258 - You're going to start using up my turn.\\
259 - When did you learn how to tell time?\\
260 - Faced. It's digital.\\
261 - I can't believe I have to be in the same car\\
262 - as a low-life like you.\\
263 - Oh, I'm a low-life?\\
264 - You're the one that spends ever day at lunch\\
265 - sucking on a straw that's been under my armpit.\\
266 - You pig!\\
267 - That's it. I've had it.\\
268 - I don't even know what text-messaging is.\\
269 - How can they charge me 15 bucks a month for it?\\
270 - Malcolm.\\
271 - You can't connect those cables.\\
272 - Their impedance values aren't equal.\\
273 - You'll get a reflected transmission.\\
274 - That's what the high-speed scan modulation is for.\\
275 - Trust me, 480p is\\
276 - more than enough to take care of it.\\
277 - But then I can't use the analog pre-amp to play my SACDs.\\
278 - You're tired. You're not thinking right.\\
279 - Did it ever occur to you that I might be using\\
280 - single-ended interconnects for the front left-right speakers?\\
281 - Are you mad?\\
282 - You can't do that.\\
283 - Just watch me.\\
284 - I know it sounds weird, but this is\\
285 - the most fulfilling conversation I've had in weeks.\\
286 - Isn't there supposed to be some signal\\
287 - that tells the other cars to get out of the way?\\
288 - Does anyone see a thingy\\
289 - of one-cent stamps by their feet?\\
290 - It's been 45 minutes.\\
291 - I'm not going to get my turn.\\
292 - Okay, pull over.\\
293 - Finally.\\
294 - I just need to go to the post office.\\
295 - Oh, God, look at that line.\\
296 - What are you doing?\\
297 - It's my turn.\\
298 - Oh, sorry, Reese, it doesn't look\\
299 - like we'll have enough time,\\
300 - but you got very valuable watching experience.\\
301 - We'll get to you next week.\\
302 - Slide over.\\
303 - No way.\\
304 - Ugh.\\
305 - I at least get to drive back\\
306 - to the stupid school.\\
307 - I'm not going home without at least\\
308 - touching the steering wheel.\\
309 - What was that?\\
310 - You crashed.\\
311 - No, I didn't.\\
312 - The car's not even in drive.\\
313 - Yeah, well,\\
314 - you're behind the wheel.\\
315 - What are you going to do now, hotshot?\\
316 - I'm so sorry, I...\\
317 - So, let's see.\\
318 - We've got grand theft auto,\\
319 - malicious crashing and what else?\\
320 - Oh, yeah, kidnapping me.\\
321 - I always knew you'd go to prison.\\
322 - I just figured it'd be after prom.\\
323 - Will you shut up and let me think about this?\\
324 - Do you realize you are driving 20 miles an hour on a freeway?\\
325 - Hey, I'm not getting a speeding ticket\\
326 - on top of everything else.\\
327 - Now will you just leave me alone for a couple of minutes\\
328 - and let me figure this out?\\
329 - Ha!\\
330 - Okay, don't panic.\\
331 - It's just a cop. That's nothing.\\
332 - You can handle one stupid cop.\\
333 - Oh, man.\\
334 - What are you doing?\\
335 - Aren't you pulling over?\\
336 - I don't know.\\
337 - I think I'm still going.\\
338 - Reese, if you're being chased by the cops\\
339 - and they say "pull over," you have to do it.\\
340 - That's a law.\\
341 - Yeah, well, even so.\\
342 - You can't...\\
343 - You know, that's a really good plan, Reese.\\
344 - I just see one little problem with it.\\
345 - This is a Driver's Ed car!\\
346 - Those cheap sons of...\\
347 - There no sense screaming to me about Francis.\\
348 - I haven't seen him.\\
349 - I spent five hours digging post holes\\
350 - because he promised me a satellite dish.\\
351 - He promised me a satellite dish.\\
352 - And where the hell is my George Foreman grill?\\
353 - I'm just as mad as the rest of you.\\
354 - I'm pretty sure these teeth came off a dead guy.\\
355 - Taste like a Canadian.\\
356 - Well, he's through taking advantage of me,\\
357 - I can tell you that.\\
358 - Well, Pierre, your identical American cousin\\
359 - is in a heap of trouble.\\
360 - Oui.\\
361 - Another half turn. Easy, easy...\\
362 - Don't strip it.\\
363 - Got it.\\
364 - Beautiful.\\
365 - Now all we have to do is adjust it and we're done.\\
366 - Congratulations.\\
367 - I got to admit, it was pretty hairy there.\\
368 - Especially with those hub connectors.\\
369 - Stripping that extra quarter inch\\
370 - off the copper leads was inspired.\\
371 - I hardly even remember it.\\
372 - I was running on pure adrenaline.\\
373 - You know what, Craig, I got to tell you,\\
374 - this was a lot of fun.\\
375 - I actually enjoyed spending time with you.\\
376 - You didn't have to lie to get me over here.\\
377 - Yes, I did.\\
378 - Yeah, okay.\\
379 - But you wouldn't now.\\
380 - I guess what I'm trying to say is, you know...\\
381 - I'm sorry for all the times we made you miserable.\\
382 - It's okay.\\
383 - You're a good guy.\\
384 - I like you.\\
385 - Run down and check the signal, will you?\\
386 - Okay.\\
387 - And try not to screw it up...\\
388 - buddy.\\
389 - We're getting 42%.\\
390 - Try moving the dish a little to the right.\\
391 - A little more. 57...\\
392 - Up a little more.\\
393 - 61...\\
394 - ...a low speed chase involving a teenager,\\
395 - a Driver's Ed car\\
396 - and what appears to be a hostage.\\
397 - It all happened so fast.\\
398 - He just took off.\\
399 - With my checkbook and all my financial papers in the car.\\
400 - That's not an excuse.\\
401 - I just hope that B of A understands the situation.\\
402 - Although the hostage seems to be unharmed,\\
403 - it's only a matter of time before the police decide\\
404 - to end it one way or the other.\\
405 - Oh, no!\\
406 - Now they're never going to let me drive.\\
407 - How's it looking?\\
408 - Malcolm?\\
409 - Malcolm?!\\
410 - I can't hear you.\\
411 - You're not watching without me, are you?\\
412 - Malcolm!\\
413 - Malcolm!\\
414 - (reporter speaks indistinctly on TV)\\
415 - Just let me talk to him\\
416 - and I can end this in five minutes.\\
417 - I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't think that's a good idea.\\
418 - We have trained psychologists\\
419 - to handle kids in these situations.\\
420 - We know how they think.\\
421 - Think? My son doesn't think.\\
422 - He's just driving around in circles.\\
423 - He's made three laps around the city already.\\
424 - There's our dry cleaner again.\\
425 - Here's another picture of my brother\\
426 - you can show on TV.\\
427 - Just get him on the phone and let me handle this.\\
428 - I'm the only one who knows how.\\
429 - Trust me, we have this under control.\\
430 - Don't think I don't know what's going to happen.\\
431 - You're going to do your standard police thing\\
432 - and my son is going to get killed in a hail of gunfire.\\
433 - Ma'am, that almost never happens.\\
434 - Just get him on the phone!\\
435 - And you tell him, if he ever wants to see daylight again,\\
436 - he'll pull over this instant!\\
437 - Your mother wants you to know\\
438 - that she loves you and...\\
439 - He has ten seconds to pull over that damn car, or I will...\\
440 - ...give you lots of hugs and kisses.\\
441 - You heard your mom, you're not in trouble.\\
442 - Can you pull over now?\\
443 - That's not my mom.\\
444 - Please, dear God...\\
445 - I know I haven't been a saint, but I swear if you...\\
446 - No, Daddy, this is not my fault.\\
447 - I'm just a passenger.\\
448 - How is this making you look like a chump?\\
449 - I'm the one...\\
450 - Hold on.\\
451 - Hello? No.\\
452 - No, I'm on the other line.\\
453 - If you want to talk to him so bad,\\
454 - use the bullhorn thingy.\\
455 - Hi, I'm back.\\
456 - No, I was not talking to Mom. It was the...\\
457 - Daddy, I don't care who she's...\\
458 - No, I will not tell her.\\
459 - You have to stop putting me in...\\
460 - Go ahead, you know what? Go ahead\\
461 - cancel the card... cancel all my cards.\\
462 - I'm going to be in this car for the rest of my life anyway.\\
463 - Okay, I've got an idea. What?\\
464 - There's a railroad crossing about a mile ahead.\\
465 - If we jump out a split second\\
466 - before the train squashes the car,\\
467 - we can start new lives as circus people.\\
468 - Reese, come on. This is getting scary.\\
469 - What are you going to do?\\
470 - This is your last warning.\\
471 - Pull over or you will be forced from the road.\\
472 - Jackie, I have to tell you something.\\
473 - Just because I hate you,\\
474 - doesn't mean I'm not sorry.\\
475 - What?\\
476 - I didn't mean to get you into this.\\
477 - It's just that I'm not, you know, I'm not very smart.\\
478 - So when I get in trouble, I panic\\
479 - and then I do things that make it worse.\\
480 - I'm really sorry.\\
481 - And your dad is a tool.\\
482 - Hey, I was just kidding about the kidnapping thing.\\
483 - I mean, you have enough to worry about\\
484 - without me being a jerk about it, right?\\
485 - Wait a second.\\
486 - Jackie, give me your phone.\\
487 - I have a brother who's a total genius.\\
488 - He'll know what to do.\\
489 - How many police cars are chasing you?\\
490 - I don't know, eight, maybe nine.\\
491 - What are we going to do? There's no way out of this.\\
492 - Hey, don't give up.\\
493 - Sometimes things look their darkest\\
494 - right before the sun breaks through.\\
495 - And sometimes you just have to realize that the game is over\\
496 - and that you've lost. The...\\
497 - The only thing left to do is to stop running, stand up\\
498 - and face the consequences like a man. And...\\
499 - And even if the outcome is going to be more horrible\\
500 - than you could've possibly imagined,\\
501 - you can hold your head up high, show some class\\
502 - and end it with dignity.\\
503 - Class.\\
504 - For the love of God, not the stump rooter!\\
505 - No!\\
506 - Where is he going?\\
507 - He's turning.\\
508 -        \\
509 - Wow. Nice.\\
510 - It was.\\
511 - Okay, that's impressive.\\
512 - Look, he's pulling over.\\
513 - I think he's going to parallel park.\\
514 - No way.\\
515 - The spot is way too small.\\
516 - He's going too fast and he hasn't given himself\\
517 - enough space on the right!\\
518 - He did it. Now just get out of the damn car, please.\\
519 - Reese, that was amazing.\\
520 - Listen, when the kids at school ask you about this...\\
521 - tell them I got under your bra.\\
522 - I'll call the lawyer and have him meet us there.\\
523 - Cuff him.\\
524 - Give them a reason. Give them a reason.\\
525 - The suspect appears to be resisting.\\
526 - Oh, looks like they're taking out the pepper spray.\\
527 - Why do we have to get dressed like this?\\
528 - It's Reese's hearing.\\
529 - Because when the judge looks over at us,\\
530 - I want him to see that Reese comes from a respectable family\\
531 - that loves him very much.\\
532 - Why aren't they trying him as an adult?\\
533 - Come on, we got to go.\\
534 - I have to go to Craig's after.\\
535 - Jellybean is getting his cast off\\
536 - and he wants me to videotape it.\\
537 - Craig's talking already? Good for him.\\
538 - I was really creeped out about that whole\\
539 - "one blink, yes, two blinks, no" stuff.\\
540 - No, you got it the other way around, Hal.\\
541 - One blink means "no."\\
542 - So the soup  was  too hot.
\subsection {Episode 14: Cynthia's Back}
1 - My turn.\\
2 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
3 - I had no idea homework could be so funny.\\
4 - It's suicide.\\
5 - I don't care, I'm going in.\\
6 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
7 -     I don't know    \\
8 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     Life is unfair.    \\
18 - Guess what.\\
19 - I just got back from the doctor.\\
20 - My spine is curved!\\
21 - How bad? No gym for two years.\\
22 - This is brilliant.\\
23 - I wonder if my third nipple can get me out of wrestling.\\
24 - It's worth a shot.\\
25 - Here comes...\\
26 - her royal...\\
27 - bitchiness.\\
28 - Cynthia just got back from a semester in New York\\
29 - and she's totally changed.\\
30 - She always used to be so happy.\\
31 - Now it's like she's given up on life.\\
32 - She's bitter and sarcastic.\\
33 - I mean, I could pull it off,\\
34 - but on her it's really unpleasant.\\
35 - Malcolm, can you ask your lemmings to move the herd\\
36 - an inch to the left so I could get past?\\
37 - I'm sorry, did you say "inch"?\\
38 - Don't you mean 2.54 centimeters?\\
39 - Or .254 decimeters?\\
40 - Or 25.4 million nanometers?\\
41 - Come on, guys, stop teasing her.\\
42 - You stink at it.\\
43 - Don't defend her, Malcolm.\\
44 - If I wanted this kind of abuse,\\
45 - I'd have a conversation with my oboe teacher.\\
46 - She's... dead... to us.\\
47 - Hey, are you okay?\\
48 - What are you talking about? What do you mean?\\
49 - Well, you've been acting kind of strange lately.\\
50 - Malcolm, look around you\\
51 - and reconsider your definition of strange.\\
52 - Over 12% deviation from vertical.\\
53 - Fair enough.\\
54 - Dad, look how high my kite is.\\
55 - Oh, that's great, son.\\
56 - That's terrific.\\
57 - You want to try?\\
58 - Uh, no. Why not?\\
59 - I don't like kites.\\
60 - What do you mean you don't like kites?\\
61 - I don't like kites and they don't like me.\\
62 - We-we just don't get along.\\
63 - You'd like it if you tried it.\\
64 - Come on. Just try it.\\
65 - Hold the string.\\
66 - Hey, Lois.\\
67 - Karen, what are you doing out there?\\
68 - Come on in.\\
69 - I'm sorry.\\
70 - I didn't mean to lurk.\\
71 - I was working up the nerve to talk to you.\\
72 - Are you okay?\\
73 - You look different.\\
74 - I'm sober.\\
75 - Oh.\\
76 - Yeah, after I drove across that miniature golf course,\\
77 - they made me get into a 12-step program, so...\\
78 - Good for you.\\
79 - Yeah, thanks. I'm doing really great.\\
80 - Anyway, I'm up to the part\\
81 - where I'm supposed to make amends\\
82 - to the people that I've hurt.\\
83 - What did you ever do to me?\\
84 - Remember New Year's at Deb and Rich's\\
85 - where everyone was kissing at midnight?\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - Well, when I kissed your husband,\\
88 - I kind of... stuck my tongue in his mouth.\\
89 - I mean, I felt really terrible.\\
90 - And then after that\\
91 - I put my cigarette out in Rich's toupee.\\
92 - And those things go up so quickly, I had...\\
93 - You were French-kissing my husband?\\
94 - Don't be mad at him, Lois.\\
95 - He pushed me away after like five or six seconds.\\
96 - Well, it was definitely no more than ten.\\
97 - And I'm sure the only reason\\
98 - he was moving his tongue around\\
99 - was because he was trying to say something.\\
100 - That's enough, Karen.\\
101 - I-I-I get it.\\
102 - I'm sorry.\\
103 - Now I have to go over to Stephanie's\\
104 - and tell her she can take down those lost dog posters.\\
105 - Come on, Francis.\\
106 - It's Friday night.\\
107 - Can we please go out and get hammered?\\
108 - Is getting drunk all you ever think about?\\
109 - I mean, look at us.\\
110 - We work like dogs all day.\\
111 - We drink and then we work like hungover dogs.\\
112 - Is this really how you pictured your life?\\
113 - Ever since I was little.\\
114 - Why, what'd you picture?\\
115 - I don't know.\\
116 - There's just got to be more to life\\
117 - than getting falling-down drunk\\
118 - and behaving like a jackass.\\
119 - Just looky what we found.\\
120 - You stole a totem pole? No, no, no,\\
121 - he asked to come with us.\\
122 - He hasn't shut up for an hour.\\
123 - You can't leave this here.\\
124 - People worship these things.\\
125 - It's like a sacred object.\\
126 - Do I have something in my teeth?\\
127 - Be honest.\\
128 - What is wrong with you people?!\\
129 - You see a symbol of a world\\
130 - beyond scraping grease, and your first thought is,\\
131 - let's profane it in our cabin?\\
132 - Don't you have any respect for anything?!\\
133 - Look, a penny.\\
134 - It's mine!\\
135 - I saw it first!\\
136 - Is my coffee ready yet?\\
137 - I can't believe you only have instant.\\
138 - I'm sorry our "Fol-g  rs" isn't up to your standards.\\
139 - And I'd be a little more impressed\\
140 - with your coffee-drinking sophistication\\
141 - if you weren't wearing a kitty sweater.\\
142 - I'm supposed to take style tips\\
143 - from someone who keeps track of wrestling feuds.\\
144 - You know, ever since you've been back,\\
145 - you've been mean to everyone.\\
146 - I know you think you're better than us.\\
147 - Even if that's true,\\
148 - it doesn't give you the right\\
149 - to be nasty.\\
150 - If you keep this up,\\
151 - you're not going to have any friends.\\
152 - You think you know what everybody's problem is?\\
153 - Well, guess what, you don't.\\
154 - You think you're so smart and together\\
155 - and that no one notices what an unhappy little person\\
156 - you are.\\
157 - I'm sorry.\\
158 - I'm not going to stroke\\
159 - your fragile ego by confiding in you.\\
160 - Oh, yeah?\\
161 - Well, you're on fire.\\
162 - Mommy.\\
163 - How could you do that to me?\\
164 - You were on fire. I was just trying to help.\\
165 - How does yelling, "Oh, my God,\\
166 - where did those come from?" help?\\
167 - I'm sorry.\\
168 - It just...\\
169 - you scared me.\\
170 - They scared me.\\
171 - I mean, they don't scare me.\\
172 - They startled me. I...\\
173 - I hate this.\\
174 - Everyone looks at me like you did.\\
175 - Like I'm some kind of freak.\\
176 - I was surprised, that's all.\\
177 - It's just really different.\\
178 - I mean, I would react the same way\\
179 - if you had a new haircut.\\
180 - A giant haircut.\\
181 - No one can know about this.\\
182 - You can't tell anyone!\\
183 - What are you talking about?\\
184 - Promise me. But...\\
185 - Promise.\\
186 - All right. All right.\\
187 - I promise.\\
188 - Come on. You're fine.\\
189 - This is just a change on the outside.\\
190 - I mean, inside you're the same.\\
191 - If you give people a chance, they'll see that.\\
192 - Will you stop staring at them?\\
193 - Am... am I staring?\\
194 - Dad, I've been thinking\\
195 - about how to fix your kite problem.\\
196 - I don't have a kite problem.\\
197 - It's okay, Dad.\\
198 - Maybe we could start\\
199 - with you explaining why you hate kites.\\
200 - Let me try it. I want to try.\\
201 - Fine. Here, jerk.\\
202 - Help me! Help!\\
203 - I just do! There doesn't need to be a reason.\\
204 - Doesn't Dewey ever have any homework?\\
205 - He seems to have\\
206 - an awful lot of time on his hands.\\
207 - Something wrong? Yesterday I had\\
208 - the most interesting conversation with Karen.\\
209 - She's in this program\\
210 - where you have to apologize to your loved ones,\\
211 - and it got me thinking...\\
212 - do I have anything that I need to apologize for?\\
213 - Okay, by you, you mean me.\\
214 - And since you're phrasing it as a question,\\
215 - it means you already know the answer.\\
216 - Karen told me that you French-kissed her\\
217 - on New Year's Eve.\\
218 - What? I did not.\\
219 - I can't believe it.\\
220 - You-You're actually accusing me of this?\\
221 - Why would Karen lie?\\
222 - Why would  I  lie?\\
223 - Lois, for the past 20 years\\
224 - yours has been the only tongue\\
225 - that's been in my mouth.\\
226 - Now, you're just going to have to believe that.\\
227 - I don't lie.\\
228 - So, are we going to fly kites tomorrow?\\
229 - Sorry, son, I have to testify at a murder trial.\\
230 - But darn it, you're my son\\
231 - and I want to go to the park with you.\\
232 - Thanks, Dad.\\
233 - The kids don't count.\\
234 - Hal, it wouldn't be such a big deal\\
235 - if you would just admit it.\\
236 - Oh, come on, Lois.\\
237 - What possible reason would I have to kiss Karen?\\
238 - You're a man.\\
239 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
240 - You have been with the same woman all these years.\\
241 - It's only natural to be a little... curious.\\
242 - About what?\\
243 - You mean to tell me,\\
244 - after all these years of marriage,\\
245 - you've never even so much as thought about another woman?\\
246 - What are you talking about?\\
247 - If you are just going to be ridiculous,\\
248 - there is no point in carrying on this conversation.\\
249 - But you are on notice.\\
250 - Wait! I want to talk to you!\\
251 - You are unhappy.\\
252 - Yes, I am.\\
253 - Why?\\
254 - I think I may have ruined my life.\\
255 - I left my family and friends to come up here.\\
256 - I was supposed to be finding myself,\\
257 - but all I feel is empty.\\
258 - I have the answer to your suffering, Francis.\\
259 - The answer is...\\
260 - Francis!\\
261 - Oh.\\
262 - Who was that spiky-head kid\\
263 - that was friends with Little Lulu?\\
264 - What?\\
265 - Ah, don't worry.\\
266 - Maybe it'll come to you if you sleep on it, hmm?\\
267 - Everything's ready.\\
268 - The kite tail is set.\\
269 - It's a windy day.\\
270 - Now, say it.\\
271 - I am not cursed.\\
272 - Good. Now, run\\
273 - and don't stop until it's in the air.\\
274 - I am not cursed. I am not cursed.\\
275 - Come on, get out of the field.\\
276 - Oh, excuse me.\\
277 - Sorry.\\
278 - It's flying! It's flying!\\
279 - I can't believe\\
280 - you guys threw refrigerator magnets at Dabney's back brace.\\
281 - Come on. It was great.\\
282 - He was walking around all day\\
283 - with "Florida is for Lovers" on his back.\\
284 - That laugh is so not cute.\\
285 - I'm sorry my laugh isn't as melodious\\
286 - as your lovely, cracking voice.\\
287 - "My name's Malcolm.\\
288 - I have all the answers, but no one to listen to me."\\
289 - Oh, that's funny.\\
290 - This was fun.\\
291 - Hi, Reese.\\
292 - What a pig.\\
293 - What? What happened to your friend?\\
294 - She was never that great, but now, geez.\\
295 - It's like she's trying to be ugly.\\
296 - Shut up. Someone should tell her\\
297 - she's not in Euro-pee-uh anymore.\\
298 - In America we take showers.\\
299 - Drop it, Reese. She doesn't smell.\\
300 - Well, she dresses like a bag lady.\\
301 - Oh, oh, I know.\\
302 - Her butt is gigantic, and she's trying to hide it.\\
303 - This is so great.\\
304 - I have so much material for that.\\
305 - I have a "wide load" sticker\\
306 - and I can make the truck noise when she backs up.\\
307 - Beep, beep, beep...\\
308 - Reese, when exactly is she going to back up?\\
309 - You're right.\\
310 - Okay, when's her lunch period?\\
311 - I think I'll sneak in and throw bacon at her.\\
312 - Then she'll back up.\\
313 - Beep, beep, beep...\\
314 - Look, moron, she's not hiding her butt.\\
315 - She's hiding her big boobs, okay?\\
316 - So, if you tease her, you're just going to look like a...\\
317 - You are a good, good brother.\\
318 - No.\\
319 - I lied. Her butt is huge.\\
320 - I think it helped Cynthia\\
321 - to tell me what was bothering her.\\
322 - She's been in a much better mood at school.\\
323 - She even stuck her homework up on Dabney's back.\\
324 - What are you doing?! Algebra.\\
325 - What did he say to you?\\
326 - Malcolm, calm down.\\
327 - I'm just helping him with his homework.\\
328 - You know Reese doesn't care about school.\\
329 - That's what  I  thought,\\
330 - but when he asked me for help,\\
331 - he sounded so pathetic, I couldn't say no.\\
332 - How are you doing on number five?\\
333 - Awful. I'm never going to get this.\\
334 - I'm such an idiot.\\
335 - No, you're not.\\
336 - Everyone says I'm an idiot all the time.\\
337 - Well, he is.\\
338 - Malcolm!\\
339 - It's not his fault.\\
340 - Someone at some point decided I was dumb,\\
341 - and that's all anyone ever sees of me.\\
342 - Why do they always focus on one detail?\\
343 - They can never look at the whole person.\\
344 - I don't know.\\
345 - Francis, man, Lavernia's going to kill you\\
346 - if you miss another shift.\\
347 - Let her. I'm not walking away from this totem pole right now.\\
348 - Not when I'm this close to figuring out\\
349 - what it is it's trying to tell me.\\
350 - Have you even eaten anything?\\
351 - No. I'm fasting.\\
352 - It helps my meditation.\\
353 - I can't explain it, but there's some kind\\
354 - of an energy running through this thing.\\
355 - It gave me that dream.\\
356 - It's trying to help me get to something.\\
357 - That's it. We're getting rid of this thing,\\
358 - and we're putting you back on corn dogs and porn\\
359 - for your own safety.\\
360 - Back away from the pole.\\
361 - So... you guys want to go...\\
362 - shoot some eagles?\\
363 - Nothing else to do.\\
364 - What are you going\\
365 - to do to her?\\
366 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
367 - Okay, I've been dying to tell someone.\\
368 - Malcolm, I'm going to see them.\\
369 - What? I'm going to be nice to her,\\
370 - make her my girlfriend, and get her to take her top off.\\
371 - You're crazy.\\
372 - That's what I thought at first,\\
373 - but I've got it all figured out.\\
374 - I've been working on this for days.\\
375 - Tomorrow I'll reveal an embarrassing secret\\
376 - that makes her feel trusted.\\
377 - Friday I'll sneak a kiss and then apologize.\\
378 - Three days later I actually ask her out,\\
379 - she catches me crying, make-out session,\\
380 - she discovers a love letter in my back pocket,\\
381 - heavier make-out session, all culminating in March 8:\\
382 - Double-D Day.\\
383 - You're pure evil!\\
384 - Who's more evil?\\
385 - Me or the person who told me?\\
386 - You! Yeah, but you'd still be in trouble.\\
387 - I bet she'd never forgive you.\\
388 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
389 - I have to go make a mix tape.\\
390 - Okay, so we had a little setback,\\
391 - but don't give up.\\
392 - Oh, forget it!\\
393 - I'm sick of this!\\
394 - I hate kites!\\
395 - I have always hated kites!\\
396 - Dad, don't freak out in front of the other kids.\\
397 - No! I'm never going to get this\\
398 - and I don't want to!\\
399 - You can't just give up.\\
400 - I can give up whenever I want to, and I give up!\\
401 - That's it!\\
402 - I'm tired of your attitude.\\
403 - I'm going home.\\
404 - Dewey! Dewey, come back here.\\
405 - It's too far for you to walk.\\
406 - Oh!\\
407 - Dewey!\\
408 - Dewey, stop!\\
409 - Dewey!\\
410 - Don't you ever run away like that again!\\
411 - There's something on the back of your pants.\\
412 - I'm flying a kite!\\
413 - I'm flying a kite!\\
414 - Lois, I did it!\\
415 - I did it!\\
416 - I actually flew a kite!\\
417 - I can't believe I actually thought these were evil.\\
418 - I love this kite.\\
419 - Why don't you kiss it?\\
420 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
421 - Are you still obsessing about that?\\
422 - I want a straight answer out of you.\\
423 - Lois, I swear,\\
424 - from the moment I laid eyes on you,\\
425 - you were the only woman in the world for me.\\
426 - So you mean to tell me\\
427 - that unlike any other man alive,\\
428 - you don't even have a glancing interest\\
429 - for other women?\\
430 - You and you alone stand outside the dictates\\
431 - of millions of years of evolution?\\
432 - Why is that so hard for you to believe?\\
433 - Because I look at other men!\\
434 - Not seriously\\
435 - and I would never do anything about it,\\
436 - but, God, Hal, I notice.\\
437 - And if you don't, it means that...\\
438 - ...it means that you love me\\
439 - more than I love you.\\
440 - Well, honey, that's always been true.\\
441 - Of course I love you more.\\
442 - And you're okay with that?\\
443 - Oh, yeah.\\
444 - I mean, think about it.\\
445 - If you loved me as much as I loved you,\\
446 - we'd never leave the bedroom.\\
447 - Nothing would get done.\\
448 - We'd die of starvation.\\
449 - I love you!\\
450 - Oh...\\
451 - Not as much as I love you.\\
452 - I have fasted, I have meditated,\\
453 - I got frostbite spending a night in the wilderness.\\
454 - I just want to know what to do.\\
455 - What am I missing?\\
456 - Okay, let's see, there's a wolf.\\
457 - What's that?\\
458 - Loyalty.\\
459 - And the eagle.\\
460 - Keen insight. Insight.\\
461 - And the frog is...\\
462 - bug-eating.\\
463 - But what does it have to do with anything?!\\
464 - Please, just give me a sign or-or a signal or-or something!\\
465 - Oh, my God!\\
466 - You the dirtbag that took my pole? Huh?\\
467 - That's my pole.\\
468 - I want it back.\\
469 - Oh, of course.\\
470 - I'm so sorry.\\
471 - Look, I didn't take it, but, please, I'm going crazy.\\
472 - Can you tell me what it means?\\
473 - Well, if I hit it,\\
474 - it means I'm five inches away from the back of my carport.\\
475 - What?! You use this as a wheel stop?\\
476 - This beautiful, sacred thing?\\
477 - Sacred? It's a decoration.\\
478 - You know, like a coat of arms or a storybook.\\
479 - It's a pretty chunk of wood that my kids helped me carve\\
480 - on a nice Saturday afternoon.\\
481 - But you can't tell me that you can't feel the energy...!\\
482 - You white boys are all the same.\\
483 - I've got dark skin, so I must dance with the bears\\
484 - and listen to the spirit of the wind.\\
485 - I've got news for you.\\
486 - I work for a living.\\
487 - I'm a Baptist, and I'm proud of it.\\
488 - But...\\
489 - are you sure?\\
490 - And by the way, I have only one word for snow:\\
491 - snow.\\
492 - No!\\
493 - Stop!\\
494 - Malcolm...\\
495 - Don't do this. He's not who you think he is.\\
496 - I didn't want to tell you,\\
497 - but the only reason\\
498 - Reese has shown any interest in you\\
499 - is because I told him you have big breasts.\\
500 - What? It just happened.\\
501 - I'm really sorry.\\
502 - But he only wants you for your boobs.\\
503 - Stop saying that!\\
504 - He planned all this.\\
505 - I can prove it.\\
506 - He wrote it all down.\\
507 - This isn't it.\\
508 - Where's your real calendar?\\
509 - That  is  my calendar.\\
510 - All the proceeds went to an animal shelter.\\
511 - He's just using you.\\
512 - And what's worse is you're falling for it.\\
513 - Leave me alone!\\
514 - You heard her!\\
515 - But...\\
516 - What's her name?\\
517 - What?\\
518 - What's... her... name?\\
519 - I know what her name is.\\
520 - And I am not going to dignify that with a response.\\
521 - I know what her name is, and her name... is...\\
522 - Uh...\\
523 - How can you be so creepy?!\\
524 - Don't you even have\\
525 - the remotest sense of decency\\
526 - towards a fellow human being?\\
527 - I have feelings!\\
528 - I will be treated with respect!\\
529 - I will not be objectified!\\
530 - I will not be humiliated or demeaned!\\
531 - Now kiss my shoe!\\
532 - Kiss... my... shoe!\\
533 - The private says,\\
534 - "But, General, I didn't touch your toast!"\\
535 - So, Cynthia,\\
536 - something's different about you.\\
537 - Did you get\\
538 - a haircut?\\
539 - Oh, very stylish.\\
540 - Cynthia,\\
541 - did you like Europe?\\
542 - I did.\\
543 - I forget sometimes\\
544 - that there's a whole world out there\\
545 - that's not full of prurient, adolescent boys.\\
546 - There's sophisticated people\\
547 - who treat me nicely and keep their mouths shut.\\
548 - I get it. Oh...\\
549 - Yes?\\
550 - Is-Is Lois here?\\
551 - Honey? Oh, my God.\\
552 - Are you Lois' husband?\\
553 - Uh-huh.\\
554 - So, who is married to the bald guy\\
555 - with the earring?\\
556 - That's Donna.\\
557 - Darn it! I thought that was one house I didn't have to go to.\\
558 - Excuse me.\\
559 - Oh, yeah, and by the way,\\
560 - I lived in your house\\
561 - while you were on vacation last month.\\
562 - We didn't go on vacation. Darn it!
\subsection {Episode 15: Hal's Birthday}
1 - Fine, I'll go to parent-teacher night.\\
2 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
3 -     I don't know    \\
4 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
5 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     And you're not so big    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     Life is unfair.    \\
14 - Hello.\\
15 - Hey, Stevie.\\
16 - The usual. We're on punishment.\\
17 - No good reason.\\
18 - We had the eggs, we had the golf clubs.\\
19 - What'd she expect?\\
20 - Whoa! Really?\\
21 - I want that thing spotless.\\
22 - I want to be able to lick the bricks.\\
23 - When are you going to lick the bricks?\\
24 - I want you to be able to lick the bricks.\\
25 - I'll lick the bricks right now.\\
26 - This is the last day of your punishment.\\
27 - Do you want me to tack on one day more?\\
28 - All right. All right.\\
29 - Hey, Stevie's dad got three extra tickets\\
30 - to the demolition derby.\\
31 - Cool. That's not even the best part.\\
32 - We're going with Stevie\\
33 - so we get the handicapped seats in the front.\\
34 - Hey, Mom,\\
35 - can we go to the demolition derby tomorrow?\\
36 - Demolition derby?\\
37 - What? You want to go tomorrow?\\
38 - Yeah. Why not?\\
39 - Our punishment's over tonight.\\
40 - You think we might have something planned for tomorrow?\\
41 - Yeah, the demolition derby.\\
42 - Or could it be that tomorrow is your father's birthday?!\\
43 - Oh...\\
44 - We talked about this!\\
45 - Well, maybe Dad can come with us.\\
46 - Yeah, we can get him a ticket from a scalper.\\
47 - That could be our present.\\
48 - You're not going anywhere!\\
49 - You're staying at home\\
50 - and we're going to throw your father a birthday party\\
51 - like we talked about.\\
52 - I have something very special planned.\\
53 - Like what?\\
54 - It's none of your business.\\
55 - It's a surprise for your father.\\
56 - Honestly, I can't believe you boys!\\
57 - You have to be forced\\
58 - into celebrating your father's birthday?!\\
59 - You should be ashamed of yourselves!\\
60 - You know what? You don't have to yell at us.\\
61 - We can hear you just fine if you talk in a normal tone of voice.\\
62 - I'm okay with the present system.\\
63 - Get back to work.\\
64 - I'm not okay with the present system.\\
65 - How does she make me say things like that?\\
66 - Oh, my God. What is it?\\
67 - Francis is coming home.\\
68 - Really? You're kidding.\\
69 - No. This is his itinerary.\\
70 - His flight gets in tomorrow.\\
71 - I hope this doesn't ruin Mom's special plan.\\
72 - This  is  Mom's special plan.\\
73 - Why didn't she tell us?\\
74 - Because it's a surprise for Dad.\\
75 - And if we blow her secret, Mom is going to kill us.\\
76 - So we just need to keep our mouths shut\\
77 - and finish our work.\\
78 - Right.\\
79 - Come on, Dewey. You call this clean?\\
80 -     Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you    \\
81 -     Happy birthday, dear Dad, happy birthday to you.    \\
82 - Don't touch that dial.\\
83 - We'll be right back.\\
84 - You've never seen anything like this before.\\
85 - The demolition derby comes to the fairgrounds!\\
86 - Tonight at 8:00 see Dr. Bob Edwards\\
87 - and his '76 Impala station wagon of death, destruction, mayhem.\\
88 - Big cash prizes. Winner takes home $150...\\
89 - minus entry fee.\\
90 - Wagering prohibited on the fairgrounds.\\
91 - Come if you dare.\\
92 - This is so unfair.\\
93 - Dad has tons of birthdays,\\
94 - but there's only one demolition derby.\\
95 - We never get to do anything good.\\
96 - Well, at least Francis will be here.\\
97 - ...'76 Impala station wagon of death!\\
98 - Yeah.\\
99 - Not bad.\\
100 - Still have a little snap in my skin.\\
101 - For the love of God,\\
102 - what did you do to me?\\
103 - What do you mean?\\
104 - All those sit-ups I did,\\
105 - all those miles I ran every morning\\
106 - and this is how you repay me, by looking like hell?\\
107 - You think I look bad?\\
108 - Please. The crow's feet, the turkey neck?\\
109 - Okay. A few years have gone by.\\
110 - There's been a little wear and tear.\\
111 - Wear and tear?\\
112 - You look like a puppet of yourself\\
113 - made out of cottage cheese.\\
114 - What are you talking about? Check out the pant melons.\\
115 - They still do the trick.\\
116 - Well, sure, it's magnificent,\\
117 - but you're not going to be able\\
118 - to coast on that forever.\\
119 - I postdate checks\\
120 - to the power company all the time.\\
121 - Why is that suddenly such a big deal?\\
122 - Look, I'm a little short this month\\
123 - because I spent a lot of money to surprise my husband\\
124 - for his birthday, but next month...\\
125 - No, it was a special circumstance.\\
126 - Look, can I speak with your supervisor?\\
127 - No, don't put me on hol...\\
128 - Damn!\\
129 - Whoops. Let me get those.\\
130 - Oh, there's one.\\
131 - Yes, I'm still holding.\\
132 - Do you have to stay on the phone?\\
133 - Hal, would you please just give me a minute?\\
134 - They're threatening to cut off the power.\\
135 - It's a 24-hour number. You can call 'em back.\\
136 - No, I can't! Yes, you can!\\
137 - You know, there was a time\\
138 - when I didn't have to ask for your attention.\\
139 - What? Yes, I'm still...\\
140 - I thought you were getting the supervisor.\\
141 - A man likes to be noticed\\
142 - when he walks in a room, Lois.\\
143 - Boys, would you leave the room a minute\\
144 - so your father and I can talk?\\
145 - No!\\
146 - Excuse me?\\
147 - I'm not leaving.\\
148 - You guys just chase us out whenever you want\\
149 - without even asking us!\\
150 - I'm getting tired of it!\\
151 - Watching TV is the only thing to do in this house\\
152 - that's actually fun\\
153 - so you're left with two choices:\\
154 - You can either fight somewhere else\\
155 - or get us a TV for our room!\\
156 - There's no reasoning with that woman.\\
157 - I thought you made some good points.\\
158 - It doesn't matter. She doesn't listen anyway.\\
159 - It's like talking to a wall.\\
160 - Hey, that's what we're doing.\\
161 - Just relax. It's only for a couple of hours.\\
162 - When Francis gets home, they'll forget all about it.\\
163 - We can get through this.\\
164 - We've been waiting for 20 minutes, Lois.\\
165 - When can we eat?\\
166 - Hal, we have to wait\\
167 - for the ice cream to loosen up.\\
168 - You know you like it soft.\\
169 - No, I don't. Yes, you do.\\
170 - In fact, so do we. We all do.\\
171 - Since when?\\
172 - Since yesterday.\\
173 - What happened yesterday?\\
174 - Dad, just be patient. This isn't a witch hunt.\\
175 - Just calm down\\
176 - and whatever happens is going to happen.\\
177 - What are you talking about?\\
178 - What I'm trying to say is we're going\\
179 - to get through this together as a family...\\
180 - ...and as individuals\\
181 - in this great country where we live.\\
182 - Thank God!\\
183 - Come on, Hal.\\
184 - What are you doing?\\
185 - Giving you your present.\\
186 - Ta-da!\\
187 - Happy birthday, Dad. Francis!\\
188 - Oh, my God, it's Francis!\\
189 - Oh, look at you! Come here!\\
190 - I can't believe it!\\
191 - How long are you staying?\\
192 - A few days. Are you surprised?\\
193 - Surprised? I'm in shock!\\
194 - Well, you should be.\\
195 - I've been planning this for months.\\
196 - Thank you.\\
197 - Happy birthday, honey.\\
198 - Hold on.\\
199 - I've got another surprise for you.\\
200 - Everybody, this is Piama.\\
201 - She's my wife.\\
202 - We're married.\\
203 - Hi.\\
204 - I was going to tell you over the phone\\
205 - and then I thought why not bring her down here\\
206 - and surprise you in person?\\
207 - What do you mean you're married?\\
208 - Piama and I are husband and wife.\\
209 - We got married last week.\\
210 - Last week?\\
211 - Francis, who is this woman?\\
212 - She's my wife. Her name is Piama.\\
213 - Hello.\\
214 - Well, come on.\\
215 - Isn't anyone going to congratulate us?\\
216 - What?\\
217 - For getting married.\\
218 - That's what families do.\\
219 - I think I'm going to be sick.\\
220 - Well, come on, Mom.\\
221 - You can at least try and be and happy for me.\\
222 - I'm sorry, Francis.\\
223 - This is a hell of a thing to dump in my lap\\
224 - on your father's birthday.\\
225 - Yeah, it's all about you, Mom.\\
226 - Excuse me for thinking that my family\\
227 - would be excited to meet my wife.\\
228 - I can't believe you guys!\\
229 - Come on, Francis, it's not their fault.\\
230 - What did you expect?\\
231 - You could have at least called ahead of time.\\
232 - Boys, go to your room!\\
233 - What? What do you mean? We're on your side.\\
234 - I said go!\\
235 - How long have you known each other?\\
236 - You never mentioned her.\\
237 - I only met her a month ago... today.\\
238 - Happy anniversary.\\
239 - Plus we had the whole bus ride down.\\
240 - A month? I misjudged you.\\
241 - You know, come to think of it, that's the longest\\
242 - you ever stuck with anything in your life.\\
243 - Congratulations.\\
244 - You outlasted his paper route.\\
245 - Lady, you don't want to stick your hand in my face.\\
246 - Hey, everybody, let's just calm down.\\
247 - We are calm! It's Mom who's flipping out!\\
248 - Oh, Francis, I haven't even started to flip out!\\
249 - Why can't you just be happy for us?!\\
250 - We're supposed to be happy\\
251 - when you repay us like this\\
252 - after all we've done for you?!\\
253 - I'm confused! Are we talking about\\
254 - the years of psychological abuse\\
255 - or shipping me off to military school?!\\
256 - This family sucks. They don't care anything about us.\\
257 - They don't even listen to us.\\
258 - Let's get out of here.\\
259 - To the demolition derby?\\
260 - No. I mean, let's really get out of here\\
261 - and get away from these people.\\
262 - Where are we going to go?\\
263 - Wherever this takes us.\\
264 - I snagged it out of dad's wallet this morning.\\
265 - You knew we were going to need it tonight?\\
266 - Uh, yeah.\\
267 - I'm in. Yeah, but...\\
268 - ...and stomp it into a bloody pulp and throw it in the trash.\\
269 - Why do I even try?\\
270 - You've been nothing but a problem\\
271 - since the day you were born. Let's go.\\
272 - He's trying to explain it to you\\
273 - if you'd just listen to him for once!\\
274 - Why are you talking?! Why are you talking?!\\
275 - Can we just stop this?!\\
276 - Let's get in the car and go for a drive to cool off.\\
277 - We can still have a nice birthday party.\\
278 - Oh, we are long past having a nice birthday party!\\
279 - As usual, Francis has taken something\\
280 - that should have been sweet and ruined it!\\
281 - Don't pin this on me!\\
282 - I am completely willing to have a party right now!\\
283 - Oh, you want to have a party? Happy damn birthday!\\
284 - Hey, why don't we all have some cake?!\\
285 - We don't want to be a part of this family anymore\\
286 - so we're leaving.\\
287 - Oh, great, Mom! Here we go with the dramatics!\\
288 - Who else wants cake?!\\
289 - Thank you. You're welcome.\\
290 - Who wants some delicious damn cake?!\\
291 - Can Piama have a rose?\\
292 - Why not? There's plenty to go around!\\
293 - I'm the one who broke the ice-maker last year!\\
294 - Why do you have to ruin everything?!\\
295 - Well, I learned from the best, Mom!\\
296 - Wow, I've never been in a hotel this fancy before.\\
297 - This isn't a hotel, Dewey.\\
298 - It's our new home.\\
299 - Okay, let me do all the talking.\\
300 - May I help you?\\
301 - My dad called in a reservation.\\
302 - Okay...\\
303 - There you are.\\
304 - As soon as your dad signs this,\\
305 - you're all set.\\
306 - Oh, he's out at the car,\\
307 - but we can take care of it.\\
308 - Maybe you want to have a seat\\
309 - and we'll just wait for your dad.\\
310 - Is there any way we could speed this along?\\
311 - My little brother isn't feeling very well.\\
312 - Yeah, my dad's going to be a while out there.\\
313 - He's cleaning the car where Dewey got sick.\\
314 - I'm sorry, but an adult needs to sign for the room.\\
315 - Look, he's really sick.\\
316 - He could blow any second.\\
317 - He doesn't look that sick to me.\\
318 - Dewey, that was amazing.\\
319 - They ran out of barf dust.\\
320 - I'm hungry.\\
321 - I bet you are.\\
322 - How do you guys want your steaks?\\
323 - Should we look in the park?\\
324 - No, nobody goes there anymore since they put the lights in.\\
325 - Oh.\\
326 - Why didn't you tell us you were getting married?\\
327 - I don't know, Dad.\\
328 - It just happened kind of fast.\\
329 - How can you know anyone in a month?\\
330 - Dad, I knew in a minute.\\
331 - Trust me, Piama is the one.\\
332 - She's a little fiery\\
333 - but she's also kind and funny and completely real.\\
334 - You just haven't gotten to know the real Piama.\\
335 - And whose fault is that?\\
336 - I know, I know, but that's why I brought her down with me\\
337 - so everyone would get to know her.\\
338 - It wasn't supposed to turn into the apocalypse.\\
339 - And what about you and Mom?\\
340 - You got married pretty quick.\\
341 - Yes, but I was a few years older.\\
342 - I had already been with a lot of...\\
343 - I had lived a full life.\\
344 - So you were older.\\
345 - I just happened to run into the exact right person for me\\
346 - a little earlier than you did.\\
347 - Once you meet that person, why wait?\\
348 - Huh? Why not do it if I'm sure?\\
349 - Should I not do it because my family's not sure?\\
350 - It wouldn't matter if the wedding was last week\\
351 - or next week or ten years from now,\\
352 - you and Mom still would have had a problem with it.\\
353 - All my life...\\
354 - I would have come, Francis. What?\\
355 - If you had invited me, I would have come.\\
356 - No, you...\\
357 - I'm sorry.\\
358 - Didn't I tell you flowers were a great idea?\\
359 - Okay, we're all set.\\
360 - You have the Plaza Burger, the Maine lobster,\\
361 - medium-rare Porterhouse, large platter of french fries\\
362 - and a complete dessert cart.\\
363 - Your parents certainly have interesting taste in food.\\
364 - Yeah, they do.\\
365 - Actually, I'm going to need\\
366 - one of your parents to sign that.\\
367 - I left the tip blank.\\
368 - Why don't you put in whatever you think is fair.\\
369 - Bon app  tit.\\
370 - Dewey, your dinner's here!\\
371 - Here you go, Reese.\\
372 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
373 - So this is what a $24 hamburger looks like.\\
374 - I thought it would be as big as my head.\\
375 - Ah. Why don't we have a Jacuzzi tub at home?\\
376 - Because that would make us happy.\\
377 - You know what, forget about that place.\\
378 - Tonight, this is our home.\\
379 - You got a lobster? Yes.\\
380 - I think I deserve a lobster.\\
381 - We all deserve something nice for once.\\
382 - Whoa, this dinner was expensive.\\
383 - I wonder what Dad's credit limit is.\\
384 - Let's find out.\\
385 - They should be home with the boys soon.\\
386 - How's your tea?\\
387 - Fine, thank you.\\
388 - Sugar?\\
389 - No, thanks.\\
390 - That's a pretty bracelet.\\
391 - Thank you.\\
392 - What kind of stone is that?\\
393 - Turquoise.\\
394 - Francis got it for me.\\
395 - Oh.\\
396 - How was your flight?\\
397 - We took the bus.\\
398 - That's right, I guess that's what Francis did\\
399 - with the money that I sent him for his plane fare.\\
400 - Plus the bracelet.\\
401 - Let's talk about something else.\\
402 - You know, Francis isn't the screw-up you think he is.\\
403 - Really?\\
404 - Did you know he works 16 hours a day at his job\\
405 - and he still managed to build\\
406 - a wheelchair ramp for my uncle Jake.\\
407 - In fact... I don't think\\
408 - we should talk about Francis, either.\\
409 - Why not?\\
410 - He's my husband and your son.\\
411 - Needless to say, he and I have\\
412 - a very long and complicated history together\\
413 - that I don't feel like explaining to you.\\
414 - Admit it.\\
415 - You don't like me.\\
416 - I don't even know you.\\
417 - Well, what would you like to know?\\
418 - I'm 19.\\
419 - My mom ran off when I was three\\
420 - and my dad kicked me out of the house when I was 14\\
421 - because I threw out his liquor.\\
422 - I've been married once before,\\
423 - no kids, thank God,\\
424 - and last year, I spent three weeks in jail\\
425 - but it wasn't my fault.\\
426 - Will you stop this, please?\\
427 - You just can't stand\\
428 - for someone in your fancy family to marry beneath him.\\
429 - What?\\
430 - Just because I'm not all classy like you.\\
431 - Classy?\\
432 - You think I'm classy?\\
433 - Don't laugh at me.\\
434 - I'm sorry.\\
435 - It's just, this is a first.\\
436 - I hate to break it to you, but I am not classy.\\
437 - Oh, yeah.\\
438 - You know, I guess what you call class\\
439 - I call manners.\\
440 - I came down here hoping to get along with you,\\
441 - but you're not going to let that happen.\\
442 - You might be surprised at what I'd let happen.\\
443 - So, what's going to happen?\\
444 - I don't know.\\
445 - What is going to happen?\\
446 - Good news.\\
447 - The boys stole my credit card.\\
448 - All we have to do is call the credit card company and...\\
449 - You want to come outside, baby, Honey, why don't we go...\\
450 - and I'll show you my tree house?\\
451 - About time.\\
452 - We called for chocolate syrup, like, 30 minutes ago.\\
453 - Hello, Malcolm.\\
454 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\\
455 - Beat it, Vicky.\\
456 - We'll finish the cuffs later.\\
457 - Okay, boys, get your things.\\
458 - We're going home.\\
459 - No, we're not going back there.\\
460 - Well, you can't stay in this hotel room forever.\\
461 - What are you going to do--\\
462 - live under a bridge and steal food out of Dumpsters?\\
463 - I don't know, but we're not going home.\\
464 - We've had it with the way you treat us\\
465 - and we've had it\\
466 - with all the yelling!\\
467 - You are a terrible influence on us!\\
468 - All you ever do is scream!\\
469 - And order us around!\\
470 - There's something wrong with this family!\\
471 - Families should have\\
472 - some way of communicating besides yelling!\\
473 - Okay, everybody, calm down.\\
474 - I understand what you're saying.\\
475 - I am not going to yell.\\
476 - I am not going to scream.\\
477 - We are capable of talking about this\\
478 - without raising our voices.\\
479 - Now, boys, I want you to understand\\
480 - I am sorry about what happened,\\
481 - but you have to understand I get a little emotional\\
482 - when I learned that my oldest son\\
483 - was acting like an idiot\\
484 - and throwing his life away.\\
485 - Now, that doesn't mean...\\
486 - Stop talking about him like that!\\
487 - Francis is my heart!\\
488 - Okay, we're even.\\
489 - Everyone's fine and there's no need for escalation.\\
490 - Isn't it beautiful when things work out?\\
491 - Yeah, I'd say this has gone pretty well.\\
492 - I mean, considering we got off to a rocky start,\\
493 - we couldn't have asked for a better ending.\\
494 - Get your wife out of my sight.\\
495 - She called you my wife.\\
496 - That's progress.\\
497 - So Dad's birthday wasn't that bad after all.\\
498 - He got a new back shaver.\\
499 - We got to eat cake that was cut by a knife\\
500 - and Mom has promised not to yell at us anymore.\\
501 - Bye, Francis. Bye, Malcolm.\\
502 - Happy birthday, Dad.\\
503 - Thanks, son.\\
504 - Piama.\\
505 - Lois.\\
506 - Anytime you want to finish our little talk.\\
507 - I'd like that.\\
508 - Maybe I'll come for a visit.\\
509 - Maybe I'll come back down here.\\
510 - Anytime, anyplace.\\
511 - Okay, bye. Uh, yeah, yeah, bye.\\
512 - Get back here, you little weasel!\\
513 - Reese!\\
514 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\\
515 - It's all my fault.\\
516 - I'll clean my room and do all my homework.\\
517 - We may want to go back to the old system.
\subsection {Episode 16: Hal Coaches}
1 - I can't believe you, Dewey! How could you do this?!\\
2 - When is she going to stop?\\
3 - I'm starving. Go get us some food.\\
4 - I'm not going out there.\\
5 - That's right, you better cry!\\
6 - Sorry doesn't cut it, young man!\\
7 - This was a good idea.\\
8 - Just wish you had told me earlier.\\
9 - I was hiding outside for 45 minutes\\
10 - before I came in.\\
11 - I saw you.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Boys, you know how you've been hounding us for years\\
25 - for your own computer?\\
26 - Well, your mother and I have arranged a deal\\
27 - with our nice neighbor Ed to get you one.\\
28 - I'm giving you my old laptop.\\
29 - Is it inside that?\\
30 - Nope, that's it. And in exchange,\\
31 - you're going to help Ed set up his new computer.\\
32 - It shouldn't be hard for a smart kid like you.\\
33 - All you have to do is install the sound and graphics card\\
34 - and set up a wireless network for my broadband connection,\\
35 - and I'm good to go.\\
36 - And, Reese, you're going to help him\\
37 - resod his lawn and build a gazebo.\\
38 - What?! No!\\
39 - Come on, boys.\\
40 - Nothing in this life comes free.\\
41 - Oh, Hal, here are those Foreigner albums.\\
42 - Pleasure doing business with you.\\
43 - Oh, just be glad you're getting a computer.\\
44 - Maybe I should get a dog or a rat.\\
45 - Some dumb animal that at least knows how to work for a living!\\
46 - Yes, ma'am.\\
47 - Damn idiots never learned how to do one damn thing right\\
48 - your entire lives!\\
49 - Yes, ma'am.\\
50 - And the blood from my knees\\
51 - was tracking behind where I had already scrubbed\\
52 - so I had to keep going around and around\\
53 - until finally she let me put dish towels\\
54 - on my knees.\\
55 - So, how was your day?\\
56 - Did you make a lot of snow globes?\\
57 - I don't care about that.\\
58 - My husband is being disrespected by a woman who isn't fit\\
59 - to eat the crap between your toes.\\
60 - Someone ought to cut that woman's belly open\\
61 - with a rusty knife and strangle her with her own entrails.\\
62 - I love you, too.\\
63 - If you want me, I'll be under my bed.\\
64 - Oh, come on, Dewey, it wasn't that bad.\\
65 - It was terrible!\\
66 - I hate soccer.\\
67 - I stink!\\
68 - My team stinks.\\
69 - Well, 27-0 doesn't reflect how close\\
70 - the first five minutes of the game were.\\
71 - Hey, you guys won the coin toss.\\
72 - I want to quit. Well, you can't quit.\\
73 - People don't just quit because they lose a couple games.\\
74 - The coach quit.\\
75 - No, he had an emotional breakdown.\\
76 - That's not the same thing.\\
77 - The point is, you're not quitting.\\
78 - In fact, you know what?\\
79 - I'm going to coach you.\\
80 - What?! Well, sure!\\
81 - This'll be great.\\
82 - It'll give us a chance to hang out,\\
83 - spend a little time together,\\
84 - kick the ball around.\\
85 - And who knows, someday you might just look back\\
86 - and say, "Boy, I sure had some fun with my old man."\\
87 - What do you say?\\
88 - No! Dewey, you are not\\
89 - quitting the team.\\
90 - I am going to coach you\\
91 - and we are going to create treasured father-son memories\\
92 - whether you want to or not.\\
93 - So, what's... on the... hard drive?\\
94 - Nothing. He erased everything.\\
95 - No, he just thinks he did.\\
96 - He may have deleted all the programs,\\
97 - but he didn't format the drive.\\
98 - They never... do.\\
99 - There it is.\\
100 - Let's check out what he's got in here.\\
101 - Let's go through his e-mails.\\
102 - Why? It's Ed.\\
103 - What's he going to...?\\
104 - Oh, my God.\\
105 - "Eddie, last night was amazing.\\
106 - You touched me places my husband never knew existed."\\
107 - "TGoodwin."\\
108 - That's Mrs. Goodwin from down the block.\\
109 - That's horrible.\\
110 - They're both married.\\
111 - And fat.\\
112 - Look at this one.\\
113 - "Edward, just saying your name turns me to jelly."\\
114 - That's... Mrs. Fisher.\\
115 - Mrs. Conlin, Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. Beltz...\\
116 - He's sleeping with half the women in this neighborhood.\\
117 - Here's one from old Mrs. Swanbeck.\\
118 - Open the picture attachment.\\
119 - All right, kids, let's huddle up.\\
120 - Huddle up. Come on.\\
121 - Hello there.\\
122 - My name is Hal.\\
123 - I'm the new coach.\\
124 - Now, I don't claim to know a lot\\
125 - about soccer, but I do know about being a young boy.\\
126 - And growing up can be tough.\\
127 - I know what it's like to be the class spaz...\\
128 - the fat kid...\\
129 - the nose picker.\\
130 - Just wipe it on the grass, son.\\
131 - But together, we are more than that.\\
132 - And today we're going to find out\\
133 - what it's like to be a team!\\
134 - Can we just forfeit and get a burger\\
135 - before the line gets too long?\\
136 - No.\\
137 - What we're going to do is go out on that field\\
138 - and we are going to have some fun.\\
139 - You kids make me sick!\\
140 - If you're not puking from exhaustion,\\
141 - you're not playing hard enough!\\
142 - It's a beautiful day.\\
143 - Let's go out and enjoy the sunshine\\
144 - and play some soccer!\\
145 - You will rip their heads off!\\
146 - Do you hear me?!\\
147 - Now stop crying.\\
148 - Stop crying, you little baby!\\
149 - Hey, fella, why don't you just ease up!\\
150 - Come on, they're just kids.\\
151 - You hear that, men?\\
152 - That's what a loser sounds like.\\
153 - All right, what do you say,\\
154 - we go out and give it our best and have some fun?!\\
155 - It was 48 to nothing before the half.\\
156 - I had to call it.\\
157 - Of course.\\
158 - Two, four, six, eight! Who did we annihilate?!\\
159 - The Tigers! The Tigers!\\
160 - We killed the Tigers!\\
161 - Hey, Stevie.\\
162 - You were supposed... to meet me...\\
163 - at the library.\\
164 - Oh, yeah. Sorry.\\
165 - You know, I actually found something decent\\
166 - on Ed's computer.\\
167 - The Virts?\\
168 - Yeah, you create a virtual family,\\
169 - put them in different situations,\\
170 - and the computer plays out their lives.\\
171 - I'm putting in the characters right now.\\
172 - Is that...\\
173 - your mom?\\
174 - Not yet.\\
175 - Reese.\\
176 - Make sure... you capture...\\
177 - the blackness of his soul.\\
178 - Aggressiveness-- ten.\\
179 - Hygiene-- zero.\\
180 - Okay, now me.\\
181 - Malcolm.\\
182 - Appearance-- nine.\\
183 - No, ten.\\
184 - A ten for intelligence.\\
185 - And social skills... ten.\\
186 - Too bad... it doesn't go... higher.\\
187 - I have social skills, jackass!\\
188 - Okay, it's dinnertime.\\
189 - Where's Malcolm?\\
190 - Looking at himself in the mirror.\\
191 - How you doing?\\
192 - I'm hot and I'm bored.\\
193 - What is this stuff?\\
194 - It smells awful.\\
195 - What are you doing?\\
196 - There's bare patches all over the place.\\
197 - Are you even paying attention to what you're doing?\\
198 - Hey, I get grounded plenty, Ed.\\
199 - I know how to do grunt work.\\
200 - So why don't you just go fix Mrs. Conlin's "garage door"\\
201 - and get off my back!\\
202 - What did you say? You heard me.\\
203 - Oh, my God. What do you know?\\
204 - Everything.\\
205 - You might want to formulate your megabytes\\
206 - next time you get rid of your computer.\\
207 - Oh, and by the way,\\
208 - Mrs. Swanbeck? You are sick.\\
209 - Keep your voice down.\\
210 - Look, it's not my fault.\\
211 - I try to be faithful,\\
212 - but the women on this block are just so desperate\\
213 - and lonely.\\
214 - It's like I cast some kind of spell.\\
215 - I try to tell them no,\\
216 - but it always leads to a back rub.\\
217 - I know, Ed. I read all about it.\\
218 - Is that you, Ed?\\
219 - I'm a little busy right now, Martha.\\
220 - Look...\\
221 - you can't tell my wife.\\
222 - You can't tell anyone.\\
223 - Please.\\
224 - I'll do anything.\\
225 - I'll do anything you ask.\\
226 - I can work with that.\\
227 - Damn these loggers!\\
228 - Don't they know somebody's got to clean up\\
229 - their caribou carcass?\\
230 - These antlers won't fit down the disposal!\\
231 - Oh, hey, Francis, come away from there.\\
232 - You don't have to do that.\\
233 - You're much to valuable an employee to mess with that.\\
234 - But yesterday you said you'd seen tumors with hair\\
235 - that were smarter than me.\\
236 - Can't you tell good-natured ribbing?\\
237 - I got a more important job for you.\\
238 - Why don't you sit in that chair\\
239 - and check out the reception on the TV.\\
240 - It's been kind of spotty lately.\\
241 - Oh, and make sure these sodas haven't gone flat.\\
242 - That sounds... doable.\\
243 - We got other people to do the grunt work.\\
244 - A newlywed like you shouldn't be tiring himself out\\
245 - before he even gets home.\\
246 - Your lovely, young wife wouldn't like that, would she?\\
247 - What did you do?\\
248 - I don't know what you're talking about, honey.\\
249 - Lavernia is being nice to me.\\
250 - She's treating me like a human being!\\
251 - What did you do to her?\\
252 - Maybe she turned over a new leaf.\\
253 - Sometimes really big crappy jerks\\
254 - just realize they got to change their ways.\\
255 - This woman was terrified,\\
256 - and I've never seen her scared of anything.\\
257 - I don't know how you threatened her,\\
258 - but you must have said something.\\
259 - I wouldn't do that, Francis.\\
260 - You're the man.\\
261 - I'm not going to fight your battles for you.\\
262 - Obviously that's not true.\\
263 - Now, damn it, you're going to tell me what you did!\\
264 - You know what?\\
265 - I don't have to do anything you tell me to do.\\
266 - And you might want to reconsider your tone of voice.\\
267 - Sometimes you make me so mad.\\
268 - All right, look, uh, today's practice was...\\
269 - Well, let's-let's focus on the positive.\\
270 - I-I think it's encouraging that so many of you\\
271 - found the right field.\\
272 - And a special congratulations go to Billy\\
273 - for using the sidestep that we practiced\\
274 - to run away from the butterfly that almost landed near him.\\
275 - But we do need to work on\\
276 - your general unwillingness to kick the ball.\\
277 - It hurts!\\
278 - Boys, if we are going to get better,\\
279 - we're going to have to work together.\\
280 - We're going to have to start acting like a team.\\
281 - You know what it means to be on a team, don't you?\\
282 - Well, don't look at...\\
283 - Come on, think of a team.\\
284 - Like the X-Men?\\
285 - Yes!\\
286 - Yes! Yes, like the X-Men.\\
287 - You boys are like the X-Men.\\
288 - And what do the X-Men do?\\
289 - Fight evil?\\
290 - Yes, they work together.\\
291 - To fight evil and also to uphold the ideals\\
292 - of good sportsmanship and teamwork!\\
293 - And fight evil!\\
294 - Yes! Okay, okay, boys.\\
295 - Come on, come on, come on, huddle up, huddle up.\\
296 - I should not be telling you this,\\
297 - but the American Youth Soccer Federation\\
298 - has been infiltrated by evil forces\\
299 - hell-bent on total domination of the Earth.\\
300 - Now, the infiltration goes all the way down\\
301 - to the lowest levels.\\
302 - I'm talking the Blackhawks, the Bulldogs, the Eagles.\\
303 - Every other team in our league\\
304 - has been lost to the forces of evil.\\
305 - And it's up to you boys to stop them.\\
306 - Now, boys, what do you say, hmm?\\
307 - Who wants to be on the side of goodness and virtue\\
308 - and who wants to rid the world of evil?!\\
309 - All right, boys!\\
310 - Now, let's get out there and do some kicking drills!\\
311 - Can you please... start working?\\
312 - Just one more second.\\
313 - This is really interesting.\\
314 - I just made my mom quit her crappy job\\
315 - and go to law school.\\
316 - It's less money, but her happiness level went way up.\\
317 - I made my dad quit, too.\\
318 - All he's doing is working on neighbors' cars,\\
319 - but check out his happiness level.\\
320 - But I still think they could be happier.\\
321 - Let's send Reese to China.\\
322 - What are you changing... about Malcolm?\\
323 - Nothing, he's fine.\\
324 - He's burning himself...\\
325 - with a cigarette.\\
326 - Just a phase.\\
327 - Where were you?\\
328 - I've been waiting ten minutes for that lotion.\\
329 - Look at this. I am starting to freckle.\\
330 - Look, Reese, my wife gets back soon.\\
331 - I'm going to have a hard time\\
332 - explaining why I'm catering to a 15-year-old boy.\\
333 - I'll explain it to her if you want me to.\\
334 - That's okay, forget I mentioned it.\\
335 - Fly. Where?\\
336 - Just a drill.\\
337 - Well, the oak seems to burn\\
338 - a few degrees hotter than the maple.\\
339 - This game is asinine!\\
340 - I thought you liked it.\\
341 - No, this is idiotic programming.\\
342 - My family has turned out horrible.\\
343 - My mom finished law school\\
344 - and became a Supreme Court justice,\\
345 - Reese is the king of China,\\
346 - and my dad is a millionaire\\
347 - from his chain of auto body shops.\\
348 - Why is Malcolm sneaking scotch\\
349 - from the toilet tank?\\
350 - He won't stop drinking!\\
351 - That's his second bottle since breakfast.\\
352 - I am so done with this game.\\
353 - No, you know what?\\
354 - I'm moving them all to Arkansas to become chicken farmers.\\
355 - That ought to level out the playing field.\\
356 - Hi, honey. This is great!\\
357 - You're home early.\\
358 - And you don't come home so mad anymore.\\
359 - I think we may have to split up.\\
360 - What?!\\
361 - I'm not sure this marriage is working.\\
362 - I mean, I love you, but I don't know you that well.\\
363 - Hell, I can't even pronounce your last name.\\
364 - Tan-nah-nah-ha-ahk-nah.\\
365 - And then with this whole Lavernia thing,\\
366 - I'm starting to think there's a side...\\
367 - I don't understand.\\
368 - If someone does something because they love someone\\
369 - and it solves the problem, then...\\
370 - No!\\
371 - Marriage is supposed to be\\
372 - about trust and communication and not being terrified!\\
373 - We're supposed to be a team, I thought.\\
374 - Look, I'm going to ask you one last time,\\
375 - for the sake of our marriage, what did you do?\\
376 - Took her parakeet.\\
377 - What? I took her parakeet!\\
378 - You stole the woman's pet?\\
379 - The woman's pet?!\\
380 - You protect the people that you love.\\
381 - I figured you'd do the same for me.\\
382 - But I would tell you!\\
383 - If I was going to grab someone's parakeet\\
384 - and hold it hostage...\\
385 - Well, gee, I wouldn't do that!\\
386 - How long were you going to keep it for, anyway?\\
387 - Till she behaved.\\
388 - And if she didn't, I guess I'd have killed it.\\
389 - See, that's where it gets alarming again.\\
390 - But putting aside\\
391 - the horrible nature of the act itself,\\
392 - what's really upsetting is that you made\\
393 - this unilateral decision.\\
394 - I said I was sorry!\\
395 - How many times do you want me to say it?!\\
396 - You didn't say you were...\\
397 - And what about you?\\
398 - You were going to break up with me!\\
399 - You think that makes me feel safe?\\
400 - You're right.\\
401 - I'm sorry.\\
402 - Wait! No!\\
403 - I'm not apologizing here.\\
404 - We need to bring this bird back,\\
405 - and if I do it, she's going to think I was involved.\\
406 - You made this mess without me.\\
407 - You clean it up without me!\\
408 - Or what?\\
409 - Or maybe I'll do it for you!\\
410 - And you...\\
411 - have dinner ready when I get back!\\
412 - Look, Ed, school gets out at 3:00.\\
413 - It is 2:15.\\
414 - I've been waiting around for over an hour!\\
415 - Sorry, Reese.\\
416 - Excuse me.\\
417 - Damn, hurry up. Get in the car.\\
418 - Hello, I'm Mrs. Abbott, Reese's guidance counselor.\\
419 - I've been trying to talk to you about your son\\
420 - for the past three weeks.\\
421 - Well, I'm here now. What can I do for you?\\
422 - You have to stop this.\\
423 - Stupid game!\\
424 - This is ridiculous!\\
425 - Everybody in my family is, like, perfect.\\
426 - My mom is president,\\
427 - Reese is married to six supermodels,\\
428 - and my dad used all his money\\
429 - to fund a search for extraterrestrials.\\
430 - Nothing I do has any effect whatsoever.\\
431 - If I give them money, if I take it away,\\
432 - if I make them ugly, if I make them Canadian,\\
433 - everything works out beautifully for them\\
434 - and horrible for me!\\
435 - Dewey just became Pope.\\
436 - And I weigh 500 pounds.\\
437 - That's it.\\
438 - I'm just going to have to kill them.\\
439 - Go to counter, get knife, kill them.\\
440 - No!\\
441 - Don't make yourself a sandwich!\\
442 - Kill! Kill!\\
443 - No, not yourself!\\
444 - Don't kill. Don't kill.\\
445 - You stupid fat bastard!\\
446 - This means nothing!\\
447 - So, Dad, are you going to ground me?\\
448 - Boy, your counselor was furious.\\
449 - So how about we head back to your place,\\
450 - you can set up your Jacuzzi,\\
451 - and then you can throw something on the barbecue for me.\\
452 - I've got a better idea.\\
453 - I'll get in my Jacuzzi, and you'll fix dinner for me.\\
454 - What are you talking about?\\
455 - With the information I just got on you,\\
456 - I can call your mother\\
457 - and you won't see daylight for years.\\
458 - Oh, yeah?\\
459 - One word, and I'm telling your wife your little secret.\\
460 - I guess the question is: am I more scared of my wife\\
461 - or are you more scared of your mother?\\
462 - Then get a dozen peach roses--\\
463 - they got to be peach--\\
464 - and run them over to Mrs. Malone's.\\
465 - Lavernia, I'm sorry.\\
466 - I just talked to my wife, and it turns out\\
467 - this was all a big misunderstanding.\\
468 - She's sorry, too, and we just want you to have...\\
469 - I guess I should have put\\
470 - a blanket on this on the way over.\\
471 - I just want you to know that I...\\
472 - Okay, boys, look, we have come a long way,\\
473 - and today is the day we show what we're made of!\\
474 - Now, who are we?\\
475 - The forces of good!\\
476 - And who's evil?\\
477 - The Gophers!\\
478 - We've got a schedule change, Coach.\\
479 - The Gophers didn't show up,\\
480 - so you're playing the Blackhawks again.\\
481 - Don't worry, I'll call it before it gets too ugly.\\
482 - We're playing the Blackhawks again?\\
483 - Boys, boys, listen to me.\\
484 - You're forgetting your mission.\\
485 - You're here to fight evil,\\
486 - and the Blackhawks are the most evil of all.\\
487 - You know when the teacher remembers to give you homework\\
488 - right before you're leaving school at the end of the day?\\
489 - The Blackhawks are behind it.\\
490 - When your mother says\\
491 - you can't watch TV, for no reason,\\
492 - the Blackhawks told her to say that.\\
493 - And when you didn't get the Christmas presents\\
494 - that you wanted, do you know who got them?\\
495 - The Blackhawks.\\
496 - If it were up to them,\\
497 - we wouldn't even have a Christmas.\\
498 - I for one am glad that we have the chance to fight\\
499 - for what is right and good in this world!\\
500 - Now, I ask you boys, who are we going to beat?!\\
501 - The Blackhawks!\\
502 - And what are they? Evil!\\
503 - Yeah!\\
504 - Teams take the field!\\
505 - I love you boys.\\
506 - I've done all the coaching I can do.\\
507 - The rest is up to them.\\
508 - No...\\
509 -        \\
510 - Eat chalk, evildoer!\\
511 - Oh, my God. No.\\
512 - We couldn't stop them if we wanted to.\\
513 - So you just left the truck there\\
514 - and ran all the way home?\\
515 - Hey, you didn't see the look on her face.\\
516 - I'm kind of scared to even go into work tomorrow.\\
517 - You know, she does have a turtle.
\subsection {Episode 17: Dewey's Dog}
1 - Hey.\\
2 - What are we watching?\\
3 - A documentary on eye surgery.\\
4 - They're reattaching a retina.\\
5 - The procedure involves\\
6 - making small incisions into the wall of the eye\\
7 - to allow the introduction of instruments\\
8 - into the vitreous cavity.\\
9 - Is there anything else on?\\
10 - Dad, this is interesting.\\
11 - I might be a doctor someday.\\
12 - You're right, you're right.\\
13 - The draining of the vitreous, the clear, gel-like fluid\\
14 - that fills the back of the eye...\\
15 - Ah! Uh, I'm going to go read.\\
16 - Kiki beats the heat in a red chiffon teddy.\\
17 - You don't want to watch a lingerie calendar shoot\\
18 - with your dad.\\
19 - And Alexandra likes...\\
20 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
21 -     I don't know    \\
22 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     And you're not so big    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
30 -     And you're not so big    \\
31 -     Life is unfair.    \\
32 - Come on!\\
33 - You boys are late.\\
34 - I want you out of this house in 30 seconds.\\
35 - Let's show some hustle.\\
36 - We've got time.\\
37 - When we're really late, our lunches are on the front lawn.\\
38 - Mom, Reese...\\
39 - Go, go, go, go!\\
40 - Okay, I'm doing dry cleaner, mechanic\\
41 - and post office.\\
42 - You're doing groceries and DMV, right?\\
43 - Right. You got the cable bill?\\
44 - Great. Bye, guy.\\
45 - Did I just say "Bye, guy" to you?\\
46 - I'm pretty sure you did.\\
47 - "Guy?" I-I-I called you "guy"?!\\
48 - How can that happen?\\
49 - I've never done that before.\\
50 - Hal, it's a lapse; it doesn't mean anything.\\
51 - "Guy"?! Hal, it happens.\\
52 - Let's get one thing clear.\\
53 - In no way, shape, or form do I think of you as a guy.\\
54 - You are a gorgeous,\\
55 - exciting, feminine goddess\\
56 - that I still don't know what I've done to deserve.\\
57 - Do you understand that?\\
58 - Yes.\\
59 - Let's do this walking.\\
60 - Okay, just for argument's sake,\\
61 - let's say Dr. Bombay was one of the MASH surgeons.\\
62 - I'd still want Hawkeye operating\\
63 - on my perforated aorta.\\
64 - It's experience that counts.\\
65 - Think about it.\\
66 - Will you hurry up with those dishes?-- my bubbles are evaporating.\\
67 - Eric, you're not going to believe this.\\
68 - I swear I just saw Commandant Spangler\\
69 - standing outside the window.\\
70 - That's not even funny, Francis.\\
71 - There are some things you just don't joke about,\\
72 - and that hook-handed maniac is at the top of the list.\\
73 - But he was so real.\\
74 - It was like being back at military school.\\
75 - I know.\\
76 - For a long time, I saw him every time I shut my eyes.\\
77 - You just have to remember we escaped\\
78 - from that hellhole.\\
79 - We made it out\\
80 - and found better lives for ourselves.\\
81 - Now, let's get\\
82 - these dishes done.\\
83 - We still have to snake out the toilets\\
84 - before we can call it a night.\\
85 - Hey, guys, wait up!\\
86 - Hi.\\
87 - I'm Dewey.\\
88 - You smell terrible.\\
89 - I like you.\\
90 - Maybe you could come home with me.\\
91 - Dewey, you're not allowed to have a dog, remember?\\
92 - We want you to be miserable.\\
93 - That's right, son, it's our job to make sure\\
94 - we're as unfair as possible to you.\\
95 - Don't listen to them, Dewey.\\
96 - I've studied the matter thoroughly,\\
97 - and I'm convinced you can get away with it.\\
98 - All you have to do is hide me. Hmm.\\
99 - I'll call you Marshmallow.\\
100 - ("Tonight's the Night" playing)\\
101 -     Tonight's the night    \\
102 -     It's gonna be all right    \\
103 -     'Cause I love you, girl    \\
104 -     Ain't nobody gonna stop us now...    \\
105 - Hal, what are you doing here?\\
106 - Well, you're off work in five minutes,\\
107 - and I am here to whisk you away for a night of romance.\\
108 - Oh, honey, that's so sweet, but I can't.\\
109 - I've got to cover for Craig tonight.\\
110 - Why?!\\
111 - Oh, he's sick as a dog.\\
112 - Come on! You know that guy's the biggest faker in the world.\\
113 - The last time he was out with the flu,\\
114 - we saw him jumping up and down in the window on The Today Show.\\
115 - That doesn't mean I wasn't sick.\\
116 - You didn't happen to tape that, did you?\\
117 - I set my timer wrong.\\
118 - Oh, honey,\\
119 - I'm so sorry.\\
120 - After all the trouble you went through.\\
121 - No. It's no big deal.\\
122 - Really, it wasn't any trouble.\\
123 - Thanks again for the ride home.\\
124 - Wow.\\
125 - So, this is what it would have been like\\
126 - to go to my prom.\\
127 - All I wanted was a nice evening with my wife.\\
128 - I even dug up\\
129 - the wedding vows\\
130 - I never was able to read to her.\\
131 - What happened?\\
132 - Oh, she went into labor with Francis\\
133 - in the middle of the ceremony.\\
134 - I was going to read them to her tonight.\\
135 - God... now I feel awful.\\
136 - Don't worry about it, Craig.\\
137 - It's not your fault.\\
138 - No, I really feel awful.\\
139 - Shh.\\
140 - Are you awake?\\
141 - Oh, honey, I'm so sorry about tonight.\\
142 - Listen, tomorrow night, I'm going to fix us\\
143 - such a special dinner-- just the two of us.\\
144 - We'll lock the boys in the garage,\\
145 - open a bottle of wine-- it'll be great.\\
146 - Oh, I know, honey, I know.\\
147 - That's all I have.\\
148 - Is the roast medium rare?\\
149 - Did you put the wine in the fridge?\\
150 - Mom, my roast is perfect.\\
151 - I never even knew we had fancy silverware.\\
152 - When was the last time you used this?\\
153 - The night you were conceived.\\
154 - You want more details?\\
155 - No. Good.\\
156 - Thank you so much for your help!\\
157 - Now, get in your room, and don't make a peep\\
158 - for the next five hours.\\
159 - Move!\\
160 - (Marshmallow whining, Dewey grunting)\\
161 - He's not a dog.\\
162 - He's just pretend.\\
163 - What's for dinner?\\
164 - A dog? Busted!\\
165 - Please don't tell Mom! Please!\\
166 - Do you have a death wish?\\
167 - Just let me have him one night.\\
168 - I love him, and he loves me.\\
169 - Please, please!\\
170 - Okay, Dewey, relax.\\
171 - We won't tell.\\
172 - Thank you!\\
173 - So, when do we tell?\\
174 - As soon as Dad gets home.\\
175 - It'll be funnier.\\
176 - I couldn't sleep at all last night.\\
177 - Me, too. It's like there's something creepy in the air.\\
178 - Francis!\\
179 - Commandant Spangler.\\
180 - What are you doing in Alaska?\\
181 - I've come for  you,  Francis!\\
182 - I've been searching for you for months.\\
183 - Me? Why?\\
184 - Why?!\\
185 - Because...\\
186 - after 32 years as an educator and disciplinarian,\\
187 - your  desertion\\
188 - stood out as my\\
189 - only failure--\\
190 - a  failure  that...\\
191 - haunted my every waking moment.\\
192 - I began to see  your face\\
193 - and those of other young cadets who didn't\\
194 - deserve the wrath that I poured down on their innocent souls.\\
195 - There was a lawsuit.\\
196 - Charges were filed.\\
197 - Disgrace.\\
198 - I can't even remember the fire.\\
199 - But I  do  remember the  cause\\
200 - for all of my\\
201 - suffering.\\
202 - I saw the  stupid,  grinning face\\
203 - of the one person responsible for all of my suffering.\\
204 - Who?\\
205 - Die!\\
206 - Die!\\
207 - Die!\\
208 - Die... Sir, cut it out.\\
209 - Your hooks are cold.\\
210 - And then Dewey and Marshmallow\\
211 - killed the evil dragon,\\
212 - rescued the poodle princess\\
213 - and flew all the way back home.\\
214 - And they got medals and big, red capes,\\
215 - and everybody loved them.\\
216 - Are you okay?\\
217 - Marshmallow.\\
218 - Whoa.\\
219 - Marshmallow, stop!\\
220 - Boys, I thought I told you to stay in your room!\\
221 - Marshmallow, hide!\\
222 - I don't understand it!\\
223 - An entire roast\\
224 - with your bare hands?!\\
225 - T-th-the, the salad, the potatoes, t-the green beans?!\\
226 - What do you have to say for yourself?!\\
227 - I was hungry, I guess.\\
228 - This is great.\\
229 - Let's tell them about the dog\\
230 - and really nail his coffin shut.\\
231 - Not yet; I have a hunch.\\
232 - An entire stick of butter?!\\
233 - Now! Let's tell them now!\\
234 - Wait for it, wait for it.\\
235 - Wait a second.\\
236 - How could you eat... a candle?\\
237 - I like candles.\\
238 - I think they're good.\\
239 - That's it!\\
240 - You are going to the hospital and getting your stomach pumped.\\
241 - (phone ringing, indistinct announcement over P.A.)\\
242 - All right, young man.\\
243 - I think you're empty.\\
244 - Well?\\
245 - He's fine.\\
246 - We didn't find any candles,\\
247 - but we did find some marbles\\
248 - and the waistband to a pair of underpants.\\
249 - Don't ask.\\
250 - Thank you, Doctor.\\
251 - All right, Dewey, this is the end.\\
252 - You and your brothers\\
253 - are now officially in the red zone.\\
254 - But... Red zone, mister!\\
255 - Now, tomorrow night\\
256 - I am taking your mother out on an emergency date.\\
257 - It will be a beautiful, romantic, magical evening\\
258 - that we need very badly,\\
259 - and nothing is going to derail it\\
260 - on penalty of death.\\
261 - Good.\\
262 - Do you want your army man?\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - So, how's he doing?\\
265 - I was up with him all night.\\
266 - It got pretty wild\\
267 - but I think he's doing better now.\\
268 - I want to die!\\
269 - Why can't I just die?\\
270 - Stop talking like that, sir.\\
271 - This is just a momentary setback.\\
272 - I have nothing to live for.\\
273 - Mother no longer acknowledges me.\\
274 - I have no friends, no money.\\
275 - I won't even tell you how I paid for my journey up here.\\
276 - If it means anything to you, sir,\\
277 - you taught me how to be a man.\\
278 - I have no idea who you are.\\
279 - You don't remember me?\\
280 - After all that time at Marlin,\\
281 - the hell that you put me through,\\
282 - you don't even remember me?\\
283 - Cadet Dudley?\\
284 - No! Eric!\\
285 - I just spent the last ten hours cradling you!\\
286 - Sir, this is because you're not feeling useful.\\
287 - Look, I've talked to some people\\
288 - and I think I may have found you a job.\\
289 - A what?\\
290 - It'd be with the Interior Department.\\
291 - You'd be helping the environment,\\
292 - working with people--\\
293 - you would be making a real difference.\\
294 - I can do that.\\
295 - Thank you, son.\\
296 - And please, thank that girl\\
297 - for rocking me in her arms all night long.\\
298 - All right, who's ready\\
299 - for a fantastic night on the town?\\
300 - Oh...\\
301 - Hal, they're beautiful.\\
302 - Just give me\\
303 - two minutes to freshen up and I'll be ready to roll.\\
304 - Just stay put, Dewey.\\
305 - You're doing great.\\
306 - We've been in here for three hours.\\
307 - Hey, I'm just looking out for your best interest.\\
308 - Okay, Dad just came home.\\
309 - Let's tell them now so it ruins their date.\\
310 - Or, we can wait till they come home\\
311 - and they might be drunk.\\
312 - This is true.\\
313 - All right, boys--\\
314 - your father and I are leaving now.\\
315 - I left the number for the restaurant on the counter.\\
316 - If we get a call, it better be from the coroner.\\
317 - Nothing is going to ruin this night!\\
318 - M'lady, your carriage awaits.\\
319 - Well, I'm out of here.\\
320 - Back at 10:00?\\
321 - Sounds good.\\
322 - Dewey, you and your dopey dog\\
323 - are on your own for an hour or two.\\
324 - Nope. What are you talking about?\\
325 - Did something happen to the dog?\\
326 - Oh, he's fine. He's just busy destroying\\
327 - your comic book collection.\\
328 - What?\\
329 - That's it.\\
330 - You're getting rid of that thing right now!\\
331 - And you're going to pay for this!\\
332 - I don't think so. Oh, I think so.\\
333 - Sit!\\
334 - I wasn't talking to him.\\
335 - Ever since the day I was born,\\
336 - you guys have been torturing me.\\
337 - I remember you trying to switch me for another baby at the park.\\
338 - I remember you telling me the tooth fairy was a vampire.\\
339 - I remember every\\
340 - wet Willie, every booger sandwich,\\
341 - every stink hat...\\
342 - Dewey, we're sorry.\\
343 - ...every waffle butt, every chester backster\\
344 - and every purple nurple!\\
345 - And now\\
346 - you're going to  pay.\\
347 - Dewey, this isn't going to work.\\
348 - Mom and Dad will be home in a few hours,\\
349 - that dog will be gone, you'll be in trouble,\\
350 - and we'll kick your ass for the next ten years.\\
351 - I know.\\
352 - So we'd better get started.\\
353 - What do you want?\\
354 - Everything.\\
355 - I want everything.\\
356 - Hal, this place is beautiful.\\
357 - It's so romantic.\\
358 - Everything is fabulous.\\
359 - Yes, it is fabulous.\\
360 - Look, they have\\
361 - your favorite-- oysters!\\
362 - We'll have to order some of those.\\
363 - Actually, I had a big batch\\
364 - of oysters for lunch.\\
365 - You did?\\
366 - Where did you get oysters?\\
367 - A guy has a cart outside the building.\\
368 - Besides, I am dying to try this plain broth--\\
369 - they're famous for it.\\
370 - For their broth? What are you talking about?\\
371 - Is that your friend Suzy from work?\\
372 - Who, that fat old man?\\
373 - Never mind. I'm just so excited to be here.\\
374 - Excuse me, sorry.\\
375 - Please,\\
376 - could you turn the air conditioning like\\
377 - 10-15 degrees colder?\\
378 - Okay.\\
379 - Okay...\\
380 - Hal... what are you up to?\\
381 - I'll never tell.\\
382 - I love this.\\
383 - I'm having such a great time.\\
384 - Me, too.\\
385 - Excuse me.\\
386 - Hurry back.\\
387 - Excuse me.\\
388 - I need your help.\\
389 - Here-- here's $20.\\
390 - Go and buy me some medicine-- some cold medicine--\\
391 - and serve it to me in a champagne glass.\\
392 - But I-I... Just stop talking and go!\\
393 - Pencils down.\\
394 - Who wants to read their essay first?\\
395 - Marshmallow, why don't you choose?\\
396 - "50 reasons why Dewey\\
397 - "is the greatest brother\\
398 - "in the history of the universe\\
399 - and I'm a worthless chunk of garbage."\\
400 - Is that what we were supposed to be writing about?\\
401 - From the top.\\
402 - "50 reasons why Dewey is the greatest brother in the...\\
403 - Stop.\\
404 - Something's not right.\\
405 - Wait.\\
406 - There.\\
407 - Continue.\\
408 - Nobody move.\\
409 - Hello?! I know\\
410 - someone's home.\\
411 - I saw shapes moving on the curtain!\\
412 - Marshmallow, guard.\\
413 - Hey, sport, is your dad home?\\
414 - No, they went to a restaurant,\\
415 - but they said you should go over...\\
416 - Well, I just came to drop off some pants.\\
417 - They got out... Craig, help!\\
418 - Help up, please!\\
419 - Dewey's gone crazy.\\
420 - He's holding us prisoner.\\
421 - I'm sorry you had to see this.\\
422 - Number 12...\\
423 - his twinkling eyes.\\
424 - To us.\\
425 - To us.\\
426 - You know, Lois...\\
427 - Don't pass out.\\
428 - No! No, keep it together.\\
429 - Smile, smile! Laugh!\\
430 - You're going to throw up.\\
431 - Okay, if it comes to it, aim for the ice bucket.\\
432 -     We're stinky and evil, we're dumb and sarcastic    \\
433 -     While Dewey, in contrast    \\
434 -     Is super fantastic    \\
435 -     And that's why Dewey is king    \\
436 -     Why Dewey is king.    \\
437 - Hey, it's haircut time.\\
438 - Think of your favorite Stooge, and I'll be right back.\\
439 - Marshmallow, if anyone moves, eat them.\\
440 - This is insane.\\
441 - We've got to do something.\\
442 - I'm Moe.\\
443 - We don't have a choice.\\
444 - I say at the count of three,\\
445 - we split up and all run for different doors.\\
446 - Are you nuts? He might get one of us.\\
447 - Yeah, but two of us\\
448 - will get away and go for help.\\
449 - I'm willing if you are. I can't sing anymore.\\
450 - Ready? On three.\\
451 - One...\\
452 - two...\\
453 - three.\\
454 - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!\\
455 - Go, go, go, go!\\
456 - No. Good dog! No, no!\\
457 - Ah! Ooh! Not the face!\\
458 - Craig's a good guy.\\
459 - He always comes through for us.\\
460 - I couldn't find\\
461 - any rusty scissors, so we're going to have\\
462 - to use...\\
463 - Where is he?\\
464 - He should have been back by now.\\
465 - Look at this, my palms are sweaty.\\
466 - Would you calm down? Here he comes.\\
467 - So?\\
468 - For some reason, I was fired.\\
469 - I don't believe it, he's drunk again.\\
470 - You're just going to have to face it, Francis--\\
471 - there's no hope for this guy.\\
472 - The only thing that ever made him remotely happy\\
473 - was tormenting and bullying helpless students.\\
474 - Without that, he's nothing.\\
475 - You call that a collage?\\
476 - Is it an  insult\\
477 - to the craft.\\
478 - I can see paste coming up over the top of the Popsicle stick.\\
479 - I'm sorry, I have arthritis.\\
480 - That's it.\\
481 - You have just lost pudding\\
482 - for the whole group.\\
483 - Feel free to thank Mrs. Meekitjuk after I leave.\\
484 - I feel like dancing.\\
485 - Me, too.\\
486 - Oh, darling, there's something\\
487 - I've wanted to say to you\\
488 - for the longest time.\\
489 - Uh-huh?\\
490 - I have to go to the hospital.\\
491 - Oh, Hal, you don't know how happy that makes me.\\
492 - What do you think?\\
493 - One more can?\\
494 - No, we don't want to spoil him.\\
495 - Besides, he probably has to go\\
496 - to the bathroom now.\\
497 - Who wants to go out in the front yard?\\
498 - I'll remember  this,  too.\\
499 - "And how can words describe how I feel\\
500 - on this, the day of our marriage?"\\
501 - "You are my day, my night, the sun in my sky.\\
502 - You are the Duran to my Duran."\\
503 - Oh, Hal.\\
504 - "Her name is Lois and she dances on the sand\\
505 - just like that river twisting through a dusty land..."
\subsection {Episode 18: Poker #2}
1 - Good night, honey.\\
2 - Good night.\\
3 - Oh, honey, please not tonight.\\
4 - It's freezing.\\
5 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
6 -     I don't know    \\
7 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     Life is unfair.    \\
17 - What do you think?\\
18 - More salt? More cilantro? A little zing of Tabasco?\\
19 - It's perfect.\\
20 - I can't taste anymore.\\
21 - Okay, dips--\\
22 - creamy, salsa, crab and compote.\\
23 - Chips--\\
24 - potato, corn, blue corn, sour cream and onion,\\
25 - salt and vinegar, kettle, and baked.\\
26 - How much did this table cost?\\
27 - Is this why I didn't get a birthday present?\\
28 - Hey, this is my first time hosting the poker game,\\
29 - and I want everything perfect when my friends come over.\\
30 - Or at least better than their stuff.\\
31 - Ooh, I almost forgot.\\
32 - Do you know Brian's daughter, Chandra?\\
33 - Of course. Yeah.\\
34 - Well, Brian's bringing her over tonight,\\
35 - and I think she's bringing a friend.\\
36 - Kristen?\\
37 - Uh, yeah, something.\\
38 - But Brian is playing poker.\\
39 - So I need you two to entertain them, understand?\\
40 - Uh-huh. Now, I mean it, guys.\\
41 - I don't want you bothering us.\\
42 - I want you and those girls in your room all night\\
43 - with the door closed.\\
44 - Got it?\\
45 - There's your birthday present.\\
46 - Who's Chandra?\\
47 - She's no one to you. Understood?\\
48 - If you set one foot in our room tonight,\\
49 - you are dead.\\
50 - Where am I supposed to go?\\
51 - I don't care.\\
52 - But if I see you tonight,\\
53 - I will Charlie-horse every muscle in your body.\\
54 - But... It disturbs me\\
55 - how much I enjoyed that.\\
56 - Don't make me do it again.\\
57 - Hi, honey. Hello.\\
58 - You're working late tonight, right?\\
59 - Yeah, 10:30 at least.\\
60 - Okay, good. Something came up.\\
61 - I've got to have dinner with someone.\\
62 - Who? No one.\\
63 - I mean, it's just\\
64 - some old business I have to take care of\\
65 - and I don't really want to talk about it now, okay?\\
66 - Well, can I help?\\
67 - No, it's fine.\\
68 - I promise, I'll tell you everything when you get home.\\
69 - Okay. Thanks.\\
70 - Don't worry. He'll be gone by the time you get back.\\
71 - Did you catch that "he" part?\\
72 - Hi, Hal.\\
73 - Hey, Brian, how are you?\\
74 - They're here.\\
75 - Get out.\\
76 - Boys,\\
77 - I know you know Brian\\
78 - and I think you kids know each other.\\
79 - Yeah. Yeah. No. No.\\
80 - Anyway, we're going to leave you kids to entertain yourselves.\\
81 - Yes, your father and I\\
82 - have to conduct some business.\\
83 - It seems that he has some of my money in his wallet.\\
84 - Bring it on. All right.\\
85 - May I take your wrap?\\
86 - Listen, just 'cause my dad dragged us to this dump\\
87 - doesn't mean we have to talk to you.\\
88 - Just show us where we can sit\\
89 - where we won't catch fleas.\\
90 - I'm gonna go see what Dewey's doing.\\
91 - Hey.\\
92 - Oh, you're Stevie,\\
93 - right?\\
94 - Can we help you in?\\
95 - I'm not...\\
96 - deaf.\\
97 - Did you hear him breathe?\\
98 - Aw...\\
99 - All right, did you hear the one\\
100 - about the astronaut and the hooker?\\
101 - Yeah.\\
102 - I didn't get it.\\
103 - Dewey, I told you to stay in your room. But Reese said...\\
104 - No, Dewey, this is man time.\\
105 - You can't be here.\\
106 - How's the dip?\\
107 - Hey, Hal, this is\\
108 - a sweet table.\\
109 - What is it, a 52-incher?\\
110 - Yes, sirree.\\
111 - Nice. I got the 54. Yeah, but\\
112 - you don't have the built-in drink holders like I do.\\
113 - Or the extra-padded leather around the edges like mine.\\
114 - You can play all night\\
115 - and not feel it in your wrists the next day.\\
116 - Oh, but this is nice, too, Hal. Sweet.\\
117 - Sweet.\\
118 - Hoe do you live your life with only three keys?\\
119 - I've got five. I've got nine. I got seven.\\
120 - Guys, guys, guys, do we have to do this every week?\\
121 - You're right.\\
122 - So, uh, how's the kids?\\
123 - You're just asking about his kids\\
124 - so you can talk about yours.\\
125 - Hey, why shouldn't I?\\
126 - Did I tell you that James was made\\
127 - captain of the wrestling team?\\
128 - Stevie just wrote a brand-new antivirus program.\\
129 - My daughter's essay scored her a trip to the White House.\\
130 - Malcolm has an IQ of 165.\\
131 - We know.\\
132 - You've been using that for six months.\\
133 - Would you like something\\
134 - from the kitchen?\\
135 - No...\\
136 - thank you.\\
137 - He doesn't want anything.\\
138 - You think they'll offer to change his diapers?\\
139 - I can't believe Stevie's putting up with this.\\
140 - Maybe we should get him a blanket. You know what?\\
141 - I'll take care of it. Would you like a blanket?\\
142 - Girls, let me explain\\
143 - something to you about Stevie.\\
144 - He's no different than the rest of us.\\
145 - He plays video games.\\
146 - He does chores around the house.\\
147 - He goes to the movies with friends.\\
148 - He leads a completely normal life.\\
149 - Which makes it even sadder\\
150 - that he only has two months to live.\\
151 - What? What?\\
152 - Stevie, they have a right to know.\\
153 - Oh, my God.\\
154 - Is it true?\\
155 - I've been told...\\
156 - I'm very brave.\\
157 - Oh.\\
158 - 129.\\
159 - That didn't beat Malik.\\
160 - So, Malik wins\\
161 - the breath-holding.\\
162 - Abe got the most dip on a chip.\\
163 - Trey has the longest neck.\\
164 - Steve has the highest socks,\\
165 - and Hal, well,\\
166 - Hal has nothing so far.\\
167 - Yeah, the doctors are baffled.\\
168 - Stevie's brain is growing too big for his head.\\
169 - It's pressing up against his skull.\\
170 - They say he only has two months before it explodes.\\
171 - It's called...\\
172 - encephalo...\\
173 - neuryop...\\
174 - alitis.\\
175 - How horrible. Oh, God.\\
176 - What do you think you're doing?\\
177 - Helping Stevie.\\
178 - It's okay.\\
179 - It's weird, but it feels good helping people.\\
180 - I like being the hero.\\
181 - You're pimping a fatal disease to take advantage of a girl.\\
182 - For good.\\
183 - Stevie, this is so unfair.\\
184 - I have...\\
185 - no regrets.\\
186 - Well...\\
187 - one.\\
188 - "Old business." What do you think that means? I don't know.\\
189 - You think it's an old boyfriend or something?\\
190 - You know, I have no idea what it is.\\
191 - Sometimes those old\\
192 - relationships can really get a hold on you.\\
193 - Hey, what's up with her ex-husband?\\
194 - He's still in jail.\\
195 - Didn't his parole hearing just come up?\\
196 - I don't know. Maybe.\\
197 - Look, she'll tell me about it tonight.\\
198 - Whatever it is.\\
199 - Man, I really admire your maturity. Thank you.\\
200 - I'm the complete opposite.\\
201 - I overanalyze everything.\\
202 - Like how Piama didn't kiss you good-bye.\\
203 - I'd be totally fixated on that.\\
204 - Or her ex-husband being locked up without a woman\\
205 - for five years.\\
206 - That's what's wrong with me.\\
207 - One suspicious conversation\\
208 - and immediately I'm picturing\\
209 - sweaty bodies rolling around\\
210 - in front of a fireplace.\\
211 - God, I got a lot of growing up to do.\\
212 - What are you doing here?\\
213 - Get out.\\
214 - You kicked me out of my room already,\\
215 - so I have nowhere else to go.\\
216 - That's not my problem.\\
217 - And I don't want to hear you crying.\\
218 - It's a real mood-killer.\\
219 - Thanks, Chandra.\\
220 - This light's much better for his eyes.\\
221 - The music...\\
222 - helps regulate...\\
223 - my heartbeat.\\
224 - I just have to go call his vitals in to the doctor.\\
225 - Missing something?\\
226 - What did you do with it?\\
227 - What do you think you're doing with a gun?\\
228 - Are you insane? Give it back.\\
229 - No. You don't bring a gun into this house.\\
230 - You don't get to have a gun.\\
231 - Where is it?\\
232 - This is where my family lives.\\
233 - You don't even know them and you bring a gun here?\\
234 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
235 - You'd better tell me where it is.\\
236 - No way, you can't have a gun.\\
237 - It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.\\
238 - I'm just holding it for him\\
239 - because his parents search his room.\\
240 - Well, they should.\\
241 - He's got a gun.\\
242 - Tell me where it is.\\
243 - No.\\
244 - That's not even mine.\\
245 - Don't you have anything in this house that isn't junk?!\\
246 - No.\\
247 - Damn! Big deal.\\
248 - Who can stuff the most pretzels in their mouth at one time?\\
249 - Okay, who can throw a potato chip the farthest?\\
250 - I've never met anyone who was going to die before.\\
251 - We're all dying.\\
252 - I'm just...\\
253 - going...\\
254 - before Thanksgiving.\\
255 - That's terrible.\\
256 - It makes me...\\
257 - appreciate...\\
258 - the time...\\
259 - I have.\\
260 - Wow, that's beautiful.\\
261 - You're so...\\
262 - alive.\\
263 - Can I...\\
264 - tongue-kiss you?\\
265 - What? I-I'm sorry.\\
266 - The pressure...\\
267 - on my brain...\\
268 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
269 - What are you doing here?!\\
270 - What do you think?\\
271 - Go pee outside.\\
272 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
273 - Out.\\
274 - At the tone, the time will be\\
275 - 8:22 and 30 seconds.\\
276 - Bam!\\
277 - Right to the millisecond.\\
278 - I'm two seconds off. I'm three.\\
279 - Same here.\\
280 - Hal, you don't even have a minute hand.\\
281 - Well, it's, it's really more of a decorative piece.\\
282 - Where is it?\\
283 - Where's what?\\
284 - Full house\\
285 - nines over aces.\\
286 - Yeah, looks like I'm on a roll.\\
287 - And I expect to stay on one\\
288 - once I get home to Alana, if you know what I mean.\\
289 - So, what is this, the third Wednesday of the month?\\
290 - Ooh! Hey, I do fine, thank you very much.\\
291 - Oh, yeah?\\
292 - What's the number?\\
293 - Whoa-whoa-whoa, we're not going to do this.\\
294 - Just deal the cards, will you?\\
295 - Three.\\
296 - Four. Four.\\
297 - Five.\\
298 - Two.\\
299 - Two? Ouch.\\
300 - Just twice a week?\\
301 - Oh, per week-- oh, then...\\
302 - Fourteen.\\
303 - 14? Come on.\\
304 - No way.\\
305 - No, he's telling the truth.\\
306 - Believe me. I went on vacation with him.\\
307 - If anything, he's underselling himself.\\
308 - Well, I... guess I win.\\
309 - I mean, it's really none of your business.\\
310 - I don't care\\
311 - how high you wear your socks.\\
312 - You ain't beating that.\\
313 - Hey, hats off to you, man.\\
314 - Yeah, now we know why you're so bad at poker.\\
315 - I don't even know how you can keep your eyes open.\\
316 - Oh, you'd better watch it, Hal.\\
317 - She must be angling for something big.\\
318 - What are you talking about?\\
319 - Well, you know she's gonna want\\
320 - something in exchange.\\
321 - You don't get anything free with women.\\
322 - Listen to you.\\
323 - With that attitude\\
324 - it's no wonder you're not doing any better.\\
325 - Ooh...\\
326 - Well, don't put that on me, pal.\\
327 - Uh, can we...? Let me ask you something.\\
328 - When was the last time you sent your wife flowers?\\
329 - Well, how come it's always the man\\
330 - that has to send the flowers?\\
331 - I would love to get some flowers.\\
332 - Might as well stretch.\\
333 - This is going to take a while.\\
334 - Did you ever stop to think\\
335 - that women are independent\\
336 - human beings\\
337 - who can make their own...\\
338 - ...choices?\\
339 - If you look at any successful relationship\\
340 - you'll find one common element at their core: trust.\\
341 - That's fine, Francis,\\
342 - but I really didn't need the hour-and-20-minute speech.\\
343 - I was just going to ask if you wanted to take off early\\
344 - 'cause I was willing to cover your shift,\\
345 - but evidently you're not concerned, so I...\\
346 - You like...\\
347 - this?\\
348 - Oh, yeah.\\
349 - You know something, Stevie?\\
350 - Maybe it was meant for me\\
351 - to be here with you, you know?\\
352 - I mean, wasn't it fate\\
353 - that made Dawson's Creek a rerun so I came here?\\
354 - I guess... fate... can be kind... too.\\
355 - Oh, this is so awful.\\
356 - Stop.\\
357 - It's okay.\\
358 - No, it's not okay.\\
359 - I just keep thinking about everything\\
360 - you're going to miss out on.\\
361 - You're never going to grow up.\\
362 - You're never going to go to your prom.\\
363 - I mean, you're never\\
364 - going to know what it's like to be loved.\\
365 - What I'm thinking about doing--\\
366 - it goes against everything I believe in, okay?\\
367 - But then, I don't even know what I believe in anymore.\\
368 - It's like,\\
369 - what kind of a God could just let you die like this?!\\
370 - I'll ask... when I see him.\\
371 - When was the last time\\
372 - you just made time to talk to her?!\\
373 - You're perfectly happy\\
374 - just closing off\\
375 - and not sharing your feelings.\\
376 - Why don't you just get off my back?!\\
377 - There it is!\\
378 - You're shutting me out!\\
379 - Why can't you just talk to me?!\\
380 - So that you can twist my words around\\
381 - and just throw them back at me?\\
382 - How many times do I have to apologize for that?!\\
383 - You've been drinking, haven't you?\\
384 - Well, I warned you,\\
385 - but you didn't give me any other choice.\\
386 - Now my boyfriend's coming over\\
387 - and he's going to get that gun from you one way or another.\\
388 - Oh, little Markie Rosenbaum's\\
389 - going to come over and scare me.\\
390 - I broke up with Markie.\\
391 - I'm dating Derek Fowler.\\
392 - Derek Fowler?!\\
393 - He's a psycho!\\
394 - What happened to Markie?!\\
395 - I loved Markie!\\
396 - You guys were great together!\\
397 - You know, Derek's going to make you tell him\\
398 - where that gun is.\\
399 - Where are you going?\\
400 - I don't want to be anywhere near here\\
401 - when he shows up.\\
402 - Chandra, I'm going home!\\
403 - Sayo... nara.\\
404 - Well, maybe I'll just call the cops.\\
405 - Go ahead.\\
406 - Let's hope they get here first.\\
407 - That's it!\\
408 - I've had it!\\
409 - Dewey, shut up!\\
410 - You guys broke all my stuff!\\
411 - Look, I've got something good going on in there\\
412 - and I don't want you to ruin it.\\
413 - This is all I have left!\\
414 - There. Now you got nothing to worry about.\\
415 - End of discussion.\\
416 - Oh, my God.\\
417 - How can a night that started out so badly\\
418 - get even worse?\\
419 - Wait.\\
420 - Don't panic.\\
421 - Think for a second.\\
422 - No, this is good.\\
423 - This is sensible.\\
424 - I make those kind of statements\\
425 - and just assume that she knows I'm sorry.\\
426 - And you know what?\\
427 - That's not right.\\
428 - She deserves better than that.\\
429 - That's all I needed to hear.\\
430 - I'm going to call that woman up\\
431 - and tell her just how much I love her.\\
432 - Hello?\\
433 - Earl, is that you?\\
434 - Earl, what the hell you doing at my house?\\
435 - Hello?\\
436 - I-I'm, I'm going to go home now\\
437 - 'cause I-I got a thing to do tomorrow.\\
438 - Well, I guess the game's over.\\
439 - Yeah.\\
440 - You know, I've wondered why Earl\\
441 - never came to the game.\\
442 - Dad, I've tried\\
443 - to be understanding about all this,\\
444 - but there is a limit.\\
445 - You have a right to know what's going on in this house.\\
446 - Dewey, now is not the time to be...\\
447 - Normally, I don't mind\\
448 - being a snitch, but this even makes me sad.\\
449 - This is what your son is up to.\\
450 - Stevie! What are you doing?!\\
451 - Where's Reese?!\\
452 - I was about to take a scented bath.\\
453 - Is something going on?\\
454 - Lamb chop! Put your sweater on!\\
455 - Dad... I...\\
456 - Stevie, how cou...?\\
457 - It's not...\\
458 - what it looks like.\\
459 - Well, it looks...\\
460 - like she was on your lap!\\
461 - Oh, my God, his head exploded!\\
462 - Abe, are you okay?\\
463 - I think so.\\
464 - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!\\
465 - Is everyone okay?!\\
466 - I mean... what was that?\\
467 - Face it, Dad.\\
468 - You were a crappy father.\\
469 - All you ever cared about\\
470 - was women, drinking, and stealing.\\
471 - You know what?\\
472 - I can't talk about this anymore.\\
473 - How many times do I have to say it?\\
474 - I need money!\\
475 - Guess who's home.\\
476 - What are you doing here?!\\
477 - I got off early.\\
478 - Hello. I'm Francis, Piama's husband.\\
479 - You're married?\\
480 - Hmm...\\
481 - Didn't think that was worth mentioning?\\
482 - Very cozy.\\
483 - Francis, I told you I...\\
484 - Hey, I had a life before I met you.\\
485 - Maybe I haven't been fair to you.\\
486 - I mean, our relationship wasn't all bad.\\
487 - Remember all the tickle fights?\\
488 - Oh, yeah, those were wild.\\
489 - I remember this one time\\
490 - we were taking a bath together, and she started squirming...\\
491 - Ah! No, I don't want to hear this!\\
492 - Aw, come on.\\
493 - It's a funny story, Francis.\\
494 - And he loves telling it, don't you, Dad?\\
495 - "Dad"?\\
496 - Yup.\\
497 - I just... Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.\\
498 - I just... I mean, it's a real pleasure\\
499 - to meet you, sir.\\
500 - Do you have any money?\\
501 - No.\\
502 - Well, tonight's been a big ball of nothing.\\
503 - I'm going to go finish off my shift.\\
504 - Love you, honey!\\
505 - You are never seeing that girl again.\\
506 - And you sure as hell\\
507 - are never seeing that boy again.\\
508 - You know what?\\
509 - You are not seeing daylight for the next six months.\\
510 - Just tell me what happened.\\
511 - We... were playing...\\
512 - cards.\\
513 - Okay.\\
514 - Let's start with you.\\
515 - Well...\\
516 - it's like...\\
517 - ...this.\\
518 - So, let me see.\\
519 - You found a gun.\\
520 - Didn't tell your father.\\
521 - Handled it, hid it inside the house.\\
522 - Handled it again to move it\\
523 - and tried to destroy it with a hacksaw.\\
524 - And at no point did you contact the police\\
525 - until after the gun went off.\\
526 - Yes.\\
527 - What did you say your IQ was?\\
528 - Man, what a night.\\
529 - When that thing went off,\\
530 - I couldn't believe how scared I was.\\
531 - You were scared?\\
532 - Hey, I was way more scared than you guys.\\
533 - Are you kidding me?\\
534 - I screamed like a little girl.\\
535 - Puh-leeze! I could have broke glass the way I screamed.\\
536 - You sounded like a hero compared to how I...

1 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
2 -     I don't know    \\
3 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
4 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
5 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     And you're not so big    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     Life is unfair.    \\
13 - This is stupid.\\
14 - We didn't do anything.\\
15 - What do we need a psychiatrist for?\\
16 - I don't want to hear it.\\
17 - We need professional help.\\
18 - Hello.\\
19 - Hi, thanks for squeezing us in.\\
20 - Why do we all have to be here?\\
21 - He's the one that's afraid of being\\
22 - attacked by a shark in the shower!\\
23 - At least he doesn't walk in his sleep\\
24 - and pee on the TV!\\
25 - At-at-at-at-at!\\
26 - My wife told you about the car?\\
27 - Yes, the joyriding incident.\\
28 - $700 worth of damage!\\
29 - Look, we are at our wit's end with these boys.\\
30 - I am authorizing you to do whatever it takes.\\
31 - Drugs, brainwashing, electroshock...\\
32 - Maybe I'll start with talking to them.\\
33 - You're the expert.\\
34 - You do whatever the doctor says.\\
35 - You better be cured when I get back.\\
36 - Well, looks like we have some work to do, don't we?\\
37 - Take a seat.\\
38 - So, let's go over the ground rules.\\
39 - This is a safe zone.\\
40 - What that means is when one of you talks,\\
41 - everybody listens\\
42 - and listening does not include interrupting, name-calling,\\
43 - or passing judgment on what was just said.\\
44 - That way everybody can say what they want\\
45 - and feel okay about it.\\
46 - Can I have a piece of candy?\\
47 - No.\\
48 - This is ridiculous.\\
49 - We didn't take their car out.\\
50 - We were watching TV all night.\\
51 - We were being good.\\
52 - I mean, I had some stuff scheduled for later, but...\\
53 - There was a lot of damage done to that car.\\
54 - Somebody else must have\\
55 - driven it, 'cause it wasn't us.\\
56 - Okay, let's back up.\\
57 - Let's talk about the home.\\
58 - It's a dump. There's a leak in the roof\\
59 - right over my bed.\\
60 - No, no, I mean I'd like to know about your family life.\\
61 - Look, don't analyze us.\\
62 - You can poke and prod and delve all you want,\\
63 - but you're not going to find any psychological issues, okay?\\
64 - We're normal!\\
65 - I hate my brothers.\\
66 - I only like me.\\
67 - I hate my brothers.\\
68 - I only like me.\\
69 - I hate my brothers...\\
70 - Stop it right now! I mean it!\\
71 - When are you going to be done?\\
72 - Soon as I can, honey.\\
73 - I said stop it!\\
74 - I hate my brothers.\\
75 - I only like me.\\
76 - I hate my brothers.\\
77 - I only like me.\\
78 - Five Across: "My Mother the... blank."\\
79 - What'd you do?\\
80 - What?\\
81 - Don't give me that. What'd you do?\\
82 - Nothing.\\
83 - Mom, I'm trying to study.\\
84 - Oh.\\
85 - Then I'm sure you don't mind if I, uh...\\
86 - took a look in here!\\
87 - Mom, I'm telling you,\\
88 - we didn't do anything.\\
89 - Oh, you boys are up to something.\\
90 - I can smell it.\\
91 - If you've broken another window\\
92 - it is going to come out of your...\\
93 - Are you done?\\
94 - You want to frisk me?\\
95 - You just consider yourselves lucky.\\
96 - This time.\\
97 - That was close.\\
98 - Our only problem is\\
99 - our parents think we're lying and we're not.\\
100 - Hey, a breakthrough.\\
101 - You're obviously a very bright young man.\\
102 - Would you like to spend the rest of the hour\\
103 - telling me how bright you are?\\
104 - Okay, let's talk about your parents.\\
105 - Now, if you had to describe them in a few words,\\
106 - how would you do that?\\
107 - I don't know.\\
108 - Mom is... Mom.\\
109 - Everybody up!\\
110 - I have to do laundry before work!\\
111 - I am taking breakfast off the table in five minutes!\\
112 - And Dad's...\\
113 - What is Dad?\\
114 - Who wants to make five bucks?\\
115 - How? I need someone to take the fall.\\
116 - Oh, my God.\\
117 - What did you do?\\
118 - I can't tell you.\\
119 - Yes or no, no questions asked.\\
120 - Oh, my God!!\\
121 - Make it ten.\\
122 - Done.\\
123 - Oh, my God!\\
124 - You're a good son.\\
125 - I got him, honey!\\
126 - I got him, don't worry!\\
127 - And you have another brother, Francis?\\
128 - Yeah. Did they tell you what they did to him?\\
129 - It's a classic firstborn scenario.\\
130 - A free and easy couple suddenly has a kid\\
131 - and their whole world's turned upside down,\\
132 - and even after there's other kids,\\
133 - the oldest one becomes a symbol\\
134 - for everything that's wrong in their lives\\
135 - through no fault of his own.\\
136 - Dad, I know what you're going to say,\\
137 - and believe me, I totally agree with you.\\
138 - There is no excuse for what I did.\\
139 - It was idiotic, immature, totally reckless\\
140 - and I'm really sorry.\\
141 - I'm just... I'm hoping against hope\\
142 - that you will give me another chance, which I admit\\
143 - I don't deserve,\\
144 - but if you could just find it in your heart to forgive me,\\
145 - I know I could earn your trust back.\\
146 - They had it out for him from the start.\\
147 - Boy, you guys really have a lot of issues with your parents.\\
148 - Do you ever discuss any of this with them?\\
149 - You never tell your parents your feelings?\\
150 - We try. Two weeks ago,\\
151 - I put some newspapers in the blender and set it on fire.\\
152 - That was totally a cry for help.\\
153 - I mean talk, with words.\\
154 - You know, talk about the subject at hand?\\
155 - You know, a lot of families do that around the dinner table.\\
156 - That can be a really good environment\\
157 - for sharing your feelings.\\
158 - Great pancakes, Dad.\\
159 - Oh, thanks.\\
160 - Hey, who's ready for seconds?\\
161 - I am.\\
162 - Here are the house rules:\\
163 - You can't reach for seconds\\
164 - until you're finished with your firsts\\
165 - but as soon as anybody's fork\\
166 - leaves the perimeter of their plate,\\
167 - all bets are off.\\
168 - It's mine!\\
169 - And then there's a big explosion\\
170 - and lots of bubbles.\\
171 - That's where babies come from.\\
172 - Oh, well, you know, close enough.\\
173 - Look at this.\\
174 - I made a pea angel.\\
175 - Oh, you're a pea angel.\\
176 - Stop playing with your food.\\
177 - Oh, Mom...\\
178 - Don't you dare.\\
179 - Relax. I wasn't really going to.\\
180 - Then don't.\\
181 - I wasn't going to.\\
182 - Then don't.\\
183 - Well, don't accuse me of something\\
184 - that I wasn't going to do!\\
185 - Interesting mood shift.\\
186 - It would take hours to explain the psychology behind this\\
187 - so let me just put it this way:\\
188 - Dynamite.\\
189 - Kid with matches.\\
190 - You're going to throw that at Mom?\\
191 - I wasn't going to!\\
192 - Geez Louise-- Reese...\\
193 - Hal, I can handle this.\\
194 - Reese, I'm warning you.\\
195 - I wasn't going to, but if you think I would\\
196 - then maybe I should.\\
197 - Oh, good, now he's panicking.\\
198 - Just put the spoon down and apologize.\\
199 - Okay, she gave him an out.\\
200 - Apologize for what?\\
201 - I wasn't going to do anything!\\
202 - Just stop talking!\\
203 - Just stop talking and let me think!\\
204 - Dad, do something.\\
205 - I got it.\\
206 - What do you think you're doing?\\
207 - I'm being cute and spontaneous?\\
208 - Don't do it.\\
209 - I wasn't going to!\\
210 - Who cares if they don't believe me about the car?\\
211 - I've gotten this far in my life\\
212 - without anyone giving me any credit\\
213 - so why should I expect anything different now?\\
214 - Yeah, the guy who leaves thumbtacks\\
215 - on the toilet seat is so misunderstood.\\
216 - Please remember the ground rules: there's no...\\
217 - You're the one who taught me my name in French was "latrine."\\
218 - Don't interrupt. You're the one\\
219 - who sold my bike for three bucks\\
220 - to Billy Watson the day he moved to Canada!\\
221 - We don't... I'm the one who spit in Dewey's cereal this morning.\\
222 - I mean...\\
223 - I drank that milk!\\
224 - I licked the bowl!\\
225 - I hate you!\\
226 - Oh, shut up, pit stain.\\
227 - Leave him alone. You started it.\\
228 - Shut up! Shut up! You shut up!\\
229 - Stop it!\\
230 - This is not how therapy works.\\
231 - You are going to respect each other\\
232 - and damn it, you are going to respect me.\\
233 - You're going to behave\\
234 - and we are going to continue with this session!\\
235 - Understood?\\
236 - Stop it!\\
237 - This is a safe zone! Get off me.\\
238 - A safe zone!\\
239 - Stupid...\\
240 - Here is what you boys need to know.\\
241 - You cannot break me.\\
242 - I've worked in prisons.\\
243 - I had a 17-year-old serial killer hugging my knees\\
244 - and crying like a little girl.\\
245 - Those aren't Fisher-Price diplomas on the wall.\\
246 - I went to Harvard.\\
247 - I had a starring role in The Mikado!\\
248 - My arms are tired.\\
249 - Don't give him the satisfaction, Dewey.\\
250 - This is nothing.\\
251 - Mom makes us do this out in the rain.\\
252 - Okay, you can relax.\\
253 - All right, let's try this.\\
254 - If you could pick one thing,\\
255 - about the way your parents treat you\\
256 - what would you change?\\
257 - The biggest problem is that they don't trust us.\\
258 - They just assume that if they leave us alone\\
259 - for two seconds, we'll get in trouble.\\
260 - Nine days past expiration.\\
261 - Ugh.\\
262 - Expired two months ago.\\
263 - You don't have the guts.\\
264 - When was the last Christmas we had eggnog?\\
265 - I think before Dewey.\\
266 - It's all you, man.\\
267 - Bottom of the ninth...\\
268 - two outs... man on first.\\
269 - The windup...\\
270 - ...the pitch...\\
271 - Uh-oh.\\
272 - Oh, man, we're so dead.\\
273 - That's it, game over.\\
274 - Yeah.\\
275 - So I win. What?\\
276 - Past the lamp is a home run.\\
277 - Two men scored.\\
278 - That was a foul ball.\\
279 - Are you crazy?\\
280 - It went right down the line.\\
281 - It was foul. Shut up!\\
282 - You're home plate, you don't get a vote.\\
283 - Do over. Fine by me.\\
284 - Oh, crap!\\
285 - Now we really have to quit.\\
286 - Yeah. But that was a triple.\\
287 - Get back up there.\\
288 - Let me ask you...\\
289 - how do you see yourselves?\\
290 - Reese, what do you think your role in the family is?\\
291 - I guess I'm the bad boy.\\
292 - The one that ruins everything.\\
293 - Every family has that guy.\\
294 - The one that makes you cry,\\
295 - makes you hate coming home at the end of the day\\
296 - just knowing I'm going to be there.\\
297 - It's a lot of work, but... I guess it's pretty satisfying.\\
298 - What are you looking at, monkey boy?\\
299 - Ow!\\
300 - Ow! Ow!\\
301 - Reese! What are you doing?\\
302 - Help! Ow! Help!\\
303 - Mom!\\
304 - Help! Ow! Ow! Come on, cut it out, cut it out.\\
305 - Help! It hurts! Ow!\\
306 - Knock it off, you little... Reese!\\
307 - What the heck are you doing?\\
308 - Honest to God, you can't leave that kid alone for five minutes\\
309 - without picking on him! I didn't do anything though.\\
310 - Go! He's lying.\\
311 - Whatcha looking at?\\
312 - Reese's report card.\\
313 - It is much better than last time.\\
314 - Really? Yeah.\\
315 - This time he used the exact same brand of pen as the teacher\\
316 - to change his grade.\\
317 - Look at that.\\
318 - He gave himself a C in math instead of an A+.\\
319 - Yeah, subtle. Nice attention to detail.\\
320 - He's really learning.\\
321 - Two months grounded?\\
322 - Three months, scrubbing toilets.\\
323 - And how do you see your place in this family?\\
324 - Well, I'm the favorite.\\
325 - You know, the one everybody loves the most.\\
326 - The cute one.\\
327 - The one everybody looks out for and gives presents to.\\
328 - And sometimes they even make the birds sing to me\\
329 - or the clouds spell out my name.\\
330 - Come on!\\
331 - You said I could play.\\
332 - You have to go down there again.\\
333 - No.\\
334 - Come on, you're the only one that'll fit.\\
335 - No, I always go get it\\
336 - and you never let me play.\\
337 - We'll let you play.\\
338 - We promise.\\
339 - Come on! Throw it here.\\
340 - You promised.\\
341 - No way.\\
342 - What? Can't sleep?\\
343 - No, I have this terrible feeling\\
344 - we've forgotten something.\\
345 - Trash, locks, lights...\\
346 - Oh, well.\\
347 - Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait till morning.\\
348 - Oh, boy.\\
349 - All right, son.\\
350 - Son, I think you've learned your lesson.\\
351 - Okay.\\
352 - Thanks, Dad.\\
353 - We've got to stop doing this.\\
354 - Hup!\\
355 - I try not to throw it in their faces,\\
356 - but sometimes, you know,\\
357 - I just can't help it.\\
358 - What about you, Malcolm?\\
359 - What's your place in the family?\\
360 - I don't know, I'm the middle one.\\
361 - Well, really think about it.\\
362 - How do you fit in with this family?\\
363 - Well... I...\\
364 - Go ahead.\\
365 - Well, I guess I...\\
366 - don't.\\
367 - I don't fit in.\\
368 - I mean, honestly,\\
369 - sometimes I feel like\\
370 - I've just been dropped into this family\\
371 - from outer space.\\
372 - Well, that's interesting. Now, how...\\
373 - Well, he's the one that fixes everything.\\
374 - What? Yeah, you know,\\
375 - he's the one that figures everything out\\
376 - and solves a lot of our problems.\\
377 - Yeah, kind of like that gay kid with the scarf on Scooby-Doo.\\
378 - The leader.\\
379 - You guys think that?\\
380 - Well, sure they do.\\
381 - I mean, it's pretty obvious\\
382 - that you're the ring leader.\\
383 - What?\\
384 - It happens all the time.\\
385 - An intelligent, sensitive kid with poor impulse control.\\
386 - I mean, you're surrounded by people\\
387 - who don't challenge you mentally.\\
388 - So you start to get bored and you start looking for trouble.\\
389 - No, I don't.\\
390 - Isn't that what happened the other night?\\
391 - You're sitting on the couch with your brothers,\\
392 - nothing to do but watch TV,\\
393 - thinking the only way to end the crushing boredom\\
394 - is to stir up a little excitement?\\
395 - He didn't do it. None of us did.\\
396 - You know, there's a lot of options for a boy like you.\\
397 - I mean, there's placement programs, camps,\\
398 - special schools...\\
399 - Wait. You want to send me away?\\
400 - You can't do that. He's our brother.\\
401 - Calm down. I merely sug... I'm not going.\\
402 - You can't make him do this.\\
403 - We're good kids.\\
404 - Oh!\\
405 - Oh!\\
406 - Hal?\\
407 - I'm late for work.\\
408 - Aah!\\
409 - Don't do this.\\
410 - You can't leave me alone with Reese.\\
411 - I'm sorry, but we're out of time.\\
412 - What is the deal with this door?\\
413 - Is there some kind of baffling built into it?\\
414 - You have three very special boys here.\\
415 - I'd like to sit down with you and your wife so that we can...\\
416 - Dad, do you know\\
417 - what this idiot wants to do?!\\
418 - Malcolm, let me talk to the doctor, huh?\\
419 - Maybe we ought to speak privately.\\
420 - Sure. Boys, , go wait in the car.\\
421 - Where'd that come from?\\
422 - Hey, everyone all right?\\
423 - What?!\\
424 - That's my car!\\
425 - I know I set the brake.\\
426 - See?\\
427 - Just like the other night.\\
428 - We didn't take it out.\\
429 - It just rolled out by itself.\\
430 - Then you boys were actually telling us...\\
431 - the truth?\\
432 - You're a genius.\\
433 - Boys, let's go get you some ice cream, huh?\\
434 - Listen, there's a lot we have to...\\
435 - Oh, absolutely.\\
436 - You know, Doc, I have no idea how you did it.\\
437 - And in just an hour.\\
438 - I'm putting in a little extra for you.\\
439 - But...\\
440 - Thanks.\\
441 - Isn't it great to feel like a family again?\\
442 - Genius.\\
443 - Move! Shut up!\\
444 - Stop touching me.\\
445 - I'm not touching you. I was clipping on my tie.\\
446 - While you were touching me.\\
447 - Stop it. Why do we have to do this?\\
448 - Because we don't have a single picture of us all together.\\
449 - That's ridiculous.\\
450 - We're a family, we should have a family portrait.\\
451 - Well, Francis isn't here.\\
452 - I'm not going to cough up 200 bucks to fly him in\\
453 - for one silly picture.\\
454 - Where's Dewey?\\
455 - Dewey,\\
456 - get out of there.\\
457 - That's not your family.\\
458 - You sure you want "Autumn Leaves" as a backdrop?\\
459 - Yes. You didn't even looked at "Happy Windmills."\\
460 - It's more colorful.\\
461 - Ooh, "Space Shuttle." Next.\\
462 - I have a coupon here for one 8X10 and two wallet-size for $9.99\\
463 - and that's what I want.\\
464 - I don't want the Golden Moments Collection\\
465 - I don't want the Family and Friends Collection;\\
466 - I don't want the Lifetime of Love.\\
467 - I want one 8X10 and two wallet-size for $9.99.\\
468 - Fine.\\
469 - We have an installment plan if that would help.\\
470 - I brought a picture of Francis.\\
471 - He's going to be in the portrait.\\
472 - Cool, I'll hold it.\\
473 - No, I'm going to hold it.\\
474 - Let go. I'm going to hold it. Come on.\\
475 - Dewey. Dewey, pants on, mister.\\
476 - I'm sorry,\\
477 - but this coupon's expired. What?\\
478 - It's expired.\\
479 - What you want will run you $39.50.\\
480 - Ooh... "Lonely Beach."\\
481 - We're kind of the lonely beach family, right?\\
482 - Hal.\\
483 - But for another five dollars,\\
484 - you can have the "Instant Memories" set.\\
485 - That comes with double- exposure silhouettes\\
486 - for the grandparents.\\
487 - Look, could you please just do what I'm asking you to...\\
488 - I'm older! It was my idea!\\
489 - That is it!\\
490 - Get up!\\
491 - Get back!\\
492 - Come here!\\
493 - Go there!\\
494 - We are going to take\\
495 - this picture, and it is going\\
496 - to be good.\\
497 - And that means no faces, no tongues,\\
498 - no crossed eyes,\\
499 - no bunny ears.\\
500 - We are going to smile, we are going to look good,\\
501 - it is going to cost us $9.99\\
502 - and all of this is going to happen\\
503 - by the time I count to three.\\
504 - One, two, three.
\subsection {Episode 20: Jury Duty}
1 - What...?\\
2 - Those kids!\\
3 - Not my  Frampton Comes Alive.\\
4 - Ha-oh...!\\
5 - "Honest, Dad, we didn't even know you had a watch."\\
6 - Thank God they paved the driveway last year.\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Jury Duty?\\
20 - They want me to do jury duty?\\
21 - I can't believe this.\\
22 - You can't do it.\\
23 - You simply can't do it.\\
24 - Spring break is coming up.\\
25 - The boys are going to be out of school.\\
26 - I can't be expected to handle them by myself.\\
27 - I'm sorry, you're just going to have to tell them no!\\
28 - That's not one of the options, Hal.\\
29 - What are they thinking\\
30 - forcing someone to sit on a jury?\\
31 - This is America!\\
32 - I don't have a choice.\\
33 - Oh... yes, you do.\\
34 - You want to get out of jury duty?\\
35 - You just let me handle this.\\
36 - We, the jury, promise to faithfully uphold...\\
37 - This is going to be great.\\
38 - I've never been ice fishing before.\\
39 - It combines my two favorite things in life:\\
40 - ice and holes.\\
41 - Just a bunch of guys roughing it.\\
42 - A true test of courage and determination.\\
43 - Man against the elements.\\
44 - No crust on mine, please and thank you.\\
45 - I hope you guys packed\\
46 - enough toilet paper for four people.\\
47 - You're kidding me.\\
48 - How'd you get Piama to give you permission?\\
49 - I don't need my wife's permission.\\
50 - I baited her into a fight,\\
51 - and she kicked me out for a couple days.\\
52 - Oh, my God, Dewey.\\
53 - You're not going to believe what just happened.\\
54 - Where were you?\\
55 - We were supposed to go exploring in the sewer!\\
56 - I waited two hours for you! Dewey,\\
57 - you're not listening. This is incredible.\\
58 - But you promised!\\
59 - You said that when spring break started you would take me.\\
60 - I did all your chores, I did all your homework,\\
61 - I took your antibiotics for you, I put...\\
62 - Dewey, just shut up.\\
63 - We're trying to tell you something important.\\
64 - We just saw Stevie's mom naked.\\
65 - And she's a total babe.\\
66 - It was amazing.\\
67 - We were over at Stevie's\\
68 - getting stuff for the sewer\\
69 - when all of a sudden, we hear something behind us.\\
70 - We turn around and there she was.\\
71 - In the hallway. Naked!\\
72 - Buck-naked-- except for her shower cap.\\
73 - It was crazy. First she was screaming,\\
74 - then Stevie was screaming, then I was screaming...\\
75 - Yeah, why'd I do that?\\
76 - And then she tore the curtains off the wall to cover up.\\
77 - But you could still see right through the curtains.\\
78 - I'm so glad they just remodeled.\\
79 - That is not a good reason!\\
80 - Mom walks around here naked all the time!\\
81 - She was naked this morning. She was naked in the...\\
82 - Dewey... if you just combined those two things in my head\\
83 - I will kill you!\\
84 - No, we're good.\\
85 - So, anyway, she was crawling down the hall...\\
86 - Hal, I've got to get going.\\
87 - Where are the boys?\\
88 - They went to the library.\\
89 - I know, I know.\\
90 - But if they were doing something\\
91 - really dangerous, they'd have come up\\
92 - with a better lie.\\
93 - So...\\
94 - deliberations start today.\\
95 - Nervous? Nice try, Hal.\\
96 - You know I can't talk about the trial.\\
97 - Okay. Okay.\\
98 - So, is the councilman as tall as he seems to be on TV?\\
99 - Hal... I knew it!\\
100 - Your eyebrow went up. It did not.\\
101 - It's the panty bandit, isn't it?\\
102 - This isn't right, Lois.\\
103 - We're married.\\
104 - We tell each other everything.\\
105 - We've never kept secrets from each other\\
106 - in our entire relationship.\\
107 - What are you talking about?\\
108 - I keep secrets from you all the time.\\
109 - Oh, fine, go!\\
110 - Don't want to keep you from your big secret trial.\\
111 - Thank you very much.\\
112 - For what?\\
113 - Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.\\
114 - You didn't say a word.\\
115 - This sucks.\\
116 - We've been here 15 hours.\\
117 - We haven't caught a single fish.\\
118 - How much longer is this going to take?\\
119 - You never know.\\
120 - I've been ice fishing my entire life.\\
121 - Never even seen a fish.\\
122 - I'm with Francis.\\
123 - I got bored on the drive down here.\\
124 - Can we at least talk about something?\\
125 - About what? I don't know.\\
126 - We could use this opportunity\\
127 - to get to know each other a little better.\\
128 - You know, one time I walked in on my two dads making love.\\
129 - Guilty.\\
130 - Not guilty.\\
131 - And... guilty.\\
132 - That's seven guilty and five not guilty.\\
133 - So, I guess the point of contention for those of you\\
134 - who don't think that Marty did steal the motorcycle...\\
135 - Look, if it'll get us out of here earlier,\\
136 - I don't mind changing my vote. What?\\
137 - I don't feel that strongly either way.\\
138 - Yeah, me, too.\\
139 - Which side was winning again?\\
140 - This is not a question of winning.\\
141 - And I don't think we should be voting\\
142 - whichever way gets us out of here the fasted.\\
143 - Well, we have to have some basis for deciding.\\
144 - There was a trial. And evidence.\\
145 - And laws. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
146 - Let's just vote one more time\\
147 - before we, you know get into all that detail.\\
148 - We might just get lucky.\\
149 - Do the five people who voted not guilty\\
150 - want to change their votes?\\
151 - Me. Guilty. Whatever.\\
152 - There you go. It's unanimous.\\
153 - Wait. Wait!\\
154 - What do you think you're doing?!\\
155 - You can't send a 17-year-old kid to jail\\
156 - just because you want to go home early.\\
157 - For God's sake, we took an oath!\\
158 - Lady, did you vote guilty?\\
159 - Yes, because...\\
160 - Then there's no problem.\\
161 - We're all just agreeing with you.\\
162 - Let's go.\\
163 - Fine.\\
164 - Then I vote not guilty.\\
165 - This is cool.\\
166 - There's no alligators down here, right?\\
167 - No, that's just made up.\\
168 - But if there were, it'd probably be blind.\\
169 - Or albino. Or transparent!\\
170 - But that's not real.\\
171 - This is so cool.\\
172 - He hasn't shut up all morning.\\
173 - I mean, I was just as excited the first time Francis took us.\\
174 - It's actually kind of cute.\\
175 - Did you get the snake?\\
176 - Right here.\\
177 - They'll be able to hear him screaming in Russia.\\
178 - Dude, finish your story.\\
179 - Oh, right. So, then, we noticed\\
180 - she was standing there... buck-naked.\\
181 - And then I went like this...\\
182 - And then Malcolm was like this...\\
183 - It was incredible.\\
184 - The sun was coming through\\
185 - the window behind her.\\
186 - It looked like she was glowing.\\
187 - A naked, glowing angel.\\
188 - Hey, Stevie, back me up on this.\\
189 - That's what she looked like, right?\\
190 - Can we go now? I get the lead.\\
191 - No, rear.\\
192 - No, wait, front.\\
193 - I'll scout ahead.\\
194 - What? You're talking about his mom.\\
195 - Change the subject.\\
196 - Show some class.\\
197 - Oh, okay, I get it.\\
198 - Whoo, Stevie, is that you or the sewer?\\
199 - It turns out it wasn't\\
200 - a boil they removed\\
201 - but the vestiges of my unborn twin.\\
202 - Okay, let's just go.\\
203 - Yeah. That sounds good. Good idea.\\
204 - Best idea I've heard all day.\\
205 - Okay, here's something interesting.\\
206 - There's a gigantic bear out there.\\
207 - Don't worry about it.\\
208 - There are grizzlies all over.\\
209 - Just part of living in Alaska.\\
210 - How far away is it?\\
211 - (metal clattering, bear snarling)\\
212 - Well... answer the question.\\
213 - Uh, it's open.\\
214 - "The body was found..."\\
215 - I thought we were having lunch today.\\
216 - What? Oh, I'm sorry.\\
217 - I... What's all this?\\
218 - Uh, just some research I'm doing\\
219 - on the trial Lois got assigned to.\\
220 - My God. The Reyes case?\\
221 - Did she say anything about the four-fingered magician?\\
222 - Was he any good?\\
223 - She won't tell me  anything.\\
224 - I had to dig all this stuff up on my own.\\
225 - Half the information is being suppressed from the jury.\\
226 - Now Lois will have to find Monahan guilty.\\
227 - Why wouldn't she? He did it.\\
228 - Oh, you're a fool.\\
229 - Everyone knows that the wife killed him.\\
230 - What are you talking about?\\
231 - She loved him.\\
232 - Didn't you read the letter?\\
233 - If she was so innocent,\\
234 - how come she didn't admit to being married before?\\
235 - Because she was underage\\
236 - and it was annulled a week later.\\
237 - It means absolutely nothing.\\
238 - The judge already ruled that inadmissible.\\
239 - This is the same judge\\
240 - that wouldn't allow the cabdriver to testify!\\
241 - Well... if the wife did it,\\
242 - why did four witnesses say they saw a man leave the crime scene?\\
243 - Oh. You mean a man...\\
244 - like  this.\\
245 - You just drew hair on!\\
246 - And if I could do it, she could do it.\\
247 - Did you know that she spent two years working\\
248 - at the Windmill Dinner Theater?\\
249 - Let me see that.\\
250 - Okay, here's our mark.\\
251 - When we came down here with Francis,\\
252 - this is the farthest we've ever gone.\\
253 - This is it?\\
254 - This is as far as you went?\\
255 - Who would brag about this?\\
256 - Mr. Alligator?\\
257 - So, Stevie, did your mom go to college?\\
258 - What? You know.\\
259 - Did she get a degree or something?\\
260 - I'll bet she was in a sorority.\\
261 - Wait a minute. Unless we thought some girl\\
262 - named Molly Hatchet ruled, this isn't our mark.\\
263 - No, this has to be it.\\
264 - We went right, right, straight, left, right, left,\\
265 - straight, and right again.\\
266 - No. We went right, left, left,\\
267 - then straight, left, right, straight.\\
268 - No, we went... right... left...\\
269 - straight...\\
270 - Oh, man, we're lost!\\
271 - What?! No!\\
272 - Oh, man, what are we going to do?\\
273 - Nice. We'll get him crying and then pants him.\\
274 - No, we really are lost.\\
275 - What? What are we going to do?!\\
276 - I knew it. I knew you were going to find\\
277 - some way to ruin this for me.\\
278 - Even when you're trying\\
279 - to be nice, you make me miserable.\\
280 - And now, I get to die in the sewer.\\
281 - A perfect end\\
282 - to a crappy life!\\
283 - Shut up, Dewey. All right.\\
284 - Let's just focus on finding a way out of here.\\
285 - Stevie's mom must be worried about him.\\
286 - Shut up... about... my mom!\\
287 - What? I simply made a comment.\\
288 - You're... a perv.\\
289 - I can't help it\\
290 - if I have a healthy interest in the opposite sex.\\
291 - Well... they don't... return... the favor.\\
292 - What does that mean?\\
293 - Girls... hate you.\\
294 - That's not true.\\
295 - Yes, it is.\\
296 - Come on, Reese, you're a joke.\\
297 - Yeah, even I know it.\\
298 - So, Marty claims he was at work,\\
299 - but his boss says he didn't show up until 6:00.\\
300 - Now, we've got the attendant at the gas station\\
301 - who puts Marty's whereabouts there between 4:00 and 4:30.\\
302 - And as we all remember from the testimony...\\
303 - Can we vote again?\\
304 - What's the use?\\
305 - We've been through this five times.\\
306 - We vote guilty, she votes not guilty.\\
307 - We vote not guilty, she votes guilty.\\
308 - Yeah. So, you go first this time.\\
309 - All right. I abstain.\\
310 - What is it that you want, lady?\\
311 - I want you to do your job.\\
312 - I want you to weigh the facts\\
313 - of this case and make a reasoned decision.\\
314 - You have got the sworn testimony of the arresting police officer\\
315 - in which he clearly states... Yeah,\\
316 - if you believe what he says.\\
317 - Okay. That's fair enough.\\
318 - It is a question of credibility.\\
319 - On one hand you have\\
320 - a 17-year-old high school dropout\\
321 - with a history of reckless behavior.\\
322 - And on the other,\\
323 - you have a 20-year veteran of the police force.\\
324 - Well, you sure as hell can't trust the cops.\\
325 - They're always coming up with ways to get you.\\
326 - That's right.\\
327 - My neighbor's a cop and he's got\\
328 - a 30-foot boat in his front yard.\\
329 - Now, how can he afford a 30-foot boat\\
330 - on a policeman's salary?\\
331 - Cops are always getting away with stuff like that.\\
332 - And start now, I'll tell ya, when I was a kid...\\
333 - Stop.\\
334 - This is not about how you feel about cops.\\
335 - This is not about who you like and who you hate.\\
336 - This is about what you believe happened\\
337 - based on the facts of the trial.\\
338 - Did Marty, or did Marty not, in fact, steal the motorcycle?!\\
339 - Wait... I thought\\
340 - Marty was the cop. Yeah.\\
341 - Yeah, that's what I thought.\\
342 - Fine. Let's go through this again.\\
343 - Yes?\\
344 - Is it okay to hate you?\\
345 - Absolutely.\\
346 - But the money was really being funneled\\
347 - to Mr. Reyes' mistress and their love child.\\
348 - Once Monahan found out, it was "Good night, Mr. Reyes."\\
349 - You've got nothing.\\
350 - There were witnesses who saw him argue with the victim.\\
351 - He can't account for his whereabouts\\
352 - when the murder occurred\\
353 - and they found the murder weapon in his car.\\
354 - Means, motive and opportunity.\\
355 - It's all a little too neat.\\
356 - Because he's guilty.\\
357 - My gut says the partner didn't do it.\\
358 - Just saying so doesn't make it so.\\
359 - Talk to this guy.\\
360 - You're an idiot.\\
361 - Oh, my God, that thing's a monster.\\
362 - Calm down, I've been around bears for 40 years.\\
363 - There's nothing to worry about.\\
364 - Really? Yup.\\
365 - All we've got to do is stay real quiet.\\
366 - Pretty soon he'll get bored and fly away.\\
367 - That is unless he's protecting his eggs.\\
368 - This is crazy.\\
369 - We can't stay here.\\
370 - Somebody's got to make a run for the truck\\
371 - and go get help.\\
372 - That's a suicide mission.\\
373 - The bear will run down anyone that goes out there.\\
374 - Well, what are we supposed to do?\\
375 - We can't stay here and starve to death.\\
376 - He's right.\\
377 - I say we try it.\\
378 - I vote for Eric.\\
379 - What?! Go to hell.\\
380 - I'm not going out there.\\
381 - You go out there.\\
382 - Hey, I have a wife at home to take care of.\\
383 - Oh, and my life doesn't mean anything?\\
384 - How about Artie?\\
385 - He's the camp outcast.\\
386 - Big deal.\\
387 - Pete's just a toothless old coot.\\
388 - It's a miracle he's lived this long.\\
389 - I should have slit your throat when I had the chance.\\
390 - This all looks...\\
391 - the same.\\
392 - Yes, this is the same.\\
393 - It's all been exactly the same\\
394 - ever since the day I was born.\\
395 - I start to trust them.\\
396 - They make me regret it.\\
397 - I get my hopes up\\
398 - and then they destroy them.\\
399 - Shut up. We get it.\\
400 - Every girlfriend you ever had left you crying like a baby.\\
401 - What?\\
402 - Oh, who's Mr. Big Shot, now?\\
403 - I'm a joke with the girls, huh?\\
404 - Well, what's worse--\\
405 - being a joke, or being a crybaby?\\
406 - I wasn't crying that hard.\\
407 - You wet...\\
408 - your pants.\\
409 - Oh, like you've ever even been with a girl.\\
410 - I have...\\
411 - a note...\\
412 - from my doctor.\\
413 - I could get a doctor if I wanted to.\\
414 - That doesn't even make sense.\\
415 - That's right.\\
416 - Turn on each other.\\
417 - Well, you know what?\\
418 - No girls like\\
419 - any of you.\\
420 - And I don't blame them.\\
421 - You're all pathetic.\\
422 - You know who's a joke?\\
423 - Girls. Yeah.\\
424 - Why do we even like them?\\
425 - They make our lives miserable.\\
426 - You can never understand what they want.\\
427 - They're always saying, "Stop staring at me."\\
428 - And they don't laugh at farts.\\
429 - They only want to talk about clothes.\\
430 - They cry...\\
431 - all the time.\\
432 - Yeah, this is helping us get out.\\
433 - (heavy breathing approaching)\\
434 - Time! Time! Time!\\
435 - Eleven minutes.\\
436 - Ha!\\
437 - In your face!\\
438 - See, the wife did have time to run down here from home.\\
439 - That leaves her two minutes to stab him, remove the head\\
440 - and still make it to the party in time.\\
441 - It all makes sense.\\
442 - Oh, and the blood just magically jumped\\
443 - from the wife's clothes to Monahan.\\
444 - Do you really need this spelled out for you?\\
445 - After killing her husband,\\
446 - she ran back, took off the bloody suit\\
447 - and rubbed it all over the unconscious Monahan.\\
448 - Impossible.\\
449 - You just don't want to be proven wrong.\\
450 - I am not wrong.\\
451 - The knife entered at a downward angle.\\
452 - She was 5'2"; he was 6'4".\\
453 - She'd have had to ask him to pick her up\\
454 - so she could stab him.\\
455 - She could have stood on something.\\
456 - Oh, so she brought a stepladder with her to the alley.\\
457 - Look, right here is a milk crate.\\
458 - She could have hidden behind the Dumpster,\\
459 - stood on the milk crate, pulled out the knife\\
460 - and stabbed him several times\\
461 - with a downward motion like this.\\
462 - I may be fat, stupid,\\
463 - colorblind and dyslexic\\
464 - but at least I don't have three nipples.\\
465 - You shut your trap. That's a mole.\\
466 - And  you.\\
467 - Your family changed their name\\
468 - so you couldn't track them down.\\
469 - No one will miss you.\\
470 - I'm pretty sure it started with an "O."\\
471 - All three of you are useless, pea-brained idiots.\\
472 - And for your information,\\
473 - I do suffer more than everybody else.\\
474 - This is ridiculous.\\
475 - Let's just vote on it.\\
476 - Who votes for Francis?\\
477 - Who votes for Eric?\\
478 - Artie?\\
479 - Pete?\\
480 - Four votes, the hut has spoken.\\
481 - No, you tricked me.\\
482 - No, no...\\
483 - He'll reject me.\\
484 - I've tried me.\\
485 - I taste awful.\\
486 - All right,\\
487 - that's the worst thing any of us has ever done.\\
488 - I'm not proud of it,\\
489 - but I really don't think we had a choice.\\
490 - Like I care about your opinion on anything.\\
491 - Wait a minute.\\
492 - Why don't we hear eating?\\
493 - He got to the truck.\\
494 - Pete! Pete! Pete!\\
495 - See you back-stabbing sons of bitches in hell!\\
496 - So the witness saw Marty gassing up the motorcycle\\
497 - a half an hour after the owner said it went missing.\\
498 - But doesn't that gas station close at 5:00?\\
499 - Not on Fridays.\\
500 - She pointed that out in the transcript.\\
501 - Uh, I think we're ready for another vote.\\
502 - Lois?\\
503 - Go ahead.\\
504 - By a show of hands, who thinks the defendant is guilty?\\
505 - Great.\\
506 - Let's go tell the judge.\\
507 - Wait.\\
508 - I don't think Marty is guilty.\\
509 - What?\\
510 - I went through all these papers\\
511 - and it says the kid sings in a church choir.\\
512 - I just don't feel a churchgoing boy\\
513 - would do something like this.\\
514 - That is not fact. That's bias.\\
515 - You are basing a decision on feelings that have nothing to do\\
516 - with facts.\\
517 - Facts are things.\\
518 - Like witnesses seeing Marty steal the bike.\\
519 - Like Marty being apprehended while he was\\
520 - driving the stolen bike.\\
521 - Like Marty pulling\\
522 - tons of stupid stunts just like this one.\\
523 - Those are the facts.\\
524 - I just don't want to send that poor boy to jail.\\
525 - Oh, believe me, jail is going to do a lot more good\\
526 - than three years of military school ever did.\\
527 - Military school?\\
528 - I didn't read anything about military school.\\
529 - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
530 - I know I saw that somewhere.\\
531 - I don't think so.\\
532 - Didn't he drop out of vocational school?\\
533 - That's right, after he transferred from the private school\\
534 - where he got caught messing around with the teacher's aide.\\
535 - I-I... You don't understand.\\
536 - I know for a fact that Francis went...\\
537 - Who?\\
538 - Oh, my God.\\
539 - I think I have to excuse myself from this jury.\\
540 - All in favor.\\
541 - I'm trying to be the best me I can be.\\
542 - But I don't know what to say to girls\\
543 - so I just say something mean.\\
544 - I guess I'm afraid of getting hurt\\
545 - so I hurt them first.\\
546 - I think my problem is\\
547 - I get so frustrated over the things I can't control.\\
548 - I forget that they're people\\
549 - with their own will and their own needs.\\
550 - I play...\\
551 - mind games.\\
552 - It's all...\\
553 - I have.\\
554 - Why isn't there ever a flash flood when you need one?\\
555 - I really want a girlfriend.\\
556 - I want someone to hang out with.\\
557 - That's what I really want.\\
558 - Yeah, someone you can talk to.\\
559 - Someone...\\
560 - to hug.\\
561 - Someone to show my poetry to.\\
562 - You write...\\
563 - poetry?\\
564 - I dabble.\\
565 - What to you guys think about Brenda Pawlak?\\
566 - She's really nice.\\
567 - I think she'd be good for you.\\
568 - You'd make...\\
569 - a cute couple.\\
570 - I thought so, too.\\
571 - Hey, I know this sounds weird,\\
572 - but can I read you something I wrote?\\
573 - We'd love it.\\
574 - Hey.\\
575 - Hey.\\
576 - What happened?\\
577 - Did you read them your poetry?\\
578 - You guys couldn't even do this right.\\
579 - I really want to serve on another jury.\\
580 - I know, I messed up this time,\\
581 - but the next time I will do it right.\\
582 - I'm not responsible for scheduling that.\\
583 - I'm sure you have connections.\\
584 - Please, I just need another chance.\\
585 - Seems there was some kind of mistrial earlier.\\
586 - Now everything's backed up.\\
587 - You're going to have to wait.\\
588 - I'll do the best I can\\
589 - if you promise to stop bothering me right now.\\
590 - Deal.\\
591 - I got to go.\\
592 - My husband's probably going crazy without me.
\subsection {Episode 21: Cliques}
1 - Well, I agree, Mrs. Wiggins.\\
2 - These pastries are delightful.\\
3 - Hey, son. What you doing?\\
4 - I'm having a tea party with Mrs. Bear and the ladies.\\
5 - Ah, that's... good.\\
6 - Would you care to join us?\\
7 - Yeah, I have\\
8 - actually a-a... Hey, you know what?\\
9 - Why don't we go buy that Stealth Bomber model\\
10 - you've been asking for, huh?\\
11 - Okay.\\
12 - Okay.\\
13 - Sometimes it's just too easy.\\
14 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
15 -     I don't know    \\
16 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - Hey, you guys want to camp out\\
27 - in front of PC World tonight?\\
28 - The new Norton Antivirus comes out tomorrow.\\
29 - Your mom would let you?\\
30 - She's holding my place right now.\\
31 - Are you serious? What's the big deal?\\
32 - Sorry, Malcolm, but we have a life outside this place.\\
33 - How we doing, gentlemen?\\
34 - Everybody sticking to the experiment?\\
35 - Absolutely. Right on track, sir.\\
36 - I know how tempting it is\\
37 - to stray from a rigidly defined protocol.\\
38 - It's the siren's song of pure research,\\
39 - but you must resist her seductive powers because...\\
40 - "Unstable compounds require stable minds."\\
41 - Jackass.\\
42 - It's like he's talking to children.\\
43 - It was a perfectly legitimate variation.\\
44 - There was less than a 48% chance this would happen.\\
45 - Well, your cavalier disregard\\
46 - for the laws of the classroom--\\
47 - not to mention the laws of nature--\\
48 - have led to the inevitable.\\
49 - It will now take weeks\\
50 - to decontaminate that classroom.\\
51 - And during that time, you will all be placed\\
52 - back into the general population.\\
53 - We can't do that.\\
54 - The whole school hates us.\\
55 - They'll destroy us without realizing\\
56 - their rage is a projection of their own insecurities.\\
57 - And as for me, I've been offered a temporary position\\
58 - in the Phys Ed department\\
59 - where I will get to wear a whistle\\
60 - and dress in shorts.\\
61 - Of course, I'm sure none of this will be reflected\\
62 - in your end-of-year grades.\\
63 - Dewey, don't play connect the dots with your chicken pox.\\
64 - You'll get an infection.\\
65 - I'm bored! I know, sweetie.\\
66 - It's no fun being sick.\\
67 - I'm bored! I'm itchy!\\
68 - I'm bored!\\
69 - Honey, remember we were going to use our not-horrible voice?\\
70 - I'm bored!\\
71 - Well, then find something to do.\\
72 - Here.\\
73 - Play with these.\\
74 - I don't want to.\\
75 - Dewey, you are going to be contagious\\
76 - for the next six days.\\
77 - Do you want to spend them here like a good little boy\\
78 - or in the hospital?\\
79 - You don't go to the hospital for chick...\\
80 - Okay.\\
81 - Damn it!\\
82 - Maybe we could tack up a blanket.\\
83 - No, that's it. I'm going to tear the whole porch down\\
84 - and I'm going to build another one.\\
85 - Good luck getting permission from the Tribal Council.\\
86 - What? This part of the house is on tribal land,\\
87 - from the window all the way to the wolf picture.\\
88 - What are you talking about?\\
89 - The whole house used to be on the reservation,\\
90 - but my idiot grandfather built it on a glacier.\\
91 - It's been moving two inches a year ever since.\\
92 - In a hundred years, we'll have a nice view of the lake.\\
93 - Wow! So, part of this house\\
94 - is on an Indian reservation?\\
95 - Dealer has 20.\\
96 - Look at them.\\
97 - All they're thinking about is\\
98 - how many different places they'll dispose of my body.\\
99 - Hey, Ian, Eddie!\\
100 - How you doing?\\
101 - What are you doing?\\
102 - There's no more seats.\\
103 - There's a seat over there.\\
104 - Scoot over.\\
105 - Go sit down.\\
106 - You're going to get in trouble.\\
107 - Hey.\\
108 - Hey.\\
109 - 'Sup?\\
110 - 'Sup?\\
111 - God, it's so great to have a normal conversation.\\
112 - Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\\
113 - Is that from the new Ministry album?\\
114 - What?\\
115 - "Abandon All Hope."\\
116 - Is that from the new Ministry album?\\
117 - Actually, it's from Dante's Inferno.\\
118 - It's the inscription over the Gates of Hell.\\
119 - That is  way  dark.\\
120 - You should kick that guy's butt.\\
121 - Remember when I kicked his butt?\\
122 - No, he kicked  your  butt.\\
123 - You want me to kick your butt?\\
124 - Ah! Damn! Splinter!\\
125 - You are dead! You are dead!\\
126 - Don't pick! It'll get infected.\\
127 - What?\\
128 - You're making it worse. Let me get it out for you.\\
129 - You carry a first-aid kit with you?\\
130 - Just a crisis pouch.\\
131 - I leave the kit in my locker.\\
132 - There.\\
133 - Wow, that didn't hurt at all.\\
134 - Thanks.\\
135 - Hey, Dewey.\\
136 - Wow! Look at that!\\
137 - Is this helping take your mind off the itching?\\
138 - It was.\\
139 - Wow, you got a split, and you got a crossover.\\
140 - All those dominoes.\\
141 - All set up.\\
142 - Just ready to...\\
143 - Hey, check out Alicia.\\
144 - En fuego.\\
145 - Totally.\\
146 - Yeah, she's cute.\\
147 - Ah, check out Pam.\\
148 - Muy en fuego.\\
149 - Totally.\\
150 - Yeah, she's cute, too.\\
151 - Excuse me.\\
152 - And then...\\
153 - and it went like "Boing!"\\
154 - And then...\\
155 - I could download some of this...\\
156 - Hey, Stevie.\\
157 - So, it looks like everyone found a place.\\
158 - Parasites...\\
159 - adapting... to a new... host body.\\
160 - Except Herkabe, I guess.\\
161 - This sucks.\\
162 - We just heard the cleanup crew's going\\
163 - to put their dumpster where we skate.\\
164 - Where are we supposed to go?\\
165 - Why do they always have to pick on us?\\
166 - It's not like we destroyed a classroom.\\
167 - Damn... Krelboynes.\\
168 - I'll think... of something.\\
169 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
170 - Can you settle this?\\
171 - You know Stacy?\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - Is she en fuego or muy en fuego?\\
174 - Hard to say.\\
175 - My God!\\
176 - Dewey, look what you've built here!\\
177 - You have stairs and a ramp!\\
178 - You've spelled your name.\\
179 - Oh, so many, many dominoes.\\
180 - Where did they all come from?\\
181 - Mom got them from the Lippers.\\
182 - They got a whole crate the year Mr. Lipper was paralyzed.\\
183 - They even buried him with one of his dominoes.\\
184 - So this isn't really a complete set.\\
185 - Oh, no, Dewey. Don't scratch.\\
186 - But it's itchy. I know.\\
187 - But sometimes you just have to restrain yourself,\\
188 - even if you feel like ripping your eyes out of their sockets\\
189 - rather than go one more second without...\\
190 - scratching.\\
191 - Will you watch this for me?\\
192 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
193 - Okay, son.\\
194 - Reese!\\
195 - Don't even think about it!\\
196 - What's going on?\\
197 - He was about to knock down Dewey's dominoes.\\
198 - What?! Shame on you!\\
199 - I didn't do anything.\\
200 - And you're not going to. Ow!\\
201 - Those dominoes are keeping Dewey from driving me crazy,\\
202 - and if they get knocked over, I will blame you.\\
203 - If a door slams shut and knocks them over,\\
204 - I will blame you.\\
205 - If there is an earthquake, I will blame you.\\
206 - If a condor dies in flight and crashes through our roof\\
207 - and knocks them over, I will blame you.\\
208 - But that's not fair.\\
209 - I will blame you!\\
210 - Don't even think about it.\\
211 - What? I saw that look.\\
212 - What look? My look.\\
213 - Now I know where I got it from.\\
214 - I have no idea what you're talking about.\\
215 - I'm going to get a drink.\\
216 - Let's go.\\
217 - I can get it myself.\\
218 - It's all right.\\
219 - Man, I can't believe the school gave\\
220 - the Skaters our basketball court.\\
221 - Crazy.\\
222 - "Skater Safety Program"?\\
223 - Sounds suspicious.\\
224 - So what do we do?\\
225 - We kick their butts.\\
226 - Yeah.\\
227 - Guys, guys! There's an easier way.\\
228 - We'll take over the East Court.\\
229 - No, that's where the Goths hang out and smoke.\\
230 - Why don't you let me worry about the Goths.\\
231 - They can't take away our court.\\
232 - That's where I secondhand smoke!\\
233 - Some old lady who lives next door to the school\\
234 - complained we were scaring her.\\
235 - No, you weren't.\\
236 - Look at this handwriting.\\
237 - The loops, the girlish swirls.\\
238 - This is no old lady.\\
239 - It's Dabney.\\
240 - Well, where are we supposed to go now?\\
241 - What about the Posers' corner?\\
242 - You be trippin' if you think you're gonna stop us.\\
243 - You better bust a move 'cause this is our turf now!\\
244 - But we're in the middle of\\
245 - a very important Student Council meeting.\\
246 - That ain't no thang!\\
247 - The thang is 200 years of oppression in this country!\\
248 - What are you talking about?\\
249 - It's off the hook!\\
250 - Justice in the '02!\\
251 - You haven't heard the last of this.\\
252 - Sucka!\\
253 - Um, Kevin?\\
254 - You're supposed to wear underwear with those.\\
255 - Get out of here.\\
256 - Get out of here, man.\\
257 - Don't make me blow this!\\
258 - Do not make me blow this!\\
259 - Who removed my whistle pea?!\\
260 - That is a detentionable offense!\\
261 - It's awfully tempting, isn't it, Hal?\\
262 - Go ahead.\\
263 - I'll blame it on Reese.\\
264 - You'll get off scot-free.\\
265 - All right, pencils down!\\
266 - Turn in your geometry tests.\\
267 - But I didn't study!\\
268 - Turn around, old man.\\
269 - There's nothing for you here.\\
270 - I can't take this anymore.\\
271 - If I hear one more  "en fuego..."\\
272 - And six on top for the dealer.\\
273 - Whoops.\\
274 - Redeal.\\
275 - Hey! I had blackjack.\\
276 - You're cheating me out of my winnings.\\
277 - Come on, relax.\\
278 - I don't want any trouble.\\
279 - It's all in the tribe, right?\\
280 - Let's just calm down.\\
281 - I don't want to hear it.\\
282 - This is the same kind of thing your old man used to pull.\\
283 - He was nothing but a lying\\
284 - drunken jackass.\\
285 - Tell me something I don't know.\\
286 - Look, this was just a little misunderstanding.\\
287 - There, you got your chips back.\\
288 - See?\\
289 - We take care of our own here.\\
290 - Francis, maybe you shouldn't...\\
291 - Don't worry. I'll turn the fan back on once Ivan leaves.\\
292 - Dewey?\\
293 - I just spoke with the doctor.\\
294 - He says you can go back to school tomorrow.\\
295 - Okay.\\
296 - Tomorrow?\\
297 - So... so the dominoes...\\
298 - Go back in the crate tonight.\\
299 - Let me make this easy for you.\\
300 - I'm not leaving this house until I know you're at work.\\
301 - And I can wait all day.\\
302 - All I've got is school.\\
303 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
304 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
305 - I can't listen to you guys talk about who's totally hot,\\
306 - who's  en fuego.\\
307 - That stuff used to sound fine to me, but now it's just stupid.\\
308 - You guys are stupid.\\
309 - I don't mean that\\
310 - in an insulting way.\\
311 - I mean that in a factual way.\\
312 - You want to say "hot" in a different language?\\
313 - There are 700 different languages.\\
314 - Vary it a little.\\
315 - We just came to tell you that there's\\
316 - a fight going down at the schoolyard.\\
317 - Between who? Everybody.\\
318 - Oh, man!\\
319 - Hey, come on, dealer, let's go!\\
320 - And that's, uh, seven for the dealer.\\
321 - Piama.\\
322 - Where have you been? Shopping.\\
323 - You were supposed to relieve me.\\
324 - Do you have any idea what time it is?\\
325 - Now I do.\\
326 - Where did you get the money for all that stuff?\\
327 - I took 200 bucks from the stash.\\
328 - But that's all our money. We can't afford that.\\
329 - Well, you know, it's all in the tribe.\\
330 - Ha!\\
331 - Wha... Wha...\\
332 - What happened to the dominoes?\\
333 - I cleaned them up.\\
334 - You knocked them over without me?\\
335 - Why would I knock them over?\\
336 - I spent four days setting them up.\\
337 - What's going on?\\
338 - Why did you spend all of that money?\\
339 - Hey,\\
340 - you were the one talking about\\
341 - easing the suffering of our people.\\
342 - Well, I suffered a little less today.\\
343 - You don't just go and spend a bunch of money\\
344 - and not say anything.\\
345 - What's the problem?\\
346 - It's all in the tribe, right?\\
347 - That's what this is about?\\
348 - What, am I overstepping my bounds because I'm white?\\
349 - No, but it's...\\
350 - it feels weird.\\
351 - Look, we're married.\\
352 - That means I'm a part of your family and culture\\
353 - just like you're a part of mine.\\
354 - Believe me, if I had anything in my heritage\\
355 - besides crappy minivans and non-stop screaming,\\
356 - I'd share it with you.\\
357 - It's not the same!\\
358 - Oh, so because I'm not your people,\\
359 - I don't deserve any of that money?\\
360 - Why are you so obsessed about the money?!\\
361 - Because\\
362 - I want to pay off Lavernia\\
363 - so we can finally get out of here.\\
364 - What do you mean get out of here? We live here.\\
365 - What?\\
366 - You want to spend the rest of your life\\
367 - in this godforsaken place?\\
368 - This godforsaken place is where I grew up.\\
369 - It's our home.\\
370 - If you had a problem with living here,\\
371 - you should have said something.\\
372 - I have been complaining about this place\\
373 - since you've known me.\\
374 - I thought you were just a complainer.\\
375 - You complain about everything!\\
376 - Yeah, but this is real.\\
377 - I hate this place.\\
378 - I can't even imagine raising our kids here.\\
379 - Kids?!\\
380 - I hate kids!\\
381 - These seem like some pretty big issues.\\
382 - Yeah.\\
383 - You know, we got married so fast...\\
384 - So what are we going to do?\\
385 - And we both like wrestling movies.\\
386 - Yeah.\\
387 - And we both like pizza.\\
388 - I love pizza.\\
389 - Sausage and mushroom?\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - On half.\\
392 - We wait till the Jocks take out the Goths,\\
393 - and then we swoop in.\\
394 - I've made an alliance with the Drama Club.\\
395 - They've got swords.\\
396 - And when the Skaters see me drop my cape,\\
397 - they'll come in on the flank.\\
398 - No one will expect us to be working together.\\
399 - Are you sure this is a good idea?\\
400 - It's too late for second thoughts.\\
401 - The tribes have Balkanized.\\
402 - They don't like each other.\\
403 - Oh.\\
404 - We don't stop until we have total control.\\
405 - Deploy special shield!\\
406 - We're just right, we're okay.\\
407 - We're smarter now than yesterday.\\
408 - School is hard, but school is fun.\\
409 - 'Cause learning is for everyone!\\
410 - They got Darren. He bites.\\
411 - No!\\
412 - Stop!\\
413 - This has gone too far!\\
414 - Look what you've been reduced to.\\
415 - I'm helping!\\
416 - We all used to hate this school equally.\\
417 - We hated the teachers.\\
418 - We hated the administration.\\
419 - We hated the building.\\
420 - But now you've taken that perfectly good hate\\
421 - and turned it against each other.\\
422 - And why?\\
423 - Because people dress differently\\
424 - or talk differently?\\
425 - You're just making school even worse.\\
426 - Dabney was a Krelboyne\\
427 - two weeks ago, and now he's a Jock.\\
428 - That proves that these differences are meaningless.\\
429 - We need to focus on what makes us the same,\\
430 - because if we hate each other, who's going to hate school?\\
431 - You were a Krelboyne?\\
432 - Ha! You've got a Krelboyne.\\
433 - You guys got a Krelboyne right behind you.\\
434 - He's the one who wanted to fight in the first place.\\
435 - Hey, we got one, too!\\
436 - I found one!\\
437 - He's our leader!\\
438 - If it's any consolation,\\
439 - we get our new classroom in five weeks.\\
440 - Thanks for the heads up on the underwear.\\
441 - No problem.\\
442 - What is with the self-pity?\\
443 - Albert Einstein had to carry spare pants until he was 24.\\
444 - And did he cry about it? No.\\
445 - He drew on that experience\\
446 - and helped build the first nuclear bomb.\\
447 - Now, buck up\\
448 - and get in the van.\\
449 - Oh, video camera.\\
450 - Oh...
\subsection {Episode 22: Monkey}
1 - In order to break free of the earth's atmosphere,\\
2 - a rocket ship must attain speeds\\
3 - of upwards of 25,000 miles per hour.\\
4 - Bull. If they went that fast,\\
5 - they would just be squashed in the back of their seats.\\
6 - They wouldn't float around.\\
7 - You're confusing acceleration with velocity.\\
8 - You feel it when you first start going faster,\\
9 - but once you're up to speed, you don't even notice.\\
10 - I mean, right now we're on a planet\\
11 - that's spinning at a thousand miles per hour,\\
12 - and that's just rotational velocity.\\
13 - We're also traveling around the sun at almost 67,000\\
14 - miles per hour, and then\\
15 - the whole solar system is hurtling through the galaxy,\\
16 - which is hurtling away from all the other galaxies\\
17 - because the universe is expanding.\\
18 - Whee!\\
19 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
20 -     I don't know    \\
21 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     And you're not so big    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
29 -     And you're not so big    \\
30 -     Life is unfair.    \\
31 - Did you hear that?\\
32 - Firing retro-jets, Captain.\\
33 - Hal, I think somebody's trying\\
34 - to break into our house.\\
35 - I'll do it in the morning.\\
36 - What was that?\\
37 - Oh, my God! Hal!\\
38 - I'll get 'em, Lois.\\
39 - Got him!\\
40 - What would have happened\\
41 - if Reese didn't knock him out?\\
42 - He would have seen our TV and stereo\\
43 - and known he'd made a terrible mistake.\\
44 - Now let go of my arm.\\
45 - He came through the window\\
46 - right in front of us.\\
47 - I-I can't explain it.\\
48 - It was like, it was like we were paralyzed,\\
49 - and then my son Reese came in,\\
50 - swinging this bat.\\
51 - He saved us all.\\
52 - Yeah, it's a good thing\\
53 - Reese got to him before I did.\\
54 - And where were you, sir?\\
55 - I was in bed.\\
56 - Actually, trapped in bed.\\
57 - You see, my wife insists on tucking in the corners--\\
58 - I mean, really tucking them in.\\
59 - I saw his head in the moonlight.\\
60 - It looked like a big, fat pitch\\
61 - sitting over the plate.\\
62 - If only there were more kids like you,\\
63 - our streets would be a lot safer.\\
64 - Thanks.\\
65 - You look familiar.\\
66 - Did you ever participate in our ride-along program?\\
67 - Sort of.\\
68 - It's like being in a straitjacket.\\
69 - You twist and you twist\\
70 - and you just can't shake the damn sheets loose.\\
71 - Well, the most important thing is, we caught the guy.\\
72 - You know what? Why don't I show you?\\
73 - Follow me to the bedroom and I'll tuck you in. You'll...\\
74 - Sir! You don't tuck in police officers.\\
75 - Craig! I got your lunch!\\
76 - Sorry I'm late.\\
77 - Picked up your burgers and I had to drive a half an hour\\
78 - across town to get your chicken from Nugget World.\\
79 - I thought you said you wanted to help me lead a normal life.\\
80 - Did you get the extra mayo?\\
81 - Yes.\\
82 - From which place?\\
83 - When are you getting the nurse?\\
84 - Well, gee, Lois, it's just that I've been so busy\\
85 - with, you know, having my arms and legs broken\\
86 - when your kids' dog chased me out into traffic.\\
87 - Plus, I can't sleep knowing the mental trauma\\
88 - my cat suffers staying at Mother's.\\
89 - Then there's all the forehead sticks\\
90 - I went through learning to go to the bathroom.\\
91 - Craig, the insurance company gave you money for a nurse.\\
92 - Ah, Lois, poor, sweet, money-wasting Lois.\\
93 - I've got something better.\\
94 - Oliver!\\
95 - Oh, my God, is that a monkey?\\
96 - It's a helper monkey.\\
97 - They're highly trained and they donate them free\\
98 - to the permanently disabled.\\
99 - You're not permanently disabled.\\
100 - For the next six weeks, he thinks I am.\\
101 - Craig, I am not taking care\\
102 - of you and a wild animal.\\
103 - Lois, it's not a wild animal.\\
104 - It's a capuchin monkey.\\
105 - They're nature's butlers.\\
106 - I got a good one, too.\\
107 - His brother worked for Stephen Hawking.\\
108 - My God, when was the last time this thing was cleaned?\\
109 - This is the worst job in the world.\\
110 - Why do we put up with this?\\
111 - I don't know about you, but I'm still paying off law school.\\
112 - Okay, everybody!\\
113 - Clear out. You're all fired.\\
114 - What? Camp's closing.\\
115 - They cut down the last tree today.\\
116 - Anyone want to take a picture with it?\\
117 - A mining company bought the land.\\
118 - You got to be out of here by the end of today.\\
119 - We're just out like that without notice?\\
120 - This is the circle of life up here.\\
121 - First they cut down the trees.\\
122 - Then the mining company strips the land.\\
123 - Then, with any luck at all, they turn whatever's left\\
124 - into a nuclear waste dump.\\
125 - It's the only way we're going to wean ourselves\\
126 - from our unhealthy dependence on foreign oil.\\
127 - Well, I guess I'm going to have to move\\
128 - back in with my parents.\\
129 - And then, after the awards ceremony\\
130 - they gave me a tour of the police station.\\
131 - Did you know that the mirrors\\
132 - in the interrogation room are two-way?\\
133 - It's a good thing they didn't have that before.\\
134 - "For heroism and meritorious action."\\
135 - Reese, I'm so proud of you.\\
136 - Okay, Dewey, are you finally\\
137 - going to be able to go to sleep now?\\
138 - You saw all the policemen and how strong the bars are.\\
139 - Yeah, but...\\
140 - And you saw that the police station\\
141 - is much too big for a helicopter to carry it away\\
142 - to a secret hideout under the sea.\\
143 - But... No buts, Dewey.\\
144 - That guy is in a jail cell.\\
145 - He's not going anywhere.\\
146 - I wouldn't bet on it.\\
147 - With our legal system\\
148 - he's probably back on the streets right now.\\
149 - Dewey.\\
150 - Mom, Dad,\\
151 - this whole thing's got me thinking.\\
152 - I mean, usually those cops\\
153 - are throwing me in the back of their squad cars,\\
154 - but today they were all clapping for me.\\
155 - Well, you're a real hero.\\
156 - And it was really cool, you know, protecting you guys,\\
157 - saving your lives.\\
158 - Thanks again.\\
159 - And it's made me realize\\
160 - for the first time in my life,\\
161 - I know what my purpose is.\\
162 - I think I've found my calling.\\
163 - Mom, Dad...\\
164 - I want to be a pig.\\
165 - Go to sleep.\\
166 - I'm still scared.\\
167 - Read me a story. Please.\\
168 - I've already read you every book in this place.\\
169 - Please.\\
170 - "Aardvark. A burrowing mammal of Southern Africa."\\
171 - "Myocardium. The muscle tissue of the heart."\\
172 - It's all right. It's all right.\\
173 - It was just me turning off the light.\\
174 - Where are you?!\\
175 - Sorry.\\
176 - Go back to sleep.\\
177 - "Commingle."\\
178 - It turns out it was all a simple misunderstanding.\\
179 - It's Larry who should have gotten the spin-off show,\\
180 - not the Ropers, huh, Oliver?\\
181 - Oh, Lois, you're not drinking your tea.\\
182 - Oliver, Lois takes sugar in her tea.\\
183 - One lump.\\
184 - I usually like to thank him when he does something right.\\
185 - Um, thank you, Oliver.\\
186 - Isn't he amazing?\\
187 - He makes the bed, he does dishes.\\
188 - He even changes his own diaper.\\
189 - Oliver, temple massage.\\
190 - Oh...\\
191 - This is about as good as it gets.\\
192 - Lois, you want some of this?\\
193 - I have to go.\\
194 - Oh, you're like a furry little geisha.\\
195 - Hey, what's going on here?\\
196 - We're just playing.\\
197 - It's getting a little loud.\\
198 - This is a nice neighborhood.\\
199 - Let's keep it that way.\\
200 - Stay in school.\\
201 - Hey, you kids! Wear your helmets!\\
202 - That's not safe!\\
203 - Who the hell are you?\\
204 - Ouch! Ow!\\
205 - See? You should be more careful.\\
206 - Play safe. Be smart.\\
207 - Did you get the job?\\
208 - No. It was a stupid idea anyway,\\
209 - auditioning for a cruise ship.\\
210 - And what kind of a piano player\\
211 - doesn't know the music to Cabaret?\\
212 - Honey, this is useless.\\
213 - We have to go someplace where there's work!\\
214 - We're not leaving our home.\\
215 - Something will come up.\\
216 - We're not here. What?\\
217 - Piama! I know you're in there!\\
218 - Hey, what's the problem?\\
219 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
220 - We served your eviction notice 30 days ago.\\
221 - You have to leave.\\
222 - Eviction? What are you talking about?\\
223 - Why didn't you tell me?\\
224 - Because it's not happening.\\
225 - Hey, the tribal council made a deal with the mining company.\\
226 - You're getting a settlement.\\
227 - Part of a settlement.\\
228 - Only one-fifteenth of your property's on tribal land.\\
229 - Forget it!\\
230 - We'll just live in the other part of the house.\\
231 - You can't do that.\\
232 - This whole area's been designated\\
233 - as an arsenic containment basin.\\
234 - Nobody's stealing my property.\\
235 - Let's just all cool down.\\
236 - Uh, you may actually not want to touch her.\\
237 - Don't tell me how to do my job.\\
238 - All right, missy,\\
239 - let's get one thing straight.\\
240 - What time is it?\\
241 - Oh, damn!\\
242 - It's too dark to see my Rolex.\\
243 - No matter.\\
244 - I'll just take out the maximum amount,\\
245 - and everything will be fine.\\
246 - Yeah, that ought to do it.\\
247 - Now, where did I park my Bentley?\\
248 - Damn my inability to see in the dark.\\
249 - Hey!\\
250 - Can I help you with something?\\
251 - Your money's hanging out of your pocket.\\
252 - You might want to tuck it back in.\\
253 - This is a bad neighborhood.\\
254 - Thank you.\\
255 - Ooh, that lasagna smells good.\\
256 - Took you long enough, though.\\
257 - What, did you have to fly to Italy to get it?\\
258 - Never mind.\\
259 - Let's, uh, let's dig in.\\
260 - Oh! Oh!\\
261 - Hot, hot, hot.\\
262 - Let-Let's just let it cool down a little bit.\\
263 - Oh! Hot! Tongue!\\
264 - Blisters! Please, God, no! Water!\\
265 - Water. Good monkey.\\
266 - Closer. Closer.\\
267 - Aah! Hot!\\
268 - Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!\\
269 - You're out.\\
270 - I was safe.\\
271 - Out. Safe.\\
272 - Looks like someone smashed up\\
273 - your trash cans pretty good.\\
274 - Maybe if you brought them in on time,\\
275 - this kind of thing wouldn't happen.\\
276 - Oliver!\\
277 - Is my milkshake ready?\\
278 - It was supposed to be ready an hour ago!\\
279 - If it's warm, you can go ahead and drink it\\
280 - 'cause I won't.\\
281 - All right, I will.\\
282 - Where is it?\\
283 - Oliver?\\
284 - You know what, I've changed my mind.\\
285 - I'm not in the mood for a milkshake anymore.\\
286 - Well, since you did go to all that trouble.\\
287 - Mmm, good.\\
288 - Well, I've been awake for a week straight.\\
289 - First 96 hours were tough,\\
290 - but I really think I'm starting to get my second wind.\\
291 - Who needs sleep anyway?\\
292 - Just a waste of time.\\
293 - They say that Thomas Edison-- he only got, like...\\
294 - Well, he didn't...\\
295 - What was I talking about?\\
296 - Never mind.\\
297 - Craig, I can't stay long.\\
298 - I got your mail.\\
299 - Geez, it's boiling in here.\\
300 - Really? I hadn't noticed anything.\\
301 - I was just\\
302 - spending a pleasant afternoon at home\\
303 - here with Oliver.\\
304 - Lois, that monkey is out to get me.\\
305 - What? He tried to poison me\\
306 - and now he's trying to cook me alive.\\
307 - He is an evil little monkey.\\
308 - Craig, you're asking an animal with a brain the size\\
309 - of a piece of gum to run your household.\\
310 - Stop being paranoid.\\
311 - I am not being paranoid.\\
312 - I've seen him staring\\
313 - at me when I'm pretending to be asleep.\\
314 - He's been chewing on my brake cables.\\
315 - You have got to get me out of here.\\
316 - You are not staying with me.\\
317 - Craig...\\
318 - that monkey is not...\\
319 - Lois, you tell such amusing stories. Shh.\\
320 - You are getting a real nurse tomorrow.\\
321 - Just a quart of milk?\\
322 - That's it.\\
323 - What are you doing?\\
324 - I was waiting for that spot!\\
325 - Oh, you got a problem with me, pal?\\
326 - Oh, bring it on.\\
327 - Well, you want it? You got it.\\
328 - I'll kick your ass.\\
329 - You think I'm afraid of you?\\
330 - I am not afraid!\\
331 - No one's tucked in now!\\
332 - Just give me 30 seconds.\\
333 - I'll beat you like I was your daddy.\\
334 - I am going to pound your head\\
335 - out through your butt, and then\\
336 - I'm going to make you kiss it.\\
337 - I am very sorry, sir.\\
338 - Oh, yeah, yeah, you're going to be sorry.\\
339 - Hey, hey, where are you going?\\
340 - What, are you going to run away, little girl?\\
341 - Why don't you come out here\\
342 - and fight like a man?\\
343 - Hey, Mom, what are you doing?\\
344 - Unloading the groceries.\\
345 - You're, uh, a little far on the sidewalk, aren't you?\\
346 - Who cares? Grab a bag.\\
347 - You have to leave the sidewalk free for pedestrians.\\
348 - Stop stalling and help unload.\\
349 - Are you walking away from me?\\
350 - Excuse me?\\
351 - You can't leave your car here.\\
352 - I will leave my car wherever I want to leave my car.\\
353 - Well, I'd hate to see\\
354 - anything happen to your car.\\
355 - Just bring in the bags, Reese.\\
356 - Officer in need of assistance!\\
357 - Repeat: Officer in need of assistance!\\
358 - 911 emergency.\\
359 - This is Craig Feldspar.\\
360 - You've got to help me.\\
361 - My monkey butler is trying to kill me.\\
362 - I don't know how much time I have...\\
363 - That lawyer was a total idiot.\\
364 - Are you kidding?\\
365 - A $50 fine was a great deal.\\
366 - It probably costs\\
367 - ten times that amount to wire that deputy's jaw shut.\\
368 - He totally deserved what happened.\\
369 - This is not helping us.\\
370 - Look, here's the settlement check from the tribe.\\
371 - We can use it to pay your fine.\\
372 - I'm not taking a settlement\\
373 - and I'm not paying the fine.\\
374 - I'm getting a real lawyer\\
375 - and taking this to trial.\\
376 - That would take four or five months.\\
377 - There is a bulldozer in the yard\\
378 - and it is going to flatten this house\\
379 - whether we're in it or not!\\
380 - I'm not scared of a bulldozer.\\
381 - You know what? The bulldozer doesn't care\\
382 - if you're scared or not.\\
383 - It will still crush you.\\
384 - We have to get out of here.\\
385 - I can't.\\
386 - Why are you so scared to leave?\\
387 - I don't know.\\
388 - Francis, I've been on this reservation\\
389 - my whole life.\\
390 - I don't know anything else.\\
391 - I'm just a hick.\\
392 - I'm not like you.\\
393 - I can't just pick up\\
394 - and start a new life whenever I need to.\\
395 - I'm not as brave as you, okay?\\
396 - Brave?\\
397 - I'm not brave. I just didn't know any better.\\
398 - What?\\
399 - If I had had any idea of how horrible it was up here,\\
400 - I never would have come.\\
401 - And I never would have met you.\\
402 - I'm not brave, I'm just stupid and lucky.\\
403 - And you're with me now,\\
404 - so my stupid luck will take care of you.\\
405 - Hopefully, one-fifteenth of a share will pay off our fine\\
406 - and maybe buy us a bus ticket.\\
407 - Oh, my God.\\
408 - What?\\
409 - Oh, my God.\\
410 - That's more than I made all last year.\\
411 - See, this is what I'm talking about.\\
412 - Craig, you in there?\\
413 - Craig? What happened?\\
414 - Behind you.\\
415 - What the hell's wrong with that monkey?\\
416 - He's crazy.\\
417 - Well, he picked the wrong guy to mess with.\\
418 - Oh, no!\\
419 - God, please, no!\\
420 - Hang on, Craig.\\
421 - No, leave me. Save yourself.\\
422 - I am not going\\
423 - to leave you here, buddy.\\
424 - You'll be safe here.\\
425 - Not my Romulans.\\
426 - Oh!\\
427 - Oof!\\
428 - I always pictured an ending like this.\\
429 - Take that, you damn, dirty helper monkey!\\
430 - So, where do you want to go?\\
431 - I don't care.\\
432 - All I know is we've got $2,000 left\\
433 - and a car pointed south.\\
434 - Read it to me again, Dad.\\
435 - Okay, son.\\
436 - "Local man subdues monkey.\\
437 - "A disabled man was saved by a local hero\\
438 - when he was..."\\
439 - Oh...\\
440 - I can't believe it.\\
441 - Dewey's finally fallen asleep.\\
442 - I'm only 11 hours away from the world record.\\
443 - So, at least some good will come of...\\
444 - "Experts say the capuchin monkey can weigh up to nine pounds.\\
445 - 'He's a real hero,' said victim Craig Feldspar, age 36."\\
446 - "A real hero."

\subsection {Episode 01: Zoo}
1 - Malcolm! Reese!\\
2 - No playing ball in the house!\\
3 - No playing ball on the house!\\
4 - No playing ball through the house!\\
5 - This isn't even fun.\\
6 - That stopped being the point a long time ago.\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Oh, for God's sake, Malcolm.\\
20 - This is the last time I'm going to tell you.\\
21 - Get up right now!\\
22 - I'll get up when the world stops being a cruel joke,\\
23 - which is never!\\
24 - Malcolm,\\
25 - you smell like a locker room.\\
26 - This has got to stop.\\
27 - You've wasted your entire summer\\
28 - lying in bed feeling sorry for yourself.\\
29 - Your father thinks we sent you away to camp.\\
30 - You're right. I'm a pathetic loser.\\
31 - Honey...\\
32 - this is just a phase.\\
33 - Every teenager goes through it.\\
34 - I did, your father did.\\
35 - Francis cried in the shower every day for six months.\\
36 - Reese wouldn't get out of the dryer.\\
37 - It's awkward and it's painful\\
38 - and you think it's never going to end.\\
39 - Now get out of bed! We're going to the zoo.\\
40 - Why are we going to go stare\\
41 - at a bunch of pathetic, caged animals\\
42 - and fat, suburban yahoos pointing and laughing at them?\\
43 - Because I have a coupon.\\
44 - Is the zoo one of the places where you have\\
45 - to be this tall to do the good stuff?\\
46 - I don't know.\\
47 - I've never been there when it's open.\\
48 - This is going to be so much fun.\\
49 - I'm so glad I ran into Matt.\\
50 - Yeah, that was quite a lucky break.\\
51 - Good old, good old Matt.\\
52 - It has been 20 years since I was dating the both of you.\\
53 - I can't believe you're still jealous.\\
54 - I am not jealous.\\
55 - I'm not even the jealous type.\\
56 - I was just trying to read the meter!\\
57 - Not in those shorts, Tarzan!\\
58 - Why don't you just marry Tom Cruise?!\\
59 - Okay, that's enough. Break it up.\\
60 - Hello.\\
61 - Hi, Dad.\\
62 - Francis!\\
63 - How's it going?\\
64 - Couldn't be going better, Dad.\\
65 - We're seeing the country, meeting great people.\\
66 - This is the best time of our lives.\\
67 - Well...\\
68 - I guess your mom and I were really wrong\\
69 - about your cross-country plan.\\
70 - We thought it would be a disaster.\\
71 - I'm not going to rub your face in it, Dad.\\
72 - We're having too much fun!\\
73 - No, thanks, Joe,\\
74 - I couldn't take another bite of pie.\\
75 - This trip has been so good for us.\\
76 - We have seen so many things.\\
77 - Majestic mountains, quiet little towns,\\
78 - emergency opportunities for charitable giving...\\
79 - That's great.\\
80 - It sounds like you are really making it out there.\\
81 - Yeah, so, about these charitable...\\
82 - Listen, we're on our way to the zoo right now,\\
83 - but you call us back next week, okay?\\
84 - Love to Piama.\\
85 - Oh, look how nice this is.\\
86 - And it's such a beautiful day.\\
87 - You have to stop making that noise.\\
88 - Fine, Mom, I won't breathe.\\
89 - You know, son, I hate to see you like this.\\
90 - I tell you what. Why don't we get you a wax crocodile?\\
91 - Can we see the tigers?\\
92 - I'm going to go hit the monkeys.\\
93 - I mean, go see the monkeys.\\
94 - Look, Matt's Animals of the Rain Forest show\\
95 - starts in 20 minutes.\\
96 - Gee, don't want to miss that.\\
97 - Can I just go wait in the car?\\
98 - I mean, it's technically at the zoo.\\
99 - No. And since you're so committed to being miserable,\\
100 - you can be in charge of your little brother for the day.\\
101 - No. Great. Let's look\\
102 - at every animal first,\\
103 - then decide which ones we want to go back to.\\
104 - Meet back here at 5:00!\\
105 - Let go of me. I don't want to be your baby-sitter.\\
106 - I just want to be by myself.\\
107 - Are you mad?\\
108 - I'm not mad.\\
109 - You sound mad.\\
110 - Fine, I'm mad!\\
111 - Who are you mad at?\\
112 - I'm not mad!\\
113 - Look, you wouldn't understand.\\
114 - Yes, I would. No, you wouldn't.\\
115 - You're still living in your kiddie dream world.\\
116 - You don't realize you're nothing\\
117 - but an insignificant speck of dust\\
118 - lost in an uncaring universe full of random tragedy.\\
119 - What's a lemur?\\
120 - Oh, look, there's Matt. Hi, Matt!\\
121 - Lo-lo!\\
122 - Hi!\\
123 - Hey, Matt.\\
124 - Quite a zoo you got here.\\
125 - I got to tell you,\\
126 - this is an exciting day for us.\\
127 - We don't often get a chance to spend time with the family.\\
128 - You know how it is-- work, work, work!\\
129 - But to tell you the truth, it's mostly my boss.\\
130 - He gets off on cracking the whip.\\
131 - You know, he's a real bastard.\\
132 - But I got a feeling\\
133 - that he's about to get the axe.\\
134 - At least that's what Jimbo in marketing says.\\
135 - So good to see you, Matt. Yeah.\\
136 - I knew you'd end up doing something like this.\\
137 - You always had all those cute animals.\\
138 - Well, you didn't think Monty was so cute.\\
139 - I hated that snake!\\
140 - Remember the time I found him in the shower?\\
141 - Hey, are your kids here?\\
142 - I'd love to meet them.\\
143 - Oh, yeah, yeah, they're around.\\
144 - You'll recognize them.\\
145 - They all look like me.\\
146 - So, who's this little guy, huh?\\
147 - Do you want this?\\
148 - Too slow.\\
149 - Hey, watch where you're going.\\
150 - Big mistake, pal!\\
151 - You want to go? We'll go.\\
152 - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?\\
153 - He started it.\\
154 - Goats don't start it.\\
155 - Get out.\\
156 - Guess what I get to do.\\
157 - Leave.\\
158 - If we push the car till we find a mechanic,\\
159 - we can pay with aluminum cans...\\
160 - Francis, we've been pushing the car for two days.\\
161 - I'm tired and I'm hungry.\\
162 - I'm going to buy something to eat.\\
163 - No, no, no! Get lottery tickets.\\
164 - This is exactly the kind of time\\
165 - when these things pay off.\\
166 - Honey, we're not spending our last five dollars\\
167 - on lottery tickets. That's crazy.\\
168 - Now I'm going in there and I'm buying food.  Food.\\
169 - Like adults eat.\\
170 - No wonder you were $3,000 under blue book.\\
171 - Cadillac? Yeah. 1974?\\
172 - If you say so.\\
173 - She is a beauty!\\
174 - I love your American cars.\\
175 - BMW could learn a thing or two\\
176 - but no, everything has to be about perfect engineering.\\
177 - Otto, what are you doing?\\
178 - Who is this handsome boy?\\
179 - Hi, I'm Francis.\\
180 - I am talking cars with my new American friend.\\
181 - And yes, he is very handsome.\\
182 - So, Francis, you also come to the Circle K\\
183 - for the wonderful hot dogs?\\
184 - Actually, we were just sort of passing through\\
185 - and our car broke down.\\
186 - This is so lucky for you.\\
187 - This is a wonderful place.\\
188 - We own a dude ranch just nearby\\
189 - with cows and horses and people.\\
190 - We don't own the people.\\
191 - We call it "The Grotto."\\
192 - She is Gretchen, I am Otto-- Grotto.\\
193 - You should come and visit, eh?\\
194 - Oh, thanks, but\\
195 - I'm out of work and we're kind of broke right now.\\
196 - Wait!\\
197 - I am having a thought!\\
198 - Eh, it's gone.\\
199 - He could work for us at the ranch.\\
200 - That was my thought!\\
201 - We need a ranch foreman.\\
202 - Wait. I don't know the first thing about ranching.\\
203 - Ah, you will learn.\\
204 - I can tell you are clever.\\
205 - Really, I've never...\\
206 - Look me in the eye.\\
207 - Yeah, I can tell. It is the job for you.\\
208 - Pays $200 a week plus free room and board.\\
209 - Done.\\
210 - I have one question.\\
211 - Yeah?\\
212 - This isn't going to end up\\
213 - with me cut up into little pieces\\
214 - and buried in a secret basement, is it?\\
215 - Nope.\\
216 - You got a deal.\\
217 - Okay, I got lottery tickets.\\
218 - We don't need 'em.\\
219 - Go away!\\
220 - Get out of here!\\
221 - I'm warning you.\\
222 - I'm not falling for your goat mind games.\\
223 - If nothing I do ever has any meaning,\\
224 - then I can't care about anything,\\
225 - which makes me feel even worse.\\
226 - How am I supposed to ever feel happy?\\
227 - Kid, I'm a zoo clown.\\
228 - Now buy a giraffe or go to hell.\\
229 - See, Dewey, there's a guy who understands.\\
230 - Malcolm, you're at the zoo.\\
231 - You have a Popsicle.\\
232 - How can you be unhappy?\\
233 - I wanted grape.\\
234 - Tigers!\\
235 - Where are they? They're not here.\\
236 - What a gyp!\\
237 - See, that's what I mean.\\
238 - The one thing you were excited about, closed.\\
239 - Maybe they're down here.\\
240 - Or maybe there never were any tigers\\
241 - and they just put up the signs\\
242 - to build a sense of disappointment...\\
243 - Dewey!\\
244 - I'm okay.\\
245 - You idiot,\\
246 - what the hell's wrong with you?\\
247 - Come on.\\
248 - Let's get out of here before we get caught.\\
249 - Okay, Cookie, it's payday.\\
250 - Oh, that must happen a lot in the rain forest.\\
251 - Okay, if I could have another volunteer.\\
252 - He was pointing at me.\\
253 - Oh, uh... okay.\\
254 - Uh...\\
255 - Could you tell everyone your name, sir?\\
256 - I'm Hal. Lois's husband.\\
257 - Well, Hal, are you feeling adventurous?\\
258 - Would you like to meet another friend from the rain forest?\\
259 - Ooh, I don't know.\\
260 - Animals that can withstand rain...\\
261 - Well, we better hurry, because the needless destruction\\
262 - of the rain forest is going on at an alarming rate.\\
263 - It's threatening thousands of helpless species each year\\
264 - like... the beautiful and gentle\\
265 - bird-eating tarantula.\\
266 - Now I know Victor looks dangerous,\\
267 - but the tarantula is actually a very gentle\\
268 - and timid creature.\\
269 - I am so sorry.\\
270 - Victor's never done anything like that before.\\
271 - Once the swelling goes down, the fangs should fall out.\\
272 - This is where you will stay.\\
273 - It's a guest cabin,\\
274 - but you can do whatever you want to make it feel homey.\\
275 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
276 - Move your furniture, put up pictures.\\
277 - If you want to hammer a sandwich to the wall,\\
278 - you can do it.\\
279 - So, Francis, tell me,\\
280 - you like horses?\\
281 - I honestly have no idea.\\
282 - I love horses.\\
283 - Their bodies are so big and their feet are so tiny,\\
284 - they make me laugh.\\
285 - This is just\\
286 - so generous and nice of you.\\
287 - This place is so beautiful.\\
288 - I never want to leave.\\
289 - Oh, this is what happened to Otto.\\
290 - We were on vacation and Otto was so happy\\
291 - to be away from\\
292 - the stress of running the factory.\\
293 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
294 - 25 heart-lung machines per day,\\
295 - and if you make one teeny little mistake,\\
296 - boy, do you hear about it.\\
297 - Don't move, don't move, don't move...\\
298 - You've been saying that for 20 minutes.\\
299 - I still mean it.\\
300 - Do you think he's mad?\\
301 - I don't know.\\
302 - I don't think it matters.\\
303 - Just stay quiet and try not to look like meat.\\
304 - Hey, I don't think you kids\\
305 - are supposed to be messing around down there.\\
306 - Yeah, thank you.\\
307 - Would you mind going to tell somebody\\
308 - that we're down here, please?\\
309 - Oh, for the love of God.\\
310 - I don't think those kids are supposed to be down there.\\
311 - Get us out of here!\\
312 - Okay, okay...\\
313 - calm down.\\
314 - We train for situations like this,\\
315 - and there are standard procedures we follow.\\
316 - What's the limit on our liability?\\
317 - No, the press release has to sound sympathetic to the boys.\\
318 - But make it clear it's their fault.\\
319 - No, I gave you back the key to the rifle closet.\\
320 - Oh, yes I did!\\
321 - Hey, you folks see the koalas?\\
322 - Okay, let's take a look.\\
323 - How is it?\\
324 - It's much better.\\
325 - It stopped weeping.\\
326 - Someone wants to say he's sorry.\\
327 - Apology accepted.\\
328 - Okay, I'm going to go take another look for the boys.\\
329 - Why don't you just rest?\\
330 - Hal, I don't know what to say.\\
331 - I just feel awful about what happened.\\
332 - Do you really?\\
333 - Of course I do.\\
334 - Come on, man, I think we both know\\
335 - that you've been holding a grudge\\
336 - because Lois chose me over you.\\
337 - Lois chose...\\
338 - Wait a minute.\\
339 - Is that what you think?\\
340 - I just hope this makes us even,\\
341 - because I can't feel my feet and you're kind of upside-down.\\
342 - Hal, you've got it all wrong.\\
343 - I wasn't angry at you.\\
344 - The whole situation was just too much for me,\\
345 - so I backed off.\\
346 - What?\\
347 - I mean, Lois is great,\\
348 - but I wanted to be exclusive and she didn't.\\
349 - On any given weekend,\\
350 - I didn't know if she was with you or me or Dennis...\\
351 - Dennis? Who's Dennis?\\
352 - No one.\\
353 - I got to go.\\
354 - 20 minutes ago, I was worried about which one of us\\
355 - was going to be eaten by a tiger.\\
356 - Now I can relax.\\
357 - Okay, kids, the tigers didn't go for the steaks we threw down.\\
358 - The problem is\\
359 - they're attracted to you because you're alive,\\
360 - like their natural prey.\\
361 - There's a "but" coming, right?\\
362 - Well, no.\\
363 - But we have things under control.\\
364 - We're going to fire tranquilizer darts at the tigers.\\
365 - How long do they take to work?\\
366 - Less than two minutes.\\
367 - So, the plan is\\
368 - to piss them off and keep them awake\\
369 - just long enough so they can take it out on us?\\
370 - Hold on a sec.\\
371 - Okay, these people are idiots.\\
372 - Malcolm, it'll be okay.\\
373 - Yeah, Dewey, I hope so, too, but...\\
374 - I'm not hoping.\\
375 - I  know  it'll be fine.\\
376 - You can't know that.\\
377 - Yes, I can.\\
378 - No, you can't.\\
379 - Yes, I can.\\
380 - I do. I know we'll be fine.\\
381 - Okay, just sit tight a few more minutes.\\
382 - Apparently they had a similar situation in D.C.,\\
383 - and we're trying to find out exactly what went wrong there.\\
384 - But the main thing is everything's going to be okay.\\
385 - See?\\
386 - Sorry. Excuse me.\\
387 - Excuse me, I need to get through.\\
388 - I'm looking for my kids.\\
389 - There's no kids here, that's for sure.\\
390 - Lois? Hal?\\
391 - What are you doing here? You should be lying down.\\
392 - Yes, I should, but then I had a conversation with Matt\\
393 - who informed me that there was another guy you were dating\\
394 - while you were dating us.\\
395 - Oh, my God.\\
396 - Oh, my God... Hal...\\
397 - Hal, I'm sorry.\\
398 - I... I meant to tell you.\\
399 - I-I should have told you.\\
400 - I just-- I could never find the right time,\\
401 - and I was never that serious about Larry anyway.\\
402 - Who the hell is Larry?\\
403 - I'm talking about Dennis!\\
404 - Dennis, right, that's who I meant.\\
405 - Oh, my God, who are you?\\
406 - Hal, please... can we discuss this tonight?\\
407 - Well, I don't know, Lois.\\
408 - Maybe you have a date.\\
409 - Okay, in the first place, this was all over 20 years ago.\\
410 - And second, it doesn't matter because I love you.\\
411 - And third, you were the one dating that slut manicurist!\\
412 - Here is where we put the houses for the horses.\\
413 - And here will be your office.\\
414 - You have pens in one drawer and paper in the other.\\
415 - First, I put them in the same drawer together,\\
416 - but no, that did not work.\\
417 - But if you want to try it that way, you're the boss, huh?\\
418 - Ah, here is Zeke.\\
419 - Zeke, meet Francis.\\
420 - Howdy. How y'all doing?\\
421 - He is the new ranch foreman.\\
422 - He will be in charge of the livestock,\\
423 - of the feeding schedules,\\
424 - of the equipment rental...\\
425 - well, everything.\\
426 - I must go and set up the buffet.\\
427 - I'm sure you have lots of cowboy things to talk about, huh?\\
428 - All right, look, I might as well tell you now,\\
429 - 'cause you're going to find out in about 30 seconds anyway.\\
430 - I'm not a real cowboy.\\
431 - My name isn't even Zeke, it's Murray,\\
432 - and I have no idea what in the hell I'm doing around here.\\
433 - You have no idea?\\
434 - I've never worked on a ranch in my life.\\
435 - Really? Yeah. I've never even been\\
436 - near a horse you don't put quarters in.\\
437 - Oh, that's great.\\
438 - Listen, you know, you stepped into a gold mine here.\\
439 - I mean, the people who run this place are absolute idiots.\\
440 - Oh, I don't know. They seem really nice.\\
441 - "Nice" isn't the word for it.\\
442 - I mean, you don't have to do a lick of work\\
443 - and they'll still pay you.\\
444 - You're kidding? I'm telling you,\\
445 - all we got to do is watch each other's backs\\
446 - and we can milk these people for all they're worth.\\
447 - What do you think?\\
448 - I think you're fired.\\
449 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
450 - I'm going to find out if this is for me or the horse.\\
451 - You broke our agreement!\\
452 - What agreement?!\\
453 - We never had an agreement!\\
454 - It was a mutual understanding!\\
455 - At least on my end!\\
456 - You are overreacting.\\
457 - So, I was dating a few guys when we met--\\
458 - what difference does it make?\\
459 - A few? Well, how many were there, Lois?\\
460 - Don't you get it? It doesn't matter.\\
461 - You won! It's history. It's over.\\
462 - Your engagement ring is not a family heirloom.\\
463 - What?\\
464 - I lied to you. I bought it.\\
465 - So you bought it.\\
466 - For someone else.\\
467 - Someone else?\\
468 - I'm sorry.\\
469 - I have kept that secret for so many years.\\
470 - It's haunted me.\\
471 - Look, I always knew\\
472 - that I had to tell you, but I didn't know how.\\
473 - Who was it?\\
474 - Farrah Fawcett.\\
475 - I was 15.\\
476 - I knew there were a lot of guys after her,\\
477 - but I thought that if I had an actual ring to give her\\
478 - that I would stand apart from those other idiots.\\
479 - I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before now.\\
480 - Well, why don't we just call it even.\\
481 - Hey, Randy, it's Bill.\\
482 - Are those two kids still trapped in the tiger den?\\
483 - Okay, everybody, calm down.\\
484 - Calm down.\\
485 - I'm obviously just picking up a transmission\\
486 - from the zoo down the road.\\
487 - Reese and Malcolm?\\
488 - Malcolm and Dewey.\\
489 - Reese wouldn't last 30 seconds.\\
490 - I think Stanley's getting angry.\\
491 - You named them?\\
492 - That's Stanley.\\
493 - That's French Fry.\\
494 - Dewey, I want to tell you something.\\
495 - I love you.\\
496 - Don't say that!\\
497 - It's true.\\
498 - I love you so much.\\
499 - You're just saying that\\
500 - 'cause you think we're going to die.\\
501 - This is all part of your hating life thing.\\
502 - You're wrong. I love life.\\
503 - I realize that now.\\
504 - It's imperfect, but I love that, too.\\
505 - And I love Mom and Dad and Francis\\
506 - and even Reese. I love you all.\\
507 - Stop it. We're going to be fine.\\
508 - Why don't you stop it, Dewey?\\
509 - Why don't you stop pretending everything's great\\
510 - and tell me you love me, okay?\\
511 - We're not going to die!\\
512 - Yes, we are! We're going to die!\\
513 - This is the ultimate proof that I was right all along!\\
514 - And I don't need some stupid little kid\\
515 - giving me fake reassurances!\\
516 - Well, I don't need some crybaby brother\\
517 - taking all the fun out of being at the zoo!\\
518 - Oh, my God!\\
519 - You're just in a bad mood.\\
520 - We'll get out of this.\\
521 - No, we won't. Give it up, Dewey.\\
522 - Superman isn't going to fly in here and save us.\\
523 - In your face, goat! Who's laughing...\\
524 - Open up, open up!\\
525 - Ever since the zoo, I've had a new lease on life.\\
526 - It's amazing how something as simple\\
527 - as almost being eaten by tigers can put things in perspective.\\
528 - It just feels so good to be happy again.\\
529 - Of course, why do  I\\
530 - always have to learn my lessons the hard way?\\
531 - No one else does.\\
532 - I mean, why does the universe think it has to almost kill me\\
533 - to get a point across?\\
534 - My life sucks.\\
535 - I'm going to bed.\\
536 - No, Francis, everything turned out fine.\\
537 - We agreed not to sue them,\\
538 - and they agreed not to throw Reese in jail.\\
539 - Enough about that. Tell me about your new job.\\
540 - Oh, it's great.\\
541 - I've learned so much already.\\
542 - Say, while you were at the zoo,\\
543 - you didn't happen to see any animals giving birth, did you?\\
544 - No. Why?\\
545 - Just curious.\\
546 - Never mind.\\
547 - Almost there, sweetie. Just one more push.
\subsection {Episode 02: Humilithon}
1 - Hello.\\
2 - Dad, hi.\\
3 - Oh, Francis.\\
4 - How's the new job? Oh, it's good.\\
5 - I'm learning all kinds of new things.\\
6 - I got lots of responsibility.\\
7 - I'm actually making some good money.\\
8 - Hey, good for you.\\
9 - Dad, listen, I know I owe you guys a lot of money\\
10 - and I want to start paying you back.\\
11 - So I'm sending you $50 this month, and then my plan is...\\
12 - What do you need $50 for?\\
13 - No, I'm sending  you  $50.\\
14 - Francis, I can't spare $50.\\
15 - No, I'm sending  you  the money...\\
16 - Just give him the $50. We have to go.\\
17 - All right, your mother says it's okay, but we have to go.\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - It's the first day of school.\\
31 - Everyone else is bummed,\\
32 - but I'm actually excited about it.\\
33 - I'm officially done with junior high.\\
34 - I'm not a Krelboyne anymore.\\
35 - I can be whatever I want to be.\\
36 - I don't have to worry about labels or cliques or who's cool.\\
37 - I'm going into high school.\\
38 - By the way, this is an excited twitch,\\
39 - not a nervous twitch.\\
40 - Can we please just eat our breakfast\\
41 - and stop all this complaining?\\
42 - But I don't understand.\\
43 - Why do we have to volunteer for the whole first week?\\
44 - Because we got caught, Hal.\\
45 - We ducked out for 12 years.\\
46 - They were bound to get us eventually.\\
47 - Dewey, come here.\\
48 - Listen, you're going to be\\
49 - coming home from school\\
50 - at 3:00 this year.\\
51 - So this is the key to the house.\\
52 - You will come straight home, you will let yourself in\\
53 - and you will be in this house alone\\
54 - until your brothers get here\\
55 - exactly 15 minutes later, and not\\
56 - one second more!\\
57 - We're giving this to you because we trust you.\\
58 - Congratulations.\\
59 - You're now a latchkey kid.\\
60 - Point four miles to go.\\
61 - Malcolm, if any big kids bother you,\\
62 - you go straight to your old teacher.\\
63 - I'm not going to Mr. Herkabe for anything.\\
64 - Point two.\\
65 - Why not? He's the new dean of discipline.\\
66 - Talk about having friends in high places.\\
67 - He's not a friend, he's a psychopath.\\
68 - He's been out to get me since the day we met.\\
69 - He actually told me that.\\
70 - What the heck is wrong with this stupid car?\\
71 - I've gone 30 miles since the gas light came on last night,\\
72 - and we're still going.\\
73 - Hal, look. There's the parking lot.\\
74 - You can let us out here. Yeah, Dad, here's good.\\
75 - Don't be silly. We're all going to the same place.\\
76 - Hal, look. A spot right up front.\\
77 - Right next to the cheerleaders.\\
78 - Thanks for what you did back there.\\
79 - The firecracker did all the work.\\
80 - That's the good thing about cheerleaders.\\
81 - They stampede easy.\\
82 - Let's get inside before Mom and Dad see...\\
83 - Ah, the golden boy has returned.\\
84 - Release the doves.\\
85 - Hi, Mr. Herkabe.\\
86 - And you must be Reese.\\
87 - I have been\\
88 - thoroughly briefed on you,\\
89 - and if you do one thing wrong,\\
90 - I'm going to go medieval on your permanent record.\\
91 - Ask yourself, whatever happened\\
92 - to the old dean of discipline?\\
93 - Mr. Herkabe.\\
94 - Good morning. It is so exciting\\
95 - being here on the first day of school.\\
96 - Yes. It's like being at the cockfights\\
97 - before they open the cages.\\
98 - So the two hours a day-- does that include travel time?\\
99 - Because there was a lot of traffic.\\
100 - So, you'll be handing out health forms\\
101 - and you... report to the North Field.\\
102 - Can't we do something together?\\
103 - Let me check.\\
104 - Uh... no.\\
105 - But don't we both\\
106 - feel better knowing we tried?\\
107 - I am so sorry.\\
108 - I'll have your horse ready in two minutes.\\
109 - We're a little shorthanded today.\\
110 - I had to help make breakfast.\\
111 - You'll be riding Sparky here.\\
112 - I'll get him saddled right up for you.\\
113 - Would you like a croissant while you wait?\\
114 - Oh, sure. Good morning, Francis.\\
115 - What a beautiful day.\\
116 - Otto, can I talk to you?\\
117 - Yeah.\\
118 - How is your lovely wife?\\
119 - You know, you should start having babies right away.\\
120 - And you must breast-feed.\\
121 - Yeah, listen.\\
122 - What happened to Bill and Andy?\\
123 - Neither one of them showed up for their shifts today.\\
124 - Bill and Andy are on vacation. I thought I told you.\\
125 - Well, who's supposed to be covering for them?\\
126 - Let us have a look.\\
127 - Ah, here.\\
128 - You see? Alex and Dan are filling in.\\
129 - No. You let them go fishing until next Wednesday.\\
130 - Otto, I think it's wonderful\\
131 - that you're so accommodating,\\
132 - but sometimes you just have to say no.\\
133 - I mean, you're running a business.\\
134 - Wait a second.\\
135 - Is that the same dog from July?\\
136 - Orientation: North Hall, two-six.\\
137 - All right, it's okay. I'll find it. It's cool.\\
138 - Is this the North Quad?\\
139 - Oh, man.\\
140 - Malcolm!\\
141 - Malcolm!\\
142 - Hey, silly, we're over here.\\
143 - Malcolm.\\
144 - Have you looked at these\\
145 - Rorschach tests they're calling maps?\\
146 - Yeah, they're confusing, but do you guys\\
147 - think you can talk a little softer?\\
148 - I'm ready...\\
149 - to cry.\\
150 - They're not to scale.\\
151 - How do they expect anyone to use\\
152 - a map that's not to scale?\\
153 - Guys...\\
154 - Come on, this is exciting.\\
155 - I mean, I'm so disoriented.\\
156 - Keep me away from the heavy machinery.\\
157 - Where are you going?\\
158 - I told you we should have taken a dry run last week!\\
159 - But, no, "Dabney's an alarmist!"\\
160 - Well, now look where we are!\\
161 - Fill out both health forms and your emergency contact card.\\
162 - And feel free to button your top.\\
163 - Boys like a little mystery.\\
164 - This is fun.\\
165 - I don't know why we avoided this for so long.\\
166 - Mine!\\
167 - Mine.\\
168 - Okay, so yesterday wasn't too bad.\\
169 - I didn't make any new friends,\\
170 - but I did manage to avoid all my old ones.\\
171 - I'll make it up to them once I'm popular.\\
172 - Who am I kidding? No, I won't.\\
173 - Malcolm!\\
174 - Malcolm!\\
175 - This is the spot\\
176 - where we'll meet for lunch, okay?\\
177 - Malcolm, did you hear her?\\
178 - Here you go. Thanks.\\
179 - Hi. I can take over from here.\\
180 - Thank you very much.\\
181 - Excuse me. I can't use this book.\\
182 - I need to switch.\\
183 - What did you do?\\
184 - Nothing. I... You can't bring the book back in this condition.\\
185 - No, I just got it like this.\\
186 - I don't think so. If you want another book,\\
187 - you're going to have to pay $40 for it.\\
188 - Next.\\
189 - Mom, you have to talk to this lady.\\
190 - She won't let me return this book.\\
191 - Oh, my God.\\
192 - What did you do to your pants?\\
193 - What?\\
194 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
195 - How did you get a stain there already?\\
196 - Mom, come on.\\
197 - It wasn't there this morning.\\
198 - Mom, stop. It's no big deal.\\
199 - No big deal?\\
200 - You begged me for these pants.\\
201 - You almost started crying in the store when\\
202 - I wasn't going to buy them\\
203 - for you, and now look what you did to them.\\
204 - That looks like that's coming from the inside.\\
205 - Mom, leave me alone. You're embarrassing me.\\
206 - Oh, I am not embarrassing you.\\
207 - Would you be embarrassed by this?\\
208 - No. See? Come on.\\
209 - See if we can find some club soda and get that out.\\
210 - Justice...\\
211 - is swift.\\
212 - I also think we should we have\\
213 - meat loaf on Mondays and not on Tuesdays\\
214 - so we can have an extra day of meat loaf sandwiches.\\
215 - I also think the table should be in front of the TV\\
216 - and the couch should be in front of the refrigerator.\\
217 - I also think\\
218 - there should be hand-me-ups instead of hand-me-downs,\\
219 - I think kids should be able to steer,\\
220 - and I think school should be only four hours a day\\
221 - and should be held on top of the building.\\
222 - I also think...\\
223 - Okay, Angela comes back tomorrow.\\
224 - So she can cover for Todd on the nature hike\\
225 - and, that way, Todd can help out in the kitchen\\
226 - which will free up Sonja to do the hayride.\\
227 - That is such a good plan.\\
228 - Angela's vacation is over, right?\\
229 - I extended it.\\
230 - It rained her first two days.\\
231 - Kiss your mint.\\
232 - Okay, got to make up some ground.\\
233 - Here's what I'm going to do--\\
234 - be the first freshman with a girlfriend.\\
235 - It's worth a shot, right?\\
236 - I was going to give it a few weeks before asking someone out.\\
237 - Wait till I liked some girl, she liked me... whatever.\\
238 - But I'll just move it up.\\
239 - Hi.\\
240 - Oh. Hey, Stain.\\
241 - What?\\
242 - Hey, Stain.\\
243 - Stain.\\
244 - Thank you.\\
245 - Hey, Stain.\\
246 - Yo, Stain, what's up?\\
247 - Don't pass out.\\
248 - Breathe in through your nose.\\
249 - You can pull this out.\\
250 - Will you be my girlfriend?\\
251 - How's it going?\\
252 - Look, every bulletin is lined up perfectly\\
253 - with the one next to it and the one above and below.\\
254 - Thumbtacks just bring out this side in me.\\
255 - Very nice.\\
256 - You know, it's weird being back in high school.\\
257 - But it's kind of fun, too.\\
258 - Brings back memories.\\
259 - Yeah. Does it? Yeah.\\
260 - Well! What have we here?\\
261 - Have you finished cleaning up the cigarette butts\\
262 - on the football field?\\
263 - I'll get to it.\\
264 - You know, we alone determine\\
265 - how much we get out of any given experience.\\
266 - I said, I'll get to it.\\
267 - Jerkabe.\\
268 - You're so bad.\\
269 - Am I?\\
270 - What's that look?\\
271 - You're dreaming.\\
272 - Forget it. Don't be stupid.\\
273 - There are too many people around.\\
274 - We'd get caught for sure.\\
275 - It wouldn't be fun.\\
276 - It wouldn't be comfortable.\\
277 - There's no good place.\\
278 - This utility closet will be locked for sure.\\
279 - There's no room for two people in here.\\
280 -     Papa loves mambo    \\
281 -     Mama loves mambo    \\
282 -     Look good and sway with it    \\
283 -     Gettin' so gay with it    \\
284 -     Shoutin' ol   with it. Wow!    \\
285 -     Papa loves mambo    \\
286 -     Mama loves mambo    \\
287 -     Papa does great with it    \\
288 -     Swings like a gate with it    \\
289 -     He loses weight with it now!    \\
290 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
291 - I'm the fool!\\
292 - I'm the one who thought there was such a thing\\
293 - as kindness and decency in life!\\
294 - Okay.\\
295 - Mr. Herkabe!\\
296 - Mr. Herkabe, uh, listen, uh,\\
297 - I've spent the last half hour... thinking,\\
298 - and, uh, now that I've had a chance to cool off,\\
299 - I-I just wanted to apologize for earlier.\\
300 - Oh?\\
301 - Yeah. I mean, you were just doing your job.\\
302 - Well, your apology is noted and not accepted.\\
303 - What?!\\
304 - Come on, I said I was sorry.\\
305 - Well, it's a little late for that.\\
306 - You're hereby expelled from the program!\\
307 - What?!\\
308 - Remove yourself\\
309 - from school property immediately.\\
310 - Good day, sir.\\
311 - It's just so exciting to be part of something\\
312 - from the very beginning.\\
313 - Stain.\\
314 - It's classic.\\
315 - It's one of those rare nicknames\\
316 - that will stick with a person forever\\
317 - because they are so perfect in their cruelty.\\
318 - Hey, you know what's weird? It's actually\\
319 - wiping out my memory of your old name.\\
320 - Is it Monty?\\
321 - Marco?\\
322 - Murgatroyd?\\
323 - Oh, that pompous little martinet!\\
324 - You should have seen his face!\\
325 - Hal, it's crazy to be upset by this.\\
326 - You didn't want to do it anyway.\\
327 - He didn't know that!\\
328 - That means he thinks he won.\\
329 - Which means I think I lost!\\
330 - But not for long, Lois.\\
331 - Ho-ho, not for long!\\
332 - I want it delivered at 3:00.\\
333 - I don't mean on the truck at 3:00.\\
334 - I mean  here  at 3:00.\\
335 - Not 3:05. Not 3:10. 3:00.\\
336 - Good. My son will sign for it.\\
337 - Hi. You called for a massage?\\
338 - Oh, yeah, yeah, come on in.\\
339 - Just set up right there.\\
340 - This is so great.\\
341 - I hope you're good with lower back pain.\\
342 - Uh, yeah. Absolutely.\\
343 - I specialize in... vertebrae... sciatic...\\
344 - impactions of the back.\\
345 - Oh, that sounds perfect!\\
346 - Happy anniversary, honey.\\
347 - I'm going to be in the salon.\\
348 - Take your time.\\
349 - Face up or face down?\\
350 - Why, what are you going to do to me?\\
351 - The massage.\\
352 - Oh, yeah.\\
353 - Oh... oh, there it is!\\
354 - Ah, yeah, baby. Oh...\\
355 - Oh! That's the sign of a good massage.\\
356 - Oh! That means I'm totally relaxed.\\
357 -        \\
358 - We don't mean to inflict ourselves on you,\\
359 - but there's no other places.\\
360 - Look, we know you've had a rough couple of days,\\
361 - but things are about to get better.\\
362 - We joined...\\
363 - the chess club.\\
364 - They love geniuses!\\
365 - I was voted king.\\
366 - I'm the queen--\\
367 - which is actually the more powerful position.\\
368 - And they're excited to meet you, too.\\
369 - I told them your opinion on the Luzhin defense.\\
370 - It raised a few eyebrows, but you're as good as in.\\
371 - I don't deserve you guys.\\
372 - I'm sorry I ignored you, and I appreciate the gesture,\\
373 - but you're really better off without me.\\
374 - Oh, come on.\\
375 - Will you get off this sulking thing?\\
376 - Since when do you care\\
377 - what other people think of you?\\
378 - Cynthia, don't do this.\\
379 - Malcolm, you hate everyone.\\
380 - To you, everyone's either a moron or a creep or a poseur.\\
381 - Why do you suddenly care about their opinion of you?\\
382 - Because I'm shallow, okay?\\
383 - I want them to like me.\\
384 - It's not so bad, Malcolm.\\
385 - It's only the first week.\\
386 - You have, like, four years of high school left.\\
387 - It's okay.\\
388 - I spent three years being a Krelboyne.\\
389 - I can spend four years being a joke.\\
390 - Malcolm, you're not a joke.\\
391 - Hey, Stainalator!\\
392 - Bruce Spring-stain.\\
393 - What are you doing?\\
394 - Mopping.\\
395 - In five minutes, I will have my two hours,\\
396 - and that will discharge my obligation\\
397 - to the volunteer program.\\
398 - Oh, no, it does not, because you have been expelled.\\
399 - All I know is I've been mopping!\\
400 - And this floor looks pretty darn clean to me.\\
401 - But that was unauthorized mopping.\\
402 - It is spotless, and maybe we should just see whether\\
403 - the principal thinks it's a job well done.\\
404 - It's not even clean.\\
405 - Don't you dare!\\
406 - No!\\
407 - Now let's see if you're...\\
408 - I'd just like to say\\
409 - in my defense...\\
410 - he started it.\\
411 - Ah, Francis, there you are.\\
412 - Oh, look at you tidying up.\\
413 - Otto, we have to talk.\\
414 - We will talk tomorrow.\\
415 - Come, I want to show you something.\\
416 - No! Tomorrow I may be leading aerobics again\\
417 - or faking my way through a wine-tasting seminar\\
418 - or-or playing the prostitute in the Old West stunt show.\\
419 - That  was  you!\\
420 - The way you run this place,\\
421 - sometimes it's not being nice.\\
422 - It's-it's being careless and foolish.\\
423 - Look.\\
424 - Yes, it's a truck.\\
425 - Look, Otto, I don't want to leave you high and...\\
426 - It is  your  truck. What?\\
427 - I saw it... I thought of you.\\
428 - Your car blew up, yeah?\\
429 - I thought  this  would be a good thing for you.\\
430 - You see, this is what I'm talking about.\\
431 - You are the best boss ever!\\
432 - I wish I could tell you to take a few days\\
433 - and drive it someplace nice,\\
434 - but we're a little shorthanded.\\
435 - I understand, believe me.\\
436 - Just kidding!\\
437 - Go. Take a week. Have fun.\\
438 - Malcolm!\\
439 - Malcolm, hey, come to the "Y" with me.\\
440 - I think a good yoga class would really help center you.\\
441 - A-And there  are  boys.\\
442 - Mom's here! What?\\
443 - Dad got in trouble. Mom is freaking out.\\
444 - Whatever you do, stay out of her way.\\
445 - Oh, my God.\\
446 - I know what I'm going to do.\\
447 - What are you talking about?\\
448 - I'm going get sent to military school.\\
449 - Malcolm!\\
450 - Malcolm!\\
451 - What are you doing?\\
452 - My dad has a hide-a-key.\\
453 - Here we go.\\
454 - I don't want to be a stickler,\\
455 - but you don't have the right decal for this lot.\\
456 - Malcolm, stop this.\\
457 - You don't have a license.\\
458 - That's okay. I'm just going\\
459 - to crash into my mom's car.\\
460 - This is crazy, Malcolm!\\
461 - This is the stupidest thing\\
462 - I've ever heard.\\
463 - No, it's not, it's smart.\\
464 - I just take this car and crash it into that car.\\
465 - Then I'll be in military school just like Francis was.\\
466 - It'll be paradise.\\
467 - Somebody... with feet...\\
468 - stop him!\\
469 - For the love of God,\\
470 - your shirttail's stuck in the door!\\
471 - Take me with you!\\
472 - What's going on? I don't know, man.\\
473 - Stop!\\
474 - I won't let you do this!\\
475 - I would rather die than be left alone with Mom!\\
476 - Get out of the way!\\
477 - No!\\
478 - You can run me over. I don't care!\\
479 - Malcolm!\\
480 - If you do this,\\
481 - I will never have sex with you again.\\
482 - Again?\\
483 - They had sex? He had sex with her?\\
484 - That kid had sex?\\
485 - She's a slut.\\
486 - She's a big slut.\\
487 - Oh, my God, what a slut.\\
488 - Wow, I could really learn a lesson from this,\\
489 - but all I can think about right now\\
490 - is how the whole school is convinced that I had se...\\
491 - You get out of that car this instant!\\
492 - What the heck is wrong with you?!\\
493 - Here, take my pancakes.\\
494 - Oh, and I did your laundry.\\
495 - I folded them warm so they wouldn't wrinkle.\\
496 - Reese, I'm not going to tell you about it.\\
497 - It didn't even happen.\\
498 - Okay.\\
499 - Where  didn't it happen?\\
500 - Son, I know it's been tough for you\\
501 - spending all your time by yourself after school.\\
502 - I've been trying to adjust.\\
503 - Well, guess what. You don't have to anymore.\\
504 - That's all over now.\\
505 - I rearranged my schedule\\
506 - so I can get home earlier.\\
507 - Isn't that great? We're going to spend\\
508 - a lot more time together. What do you say,\\
509 - this weekend, you help me clean out the garage?
\subsection {Episode 03: Family Reunion}
1 - Hal, you've been out here for six hours.\\
2 - That's all you're throwing away?\\
3 - No. This is my "maybe" pile.\\
4 - Look, I want to able to fit the van in the garage.\\
5 - That's the whole point of having a garage!\\
6 - You don't realize how complicated this is.\\
7 - Hal. Lois, I promise you.\\
8 - The van will fit in the garage!\\
9 - I think you owe me an apology.\\
10 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
11 -     I don't know    \\
12 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     Life is unfair.    \\
22 - Francis is home visiting with his wife, Piama.\\
23 - It's been so nice around here since they came.\\
24 - Good dinner, Mom.\\
25 - Please. It's completely overcooked.\\
26 - You must really be hurting for some decent cooking.\\
27 - See? Mom's so busy being mean to Piama,\\
28 - she doesn't even notice us.\\
29 - We've been getting away with murder.\\
30 - Hello?\\
31 - Uh, hi, Claire.\\
32 - It's my sister! Oh, God.\\
33 - I'm gonna hang up on her.\\
34 - No, Hal. Find out what she wants.\\
35 - So what's up?\\
36 - Uh-huh.\\
37 - Family reunion this weekend for my Dad's birthday.\\
38 - I'm sorry, Claire, but I'm having foot surgery,\\
39 - so we'll have to pass.\\
40 - No, Hal, it's been too long already, we should go.\\
41 - But you know what, my foot feels fine now.\\
42 - So, I'm going to cancel that surgery\\
43 - and we'll see you Saturday. Wait a minute.\\
44 - They're inviting us only two days before\\
45 - we have to be there? Forget it, Hal.\\
46 - They don't want us there.\\
47 - But you can never be too careful with feet.\\
48 - Which is exactly why we should go.\\
49 - What am I thinking?\\
50 - I've already had foot surgery.\\
51 - Okay, so we'll see you Saturday.\\
52 - So what's Grandpa like?\\
53 - He's okay, but the rest of Dad's family\\
54 - treat Mom like crap; they're jerks.\\
55 - Rich jerks, and Grandpa's the richest of them all.\\
56 - And he loves kids; just say and do\\
57 - what I tell you, and we'll be set for life.\\
58 - You're nuts. Look, it's too late for you and me,\\
59 - but Dewey's still young and adorable.\\
60 - Although we do have a narrow window to work with.\\
61 - In a year, you're gonna look like a freak.\\
62 - Sorry it's so cramped, Piama.\\
63 - This van really isn't designed to carry seven people.\\
64 - Oh. I guess I was thrown off by the seven seats\\
65 - and the seven seat belts.\\
66 - Uh, Francis, how's that ranch job treating you?\\
67 - Oh, great. Never a dull moment.\\
68 - In fact, last week I got to castrate a bull calf.\\
69 - What does castrate mean?\\
70 - Ask your mother.\\
71 - You know, I have always wanted to know\\
72 - how to castrate a bull calf.\\
73 - Tell me about it.\\
74 - Well, it's fascinating stuff.\\
75 - We use this tool called a burdizzo--\\
76 - it looks like a giant pair of pliers--\\
77 - and the calf has to be restrained\\
78 - so that it doesn't kick...\\
79 - ...so once you cut off their blood supply,\\
80 - they shrivel up and are replaced by fat tissue.\\
81 - What a great story, Francis.\\
82 - It really made the last hour and a half fly by.\\
83 - Here come the clones.\\
84 - Hal, be nice.\\
85 - Hey, there's my kid brother!\\
86 - Hi, Claire. Hello, Tom.\\
87 - Hal, that shirt looks fabulous on you.\\
88 - Honey, isn't he looking handsome?\\
89 - He certainly is.\\
90 - Lois.\\
91 - Hey!\\
92 - Who's this? Your cousin Pete.\\
93 - Pete-O!\\
94 - What's this?\\
95 - Your dad's birthday present; we all chipped in.\\
96 - We? We're going to chip in, too.\\
97 - Oh, don't worry, we'll put your name on the card.\\
98 - Eh, come on.\\
99 - Let's get you inside.\\
100 - You must be worn out from that drive.\\
101 - Actually, it wasn't so bad.\\
102 - Nonsense. Look at those sweat stains on Lois.\\
103 - Wow.\\
104 - It figures this is the side of the family we never see.\\
105 - Meanwhile, the grandma who goes shopping in her bra\\
106 - visits five times a year.\\
107 - We can leave right now.\\
108 - Just get in the car and drive.\\
109 - Sandusky Caverns is just 40 minutes from here.\\
110 - Hal, relax. We can do this.\\
111 - I can't help it.\\
112 - I work myself into knots\\
113 - whenever I have to face the grand patriarch.\\
114 - Hi, Dad!\\
115 - Hal, you made it!\\
116 - Anybody help an old man out of the pool?\\
117 - I got you, Grandpa.\\
118 - Aah, right.\\
119 - Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.\\
120 - What do you think that guy's for?\\
121 - His name is Francis.\\
122 - If you kill him, you don't get another one.\\
123 - Welcome one and all!\\
124 - Hey.\\
125 - Lois.\\
126 - Dewey!\\
127 - Goodness, you've grown!\\
128 - I bet you don't even remember me.\\
129 - Yes, I do.\\
130 - You thang to me when I wath thweeping.\\
131 - You remember that?!\\
132 - Why, that's adorable!\\
133 - So good to see you, Dad.\\
134 - I have to admit, I was a little nervous about coming back here\\
135 - after so much time had gone by.\\
136 - I was expecting...\\
137 - Expecting car trouble?\\
138 - Because it looks like you packed a spare tire!\\
139 - Ah, Malcolm!\\
140 - I understand they finally figured out you're a genius.\\
141 - What's your favorite subject in school?\\
142 - I don't know. History.\\
143 - History, is it?\\
144 - What do you think about the Civil War?\\
145 - I guess it's kind of interesting.\\
146 - Ooh. Have I got something to show you!\\
147 - - There you two are! - Hi, Amelia.\\
148 - This reunion is going to be the death of me.\\
149 - Feeding this many people every day.\\
150 - Keeping track of all the kids.\\
151 - I swear I had to run the croquet tournament on Thursday\\
152 - all by myself.\\
153 - Tomorrow we've got a pancake breakfast,\\
154 - a family photo at 3:00, a birthday dinner at 5:00\\
155 - and gifts at 6:00, all with no one to take charge but me.\\
156 - This is what General Schwarzkopf\\
157 - must have felt like during Desert Storm!\\
158 - Lois, no one else is wearing a name tag.\\
159 - Hal, it's fine.\\
160 - Hey, untie his hands and give him his pants back!\\
161 - You're the only grandkid I've let in here.\\
162 - These are my  most precious possessions.\\
163 - Cool.\\
164 - Oh, never mind that stuff.\\
165 - You don't want to waste your time with a bunch of guns.\\
166 - Take a look at this quartermasters' ledger books.\\
167 - This is where the war was really won.\\
168 - Take a look at this.\\
169 - Notice anything?\\
170 - Oh, yeah. The numbers don't add up here. Ah.\\
171 - What?\\
172 - In that column.\\
173 - The numbers add up to 1,286\\
174 - but the total at the bottom says 1,179.\\
175 - I was just hoping you'd notice how the S's look like F's\\
176 - but this is incredible.\\
177 - I think this quartermaster was skimming rifles.\\
178 - This is the kind of thing that gets your name\\
179 - in the  Civil War Quarterly.\\
180 - Good job, Malcolm!\\
181 - Let's see what else this guy was up to!\\
182 - I would never be massaged by a woman.\\
183 - I mean, you need that strength.\\
184 - When my body's in need,\\
185 - I want a man to really get in there.\\
186 - Okay, just one more lap.\\
187 - Boy, those kids have really taken a shine to Francis.\\
188 - He's not ready for kids, Piama; don't rush him.\\
189 - More cake, Lois?\\
190 - Oh, no, thank you.\\
191 - Ah, don't be shy.\\
192 - I saw the way you scarfed down your first piece.\\
193 - Oh, I'm sorry, you're probably on a diet, aren't you?\\
194 - Dad?\\
195 - Have you seen the cookies?\\
196 - We have to talk.\\
197 - It's about Lois.\\
198 - Ever since we got here,\\
199 - the family's taken every opportunity to...\\
200 - Dad, don't do the face.\\
201 - What face?\\
202 - No, you know the face!\\
203 - Don't do that, I'm serious.\\
204 - Oh. Can I do the voice?\\
205 - Dad, I'm not kidding.\\
206 - Then why are you laughing?\\
207 - Dad!\\
208 - Nothing funny heeere.\\
209 - No, sireeeeee!\\
210 - Okay, you want a story, here's a story.\\
211 - It's called "The Kids Who Couldn't Play By Themselves."\\
212 - We did some good work today.\\
213 - Tomorrow, we'll hit Grandpa\\
214 - with the "Good Ship Lollipop" number right after breakfast.\\
215 - I want to swim in the pool.\\
216 - You can swim in the pool when we own the pool.\\
217 - Nice angle you're working with Grandpa, Malcolm.\\
218 - I have to admit, you're getting a lot of face time\\
219 - but when he croaks, all he's gonna leave you\\
220 - is that stupid Civil War crap.\\
221 - Reese... You can have it, but I want it\\
222 - out of the house.\\
223 - Back off Grandpa. He's ours.\\
224 - What?\\
225 - We've been working this guy for three years,\\
226 - and we're not about to let you waltz in here\\
227 - and snake him out from under us.\\
228 - What are you saying?\\
229 - It's a big house; accidents happen.\\
230 - ...and then the little boy, about your age,\\
231 - was found hanging in the moonlight,\\
232 - strangled by his own intestines.\\
233 - And there was just enough life left in him to say...\\
234 - "You're next!!"\\
235 - Come out!\\
236 - He was lying; it was just a story.\\
237 - All I want is two seconds of honest, human conversation\\
238 - with my own father.\\
239 - I mean, what is so awful about me\\
240 - that he has to distance himself with jokes and silly faces?\\
241 - Hal, you're not going to make any progress\\
242 - if you keep personalizing other people's problems.\\
243 - We've talked about this. You just don't get it.\\
244 - How could you? You don't have any father issues.\\
245 - I'm blessed.\\
246 - There's got to be some way to break this cycle.\\
247 - Some way to make my dad let his guard down\\
248 - and engage me on an emotional level...\\
249 - Are you even listening?\\
250 - Sorry.\\
251 - Oh!\\
252 - Hal, the answer to this is simple.\\
253 - You just have to look at your life;\\
254 - look at what you've accomplished.\\
255 - You  have  a good relationship with your sons.\\
256 - They can talk to you about anything.\\
257 - You have a wife and home and family\\
258 - a lot of people would envy.\\
259 - You're past this.\\
260 - You think?\\
261 - Yes, I do.\\
262 - Hal, you're all grown up.\\
263 - Uh-oh.\\
264 - What?\\
265 - I...\\
266 - I wet the bed.\\
267 - Oh, that tears it, Lois.\\
268 - You know I've been telling myself that everything's okay,\\
269 - but my bladder knew different.\\
270 - I am not leaving here until I've had this out with my dad.\\
271 - Hal, are you sure you want to do this?\\
272 - Lois, he just sits by\\
273 - while everyone treats you like a dog,\\
274 - when they're not treating you like a servant.\\
275 - It's not that bad. Did you notice last night\\
276 - when you gave Helen your chair\\
277 - and she flipped the cushion over before she sat down?\\
278 - No.\\
279 - Why are we staring at a mall, Grandpa?\\
280 - This is a battlefield, Private,\\
281 - and I'm not your Grandpa.\\
282 - I'm Captain Atticus P. Featherton,\\
283 - commander of the Company "A" cavalry.\\
284 - It's 1864.\\
285 - Cannonballs are flying overhead.\\
286 - The nostrils curl with the smell of burning flesh.\\
287 - Can I get a yogurt?\\
288 - You're ravaged by dysentery, you don't want a yogurt.\\
289 - Edith, where are my keys?\\
290 - They're supposed to be in the key thingy.\\
291 - I can't trust you with anything.\\
292 - Now, there's Confederate sharpshooters\\
293 - on that ridge over there.\\
294 - We have to sit very still while we wait for our orders\\
295 - or they'll pick us off one by one.\\
296 - But... Very still, Private.\\
297 - More still than that!\\
298 - Isn't this great?\\
299 - I asked for these to be ironed.\\
300 - What is wrong with you people?\\
301 - Nice touch with the backwards "E."\\
302 - You've got a real gift for this butt kissing stuff.\\
303 - We are so in.\\
304 - What do you mean "we"?\\
305 - Ma, you got to let us hide in here; these kids...\\
306 - What's wrong?\\
307 - Oh, I forgot to pack my good shoes.\\
308 - I can't believe it. What am I supposed to do?\\
309 - All I've got are my sneakers.\\
310 - I'm supposed to take them off and run around barefoot\\
311 - like a hillbilly in front of these people?\\
312 - Mom, it's just shoes. Relax.\\
313 - Oh, Francis, it's not just shoes.\\
314 - You have no idea what it's like\\
315 - trying to please someone else's family\\
316 - and always coming up short.\\
317 - And would it kill you to dress up a little\\
318 - for a family picture?\\
319 - Oh, hey, Hal.\\
320 - You know, that Malcolm of yours\\
321 - doesn't handle the heat very well.\\
322 - Dad, we need to talk. This is serious.\\
323 - Then I better put on my serious face.\\
324 - No, Dad, no faces.\\
325 - Unless we deal with this,\\
326 - you and I will never have a meaningful relationship.\\
327 - Our relationship is fine.\\
328 - No, it's not fine.\\
329 - There's a big piece missing.\\
330 - Oh, sure we laugh,\\
331 - we-we have fun, but that's all we do.\\
332 - We just skim along the surface\\
333 - without talking about anything important.\\
334 - Do you understand?\\
335 - Let's ask Mr. Tickles.\\
336 - Remember, Mr. Tickles?\\
337 - No, Dad, I mean it!\\
338 - Well, Mr. Tickles means it, too.\\
339 - We used to do this all the time when you were a kid.\\
340 - You loved Mr. Tickles.\\
341 - Ooh, it's almost picture time.\\
342 - Hey, this was fun, Hal.\\
343 - I'm glad you're feeling better.\\
344 - Oh!\\
345 - That's not where we keep the liquor.\\
346 - I'm not looking for liquor.\\
347 - I'm looking for shoes.\\
348 - For some reason, I forgot to pack my good shoes\\
349 - and now I have nothing to wear with this dress\\
350 - that I rushed out to buy so I would look nice for this family\\
351 - that thinks I can't\\
352 - do anything right.\\
353 - You know what?\\
354 - I have some extra shoes in the back of our car.\\
355 - I bet they might fit you.\\
356 - Really?\\
357 - It's the black Jaguar parked out by the gate.\\
358 - It's unlocked.\\
359 - Thank you. Really.\\
360 - Don't you guys want to be with your parents?\\
361 - My socks are itchy.\\
362 - Malcolm, I hear your sock itchiness\\
363 - and I'm glad you're telling me about it.\\
364 - You boys should know that I am here for you\\
365 - anytime you want to talk about anything.\\
366 - After we get this picture taken,\\
367 - I'm going to spend some time with each of you\\
368 - because I am involved and into everything\\
369 - that's going on with this family.\\
370 - Where's your mother?\\
371 - Amelia?\\
372 - There aren't any shoes in your car.\\
373 - Are you sure...?\\
374 - Okay, everybody, big smiles.\\
375 - Cheese on three. One, two...\\
376 - three.\\
377 - Cheese!\\
378 - Okay, let me get one more real quick.\\
379 - Excellent.\\
380 - Thank you, everybody.\\
381 - You weren't in the photo, Lois?\\
382 - Well, I guess we can try to take another one.\\
383 - You know, if we can regather everybody.\\
384 - And if we can get the photographer back.\\
385 - And talk to the caterers\\
386 - to see if they can hold off on dinner.\\
387 - Lois, where were you?\\
388 - Honey?\\
389 - Honey?\\
390 - Honey...\\
391 - God.\\
392 - Hey, is Lois going to help with the salad?\\
393 - Oh, God. More drama from that woman.\\
394 - What are you going to do?\\
395 - We don't know. We never know.\\
396 - Hal...\\
397 - what are you doing?\\
398 - Taking a stand for my dignity.\\
399 - You've driven me to this, Dad.\\
400 - My wife is upstairs crying\\
401 - because of the way this family treats her\\
402 - and it's got to stop.\\
403 - Uh-oh.\\
404 - Someone's a Gloomy Gus.\\
405 - You never face up to any real problems, do you?\\
406 - You just think if you make enough jokes, they'll all go away.\\
407 - Don't you see that through my entire life,\\
408 - you've avoided dealing with me\\
409 - whenever I was going through a tough time?\\
410 - Really, this is beyond the pale.\\
411 - You never helped me when my girlfriend dumped me...\\
412 - when my dog died... Hey.\\
413 - when my best friend moved away...\\
414 - when I got beaten up at school...\\
415 - when I spent a whole summer crying\\
416 - and I didn't know why!\\
417 - Hal, stop it!\\
418 - And you haven't helped me while my family has been\\
419 - habitually tormenting my wife\\
420 - to the point where I've had to avoid both them and you!\\
421 - I haven't had a father for the past 15 years\\
422 - because you won't deal with anything!\\
423 - Okay, that's off my chest.\\
424 - I hope you heard it.\\
425 - I love you, Dad.\\
426 - I'll go get you a towel.\\
427 - One of the old ones, please.\\
428 - All right, everybody ready?\\
429 - I was born ready.\\
430 - The cake!\\
431 - The cake! The cart!\\
432 - We had to get out of there pretty fast for our own safety.\\
433 - It was unbelievable. We drove three blocks\\
434 - before Aunt Claire let go of the door handle.\\
435 - I am so very disappointed in all of you.\\
436 - I don't care what those people did,\\
437 - that was no way for you to behave.\\
438 - Right, Hal?\\
439 - Yeah, you boys are on notice.\\
440 - If you  ever  drive a golf cart over a catered dinner\\
441 - and into a swimming pool again,\\
442 - there will be consequences. Dire consequences.\\
443 - I guess we just kissed off a six-figure trust fund.\\
444 - I told Grandpa you tied me to the golf cart.\\
445 - What?!\\
446 - He still likes you.\\
447 - Nice, we're back in the game.\\
448 - Yeah.\\
449 - Oh, Piama.\\
450 - Is that too much air on you?\\
451 - No.
\subsection {Episode 04: Stupid Girl}
1 - What?\\
2 - What?\\
3 - Okay,  I  ate the cupcakes you baked\\
4 - for Dewey's class last night.\\
5 - And I took Dad's license to make a fake I.D.\\
6 - And I can't return your necklace\\
7 - because I already sold it.\\
8 - I was just going to say\\
9 - your shirt didn't go with your pants.\\
10 - Oh.\\
11 - Phew!\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Would you like some more orange juice, Stevie?\\
25 - Thank you... Lois.\\
26 - Stevie's staying at our house for a week\\
27 - while his parents are in Hawaii.\\
28 - They get tropical drinks on a beach\\
29 - while he gets to watch my dad air-drying in the kitchen.\\
30 - Did everyone notice the way\\
31 - Stevie pre-sliced the grapefruit sections?\\
32 - It's so nice to have a boy in the house\\
33 - who's not a rude little monster.\\
34 - Hey, was that shot at me?\\
35 - Yes, honey, it was.\\
36 - Hal, I don't have any bread for Dewey's sandwich.\\
37 - You're gonna have to stop by the market on your way to school.\\
38 - No problem.\\
39 - Or you could just give me\\
40 - money for a hot lunch.\\
41 - Don't be silly.\\
42 - Those things aren't nutritious.\\
43 - Why are we in a liquor store?\\
44 - For the bread. Everybody knows\\
45 - liquor stores have the best bread in town\\
46 - Ten lottery tickets, please.\\
47 - I don't see any bread.\\
48 - What are you talking about? There's melba toast.\\
49 - If you can't make a sandwich out of that,\\
50 - you're just not trying hard enough.\\
51 - Oh, my God.\\
52 - What?\\
53 - Dewey, I just won a thousand dollars!\\
54 - A thousand dollars!\\
55 - Yes!\\
56 - What are we going to buy?\\
57 - We're not going to buy anything with this, son.\\
58 - We're going to put this money right into your college fund.\\
59 - A secret college fund that your mother can never know about.\\
60 - Sometimes when it rains, they get stuck.\\
61 - Here.\\
62 - Thanks.\\
63 - Uh, Malcolm, right?\\
64 - Yeah, and I know you're Alison.\\
65 - I'm glad we finally talked\\
66 - after a month of being locker neighbors.\\
67 - "Locker neighbors"?\\
68 - Yeah, we're...\\
69 - This is my locker.\\
70 - Oh! You-- locker neigh...\\
71 - 'cause-'cause we're right next door.\\
72 - Yeah, that-that's funny.\\
73 - I-I get it.\\
74 - Well, uh, see you, neighbor.\\
75 - And keep your damn dog off my lawn!\\
76 - I-I don't have a dog.\\
77 - No, no, I was kidding, because we're neighbors\\
78 - and sometimes neighbors have\\
79 - a problem with their dogs going...\\
80 - See, I always assume people know when I'm kidding,\\
81 - but sometimes it's just so subtle\\
82 - I come off sounding like a jerk.\\
83 - I mean, not too subtle for  you.\\
84 - I don't want to sound condescending.\\
85 - It's just I think about this kind of stuff a lot.\\
86 - And... I should have stopped talking 30 seconds ago, right?\\
87 - Uh, I have to go to gym now.\\
88 - What is wrong with me?\\
89 - How long... you got?\\
90 - I always ruin everything.\\
91 - Even with a perfect girl like Alison.\\
92 - Alison's a moron.\\
93 - She's not the problem.\\
94 - It's me. I overthink everything.\\
95 - I can't even carry on a normal conversation\\
96 - without screwing it up.\\
97 - Why won't my brain just let me be happy?\\
98 - Honey, I got to get going.\\
99 - You heading down to the art gallery?\\
100 - It's not art!\\
101 - Sorry. Heading down to the place\\
102 - where you sell overpriced, pretentious stuff\\
103 - to tourists with more money than taste?\\
104 - You  do  listen.\\
105 - Thank you very much.\\
106 - It was good doing business with you, Mr. Dodson.\\
107 - Ah, Francis, come. Meet Mr. Dodson.\\
108 - He is a wonderful man.\\
109 - We will be doing lots of business with him for sure.\\
110 - Yeah, look, I got to go.\\
111 - Uh, I'm running late for another sales call,\\
112 - so, uh, see you gentlemen around.\\
113 - We will talk soon.\\
114 - Ah, Francis.\\
115 - I am such a lucky man.\\
116 - When I left for this country,\\
117 - all of my friends are warning me, "Otto, Otto, be careful.\\
118 - People will try to take advantage of you."\\
119 - But this is not the case.\\
120 - Like that Mr. Dodson.\\
121 - He knows so much more about ranching than I do.\\
122 - But does he act all superior and high and mighty?\\
123 - No! No! Instead, he teaches me.\\
124 - Like before today, I did not know\\
125 - that cows need ultraviolet protection.\\
126 - What?\\
127 - What is this stuff?\\
128 - Sunscreen.\\
129 - For cows.\\
130 - Otto, how much did you pay for this?\\
131 - $200 a bucket, plus, of course\\
132 - the zinc for their noses.\\
133 - Do not worry.\\
134 - I already paid him.\\
135 - How much time do I get for a thousand bucks?\\
136 - Oh, Mama!\\
137 - I have been dreaming about this for years.\\
138 - What? Are you crazy?\\
139 - We can't do it at my house. My family's there.\\
140 - Uh, but there's a parking lot\\
141 - near my office where we can meet.\\
142 - That's your ground speed indicator\\
143 - and that's your vibration tachometer.\\
144 - Check.\\
145 - Yes, sir!\\
146 - Can't wait to resurface some roads with this baby.\\
147 - Wow, looks like you're all set.\\
148 - Yes. Let me ask you a hypothetical.\\
149 - I mean, if I was to accidentally run over something--\\
150 - I mean crush it into dust\\
151 - where they're completely unrecognizable...\\
152 - You'd want to center it in the middle of the drum.\\
153 - That is, if such a tragic incident should occur.\\
154 - Come again?\\
155 - Look, a lot of our, uh, "road builders" have\\
156 - that inevitable fragile item cross their paths.\\
157 - And if  I  were to encounter such a fragile item...?\\
158 - You'd have no choice but to speed up\\
159 - until that item no longer posed a threat to your road building.\\
160 - Now sign here, and you can get to work.\\
161 - Hoo-hoo-hoo!\\
162 - I can do better.\\
163 - Stevie, you are such an angel.\\
164 - You are welcome to stay with us any time your parents go away.\\
165 - Sure, Hawaii's great,\\
166 - but we're having fun right here, huh?\\
167 - Sure are.\\
168 - Hey! I didn't buy this.\\
169 - 49 cents less.\\
170 - With lotion.\\
171 - Ooh!\\
172 - Don't you have midterms to study for, too?\\
173 - I think I have three tomorrow.\\
174 - Don't you even care that if you don't study,\\
175 - you're going to fail.\\
176 - Nah.\\
177 - How do you do that?\\
178 - What?\\
179 - How do you go through your life\\
180 - without worrying that bad things are going to happen?\\
181 - I don't know.\\
182 - I guess if I feel myself starting to worry,\\
183 - I just sing the Minty-Mint song in my head.\\
184 -     They're cool, they're fresh, they'll clean your breath    \\
185 -     Minty-Mints are your breath's friend.    \\
186 - So, when I just asked you that question about failing,\\
187 - you were thinking about that song?\\
188 - Yep. Boys, for the last time,\\
189 - get in here, and help me with these groceries  now!\\
190 -     Minty-Mints are your breath's friend.    \\
191 - Reese, you're a genius.\\
192 - What? That girl, Alison, just asked me\\
193 - why everyone in the world has accents except for us.\\
194 - And instead of going into this long explanation,\\
195 - I thought of the Minty-Mint song.\\
196 - And all that came out of my mouth was,\\
197 - "Because they're weird," and she liked it.\\
198 - Cool. I could actually feel my brain click off.\\
199 - She said I was cute, and then she touched my shoulder.\\
200 - Let's keep this in the family, understand?\\
201 - Hey, here she comes.\\
202 - Oh, man. I just did it once.\\
203 - What if it was all just a fluke?\\
204 - You'll be fine. I'm too new at this.\\
205 - Just relax. But...\\
206 - Just say what I say.\\
207 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
208 - I-I forgot to ask you something.\\
209 - Hmm...\\
210 - Are you okay?\\
211 - Do you need to get to class or something?\\
212 - No, I'm just killing time till lunch.\\
213 - Oh, I know what you mean.\\
214 - These mornings can just drag on.\\
215 - School's for suckers.\\
216 - It's just some scam thought up by parents\\
217 - so they can stay home all day and party hearty.\\
218 - Oh, my God. I've thought the same thing.\\
219 - I, uh...\\
220 - I think it'd be cool if they took the one-dollar bill\\
221 - and changed it to the million-dollar bill.\\
222 - That way, nobody would be poor, and we'd all be millionaires.\\
223 - That is such a cool idea.\\
224 - I want to help poor people, too.\\
225 - What I wanted to ask you is, um,\\
226 - do you want to go to the dance with me on Friday?\\
227 - Yeah! I was waiting to ask you,\\
228 - but I wanted to find the right time, and the...\\
229 - Uh, awesome.\\
230 - Awesome.\\
231 - I... I got to get to class.\\
232 - Me, too.\\
233 -        \\
234 - Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\\
235 - Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\\
236 - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\\
237 - Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!\\
238 - "College fund"?\\
239 - Dewey! Hi.\\
240 - What brings you out on such a lovely day?\\
241 - I was following my dad on his secret steamroller.\\
242 - Oh, it's not just a steamroller, son.\\
243 - This is a culmination of everything\\
244 - I've worked for in my entire life.\\
245 - And  I've also managed to put away\\
246 - some money for your college.\\
247 - Which, if interest rates hold... Oh, all right!\\
248 - If you don't tell your mother, I'll let you squash something.\\
249 - Can I squash Reese's bike?\\
250 - Sure.\\
251 - It's in the trunk.\\
252 - You want to know what's great?\\
253 - Not thinking so much.\\
254 - It's cool.\\
255 - Usually I'd be all stressed out like Stevie.\\
256 - But I figure life should be-- what's the word?\\
257 - Funner.\\
258 - What'd you get for problem... 17?\\
259 - I drew a tank.\\
260 - What's wrong... with you?\\
261 - Huh?\\
262 - For two days,\\
263 - you've been acting like an idiot.\\
264 - No. For two days,\\
265 - I've acted like someone who's happy and relaxed.\\
266 - You're turning into Reese.\\
267 - So? I'm not stressing out about school\\
268 - and girls and stuff.\\
269 - That doesn't make me an idiot.\\
270 - That makes me the opposite of an idiot.\\
271 - The brain is a muscle.\\
272 - Use it or lose it.\\
273 - But maybe if you use it too much,\\
274 - it'll cramp up on you.\\
275 - Didn't think about that, did you?\\
276 - Malcolm?\\
277 - I fell.\\
278 - Who do you think invented the spoon?\\
279 - Paleo...\\
280 - Spoony Spoonicus.\\
281 - Spoony Spoonicus.\\
282 - That is so awesome.\\
283 - You're supposed to take me ice-skating today.\\
284 - Where were you?\\
285 - I'm sorry, Dewey. I got stuck at the office.\\
286 - So, Hal, I called the office today\\
287 - and they said you took the whole day off.\\
288 - That's right.\\
289 - I spent the whole day ice-skating with Dewey.\\
290 - Oh, you should see the boy, Lois.\\
291 - Twirling and jumping on that ice.\\
292 - He did a double axel\\
293 - that was, quite frankly, exquisite.\\
294 - Hal, we've got to go over\\
295 - next month's budget tonight.\\
296 - Oh, I can't tonight, honey.\\
297 - I have to go into the office to make up for the time\\
298 - I missed with Dewey.\\
299 - Yeah, the office.\\
300 - Can't get enough of the good ol' office.\\
301 - Hello?\\
302 - Malcolm, good, you're home. Listen.\\
303 - Is there some scientific way to find out\\
304 - if something is pudding without actually tasting it?\\
305 - Is it chocolate?\\
306 - No. Why, would that make a difference?\\
307 - I like chocolate.\\
308 - It's browner than the not-chocolate stuff.\\
309 - You didn't by any chance find that coffee can\\
310 - in the garage, did you?\\
311 - You're going to the steamroller,\\
312 - aren't you?\\
313 - So what if I am? I rented it.\\
314 - Why shouldn't I get to use it? It's a free country.\\
315 - Dad, you've been crushing things for five days straight.\\
316 - Have you even slept?\\
317 - That's the thing, Dewey.\\
318 - Ever since I got the steamroller,\\
319 - I don't have to sleep.\\
320 - It's like the laws of nature don't apply to me.\\
321 - What's this?\\
322 - Nothing. It's a brochure for a wrecking ball.\\
323 - It's not even mine, okay?\\
324 - I'm just holding it for a friend.\\
325 - Dad, I think you have a problem.\\
326 - Why can't everyone just leave me alone?!\\
327 - Check out this awesome story.\\
328 - So I thought I was going\\
329 - to borrow Reese's tuxedo T-shirt\\
330 - for the dance tonight, but then I saw one at the mall\\
331 - that said, "FBI-- Federal Booby Inspector."\\
332 - Federal Booby Inspector!\\
333 - Awesome.\\
334 - You... the man.\\
335 - Malcolm, I know I promised you the tuxedo shirt,\\
336 - but I saw this at the mall, and I think it's way better.\\
337 - Oh, my God!\\
338 - I was going to buy this after school!\\
339 - No way! Righteous!\\
340 - Whoa. Stevie, you got to let Reese head-butt you.\\
341 - It's like getting hit in the head\\
342 - with something really hard.\\
343 - Not... in this... lifetime.\\
344 - Your call.\\
345 - Maybe we'll do one later at the dance.\\
346 - Go... with you?\\
347 - Ha...\\
348 - ha...\\
349 - ha.\\
350 - Come on, Stevie.\\
351 - You got to come with us.\\
352 - We're like the Three Musketeers.\\
353 - You can't have the Three Musketeers without...\\
354 - what's his name.\\
355 - Nougat. Yeah, that dude.\\
356 - I'll be quilting.\\
357 - Fabrizzi's a master.\\
358 - The desert is practically alive.\\
359 - It looks like the dolphin and the tiger are dancing.\\
360 - Could I get this picture\\
361 - but with my husband's face where the dolphin is?\\
362 - Well, like all great artists,\\
363 - he'll do absolutely anything for money.\\
364 - Oh, my God!\\
365 - Francis, what happened?\\
366 - You are going to be so proud of me.\\
367 - I was putting gas in the van,\\
368 - and this guy walked out of the men's room.\\
369 - The sunscreen guy!\\
370 - And when I saw,\\
371 - it was like I became this wild animal.\\
372 - Like nature took over.\\
373 - I ran up to him and I blindsided him\\
374 - with the windshield-wiper squeegee,\\
375 - and his Big Gulp went flying\\
376 - and he was crying for his mother!\\
377 - Do you want to see his front tooth?\\
378 - You know what? I'm going to think about it\\
379 - and maybe come back another time.\\
380 - Why are you whistling?\\
381 - Honey, listen.\\
382 - I really want to hear about this,\\
383 - but I kind of told my boss I'm not trailer trash,\\
384 - and you're blowing my cover.\\
385 - These little cuts and bruises?\\
386 - These here are the symbols of my success.\\
387 - I mean, the guy took some convincing,\\
388 - but in the end,\\
389 - the money was cheerfully refunded.\\
390 - Is there supposed to be this much blood in my pocket?\\
391 - Okay, you're going to the emergency room.\\
392 -        \\
393 - Want some punch?\\
394 - If I say yes, you're just going to hit me.\\
395 - I'm going to hit you anyway,\\
396 - but it's funnier if you say yes first.\\
397 - So what do you like better,\\
398 - slow dancing or fast dancing?\\
399 - Slow dancing.\\
400 - Me, too.\\
401 - Unless the fast dance song, like, really rocks.\\
402 - Yeah.\\
403 - I can't believe the awesomeness\\
404 - of how awesome this is.\\
405 - At Cheswick Grounds, Britain's largest public lawn,\\
406 - each blade of grass is said to grow\\
407 - a full centimeter a day.\\
408 - Let's watch.\\
409 - Stevie, what are you doing here?\\
410 - I thought you're going to the dance with the boys.\\
411 - I didn't want... to go.\\
412 - Stevie, you listen to me.\\
413 - Just because you're in a wheelchair\\
414 - doesn't mean you can't enjoy a dance like anyone else.\\
415 - I think you are a fine young man with beautiful qualities\\
416 - that any girl would enjoy\\
417 - if you just put yourself out there.\\
418 - But... There are plenty of things you can do.\\
419 - You can snap your fingers to the beat.\\
420 - You can spin around in a circle.\\
421 - That would be adorable.\\
422 - Please... Stevie, any girl would be lucky\\
423 - to be your girlfriend.\\
424 - You're polite, you're considerate,\\
425 - and you are very clean.\\
426 - Girls go crazy for that.\\
427 - Lois... Stevie, you know what?\\
428 - We're going to that dance.\\
429 - Francis,\\
430 - what happened to you?\\
431 - Otto, I have to tell you something.\\
432 - There is no such thing as sunscreen for cows.\\
433 - What are you talking about?\\
434 - The guy, he was ripping you off.\\
435 - But don't worry, I took care of it.\\
436 - I got you your money back.\\
437 - Ugh! I am such an idiot.\\
438 - It is my fault you had to fight.\\
439 - I'm sorry. And thank you.\\
440 - It's okay.\\
441 - You know what?\\
442 - There is a man in my office right now,\\
443 - and I am suspicious of him, too.\\
444 - Come, you will meet him.\\
445 - Okay, show my friend here what you are selling me.\\
446 - This here's a magic stick. It finds water.\\
447 - Oh, yeah.\\
448 - I've seen these.\\
449 - It's got the good Swenson bevel on there.\\
450 - Yeah, these are great.\\
451 - I don't know.\\
452 - I guess I'd say I like curly fries better.\\
453 - Ha, I knew it.\\
454 - You totally owe me a buck, Malcolm.\\
455 - What about Cajun curly fries?\\
456 - Oh, my God!\\
457 - I completely forgot about those.\\
458 - Those  are my favorite.\\
459 - Mine, too.\\
460 - Why can't they make more foods curly?\\
461 - You guys are, like, the coolest brothers.\\
462 - I mean, you're both so easy to talk to.\\
463 - It's not like a strain or anything.\\
464 - Yeah, Reese and I get along awesome.\\
465 - It's 'cause you're so alike.\\
466 - You should totally check to make sure\\
467 - you're not, like, twins or something.\\
468 - I'll ask my mom when I get home.\\
469 - I just got a really good idea.\\
470 - I know this senior who's got some beer stashed.\\
471 - No way.\\
472 - We can grab a six pack and a blanket\\
473 - and go down to the football field.\\
474 - Awesome.\\
475 - I can't believe I'm about to do this.\\
476 - Underage drinking, making out with a girl\\
477 - where we're almost certain to get caught.\\
478 - High school rules!\\
479 - I am Hal!\\
480 - Oh... maybe just one row.\\
481 - Get away from here, son!\\
482 - I don't want you to see me like this!\\
483 - Dad, you have to stop!\\
484 - I can't!\\
485 - I'm proud of you, Dad.\\
486 - So what yard line do you want to sit on?\\
487 - 'Cause I was thinking the 50.\\
488 - But it's kind of a long walk.\\
489 - There's nothing to be nervous about, Stevie.\\
490 - I'll dance the first couple of dances with you.\\
491 - Hey, stop blaming yourself!\\
492 - That guy's a complete jerk.\\
493 - We're going to throw away his beer, get someone to take you home,\\
494 - and you should totally dump that guy.\\
495 - That's what I would have done\\
496 - if I hadn't shut off my brain all week.\\
497 - Here's what I really did.\\
498 -     Minty Mints are your breath's friend.    \\
499 - My mom said you asked for this.\\
500 - How's my gal?\\
501 - I don't know. She won't stop screaming.\\
502 - She hasn't even seen my report card yet.\\
503 - The way I figure it,\\
504 - I have to average an 8.0 just to break even.\\
505 - Which might be doable since I don't have distractions anymore.\\
506 - Alison dumped me as soon as I used the word "paradox"\\
507 - in a sentence.\\
508 - Welcome back.\\
509 - Sorry about Alison.\\
510 - It's no big deal.\\
511 - I'm still going to be seeing her around a lot.\\
512 - You know what I don't get about football?\\
513 - How come the away team has so many different uniforms?\\
514 - I don't know. Rich kids.\\
515 - Probably it.\\
516 - You want to make out? Do you? Sure.
\subsection {Episode 05: Forwards Backwards}
1 - And what do you think, Scott?\\
2 - Give Reese a slice from the fuzzy side,\\
3 - and I didn't see a thing.\\
4 - Deal.\\
5 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
6 -     I don't know    \\
7 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     Life is unfair.    \\
17 - That laptop is so sweet.\\
18 - I can't believe you're already upgrading it.\\
19 - Are you sure your dad will sell it to me for 300 bucks?\\
20 - Minus my... ten percent.\\
21 - Six months of tutoring kids\\
22 - who won't even take off their football helmets.\\
23 - Once I get\\
24 - my birthday money, I'll have it.\\
25 - You keep... your money... in a book?\\
26 - Yeah.\\
27 - It's the one place no one in my family will ever look.\\
28 - Have you seen your brother? He was supposed to...\\
29 - You...\\
30 - stupid... kid.\\
31 - You gave me\\
32 - a black eye, you jerk!\\
33 - You're going to pay for this.\\
34 - No one is paying for anything.\\
35 - You are going to drop this.\\
36 - Ow!\\
37 - I'm sick of you two fighting,\\
38 - and you at least should know better.\\
39 - Your birthday is coming up.\\
40 - I only want money.\\
41 - If you want anything, you will not retaliate.\\
42 - I don't care who started it. It ends with you.\\
43 - But he... With you!\\
44 - You're just going to let him have the last licks?\\
45 - Yes, I am.\\
46 - Now, get out of my sight, both of you.\\
47 - Well... handled.\\
48 - Fighting like that right in front of me.\\
49 - What could possibly have possessed those two boys?\\
50 - Help me!\\
51 - Help me.\\
52 - Oh, I'll help you.\\
53 - Hello, there.\\
54 - Hello.\\
55 - It's my son's birthday,\\
56 - and I wanted to buy him a comic book.\\
57 - He only wanted money,\\
58 - but he really loves this stuff\\
59 - and it just doesn't seem like a birthday\\
60 - if there's nothing to open.\\
61 - Do you work here?\\
62 - I have the conn.\\
63 - Oh, great.\\
64 - So, uh, do you have any suggestions?\\
65 - You know, something nice, like, $20?\\
66 - Well, if you're looking for\\
67 - a $20 comic book,\\
68 - you're in the league for Mr. Incredible.\\
69 - I don't think he's ready for that.\\
70 - And for only $20?\\
71 - Have you lost your mind? Hey!\\
72 - You guys shut up. No. Tell me about him.\\
73 - Oh, well, he's incredible.\\
74 - He's a rock star by day and superhero by night.\\
75 - He can shoot flames out of his eyes\\
76 - and melt his enemy's brains with his mind.\\
77 - Yeah. I think I read that one.\\
78 - Sir, there is no Mr. Incredible.\\
79 - Well, then-then, why...\\
80 - Sir, the Middle Earthling is for clientele\\
81 - sophisticated enough to appreciate\\
82 - cinematic drawing and nonlinear storytelling.\\
83 - And I can see by your office drone shirt\\
84 - that you're not a serious graphic novel collector.\\
85 - Is the new Metamorpho in?\\
86 - Yes, Ricky, right away. Well, wait.\\
87 - Hey, I was... Excuse me...\\
88 - I'm helping a customer.\\
89 - Is that for my costume?\\
90 - What costume?\\
91 - The school play.\\
92 - I'm in the school play!\\
93 - Oh, right.\\
94 - You're a... tree?\\
95 - I'm Abraham Lincoln!\\
96 - I'm reciting\\
97 - the Gettysburg Address.\\
98 - Why do always do this to me?\\
99 - Oh, calm down.\\
100 - I always pull it together, don't I?\\
101 - Remember that great Frankenstein costume I made\\
102 - that everybody loved?\\
103 - Yeah.\\
104 - Can we use that again?\\
105 - Hey, Otto, I think we have some vandals or something.\\
106 - There's more fences down,\\
107 - and this time some chickens were killed.\\
108 - It almost looks like they were stomped to death.\\
109 - La vaca diablo...\\
110 - ...ha regresado.\\
111 - It was only the wind.\\
112 - But the chickens look like they exploded.\\
113 - Well, obviously, the broken fences flew\\
114 - to the other side of the ranch,\\
115 - hitting the chickens in a slamming motion\\
116 - and dragging them across the ground in a manner\\
117 - that closely resembles stomping.\\
118 - You see, there is\\
119 - a perfectly logical explanation for everything.\\
120 -   La vaca diablo!\\
121 - Fue asi la vaca diablo!\\
122 - Perfectly logical.\\
123 - Was he saying "Devil cow"?\\
124 - Ah, it is a silly legend.\\
125 - Many years ago they say\\
126 - there was a cow who one day tasted human flesh\\
127 - and went bad.\\
128 - And now whenever the moon is red,\\
129 - she comes down from a mountain lair\\
130 - to drink the blood of the innocent.\\
131 - You're talking about a cow.\\
132 - Yeah, I know. Silly, isn't it?\\
133 - Oh...\\
134 - Wake up.\\
135 - What do  you  want?\\
136 - I just want to let you know you're not getting last licks.\\
137 - Huh? I'm sick of you always\\
138 - having an edge just 'cause you're an idiot\\
139 - and I'm smart and understand about consequences.\\
140 - I can be just as vicious and shortsighted as you.\\
141 - Oh, yeah.\\
142 - I'm really scared.\\
143 - Why don't you just...?\\
144 - What did you do?\\
145 - I sunk to  your  level.\\
146 - And I have to say... it feels good.\\
147 - How did comic book shopping go?\\
148 - Bad.\\
149 - I'm just out of my depth.\\
150 - Look, we both hoped it wouldn't come to this,\\
151 - but you know what we have to do.\\
152 - Hal, we promised ourselves we wouldn't.\\
153 - What other choice do we have?\\
154 - Isn't this interesting?\\
155 - Once more, I'm the only person that can help you.\\
156 - I'm your best friend when you need someone\\
157 - to pick up your mail or sit on a suitcase,\\
158 - but when it's time for a barbecue,\\
159 - I have to watch from the car.\\
160 - I got to tell you, Hal,\\
161 - this beer is tasting mighty bitter.\\
162 - I'll take another.\\
163 - Are you going to help me or not?\\
164 - I will help you.\\
165 - But one day-- and that day may never come--\\
166 - I will ask you to perform a service for me.\\
167 - Actually, it'll be tomorrow.\\
168 - I'll be here about 10:00,\\
169 - and if it's nice, wear a bathing suit.\\
170 - What?\\
171 - What happened?\\
172 - It's horrible.\\
173 - What, the rug?\\
174 - That's no rug.\\
175 - It's an... antelope.\\
176 - Oh, my God!\\
177 - It's been completely flattened.\\
178 - Look. There's pieces in the tree.\\
179 - What could have done something like this?\\
180 - It-It was me.\\
181 - You? Yeah.\\
182 - On-on my moped.\\
183 - A-A terrible accident.\\
184 - It was dark.\\
185 - It jumped right in front of me.\\
186 - I had perhaps\\
187 - a few too many Cajun martinis.\\
188 - That should be a lesson to all of us, hey?\\
189 - Go get a shovel and some sawdust.\\
190 - Okay, hold still.\\
191 - I don't think I want to be in this play.\\
192 - Now, I've been doing some reading,\\
193 - and this Lincoln person wasn't such a great guy.\\
194 - Did you know that the Emancipation Proclamation\\
195 - wasn't about slavery at all?\\
196 - It was strictly a political move.\\
197 - Honey, you're just nervous\\
198 - 'cause you've never had a part with lines before.\\
199 - Or where you move.\\
200 - For the love of God!\\
201 - He suspended the writ of habeas corpus in Maryland!\\
202 - You should have seen Reese. It was hysterical.\\
203 - Are you sure... you want...\\
204 - to push him?\\
205 - It's the only way to get through\\
206 - to his primitive little monkey brain.\\
207 - He has to know that I'm not going to back down.\\
208 - What is this?\\
209 - Oh, my God!\\
210 - If you can be vicious,\\
211 - I can be smart.\\
212 - How many copies did you make?\\
213 - I don't know.\\
214 - How many copies are there in a pack of 500 sheets?\\
215 - This is over, Reese.\\
216 - I don't know why you're so upset.\\
217 - Look at you going like a big boy.\\
218 - All right, two scoops, fudge ripple.\\
219 - Now  are we going to the comic book store?\\
220 - Patience, Luke. You are reckless.\\
221 - We've gone to the beach, we've gone to the movies.\\
222 - I won you an animal at the church bazaar.\\
223 - We've gone out for coffee, lunch, Slushees, pie.\\
224 - I can't negotiate unless I'm firing on all cylinders.\\
225 - Just have many cylinders do you have?\\
226 - Pull over.\\
227 - No, you're right. I'm sorry.\\
228 - That was uncalled for.\\
229 - Pull over.\\
230 - Craig, I am not pulling over.\\
231 - Just let me out of the car.\\
232 - Craig, I am not stopping this car.\\
233 - All right, all right!\\
234 - Calm down.\\
235 - You are going to have to learn\\
236 - how to get along without Craig Feldspar.\\
237 - My ducky.\\
238 - Hey.\\
239 - Get out of here. I'm busy.\\
240 - I'll be quick.\\
241 - You know, while I was ripping down all those flyers,\\
242 - I was racking my brain trying to come up\\
243 - with some way to get back at you.\\
244 - And I began to wonder.\\
245 - What's the point?\\
246 - No matter how hard I try, nothing ever stops you.\\
247 - Maybe you're just better at this than I am.\\
248 - Well, yeah. Then again,\\
249 - maybe we should ask your friends what they think.\\
250 - What?\\
251 - Your friends.\\
252 - These are friends, aren't they?\\
253 - You're always hanging out\\
254 - with them or near them anyway.\\
255 - Hey, do any of you know this kid's name?\\
256 - This kid right here.\\
257 - Do any of you know his name?\\
258 - But he's always following you around.\\
259 - You never noticed him before?\\
260 - So he's been sitting right next to you for months\\
261 - just pretending to be your friend?\\
262 - Wow. That's sad.\\
263 - Well, uh, his name's Reese.\\
264 - And guess what? I'm better than you.\\
265 - I win. It's over.\\
266 -        \\
267 - Gretchen?\\
268 - Gretchen, I...\\
269 - Whoa, uh!\\
270 - Otto, what? I have seen it, Francis!\\
271 - The devil cow!\\
272 - It had eyes like burning embers\\
273 - and breath from the bowels of hell!\\
274 - Oh, it was horrible.\\
275 - More horrible than this?\\
276 - We must leave this place.\\
277 - Burn it down.\\
278 - Start over.\\
279 - Yeah.\\
280 - No. Enough is enough.\\
281 - We're not running away from a cow.\\
282 - We're not?\\
283 - No. We're not.\\
284 - From now on...\\
285 - I'm lactose intolerant.\\
286 - Okay, Dewey, here's your costume.\\
287 - Now, your father and I\\
288 - will see you at the show this afternoon.\\
289 - I'm going to throw up.\\
290 - What if I forget my part?\\
291 - What if something flies out of my nose\\
292 - like it did at show and tell?\\
293 - Dewey, I'm going to let you in on a little secret.\\
294 - When you're up on that stage,\\
295 - all you have to do is look out in the front row.\\
296 - Your father and I will be sitting there,\\
297 - and you just look me in the eyes and you'll know\\
298 - that everything's going to be all right, okay?\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - And if you still feel like throwing up,\\
301 - use the hat.\\
302 - Reese totally had that coming.\\
303 - I'm not... arguing.\\
304 - Seriously, humiliation is the only thing\\
305 - that jerk understands.\\
306 - Fine.\\
307 - Why are you taking  his  side?!\\
308 - Ooh, a birthday card.\\
309 - Five dollars Canadian.\\
310 - Pretty good for Grandma.\\
311 - So, I'll have the rest of my birthday money on Saturday,\\
312 - so I can give you the 300 bucks for the computer when...\\
313 - "Dear Malcolm, Ha-ha.\\
314 - "Now I win.\\
315 - Your  friend,  Reese."\\
316 - They'll try you...\\
317 - as an adult!\\
318 - Uh, yes, I'm looking for a serious graphic novel\\
319 - with cinematic drawings\\
320 - and neat, linear storytelling.\\
321 - Weren't you in here the other day?\\
322 - No, I...\\
323 - Okay, look.\\
324 - I just want to buy a present for my son, okay?\\
325 - I don't think that's a crime.\\
326 - As I see it, my only crime is not knowing as much as you.\\
327 - Look, you all have parents, don't you?\\
328 - I am appealing to you as decent human beings\\
329 - to help me give my son a happy birthday.\\
330 - Hey, man, I'm sorry.\\
331 - I guess we did kind of get off on the wrong foot.\\
332 - We all got to start somewhere.\\
333 - This one's called Dead Man's Shoes.\\
334 - It's 50 bucks.\\
335 - It's all about alienation.\\
336 - I think your son will really like it.\\
337 - Thank you.\\
338 - Not so fast.\\
339 - This transaction does not concern you, Feldspar.\\
340 - It's Craig Feldspar.\\
341 - He's a level 45 Dungeon Master.\\
342 - What cereal box did you shake this out of, Dean?\\
343 - It's the first print. It's totally collectable.\\
344 - Oh. Should we check the Overstreet?\\
345 - Wait, we don't have to.\\
346 - 1997-- first and only printing.\\
347 - 50,000 returns, all in circulation.\\
348 - I'd keep this in my bathroom,\\
349 - but not for reading.\\
350 - This isn't a comic book store.\\
351 - It's a novelty shop!\\
352 - Oh, really?\\
353 - Well, I'd like to see the novelty shop\\
354 - that carries an original Spider-Man  number 14\\
355 - with the first appearance of the Green Goblin.\\
356 - You're kidding.\\
357 - If you changed to a more respectful tone,\\
358 - I just might let...\\
359 - What are you doing?!\\
360 - Fear not.\\
361 - It's the 1993 reprint.\\
362 - If it had been an original,\\
363 - he would have thrown himself in front of it.\\
364 - Dude, you told me that was real.\\
365 - Now...\\
366 - let's talk business.\\
367 - Craig, I can't thank you enough.\\
368 - That was fantastic!\\
369 - You were so heroic.\\
370 - I like to think we all have\\
371 - a little bit of Aquaman right here.\\
372 - Well, I must say, you really know your stuff.\\
373 - I'm impressed.\\
374 - Well, you know... if you're interested,\\
375 - there is a convention next Saturday.\\
376 - I have a life, Craig.\\
377 - Car number 15, no bumping.\\
378 - Return to the pit area.\\
379 - What the hell are you doing?!\\
380 - You had no right!\\
381 - You stole from me! That was my money!\\
382 - Fine. Let's see.\\
383 - I've done 63 laps.\\
384 - Keep the change!\\
385 - Car eight, let's be courteous.\\
386 - It ends here, Reese!\\
387 - I don't care about the money!\\
388 - I don't care about my birthday!\\
389 - I don't care about your safety or mine!\\
390 - I don't care about anything except making you suffer!\\
391 - Well, I don't care either!\\
392 - Fine! Let's see who cares the least the most!\\
393 - Okay, you just lost\\
394 - two weeks arcade privileges.\\
395 - This is a game of chicken Reese is not going to win!\\
396 - I'm too angry to blink! When he sees my face,\\
397 - he's going to know he doesn't have a chance!\\
398 -     He's off and flying as he guns the car around the track    \\
399 -     He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back    \\
400 -     Adventure's waiting just ahead...    \\
401 - He'll stop.\\
402 - I know he'll stop.\\
403 - Maybe this wasn't such a good...\\
404 - Ugh!\\
405 - I should have told the doctor\\
406 - to sew fur and tails on you boys\\
407 - because you're animals!\\
408 - Only, animals would be easier\\
409 - 'cause then I could have you fixed.\\
410 - For all the good it does, you're grounded, again.\\
411 - Thanks for getting me grounded on my birthday.\\
412 - Oh, boo-hoo, I was grounded on my birthday.\\
413 - I was just standing up for myself.\\
414 - There is such a thing as justice, you know!\\
415 - Well, there is such a thing as "shut up!"\\
416 - Stop it.\\
417 - Malcolm, do you remember\\
418 - what you did for your birthday last year?\\
419 - Nothing. I was grounded then, too.\\
420 - And what about your birthday?\\
421 - You grounded me after\\
422 - I smashed Malcolm's face into the cake.\\
423 - And your birthday before that?\\
424 - Pretty much this.\\
425 - Wait.\\
426 - When did you push me off the pony?\\
427 - Do you realize that neither of you\\
428 - has had a birthday party in his entire life?\\
429 - Don't you think that's sad?\\
430 - Every chance you have had for a little happiness--\\
431 - a little something special-- you threw it away.\\
432 - At some point, this has to stop.\\
433 - Is revenge ever worth it?\\
434 - Is it worth it now?\\
435 - Do you feel happy?\\
436 - There's no reason to compete with each other.\\
437 - We love you both the same.\\
438 - There are no favorites in this family.\\
439 - Where  is  Dewey?\\
440 - I said, there's Mr. Lincoln now.\\
441 - We love you, Dewey.\\
442 - You can do it, son.\\
443 - We're so proud of you.\\
444 -     Fourscore and seven years ago    \\
445 -     Our fathers brought forth    \\
446 -     Unto this continent    \\
447 -     A new nation    \\
448 -     Conceived in liberty    \\
449 -     And dedicated to the proposition...    \\
450 -     By the people, for the people    \\
451 -     Shall not perish from this Earth.    \\
452 - You know, Daniela could do that, too,\\
453 - if your affair hadn't scarred her for life.\\
454 - Oh, bravo.\\
455 - Why don't you have another drink?\\
456 - Francis, this is not the time to study animal husbandry.\\
457 - We have a cow to kill.\\
458 - There's got to be something in here that can help us.\\
459 - You know what will help us? The bullet.\\
460 - The bullet is always the answer.\\
461 - Oh, my God, it is here!\\
462 - That's it!\\
463 - I know what we have to do!\\
464 - Ah! Oh! Francis! Oof!\\
465 - Oof!\\
466 - Oh...\\
467 - No, please, please,\\
468 - no!\\
469 - No!\\
470 - All right, Bessie,\\
471 - you've been causing a lot of trouble,\\
472 - and it stops now.\\
473 - You are going to be milked.\\
474 - There you go.\\
475 - You been up in those mountains so long all engorged,\\
476 - no wonder you were so angry.\\
477 - You're not evil at all.\\
478 - You're just a lady with a little too much milk.\\
479 - Well, this new game is good,\\
480 - but it doesn't quite buy me off.\\
481 - You still didn't come to my play.\\
482 - Well, how would you like Malcolm's comic book, hmm?\\
483 - I'm starting to get over it.\\
484 - Happy birthday, Malcolm.\\
485 - Thanks.\\
486 - Don't eat that blueberry.\\
487 - I'm saving it.\\
488 - What's the worst that can happen?
\subsection {Episode 06: Forbidden Girlfriend}
1 - That's a doggone good deal.\\
2 - And now here's Chip with the weather.\\
3 - Bad news, folks.\\
4 - Looks like the downpour is going to continue through the weekend.\\
5 - Up to two inches of rainfall...\\
6 - It's not raining.\\
7 - Don't forget those umbrellas and galoshes...\\
8 - ...and the three unidentified boys\\
9 - fled the scene on foot as hundreds of helpless spectators\\
10 - could only look on in horror.\\
11 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
12 -     I don't know    \\
13 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     And you're not so big    \\
22 -     Life is unfair.    \\
23 - It's amazing all the different kinds of kids\\
24 - you meet when you're tutoring after school.\\
25 - In the last six weeks alone,\\
26 - I've met morons, idiots, lunkheads, jackasses\\
27 - and one imbecile.\\
28 - My mom's making me do a job where I use my brain.\\
29 - I'll tell you one thing.\\
30 - When I have kids...\\
31 - they're really going to suffer.\\
32 - Stupid job. I spend my free time trying to teach...\\
33 - You're Nicki?\\
34 - Hi.\\
35 - This doesn't make her right.\\
36 -        \\
37 -     Lock you inside, every day and every night    \\
38 -     Oh, girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control    \\
39 -     Can't you see I'm trying to show    \\
40 -     Love is all right?    \\
41 -     Oh, show and tell    \\
42 -     Just a game I play, when I want to say...    \\
43 - Boys will be home in ten minutes.\\
44 - I'm willing to accept that challenge.\\
45 - No, Hal.\\
46 - I just went to the doctor.\\
47 - I have a low-grade infection.\\
48 - I have to take antibiotics.\\
49 - And...\\
50 - we can't have sex for a week.\\
51 - What?\\
52 - Not until I finish these.\\
53 - Okay, okay, let's try to look at this rationally.\\
54 - What would happen if you took them all at once?\\
55 - No, Hal.\\
56 - Or, or... what if we alternated?\\
57 - One day off, one day on.\\
58 - I'm not a medical doctor, but I think it would be\\
59 - a lot less of a shock to your system.\\
60 - A week, Hal.\\
61 - No sex for a week.\\
62 - Wow!\\
63 - All right, I'm fine.\\
64 - I'll just... uh...\\
65 - I'll go mow the lawn.\\
66 - Do we still have that mower?\\
67 - Hal? Huh?\\
68 - Clothes.\\
69 - Oh, right.\\
70 -        \\
71 - Hey, watch where you're driving, you butt-wipe!\\
72 - What'd you say?\\
73 - Nothing.\\
74 - Better watch yourself, jerk-wad.\\
75 - I'll kick your butt.\\
76 - Yeah, well, I wish I had a car like that!\\
77 - Thank you so much for the work that you did last week.\\
78 - Now, I insist that you take this.\\
79 - Thank you.\\
80 - What work did you do last week?\\
81 - Young man, nice job with those weeds yesterday.\\
82 - Is five dollars okay?\\
83 - Okay. Thank you.\\
84 - No way, you didn't pull any weeds yesterday.\\
85 - I know. What's going on?\\
86 - It's money day. Money day?\\
87 - Yeah. I don't know why, but it's been happening a lot lately.\\
88 - Dewey, people don't have money days.\\
89 - I do. It's really neat.\\
90 - There's also cookie days and pat on the head days.\\
91 - I don't like those so much,\\
92 - but before you know it, it's money day again.\\
93 - What do you think you're doing?\\
94 - Putting this stupid fence back up\\
95 - for the third time this month.\\
96 - Well, me and Earl went to a lot of trouble tearing it down.\\
97 - What? Why would you tear our fence down?\\
98 - We've got 300 head of cattle we got to get to water.\\
99 - They got to come through here to get to the wash.\\
100 - We need this fence.\\
101 - We had two horses wander off.\\
102 - It took us a week to find them.\\
103 - Our ranch has used this trail for over 50 years.\\
104 - We're not about to stop\\
105 - for a bunch of city boys playing horsy!\\
106 - Look, just because it's a dude ranch\\
107 - doesn't mean I don't bust my ass the same as you.\\
108 - Hey, cowboy, your fanny pack's ringing.\\
109 - Talk to me.\\
110 - The lavender soap should be next to the potpourri.\\
111 - Well, did you check with housekeeping?\\
112 - I'm finally starting to understand trigonometry.\\
113 - Yeah?\\
114 - It's useless.\\
115 - Come on, you need trigonometry.\\
116 - Say you want to plot the orbit of a lunar...\\
117 - You're right, it's useless.\\
118 - I've noticed you at school.\\
119 - You have?\\
120 - In fact, I've been thinking about you... a lot.\\
121 - I heard it, too!\\
122 - Really?\\
123 - I know you're super smart, so here's my question:\\
124 - with a brain like that,\\
125 - do you plan, like, every moment in your life?\\
126 - No, I don't think... You do. I know you do.\\
127 - You always have to know what's going to happen next, don't you?\\
128 - Don't you? No.\\
129 - I really like not knowing what's going to happen next.\\
130 - I mean, even when it's scary.\\
131 - In fact,\\
132 - I kind of like it when it's scary.\\
133 - You know, like right now,\\
134 - I don't know\\
135 - what's going to happen next.\\
136 - Do you?\\
137 - Well...\\
138 - You getting anywhere?\\
139 - What?\\
140 - The math.\\
141 - The thing I'm paying you $6 an hour for.\\
142 - Oh, yeah, she's really smart.\\
143 - She didn't get it when I tried to explain it.\\
144 - You didn't try to explain it, you just yelled it at me.\\
145 - He dropped out of high school,\\
146 - so whenever anything makes him feel small, he yells.\\
147 - I'm sure you could've learned\\
148 - trigonometry if you wanted to.\\
149 - When?\\
150 - When I was in 'Nam, tied to a Punjab stick,\\
151 - chin deep in a tiger cage in the Mekong River?\\
152 - No, I guess not.\\
153 - Just remember something, hotshot.\\
154 - Me and a lot of my dead comrades put our asses on the line\\
155 - so you and your little friends\\
156 - could have the freedom to study trigonometry.\\
157 - Thank you... sir.\\
158 - That was scary.\\
159 - Oh, please, he plays that card all the time.\\
160 - Last week, he tried to use it\\
161 - to get a free Grand Slam at Denny's.\\
162 - I think we should get back to math.\\
163 - Or you could stop stalling and kiss me.\\
164 - Kiss you?\\
165 - Okay, you're obviously crazy. Your dad's, like, 12 feet away.\\
166 - Yeah? You're just trying\\
167 - to create a situation where he catches me\\
168 - and I get my butt kicked. Well, I'm not...\\
169 - Hey, morning, Reese. How's it going?\\
170 - What are you doing up?\\
171 - Well, I was just lying in bed this morning\\
172 - staring at the ceiling, and I thought,\\
173 - "Why don't I paint the kitchen cabinets?"\\
174 - Oh, I made crepes.\\
175 - Crepes? Uh-huh.\\
176 - Come on, sit down.\\
177 - Look, I've got strawberries,\\
178 - bananas, peaches, drawn butter, maple syrup, you name it.\\
179 - Dig in.\\
180 - Hey, honey, where have you been?\\
181 - I was up at 4:00 scouring the grout in the shower\\
182 - and I thought, "The flower market is open this early.\\
183 - Why not drive downtown and buy us some fresh-cut flowers?"\\
184 - They're beautiful! Crepes?\\
185 - Can't, got to make\\
186 - the boys' lunches.\\
187 - I've already made them lunch.\\
188 - Oh, well, double lunches.\\
189 - That was so much fun last night.\\
190 - When I got home, my mom yelled at me for an hour,\\
191 - but I didn't care.\\
192 - I know. My dad went nuts.\\
193 - I got two veins and the temple thing.\\
194 - We get it.\\
195 - You're dating.\\
196 - Stevie, how's it going?\\
197 - Good.\\
198 - Do you know...\\
199 - How cute you are? Yes, so what?\\
200 - Stop bragging about it.\\
201 - I was...\\
202 - going to ask...\\
203 - If I would dump Malcolm for you.\\
204 - Well, yeah, but you can't ask me right in front of him.\\
205 - He has feelings.\\
206 - ...if you passed...\\
207 - your trig test...\\
208 - Oh, yeah, D minus.\\
209 - Thank you, baby.\\
210 - All right, I'm sick of school, let's go to the mall.\\
211 - Ditch?\\
212 - Yeah, it's just P.E.\\
213 - But that's... a class.\\
214 - And it'll be there tomorrow. Come on.\\
215 - Why... pretend?\\
216 - You're right.\\
217 - Four times we have to put up this fence!\\
218 - Do they think we are not serious?\\
219 - Maybe you should talk to them. Talk to those idiots? No!\\
220 - Do they think creating wholesome entertainment for families\\
221 - is for sissies?\\
222 - There's arts and crafts,\\
223 - there's nature hikes, there's costume parties.\\
224 - Let them try to keep track\\
225 - of what is what on Opposites Day.\\
226 - Ooh, they will\\
227 - pay for this.\\
228 - Woo-hoo!\\
229 - Lunchtime.\\
230 - Oh, Gretchen,\\
231 - I did not mean for you to see me in my fury.\\
232 - Otto, I love your fury.\\
233 - Isn't Otto's fury magnificent, Francis?\\
234 - I try not to look at his fury.\\
235 - If they tear this one down,\\
236 - we will make them suffer as they have never suffered.\\
237 - Or, we might consider trying to reach a compromise.\\
238 - Do I look French to you? No!\\
239 - If it is a range war they want, then by gosh, they will get one.\\
240 - They do not know what they are up against.\\
241 - Nice job, son.\\
242 - Thanks. Wait a minute.\\
243 - Why are you giving him five bucks?\\
244 - Why?\\
245 - This young man cleaned out my gutters,\\
246 - he sorted my recyclables, and I didn't even ask him to.\\
247 - You couldn't find a nicer kid.\\
248 - I wish I could give him more.\\
249 - Don't worry about it.\\
250 - It can't be money day.\\
251 - There is no money day.\\
252 - I would know about it if there was a money day.\\
253 - Unless...\\
254 - maybe Mom and Dad don't want me knowing about money day.\\
255 - Excuse me.\\
256 - Beat it, kid, I'm trying to figure something out.\\
257 - Okay. Sorry.\\
258 - I'll just rake around you.\\
259 - His name is Billy Prescott.\\
260 - I followed him home.\\
261 - He lives, like, a mile away from here.\\
262 - He looks exactly like you.\\
263 - You're lying. Am I?\\
264 - It's common knowledge, Dewey,\\
265 - that every person on this planet has an evil twin.\\
266 - He's my evil twin?\\
267 - Fat chance.\\
268 - The guy's a saint.\\
269 - You're his evil twin.\\
270 - But I don't want to be an evil twin.\\
271 - I don't make the rules, Dewey.\\
272 - Besides, we've been given a golden opportunity here.\\
273 - To do what?\\
274 - I don't know yet,\\
275 - but there's money and an evil twin.\\
276 - If we can't figure out how to make this pay off,\\
277 - there is something deeply wrong with us.\\
278 - Come on, let's go watch some soap operas.\\
279 - Things are going great with Nicki.\\
280 - We've gone to the planetarium, miniature golf, the movies...\\
281 - It's amazing how uncrowded stuff is during school hours.\\
282 - You know what? I'd better get home. I'm grounded.\\
283 - You're grounded? Why didn't you tell me?\\
284 - When my dad found out that I cut English, he flipped out.\\
285 - You know what's funny?\\
286 - He thinks  you're a bad influence on  me.\\
287 - That is hilarious. Listen, Nicki...\\
288 - He really doesn't like you. Why? What's wrong with me?\\
289 - I never did anything to him.\\
290 - Everybody doesn't have to like you, Malcolm.\\
291 - I know, but... I like you,\\
292 - and a lot of people would think that's enough.\\
293 - Get your\\
294 - filthy mouth off of my daughter's face!\\
295 - Get in the truck.\\
296 - What are you doing? You're supposed to be at work!\\
297 - Okay, hotshot,\\
298 - consider this your one and only warning.\\
299 - You are never, ever\\
300 - to see my daughter again, you got that?!\\
301 - No, Daddy, take it back!\\
302 - Take it back!\\
303 - I cannot believe that you would come to the park\\
304 - and you would do this to me.\\
305 - Do you know how embarrassing you are?\\
306 - I'm okay... I'm okay.\\
307 - I'm just going to lie down here for a minute.\\
308 - Hey, honey.\\
309 - Oh, I had a great day.\\
310 - You know, I was working through lunch,\\
311 - and Mr. Collins came by\\
312 - and he started asking me about what I was doing...\\
313 - I think I'm getting a raise!\\
314 - Hal, that's wonderful.\\
315 - I had a good day myself.\\
316 - After I finished washing the windows\\
317 - and stripping the floors,\\
318 - I went over our tax returns for the last seven years.\\
319 - We overpaid in '99.\\
320 - You're kidding.\\
321 - $800.\\
322 - The IRS is sending us a check.\\
323 - Wow! Honey, great job!\\
324 - You know, I got to tell you, I think...\\
325 - Is that the last one?\\
326 - Mm-hmm.\\
327 - So we can...\\
328 - I guess so.\\
329 - Great.\\
330 - Hey.\\
331 - Stop! I talked to Nicki's father\\
332 - and he told me what happened.\\
333 - You are forbidden from seeing that girl again.\\
334 - Mom... Forbidden!\\
335 - I told him you wouldn't\\
336 - give him any more trouble, understood?\\
337 - Don't worry. The guy's a psycho.\\
338 - And I think she is, too.\\
339 - I'm totally never seeing her again.\\
340 - Good morning. Hi.\\
341 - Last night was great.\\
342 - Yeah. Okay, I get home at 3:00 today.\\
343 - Dad gets home at 6:00.\\
344 - Now, my little brother is a total narc,\\
345 - but we can send him to the arcade till, like, 4:00.\\
346 - So we have... No good.\\
347 - I've got a chem lab until, like, 3:30 on Wednesdays.\\
348 - What about tomorrow?\\
349 - No good. I can't wait till tomorrow.\\
350 - We got to think of some...\\
351 - What?\\
352 - You can't wait till tomorrow?\\
353 - Shut up.\\
354 - Okay, we'll do it today and we'll slide it an hour.\\
355 - That's cutting it pretty close, but I'll make it work.\\
356 - We can make this work.\\
357 - Dad. Oh.\\
358 - See you in math.\\
359 - Okay.\\
360 - I might need to see the nurse first.\\
361 - I don't want to do this.\\
362 - If you don't do it,\\
363 - I'm going to tell Mom about you taking all that money.\\
364 - And you're going to get a "me" punishment.\\
365 - Now get to work!\\
366 - Hey!\\
367 - What are you doing?!\\
368 - Yeah, you better run, Billy Prescott!\\
369 - All the way to 1515 Cypress Street,\\
370 - a block west of Halifax.\\
371 - I'm glad that we decided not to, uh...\\
372 - Absolutely.\\
373 - Every other aspect of our lives is getting so much attention.\\
374 - Our lives are so much better.\\
375 - Do you think that's how really successful people just...?\\
376 - Can't think of any other explanation.\\
377 - No. So Bill Gates...?\\
378 - Probably never.\\
379 - I started an herb garden in the backyard today.\\
380 - Did you know we had a potting shed?\\
381 - You're kidding.\\
382 - Oh, we are definitely doing the right thing.\\
383 - I'll go sleep in the car.\\
384 - Park it a couple blocks away.\\
385 - This one is...\\
386 - Ooh, be careful! It might bite through!\\
387 - We have had some good ones in the past, Francis,\\
388 - but this may be the best pirate night ever.\\
389 - What are you doing?!\\
390 - Easy, Otto.\\
391 - What do you think\\
392 - you are doing?\\
393 - We have a real ranch to run,\\
394 - and our cattle need water.\\
395 - We need that fence.\\
396 - I will not allow you to kill our horses.\\
397 - Well, I'm not going to allow you to kill our cattle!\\
398 - Enough talk.\\
399 - Gretchen, my gun!\\
400 - Which one?\\
401 - Ooh, what am I saying?\\
402 - The Luger, hmm?\\
403 - Otto, this is nuts.\\
404 - You will see you are not dealing with a fool.\\
405 - That fence is going up twice as high!\\
406 - We'll just tear it back down again.\\
407 - Then we will build another fence 50 feet high!\\
408 - Every time you build it up, we'll tear it down.\\
409 - Every time you tear it down, we will build it up!\\
410 - Um, did it ever occur to anyone to put in a gate?\\
411 - A gate?\\
412 - Hmm.\\
413 - A gate would work.\\
414 -     Shave his belly with a rusty razor    \\
415 -     Earl-aye in the morning    \\
416 -     Keep an eye on your lonely bunkmate    \\
417 -     Keep an eye on your lonely bunkmate...    \\
418 - Sorry.\\
419 - I jumped in a line at the mall to ditch my Dad,\\
420 - and I ended up giving blood at the Red Cross.\\
421 - I told my Mom I was going to the library tomorrow.\\
422 - No, we  are  going to the library.\\
423 - I thought we were going to the church fair.\\
424 - No, the church fair is next week.\\
425 - It's just a cover so we can meet at the lake.\\
426 - I thought the lake was a cover for the bowling alley.\\
427 - No, I'm supposed to be at the bowling alley right now.\\
428 - This is crazy.\\
429 - I know. Maybe it'll get crazier.\\
430 - Oh, my God, my Dad!\\
431 - You said you were going\\
432 - to the bowling alley!\\
433 - I changed my mind!\\
434 - And why are you following me?\\
435 - Don't you trust me? Shh!\\
436 - Don't you shush me!\\
437 - You'll learn to shush\\
438 - when someone is shoving bamboo splinters\\
439 - under your fingernails trying to get you\\
440 - to rat out your company!\\
441 - This is worth it.\\
442 - This is definitely worth it.\\
443 - For the love of God.\\
444 - Man, filling up that guy's car with cement\\
445 - was a stroke of genius.\\
446 - With Billy Prescott as our fall guy,\\
447 - we can do anything.\\
448 - Now, I've updated my enemies list.\\
449 - Dewey?\\
450 - Dewey, I'm talking to you.\\
451 - Have you heard enough?\\
452 - Oh, yeah.\\
453 - Okay, now I know what you're thinking.\\
454 - But the thing that you don't realize\\
455 - is that... that I'm not the real Reese.\\
456 - I just look like me... him.\\
457 - But if-if you hurt us...\\
458 - I-I mean him...\\
459 - Oh, just go ahead.\\
460 - Now that I've finished the carpet,\\
461 - we can insulate the attic.\\
462 - I'm telling you, honey,\\
463 - the value of this house is going to triple.\\
464 - We can retire early.\\
465 - Lois,\\
466 - what have you planned?\\
467 - Nothing.\\
468 - Lois, we made an agreement.\\
469 - Mm-hmm.\\
470 - Okay, okay.\\
471 - You know, two have to play at this game,\\
472 - and I'm not playing.\\
473 - I am just not playing!\\
474 - So you think that's going to work?\\
475 - Well, I've got news for you, girlie girl.\\
476 - I am made of sterner stuff.\\
477 - I happen to like my new life,\\
478 - and I am not about to descend to your animal level.\\
479 - Tool belt on.\\
480 - I've had it up to here with your sneaking around.\\
481 - You're never where you say you're going to be.\\
482 - You can't play me for a fool, Nicki!\\
483 - Dad, you are being paranoid!\\
484 - There is nothing going on\\
485 - outside of your stupid, little twisted head.\\
486 - Well, if I find out you've been lying,\\
487 - there's going to be hell to pay.\\
488 - Oh, are you okay?\\
489 - I've lost all the feeling in my arms,\\
490 - but it's distracting me\\
491 - from the searing pain in my shoulders.\\
492 - Poor baby.\\
493 - Listen, Nicki, I'm not sure this is going to work.\\
494 - What do you mean?\\
495 - We do all of this stuff,\\
496 - sneaking around and making all these complicated plans,\\
497 - and it feels incredible.\\
498 - I have never felt anything so intense in my life,\\
499 - but, I mean, is that it?\\
500 - What are you saying?\\
501 - We never do any normal boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.\\
502 - I don't know anything about you,\\
503 - except that you really get off on danger.\\
504 - And apparently, I do, too.\\
505 - I'm just not sure that's enough.\\
506 - I think you just insulted me.\\
507 - No. I... Yes, you did!\\
508 - Maybe you don't know anything about me,\\
509 - but I actually bothered to learn things about you.\\
510 - I don't like you\\
511 - because I'm some creepy danger junkie.\\
512 - I like you because you're funny, and you're kind,\\
513 - and you don't let me get away with stuff.\\
514 - And even when you complain, you're funny,\\
515 - and I never have to think about what I'm going\\
516 - to say because it just comes out.\\
517 - And it-it feels right, and I feel safe.\\
518 - Well, wait.\\
519 - I like you because you're really fun and honest.\\
520 - And I don't feel\\
521 - like I'm being tricked when you're nice to me.\\
522 - You're amazing with my friends.\\
523 - You're amazing.\\
524 - Okay, so this is real.\\
525 - It's not just the danger or whatever.\\
526 - This is real.\\
527 - Duh.\\
528 - I'm sorry I yelled at you.\\
529 - I love you.\\
530 - Night, Daddy.\\
531 - Oh, no.\\
532 - I'm late.\\
533 - Oh, me, too.\\
534 - Wait, there was something\\
535 - I was supposed to do at work today.\\
536 - Come home for lunch?\\
537 - That's it.\\
538 - Got to go.\\
539 - Bye. Bye.
\subsection {Episode 07: Malcolm Holds His Tongue}
1 - Hey, Mom, I grew an inch!\\
2 -     Life is unfair...    \\
3 - Stevie, come on. That's ten in a row.\\
4 - I'm sick... of this.\\
5 - It's important!\\
6 - I worked my butt off to make the JV team.\\
7 - I got to stay sharp.\\
8 - Could you at least try  to block it?\\
9 - Still too easy.\\
10 - Can I put you on a ladder?\\
11 - Come back, please!\\
12 - I'll find us a ride!\\
13 - Those concert tickets cost me $40 each.\\
14 - That's two times 40.\\
15 - Divide that in two, and it's $40 a ticket!\\
16 - But it's not my fault I can't drive us.\\
17 - You're the one who had his license taken away!\\
18 - Because my public defender\\
19 - wouldn't even try the insanity defense.\\
20 - Well, you better think of something,\\
21 - because if we can't get there,\\
22 - then we're not going!\\
23 - Don't ever date anyone smarter than you.\\
24 - Okay, break's over.\\
25 - Let's get back to work.\\
26 - You take it out.\\
27 - I want to work on my defense.\\
28 - And this time, don't just sit there.\\
29 - Try to move the ball around.\\
30 - My... bad.\\
31 - I'm sorry. I know I'm being a little crazy,\\
32 - but for the first time in my life,\\
33 - I'm actually good at something\\
34 - that normal people care about.\\
35 - Being on the team is the best thing\\
36 - that's ever happened to me and I don't want to screw it up.\\
37 - All I'm saying is that if we want to win,\\
38 - which I think we do,\\
39 - it seems to me we should be using an offense\\
40 - that has a remote chance of actually working.\\
41 - I can't be the only one here who thinks\\
42 - there's something deeply flawed with your game plan.\\
43 - I think if you thought about it for just a second,\\
44 - you'd realize you need to make some changes.\\
45 - What the hell is wrong with me?!\\
46 - Why can't I just learn to shut up?\\
47 - We're... the same.\\
48 - We speak...\\
49 - before... we think.\\
50 - Malcolm!\\
51 - How many times do I have to tell you to hang up your wet towel\\
52 - after you've used it?!\\
53 - Is that so hard?\\
54 - Because if it is,\\
55 - maybe we should just take your towel away.\\
56 - And the next time you take a shower,\\
57 - you can run around the backyard until you dry.\\
58 - Gee, Mom, wouldn't the front yard be more humiliating?\\
59 - Sorry.\\
60 - And I don't want any...\\
61 - What did you say?\\
62 - I'm sorry.\\
63 - Yes. Well...\\
64 - I can see you boys are studying,\\
65 - so maybe this isn't the best time to deal with this.\\
66 - Do you want any sodas or anything?\\
67 - You're sure you like your birthday present?\\
68 - Dad, the boots are perfect.\\
69 - They're just what I wanted. Listen,\\
70 - they were really expensive, so take good care of them, okay?\\
71 - I will. Don't worry about it.\\
72 - Thanks again, Dad.\\
73 - What the hell are you doing?\\
74 - Piama, this is an old cowboy trick.\\
75 - You soak your boots in water,\\
76 - and you don't take them off, even for a minute,\\
77 - until they are completely dry,\\
78 - even if it takes days.\\
79 - And when you're done, they fit like a glove.\\
80 - I know it seems drastic,\\
81 - but believe me, I know what I'm doing.\\
82 - Those are $300 boots you just ruined.\\
83 - I didn't ruin anything.\\
84 - This is what you're supposed to do!\\
85 - You're going to have to trust me on this.\\
86 - Why do you always talk to me like I'm an idiot?\\
87 - "...and everyone but the rabbit\\
88 - lived happily ever after."\\
89 - And the moral of that fable, son,\\
90 - is that turtles are pathological liars\\
91 - who won't give you their gold.\\
92 - Got it.\\
93 -        \\
94 - Dad?\\
95 - It's like watching the gods return to Olympus.\\
96 - Oh, uh, hello... excuse me...\\
97 - Hey! What is this called?\\
98 - We're racewalking.\\
99 - I've never seen anything like it.\\
100 - The... the style, the grace.\\
101 - Well, it's not all just about looking good.\\
102 - It's the best low-impact aerobic exercise ever invented,\\
103 - despite what you hear from all those Tai-Chi punks.\\
104 - Yeah, but how do you do it?\\
105 - Well, the International Racewalking Federation specifies\\
106 - you must have one foot on the ground at all times.\\
107 - But...\\
108 - And your front leg must remain straight\\
109 - until it's completely under you.\\
110 - Something like this?\\
111 - Hey! I think you've got it!\\
112 - Look at that, guys. I think we got ourselves a natural!\\
113 - Wow!\\
114 - Look at me!\\
115 - I can walk! Yeah!\\
116 - So then what happens is\\
117 - I'm sitting there eating my lunch when\\
118 - Carla comes up to me and she's completely furious at me\\
119 - because Cody dumped her.\\
120 - I mean, yeah, I'm the one who set then up,\\
121 - but does that make it my responsibility?\\
122 - Why are you asking me?\\
123 - I don't even know these people.\\
124 - I know, I know. I can see her side, too,\\
125 - but she was completely screaming at me.\\
126 - And now I feel bad because she was crying,\\
127 - and I just kept thinking,\\
128 - "Did I do something so totally wrong?"\\
129 - I honestly don't care.\\
130 - My parents are going to be home any minute.\\
131 - Can we  please  start making out while we still have time?\\
132 - Uh-uh.\\
133 - Oh, Malcolm, thank you so much.\\
134 - I'm so lucky to have you.\\
135 - You make me feel so good.\\
136 - Wow, this is fantastic.\\
137 - I'm never going to say what's on my mind ever again.\\
138 - All I have to do is keep my mouth shut.\\
139 - Just not say a word and let her do all the talking and...\\
140 - Dad, please.\\
141 - The concert's Saturday night. I need a ride!\\
142 - Reese, no!\\
143 - Your mom has to work and my car's in the shop.\\
144 - You'll just have to find someone else.\\
145 - Are my hips even?\\
146 - Watch my butt while I walk.\\
147 - Dad, I swear to God,\\
148 - if you don't drive me, I will leave home forever!\\
149 - Or I'll never leave-- whatever's worse.\\
150 - It's your choice, pal.\\
151 - I think you're going to like this.\\
152 - Yeah, yeah, I get it.\\
153 - I put it in my mouth,\\
154 - your toenail clippings are in it,\\
155 - I spit it out, and you've got it all on video.\\
156 - It's been done.\\
157 - I am so sorry about that.\\
158 - But we've both grown up a lot since then,\\
159 - and I have a proposal I think you might find interesting.\\
160 - It's still warm.\\
161 - Now, I know a hip guy like you\\
162 - keeps up with the current music scene.\\
163 - It's awfully short notice\\
164 - and you're probably not even available.\\
165 - What are you talking about?\\
166 - There's a concert this Saturday,\\
167 - and Alison and I were wondering if you'd like to go.\\
168 - You want  me  to go to a concert with  you?\\
169 - Yeah, pretty much. But the real fun part\\
170 - is the drive there and the drive back.\\
171 - But I don't have to tell you, right?\\
172 - I mean, look who I'm talking to--\\
173 - a single, middle-aged guy with a cat?\\
174 - You know all about the dating scene.\\
175 - Well, sure, that's my rep, but...\\
176 - I mean, it's not like you're even excited\\
177 - to go out on a  real  date.\\
178 - It's not like it's something\\
179 - that you'd be bragging about for weeks...\\
180 - Of course not. I mean, who cares?\\
181 - But... if people were to ask,\\
182 - I'm not  forbidden to tell them, am I?\\
183 - Not at all. This is going to be great.\\
184 - And you say I can tell people, right?\\
185 - Hello, everybody!\\
186 - Hey, Hal! Hey, it's "The Natural!"\\
187 - I have to tell you, Hal, I've never seen anybody\\
188 - take to the sport as fast as you.\\
189 - What's it been, three days?\\
190 - Already, you're better than I am.\\
191 - Now, now, it's not about the competition.\\
192 - I mean, it's not a race, right?\\
193 - Whoa!\\
194 - It's only a matter of time till we're surrounded.\\
195 - Now, we've got to get word to Allied Command,\\
196 - but any radio messages will be intercepted.\\
197 - You think I don't know that?\\
198 - I've sent\\
199 - for our secret weapon.\\
200 - You called for me, sir?\\
201 - Corporal. I don't need to tell you\\
202 - the fate of the entire free world\\
203 - depends on you delivering this message\\
204 - to Allied Command by morning.\\
205 - My God, that's 60 miles away.\\
206 - I'll say hello to the boys at HQ for you\\
207 - over waffles, sir.\\
208 - Let's just thank God he's on our side.\\
209 - Oh, my God, it's Wheeler.\\
210 - He must be back from the Nationals.\\
211 - On your left.\\
212 - On your left!\\
213 - On your right! On your left!\\
214 - On your right!\\
215 - Okay, just be cool.\\
216 - No matter what he says, don't say anything.\\
217 - How much simpler can it get?!\\
218 - You pass, pass, pass, dribble, dribble, pass,\\
219 - dribble, pass, shoot!\\
220 - Um, excuse me, Coach.\\
221 - Well, well, well... look who's here.\\
222 - Coach, I'd like to apologize for the other day.\\
223 - I'd like to get back on the team.\\
224 - So, you'd like to apologize and get back on the team?\\
225 - I think I just said that, yes.\\
226 - Do you know what this is?\\
227 - A symbol of my authority.\\
228 - They don't just hand these whistles out to just anybody.\\
229 - It means that I'm in charge.\\
230 - I call the plays. Understood?\\
231 - Yeah. It's a  magic  whistle that makes you all-powerful.\\
232 - All right.\\
233 - You're back on the team.\\
234 - Time!\\
235 - 25 minutes and 43.2 seconds.\\
236 - Damn!\\
237 - Are you sure you started it exactly\\
238 - when I called you from work?\\
239 - Yes. Do you want me to lie to you?\\
240 - All right, go ahead and log in the time, son.\\
241 - Hey, look, Malcolm, come here.\\
242 - I need you to help me make sense of all these times.\\
243 - Now, these are the last three days.\\
244 - Some of these are with the cap, some without.\\
245 - Some with bike shorts, some without; one with both,\\
246 - one in just my pajamas.\\
247 - So you can whip up\\
248 - some kind of scientific analysis of all this, right?\\
249 - Sure, I've only got better to do with the rest of my life.\\
250 - Okay.\\
251 - You're a good son.\\
252 - By the way, how much allowance are we giving you?\\
253 - What family do you live in?\\
254 - Nothing, why?\\
255 - Well, how does five bucks a week sound?\\
256 - - Great. - Hey!\\
257 - Dewey, he's older, and he doesn't give me as much malarkey\\
258 - when I ask him for a favor.\\
259 - Are you biting your nails again?\\
260 - Those look horrible.\\
261 - No. They're fine.\\
262 - Look, I've only got two minutes.\\
263 - A woman thinks I'm looking in the stock room for a humidifier.\\
264 - Now, I want you to listen to this tape\\
265 - and tell me whether you think it's better\\
266 - to go ELO-Kansas-Doobies or Doobies-Kansas-ELO.\\
267 - I'm not telling you which one I'm voting for.\\
268 - What are you talking about?\\
269 - The mix tape! For our date!\\
270 - Didn't you get my e-mails or phone messages\\
271 - or the notes I left under your door?\\
272 - No, I have a lot of homework to do during the week,\\
273 - and I can't really spend...\\
274 - Look, just listen to it tonight\\
275 - and get back to me with your top four choices.\\
276 - Now, what do you think for a shirt?\\
277 - I like the blue, but I'm worried\\
278 - the open-collar look is a bit racy.\\
279 - You don't have any pants on!\\
280 - That's what these are for.\\
281 - I want you to pick your favorites separately,\\
282 - then we'll decide what goes together.\\
283 - Whatever.\\
284 - I am going to call you a million times before Saturday.\\
285 - I haven't been this excited in years.\\
286 - Now I know why people look forward to weekends.\\
287 -        \\
288 -        \\
289 - Oh, please.\\
290 - You know, you're not finished\\
291 - till you put those away and wipe down the counters.\\
292 - Why don't I buff the floor\\
293 - and lick your shoes while I'm at it?!\\
294 - Yes, ma'am.\\
295 - Look at me.\\
296 - Are you on drugs? What?\\
297 - You've been acting really strange lately,\\
298 - and I want to know what's going on.\\
299 - Well, apparently no one in this house can tolerate it\\
300 - when someone's actually being pleasant!\\
301 - Nothing.\\
302 - Nothing?\\
303 - So, everything's fine, everything's normal,\\
304 - you're not acting any different, and I'm just crazy.\\
305 - She's begging for it! Nail her!\\
306 - I'm fine, really.\\
307 - Well, you're looking a little tired.\\
308 - Why don't you let me finish up?\\
309 - All right.\\
310 - Dad, please, it's been three hours.\\
311 - Come on, Wheeler,\\
312 - give me something.\\
313 - What's your secret?\\
314 - You're starting to ruin TV for me.\\
315 - I study your moves, I copy your techniques,\\
316 - but somehow you continue to  blow  me out of the water.\\
317 - Why?! How?!\\
318 - Maybe he's just better than you.\\
319 - Have you ever thought of that?\\
320 - Billy Vargas can spit\\
321 - ten feet further than I can.\\
322 - I accept that.\\
323 - Why can't you?\\
324 - Oh, Dewey, maybe you're right.\\
325 - Maybe God didn't put me on this Earth to beat this guy.\\
326 - I mean, look at him.\\
327 - Perfect posture,\\
328 - great hip rotation, his...\\
329 - Wait a minute.\\
330 - Both feet off the ground\\
331 - at the same time!\\
332 - Dewey, do you see that?!\\
333 - That's  air.\\
334 - That... that's air!\\
335 - That's it!\\
336 - I'm going to go read a book!\\
337 - I hope you're happy!\\
338 - Now, since Jeanette got the T-shirt from my last 50K,\\
339 - I think it's only fair to give you girls my socks.\\
340 - Oh, my God!\\
341 - Sorry to interrupt, Wheeler,\\
342 - but I thought we could have a little race.\\
343 - Apparently, this man's a lot like you girls--\\
344 - you all can't get enough of looking at my backside.\\
345 - This shouldn't take long.\\
346 - Oh, and just one more thing.\\
347 - This time, just to be different, let's...\\
348 - walk.\\
349 - What are you talking about?\\
350 - You thought no one would discover\\
351 - your dirty little secret, didn't you?\\
352 - That clever little\\
353 - flail of the wrist every four steps,\\
354 - masking the hop.\\
355 - But you can't fool the tape.\\
356 - The tape sees all, and I see the tape.\\
357 - You are not a racewalker at all.\\
358 - You're nothing but a common jogger.\\
359 - That is so rid...\\
360 - Don't worry.\\
361 - He won't get far.\\
362 - One-two-three, there! One-two-three, there!\\
363 - One-two-three, there!\\
364 - So, then, when I was 13,\\
365 - I got my first velour shirt, and everything changed.\\
366 - Suddenly, there was an opening in the astronomy club.\\
367 - People started sitting on my side of the bus.\\
368 - But I'm a Libra, so I like to think\\
369 - the best of people.\\
370 - So, Craig, I was telling Alison\\
371 - how well you focus on your driving.\\
372 - No, you were just telling me\\
373 - that if I really loved you, I'd let you get under my...\\
374 - So, you guys like to take long walks on the beach?\\
375 - I sure do.\\
376 - Plus, I'm a grand master at Battleship.\\
377 - I've got the hat if you'd like to see it.\\
378 - So, Ali, do you have any brothers or sisters?\\
379 - What do you think you're doing?!\\
380 - You don't talk to me. You just start kissing?\\
381 - I am a person, and I deserve\\
382 - some conversation and some of the social niceties\\
383 - before the kissing starts.\\
384 - You know what, I was okay when he pulled over twice\\
385 - to change his shirt, but I really don't think\\
386 - he should be yelling at me.\\
387 - Okay, don't freak out. I can handle this.\\
388 - My family kind of owns him.\\
389 - You know, Craig, another thing girls really like\\
390 - is the strong, silent type.\\
391 - Craig, Craig, you just passed the concert!\\
392 - Oh, no, I don't think so.\\
393 - But there was a sign, and it had an arrow,\\
394 - and we're supposed to follow the pointy end!\\
395 - Oh, come on.\\
396 - There's other fun things we can do.\\
397 - I thought we'd start with a hayride,\\
398 - and then a light dinner at Cicero's.\\
399 - I've already tipped the violinist\\
400 - to drop by our table, for the lady.\\
401 - Then I thought we'd cap off the evening\\
402 - with a nice, romantic bonfire at the lake.\\
403 - Craig, you are ruining our date!\\
404 - Now, listen here!\\
405 - Do you know how long\\
406 - I have dreamed and planned for this night?\\
407 - 34 years!\\
408 - And I am not going to let you little brats ruin it!\\
409 - We are going to have a hayride and dinner and a bonfire,\\
410 - and this is going to be a magical evening\\
411 - that will live in our hearts  forever!\\
412 - What's that on your glasses?\\
413 - What?\\
414 - Oh, my God!\\
415 - Reese, you said she'd be nice to me!\\
416 - You said she'd like me!\\
417 - Yeah, let's ditch this loser.\\
418 - Okay, okay.\\
419 - See you at school.\\
420 - Why?\\
421 - Well, as you can see,\\
422 - Miss Doubting Piama, it may have taken\\
423 - days and days of wearing sopping wet boots,\\
424 - but they are now snug, supple and perfectly form-fitting.\\
425 - You were right, honey.\\
426 - Which would also make you...\\
427 - Mistaken.\\
428 - You know, I could\\
429 - push for a more abject admission of your wrongness,\\
430 - but I'm going to be a bigger man.\\
431 - With better boots.\\
432 - Call me when you get tired of this.\\
433 - Could be late.\\
434 - Oh...!\\
435 - If I hold out for a few days,\\
436 - maybe the fungus will eat the mushrooms.\\
437 - How can we be losing to a team\\
438 - that hasn't won a game in three years?!\\
439 - Maybe because you're a complete moron!\\
440 - You know I can shoot!\\
441 - Why won't you put me in?!\\
442 - For God's sake, that's it.\\
443 - Time-out!\\
444 - All right, everybody up, come on!\\
445 - All right,\\
446 - you yo-yos.\\
447 - Do you want to know why we can't beat this team?\\
448 - Because you're not letting anyone shoot!\\
449 - We're just passing the ball back and forth!\\
450 - Nobody on this team has any heart.\\
451 - Not a man.\\
452 - You know, when the Allies first hit the beach at Iwo Jima,\\
453 - they didn't have better weapons than the Germans.\\
454 - They had something more than firepower.\\
455 - Have you completely lost your mind?!\\
456 - Put me in!\\
457 - Let me shoot... the... ball!\\
458 - Not one of you has been able to forget\\
459 - about the water in your boots, or the sand in your mess kit\\
460 - long enough to focus on the success of the entire unit!\\
461 - Tell him to shut up and put you in.\\
462 - Tell him, tell him!\\
463 - Malcolm... do you think you  can follow my game plan?\\
464 - No, because you're a freakin' idiot.\\
465 - I hate you.\\
466 - I want to kill you and dance on your shallow grave.\\
467 - That's my game plan.\\
468 - All right, get in there.\\
469 - Thanks.\\
470 - A peptic ulcer?\\
471 - How did you manage to get a peptic ulcer?\\
472 - The doctor said you have the stomach lining\\
473 - of a 60-year-old air traffic controller.\\
474 - You are a teenager, for God's sake.\\
475 - What do you have to be stressed about?!\\
476 - For your information,\\
477 - I just spent the past three hours on a gurney\\
478 - next to a guy who is still trying to smoke\\
479 - out of the hole in his neck.\\
480 - And the jackass who put in this I.V.\\
481 - couldn't find a vein with two hands and a flashlight!\\
482 - My call button doesn't work!\\
483 - These stupid sheets are itchy.\\
484 - There's only one channel on the TV.\\
485 - And what's this about a bedpan?!\\
486 - This is great, isn't it?\\
487 - Alison's nice, but I have to say\\
488 - I think a date's better with just two people.\\
489 - Can we stop calling this a date?\\
490 - Well, whatever it is,\\
491 - I can't wait to see the look on my neighbor's face\\
492 - when I come strolling home after 11:00.\\
493 - Eat your heart out, Mrs. Klevesahl.\\
494 - I think I just missed my curfew.\\
495 - There are no curfews on a night like tonight.\\
496 -     Here I am, the one that you love    \\
497 -     Asking for another day    \\
498 -     Understand the one that you love    \\
499 -     Loves you in so many ways...    
\subsection {Episode 08: Boys at Ranch}
1 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
2 -     I don't know    \\
3 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
4 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
5 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     And you're not so big    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     Life is unfair.    \\
13 - Come on, let's go!\\
14 - What are we waiting for?!\\
15 - Dad's taking us to Francis' dude ranch for the weekend.\\
16 - Just the guys.\\
17 - I'm really going to miss my girlfriend Nicki.\\
18 - But then again, it's two days without Mom.\\
19 - I've been in the car since 6:00.\\
20 - Come on, Dad!\\
21 - You'll see her Sunday!\\
22 - I, uh... had to get my coffee.\\
23 - Okay, gentlemen...\\
24 - ready to roll? Yeah, let's do it.\\
25 - Let's roll already! Yeah, come on, Dad.\\
26 - Seat belt-- check.\\
27 - Map-- check.\\
28 - Sunglasses-- check.\\
29 - Lumbar pillow...\\
30 - check.\\
31 - Mirrors-- check.\\
32 - Does that sound like a loose valve casing to you?\\
33 - Dad! All right.\\
34 - You boys will soon learn\\
35 - there's nothing wrong with being careful.\\
36 - Wow!\\
37 - Welcome to the Grotto.\\
38 - I'll be with you in one minute.\\
39 - No rush. We're just looking for Francis.\\
40 - Francis?\\
41 - You are Francis' family?\\
42 - Yes, we were just...\\
43 - Welcome, family of Francis.\\
44 - I am Otto, and this is Gretchen.\\
45 - We have dreamed for months of meeting you\\
46 - and now finally you are here.\\
47 - And look at beautiful liebling!\\
48 - Your son is a genius.\\
49 - He has completely turned this place around.\\
50 - Well, not physically, of course.\\
51 - We still face the arroyo as before,\\
52 - but we could never have survived\\
53 - without his hard work, Mm-mm.\\
54 - his intelligence Mm-hmm.\\
55 - his leadership...\\
56 - Really?\\
57 - Now, you just have the one Francis?\\
58 - As long as you are here, everything is on the house.\\
59 - Now, would you like to review the staff?\\
60 - Oh, I...\\
61 - Please? It would mean so much to them.\\
62 - Good. Mmm.\\
63 - Well...\\
64 - Aren't they wonderful?\\
65 - They are Hopi Indian kachina dolls.\\
66 - Now, according to legend,\\
67 - he tracks down misbehaving children\\
68 - und  chews up their bones\\
69 - so no one will ever find them again.\\
70 - Mythology is so much fun, don't you think?\\
71 - Oh, no, no. No.\\
72 - They are far too valuable.\\
73 - You mustn't touch them.\\
74 - Can I trust you?\\
75 - I don't see why not.\\
76 - Uh... very nice.\\
77 - I like your boots. Give him your boots.\\
78 - No, no! No, no, I couldn't.\\
79 - You all look wonderful.\\
80 - Thank you.\\
81 - Do you hear that?\\
82 - He likes us.\\
83 - Back to work.\\
84 - Hey, guys.\\
85 - I'm so sorry.\\
86 - I came as fast as I could. Hey.\\
87 - I-I'm not going to get too close.\\
88 - I'm fighting a terrible cold.\\
89 - I'll probably be in bed all weekend.\\
90 - Mom didn't come.\\
91 - Well, we'll just have to enjoy ourselves without her.\\
92 - Come on.\\
93 - So, where's Francis?\\
94 - Is he really the foreman?\\
95 - We haven't seen him in months.\\
96 - You'll have to forgive the boys.\\
97 - They've always looked up to Francis\\
98 - like he's some kind of hero.\\
99 - How's it going, guys?\\
100 - My God, Francis!\\
101 - How the heck did you learn to ride a horse like that?\\
102 - Well, you got to pick it up quick around here.\\
103 - We break horses, brand cattle...\\
104 - It's about as close to the Old West as you'll ever find.\\
105 - Where do I find the jazzercise class?\\
106 - Other side of the smoothie bar.\\
107 - Oh, that chicken was fantastic.\\
108 - And where'd you learn to cook chili like that?\\
109 - I spend time in the kitchen, too.\\
110 - The secret to good chili is how long you soak the beans.\\
111 - So, to recap our little contest--\\
112 - Dewey wins for most tuneful.\\
113 - Francis for the loudest.\\
114 - I was the sneakiest.\\
115 - Malcolm, the most obnoxious. Ech.\\
116 - At least I wasn't disqualified.\\
117 - I gambled and lost.\\
118 - It happens.\\
119 - This is fun.\\
120 - Why don't we do this every weekend?\\
121 - Boy, wouldn't that be nice?\\
122 - Oh, I almost forgot.\\
123 - Francis, I booked a trip for all of us\\
124 - to watch the sunrise tomorrow morning at Devil's Rock.\\
125 - I don't want to get up at sunrise\\
126 - to go look at some stupid rock.\\
127 - It may be a stupid rock for most of the year,\\
128 - but for the rest of this week\\
129 - the angle of the sun at dawn makes it look\\
130 - like there's fire coming out of the devil's eyes.\\
131 - Actually, I can't do it tomorrow, Dad.\\
132 - What do you mean you can't?\\
133 - You were the one who called me and told me about it.\\
134 - I know, but I have to lead a ride at 7:00\\
135 - and it takes me two hours to get the horses ready.\\
136 - Can we go on that ride? Yeah, can we?\\
137 - Sure. Yeah! All right.\\
138 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
139 - I brought some stuff I wanted to burn.\\
140 - You're on cowboy time now.\\
141 - You got to get to bed early and rest up\\
142 - if you want to come riding in the morning.\\
143 - Bed? But I'm not tired. Sorry about the Devil's Rock thing.\\
144 - Hey, don't worry about it.\\
145 - I'll go by myself.\\
146 - It'll be great.\\
147 - Here it comes.\\
148 - Wow.\\
149 - That's amazing, Dad.\\
150 - I'm so happy we could do this together, son.\\
151 - All right, we got some loose gravel coming up\\
152 - so let's keep your horses in line.\\
153 - How do you know if the one you're on is still alive?\\
154 - No one rides fast until you're familiar with the horses.\\
155 - So, let's keep both hands on the reins\\
156 - and keep those helmets on tight.\\
157 - What's with Francis?\\
158 - I don't know. We've been riding for an hour,\\
159 - I can still see the barn.\\
160 - Whoa, those look cool.\\
161 - When can we ride those?\\
162 - You're not going anywhere near those.\\
163 - What? Why not?\\
164 - Because I know you guys\\
165 - and I don't want to take a day off work\\
166 - just to peel your carcasses out of a barbwire fence.\\
167 - Why don't you guys just and relax\\
168 - and enjoy the scenery?\\
169 - You seem to be the only riders having a problem.\\
170 - Is Joey the big cowboy?\\
171 - Yes, he is.\\
172 - Yes, he is.\\
173 - Why won't you guys play Ping-Pong with me?\\
174 - The table's free and I've got the equipment form\\
175 - for Dad to sign.\\
176 - Because you're stupid. And we didn't come\\
177 - all the way out here\\
178 - to be stuck playing with you.\\
179 - Wait just a minute.\\
180 - That is precisely why we came out here--\\
181 - so that we can all have a good time together.\\
182 - Now, your brother asked you to play with him\\
183 - and that is exactly what you are going to do.\\
184 - Our dad signed the permission slip for the ATVs.\\
185 - Mmm.\\
186 - You don't look 16 to me.\\
187 - It's a glandular thing.\\
188 - He's very sensitive about how short he is.\\
189 - Ooh. Perhaps you are a late bloomer.\\
190 - I had my baby teeth until I was 14.\\
191 - I'll get the keys.\\
192 - "All terrain."\\
193 - I wonder if that actually means all  terrain.\\
194 - They couldn't say it if it wasn't true.\\
195 - Whee-hee!\\
196 - Okay, so trees aren't terrain.\\
197 - Now we know.\\
198 - Ow!\\
199 - I specifically told you guys\\
200 - stay away from those ATVs!\\
201 - What the hell were you thinking?!\\
202 - They don't think, Francis. They never have!\\
203 - The only thing their heads are good for\\
204 - is to plug up their necks.\\
205 - I blame the oldest one.\\
206 - The others follow him like sheep.\\
207 - I thought I could trust you guys\\
208 - on your own for a few minutes.\\
209 - Well, obviously I was wrong.\\
210 - You are still the same stupid, reckless idiots\\
211 - you've always been.\\
212 - Francis, you don't have to yell at them like that.\\
213 - I'll yell at whoever I want!\\
214 - And even though I wish I hadn't said that,\\
215 - it's too late now!\\
216 - From now on, you boys stay away from the horses,\\
217 - the vehicles, the pool and the other guests.\\
218 - That means you are confined\\
219 - to your room until further notice.\\
220 - You're sending us to our room?! That's right.\\
221 - I don't believe it.\\
222 - You've turned into Mom.\\
223 - Yeah? Well, sometimes Mom's right.\\
224 - You take that back!\\
225 - Oh, my God.\\
226 - You broke my doll?\\
227 - How could you be so thoughtless?\\
228 - You promised me\\
229 - you would leave it alone,\\
230 - but it was just... a lie.\\
231 - Oh...\\
232 - All right, boys, go to your room now!\\
233 - There, there.\\
234 - We will give him new legs\\
235 - and then he will be all good again\\
236 - just like cousin Heinrich.\\
237 - Well, you did the right thing, Francis.\\
238 - I just don't know when they're going to learn.\\
239 - Them? What about you?\\
240 - How could you sign a release form\\
241 - and not read what it's intended for?\\
242 - For God's sake, Dad,\\
243 - my job is hard enough as it is.\\
244 - "Sometimes Mom's right?\\
245 - Sometimes Mom's right?"\\
246 - Why didn't he just throw acid in our faces?\\
247 - You know, I'd actually prefer that.\\
248 - I can't believe he yelled at us\\
249 - right in front of that French guy.\\
250 - He can't get away with this.\\
251 - We're going to get him back.\\
252 - You're damn right we are.\\
253 - Are you with us, Dewey?\\
254 - Dewey?\\
255 - And I know I shouldn't have taken it\\
256 - but it looked so cool.\\
257 - And then in the tree\\
258 - I forgot it was in my pocket, and I fell... and it broke.\\
259 - Oh, I know, I know, sweetheart.\\
260 - And you know what?\\
261 - I should never have yelled at you.\\
262 - I feel terrible about that.\\
263 - You do?\\
264 - Oh, of course I do.\\
265 - So, we both feel bad about what we did, huh?\\
266 - You know what your Tante Gretchen does when she feels bad?\\
267 - She works.\\
268 - She works herself to the point\\
269 - where her body screams in pain\\
270 - and her soul begs for mercy.\\
271 - Why?\\
272 - It's the best form of penance.\\
273 - Oh, when my fingers are raw, and my back is racked\\
274 - with crippling pain, I feel all better.\\
275 - Well, that might work for you...\\
276 - Let's do it. Oh!\\
277 - This will be  wunderbar.\\
278 - The two old men go for a ride.\\
279 - See the beauty of the desert, commune with nature...\\
280 - I just hate to take up too much of your time.\\
281 - I already told the horses that we're going.\\
282 - Don't make me look bad.\\
283 - Whoo!\\
284 - Wh-what's the matter with this horse?\\
285 - Nothing. Buttercup is very sweet.\\
286 - Are you sure\\
287 - you're not still angry with the boys?\\
288 - Buttercup is very good at picking up unresolved feelings.\\
289 - No. I told you, I'm over it. I'm fine.\\
290 - Buttercup is never wrong.\\
291 - Once Gretchen made me an omelet with mushrooms.\\
292 - Oh, I hate mushrooms.\\
293 - But I didn't say anything. I had two helpings.\\
294 - Well, Buttercup forced me to go back\\
295 - and confront her.\\
296 - We had the best sex we had had in years.\\
297 - Thank you, Buttercup.\\
298 - Maybe I should ride your horse.\\
299 - Good idea.\\
300 - Scout doesn't pick up on anything...\\
301 - unless you're secretly gay.\\
302 - Thanks, very much.\\
303 - Hey, fellas, what can I do for you?\\
304 - Um, we're looking for some sparklers.\\
305 - And do you have any of those things called pinwheels?\\
306 - Sure do.\\
307 - Also got some lady fingers.\\
308 - Okay, let's start with 18 genies,\\
309 - two dozen gel-ignited pomegranates\\
310 - and a case of devil dragons.\\
311 - We're out of the 99s, you want 44s at half price?\\
312 - 44s are worthless.\\
313 - Make it six packs of red dogs with time-delay fuses.\\
314 - Powder or aluminum phosphate?\\
315 - Who do you think you're dealing with?\\
316 - One last thing.\\
317 - We're planning an event for a friend.\\
318 - You got anything that will make it really special?\\
319 - Depends on how much you're willing to spend.\\
320 - Why don't you let my dad worry about that?\\
321 - Boys... I'd like to introduce you...\\
322 - ...to the Komodo 3000.\\
323 - Oh, yeah. This will get him back.\\
324 - How are we doing?\\
325 - My fingers hurt\\
326 - but that bad feeling in my stomach is getting better.\\
327 - This is good.\\
328 - It means you are getting in touch with your guilt,  ja?\\
329 - What's the matter?\\
330 - I just remembered when I was nine,\\
331 - my uncle gave me a pfennig to put in the wishing well\\
332 - but I threw a pebble in the well und  I kept the pfennig.\\
333 - I am pure evil.\\
334 - I once put a garden slug in Reese's sandwich...\\
335 - and he ate it.\\
336 - Und  you feel bad about this?\\
337 - Then scrub.\\
338 - Oh, look. Blood.\\
339 - We are halfway there.\\
340 - I can see why you love it out here, Otto.\\
341 - Yeah, yeah, this is where I come to think,\\
342 - to unwind, or when I am in the doghouse with Gretchen.\\
343 - Ooh, I can be a naughty boy.\\
344 - I have a barstool in the garage for the same thing.\\
345 - Oh.\\
346 - Well...\\
347 - I suppose we should be heading back.\\
348 - Yeah, yeah, we could do that or...\\
349 - we could get to know each other a little better.\\
350 - Is that schnapps?\\
351 - In my experience, many interesting things\\
352 - can be discovered with just the proper dosage.\\
353 - Watch this.\\
354 - Oh, good shooting.\\
355 - You shot that rock clean into two.\\
356 - Yeah!\\
357 - To Hal. To Otto.\\
358 - Salud.\\
359 - Salud!\\
360 - Oh, have you ever seen so many stars in the sky.\\
361 - Oh, look. Up there.\\
362 - There's Orion. Where?\\
363 - Right there.\\
364 - Those three stars are his belt.\\
365 - What? There?\\
366 - No. There.\\
367 - And there is his spear.\\
368 - Oh, great.\\
369 - Something scared off the horses. Oh...\\
370 - Ooh. Whoa.\\
371 - Run!\\
372 - Ooh! Something bit me.\\
373 - Oh, God, Otto, you're wounded.\\
374 - Finally... I hit something.\\
375 - Well, I just listened\\
376 - at the boys' door and not a peep.\\
377 - I hated coming down on them like that\\
378 - but that's the only way they'll listen.\\
379 - Absolutely.\\
380 - I mean, I think I was hard but fair.\\
381 - You couldn't have been more fair.\\
382 - Okay, and now you're smiling which means\\
383 - in about two seconds I'm going to look like a jackass.\\
384 - You can keep going if you want.\\
385 - Just tell me. The boys haven't been\\
386 - in the room for three hours. What?\\
387 - They want you to meet them at the south gate.\\
388 - This should explain everything.\\
389 - I'm afraid it starts off a little antagonistic.\\
390 - Is that last word "lick" or "wipe"?\\
391 - I think you're safe either way.\\
392 - How far do you think we've gone?\\
393 - Well, judging by that rock formation over there,\\
394 - about 12 feet.\\
395 - Oh, if only Francis knew we were out here\\
396 - he would save us.\\
397 - Oh, sure.\\
398 - Super Francis.\\
399 - He'd make a jetpack out of a cactus\\
400 - and fly us all home.\\
401 - Why are you so angry at Francis?\\
402 - I am not angry at Francis.\\
403 - Well, well you shouldn't be.\\
404 - He is smart, he is capable,\\
405 - he is hardworking\\
406 - and I personally never met anyone more "relibable."\\
407 - Yes, now.\\
408 - When I had him for 18 years,\\
409 - I punished him and threatened him and cried over him\\
410 - and begged him and screamed at him\\
411 - and his life was one train wreck after another.\\
412 - Two months with you and now he's a model citizen.\\
413 - And this is what you are so upset about?\\
414 - Yes, I think it's pretty obvious.\\
415 - All he needed was his father to get out of his face\\
416 - so that he could meet someone\\
417 - who knows how to turn his life around.\\
418 - Well, if I am such a genius, how come that I am drunk\\
419 - and lost in the desert with a bullet in my ass?\\
420 - Hal, listen to me.\\
421 - Francis had all of his great qualities\\
422 - on the day that I met him.\\
423 - What?\\
424 - What do you think?\\
425 - He just picked them up off the road?\\
426 - "Hello, I would like a Big Gulp and a candy bar\\
427 - and a new personality."\\
428 - No, Hal. Listen to me.\\
429 - Your acorn\\
430 - did not fall very far from your tree.\\
431 - So I'm not such a failure as a father?\\
432 - Absolutely not.\\
433 - Now, if your crisis is over,\\
434 - my buttocks could use a vigorous rubbing.\\
435 - They are starting to go numb.\\
436 - Oh, that's it, Dewey.\\
437 - We can't miss a spot.\\
438 - Right corner.\\
439 - Got it.\\
440 - Ja.\\
441 - I think that is it.\\
442 - Finally, we are finished.\\
443 - Wow, I feel wonderful.\\
444 - Ja,  it's beautiful, isn't it?\\
445 - This is the moment you work for.\\
446 - Your soul is set free.\\
447 - Your burden has been lifted.\\
448 - I kind of feel like I'm floating.\\
449 - Well, that's probably the ammonia\\
450 - but we have done well.\\
451 - A clean room leads to a clean conscience,  ja?\\
452 - I think I'm happier than I've ever been.\\
453 - Mm, me, too,  liebe.\\
454 - Here, I want to give you something.\\
455 - Promise you will think of me when you use it.\\
456 - Thank you, Tante Gretchen.\\
457 - De nada.\\
458 - I don't know what you guys are trying\\
459 - to pull here but you should know\\
460 - I am way ahead of you.\\
461 - What's that?\\
462 - Looks like a fuse.\\
463 - All right, what exactly are you planning?\\
464 - We're planning to get you back.\\
465 - We want our brother back\\
466 - the way he used to be.\\
467 - We know how much you always liked fire...\\
468 - explosions...\\
469 - Nice try.\\
470 - That was a long time ago.\\
471 - Really?\\
472 - So, where does this go?\\
473 - Well, I suppose you could find out by crawling over the fence\\
474 - and following the fuse\\
475 - or you could find out the Francis way.\\
476 - We're sure you'll make the right decision.\\
477 - Guys, I'm telling you, things are different now.\\
478 - I'm married, I have responsibilities.\\
479 - I'm just not a 16-year-old maniac anymore who...\\
480 - Huh, interesting.\\
481 - Does anything look familiar, Otto?\\
482 - Just keep heading towards those mountains.\\
483 - Behind us is certain death.\\
484 - That's right,  this way is certain death.\\
485 - I wonder what that is.\\
486 - I'll tell you what that is.\\
487 - That is Francis showing us the way home.\\
488 - I told you he'd get us out of this.\\
489 - Yes, of course. Come on, come on.\\
490 - This may even top Homecoming '98.\\
491 - I don't know.\\
492 - That float smoldered for a week.\\
493 - How do we know which one's the Komodo 3000?\\
494 - Let's hope that was it.\\
495 - Did it say when our vision would come back?\\
496 - Box said two days.\\
497 - Totally worth it.
\subsection {Episode 09: Grandma Sues}
1 - Check this out.\\
2 - What does it say?\\
3 - Just read it. It's funny.\\
4 - I don't read.\\
5 - Not unless I absolutely have to for school.\\
6 - Otherwise, I feel like they've won.\\
7 - You never read the paper?\\
8 - No.\\
9 - Not even comics?\\
10 - Like Peanuts?\\
11 - You never read Peanuts?\\
12 - Nope.\\
13 - Are you serious?\\
14 - You've never read Peanuts?\\
15 - Uh-uh.\\
16 - Go ahead.\\
17 - I promise I'll hold it.\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - Malcolm, I said come in for breakfast!\\
31 - Francis and Piama came to visit\\
32 - at the same time Grandma was here.\\
33 - Eight people, seven sleeping spaces.\\
34 - Guess who gets the shaft.\\
35 - This is my reward for being at the library\\
36 - when they asked for a volunteer.\\
37 - Malcolm, this is your last chance!\\
38 - I got to get in there.\\
39 - Breakfast has turned into the best part of the day.\\
40 - I can't believe what I'm hearing!\\
41 - Are you insane or just evil?\\
42 - Aah! Wolves should rip out your throat!\\
43 - What kind of a complete idiot butters their toast like that?!\\
44 - Everybody knows\\
45 - it's inside to outside!\\
46 - Come talk to me of toast\\
47 - when you grow some hair in your pants.\\
48 - Stupid animal thinks he knows about toast.\\
49 - Mom, would you please pass the potatoes?\\
50 - I think you've had more than enough potatoes.\\
51 - Does the chair have\\
52 - to break before you stop eating?\\
53 - I told you my family was worse than your family.\\
54 - Are you kidding?\\
55 - My grandpa chopped the pinky off our milkman\\
56 - for bringing us two percent.\\
57 - Hey! Mom, Grandma just stole my bacon.\\
58 - Reese, this is Grandma's last day here.\\
59 - If she wants your bacon, you let her have it.\\
60 - Crybaby.\\
61 - Okay, Ida,\\
62 - I went ahead and did all your packing for you.\\
63 - Let's get a move on.\\
64 - Bus doesn't leave for three hours.\\
65 - Yeah, but, uh, there could be a parade.\\
66 - It could take us all day to get through the traffic.\\
67 - Oh, great.\\
68 - There's barely any food left.\\
69 - Well, you should have come when I called you.\\
70 - Call when you get home, Mom.\\
71 - We'll miss you.\\
72 - Even the little one lies.\\
73 - Reese, I asked you to rake these leaves.\\
74 - I'm waiting for the rest of them to fall first.\\
75 - Let's not delay Grandma\\
76 - by having this needless discussion, shall we?\\
77 - Oh, sure.\\
78 - Can't wait to get me out your door.\\
79 - Forcing an old woman on the...\\
80 - Mom!\\
81 - Grandma's back.\\
82 - Mom wants you to help her unpack.\\
83 - This is unbelievable. It's all Reese's fault.\\
84 - If he had just cleaned up the yard like he was supposed to,\\
85 - none of this would have happened.\\
86 - Malcolm, she slipped on a leaf.\\
87 - A tiny, single leaf.\\
88 - I wouldn't be surprised\\
89 - if she broke her collarbone on purpose\\
90 - just so she could stay here and torment us.\\
91 - And I'm the one who suffers.\\
92 - I was so close to sleeping in the house again.\\
93 - I forget what a bed feels like.\\
94 - What are you complaining about?\\
95 - I'm the one who had to carry her to the car\\
96 - with her dress hiked up over her hips.\\
97 - I went blind for almost 15 minutes.\\
98 - Oh, it's just you.\\
99 - What are you doing?\\
100 - Everyone's blaming me\\
101 - for Grandma getting hurt,\\
102 - and I got an idea for how to cheer everyone up.\\
103 - What are you going to do? I don't know if I can trust you.\\
104 - Come on, you can.\\
105 - Hmm.\\
106 - Tell you what.\\
107 - Punch yourself in the face.\\
108 - Okay, you're in.\\
109 - First thing you can do is show me\\
110 - how to turn this thing on.\\
111 - Your fingers are too fat.\\
112 - Who has fingers like that?\\
113 - I'm losing my appetite just looking at them.\\
114 - She can feed herself, Lois.\\
115 - I didn't ask for this.\\
116 - This is your fault.\\
117 - You keep your yard\\
118 - like a jungle.\\
119 - And steps.\\
120 - Who builds a house with steps?\\
121 - You think you're better than everybody else?\\
122 - Well?\\
123 - My family's still worse.\\
124 - My mom faked stomach cancer so she wouldn't get custody.\\
125 - There's time.\\
126 - Just use your tongue as leverage.\\
127 - Enough!\\
128 - I had better food\\
129 - in refugee camp.\\
130 - Boy, everyone's in such a crappy mood.\\
131 - It's awful.\\
132 - If only there was some way to cheer everyone up.\\
133 - Be cool.\\
134 - I'll get it.\\
135 - It's for me.\\
136 - Here, Mom, let me help you.\\
137 - You're eating dinner?\\
138 - Nobody even called me!\\
139 - What happened to your face?\\
140 - An owl flew into my tent.\\
141 - If I knew I was missing dinner,\\
142 - I would have grabbed the snake out of his beak.\\
143 - Yes?\\
144 - Is this 1233...\\
145 - Go ahead. This is her.\\
146 - You've been served.\\
147 - What are you waiting for, a tip?\\
148 - Get out of here!\\
149 - You're suing us?\\
150 - Okay, you win.\\
151 - You're suing us?!\\
152 - Hal, keep it down.\\
153 - The boys are in the house.\\
154 - Don't be so dramatic.\\
155 - I am suing insurance company.\\
156 - Our  insurance company!\\
157 - You don't think I have a case?\\
158 - You don't think I have pain?\\
159 - That I have suffered?\\
160 - For years, I have suffered in silence.\\
161 - Useless, miserable, money-grubbing old hag!\\
162 - Keep talking tough, boy.\\
163 - I sue you, too.\\
164 - All right, everybody just calm down.\\
165 - Mother, please, think about what you're doing.\\
166 - You are suing your own child.\\
167 - I don't want to talk about it anymore.\\
168 - Let the lawyers handle it.\\
169 - Lawyer?!\\
170 - We don't have a lawyer.\\
171 - Well, you better get one.\\
172 - She can't get away with this!\\
173 - I've had it!\\
174 - I'm going to toss her out on her cage.\\
175 - Hal, we can't do that.\\
176 - She's my mother.\\
177 - My twisted, horrible monster of a mother.\\
178 - Why don't we just kill the old hag?\\
179 - Oh, just stop it right now.\\
180 - And nobody tells the boys about any of this.\\
181 - You mean about killing her?\\
182 - No, Hal.\\
183 - About the lawsuit.\\
184 - Oh.\\
185 - I think I'm going to be sick. I know.\\
186 - I feel the same way. No, I really think\\
187 - I'm going to throw up.\\
188 - Well,\\
189 - I think I figured out\\
190 - why you're feeling so lousy, Lois.\\
191 - You're pregnant.\\
192 - Pregnant?\\
193 - Congratulations.\\
194 - This is the best part of my job.\\
195 - Seeing the looks on people's faces\\
196 - when I give them the good news.\\
197 - This is...\\
198 - fantastic.\\
199 - Thank you so much, Doctor.\\
200 - Now, you're 100% sure?\\
201 - Because it would be terrible if you were somehow wrong.\\
202 - Like, maybe my chart got mixed up with someone else's?\\
203 - No. It's your chart.\\
204 - I promise.\\
205 - Could you just...\\
206 - make our happiness complete and-and...\\
207 - and check again?\\
208 - Yes. Take as much blood as you need.\\
209 - Just be certain.\\
210 - We wouldn't want you to take our dream away.\\
211 - Relax.\\
212 - I am absolutely sure.\\
213 - Congratulations.\\
214 - Oh, my God, this is awful!\\
215 - This can't be right.\\
216 - This must be some sort of mistake.\\
217 - What are we going to do?\\
218 - I don't know. We can't afford the children we have!\\
219 - If this baby is half as bad\\
220 - as our least bad one, we're still ruined.\\
221 - Oh, this has got to be some kind of cruel joke!\\
222 - Terrible. Just terrible.\\
223 - Are you as turned on as I am?\\
224 - Hal!\\
225 - I'm done with my business.\\
226 - You can't fool me.\\
227 - I know you're out there.\\
228 - Okay, whose turn is it?\\
229 - She's not my grandma.\\
230 - Okay, I'm thinking of a number.\\
231 - Wait a minute.\\
232 - You're just writing down the number\\
233 - so you can't be the one.\\
234 - One. That's it. You're up.\\
235 - Enjoy. Go ahead, Malcolm.\\
236 - This is so unfair!\\
237 - I don't even live here.\\
238 - The longer you wait, the worse it'll be!\\
239 - I hate you all.\\
240 - You know, my parents don't come home\\
241 - for another half an hour.\\
242 - You're dreaming.\\
243 - Come on! I'm going crazy.\\
244 - Okay.\\
245 - Hey, guys, I'm going to go show Piama\\
246 - the... posters in your room for a while.\\
247 - Have fun. Good idea.\\
248 - I thought they'd never leave.\\
249 - Tell me about it.\\
250 - Okay, it's still good.\\
251 - I'll get the gift wrap.\\
252 - You write the card.\\
253 - There's no lock?\\
254 - With my brothers?\\
255 - They just got the door back a few months ago.\\
256 - I don't know, Francis.\\
257 - This feels weird.\\
258 - In your brothers' bedroom.\\
259 - No. This room is fine.\\
260 - I've had plenty of girls in here...\\
261 - Quit while you're ahead.\\
262 - That's good enough.\\
263 - No one's going to eat off it.\\
264 - Okay, maybe not in here.\\
265 - Mom...\\
266 - we need to talk.\\
267 - Um...\\
268 - we just got some interesting news from the doctor.\\
269 - Yes. It's, uh, very good news.\\
270 - Well, kind of good news.\\
271 - It's extreme news.\\
272 - I'm pregnant.\\
273 - You're joking.\\
274 - Believe me, we were as surprised as...\\
275 - as you are.\\
276 - Um, you know,\\
277 - we're already stretched to the limit financially.\\
278 - And, obviously, another baby is going\\
279 - to make things even harder for us.\\
280 - Yeah, so in light of that\\
281 - and the burden it's going to put on us,\\
282 - don't you think that certain actions should be reexamined?\\
283 - Yes. Yes, of course.\\
284 - You should settle.\\
285 - What?!\\
286 - Mom!\\
287 - It's for your own good.\\
288 - If you can't keep your legs closed for 20 minutes,\\
289 - at least take good advice when you hear it.\\
290 - Sleeping is the only thing that makes my life worthwhile.\\
291 - I can dream I'm somewhere decent.\\
292 - Hey, Malcolm, we need to borrow the tent\\
293 - for about an hour.\\
294 - Two hours.\\
295 - What? Why?\\
296 - None of your business. We just need it.\\
297 - No. It's bad enough I've been kicked out of the house.\\
298 - Now you want to take away the one place I have\\
299 - with just the tiniest piece of privacy?\\
300 - Forget it. Find your...\\
301 - Ow!\\
302 - Thanks, really.\\
303 - I hope you're happy.\\
304 - Forcing your own brother\\
305 - out into the night in his underwear.\\
306 - We're going to need that.\\
307 - What are we going to do?\\
308 - We're in debt up to our eyeballs as it is.\\
309 - Well, we're just going to have to cut back.\\
310 - No more vacations.\\
311 - Stop going out to fancy restaurants for birthdays.\\
312 - And, you know, it wouldn't kill us\\
313 - to stop wearing designer labels.\\
314 - Hal, whose life are you leading?\\
315 - We don't do any of that stuff.\\
316 - We can't afford this baby.\\
317 - Where's he going to sleep?\\
318 - We're not even going to be able to feed him\\
319 - after my mother gets finished with us.\\
320 - Oh, God, this is so unfair.\\
321 - Honey, relax.\\
322 - Here's what we're going to do.\\
323 - First, I'm going to go out\\
324 - and get you some mint chocolate chip ice cream.\\
325 - Now, that always helps.\\
326 - And then we're just going to sit down\\
327 - and figure this all out, hmm?\\
328 - Hey, everything is going to be okay, hmm?\\
329 - We'll find a way.\\
330 - We always do.\\
331 - Promise.\\
332 - Oh, no!\\
333 - Why me?!\\
334 - No.\\
335 - Why?! Why?!\\
336 - Why?! Why, why,\\
337 - why, why?!\\
338 - Why?!\\
339 - Oh, why?!\\
340 - Okay, I'm really getting sick of this.\\
341 - Nobody should know a beetle tastes better than a june bug.\\
342 - Can I have more pancakes?\\
343 - You've had ten already, Reese.\\
344 - Don't be a pig.\\
345 - We need to save\\
346 - every penny we can.\\
347 - Dewey, go easy on the orange juice.\\
348 - That stuff doesn't grow on...\\
349 - Wait, it does.\\
350 - So, why is it so damn expensive?\\
351 - Yeah, Dewey, you wouldn't want to be greedy.\\
352 - A greedy, conniving old lady\\
353 - who doesn't have a shred of decency in her entire body.\\
354 - The hooligan talks of decency.\\
355 - How amusing.\\
356 - Why is that amusing?\\
357 - None of your business.\\
358 - Okay.\\
359 - Hal, I need to talk to you\\
360 - about, uh... the thing.\\
361 - Which thing?\\
362 - The first thing,\\
363 - or the other thing?\\
364 - They know about the thing.\\
365 - Shut up.\\
366 - It's probably a different thing.\\
367 - I just got off the phone with the insurance company.\\
368 - They say that our rates are going to triple.\\
369 - What?!\\
370 - Even putting in the claim\\
371 - is going to cost us. Triple?!\\
372 - Oh...\\
373 - Well, I guess we should probably tell the kids.\\
374 - Who knows, they might have a few bucks we can borrow.\\
375 - No, let's not tell them yet.\\
376 - I know my mother.\\
377 - I know that if we give her one last chance,\\
378 - she'll do the right thing.\\
379 - I just know it.\\
380 - And you understand\\
381 - everything I've explained to you\\
382 - about the deposition process?\\
383 - Yes.\\
384 - You don't have to do that.\\
385 - Sorry.\\
386 - No, no, no, no, no, sorry, Malcolm.\\
387 - You can't come in right now.\\
388 - What are you talking about? I live here.\\
389 - Sorry, you just can't.\\
390 - Now I can't even go into my own house?\\
391 - Why am I always the one singled out for abuse?\\
392 - Reese and Dewey are in there.\\
393 - No, they're not.\\
394 - Francis and Piama took them miniature golfing.\\
395 - And moreover, being of sound mind and body\\
396 - and with... just cause... wait.\\
397 - Strike that. Sir, we just\\
398 - need you to state your name.\\
399 - I'm sorry I had to do that,\\
400 - but I had no other choice.\\
401 - I am still a member of this family,\\
402 - no matter how hard you're trying to forget it,\\
403 - and I deserve the right to know what's going on around here.\\
404 - Malcolm, this does not concern you!\\
405 - Yes, it does! There's something\\
406 - really weird happening in this house,\\
407 - and all I'm asking\\
408 - is for the courtesy\\
409 - of not being treated like an idiot.\\
410 - Well, your evil grandmother is suing us!\\
411 - Did you hear that?\\
412 - He called me evil.\\
413 - I want that on record.\\
414 - Okay, so she's suing us.\\
415 - You don't have to keep that from me.\\
416 - It's horrible, but\\
417 - everything she does is horrible.\\
418 - There's no reason...\\
419 - And your mother is pregnant.\\
420 - Pregnant?! Are you nuts?!\\
421 - That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!\\
422 - How could you do that to me, to all of us?!\\
423 - What the hell were you thinking?!\\
424 - All clear?\\
425 - I kept them out as long as I could,\\
426 - but $10 doesn't buy a whole lot of mini-golf.\\
427 - You knew about this and didn't tell us?\\
428 - Tell us what?\\
429 - Oh, it's here!\\
430 - Maybe we should take a five-minute break.\\
431 - I don't pay for breaks.\\
432 - Mom made me promise not to tell you.\\
433 - For some reason, she was trying to protect Grandma.\\
434 - What does Grandma have to do with Mom being pregnant?\\
435 - What, you're pregnant?\\
436 - No...!\\
437 - You're having another kid?\\
438 - What is wrong with you two?!\\
439 - You don't have enough problems as it is?!\\
440 - I can't believe you boys.\\
441 - This is the way you react to wonderful news?!\\
442 - This is a blessing!\\
443 - You should be ashamed of yourselves!\\
444 - Psst. I need to talk to you.\\
445 - What?\\
446 - Well, we don't have to worry\\
447 - about our insurance premiums going up.\\
448 - They just canceled our policy.\\
449 - What are you talking about?\\
450 - They said something about too many late payments.\\
451 - Some kind of loophole.\\
452 - So, whatever your mom gets\\
453 - we have to pay out of our own pocket.\\
454 - Oh, my God!\\
455 - I have good news.\\
456 - You know how everybody's\\
457 - been so depressed around here lately?\\
458 - Well, I was thinking.\\
459 - What could I do to cheer everyone up?\\
460 - And then it hit me.\\
461 - It was the most obvious thing in the world.\\
462 - I bought us an above-ground swimming pool.\\
463 - And the best part is\\
464 - you don't have to pay for it for six months.\\
465 - It's a raft with cup holders.\\
466 - They're setting the pool up right now.\\
467 - Oh, and don't just thank me.\\
468 - Dewey was in on it, too.\\
469 - He's lying! Huh?\\
470 - Wh-What's going on?\\
471 - Mom's pregnant.\\
472 - What?! You can't do that!\\
473 - Do you know how dangerous it is to have a baby and a pool?\\
474 - All right, that's it!\\
475 - Boys, get to your room right now.\\
476 - And you, you get that truck out of my backyard.\\
477 - I can't believe it. Another baby?\\
478 - They're nuts!\\
479 - None of us gets enough of anything as it is.\\
480 - Now we're going to have to split it five ways?\\
481 - What are you guys complaining about?\\
482 - All I ever had was being the youngest.\\
483 - Now I won't even have that.\\
484 - You guys don't get it.\\
485 - You're only looking at this in the short term.\\
486 - We're screwed for life.\\
487 - And I actually had some potential.\\
488 - I could have gone to college.\\
489 - Listen to you guys.\\
490 - Nice family this kid is going to be born into.\\
491 - Hey, we're allowed to be upset.\\
492 - We're the ones getting left out while every resource\\
493 - this family has is going to our baby brother.\\
494 - Brother?\\
495 - How much is she costing me?\\
496 - I'm not paying for your little tart of a girlfriend.\\
497 - Mother, we need to talk.\\
498 - Ida, we have no insurance.\\
499 - We were late on our payments, and they canceled us.\\
500 - If you don't stop\\
501 - this lawsuit, we'll be ruined, do you understand?\\
502 - I'm sure you'll manage somehow.\\
503 - There are agencies.\\
504 - Welfare.\\
505 - But who is there to help me, huh? Nobody.\\
506 - Mom, Dad,\\
507 - we just want to tell you that we were sorry\\
508 - for the way we acted about the baby.\\
509 - Yeah. We figured it out.\\
510 - Reese and I can double up in the bed again.\\
511 - And I could sleep with the baby.\\
512 - It'll be fun having a busy box again.\\
513 - Yeah, and I could probably send home\\
514 - 30 bucks a week to help out.\\
515 - Thank you, boys.\\
516 - Hello! This lawsuit isn't going to go away\\
517 - just 'cause you ignore me.\\
518 - Where do you think you're going?\\
519 - I'm out of here.\\
520 - They have no insurance.\\
521 - What do you think, I'm going to take 40 percent\\
522 - of this rundown dump of a house?\\
523 - 30 percent, and yes.\\
524 - Let me explain something to you.\\
525 - This house would fit in my house as a garage,\\
526 - but then I'd have to park my Porsche in the driveway.\\
527 - Now, I don't mind tossing innocent people\\
528 - into the street.\\
529 - I just don't do it for free.\\
530 - I think I feel well enough to travel.\\
531 - Francis and Grandma are finally gone,\\
532 - and everything's back to normal.\\
533 - Well, not exactly normal.\\
534 - Dad told us that during the first trimester of pregnancy\\
535 - women sometimes get a tiny bit hormonal.\\
536 - Quick, boys!\\
537 - Someone left the cap off the toothpaste!
\subsection {Episode 10: If Boys Were Girls}
1 - So apparently, there's a risk\\
2 - of extra blood loss with a cesarean section,\\
3 - but Dr. Howard is pretty sure I can deliver vaginally.\\
4 - He says I have\\
5 - a nice, thick placenta.\\
6 - What's a placenta?\\
7 - Don't tell him. God!\\
8 - Why are you boys being so squeamish?\\
9 - Come on, Mom. It's  gross!\\
10 - What are you talking about?\\
11 - You should be grateful.\\
12 - When you were in my womb,\\
13 - you were feeding off my placenta for nine months.\\
14 - Okay, that's it.\\
15 - I told you we only needed a medium.\\
16 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
17 -     I don't know    \\
18 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     And you're not so big    \\
27 -     Life is unfair.    \\
28 - Lois, you're not being fair. Every year you tell me\\
29 - what you want for Valentine's Day-- every year.\\
30 - Now, this year you want me to buy you a present\\
31 - without so much as a clue?\\
32 - Can we discuss this later?\\
33 - When? After I've brought home\\
34 - a gift you hate\\
35 - that makes me look like a jackass\\
36 - and you never forgive me?\\
37 - Here, mint or original?\\
38 - I don't remember the morning sickness\\
39 - lasting this long.\\
40 - Well, you are a lot older.\\
41 - Honey, you know, like we all are.\\
42 - I mean, that's what happens-- everyone gets older\\
43 - and older until they die...\\
44 - and can we get back to your gift?\\
45 - Hal, you're going to have at least four hours at the mall\\
46 - while I'm shopping with the boys.\\
47 - You'll find something.\\
48 - This isn't fair.\\
49 - You want to trade?\\
50 - You want to take\\
51 - three teenage boys to the basement sale\\
52 - at Hanning's and force them to try on\\
53 - a year's worth of school clothes?\\
54 - No, I'm good.\\
55 - Oh, God. My feet are so swollen,\\
56 - I'm going to need clown shoes.\\
57 - I can't believe I'm going through this again.\\
58 - So, a boy or a girl?\\
59 - What?\\
60 - Oh, come on-- just between us,\\
61 - would you rather have a boy or a girl?\\
62 - Hal... Oh, I know, I know.\\
63 - "As long as it's healthy." We both know the drill.\\
64 - But deep down,\\
65 - you must want one more than the other.\\
66 - Well...\\
67 - I'll get the vacuum.\\
68 - You broke my Space Fighter!\\
69 - Give it! You give it!\\
70 - What is going on here?\\
71 - He stole my pen!\\
72 - My favorite pen!\\
73 - Look at him holding it!\\
74 - Why is it  he  always gets the pen?\\
75 - I never get the pen!\\
76 - All I want is the pen!\\
77 - What is wrong with you boys?\\
78 - You have a whole drawer full of pens right here.\\
79 - Why does he have to have\\
80 - everything I want?! I never have what I need!\\
81 - I don't even have my own bed!\\
82 - Why does everything\\
83 - in my life suck?!\\
84 - You owe me a new Space Fighter!\\
85 - Shut up and get your own pen!\\
86 - Give it to me! Give it to me!\\
87 - Give it to me!\\
88 - Renee, please don't touch it.\\
89 - Mallory, you're being silly. It's just a pen.\\
90 - I was going to do homework with it.\\
91 - Unless there's a reason\\
92 - this pen's important to you.\\
93 - It's stupid.\\
94 - No, it isn't, Mallory.\\
95 - You can tell her.\\
96 - Daisy's right. You can tell me.\\
97 - How come you never say what's on your mind?\\
98 - Yeah, you're always so quiet.\\
99 - Well...\\
100 - this boy dropped it in biology class.\\
101 - He chewed on it a little.\\
102 - Oh, I am so sorry.\\
103 - I should have known that.\\
104 - I hate being dumb.\\
105 - If I didn't grow such great hair,\\
106 - my head would be useless.\\
107 - You don't have to be a genius.\\
108 - You're sweet and thoughtful...\\
109 - and that's what counts.\\
110 - Aw.\\
111 - Wow.\\
112 - That was the worst fight we've had in  months.\\
113 - Why don't you just  die?!\\
114 - Give me my pen! I'm warning you...\\
115 - Ooh, I'm scared.\\
116 - What are you gonna do?\\
117 - What's the baby gonna do?\\
118 - Malcolm!\\
119 - Malcolm, you can take Reese?\\
120 - No one's "taking" anybody.\\
121 - I can't believe you boys.\\
122 - Oh, my God, look at you!\\
123 - He'd better not need stitches.\\
124 - Yeah, like you weren't begging for it.\\
125 - Come on!\\
126 - We got a lot of shopping to do!\\
127 - Hello.\\
128 - Mom! Great! Listen, I need a favor.\\
129 - I need you to go in the garage.\\
130 - Under the paint tarps, next to the rat poison,\\
131 - is my old box of  Mad Magazines, and the one I need you to find\\
132 - is in the middle stack.\\
133 - Francis, what are you talking about?\\
134 - I got a $20 bet on whether the cover is "Stagnum P.I."\\
135 - or "Magnum P.U."\\
136 - Francis, I don't have time for this.\\
137 - Oh, of course you don't\\
138 - 'cause every time\\
139 - something important to me comes up...\\
140 - Will you hurry up?\\
141 - We're going to have park, like, a mile away!\\
142 - Why do we have to go shopping, anyway?\\
143 - Because you ruin everything you own.\\
144 - New clothes don't just magically appear in your drawers.\\
145 - Mine do.\\
146 - Hal, hurry up!\\
147 - Why can't you go shopping without us?\\
148 - I'm a medium, I like blue. Go crazy.\\
149 - Seriously, Mom, think about it--\\
150 - you're dragging us to a place\\
151 - that we don't like,\\
152 - to buy clothes we don't care about,\\
153 - for money you don't want to spend,\\
154 - to look nice for people who hate our guts.\\
155 - And if we go to the shoe store\\
156 - before we look for jeans,\\
157 - we can get yogurt in between.\\
158 - Mom, will you help me pick out earrings?\\
159 - No, she's gonna help me pick out tops.\\
160 - You know what we should do?\\
161 - You two take the first floor,\\
162 - and we'll take the second floor,\\
163 - and we'll meet every 45 minutes\\
164 - at the pretzel place and see what else\\
165 - we need to get, and then...\\
166 - Girls, girls,\\
167 - calm down.\\
168 - We do this, like, five times a week.\\
169 - You think you'd be bored by now.\\
170 - I know why Mallory wants to meet at the pretzel place.\\
171 - That's where Jason McNeil works.\\
172 - Daisy!\\
173 - That's  who you have a crush on? Jason?\\
174 - Maybe. Mallory, he has a mustache.\\
175 - You don't want anything to do\\
176 - with a boy like that.\\
177 - You're always so protective of me.\\
178 - Come on, Daddy, hurry.\\
179 - Dad, come on, the mall is calling!\\
180 - Damn it. That's enough!\\
181 - Now, we are going shopping, and that is it!\\
182 - I don't even need new clothes!\\
183 - I don't even want to go the mall!\\
184 - Do you want big, do you want small?\\
185 - Do you want for you?\\
186 - Do you want for the house?\\
187 - Do you want sincere...?\\
188 - Hal, you know what I like.\\
189 - Yes, because you've always told me!\\
190 - For the past five Valentine's Days,\\
191 - you've asked for a lawn mower,\\
192 - bath salts, earrings, a Hibachi,\\
193 - a porcelain cat.\\
194 - Th-There's no pattern, Lois.\\
195 - It is madness!\\
196 - I'm telling you, it's madness!\\
197 - Okay, I'm going to let you do this to yourself.\\
198 - My feet are killing me.\\
199 - We're going to hit the food court before the sale.\\
200 - Fine! Be that way!\\
201 - Don't come crying to me\\
202 - when you end up with a pair of puppy oven mitts!\\
203 - Do you like puppy oven mitts?!\\
204 - One salad with light dressing\\
205 - and three grande chili stampedes--\\
206 - one with extra onions,\\
207 - one with extra beans and extra onions,\\
208 - and one with extra beans and extra, extra onions.\\
209 - You've shot down my star-pod\\
210 - for the last time, Zoltan.\\
211 - What you gonna do?\\
212 - What's the baby gonna do, huh?\\
213 - Aah! My lip!\\
214 - Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!\\
215 - It hurts!\\
216 - I don't want a hat, Hal.\\
217 - Damn.\\
218 - Okay, if one of you boys wants to get napkins,\\
219 - we can start...\\
220 - Boy, keep the windows open tonight,\\
221 - 'cause I'm gonna rip\\
222 - the biggest...\\
223 - ...hole in my sweater.\\
224 - Look at this.\\
225 - I think I snagged it on something.\\
226 - I hate when I ruin my things.\\
227 - Remember when I was two and I got cake on my jumper?\\
228 - Don't worry.\\
229 - I snagged a blouse once.\\
230 - That's when Mom taught me how to sew.\\
231 - Why isn't Daddy back\\
232 - from the pharmacy yet?\\
233 - I'll bet he's sneaking a cigarette.\\
234 - Now, you girls let him be.\\
235 - Sometimes he just needs a break.\\
236 - It's not easy being the only boy in the family.\\
237 - Oh, look.\\
238 - Hi, honey, we're over here.\\
239 - Hi, Daddy.\\
240 - Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy.\\
241 - Hi, girls. Sorry it took so long.\\
242 - No one's upset with me, are they?\\
243 - Bought everyone some cookies.\\
244 - Oh... they're gone.\\
245 - Daddy, you know how you like\\
246 - to make me happy?\\
247 - Yes?\\
248 - Well, there is the cutest\\
249 - little makeup kit at the Clinique counter.\\
250 - Oh, honey, no.\\
251 - Now, absolutely not.\\
252 - I don't even like\\
253 - you wearing makeup,\\
254 - and that stuff is so overpriced.\\
255 - And what's such a hurry... ?\\
256 - Hal, it's all right.\\
257 - Mallory, stop manipulating your father.\\
258 - You know there's no sport in it.\\
259 - She wants to look pretty for Jason.\\
260 - Who's Jason?\\
261 - Daddy, keep your voice down.\\
262 - He's right over there.\\
263 - God, I can't believe you.\\
264 - I don't know what you see in that guy.\\
265 - Daddy, don't you think\\
266 - Mallory should be with someone else?\\
267 - No. Well, that's easy for you to say.\\
268 - You have, like, 50 guys after you.\\
269 - 50?!\\
270 - All right, girls, that's enough.\\
271 - Now, Renee, I know you love your sister,\\
272 - but you can't live her life for her.\\
273 - And, Mallory,\\
274 - I know you want to look older and more sophisticated,\\
275 - but trust me...\\
276 - that three-dollar lip gloss is working just fine.\\
277 - You're right, Mom.\\
278 - You're  always  right.\\
279 - Hey, I was gonna eat that!\\
280 - Tough luck!\\
281 - What the hell's wrong with you?!\\
282 - No.\\
283 - Damn.\\
284 - Can I help you?\\
285 - Don't do it.\\
286 - Thank you.\\
287 - All right, we're going in.\\
288 - You see anything in your size, grab it and hold on to it,\\
289 - no matter what anyone tries to do to you.\\
290 - Protect your heads. Don't trust anyone.\\
291 - What are you trying to do, scare us?\\
292 - Yes. Fear is good.\\
293 - It's an 80%-off sale.\\
294 - Fear will keep you alive.\\
295 - Don't worry. We're with Malcolm.\\
296 - Ooh.\\
297 - Oh...\\
298 - Oh, the foot spa. Those are good, right?\\
299 - Oh, yeah, they're amazing.\\
300 - I already have two.\\
301 - This one's for my downstairs bathroom.\\
302 - Well, enjoy.\\
303 - I would like the deluxe foot spa with remote control,\\
304 - and I'd like it gift-wrapped, please.\\
305 - I'm sorry. That was our last one.\\
306 - No! Well, what about the one in the window?\\
307 - It's a display model. It's just a shell.\\
308 - But you have to...\\
309 - I need the... the perfect...\\
310 - My wife...\\
311 - Sir! Sir!\\
312 - Excuse me. Hi.\\
313 - I'm Hal, remember?\\
314 - Your friend from just now in the store.\\
315 - Yeah, hi. Hi.\\
316 - I was trying to get one of those foot spas for my wife.\\
317 - Oh, really?\\
318 - Yeah, my pregnant wife.\\
319 - For Valentine's Day, you know.\\
320 - And apparently, you bought the last one.\\
321 - So, I was wondering, since you already have two,\\
322 - uh, if you wouldn't mind selling me that one.\\
323 - No, I don't think so. Sorry.\\
324 - Look, you don't understand.\\
325 - I have been searching and searching.\\
326 - I'll give you double what you paid for.\\
327 - No! I'll give you triple.\\
328 - Look, I'm sorry, but no.\\
329 - This is mine. I bought it.\\
330 - I'm sure if you just keep looking around,\\
331 - you'll find something else.\\
332 - Oh, okay, okay.\\
333 - Um, ah, how about this?\\
334 - I can see through that old lady's bra.\\
335 - We've got to get out of here before we're scarred for life.\\
336 - Come on.\\
337 - Hey, Mom, we've...\\
338 - You did not already try on those clothes.\\
339 - And you do not have a term paper due, and you are not\\
340 - going to suddenly develop stomach cramps.\\
341 - How did you...? Please, who do you think\\
342 - you're talking to?\\
343 - Now, go, try on those clothes.\\
344 - Reese.\\
345 - Takes these and go with your brother.\\
346 - Mom, what are you doing?\\
347 - Why are you giving me a pink shirt?\\
348 - I don't wear pink. I've never worn pink.\\
349 - That shirt is red.\\
350 - If you have something to say, just come out and say it.\\
351 - For the love of God, I'll find you another one.\\
352 - Excuse me.\\
353 - Wow, what happened to your face?\\
354 - I slept on it wrong.\\
355 - What do you mean?\\
356 - Well, I'm sleeping like this,\\
357 - and then my knee went up into my elbow,\\
358 - and my elbow hit my hand and it went in my mouth,\\
359 - and no one hit me, okay?\\
360 - I don't want to hear any more of your whining.\\
361 - You try this on right now, understood?!\\
362 - Why are you standing here?\\
363 - You're wasting time.\\
364 - I'm not changing out here in front of everybody.\\
365 - You know what? I don't even need new clothes.\\
366 - I'll just live off the lost and found at school.\\
367 - It's all better than this crap anyway.\\
368 - Mom, Mom, there you are.\\
369 - Look, it's a $200 dress they marked down to $30.\\
370 - Oh, my God. This is like a dream.\\
371 - Mom, you will not believe this.\\
372 - I had Daisy dig through the cabinets\\
373 - under the sales table, and we found all this stuff\\
374 - they were saving to put out for tomorrow.\\
375 - Yeah, we've got all the clothes we need for the whole year.\\
376 - Good work, girls.\\
377 - Uh-oh, look who's here.\\
378 - You know, I wouldn't be insulted if you wanted\\
379 - to go for an ice cream with him.\\
380 - Maybe later.\\
381 - This is our special day, Mom.\\
382 - Yeah, and we haven't even gotten to the best part yet.\\
383 - When we help find things for  you.\\
384 - I can't really describe him.\\
385 - He was just an average-looking guy,\\
386 - but he had kind of crazy eyes.\\
387 - Is that helpful?\\
388 - Sir, I'm so sorry.\\
389 - I don't know what came over me earlier.\\
390 - I'm really not that kind of person.\\
391 - I-I just think it was all the pressure of Valentine's Day,\\
392 - and I was so upset and irrational.\\
393 - But the bottom line is that I made a mistake and...\\
394 - grabbed the wrong bag!\\
395 - Oh, God...\\
396 - Look at him. Yeah.\\
397 - I assume you'll want the same deal I had with him.\\
398 - What are you talking about?\\
399 - Look, Reese is as good\\
400 - as dead, at least on the inside.\\
401 - That puts you in charge.\\
402 - You get half my candy,\\
403 - full control of the remote,\\
404 - and since I can't do your  homework for you,\\
405 - how about a nice warm towel\\
406 - whenever you come out of the shower?\\
407 - Will you shut up? He's going to be fine.\\
408 - Whatever you say... sir.\\
409 - Come on.\\
410 - Hey.\\
411 - I'm sorry, I was here first.\\
412 - No, you weren't. We're next.\\
413 - I'll only take a minute.\\
414 - I've only got two things to try on.\\
415 - Lady, we've been waiting in line for a half hour.\\
416 - We have to meet our mom.\\
417 - I'm sorry, but we're next.\\
418 - Back off, brat!\\
419 - This may be your first sale,\\
420 - but it isn't mine!\\
421 - Let him go.\\
422 - It's our turn.\\
423 - Looks like you need someone\\
424 - to teach you to mind your elders.\\
425 - You looking for a dance partner?\\
426 - You think you can do\\
427 - whatever you want, don't you?\\
428 - That people aren't going to say\\
429 - or do anything because you're... "frail."\\
430 - Deal's off.\\
431 - All right, Reese is back.\\
432 - You want to take your teeth out before we start this, Grandma?\\
433 - Oh, no, Reese is back.\\
434 - Hi, I'm Karen Tracy.\\
435 - I was speaking to one of your boys earlier.\\
436 - Oh, my God, I'll kill him.\\
437 - See, these kind of outbursts\\
438 - are exactly the sort of thing we can help you with.\\
439 - I'm with the Department of Child Services.\\
440 - What? What are you talking about?\\
441 - Look, we're not making any judgments yet,\\
442 - but the department takes\\
443 - the safety of children very seriously.\\
444 - I'd like you to come in for an evaluation.\\
445 - What's the last known\\
446 - address of the boy's father?\\
447 - Wait a minute. This is a mistake.\\
448 - My boys are fine.\\
449 - It wasn't me-- somebody planted\\
450 - those teeth on me.\\
451 - These your kids?\\
452 - I was just trying to buy a slip,\\
453 - and they all jumped on me like jackals.\\
454 - She's lying.\\
455 - We were just trying to pull Reese off of her.\\
456 - Oh, Lois, thank God I found you.\\
457 - Look, we got to get out of here before...\\
458 - Run!\\
459 - Mom, seriously, get the lead out!\\
460 - You must be so happy.\\
461 - You wouldn't believe some of the families\\
462 - I have to deal with.\\
463 - Oh, girls.\\
464 - Hurry up.\\
465 - It's our turn at the register.\\
466 - I can't decide between the peach, the melon or the salmon.\\
467 - I just have to get all three.\\
468 - No, honey, now you're going to make a choice.\\
469 - Gee, Mom, if you're going to force me\\
470 - to wear knock-offs, can I at least\\
471 - just get what I want?\\
472 - Here you go, sweetie.\\
473 - Here's the makeup you wanted.\\
474 - Oh, thank you so much, Daddy.\\
475 - Hal, what are you doing?\\
476 - We said she couldn't have that.\\
477 - Well, she asked me again\\
478 - and told me that you said it would be okay after all,\\
479 - and then, you know, she started...\\
480 - getting all teary-eyed.\\
481 - You know, I... I-I just... I...\\
482 - Mallory, how could you do that?\\
483 - Don't worry, Mom. I won't wear it around the house.\\
484 - I know how desperate you are to be the prettiest.\\
485 - Mallory, I think we're all getting a little bit frazzled.\\
486 - Why don't we\\
487 - talk about this when\\
488 - we're modeling our clothes for each other at home.\\
489 - Yeah, that's really good, Mom,\\
490 - because by that time the buzz from her diet pills\\
491 - will have worn off.\\
492 - Diet pills?\\
493 - I have a slow metabolism, okay?\\
494 - And I don't burn up calories having sex with a different boy\\
495 - every night down by the creek.\\
496 - I thought you were at band practice every night.\\
497 - There is no band!\\
498 - Shut up, flatsy patsy, you don't know anything.\\
499 - I know you're pregnant.\\
500 - She is lying. That is ridiculous.\\
501 - I am not pregnant, because I know\\
502 - that sex is wrong and immoral and fun.\\
503 - No, wait...\\
504 - It's all right, Renee.\\
505 - It's good that they know.\\
506 - I'm ready for teenage marriage.\\
507 - It'll be awesome.\\
508 - He's the father?\\
509 - You only slept with him\\
510 - because you knew that I liked him!\\
511 - Maybe you should have asked to use my hair brush first.\\
512 - Girls, please, can you just...?\\
513 - Girls, don't do this.\\
514 - You're supposed to be easy.\\
515 - No, Mom, you're easy.\\
516 - We can fool you about anything.\\
517 - We're girls. We know how you think.\\
518 - And we're not above using it.\\
519 - Mom, Dad, hi.\\
520 - Francis, what are you doing here?\\
521 - You're supposed to be away at college.\\
522 - I dropped out, but don't worry, I'm working.\\
523 - At the new Hooters out by the lumberyard.\\
524 - With tips, I can\\
525 - pay rent on the trailer\\
526 - and still keep my husband in beer.\\
527 - Hey, got to go.\\
528 - Cockfight starts in half an hour.\\
529 - You still got to load the cages into my pickup.\\
530 - Uh, you know, you could talk to my daughter...\\
531 - Leave him alone!\\
532 - You never like\\
533 - any of my husbands.\\
534 - You've always tried to come between us,\\
535 - and that's why I hate you!\\
536 - Ever since you lost\\
537 - all that weight,\\
538 - nothing is ever good enough for you!\\
539 - This isn't right.\\
540 - Girls don't do these things.\\
541 - Girls are nicer.\\
542 - Girls are better.\\
543 - Oh, come off it.\\
544 - Who do you think made us this way?\\
545 - It's all your fault.\\
546 - Honey, come on, you can do it.\\
547 - It's just another 300 yards after Se  or Jelly Bean's.\\
548 - Trust me, Hal. There's no escape.\\
549 - There's no escape no matter what.\\
550 - Happy Valentine's Day, honey.\\
551 - It finally came to me last night.\\
552 - The perfect gift.\\
553 - And I know you'll love it because it's not for you.\\
554 - Thank you, Hal. It's perfect.\\
555 - Come on, Dad, let's go.\\
556 - Oh, I get Malcolm.\\
557 - Wait, we almost forgot the thing.\\
558 - Happy Valentine's Day, Mom.\\
559 - Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.\\
560 - We saved you the coconut ones\\
561 - 'cause we know they're you're favorite.\\
562 - Thank you, boys. I love it.\\
563 - See you in a bit.\\
564 - I hope you're a girl.
\subsection {Episode 11: Long Drive}
1 - I can't believe we're locked out.\\
2 - Mom won't be home until 6:00.\\
3 - Hang on. I know how to get in.\\
4 - Here it is.\\
5 - I'll do it.\\
6 - Thanks.\\
7 - That credit card thing takes hours.\\
8 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
9 -     I don't know    \\
10 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     Life is unfair.    \\
20 - Why do you have to take your pillow to your sister's?\\
21 - Well, Hal, I don't know how long I'm going to be there.\\
22 - I want to be comfortable.\\
23 - Well, what am I supposed to sniff while you're gone?\\
24 - Mom's baby doctor is making her move\\
25 - to her sister's house for a while.\\
26 - Dad's starting to get used to it.\\
27 - At least now he goes out to the garage to cry.\\
28 - Aha! No coaster.\\
29 - Look at that ring.\\
30 - That is why I have to move out of this house.\\
31 - Mom.\\
32 - Every time you boys thoughtlessly\\
33 - mar the furniture by refusing to use coasters,\\
34 - what are you doing?\\
35 - Killing the baby.\\
36 - Killing the baby.\\
37 - Every time you run through the house,\\
38 - every time you destroy furniture,\\
39 - every time you fight with each other,\\
40 - you are killing the baby.\\
41 - Lois, the doctor just said\\
42 - you should avoid stress.\\
43 - Which is just medical jargon for the simple fact\\
44 - that every time you boys misbehave,\\
45 - you might as well be taking a knife\\
46 - and putting it in that baby's tiny little heart.\\
47 - Will you stop saying that?\\
48 - I just hope you boys have the character\\
49 - to channel the horrible guilt you should be feeling\\
50 - into better behavior while I'm gone.\\
51 - We're sorry. Okay. Yes, Mom.\\
52 - Oh, my God.\\
53 - I don't think I can keep this up.\\
54 - It's just a few more days until she leaves.\\
55 - We can laugh all we want\\
56 - when she's backing out of the driveway.\\
57 - We're not really hurting the baby, are we?\\
58 - Please. A week before you were born,\\
59 - we tied our playpen to the back of her car\\
60 - and followed her to work.\\
61 - She's just trying to save face.\\
62 - She doesn't want to admit\\
63 - that we actually drove her from the house.\\
64 - And now we're in charge.\\
65 - Helga, this cheese is magnificent.\\
66 - Would you like to try just a little bite?\\
67 - No?\\
68 - How could you not like cheese?\\
69 - It is made from something that comes from you.\\
70 - Hey, Otto.\\
71 - Ooh. Francis.\\
72 - Have you seen Helga's squeaky toy?\\
73 - It's the one that looks like a little fire hydrant.\\
74 - No, but I did get in the new branding iron.\\
75 - Shh.\\
76 - Do you want to scare the poor thing out of her wits?\\
77 - Otto, I know how much you love Helga,\\
78 - but we have to do this.\\
79 - All the cows have to get branded and de-wormed.\\
80 - I promise I will be very careful.\\
81 - But don't tell her about it.\\
82 - You know, she is not as brave as she looks.\\
83 - I told her one ghost story around the campfire,\\
84 - and she had to sleep between me and Gretchen for a week.\\
85 -     And I don't give a damn    \\
86 -     About a greenback-a dollar    \\
87 -      Greenback dollar     \\
88 -     Spend it fast as I can    \\
89 -      As fast as I can     \\
90 -     For a wailin' song and a good guitar    \\
91 -     The only things that I understand    \\
92 -     Poor boy    \\
93 -     The only things    \\
94 -     That I understand.    \\
95 - Yes! All right!\\
96 - That little elbow move\\
97 - you added-- where did you come up with that?\\
98 - You got me. I was in the zone.\\
99 - All right, all right.\\
100 - Can we get back to work?\\
101 - What? That was perfect.\\
102 - Yeah. Yeah. Come on.\\
103 - Really? Was it so perfect\\
104 - that you are ready to go up on stage with it\\
105 - at the Elks Club Founders Dinner?\\
106 - What did you say?\\
107 - I've been waiting to tell you.\\
108 - I got us the gig!\\
109 - Impossible!\\
110 - They haven't taken a new act in years.\\
111 - It's easier to get on the waiting list\\
112 - for a new heart.\\
113 - I know, but this morning\\
114 - at the gas station, I saw Eddie Eigen.\\
115 - He come up to me to say hi, and he slipped on an oil stain.\\
116 - He can't perform.\\
117 - You're kidding. No, I tell you,\\
118 - it's like God backed up that minivan\\
119 - over his ventriloquist hand.\\
120 - So, Eddie uses\\
121 - my cell phone to cancel with the club.\\
122 - Two minutes later, I push redial and got us the gig.\\
123 - You are the man.\\
124 - I cannot believe you don't trust me, Daddy.\\
125 - I am not seeing Malcolm!\\
126 - I don't even like him.\\
127 - I haven't talked to him in over a month.\\
128 - Nicki's such a good liar.\\
129 - That's good in a girlfriend, right?\\
130 - He is such a jerk.\\
131 - I can't believe he's making us hang out in closets.\\
132 - Once my mom's gone,\\
133 - we can hang out at my house after school.\\
134 - Thank God.\\
135 - I can't get away with anything here.\\
136 - You were with that girl, weren't you?\\
137 - No! I was at the library studying.\\
138 - You were supposed\\
139 - to pick your brother up at school.\\
140 - There were rocks.\\
141 - There was a beehive.\\
142 - But where were you?\\
143 - You are not allowed to see that girl.\\
144 - Her name is Nicki, and I'm not seeing her.\\
145 - Every time you lie to me,\\
146 - it is like you are digging a tiny little grave.\\
147 - I am not lying to you!\\
148 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\\
149 - You know, Mom, you're looking lovely today.\\
150 - People don't appreciate\\
151 - how lovely you can be in the right light.\\
152 - I'm always telling kids at school\\
153 - that I have the loveliest mother.\\
154 - I'll put on the coffee.\\
155 - It's Henson.\\
156 - Make decaf.\\
157 - "A Day in Prison?"\\
158 - We have no choice.\\
159 - I am not leaving you here with Reese like this.\\
160 - It just sounds so scary.\\
161 - That's the point.\\
162 - You take them to prison,\\
163 - a bunch of criminals scream at them,\\
164 - and they come home good.\\
165 - Hey, they include a snack.\\
166 - There you go, Helga. Almost done.\\
167 - How's it going?\\
168 - Just finishing the de-worming.\\
169 - God, these fumes are horrible.\\
170 - All right, let's get this over with.\\
171 - Wait a minute. You didn't brand them first?\\
172 - No. Why?\\
173 - That'd be the main reason.\\
174 - Wow!\\
175 - The Founders Dinner.\\
176 - Three hours from now, we'll be singing on that stage.\\
177 - In the dessert slot!\\
178 - You can't beat that.\\
179 - No, you can't. Big time.\\
180 - Dewey, I have to focus,\\
181 - so I want you to sit and watch quietly\\
182 - right over here.\\
183 - Why do I have to be here?\\
184 - Why couldn't I go snowboarding with Reese?\\
185 - Reese isn't snowboarding.\\
186 - That was just a lie Mommy and Daddy told.\\
187 - Reese is in jail.\\
188 - For how long?\\
189 - A few hours.\\
190 - Oh.\\
191 - Since there was no contraband found on\\
192 - or inside your bodies,\\
193 - I think you're ready\\
194 - to meet some of the inmates now.\\
195 - This is Samuel.\\
196 - I would tell you what he's in here for,\\
197 - but it's against the law for me to say it to minors.\\
198 - Be with you in a minute.\\
199 - The ankles were a bit unnecessarily tight.\\
200 - All right, so we need\\
201 - to get a few of the ground rules\\
202 - straight.\\
203 - I own you!\\
204 - You are  my property!\\
205 - And you should know,\\
206 - I don't take very good care of my things.\\
207 - Stand up.\\
208 - I said stand up!\\
209 - Turn around!\\
210 - All the way.\\
211 - Faster!\\
212 - See that?\\
213 - Like a little top.\\
214 - Sit down!\\
215 - See how that works?\\
216 - 'Cause in prison,\\
217 - you got to make your own fun.\\
218 - And when they toss in punk kids like you and you,  whoo--\\
219 - it's like Christmas for me!\\
220 - If you displease me,\\
221 - I will not hesitate to grab you by your pretty little neck,\\
222 - just squeeze till your eyes\\
223 - bulge out of your head,\\
224 - and then pop them with a fork.\\
225 - You think that's funny?\\
226 - I thought you were  trying to be funny.\\
227 - So, I got me a volunteer, huh?\\
228 - Well, let me tell you, cupcakes,\\
229 - what your first day up in here gonna be like!\\
230 - And don't expect no flowers afterwards.\\
231 - Malcolm, we have to go!\\
232 - I'm sorry, Nicki.\\
233 - I've got to help my mom drop off the first load\\
234 - of her stuff at my aunt's house.\\
235 - There and back is like three hours,\\
236 - but when I get home, I'll sneak over.\\
237 - Malcolm!\\
238 - What were you doing in there?\\
239 - Finishing up my homework.\\
240 -     Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station    \\
241 -     Every day at quarter past two    \\
242 -     And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich    \\
243 -     As the train comes rumblin' through    \\
244 - Whoo! Whoo!\\
245 -     But did he ever return?    \\
246 -     No, he'll never return    \\
247 -     And his fate is still unlearned    \\
248 -     He may ride forever    \\
249 -     He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston    \\
250 -     He's the man who never returned    \\
251 -     Play that banjo, Steve-o    \\
252 -     Yeehaw!         Yip, yip, yeehaw!    \\
253 -     A-ha    \\
254 -     Or else he'll never return    \\
255 -     No, he'll never return    \\
256 -     And his fate is still unlearned    \\
257 -     Just like Paul Revere    \\
258 -     He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston    \\
259 -     He's the man who never returned    \\
260 -     He's the man who never returned.    \\
261 - So, what'd you think, Dewey?\\
262 - It's cool. It's fun the way you guys move. Yeah.\\
263 - How come you're always in the back?\\
264 - I'm not always in the...\\
265 - Well, even if I am, it-it's not about where anyone is.\\
266 - It's about what's best for the group.\\
267 - Okay. Yeah.\\
268 - Why is it best for the group\\
269 - to put you in the back?\\
270 - So, a three-hour drive.\\
271 - Should be nice.\\
272 - Uh-huh.\\
273 - We don't get to be alone\\
274 - that often anymore, just the two of us,\\
275 - and I've been wanting to talk to you.\\
276 - What are we going to talk about for three hours?\\
277 - Sex.\\
278 - Mom, don't do this! Malcolm, in a few days,\\
279 - I'm going to be gone for a very long time,\\
280 - and I need to know that you're okay.\\
281 - We are going to have this talk.\\
282 - I know about you and Nicki.\\
283 - I'm not seeing Nicki! I'm not having sex!\\
284 - I know about protection! I know all that stuff!\\
285 - Malcolm, there's a lot more\\
286 - to being a sexually responsible person\\
287 - than what they teach you in health class.\\
288 - It's very different when you're experiencing it yourself.\\
289 - Mom, stop.\\
290 - I'll do anything you ask.\\
291 - Just don't have this conversation.\\
292 - Oh, honey, it's going to happen.\\
293 - No.\\
294 - You think I like it?\\
295 - You think I like the embarrassment\\
296 - we're going to be feeling for the next few hours?\\
297 - But, Malcolm, I have no choice.\\
298 - I cannot be there when you are having sex.\\
299 - God! So I'm going to try to give you\\
300 - the benefit of my experience.\\
301 - I'm going to bury you with every piece of information I have.\\
302 - I don't know what will be helpful and what won't,\\
303 - so I'm just going to tell you everything.\\
304 - Oh, my God!\\
305 - The sooner we start, the sooner it'll be over with.\\
306 - Now, this is a diaphragm.\\
307 - Look, Otto keeps asking me where Helga is,\\
308 - and I'm running out of excuses.\\
309 - You got to tell him what happened.\\
310 - I know. I'm working on it.\\
311 - It's just a cow.\\
312 - A cow that's in his will.\\
313 - Francis, I've got to thank you for what you did to Helga.\\
314 - My budget is really tight,\\
315 - and getting a couple of extra sides of beef\\
316 - really helped me out.\\
317 - And how did you achieve that smoky flavor?\\
318 - That's great stuff, Arnold.\\
319 - Ray's dad has a week to live.\\
320 - Maybe you can do ten minutes on that.\\
321 - Otto, I have to tell you something.\\
322 - Francis, have you seen Helga?\\
323 - No, I haven't.\\
324 - It is not like her to wander off alone.\\
325 - I'm starting to get scared.\\
326 - Mmm!\\
327 - This is delicious.\\
328 - Do you think\\
329 - she ran away because she was angry with me?\\
330 - I don't think so.\\
331 - Well, I should have been there when you branded her.\\
332 - I could have held her little hoof.\\
333 - So tender, so moist.\\
334 - You must try some.\\
335 - Mm-hmm.\\
336 - Look at me, enjoying myself while my Helga is out there,\\
337 - alone and scared.\\
338 - That is it.\\
339 - I will go, and I will look for her,\\
340 - and I will find her,\\
341 - if I have to spend all night searching!\\
342 - Otto, if I don't say this right now,\\
343 - I am never going to say it.\\
344 - Yes, go ahead.\\
345 - Pass the b  arnaise sauce, please.\\
346 - Helga!\\
347 - Helga,  meine Liebchen!\\
348 - Helga!\\
349 - All that crap you "tough" guys have been pulling,\\
350 - well, this is where it's got you!\\
351 - This is...\\
352 - Are you paying attention?!\\
353 - No. I just realized.\\
354 - You're in prison.\\
355 - You're locked up in here for life.\\
356 - What do I need to be afraid of  you  for?\\
357 - Because the way you've been screwing up,\\
358 - you're likely to end up in here,\\
359 - and when that happens,  whoo-wee!\\
360 - You know, Sammy, you might want to have someone\\
361 - smuggle some mouthwash in a cake.\\
362 - Let me tell you what happened to the last guy\\
363 - who made fun of me.\\
364 - They found just enough of him to convict me!\\
365 - Ooh! I am so scared of prison boy.\\
366 - What are you going to do,\\
367 - stretch out your arms 70 miles through the bars\\
368 - to my house?\\
369 - And if the sperm doesn't take,\\
370 - the uterine wall sloughs off cells,\\
371 - and that's what creates a period.\\
372 - Women can be very emotional at that time,\\
373 - but God help you if you point it out\\
374 - because then you're creating two problems...\\
375 -     Me-may-ma-mo- me-may-ma-mo-moo    \\
376 -     Me-may-ma-mo-me- may-ma-mo-moo...    \\
377 - I hope I don't get too nervous tonight.\\
378 - Kitty bought a new antiperspirant\\
379 - I don't have much confidence in.\\
380 - No one will even notice if  I  sweat.\\
381 - Since I'm in the back the whole time.\\
382 - I'm in the back for every song, you know.\\
383 - And frankly, I don't think that's fair.\\
384 - We all agreed on the choreography, Hal.\\
385 - Where is this coming from?\\
386 - From the back, that's where!\\
387 - You have such a good voice.\\
388 - Why don't you ever sing lead?\\
389 - I don't know.\\
390 - I was told I sound a little throaty\\
391 - in my upper register.\\
392 - Are you the leader?\\
393 - Well, there's no leader.\\
394 - We make all our decisions as a group.\\
395 - I don't remember any "group" vote on these sweaters.\\
396 - Hey, we all agreed on these sweaters!\\
397 - You like these sweaters, don't you?\\
398 - Yes, I do.\\
399 - What's he going to say?\\
400 - "My brother-in-law, who's the only reason\\
401 - "I'm in the group in the first place,\\
402 - picked out ugly sweaters"?!\\
403 - Excuse me?! Dewey,\\
404 - what do you think of these sweaters?\\
405 - I like them. They're funny.\\
406 - Oh, see?!\\
407 - We're going to look ridiculous tonight!\\
408 - Well, it doesn't matter\\
409 - how I look.\\
410 - No one's going to be able to see me!\\
411 - Oh, for heaven's sake!\\
412 - Maybe if you guys worried more about your voices\\
413 - and less about your sweaters...\\
414 - Oh, now you're criticizing my singing?!\\
415 - Puh-lease. You can't say your name\\
416 - without changing keys.\\
417 - I think Malik sings beautifully!\\
418 - Of course you do.\\
419 - You're tone deaf!\\
420 - Well, at least when I dance,\\
421 - it doesn't look like I hooked my butt up\\
422 - to a paint mixer!\\
423 - Oh! Oh, that's it!\\
424 - You can go up here without me tonight!\\
425 - I won't be here either!\\
426 - Neither will I!\\
427 - Me, neither!\\
428 - I don't know why it took so long\\
429 - for the scales to fall from my eyes!\\
430 - And to reveal you as you really are!\\
431 - And believe me, it's a lot more sensitive\\
432 - than most men understand.\\
433 - A little bit goes a long way.\\
434 - Helga!\\
435 - Oh, we will never find her!\\
436 - And it's all my fault!\\
437 - No, Otto, it's not. It's my fault.\\
438 - I have to tell you this.\\
439 - There was an accident, a tragic branding accident.\\
440 - I killed Helga, and I fed her to you,\\
441 - and I couldn't be more sorry.\\
442 - What?\\
443 - She's gone.\\
444 - She's dead.\\
445 - I don't think she suffered.\\
446 - I'm sorry. I-I should have told you\\
447 - right from the beginning, but I couldn't.\\
448 - Let me tell you something.\\
449 - You are the only boss I've ever had in my life\\
450 - that I actually liked, and what's weird is,\\
451 - you're the only one I've ever lied to.\\
452 - I just couldn't stand the thought of hurting you.\\
453 - Thank you for telling me the truth.\\
454 - If you want to fire me, feel free.\\
455 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
456 - It was an accident.\\
457 - I think we should try to put it all behind us.\\
458 - I don't deserve a boss like you.\\
459 - Let us go home.\\
460 - Oh, Francis,\\
461 - there is an expression that you used\\
462 - that I am unfamiliar with.\\
463 - What does it mean when you say "fed her to you"?\\
464 - Okay.\\
465 - So, on the night I lost my virginity,\\
466 - I learned something very important\\
467 - about relationships and trust.\\
468 - Your body can be telling you to do something...\\
469 - I hope you all appreciate\\
470 - what those men were doing for you.\\
471 - And you might be happy to hear that in part\\
472 - because of the fine work Samuel's done with this program,\\
473 - he's getting paroled next week.\\
474 - Hey, I don't care if you get out!\\
475 - You'll never figure out how to find me.\\
476 - Jackass.\\
477 - And people, they hop from one person to another\\
478 - trying to get some sense of validation.\\
479 - They do this all through college,\\
480 - all through their twenties,\\
481 - having all sorts of casual encounters.\\
482 - And sometimes they even convince themselves\\
483 - that the relationship is serious\\
484 - because the sex is so great, but that...\\
485 - Wait. Stop.\\
486 - What did you mean by validation?\\
487 - Validating what?\\
488 - Well, sometimes people will attract other people\\
489 - just to prove to themselves that they're likable.\\
490 - And if that's the reason that you're having sex with someone,\\
491 - you can cause a lot of damage.\\
492 - But if you want to have sex with someone,\\
493 - doesn't that mean you really like them?\\
494 - Oh, no, honey.\\
495 - That's exactly the trap people fall into.\\
496 - You see, a lot of people...\\
497 - That was cool.\\
498 - How comes he doesn't dance as fast as you?\\
499 - I'm sorry.\\
500 - I'm sorry I said anything before.\\
501 - Mm-hmm!\\
502 - This is our shot!\\
503 - We can't blow it like this.\\
504 - The whole point of the Gentlemen Callers\\
505 - was to have fun and help Malik tone down his drinking.\\
506 - We're friends!\\
507 - I don't even know why we're fighting.\\
508 - Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce an act\\
509 - we haven't seen before at the Founders Dinner.\\
510 - Simmer down.\\
511 - Now let's give a warm welcome\\
512 - to the Gentlemen Callers!\\
513 - Well, I for one,  am a Gentleman Caller.\\
514 - Uh, well, th-thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\\
515 - The six of us couldn't be more honored to be here,\\
516 - and we're going to sing a little song about brotherhood.\\
517 - And forgiveness.\\
518 - And friendship.\\
519 - Whoo-hoo!\\
520 -     Play that banjo, Steve-o    \\
521 -     Yeehaw!    \\
522 -     Now all night long Charlie rides through the station    \\
523 -     Crying, "What will become of me?    \\
524 -     How can I afford to see    \\
525 -     My sister in Chelsea?    \\
526 -     Or my cousin in Roxbury    \\
527 -     But did he ever return?    \\
528 -     No, he never returned    \\
529 -     And his fate is still unlearned    \\
530 -      Fame and scandal     \\
531 -     He will ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston    \\
532 -     He's the man who never returned    \\
533 -     He's the man who never returned.    \\
534 - They loved us!\\
535 - We got more applause that the Whistling Whittlers!\\
536 - Yeah.\\
537 - Now everyone over to my house for pizza!\\
538 - How come you always go to his house?\\
539 - Sometimes after a fight,\\
540 - you feel closer than you feel when you're getting along.\\
541 - Can I ask you something else?\\
542 - Sure.\\
543 - Well, sometimes when I'm with Nicki, I have this feeling\\
544 - that she wants to be doing something else,\\
545 - but I don't know what it is.\\
546 - Then I try to guess.\\
547 - Oh, that's never good. Yeah, suddenly it's like\\
548 - I did something wrong, but I was just trying to help.\\
549 - I mean, what am I supposed to do? Just sit there...
\subsection {Episode 12: Kicked Out}
1 - Here we go! Yes!\\
2 - I win! I win!\\
3 - I finally beat you in a video game.\\
4 - In your face, Malcolm. In your face.\\
5 - Dad, Dad... Yes!\\
6 - The goal of Video Golf is to get the  fewest  points.\\
7 - Oh...\\
8 - Nice game.\\
9 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
10 -     I don't know    \\
11 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     Life is unfair.    \\
21 - - Give it! - No way.\\
22 - Okay, I'm going to do a load of colors,\\
23 - then a load of whites,\\
24 - so if you have any clothes in your room you want...\\
25 - Craig's been over here every day helping out with the chores\\
26 - since Mom went to her sister's.\\
27 - It was two weeks before we figured out nobody asked him.\\
28 - So Dad's in charge.\\
29 - Ow!\\
30 - Boys, quit horsing around and eat your dinner.\\
31 - Ah!\\
32 - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!\\
33 - Stop it! Stop!\\
34 - Now we are at zero tolerance now!\\
35 - Do you hear me? Zero tolerance!\\
36 - You boys have got\\
37 - to learn to behave!\\
38 - From now on...\\
39 - Who wants more mac and cheese?\\
40 - All right. Move it. Yeah. Me first.\\
41 - That is it!\\
42 - Sit down!\\
43 - Just because your mother isn't here\\
44 - is no excuse to misbehave.\\
45 - Now when I say zero tolerance,\\
46 - I mean  zero  tolerance.\\
47 - Tolerance\\
48 - to the zero degree.\\
49 - I'm talking zip, nada, zilch.\\
50 - In terms of tolerance.\\
51 - I'll get it.\\
52 - Malcolm... Hello.\\
53 - We are having a discussion.\\
54 - It's Stevie, he needs help\\
55 - with his math homework.\\
56 - Go.\\
57 - So if your want to derive wave maps in two space dimensions,\\
58 - you have to make sure\\
59 - you're talking about equivariant wave maps or else...\\
60 - You can't keep calling me here.\\
61 - I was guessing that you'd get to the phone first.\\
62 - Nicki, if my parents figure out we're still going out,\\
63 - I'll get totally nailed.\\
64 - Then we'll never get to see each other.\\
65 - I know it's hard, but we have to be more careful.\\
66 - Well, I'm bored, and my dad's gone for a while.\\
67 - I'll be right over.\\
68 - Okay, that is it!\\
69 - We are at zero tolerance now.\\
70 - Zero tolerance!\\
71 -     That's the night that the lights went out    \\
72 -     In Georgia    \\
73 -     That's the night that they hung an innocent man    \\
74 -     Well, don't trust your soul    \\
75 -     To no backwoods Southern lawyer    \\
76 -     'Cause the judge in the town's    \\
77 -     Got bloodstains on his hands    \\
78 -     Bloody, bloody hands.    \\
79 - Yeah!\\
80 - Fantastic.\\
81 - Once again you two have blown off my socks.\\
82 - Francis, meet my nephew,\\
83 - Willy.\\
84 - He doesn't speak English.\\
85 - Hello.\\
86 - Willy will be\\
87 - staying with us until\\
88 - his work visa gets straightened out.\\
89 - Until then\\
90 - we will get to hear\\
91 - his wonderful playing every day, no?\\
92 - Otto, let's get our sheet music.\\
93 - We can do our duet of\\
94 - "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."\\
95 - Ja.  It is not so much a song\\
96 - as it is a lovers' conversation.\\
97 - Come.\\
98 - So...\\
99 - how do you like America?\\
100 - Well... nice to meet you.\\
101 - It's so weird at my house.\\
102 - Nobody ever answers the phone.\\
103 - My brothers are seeing who can go the longest\\
104 - without changing their underwear.\\
105 - I never thought I'd miss my mom.\\
106 - I still don't, but I'm getting close.\\
107 - Well, it sounds like a drag,\\
108 - but at least it's going to be over in a month or two.\\
109 - Oh, by the way, did I tell you that my dad's\\
110 - going to bring Trish to my birthday party?\\
111 - Who's Trish?\\
112 - Trish-- the woman that my dad has been seeing\\
113 - for the past four months who totally hates me.\\
114 - Malcolm, I told you about her.\\
115 - Did I tell you my dad has taken away all my CDs?\\
116 - He says it's because I play them too loud,\\
117 - but I'm pretty sure I heard him\\
118 - listening to them in the garage.\\
119 - Malcolm, do you think for, like, once,\\
120 - we could talk about my problems?\\
121 - Oh. Okay, sure.\\
122 - Well, what are they?\\
123 - What are they?\\
124 - I've been sitting here...\\
125 - Nicki?\\
126 - Were you talking to someone?\\
127 - Yeah, it's my secret boyfriend.\\
128 - He's hiding under the bed.\\
129 - Don't you want to check?\\
130 - Why does everything have to be a snotty remark with you?\\
131 - Well, according to Trish, it's the "normal reaction"\\
132 - for not being the only girl in my daddy's life anymore.\\
133 - Come on, Nicki, she was being nice.\\
134 - Well, it's none of her business how I feel about anything.\\
135 - She's not my mom.\\
136 - Nobody said anything\\
137 - about her being your mom.\\
138 - Maybe it's time we talked this out.\\
139 - Okay, what do you want to talk about?\\
140 - How much Trish hates me?\\
141 - You're not going to pick a fight to get out of this.\\
142 - We're going to hash this out if we have to sit here\\
143 - all night.\\
144 - Boys...\\
145 - Boys, come on, let's be reasonable.\\
146 - This is no way to treat your father.\\
147 - What kind of father are you?\\
148 - You're nothing but a joke, and you're weak.\\
149 - Oh, man, are you going to pay for that\\
150 - when your mother gets home!\\
151 - You still think Mom's coming back\\
152 - after the way you screwed things up?\\
153 - Dewey, what do you think\\
154 - you're doing?\\
155 - I'm lighting Dad on fire.\\
156 - No way. I get to do it.\\
157 - We'll all do it.\\
158 - Oh, my God, honey.\\
159 - I just had the worst dream.\\
160 - The boys just... I-I lost control of them,\\
161 - and-and you were never coming home and...\\
162 - It was just awful.\\
163 - It's okay, sweetie.\\
164 - Go back to sleep.\\
165 - We'll spoon, okay?\\
166 - Okay.\\
167 - How come she's allowed to be naked\\
168 - on the kitchen table, and I'm not?\\
169 - Dewey, if a cop\\
170 - tells you to do something, you do it.\\
171 - What are you boys doing?\\
172 - I told you to go to bed hours ago.\\
173 - Actually, Dad, your exact words were just, "Go to bed."\\
174 - You didn't say, "Go to bed  now."\\
175 - If you leave us a loophole like that,\\
176 - I don't see how this could be our fault.\\
177 - You have disrespected my authority for the last time!\\
178 - I'm at zero tolerance!\\
179 - I keep thinking that at some point I might be able to trust you boys\\
180 - to do as you're told, but I can't.\\
181 - Well, there are going to be some big changes around here.\\
182 - Very big changes.\\
183 - Now get to bed!\\
184 - Uh, wait.\\
185 - Um...\\
186 - could you repeat that?\\
187 - My mind kind of wandered toward the end.\\
188 - Don't push it, Reese. You know very well what I...\\
189 - Hi, Dad.\\
190 - What are you...?\\
191 - Have you been out all night?\\
192 - Trust me, it wasn't my idea to be out this late.\\
193 - I suppose you were being held prisoner somewhere.\\
194 - I got home as quickly as I could.\\
195 - And besides,\\
196 - what are Reese and Dewey still doing up?\\
197 - Don't change the subject.\\
198 - You crossed the line, mister.\\
199 - And until further notice, there will be no TV, no computer\\
200 - and no video games because I am at zero tolerance with you boys!\\
201 - Is that understood?!\\
202 - Zero tolerance!\\
203 - What? Did you just roll your eyes at me?\\
204 - As long as you are living in this house,\\
205 - I demand your respect!\\
206 - For what?\\
207 - This house is a pigsty.\\
208 - Everything in the fridge\\
209 - has expired.\\
210 - I found a piece of cake in the shower.\\
211 - That's mine.\\
212 - And now you're screaming at me because you can't control them,\\
213 - and you know what?\\
214 - I'm sick of it. Oh, well, if that's\\
215 - the way you feel, you know where the door is.\\
216 - I do know where the door is, and I know how to use it!\\
217 - It's 3:00 in the morning.\\
218 - Everyone's a little upset...\\
219 - Then go ahead\\
220 - and use it! See if I care!\\
221 - Just turn the knob\\
222 - and pull.\\
223 - Oh, I'll turn the knob and pull.\\
224 - Just watch me!\\
225 - Turning and pulling!\\
226 - I'm watching, but I don't see you doing it.\\
227 - I  am  doing it.\\
228 - Turn. Pull.\\
229 - And now I'm outside!\\
230 - Congratulations!\\
231 - Would you like me to close the door?\\
232 - Yes, close the damn door!\\
233 - Thank you!\\
234 - Here comes the tearful apology.\\
235 - Three... two... one.\\
236 - So exactly how many militias is your dad in?\\
237 - These are all of his Armageddon supplies\\
238 - for when the U.N. takes over the banks.\\
239 - Anyways, thanks for hiding me.\\
240 - I don't know where else I could've gone\\
241 - without somebody's parents turning me in.\\
242 - Well, I'm gonna get some sleep. I'll bring you a snack\\
243 - in the morning.\\
244 - You know,\\
245 - this is actually going to be pretty cool,\\
246 - having you hiding up here right over my bedroom.\\
247 - You're like my little secret.\\
248 - Help yourself\\
249 - to some snacks.\\
250 - Just be careful of the trip wire.\\
251 - There's darts tipped with...\\
252 - Just be careful of the trip wire.\\
253 - You kicked him out of the house?\\
254 - Oh, please. He kicked himself out of the house, Craig.\\
255 - Look, I've been through this before with Reese and Francis.\\
256 - It never lasts long.\\
257 - When Reese was kicked out, he spent the night on the roof\\
258 - until he got into a fight with a pack of cats.\\
259 - So that makes it okay that Malcolm spent the night\\
260 - sleeping on a booze- soaked mattress\\
261 - in some dark alley? Craig...\\
262 - Oh, my God! He's probably dead by now!\\
263 - Malcolm can take care of himself.\\
264 - You're right, you're right. He's a genius, which would make him\\
265 - even more attractive to rogue elements in our secret weapons programs.\\
266 - How long before\\
267 - some government scientist picks him up\\
268 - and tries to surgically attach him to some animal?\\
269 - Stop playing.\\
270 - No more piano.\\
271 - No pi-a-no!\\
272 - Just stop playing!\\
273 - Ich verstehe nicht.\\
274 - You let me know\\
275 - if you hear anything at all.\\
276 - Oh, my God, he's been gone for over a day.\\
277 - Where the hell is he?!\\
278 - Keep it down!\\
279 - The neighbors don't have to know our business.\\
280 - How can you be smiling right now?\\
281 - Because I just realized-- we have a free pass.\\
282 - What do you mean?\\
283 - Can't you see how guilty Dad feels?\\
284 - He's not going to punish anybody else for a while.\\
285 - We're bulletproof.\\
286 - What are you going to do? I'm not sure yet.\\
287 - This is a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity.\\
288 - It's got to be perfect and huge.\\
289 - I want this to be a statement about everything I stand for.\\
290 - Okay, watch this.\\
291 - Okay, I don't know what happened...\\
292 - I know what happened.\\
293 - You have been riding those horses too much.\\
294 - We have an ointment, Francis.\\
295 - You put it on your  leistengegend,\\
296 - and it will be as good as new.\\
297 - It's good stuff, Francis.\\
298 - It's tingly.\\
299 - Ja. Come on.\\
300 - Excuse me. What?\\
301 - Uh, your poster, it's distracting people\\
302 - from my poster, and mine was there first.\\
303 - So? It's not your tree.\\
304 - Look, I-I'm sure that your dog-- Milton--\\
305 - is very sweet and you love him very much,\\
306 - but I'm looking for my son.\\
307 - An actual human being\\
308 - who's been missing for two days.\\
309 - Now don't you think finding a lost  person\\
310 - is more important than finding a lost dog?\\
311 - I don't know your kid,\\
312 - but from the way my mom and dad talk,\\
313 - your whole family isn't worth as much as my dog.\\
314 - You li...\\
315 - What's your name?\\
316 - Patrick. Patrick.\\
317 - Let me tell you\\
318 - a little something about your dog.\\
319 - He's gone, see?\\
320 - Some other family has taken him in.\\
321 - And right now that family\\
322 - is pampering Milton in ways you never even dreamed of.\\
323 - So your dog already loves them\\
324 - a lot more than he ever loved you.\\
325 - And if you ever did get him back,\\
326 - oh, he would just resent you\\
327 - until he found some way to escape again.\\
328 - So, why don't you just take the poster down, okay?\\
329 - Take your poster down.\\
330 - Your kid's probably in a crack house.\\
331 - Ha!\\
332 - Ha!\\
333 - Ha!\\
334 - Ha!\\
335 - Hey.\\
336 - I brought you some food.\\
337 - I can't believe I'm being forced to live in an attic,\\
338 - living off someone else's table scraps.\\
339 - Do you mind if I sit with you for a little bit?\\
340 - I'm really pissed at my dad right now.\\
341 - You're pissed at  your  dad?!\\
342 - Could you listen for a sec?\\
343 - My dad just told me that he's dragging me\\
344 - on some camping trip with him and Trish.\\
345 - I can't spend an entire weekend in a tent with that woman.\\
346 - He provoked the whole thing.\\
347 - He could've stopped me from walking out\\
348 - of the door if he'd really wanted to.\\
349 - Malcolm, I think it would be a really good idea\\
350 - if you would listen to me right now, do you understand?\\
351 - If you listen to what I'm saying,\\
352 - then you can give it some thought.\\
353 - And then we can talk it out\\
354 - in a way that's going to help me.\\
355 - And then I can do the same for you.\\
356 - Then we could have\\
357 - a conversation that actually matters.\\
358 - No! He had to act like a  big  man.\\
359 - What was he trying to prove?\\
360 - That's it.\\
361 - That's what?\\
362 - I can't take this anymore.\\
363 - You are the most selfish, thoughtless person\\
364 - that I have ever seen.\\
365 - From now on, I am not your girlfriend.\\
366 - You're breaking up with me?\\
367 - You have  killed\\
368 - everything I have ever felt for you. It's over!\\
369 - But, but what am I going to do?\\
370 - I never want to see you again!\\
371 - Just come home, Malcolm.\\
372 - If you want me to apologize, I will.\\
373 - I was wrong, and you\\
374 - were totally right about everything.\\
375 - Geez, Dad, hold something back.\\
376 - Who cares what started all this?\\
377 - It doesn't matter.\\
378 - I just want you back because you're my son.\\
379 - And you're the only one in this family who has a chance\\
380 - of amounting to anything. What?\\
381 - It's not true, son. I was just trying to...\\
382 - I'm just trying to get Malcolm home.\\
383 - Ignore that last part, Malcolm. You're our only hope.\\
384 - Please, come home. I love you.\\
385 - So my dad kicked me out of the house,\\
386 - then Nicki broke up with me.\\
387 - I don't know how long ago it was.\\
388 - I can't remember if these mean hours or days.\\
389 - That's Nicki.\\
390 - Did you hear that?\\
391 - That's her talking.\\
392 - What's she laughing about?\\
393 - She can't be laughing.\\
394 - She's not laughing, she's crying.\\
395 - Just like my dad.\\
396 - They're all suffering now.\\
397 - Okay, Willy, here goes.\\
398 - I know you are trying to be friendly, but...\\
399 - ...what your armchair are doing is make me feel bad.\\
400 - Crybaby bastard.\\
401 - No, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.\\
402 - I'm not going to get mad.\\
403 - Okay, Willy, you want it, you got it!\\
404 - Come on, Willy!\\
405 - Make some music to this!\\
406 - Where's your music now, Willy?!\\
407 - Where's your music now?!\\
408 - He was... playing music...\\
409 - while I...\\
410 - did stuff.\\
411 - Okay, maybe Nicki could have at least left me a paper cup\\
412 - or something up here.\\
413 - I just wish she'd come back to say hello.\\
414 - I miss talking to her.\\
415 - I was going to be her little secret.\\
416 - She's so incredible.\\
417 - I can't believe she ever liked me.\\
418 - I had Nicki and I had a family.\\
419 - What happened?\\
420 - How did it ever get like this?\\
421 - My God, I'm horrible.\\
422 - No wonder my dad kicked me out of the house.\\
423 - I'm annoying and selfish.\\
424 - Nicki and my family are lucky.\\
425 - At least they get to get away from me.\\
426 - I'm stuck here with myself.\\
427 - Wait a second.\\
428 - I don't have to be like this.\\
429 - I can change.\\
430 - I can totally change.\\
431 - From now on, I'll just listen to what people say.\\
432 - I'll be friendly.\\
433 - I'll be considerate.\\
434 - Yeah.\\
435 - Yeah, I like this new Malcolm.\\
436 - That's her.\\
437 - What's she talking about?\\
438 - That's a guy's voice.\\
439 - There's a guy in her room.\\
440 - A guy in her room!\\
441 - I am telling you\\
442 - he is not here!\\
443 - This moment has been\\
444 - a long time coming.\\
445 - The fruit of over two hours of planning and labor.\\
446 - Thank you.\\
447 - Try as I might, I just can't find a flaw in this plan.\\
448 - Behold!\\
449 - Turn it off! Turn it off!\\
450 - Stop it!\\
451 - Dewey, aah!\\
452 - Dewey!\\
453 - Guys, come back!\\
454 - For the love of God, help me!\\
455 - Stop it!\\
456 - Reese,\\
457 - what are you doing?\\
458 - Whoa...\\
459 - Help!\\
460 - Oh, why me?\\
461 - Welcome home, son.\\
462 - Thanks, Dad.\\
463 - Help me!\\
464 - If it helps, this probably would have happened\\
465 - even if Mom  was  here.\\
466 - Someone, please! It does help.\\
467 - I have to go to the bathroom.
\subsection {Episode 13: Stereo Store}
1 - Ah, shoot.\\
2 - I was going to go outside this weekend.\\
3 - Maybe the weather's better on channel seven.\\
4 - Hey, Alison.\\
5 - Okay, here's your book report.\\
6 - It's a guaranteed "A."\\
7 - Thank you.\\
8 - Oh, I totally forgot to do mine.\\
9 - And I can't afford to get another "F."\\
10 - No problem.\\
11 - Now we'll both get "C's."\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Malcolm! Briefcase!\\
25 - Dewey! Work pants! Ready.\\
26 - Reese! Vest!\\
27 - Mom's baby doctor won't let her come home for a few weeks,\\
28 - and since she's not working, Dad had to get a second job.\\
29 - It's really crazy.\\
30 - But mostly, it's just funny.\\
31 - I have hired a new baby-sitter for you boys.\\
32 - She should be here any minute.\\
33 - What?! What do we need a baby-sitter for?\\
34 - Because I want to house to be where I left it.\\
35 - There she is.\\
36 - Jessica? Hi.\\
37 - Hi, Reese. Hi, Malcolm.\\
38 - You know each other?\\
39 - She's in my class, Dad.\\
40 - She's a year younger than me.\\
41 - I'll be darned.\\
42 - No way is she baby-sitting.\\
43 - She's younger than me.\\
44 - She's older than me.\\
45 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
46 - Look, kids, I'm sorry for the mix-up,\\
47 - but today is my first day, and I can't be late.\\
48 - So we're just going to have to pull together\\
49 - and make the best of it.\\
50 - It's going to be a little embarrassing,\\
51 - I'll grant you that,\\
52 - but ten years from now you'll look back and laugh.\\
53 - In college, I had a poli-sci teacher who was\\
54 - worst dresser in the world.\\
55 - Why, he was always taking so much time to get ready...\\
56 - Wow, this is weird.\\
57 - So, you go set the table, and you two wash up for dinner.\\
58 - Okay.\\
59 - Excuse me. This is so exciting.\\
60 - Oh, look, a light.\\
61 - And-and what are these marvelous things?\\
62 - C clamps. The C clamp!\\
63 - Oh, Otto, it's like a dream.\\
64 - Oh, Francis, what a brilliant idea,\\
65 - opening our doors to the film industry.\\
66 - It was no big deal.\\
67 - When Patrick said he wanted to direct a movie here,\\
68 - all I said was, "Sure."\\
69 - It's not like it's a big budget movie or anything.\\
70 - Don't belittle yourself, Francis.\\
71 - They will tell their friends at the Brown Derby.\\
72 - Soon, bigger movies will come.\\
73 - And one day I will be fluffing the pillow\\
74 - of Mr. Rutger Hauer.\\
75 - Excuse me.\\
76 - Are you an actress? Guilty.\\
77 - I knew it. I've seen you in something.\\
78 - I know I have. What was it?\\
79 - Dirty Girls Down Under.\\
80 - Yes!\\
81 - No.\\
82 - That's the one I always get.\\
83 - I won a Bootie Award for the Best Girl-On-Girl scene.\\
84 - This is it?\\
85 - No!\\
86 - Oh, Otto!\\
87 - No.\\
88 - No, no, no,  no.\\
89 - All right, listen up.\\
90 - I want you guys to meet Hal.\\
91 - Hi. Hey.\\
92 - Hi, guys.\\
93 - These are the idiots.\\
94 - They're totally useless.\\
95 - I'm serious. Whatever they do,\\
96 - you do the opposite.\\
97 - I don't know what that was about,\\
98 - but I'm looking forward to working with you guys.\\
99 - I'm sure you can teach me a lot.\\
100 - Can you help me?\\
101 - Oh, sure, ma'am.\\
102 - Is this a clock radio or just a radio?\\
103 - Oh, uh, uh, it's a clock radio.\\
104 - It's also a CD player.\\
105 - Oh, thank you.\\
106 - You're welcome.\\
107 - Did you see that?\\
108 - Did either of you idiots see that?\\
109 - This guy's been on the job two minutes, already he's done\\
110 - more than the two of you jackasses put together.\\
111 - I-I just read the sign.\\
112 - Either of you chowder heads ever bother to read a sign?\\
113 - No, unlike you shiftless losers,\\
114 - this is a man who's going to get me\\
115 - out of the hellhole of assistant night manager!\\
116 - Thank you.\\
117 - So you guys have a softball team?\\
118 - I don't understand what relative density is.\\
119 - It's the weight of an object compared to the weight\\
120 - of an equal volume of water.\\
121 - Oh, neat.\\
122 - Reese, you have the next bath after Dewey.\\
123 - Two more minutes, Dewey.\\
124 - Okay.\\
125 - You can't make me take a bath.\\
126 - I'll go outside and roll in the mud,\\
127 - and I'll go to bed that way.\\
128 - Come on, be a big boy.\\
129 - I'll take the tugboat, and you can have the ducky.\\
130 - You think this is funny?\\
131 - It's kind of funny.\\
132 - Reese, I'll make you a deal.\\
133 - Help me with the dishes, and I won't make you take a bath.\\
134 - You can't make me do anything!\\
135 - Boy, Alison was right about your temper.\\
136 - What are you talking about?\\
137 - Oh, she was kind of saying that you were...\\
138 - You know what? Never mind.\\
139 - Is she mad at me?\\
140 - I wouldn't say mad.\\
141 - What'd she say?\\
142 - I probably shouldn't.\\
143 - No, no, no, you have to.\\
144 - Give me that.\\
145 - Well, it wasn't really what  she said.\\
146 - It was more the  way  she said it.\\
147 - Oh, that's baked on. You'll need some cleanser for that.\\
148 - Oh, okay.\\
149 - Go on.\\
150 - Okay, Reese is easy, but she's good.\\
151 - Otto... Ooh, Francis.\\
152 - There's a problem with this film.\\
153 - We heard about the actors that didn't show up,\\
154 - but don't worry.\\
155 - They gave the part to Gretchen.\\
156 - What?! No!\\
157 - It's not a big part.\\
158 - I just walk in  und  say,\\
159 - "Looks like we're going to need more towels."\\
160 - Und  then I walk out.\\
161 - Do you have any idea what kind of a movie this is?\\
162 - So it's an independent film.\\
163 - If the Sundance Film Festival has taught us anything,\\
164 - it is that the low budget film can compete with the big boys.\\
165 - But this... It doesn't matter\\
166 - what kind of movie it is.\\
167 - It makes me feel so-so good, you know?\\
168 - I guess, like any little girl,\\
169 - I had dreams,  ja,\\
170 - but they said I wasn't pretty enough,\\
171 - and they said I wasn't smart enough.\\
172 - Your mother was a jealous cow.\\
173 - Thank you, Francis.\\
174 - I owe it all to you.\\
175 - Dad doesn't have time to find us a new baby-sitter,\\
176 - so we're stuck with Jessica, which is fine with me.\\
177 - I don't plan on spending any time here anyway.\\
178 - Dewey, what are you eating?\\
179 - Carrot sticks.\\
180 - Jessica says we have to eat healthier.\\
181 - I don't what company makes this stuff, but I hate it.\\
182 - Reese? Don't step on the floor.\\
183 - Jessica said if I scrubbed the floor,\\
184 - she'd tell me how far Alison's willing to go with me.\\
185 - Oh, hi, Malcolm.\\
186 - Listen, I need you to make a salad and set the table.\\
187 - Oh, that's interesting.\\
188 - I need you to do it yourself\\
189 - because I'm going to a movie.\\
190 - On a school night?\\
191 - You really think Hal would want you to?\\
192 - Well, he's not here,\\
193 - so if I want to go to a movie, I'll go to a movie.\\
194 - You know, Malcolm, I think Hal looks to you...\\
195 - Stop calling him Hal.\\
196 - Look, don't think you can control me\\
197 - the way you can these two.\\
198 - What are you talking about?\\
199 - I'm not saying you don't have some skills.\\
200 - They're just wasted on me.\\
201 - I'm smarter than you.\\
202 - Smarter how?\\
203 - My brain just works differently, okay?\\
204 - I can see what you're doing and what you're planning at the same time.\\
205 - So what, you have, like, two brains?\\
206 - Of course not!\\
207 - Nobody has two brains.\\
208 - Look, do you know how multitasking works\\
209 - on a computer?\\
210 - Here, I'll draw you a diagram.\\
211 - Let's say this circle is your conscious mind\\
212 - during a normal conversation.\\
213 - This intersecting circle represents another track.\\
214 - Not opposed to the first...\\
215 - Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.\\
216 - For lack of a better term, we'll call this track subtext.\\
217 - Now, with my brain,\\
218 - there can be four tracks going at one time,\\
219 - plus one supervisor track that keeps them all in line,\\
220 - unless you're talking about...\\
221 - Hey, guys.\\
222 - So, when you're not at work, what do you do for fun?\\
223 - Nothing.\\
224 - Yeah, me, too. Word.\\
225 - I hold in my hand two tickets to Ozzfest.\\
226 - They go to our tops salesman of the month.\\
227 - Hal!\\
228 - What? Oh, man.\\
229 - You guys are pathetic.\\
230 - He beat you in one day.\\
231 - I just got lucky.\\
232 - Hey, you know what? I really can't use these.\\
233 - If you guys want to go... Oh, no,\\
234 - I gave those tickets to you.\\
235 - They're nontransferable.\\
236 - We can't reward these idiots\\
237 - for standing around doing nothing!\\
238 - Randy, let me...\\
239 - Randy, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job,\\
240 - but sometimes a little...\\
241 - Are-are-are they doing that at me?\\
242 - You know what that sound is?\\
243 - That's the sound of success.\\
244 - And sometimes my thoughts are,\\
245 - like, three-dimensional.\\
246 - I can almost reach out and touch them.\\
247 - Or they could just be pure logic, like...\\
248 - Malcolm, it's getting late.\\
249 - Is it?\\
250 - Oh, man, the movie was over an hour ago.\\
251 - Huh.\\
252 - Well, anyway, I'm glad to know\\
253 - how much smarter you are than me.\\
254 - Okay, Jessica has taken over the house,\\
255 - and we need to get it back.\\
256 - She can't get away with this.\\
257 - Once she finishes laying out our clothes for tomorrow,\\
258 - she's dead meat.\\
259 - No more early bedtimes,\\
260 - and no more being a Clean Plate Ranger.\\
261 - Then we're agreed...\\
262 - it ends now.\\
263 - You know, I really  am  tired.\\
264 - Me, too. 8:00 is pretty late.\\
265 - And I'm really much better at making someone dead meat\\
266 - after I've had a good night's sleep.\\
267 - But tomorrow...\\
268 - She's going down.\\
269 - No question.\\
270 - Did everyone brush our teeth?\\
271 - Excuse me, Patrick?\\
272 - Can I talk to you about Gretchen?\\
273 - I love Gretchen.\\
274 - She's just like my mom,\\
275 - except she's not a 60-year-old stripper.\\
276 - Look, I didn't know when I booked your company\\
277 - that you made... porn.\\
278 - My problem is Gretchen\\
279 - really has her heart set on doing this, and...\\
280 - I don't want to call the police.\\
281 - Oh, I get it.\\
282 - So, what's your pleasure-- Debbie or Lance?\\
283 - No! No, that's not what I'm talking about.\\
284 - I just have a little rewrite.\\
285 - Rewrite?\\
286 - Let me explain something to you--\\
287 - these people are not actors.\\
288 - You can't just change the words on them at the last second.\\
289 - Just look it over. It's only a little different.\\
290 - Uh, Sicilian volcano, four letters.\\
291 - Etna.\\
292 - A-T...\\
293 - E-T-N-A.\\
294 - We haven't managed to get rid of Jessica yet,\\
295 - but we've been putting the screws to her pretty good.\\
296 - It's just a question of time.\\
297 - Your tea.\\
298 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
299 - Isn't he sweet?\\
300 - All right, boys, bedtime!\\
301 - No way!\\
302 - No, I want to stay up and do more sew...\\
303 - Oh, my God!\\
304 - Boys. They're overtired.\\
305 - Excuse me.\\
306 - All right. Get your butts in your bed right now,\\
307 - or I'll tell everyone you know...\\
308 - that you walk around in your mother's shoes.\\
309 - But that's a secret!\\
310 - And I'll tell Alison\\
311 - you spent an hour on the phone with Cindy Reid.\\
312 - Oh, now it's a crime to be a good listener?\\
313 - And a certain boy genius takes Pro-Gro Bodybuilding Supplement.\\
314 - I do not.\\
315 - "Bulk up now, watch the ladies say  wow."\\
316 - No one will believe you.\\
317 - Maybe not. We'll just leave it to the tough,\\
318 - but always fair, court of high school public opinion.\\
319 - For the love of God,\\
320 - it's 7:30.\\
321 - We're supposed to be tougher than her.\\
322 - Well, Malcolm's supposed to be smarter than her.\\
323 - I  am  smarter than her.\\
324 - She just caught me off guard a couple of times.\\
325 - I'll come up with something.\\
326 - Something heinous, something brutal.\\
327 - Dewey, get your footy pajamas.\\
328 - I'm not wearing those.\\
329 - Do you want to spend the rest of your life\\
330 - trying to remember what chocolate tastes like?\\
331 - And take Professor Cuddles.\\
332 - Dewey, what are you doing up?\\
333 - I'm trying to be a big boy, but... I miss my mommy.\\
334 - Aww...\\
335 - Come here, honey.\\
336 - Awww...\\
337 - Okay, he's asleep.\\
338 - Whose turn was it?\\
339 - Yours. Truth or dare?\\
340 - Truth.\\
341 - What is your deepest, darkest secret?\\
342 - Well...\\
343 - Attention shoppers: the store is now closed.\\
344 - Please bring your purchases...\\
345 - I mean, don't I seem likable to  you?\\
346 - I don't seem like a suck-up, do I?\\
347 - Throughout our conversation here, I haven't used\\
348 - any unnecessary compliments, have I?\\
349 - I just want a toaster.\\
350 - I haven't once said\\
351 - that you have a square jaw or a beautiful voice.\\
352 - Even if I think so,\\
353 - I didn't say it.\\
354 - Hang on a second.\\
355 - Hey... hey, guys. Guys!\\
356 - Hey, hey, you want to go get a beer?\\
357 - I'm buying.\\
358 - We kind of have plans.\\
359 - Oh. Where you going?\\
360 - Party. I mean, nowhere.\\
361 - Nowhere  interesting.\\
362 - You know, just some other guys...\\
363 - From work.\\
364 - Hey! Well, I'm a guy from work.\\
365 - Uh, why don't I follow you there?\\
366 - That sounds like a lot of fun.\\
367 - Yeah, okay.\\
368 - Way to go.\\
369 - Randy, I-I know you asked me to help you close up,\\
370 - but I'm feeling a little bit ill.\\
371 - You want to go to that party.\\
372 - No, no, I...\\
373 - Hal, look, I don't know why you care\\
374 - what those guys think,\\
375 - but I'm going to protect you from yourself.\\
376 - I'm really not feeling well.\\
377 - Hal, you need to make a choice.\\
378 - Do you really want to jeopardize your job\\
379 - just to make friends\\
380 - with a bunch of brain-dead idiots?\\
381 - Guys!\\
382 - Wait up!\\
383 - I won't let you do it, Hal!\\
384 - I can't believe they're letting us watch them film.\\
385 - Okay, and uh...\\
386 - action!\\
387 - Room service.\\
388 - Mmm, I really need some service.\\
389 - Where do you want me to...\\
390 - put it?\\
391 - Anywhere you want to... put it.\\
392 - Well, I want to put it here.\\
393 - Oh, yeah. Yeah.\\
394 - And...\\
395 - here.\\
396 - Yeah, that's even  better.\\
397 - Mmm. Yeah.\\
398 - Can anyone join in?!\\
399 - Yeah.\\
400 - That's it.\\
401 - You're the best.\\
402 - Looks like we're going to need more towels!\\
403 - And cut.\\
404 - Bravo!\\
405 - Can we get back to work now?\\
406 - I'm shooting my sister's wedding in six hours.\\
407 - Sure. Thank you.\\
408 - The cinema\\
409 - has a brilliant new light,\\
410 - and her name is Gretchen Mannkusser.\\
411 - Oh, Otto!\\
412 - You were great.\\
413 - Really? I don't know.\\
414 - I found that whole scene was kind of stupid\\
415 - and pointless.\\
416 - You know what would have helped?\\
417 - Some sex.\\
418 - Ja, ja, ja.\\
419 - But you know these Americans--\\
420 - they have lots of hang-ups, eh?\\
421 - Night.\\
422 - Oh, come back tomorrow.\\
423 - I'll have the boys make stroganoff.\\
424 - Dewey, I thought you were asleep.\\
425 - You thought a lot of things.\\
426 - What are you boys doing dressed?\\
427 - You want to handle this?\\
428 - Oh, yeah.\\
429 - Where are you going?\\
430 - Come back here!\\
431 - I'm calling Alison!\\
432 - Are you going to tell her you said she was stupid,\\
433 - and you're only friends with her to borrow her clothes?\\
434 - Why, you little...\\
435 - Or would you rather call your parents\\
436 - and tell them you're  the one\\
437 - who stole your grandmother's ring?\\
438 - Okay, here's how it's going to work:\\
439 - Reese and I are going out,\\
440 - and you're gonna tell my dad\\
441 - we were here the whole time.\\
442 - You're gonna stay here with Dewey,\\
443 - and wait on him hand and foot.\\
444 - I want a sundae and then some pizza.\\
445 - And then another pizza and then a pizza sundae.\\
446 - Let's face it-- you had this coming.\\
447 - If I were you, I'd learn something from this.\\
448 - You have to realize when you're over-matched.\\
449 - What are you doing?\\
450 - Just get out of here.\\
451 - Hey, you're the one who...\\
452 - Look, don't cry.\\
453 - I can do whatever I want. I'm horrible.\\
454 - Everybody hates me.\\
455 - No, they don't.\\
456 - Well, they should.\\
457 - I don't know why I'm like this. I just...\\
458 - It's okay... it's okay.\\
459 - Hey, guys.\\
460 - Sure beats the hell\\
461 - out of working, am I right?\\
462 - Don't you have a family?\\
463 - Hey! Who's up for a Tijuana carwash, huh?\\
464 - Right here. Yeah, me, too, me, too!\\
465 - I am totally up for a Tijuana car wash.\\
466 - Dude, have you ever  done a Tijuana car wash?\\
467 - Have I ever done a Tijuana carwash?\\
468 - Okay, him first.\\
469 - Car wash, car wash!\\
470 - Yeah! Yeah!\\
471 - That was awesome, man!\\
472 - Whoo, that was hilarious!\\
473 - That was hilarious.\\
474 - I can't believe you did that.\\
475 - Well, you know... party guy... me.\\
476 - Can I get you a beer?\\
477 - I'm good.\\
478 - Everyone get out of here!\\
479 - My parents are back from Maui!\\
480 - Did they see you?\\
481 - I don't think so.\\
482 - What am I doing?\\
483 - What the hell am I doing?\\
484 - There's no reason for me to be here.\\
485 - You're an  idiot.\\
486 - Your friends are idiots.\\
487 - Everyone jammed into this playhouse is an idiot.\\
488 - You just called yourself an idiot.\\
489 - I think I'm going to be sick.\\
490 - I know you guys.\\
491 - I used to  be  one of you before my family.\\
492 - Now thanks to them, I know what's really important,\\
493 - and it's not what you  think of me,\\
494 - it's what  they  think of me.\\
495 - Thank God for my wife.\\
496 - Thank God for my kids.\\
497 - You're welcome.\\
498 - Reese?\\
499 - Can I get a ride home with you?\\
500 - I used to think I was so smart.\\
501 - But I'm just selfish.\\
502 - Here.\\
503 - Drink this.\\
504 - Thank you.\\
505 - I'll tell you one thing--\\
506 - you made me take a good, hard look at myself,\\
507 - and I don't like what I see.\\
508 - Look, you're not a bad person.\\
509 - I didn't mean to put you through this.\\
510 - - I was just trying to... - We're back!\\
511 - Dad, Reese, what are you...?\\
512 - What time is it?\\
513 - Listen, Jessica, you've been a big help,\\
514 - but tonight's going to be your last night.\\
515 - I don't have that job anymore-- sorry.\\
516 - It's okay.\\
517 - It was a lot of fun.\\
518 - They're good kids.\\
519 - Bye.\\
520 - Wh... All right,\\
521 - the two of you-- get to bed.\\
522 - Dude, you missed an awesome party.\\
523 - Wait, she didn't...\\
524 - I'm smarter than...\\
525 - She...\\
526 - Okay, I'm just going to call it a tie and go to bed.
\subsection {Episode 14: Hal's Friend}
1 - Boys... you see what I have?\\
2 - This is a movie I asked you to return three weeks ago.\\
3 - What if we want to watch it again?\\
4 - I found it in the dishwasher.\\
5 - 21 days times $2.99 a day, that's...\\
6 - $62.79. What?!\\
7 - What is it going to take for you boys\\
8 - to learn some responsibility?\\
9 - You can't just go through life letting things slide?\\
10 - Sooner or later, you are going to learn that...\\
11 - Is it the tenth already?\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Mom's been at her sister's for a month,\\
25 - resting while she's pregnant.\\
26 - Things were kind of chaotic for a while,\\
27 - but we've settled into a pretty nice rhythm.\\
28 - Can I use a glass?\\
29 - No.  Nothing that requires washing.\\
30 - Okay, let's clear the table.\\
31 - Oh, I talked to your mother last night.\\
32 - She misses you all very much, and she'll be home soon.\\
33 - How soon?\\
34 - A few weeks.\\
35 - Oh, and Reese, she wanted you\\
36 - to sweep the leaves off the garage roof\\
37 - when you get home from school today.\\
38 - What? But today is the one day\\
39 - that Alison's parents aren't home.\\
40 - To interfere with our homework.\\
41 - Reese, your mother... This isn't fair!\\
42 - Mom can't control us when she's not even here!\\
43 - Nobody is being controlled by your mother.\\
44 - For instance, I'm inviting an old friend over tonight,\\
45 - and even though we're never going to tell\\
46 - your mother about it, it doesn't mean we're being controlled.\\
47 - To repeat: Your mother is never to hear about this.\\
48 - And you boys are just going to love Larry.\\
49 - We were inseparable in high school.\\
50 - But seriously, your mother cannot find out\\
51 - he was in this house.\\
52 - Dad, you're hurting me. Oh.\\
53 - Sorry, sweetheart.\\
54 - Malcolm... Stevie!\\
55 - Hi, Mrs. Hooper.\\
56 - Do either of you hooligans\\
57 - know where my son, Dabney, is?\\
58 - I don't know. He was excused from gym.\\
59 - What  is  a nervous eyelid anyway?\\
60 - It's an allergic reaction to either gluten, whey or air.\\
61 - I suppose you boys are coming\\
62 - to Dabney's birthday party tonight. Yeah.\\
63 - Sure. Just a little reminder:\\
64 - I don't want either of you\\
65 - showing up with any punk hairdos or racy outfits.\\
66 - What are you doing on the pavement, huh?\\
67 - I told you to walk on the grass.\\
68 - There's another guy\\
69 - who doesn't let me walk on the grass.\\
70 - Fine, you like the pavement so much, kiss it.\\
71 - Oh, my God... Dabney!\\
72 - You come away from there!\\
73 - Did you make\\
74 - eye contact with that big boy?\\
75 - When you're in danger,\\
76 - you tuck and cower.\\
77 - I was cowering; he wouldn't let me tuck.\\
78 -     I'm a little teapot, short and...    \\
79 - Ow!\\
80 -     Here is my handle    \\
81 -     Here is my...    \\
82 - Ow!\\
83 -     When I get all steamed up    \\
84 -     Hear me...     Ow!\\
85 -     Tip me over and    \\
86 -     Pour me...     Ow!\\
87 - Not it.\\
88 - Hello?\\
89 - Hello. This is a recorded greeting\\
90 - from the Malgacore Financial...\\
91 - Hi, Mom. We're fine.\\
92 - Okay, I'll ask him.\\
93 - Mom wants to know if you swept the leaves\\
94 - off the garage. I'm doing it now.\\
95 - So Piama called-- she and Gretchen got to Tucson okay.\\
96 - Tucson... the city that never sleeps.\\
97 - They think they're going to have so much fun\\
98 - but we will show them, eh?\\
99 - Just us guys.\\
100 - Where do you want your things, Otto?\\
101 - Just put them in Francis' room.\\
102 - What?\\
103 - Oh, and Gretchen left this for you. Wh...?\\
104 - Hold on. Why is he bringing your things to my room?\\
105 - Because I'm staying with you this weekend.\\
106 - I have not slept alone in a bed for 35 years.\\
107 - You're planning on sleeping in my bed? With me?\\
108 - It would be presumptuous of me to ask a guest.\\
109 - "Don't forget to sweep the leaves\\
110 - "off my roof 'cause I'm a mean old lady.\\
111 - "Who cares if it's wet and slippery?\\
112 - "The roof has to be cleaned\\
113 - 'cause I'm stupid."\\
114 - Not it.\\
115 - Hello?\\
116 - Oh, hi, Mom.\\
117 - I wasn't talking about her.\\
118 - What do you mean "Mom"?\\
119 - It's me, Francis. Did you page me?\\
120 - Yeah, Reese is right here.\\
121 - I'll tell him, Mom,\\
122 - but does he really have to stay up all night?\\
123 - Can't he fix\\
124 - my bike tomorrow?\\
125 - Well, you're right.\\
126 - Saturday morning is the best time for riding.\\
127 - Okay.\\
128 - Now I get it.\\
129 - Just go easy on him.\\
130 - You're a lot smarter than he is.\\
131 - I've got to go.\\
132 - Whoo!\\
133 - Whoo!\\
134 - This floor is so cold.\\
135 - Get me under those warm blankets.\\
136 - Aah...!\\
137 - Aah.\\
138 - Aah...\\
139 - This is sort of weird.\\
140 - I haven't had a sleep-over since I was in the third grade.\\
141 - I was at Jeffery Feldman's house and his mom, uh...\\
142 - Otto, what the hell are you doing?!\\
143 - I know, I am a notorious blanket hog.\\
144 - Mmm.\\
145 - Otto! Ooh. Sorry.\\
146 - Popsicle toes.\\
147 - Push! Push!\\
148 - Look! I'm starting to crown!\\
149 - Get this horrible thing out of me!\\
150 - Can he open presents now? Yeah, can I?\\
151 - Oh, okay, but go slow.\\
152 - We don't want to end up covered in paper cuts, do we?\\
153 - Boy, this is such a great party.\\
154 - It's twice the turnout we had\\
155 - last year.\\
156 - Can I open Grandpa's present\\
157 - first, Mom?\\
158 - Well, we might as well get that out of the way.\\
159 - Whoa.\\
160 - The XJ... 7000!\\
161 - Cool!\\
162 - What is it?\\
163 - It's a paintball gun.\\
164 - It's, like, the best one you can buy.\\
165 - I'll take that.\\
166 - But, Mom! When will your thoughtless grandfather learn?\\
167 - These gifts do nothing\\
168 - but overstimulate you.\\
169 - And when the so-called fun ends,\\
170 - you're left all red and giggly and up until 9:00.\\
171 - Well, not this time.\\
172 - Give it to Mommy.\\
173 - That's okay.\\
174 - I wouldn't know how to paint with it anyway.\\
175 - Why don't you open one of my gifts?\\
176 - A new hairbrush.\\
177 - Thanks, Mom.\\
178 - Want to give it a try?\\
179 - Sure.\\
180 - Count down from a hundred.\\
181 - You boys can help.\\
182 - One hundred...\\
183 - 99...\\
184 - 98...\\
185 - 97...\\
186 - Oh, ha, ha!\\
187 - Here he is!\\
188 - Hey, you big jackass!\\
189 - It was just Mrs. Haggerty turning around in our driveway.\\
190 - So how come Mom won't let you hang out with this Larry guy?\\
191 - Oh, she thinks he's a bad influence.\\
192 - You know Mom, she's always\\
193 - blowing things out of proportion.\\
194 - Just like at our wedding.\\
195 - Okay, he missed the ceremony,\\
196 - but he did show up with these two totally hot...\\
197 - Well, that's a bad example.\\
198 - Oh, there was this time in New Orleans when we...\\
199 - No, that's no good either.\\
200 - Oh! Here's on.\\
201 - Our families went to the same church...\\
202 - Oh... well, you know your mother.\\
203 - She just makes stuff up.\\
204 - He's here!\\
205 - Dewey!\\
206 - Hoo!\\
207 - Oh, ho!\\
208 - Pass complete! Larry!\\
209 - Hal!\\
210 - Man, you look like crap.\\
211 - You, too, buddy. Come on in.\\
212 - Boys, I'd like you to meet Larry Ross.\\
213 - These are my boys. This is Reese\\
214 - and Dewey. Malcolm is at\\
215 - a birthday party.\\
216 - So, you got custody, huh?\\
217 - Good for you.\\
218 - Little word to the wise, I heard, uh,\\
219 - you should talk nice about the ex, even if she is...\\
220 - No, no, no, no, no, I'm still married to Lois.\\
221 - Oh, really?\\
222 - Oh, yeah.\\
223 - Well, that's-that's great, man.\\
224 - That's-that's just great.\\
225 - You know, there's a little bar down the way that...\\
226 - No, no, she's out of town for a while.\\
227 - Sweet! First beer, 7:04.\\
228 - One of you kids ought to write that down.\\
229 - Isn't he great?\\
230 - This is kind of a landmark night for me.\\
231 - My first psychological trauma not caused by my mother.\\
232 - But I guess I do owe Otto for everything he's done for me.\\
233 - I mean, he and Gretchen have just been amazing.\\
234 - Gretchen....\\
235 - I wonder what was in that note?\\
236 - Whoa, whoa, whoa...\\
237 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...\\
238 - They had to take that tractor apart piece by piece\\
239 - to get it out of the teacher's lounge.\\
240 - But you never gave me up, man.\\
241 - What happened?\\
242 - I mean, look at me.\\
243 - Middle-aged, lousy job.\\
244 - Dumpy little house that can't hold the kids I have\\
245 - and another one on the way.\\
246 - Don't get down on yourself, man.\\
247 - The only reason you're a failure\\
248 - is because society hates free spirits like you and me.\\
249 - It's the price we pay\\
250 - for being in the vanguard.\\
251 - You remember the way Dawkins\\
252 - screwed us over?\\
253 - Who? Dawkins.\\
254 - Our boss back at Carmello's.\\
255 - You remember senior year, Labor Day weekend?\\
256 - The kitchen flooded.\\
257 - We spent the whole weekend cleaning it up,\\
258 - and then he stiffed us out of 200 bucks.\\
259 - Wait! Yeah!\\
260 - Unbelievable.\\
261 - 200 bucks. I mean, you take that,\\
262 - plus the interest over all these years,\\
263 - we're rolling in it.\\
264 - Boy, if I had that money right now,\\
265 - I could afford to build a nursery.\\
266 - Thanks a lot, Dawkins.\\
267 - You want a nursery, Hal?\\
268 - We could do it.\\
269 - Yeah, I got a contractor's license.\\
270 - We could add on to your bedroom here no problem at all.\\
271 - What? You knock out this wall,\\
272 - you extend out a little bit.\\
273 - We could do the whole thing for cost.\\
274 - We'll make do.\\
275 - You're not being fair to the baby, Hal.\\
276 - I know, but... Come on. Eye of the tiger!\\
277 - We create our own futures.\\
278 - Well, you know, you-you... you do what you can.\\
279 - I mean, we'll be okay as long as we...\\
280 - Oh, my God!\\
281 - Now you're committed.\\
282 - Let's get to work.\\
283 - Larry, I don't believe you!\\
284 - I invited you over for a couple of beers,\\
285 - and you punch a hole in my wall?\\
286 - This is exactly why\\
287 - I haven't seen you in all these...!\\
288 - That little bat did all that?\\
289 - This is great.\\
290 - Wait till Lois sees this.\\
291 - Dad? I don't know what he did last night,\\
292 - but there's no hot water,\\
293 - and the toilet's full of sawdust.\\
294 - Dewey, if Dad wakes up by dinner,\\
295 - - tell him I'm at Dabney's. - Okay.\\
296 - - Good afternoon. - The current time is...\\
297 - Yeah, Mom. My bed's going in the sunny spot.\\
298 - Reese's bed is going in the closet like you wanted.\\
299 - This is ridiculous.\\
300 - We're never going to make that movie.\\
301 - I'm moving as fast as I can, okay?\\
302 - He's doing a really good job, Mom.\\
303 - You may want to give him a break.\\
304 - Thanks, Dewey. You're a good brother.\\
305 - She said no.\\
306 - Don't you think it's\\
307 - a little strange that your mom keeps calling\\
308 - just so you can do Dewey's homework\\
309 - and-and fix Dewey's bike, and move\\
310 - Dewey's furniture around?\\
311 - What are you trying to say?\\
312 - It's obvious, isn't it?\\
313 - She wants you to do stuff for Dewey.\\
314 - Hey, if you want to talk to her about it...\\
315 - As a matter of fact, I do.\\
316 - Hello?\\
317 - Yes, good afternoon to you, too.\\
318 - Well, thank you,\\
319 - but I really don't need to know what time it is.\\
320 - Wait, listen to me.\\
321 - Listen to me!\\
322 - Forget it, there's no talking to her.\\
323 - Good-bye.\\
324 - Okay, good afternoon.\\
325 - God, she's polite and rude at the same time.\\
326 - Ow! Careful!\\
327 - Hold still, Mom.\\
328 - This is a tough area for us.\\
329 - Dabney, you get that. I'm going to go hop in the shower.\\
330 - If that's the Thompsons, tell them to move their car,\\
331 - then they'll get their cat back.\\
332 - Hi, Malcolm. Where's your mom?\\
333 - In the shower. Good. Then I won't have\\
334 - to put the laxative in her tea.\\
335 - We have to meet Stevie at paintball in an hour.\\
336 - Malcolm, I can't go-- Mom and I\\
337 - are going to put on our pajamas and watch videos.\\
338 - Dabney, your grandfather got you this amazing gun,\\
339 - and you have to use it.\\
340 - Look, Malcolm, I know you think I'm a mama's boy...\\
341 - No. Mama's boys are laughing at you  with  their mothers.\\
342 - Come on, I saw the look in your eye\\
343 - when you opened it.\\
344 - Admit it. You're dying to do this.\\
345 - You just have to break free from your mom.\\
346 - Malcolm, you don't understand.\\
347 - In exactly 17 minutes, she's going to open that shower door\\
348 - and expect to see me there with a warm, cozy towel.\\
349 - All right, let's go.\\
350 - Oh, my God!\\
351 - Damn it, Larry!\\
352 - Okay, think, think.\\
353 - How can I blame this on the boys?\\
354 - Good morning, princess.\\
355 - Larry!\\
356 - What have we done?\\
357 - I've actually made my crappy house even crappier.\\
358 - Yeah, we got a hell of a lot of work to do.\\
359 - You're damn right we do!\\
360 - First things first-- we're going to pay\\
361 - a little visit on our old friend Dawkins.\\
362 - What? Did a little research last night.\\
363 - Turns out he lives in a place called Carlson Estates.\\
364 - Estates, man! Can you believe that?\\
365 - He's living a life of luxury.\\
366 - You... you don't even have a wall.\\
367 - We're going to get this guy.\\
368 - Larry, we-we have to fix this. This?\\
369 - This is nothing. Two days, tops.\\
370 - You lay your foundation here, zam!\\
371 - Little electrical, zing, zing!\\
372 - Put in a bay window, vrunt! You're done.\\
373 - Now, let's go get Dawkins.\\
374 - Okay.\\
375 - Someone was out of bed bright and early this morning.\\
376 - Yeah, Gretchen left me a note.\\
377 - Can't seem to find it anywhere.\\
378 - I think it may have been\\
379 - about your violent night terrors.\\
380 - What are you talking about?\\
381 - I don't speak terrified German,\\
382 - but you must have been having some pretty horrific dreams.\\
383 - That's ridiculous. I never dream. What?\\
384 - I never dream-- I go to sleep;\\
385 - eight hours later, I wake up with a slight sore throat\\
386 - just like everybody else.\\
387 - You screamed for hours.\\
388 - I think it was  you that had the bad dream,\\
389 - but don't worry, I know just what to do.\\
390 - I will give you a nice, oily massage before bedtime,\\
391 - you will sleep like a baby.\\
392 - This is going to be sweet.\\
393 - Now, once we jump the inner fence,\\
394 - I'll take care of the dogs, you take out the cameras.\\
395 - He lives in a trailer park.\\
396 - Yeah, an awesome trailer park.\\
397 - I mean, look at that double-wide.\\
398 - You don't got a trailer like that.\\
399 - All right, commando mode.\\
400 - All right, you scale the side of the trailer.\\
401 - See if you can get in up there where the paint's peeling.\\
402 - Okay. All right, move.\\
403 - What's going on out there?\\
404 - Larry?\\
405 - Hal?\\
406 - Mr. Dawkins? Is that you?\\
407 - What a pleasant surprise.\\
408 - Come on in.\\
409 - I just put some tea on.\\
410 - Stevie, cover me!\\
411 - I'm so glad I dragged Dabney here.\\
412 - This is exactly the kind of thing he needs.\\
413 - Aren't I dead by now?\\
414 - In the game, you are.\\
415 - Dabney, just fire back!\\
416 - Don't fire back. And don't move.\\
417 - We're going to go get more ammo.\\
418 - Get... up!\\
419 - You have to shoot.\\
420 - You have to do this. Mom was right.\\
421 - I could be home watching Dark Victory  right now.\\
422 - You have to fight back! Just pull the trigger!\\
423 - But there could be adverse consequences.\\
424 - That is your mother talking!\\
425 - Just shoot it!\\
426 - If you want to be any kind of man, shoot it now.\\
427 - Haul ass!\\
428 - Brush your own damn hair!\\
429 - Get your own damn towel!\\
430 - 100! 99!\\
431 - 98! 97!\\
432 - Aaah!\\
433 - I call... Dabney's team.\\
434 - The tea is great.\\
435 - I wish I had more\\
436 - to offer you, but the Meals on Wheels van\\
437 - only comes around twice a week now.\\
438 - No, this is fine.\\
439 - You've been so... nice.\\
440 - Can I ask you something?\\
441 - See, Larry and I were talking\\
442 - about old times at the restaurant,\\
443 - and a certain Labor Day weekend came up.\\
444 - Oh, you mean the time you boys flooded the kitchen.\\
445 - Huh?\\
446 - You two were doing chin-ups\\
447 - on the water pipe.\\
448 - Oh... yeah!\\
449 - We  busted it!\\
450 - Larry, I think he's right.\\
451 - Mr. Slocumb didn't want me\\
452 - to give you your paychecks,\\
453 - but I snuck them to your dads.\\
454 - I almost got fired for that, but what's right is right.\\
455 - Well, that was illuminating.\\
456 - We now know the face of all evil\\
457 - is a feeble old man in a trailer park\\
458 - who whittles bird feeders.\\
459 - Well, I hope we've both learned something here.\\
460 - Oh, yeah.\\
461 - What the hell is wrong with you?!\\
462 - Eye of the tiger, Hal.\\
463 - Larry? Hal? Are you boys all right?\\
464 - Yeah, Mom, he just finished digging\\
465 - that underground fort you wanted.\\
466 - I think you're going to have\\
467 - a lot of fun in it. Give me that.\\
468 - Honey, don't say anything. Just listen.\\
469 - You were right. You're always right.\\
470 - From now on, I will do whatever you say,\\
471 - because I have been happier just mindlessly obeying you\\
472 - than doing what I think I want\\
473 - with any of my so-called friends.\\
474 - I love you.\\
475 - I miss you.\\
476 - Here's Dewey.\\
477 - Really, Mom?\\
478 - You want me to cut Reese's hair?\\
479 - But he  loves  his hair.\\
480 - Okay.\\
481 - This is so unfair.\\
482 - Just get it over with.\\
483 - Mohawks are kind of out, Mom.\\
484 - What if I...\\
485 - Do you hear a strange ringing, Mom?\\
486 - You are so dead!\\
487 - And the last thing I remember\\
488 - is him shoving paint balls up my nose.\\
489 - Good. Then let's just say that's where he stopped.\\
490 - - Where's my boy?! - What have you done\\
491 - with my poor, delicate boy?!\\
492 - Oh, my God!\\
493 - This is  your  fault, you evil little Svengali!\\
494 - I knew I shouldn't let Dabney have any friends!\\
495 - Now, Dabney, where... Get the car.\\
496 - We're going home.\\
497 - Dabney, you've never spoken to me like this before.\\
498 - Well, get used to it.\\
499 - I'm not your little boy anymore, Mom.\\
500 - I'm your little  man.\\
501 - Oh, my.\\
502 - Oh...\\
503 - Oh, Dabney. Oh!\\
504 - "Dear Francis, to stop Otto's night terrors,\\
505 - "just caress his  Ohrlappchen.\\
506 - Gretchen."\\
507 - His Ohrlappchen?\\
508 - Please, please, please, please, please.\\
509 - Ah...\\
510 - Thank you.
\subsection {Episode 15: Garage Sale}
1 - Malcolm, Malcolm, in school, we learned the coolest thing.\\
2 - There were these people who did this broadcast\\
3 - and convinced everyone that aliens were landing.\\
4 - So, what we do\\
5 - is we wait for Reese to fall asleep,\\
6 - then we flash some lights outside his window,\\
7 - and we go to the TV, but we'll have made a tape...\\
8 - Dewey, you're totally overthinking this.\\
9 - Reese, aliens landed down the street!\\
10 - Every man for himself!\\
11 - Oh.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Mom is coming home a week early from Aunt Susan's.\\
25 - We did all right with her gone, but we still have\\
26 - a couple things to take care of before she gets back.\\
27 - Move it, move it.\\
28 - Now, remember, boys, if you see the bobcat,\\
29 - don't be a hero.\\
30 - Stand on a chair and use your whistle.\\
31 - Get out of here, Foamy! Go home!\\
32 - You think she'll notice the grass fire?\\
33 - Just remember, as far as we know,\\
34 - Dewey has always been missing the tip of his finger.\\
35 - Boys, we're home.\\
36 - Oh, boys, I've missed you so!\\
37 - Dad knocked down your bedroom wall.\\
38 - What?\\
39 - Honey, I-I know it doesn't look like much,\\
40 - but this is just the beginning stages\\
41 - of a major expansion.\\
42 - I have conceptual drawings here.\\
43 - Look, look.\\
44 - See how it continues onto my hand?\\
45 - It was going to be something really nice for you and the baby\\
46 - with a window seat, and please just promise\\
47 - you won't get mad and leave again!\\
48 - Hal, I'm just so glad to be home!\\
49 - Oh!\\
50 - Ugh! My sister is the most obnoxious,\\
51 - sanctimonious know-it-all I've ever met.\\
52 - She spent every minute of my visit\\
53 - telling me everything I've ever done wrong in my life.\\
54 - It was just awful.\\
55 - Tell me about it.\\
56 - Dating her was the worst five years of my life.\\
57 - Well, you know why she's like that, don't you?\\
58 - My parents.\\
59 - Susan was always the pretty one,\\
60 - Susan was the smart one, Susan was the one with all the talent.\\
61 - I was the one that couldn't do anything right.\\
62 - Hal, it got me thinking about Reese.\\
63 - As if you weren't feeling bad enough.\\
64 - No, Hal, I don't think that we give Reese enough credit.\\
65 - I think that if we gave Reese a little more responsibility,\\
66 - he would rise to the challenge.\\
67 - Now, I'm not talking about giving him\\
68 - a key to the house, or anything.\\
69 - I just think some encouragement would do him good.\\
70 - Okay.\\
71 - Ooh.\\
72 - Honey, come here.\\
73 - The eggs have hatched.\\
74 - Morning.\\
75 - Dewey, Mom's home.\\
76 - Huh?\\
77 - Oh. Right.\\
78 - So, it's going to cost\\
79 - at least $800 to close up the wall.\\
80 - I suppose I can go back to work at the drugstore.\\
81 - Really? Yeah.\\
82 - I'm sure I can stand\\
83 - on my feet for eight hours a day.\\
84 - And if you fall, the amniotic fluid\\
85 - provides a great cushion.\\
86 - We'll think of something.\\
87 - Hey, there's tons of stuff\\
88 - we don't use in the garage.\\
89 - Why don't we just put it out on the front lawn\\
90 - and see if we can sell it?\\
91 - You mean like a garage sale?\\
92 - That's a terrific idea, Reese.\\
93 - Don't you think that's a great idea, Hal?\\
94 - Actually, I was the one...\\
95 - And you know what?\\
96 - You can be in charge.\\
97 - You can organize the stuff, you can set the prices,\\
98 - you can pick the date.\\
99 - Why? I didn't do anything.\\
100 - Reese, this isn't a punishment.\\
101 - This is us demonstrating our faith in you,\\
102 - because I know\\
103 - you are going to do a great job.\\
104 - We believe in you.\\
105 - Don't we, Hal?\\
106 - For God's sakes, he's my son.\\
107 - I mean, I love him.\\
108 - Just answer the question, Hal.\\
109 - Who wants juice?\\
110 - I do!\\
111 - You can't just sell all my old stuff.\\
112 - Everything in that garage\\
113 - represents a precious childhood memory.\\
114 - It's a bunch of old magazines, a broken yo-yo\\
115 - and a Rubik's cube painted all one color.\\
116 - Well, you try and solve that thing!\\
117 - I'm not going to argue with you.\\
118 - You have ten seconds to come up with a good reason\\
119 - to keep all that junk,\\
120 - or I'm getting rid of it.\\
121 - See, this is why you are a terrible mother.\\
122 - Because everything has to be a competition with you!\\
123 - Oh, it does not.\\
124 - I'm hanging up! I'm hanging up first.\\
125 - No, I'm hanging... Damn it!\\
126 - You mustn't talk about your family like that, Francis.\\
127 - There is nothing more important than...\\
128 - It's a letter from our son, Rutger!\\
129 - We must hide this immediately.\\
130 - Why do you have to hide a letter from your son?\\
131 - Otto, no!\\
132 - What are you doing?\\
133 - Nothing, because this did not happen.\\
134 - Nothing happened.\\
135 - Except for me telling you that nothing happened.\\
136 - That happened, but only that.\\
137 - Things will begin to happen again, starting...\\
138 - now!\\
139 - Oh, look, the mail came.\\
140 - Hmm, hmm, hmm.\\
141 - Soon as the swelling in my ankles goes down,\\
142 - I'm going to get right back to work with you boys.\\
143 - Thank you, honey.\\
144 - No matter what it does to the baby.\\
145 - Reese, if you put the heavy boxes down first,\\
146 - and  then  stack the light ones on top...\\
147 - It just kills you I'm in charge, doesn't it?\\
148 - Oh, wow!\\
149 - What's that?\\
150 - This is the transmitter\\
151 - from the pirate radio station I had in college!\\
152 - It was only a couple of watts, but I brought the truth\\
153 - to everyone within three blocks of the west side of campus.\\
154 - Until the FCC\\
155 - shut me down for telling it like it was.\\
156 - And for not having a license.\\
157 - See, the way it works...\\
158 - I was just trying to be polite.\\
159 - I didn't think you were going to punish me for it.\\
160 - Hey, there, Sparky.\\
161 - So, half the campus is\\
162 - goose-stepping down to the bonfire\\
163 - to be brainwashed by the Stepford cheerleaders--\\
164 - the pied pipers of pep.\\
165 - They want us to forget why we came to this institution,\\
166 - but not Kid Charlemagne.\\
167 - I am here to seek knowledge.\\
168 - Let's get going, Hal.\\
169 - And don't forget your head.\\
170 - Righty-o.\\
171 - I remember this toy.\\
172 - I begged for it for months.\\
173 - It was supposed to move and talk and learn my name.\\
174 - But the stupid thing never worked.\\
175 - Robot, robot, robot,\\
176 - robot, robot, robot...\\
177 - Okay, now I need a five-inch girder.\\
178 - Coming right up.\\
179 - Hey, look, my baseball glove.\\
180 - Hey, look, my baseball glove.\\
181 - Dad, is this yours?\\
182 - No, it must have been my roommate's.\\
183 - You know, I think it might be something...\\
184 - Throw it out. It's garbage.\\
185 - Reese, maybe we should try to find out what it is.\\
186 - Mom!\\
187 - Malcolm's not respecting my leadership!\\
188 - Malcolm, you respect Reese's leadership!\\
189 -     Jeremiah was a bullfrog...    \\
190 - Ooh, come on.\\
191 - Come on.\\
192 - Yes!\\
193 - He said he'd return.\\
194 - He couldn't be silenced.\\
195 - Kid Charlemagne is back on the air.\\
196 - Otto always planned\\
197 - that when Rutger finished college,\\
198 - he would come out here  und live with us on the ranch.\\
199 - But instead, he insisted on going to medical school.\\
200 - And when he was named chief surgeon of his hospital,\\
201 - Otto was crushed.\\
202 - It's so strange he never\\
203 - mentioned any of this.\\
204 - That is Otto's Teutonic pride.\\
205 - He will never, ever show his feelings to anyone.\\
206 - Welcome to the Grotto.\\
207 - I'm sure you will enjoy your stay.\\
208 - And don't forget to visit the gift shop.\\
209 - Oh... perhaps tomorrow,\\
210 - you would like to go horseback riding\\
211 - on Uncle Otto's pony!\\
212 - Malcolm, dinner!\\
213 - Hal, I'm not going to call you again!\\
214 - There are so many things\\
215 - the government doesn't want you to know,\\
216 - and that's why they don't want Kid Charlemagne on this mic.\\
217 - Do I love my country? Yes.\\
218 - Do I vote?\\
219 - I used to, until they moved our polling place\\
220 - to the house with the big dog.\\
221 - Hal! I said dinner!\\
222 - Kid Charlemagne is back on the air.\\
223 - I think we should start the garage sale around 7:00,\\
224 - because serious shoppers like to get an early start.\\
225 - Unless you have a different idea,\\
226 - which I'm sure would be great.\\
227 - I was thinking 11:30.\\
228 - So I could watch cartoons.\\
229 - Oh, so you'll be\\
230 - well rested and better able to focus.\\
231 - Good thinking.\\
232 - Where were you this afternoon?\\
233 - I instructed you to separate the twist ties according to length.\\
234 - He's been like this all day.\\
235 - I was doing homework.\\
236 - No homework takes more than 20 minutes.\\
237 - Hal, what are you doing out there?\\
238 - I've been gone for six weeks,\\
239 - and now that I'm home, I barely see you.\\
240 - I missed you, too.\\
241 - Why don't I put on some music?\\
242 - What is this childish need you have to defy my authority?\\
243 - Bite me. Just when I was starting\\
244 - to feel confident in my abilities.\\
245 - Malcolm, I am sick of you always putting your brother down.\\
246 - This is Reese's project, and you are going to be supportive.\\
247 - And if the government doesn't have a car\\
248 - that runs on water, then what are they\\
249 - building all those dams for?\\
250 - Reese is in charge of this garage sale,\\
251 - and you are going to obey him.\\
252 - No matter what he asks you to do,\\
253 - you are going to do it.\\
254 - But he's... Malcolm, you can either let him\\
255 - be in charge of you for the garage sale,\\
256 - or you can let him be in charge of you\\
257 - every day for the rest of your life.\\
258 - In case you haven't noticed,\\
259 - "Evian" spelled backwards is "naive"!\\
260 - Wow, it's like\\
261 - that guy is saying what we're all thinking.\\
262 - Hal, will you\\
263 - turn that racket off?\\
264 - Well, I guess I can't expect\\
265 - a suburban housewife to understand.\\
266 - Dewey, what are you doing?\\
267 - A tennis ball doesn't go with the football.\\
268 - It goes with the ceramic bananas.\\
269 - This is stupid.\\
270 - Why are we sorting everything by color?\\
271 - Because I say so.\\
272 - And because alphabetical order was slowing us down.\\
273 - Us?\\
274 - This better be good.\\
275 - There'll be hell to pay\\
276 - if Jellybean wakes up from her massage\\
277 - and doesn't see me on the table next to her.\\
278 - Oh, my God!\\
279 - Is that a Nortair?\\
280 - It's a Nortair 680b.\\
281 - It's, like, the first personal computer ever made.\\
282 - You have an interest in this type of stuff, don't you?\\
283 - There aren't many of these left.\\
284 - I'll give you five bucks for it.\\
285 - Yeah, right.\\
286 - I checked online.\\
287 - This is in mint condition.\\
288 - It's worth at least $1,300.\\
289 - Deal. No take-backs,\\
290 - double black magic, tap it, bomb it,\\
291 - flush it down the toilet.\\
292 - You understand it's going to take me a couple days\\
293 - to get the money. That's exactly what I want.\\
294 - I want you to buy it\\
295 - this Saturday at our garage sale.\\
296 - In front of everybody. With cash.\\
297 - You're going to react in horror\\
298 - when I tell you Reese was going to throw this in the trash.\\
299 - And then you're going\\
300 - to tell everyone they should\\
301 - have listened to  me  all along.\\
302 - You know, right now\\
303 - you're sounding a lot like a James Bond villain.\\
304 - Me? There's nothing wrong with me.\\
305 - I'm fine.\\
306 - And right.\\
307 - And  right!\\
308 - And on Saturday,\\
309 - everyone's going to know it.\\
310 - Okay, but these revenge plans have a way of backfiring.\\
311 - Word to the wise,\\
312 - if you ever make someone an Ex-Lax milkshake,\\
313 - don't do it on an empty stomach.\\
314 - Someone is looking down at you\\
315 - from a satellite with his finger on the death beam,\\
316 - and somewhere, someone is watching him.\\
317 - But who's watching that...\\
318 - Oh, no! Oh, no.\\
319 - Sir, do you know why I pulled you over?\\
320 - Certainly not for operating an illegal pirate radio station.\\
321 - I mean, even if I did have the equipment in college,\\
322 - I wouldn't have kept it and be using it today.\\
323 - What's with all these questions, anyway?\\
324 - Do you have a warrant?!\\
325 - You ran a stop sign a half mile back.\\
326 - What?\\
327 - There's no stop sign back there.\\
328 - It's at the driveway to the country club.\\
329 - They just put it up.\\
330 - That stop sign is a declaration of war!\\
331 - It's for the fat cats\\
332 - up on top of the hill playing golf\\
333 - while us regular Joes are late for our second job,\\
334 - or church or dinner with our families.\\
335 - "Well, I'm sorry\\
336 - "I missed Little Bobby's first steps, honey,\\
337 - "but I had to come to a complete stop\\
338 - just because those robber barons can't look both ways!"\\
339 - Gretchen, what are you doing?\\
340 - I was just going through some\\
341 - of Rutger's things from when he was a boy.\\
342 - Boy, I don't remember that he was so fat.\\
343 - Schlupi!\\
344 - Who's Schlupi?\\
345 - Otto and Rutger used to love Schlupi.\\
346 - Otto would put Schlupi on,\\
347 - and Rutger would laugh and laugh.\\
348 - It was almost\\
349 - like a little brother to him.\\
350 - Schlupi could say all of the things that Otto couldn't.\\
351 - Like, "Go to bed."\\
352 - And "Behave yourself."\\
353 - And "Take your finger out of there, it's disgusting!"\\
354 - Oh, the love in that house.\\
355 - And now...\\
356 - it's gone.\\
357 - Gretchen, I hate seeing you so upset.\\
358 - You've got to talk to Otto about this.\\
359 - There is no getting through to him.\\
360 - He won't even admit that anything is wrong.\\
361 - Oh!\\
362 - Oh... Oh.\\
363 -     Oklahoma    \\
364 -     Where the wind comes sweeping down the plain    \\
365 -     And the waving wheat...    \\
366 - So you have the money, right?\\
367 - Yes. It cost me three Little Lulus\\
368 - and a Captain Picard plate.\\
369 - I hope you're happy.\\
370 - I'll go get the computer.\\
371 - You memorize this script.\\
372 - Reese, that's a great idea you're probably having\\
373 - to help that lady\\
374 - who's trying to buy something.\\
375 - Yeah, okay.\\
376 - Can I help you?\\
377 - How much for the vacuum?\\
378 - That's a set. You can only buy that if you buy the lamp.\\
379 - But I don't need a lamp.\\
380 - Then you don't need a vacuum.\\
381 - She'll be back.\\
382 - And the lamp isn't going without the blender.\\
383 - You've obviously put a lot of thought into this.\\
384 - Where the heck does your father\\
385 - keep disappearing to?\\
386 - And then the stop sign army spring into action,\\
387 - all in support\\
388 - of the military industrial country club complex.\\
389 - But that's not where it ends.\\
390 - Ooh.\\
391 - Okay, pay attention to this.\\
392 - How many sides to a stop sign?\\
393 - Eight.\\
394 - That's just a little too close to the number of judges\\
395 - on the Supreme Court for this citizen.\\
396 - Hang on a second, America.\\
397 - Thank you very much.\\
398 - That's  my  piggy bank!\\
399 - That was in my room!\\
400 - Relax, dipwad. I got two bucks for it.\\
401 - It had $16 in it!\\
402 - Wah-wah.\\
403 - Spilt milk.\\
404 - Mom, stupid Reese just did\\
405 - the stupidest thing to my...\\
406 - You're as bad as Malcolm.\\
407 - I don't want to hear any more complaining out of you\\
408 - for the rest of the day, understood?\\
409 - Now, go! Help your brother.\\
410 - Excuse me,\\
411 - do you have a microwave for sale?\\
412 - No, we...\\
413 - Well, actually, yes.\\
414 - Yes, we do.\\
415 - Follow me.\\
416 - Excuse me, Malcolm, it's me, Craig.\\
417 - What's that you're holding in your hands?\\
418 - You mean this thing that I've been trying to save?\\
419 - That Reese has insisted all along\\
420 - was mere junk?\\
421 - Mere junk?\\
422 - Why, your brother couldn't be more wrong,\\
423 - nor you more right.\\
424 - Please\\
425 - allow me to buy it from you\\
426 - for the princely sum of...\\
427 - Come with me.\\
428 - Dad, what are you doing?\\
429 - Craig, get back here!\\
430 - Mom... What are you doing with that?\\
431 - I ordered you to throw this away!\\
432 - Let go of it, you idiot!\\
433 - Give it! No!\\
434 - There you go-- $16.\\
435 - Thank you.\\
436 - Hey, is that stereo for sale?\\
437 - Make me an offer.\\
438 - ...because we believe in the Constitution!\\
439 - We don't think that the Constitution\\
440 - is an empty promise.\\
441 - We believe in the Bill of Rights, don't we?\\
442 - Well, I never understood\\
443 - what the big deal was about quartering soldiers.\\
444 - I mean, as long as I don't have to change in front of them.\\
445 - It's the spirit of free speech!\\
446 - It's the fundamental\\
447 - freedom that thousands of men have given their lives for!\\
448 - Hang a left here on Riverton.\\
449 - Attention, you are conducting a broadcast\\
450 - in direct violation of FCC Rule 27.\\
451 - Pull over.\\
452 - I'm not going down without a fight!\\
453 - I'm the voice of the little man!\\
454 - The man on the girder.\\
455 - The man on the streets.\\
456 - The man that fights The Man!\\
457 - Oh, my God!\\
458 - You're Kid Charlemagne.\\
459 - Give it! No!\\
460 - Let go!\\
461 - Reese, don't, you stupid jackass.\\
462 - You don't know what you're doing!\\
463 - That is enough out of you!\\
464 - Are you really so insecure that you can't stand\\
465 - anyone else getting any attention?\\
466 - Your brother has worked so hard\\
467 - to make this yard sale a success,\\
468 - he doesn't need you undermining him at ever turn.\\
469 - Mom, you have to listen to me.\\
470 - We have a Nortair 680b.\\
471 - It's a type of computer\\
472 - that was built in 1976.\\
473 - There's only a few in existence.\\
474 - And Craig is going to give us $1,300 for it.\\
475 - $1,300?\\
476 - Oh, my God.\\
477 - What are you doing?!\\
478 - I have a lot of things to sell,\\
479 - and I don't have time to argue with this bozo.\\
480 - I've got a Jet Ski\\
481 - on hold, and the place closes at 6:00.\\
482 - What are you talking about?\\
483 - I'm buying a jet ski with my yard sale money.\\
484 - That money isn't yours.\\
485 - It's going to rebuild our bedroom wall.\\
486 - But you said I was in charge.\\
487 - That means I  get the money!\\
488 - No, it doesn't.\\
489 - Then why the hell would I want to be in charge?\\
490 - Reese, this is helping you become a better person\\
491 - by building your self-esteem,\\
492 - which you are obviously going to need\\
493 - if you are stupid enough to throw away $1,300\\
494 - that this family desperately needs!\\
495 - I'm cooperating!\\
496 - I never met this man before.\\
497 - I hate the Constitution.\\
498 - I hate free speech.\\
499 - I'll snitch.\\
500 - I know things!\\
501 - What on earth?\\
502 - Stop! Government agent!\\
503 - Fare warning, sir!\\
504 - Running adds an additional $80 to your fine!\\
505 - Otto, come out.\\
506 - I know you're in here.\\
507 - This is ridiculous.\\
508 - It's been three days.\\
509 - Look, I know you don't want to talk about this,\\
510 - but you can't just keep hiding.\\
511 - Are you happy like this?\\
512 - Don't I look happy?\\
513 - Gretchen is freaking out.\\
514 - The guests are leaving in droves.\\
515 - And Muffy wants her stall back.\\
516 - You have to stop this.\\
517 - There is nothing to stop, because there's nothing wrong.\\
518 - Now go away.\\
519 - Look, if there's one thing I'm an expert at,\\
520 - it's pointless family conflict.\\
521 - And if Rutger is anything like me,\\
522 - you're going to have to make the first move.\\
523 - That means you're going to have to deal with your feelings.\\
524 - I can't.\\
525 - I know you can't.\\
526 - That's why I want you to do something for me.\\
527 - Hmm?\\
528 - Look at your wedding ring.\\
529 - Hmm?\\
530 - Oh.\\
531 - Schlupi?\\
532 - Yes, Schlupi.\\
533 - I think it's about time he weighed in on all this.\\
534 - I guess I was a little disappointed\\
535 - when Rutger wouldn't come.\\
536 - And then\\
537 - when the letters came,\\
538 - it was so painful.\\
539 - I couldn't bear it.\\
540 - I love him so much, Francis.\\
541 - And I swore that I would never do that to my son,\\
542 - and now look!\\
543 - Rutger is such a wonderful boy.\\
544 - He's so sensitive.\\
545 - He's-he's so bright...\\
546 - I'm going to get Schlupi a phone.\\
547 - I'll tell you one thing.\\
548 - 20 years ago, I would have cleared that fence.\\
549 - And the open manhole.\\
550 - Oh, God.\\
551 - How could I have been so wrong about Reese?\\
552 - Hal, just say it again, please.\\
553 - I really need to hear it.\\
554 - Okay, okay.\\
555 - Reese...\\
556 - is hopeless.\\
557 - Thank you.\\
558 - Ah, sorry.\\
559 - Hello?\\
560 - Mom? Francis?\\
561 - Listen, I've been doing some thinking,\\
562 - and I just wanted to tell you\\
563 - that even though we haven't always gotten along,\\
564 - I guess you thought you were doing\\
565 - what was best for me, and... well, I appreciate it.\\
566 - Wow.\\
567 - Francis, what brought this on?\\
568 - I don't know.\\
569 - I guess I just had a breakthrough.\\
570 - Anyway, I wanted to tell you about this thing\\
571 - that happened in junior high...
\subsection {Episode 16: Academic Octathlon}
1 - No fair. He moved.\\
2 - Too bad.\\
3 - You've got H-O-R-S.\\
4 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
5 -     I don't know    \\
6 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     And you're not so big    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     Life is unfair.    \\
16 - Does this chip look funny to you?\\
17 - Nope. It's fine.\\
18 - Ha, ha. You took the last one.\\
19 - You have to refill it.\\
20 - Oh, darn it.\\
21 - Oh, great.\\
22 - It's an ant.\\
23 - I know.\\
24 - I saw him before.\\
25 - No, Dewey, you don't understand.\\
26 - This one's the scout.\\
27 - If he finds anything appetizing,\\
28 - soon there'll be lots and lots of ants.\\
29 - Which is why I'm about to make sure\\
30 - that this scout doesn't report back to headquarters.\\
31 - Dewey, bedtime!\\
32 - Ready, Dad?\\
33 - Bedtime express.\\
34 - Oh... yeah.\\
35 - Just give me a second here to...\\
36 - Hidey-ho! Oh!\\
37 - And away we go!\\
38 - Giddy-up, Dad!\\
39 - Turn, horsey, turn!\\
40 - I got the nicest dress for the school formal.\\
41 - It's satiny and long,\\
42 - and-and what's that color between pink and purple?\\
43 - Mauve.\\
44 - Oh, sorry.\\
45 - Isn't she cute when she gets excited?\\
46 - Her cheeks get all red,\\
47 - and then she gets a little twinkle in her eye.\\
48 - I've got to tell you, I'm a lucky guy.\\
49 - So you're really going to spring\\
50 - for a limo and tux and all that?\\
51 - Hell, no. We're not going to that dance.\\
52 - It would practically wipe out my leather jacket fund.\\
53 - What are you talking about?\\
54 - I've got it all worked out.\\
55 - I let her think we're going,\\
56 - and then right before the dance, I pick a giant fight.\\
57 - She gets so mad at me, she doesn't want to go,\\
58 - and then the next day,\\
59 - I apologize, she takes me back,\\
60 - and it's smooth sailing until her birthday.\\
61 - Malcolm!\\
62 - Where have you been?\\
63 - I called an emergency study session.\\
64 - What? We just had an emergency study session last night.\\
65 - This is the Academic Octathlon.\\
66 - We are pitted against the brightest minds\\
67 - from every high school in the country.\\
68 - From now on, we will work through lunch every day.\\
69 - I thought this was supposed to be fun.\\
70 - Fun... is for losers.\\
71 - We're all making sacrifices, Malcolm.\\
72 - I've had to blow off my cello lessons.\\
73 - I missed my uncle's funeral.\\
74 - I've been tanking my grades for the past three months\\
75 - so I could be our team's mandatory "C" student.\\
76 - That food is not there for you to eat,\\
77 - it is there so I don't get into trouble for making you work\\
78 - through lunch. Now focus!\\
79 - Why  can't  I quit?\\
80 - This is  stupid!\\
81 - Extracurriculars are very important.\\
82 - You think you can coast into college on straight A's?\\
83 - Well, you can't.\\
84 - Besides, this is a good opportunity\\
85 - to meet other smart kids.\\
86 - You're never too young to start making contacts.\\
87 - Yeah, make friends for life at a nerdfest.\\
88 - It's not nerdy to spend a weekend\\
89 - winning a trophy that shows how smart you are!\\
90 - Well, you're doing it anyway.\\
91 - Oh, geez, not the cabinets, too.\\
92 - Honey, where did I put the ant spray?\\
93 - Hey, Dad, time for bedtime express.\\
94 - Uh, yeah.\\
95 - Dewey, look, I-I want to talk to you.\\
96 - Uh, you're getting bigger,\\
97 - and-and there's a lot of great things\\
98 - about being a big boy,\\
99 - but big boys don't get to do bedtime express,\\
100 - because it hurts Daddy, so even though it's fun,\\
101 - we're not going to do bedtime express anymore.\\
102 - Okay.\\
103 - Oh, good.\\
104 - Then I won't love you anymore.\\
105 - What?\\
106 - I won't love you anymore.\\
107 - Dewey, you can't just say something like that\\
108 - because you're upset.\\
109 - I'm sorry, but I can't help the way I feel.\\
110 - Good night, Dad.\\
111 - Reese, did you get your tux yet?\\
112 - Uh, the dance is in two days.\\
113 - Of course I got my tux.\\
114 - Good. Hey, look at this.\\
115 - It's my dress.\\
116 - Isn't it amazing?\\
117 - Are you sure this is going to fit because...\\
118 - you're so fat.\\
119 - Oh, you're such a goofball sometimes.\\
120 - Anyway, I really like these bows.\\
121 - Maybe I should get matching shoes,\\
122 - but I don't want it to look too outfit-y.\\
123 - Hey, honey,\\
124 - you won't believe the day I had.\\
125 - I had a pretty interesting day, too.\\
126 - I had to wear these\\
127 - filthy clothes to work\\
128 - because you forgot to pick up the dry cleaning again.\\
129 - For crying out loud,\\
130 - I just got off a 12-hour shift.\\
131 - The last thing I need is for you to...\\
132 - You know what?\\
133 - Let's not do this.\\
134 - Do what?\\
135 - Fight.\\
136 - We argue way too much.\\
137 - You're right.\\
138 - Why can't we just both shut up for once\\
139 - and give ourselves time to be in love with each other?\\
140 - Let's just... not talk about it.\\
141 - I am having the best time with Piama today.\\
142 - It's like every moment was perfect,\\
143 - and-and seemed to blend perfectly\\
144 - into the next perfect moment.\\
145 - I have had 25 years of days like that\\
146 - with my Gretchen.\\
147 - I heard that, schminky pants.\\
148 - I will save this for later.\\
149 - See, when marriage works, there is nothing like it.\\
150 - Now let me ask you something.\\
151 - You and Gretchen--\\
152 - you never argue about chores, right?\\
153 - Like, if there's an errand to be run,\\
154 - you do it, she does it, who cares?\\
155 - I never really thought about it.\\
156 - I am sick and tired of doing all of these chores!\\
157 - Ooh!\\
158 - I work hard all day!\\
159 - I work like a dog, and you don't appreciate it!\\
160 - You just spend money on whatever you want!\\
161 - I  spend?!\\
162 - You spend money\\
163 - like we have a key to the mint or someplace!\\
164 -     The square root of 8,649 bottles    \\
165 -     Of non-alcoholic beer on the wall    \\
166 -     The square root of 8,649 bottles...    \\
167 -     Beer    \\
168 -     Take one down, pass it around    \\
169 -     The square root of 8,464 bottles    \\
170 -     Of non-alcoholic beer on the wall...    \\
171 - In case you're wondering, they're only at 92 bottles.\\
172 - Octathletes, I have news.\\
173 - One of my informers has just reported to me\\
174 - that the science portion of this competition will be\\
175 - based on organic chemistry, so break out your textbooks.\\
176 - We'll start with chapters 23, 24,\\
177 - 42, 44, 45...\\
178 - Sir?\\
179 - I'm supposed to take a two-hour nap on the bus,\\
180 - or I'll get cranky.\\
181 - Of course. Would you like us all\\
182 - to sing you a lullaby, or perhaps,\\
183 - I could wad up my jacket and make a pillow for you?\\
184 - I have my own pillow, thank you.\\
185 - I just need some help blowing it up.\\
186 - I've had it with this bellyaching!\\
187 - If any of you are not fully committed to this team,\\
188 - you are more than welcome to get off the bus right now.\\
189 - Driver, open the doors.\\
190 - I did not say stop.\\
191 - I said open the doors.\\
192 - That silly fighting.\\
193 - Let us never do that again.\\
194 - That is not us.\\
195 - No.\\
196 - I don't know what came over me.\\
197 - Oh, me, neither, hmm?\\
198 - We will never speak of this again, hmm?\\
199 - Of what?\\
200 - See, I already forgot it.\\
201 - Here...\\
202 - Here you are. Oh, thank you.\\
203 - I am sure you two\\
204 - will be very happy here.\\
205 - We could be happy  anywhere.\\
206 - Aw.\\
207 - Let me ask you something.\\
208 - I do plenty of chores, okay?! Yeah, right!\\
209 - You may not realize it,\\
210 - because you're out throwing our money away!\\
211 - Oh, here we go! By the way,\\
212 - are we actually going to have sex on this vacation,\\
213 - or is it going to be St. Croix all over again?!\\
214 - I've got to get a stronger spray!\\
215 - Dewey, I'm going to the hardware store.\\
216 - I'll be back soon. Love you.\\
217 - That's nice.\\
218 - Okay, this is crazy.\\
219 - You can't  not  love me\\
220 - just because I won't give you bedtime rides.\\
221 - Yes, I can.\\
222 - Oh, this is not going to work, mister.\\
223 - I know you love me.\\
224 - I like you.\\
225 - And that's it?\\
226 - I think you're a nice man.\\
227 - Fine. You know what?\\
228 - Maybe you need to spend some time in your room\\
229 - and think about this a while, okay?\\
230 - As of right now, you are grounded!\\
231 - Okay.\\
232 - And then tomorrow...\\
233 - I'm going to buy you a brand-new bicycle.\\
234 - It's not going to change anything.\\
235 - Food fight!\\
236 - What the hell are you doing?!\\
237 - Come on! It's a food fight.\\
238 - No, it's not.\\
239 - You're just throwing egg salad at me.\\
240 - Yeah, 'cause that's the kind of thing I think is fun.\\
241 - You are such a jerk!\\
242 - That's it!\\
243 - I don't ever want to see you again.\\
244 - Until the dance!\\
245 - Here it is, children.\\
246 - The battlefield.\\
247 - Get comfortable with it.\\
248 - Make it your own.\\
249 - I'm getting a panic rash over my homesick rash.\\
250 - Suck it up, people.\\
251 - Tomorrow is the finals.\\
252 - Now, do you see that air conditioning vent?\\
253 - Jefferson High has three asthmatics on their team.\\
254 - If we could just get them to sit directly beneath...\\
255 - Mr. Baffert. Oh, you've done it again.\\
256 - What a stellar job at organizing...\\
257 - Don't suck up, Lionel.\\
258 - It's pathetic.\\
259 - Don't worry, sir.\\
260 - We were ready to grab your ankles\\
261 - if you got too far up there.\\
262 - Hey, Herkabe.\\
263 - Surprised to see you and your band of bed-wetters\\
264 - had the guts to show up.\\
265 - Oh, look, it's North High.\\
266 - Nous les nourrirons leurs propres entrailles\\
267 - et fait les demande plus.\\
268 - Oh, my God.\\
269 - They brought in Rubinger from Minnesota.\\
270 - Who? IBM's been studying him.\\
271 - Rumor has it he was a Siamese twin\\
272 - that got both brains.\\
273 - Walk with me.\\
274 - You see those little freaks over there\\
275 - that you call friends now?\\
276 - They need to win here\\
277 - so they can get into one of the top colleges\\
278 - because that's the only way\\
279 - they're going to become successful enough\\
280 - so that people don't beat them up every day\\
281 - for the rest of their lives.\\
282 - Now, are you going to deny them that?\\
283 - I'll try my best.\\
284 - Good. Now, the judges\\
285 - will spot Morse code easily,\\
286 - so I've developed this rudimentary fingertip semaphore.\\
287 - Memorize this.\\
288 - You want me to cheat?\\
289 - Let's call it...\\
290 - success advantaging.\\
291 - Forget it. I'm not going to cheat.\\
292 - Guys...\\
293 - Guys, you're not going to believe this.\\
294 - Herkabe actually wants us to cheat.\\
295 - What? That isn't right!\\
296 - Yeah, he's not supposed to write it down.\\
297 - That's a paper trail.\\
298 - You guys are in on this?\\
299 - Malcolm, you have no idea.\\
300 - This is big.\\
301 - This goes further than you know.\\
302 - Further than you guys?\\
303 - Oh.\\
304 - Then you do know.\\
305 - Are you in... or are you...\\
306 - out?\\
307 - Hey! Hey!\\
308 - I'm the one who has to fix that if you break it.\\
309 - Sorry. You work here?\\
310 - My dad's the manager.\\
311 - You know, for a bunch of dweebs,\\
312 - you guys sure cause a lot of trouble.\\
313 - I can't believe you put on SPF45.\\
314 - It's an indoor pool.\\
315 - But we have to cross through the courtyard to get there.\\
316 - How can you be around them for more than ten seconds\\
317 - and not want to deck one?\\
318 - Trust me, it's not that satisfying.\\
319 - Plus, some of them are my friends.\\
320 - Were my friends.\\
321 - No, still are.\\
322 - I'm just not happy about it.\\
323 - What would you do if your friends\\
324 - wanted you to do something you didn't want to do?\\
325 - Not do it. Yeah, but see, that won't work.\\
326 - Because even if I don't, they're going to do it anyway.\\
327 - And that makes me a part of it, whether I do it or not,\\
328 - so there's no way out.\\
329 - Um, there's probably some kind of obvious smart-guy reason\\
330 - I'm missing here, but... can't you just leave?\\
331 - Reese! How many times have I told you?\\
332 - No ice cream in the living room.\\
333 - You're dripping all over the rug!\\
334 - Are you crazy?!\\
335 - No, just extremely disrespectful.\\
336 - I mean, what are you going to do\\
337 - with a kid like me? Ground me?\\
338 - You bet I am.\\
339 - One week in your room.\\
340 - No TV, no video games,\\
341 - no contact with the outside world.\\
342 - After you take Alison to the dance.\\
343 - What?!\\
344 - Reese, you made a promise\\
345 - to that girl and you are going to keep it.\\
346 - But... how did you...?\\
347 - Look, Reese, some people are born book-smart.\\
348 - Others are born crafty and street-smart.\\
349 - You, I'm afraid, are neither.\\
350 - Hello?\\
351 - Mom, come get me.\\
352 - Look, I have to get out of here.\\
353 - I'm leaving either way.\\
354 - If you're not here within the next three hours,\\
355 - you can find me walking on the highway, in the dark.\\
356 - Or maybe I'll hitchhike.\\
357 - You know, I met this guy with a van.\\
358 - He seemed real friendly.\\
359 - You should do more chores!\\
360 - I'm too tired. You should spend less money!\\
361 - We never have sex! Are you too tired for that?\\
362 - How can we when your parents are always visiting?\\
363 - I cannot wait until I am old and senile.\\
364 - I'm going to be\\
365 - hooked up to life support in your attic\\
366 - running you ragged with crazy old person demands.\\
367 - I am going to cling to life for years\\
368 - just to make you suffer.\\
369 - Fine. But I'm not staying here.\\
370 - That son of a...\\
371 - Stop the car!\\
372 - What? Stop!\\
373 - I'm staying.\\
374 - I will  not  be played like that!\\
375 - You can punish me when I get home.\\
376 - Deal.\\
377 - All right, this has gone far enough.\\
378 - Now, I will walk you to your room,\\
379 - I will roll you to your room,\\
380 - I will  race  you to your room,\\
381 - but you are too big to give bedtime rides to.\\
382 - If you say so.\\
383 - I say so.\\
384 - Now, as your father,\\
385 - I am ordering you to say, "I love you."\\
386 - I love you.\\
387 - Now say it in a convincing manner.\\
388 - I love you.\\
389 - Now say it without me telling you to.\\
390 - Is this going to take long?\\
391 - 'Cause I was going to get a soda.\\
392 - Unless I'm too  big to drink soda.\\
393 - Just go.\\
394 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
395 - These things are everywhere!\\
396 - I don't know, Malcolm.\\
397 - This seems like a very drastic escalation.\\
398 - You want to cheat, right?\\
399 - Since this is just a big cheating contest,\\
400 - I say we out-cheat everyone else.\\
401 - Why do I have to be the one who does this?\\
402 - 'Cause you look the most pathetic in a bathing suit.\\
403 - I do not! What about...?\\
404 - Yeah, okay.\\
405 - Go, Stevie.\\
406 - Uh, excu-excuse me.\\
407 - I got locked out of my room,\\
408 - and I forgot my towel and I'm very cold.\\
409 - There you go.\\
410 - Have a nice day.\\
411 - Thank you.\\
412 - I've been swimming!\\
413 - Good job. I'll be out in a minute.\\
414 - I do all the chores,\\
415 - I make all the money and I'm sorry\\
416 - if I'm a little tired when we get into the bedroom!\\
417 - That's why we took this vacation!\\
418 - We took this vacation to get away from your parents.\\
419 - You have no clue. Because you never tell me\\
420 - what you're thinking! I'm not a mind-reader!\\
421 - I got the answers.\\
422 - I'm going to go make copies.\\
423 - You guys stay here\\
424 - and keep the door open till I get back.\\
425 - Everybody... look casual.\\
426 - Now let's see you chicken out.\\
427 - What are you doing?\\
428 - It's not what it looks like.\\
429 - It looks like you're trying to break your foot\\
430 - just so you don't have to go to the dance with me.\\
431 - Ha!\\
432 - You couldn't be more wrong.\\
433 - If you don't want to go with me,\\
434 - then why don't you just break up with me?\\
435 - I really like you, Alison.\\
436 - I just didn't want to spend all that money on the dance.\\
437 - I know that was selfish, and I'm really sorry.\\
438 - But I still really want you to be my girlfriend.\\
439 - Well... thanks for being honest.\\
440 - But you made a promise to me, and I'm going to hold you to it.\\
441 - You're going to get me a corsage,\\
442 - and you're going to rent a limo,\\
443 - and you're going to pick me up at 7:00,\\
444 - and we're going to go to the dance.\\
445 - Okay.\\
446 - You'll see.\\
447 - We'll have a great time.\\
448 - We'll dance the spotlight dance,\\
449 - and we'll make sure we get our picture taken together\\
450 - so we'll always remember this night.\\
451 - And then I'll break up with you forever.\\
452 - Someone I know was a busy little team player last night.\\
453 - It just came to me what the right thing to do was.\\
454 - I've never been prouder of you than at this moment.\\
455 - We never spoke.\\
456 - Ladies and gentlemen.\\
457 - We are now ready to begin round one.\\
458 - The subject will be history.\\
459 - Question one:\\
460 - "In 1803, the French sold over 800,000 square miles..."\\
461 - Louisiana Purchase.\\
462 - Correct.\\
463 - Question two:\\
464 - "What historic document..."\\
465 - The Magna Carta.\\
466 - Correct.\\
467 - Question three: "Who..."\\
468 - Ben Franklin.\\
469 - That's... right.\\
470 - Settle down,\\
471 - please.\\
472 - Let's try this again.\\
473 - Question...\\
474 - The defenestration of Prague!\\
475 - Okay...\\
476 - The Treaty of Utrecht!\\
477 - Will all coaches join me in the back?\\
478 - You gave everyone the test, didn't you?\\
479 - In fingertip semaphore, this means...\\
480 - I know what it means!\\
481 - Good night, Dad.\\
482 - Dewey, I-I know it's just an expression,\\
483 - and I'm a mature person,\\
484 - so if you don't want to say it, you don't have to say it.\\
485 - Thanks for understanding.\\
486 - Well, I love you!\\
487 - But guess what?\\
488 - I don't love you! And you!\\
489 - And I don't love you or you or you...!\\
490 - And I especially don't love you!\\
491 - And you... love...!\\
492 - Don't try to get away!\\
493 - If you just love...\\
494 - I-I hate...\\
495 - Oh, no.\\
496 - Dad, we need more toothpaste.\\
497 - Dad?\\
498 - Dad, wake up! Get out of there!\\
499 - Dad!\\
500 - Dad!\\
501 - Get up! Get up, please!\\
502 - Don't die, Dad. I love you!\\
503 - I love you, Dad!\\
504 - Are they dead?\\
505 - Am I dead?\\
506 - Well, I-I... I passed out. I...\\
507 - How did you pull me all the way over here?\\
508 - I guess... 'cause I'm bigger.\\
509 - Oh, good.\\
510 - Thank you, son.\\
511 - You saved my life.\\
512 - I love you.\\
513 - I love you, Dad.\\
514 - Well, the results are in.\\
515 - Since everyone was so well prepared,\\
516 - everybody gets a trophy.\\
517 - Jefferson, you win first place in science.\\
518 - Quincy, you win in mathematics.\\
519 - North High, history.\\
520 - St. Bartholomew, literature.\\
521 - And Marshall in ethics.\\
522 - As you can see, it's a happy ending for all,\\
523 - so long as everybody keeps their mouths shut.\\
524 - See you next year.\\
525 - Hey, no hard feelings, okay?\\
526 - I mean, I got you, you got everybody.\\
527 - It was kind of cool.\\
528 - Right. Cool.\\
529 - I wonder what would've happened\\
530 - if we'd played it straight.\\
531 - You know, gone head-to-head for real.\\
532 - You've got to be kidding.\\
533 - Compared to you, he's a whole other species.\\
534 - You should be his pet. Come on.\\
535 - We're sorry...\\
536 - we tried to...\\
537 - make you cheat.\\
538 - You're our moral compass, Malcolm.\\
539 - We'd like to make it up to you somehow.\\
540 - Let's all pick him up\\
541 - and carry him to the bus on our shoulders.\\
542 - That's a great idea. Yeah! Yeah!\\
543 - Actually, I should sit this one out.\\
544 - With my middle ear condition...\\
545 - My scoliosis.\\
546 - I forgot my orthotics.\\
547 - Sorry. Epstein Barr.\\
548 - Yes, Mr. Cutler, we have your reservation right here.\\
549 - Hey, what time is it there in Australia?\\
550 - Canceling? Oh, no.\\
551 - Well, it's a shame to let one argument with your wife spoil...\\
552 - Sure, you can ask me whatever you want.\\
553 - Hi, honey.
\subsection {Episode 17: Clip Show #2}
1 - Ow!\\
2 - Ow!\\
3 - Finally.\\
4 - All right, you stupid, useless old man.\\
5 - There's going to be some big changes around here.\\
6 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
7 -     I don't know    \\
8 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     Life is unfair.    \\
18 - Hal.\\
19 - Wake up. It's time.\\
20 - Already?\\
21 - The baby's not due for a month.\\
22 - I told you it wasn't conceived in the elevator.\\
23 - It was Dewey's parent-teacher conference.\\
24 - Here, there's something in this one. Let's go.\\
25 - No, Hal, I'm not having the baby.\\
26 - We said we'd finish making out our will tonight.\\
27 - Tonight?\\
28 - I didn't agree to that.\\
29 - Besides, how do you know you're not having the baby?\\
30 - You're not a doctor.\\
31 - Come on. I'll meet you there.\\
32 - Hal, I have both sets of car keys.\\
33 - And I took the seat off your bike.\\
34 - Why do we have to do this\\
35 - in the middle of the night anyway?\\
36 - I will not have the boys see us writing a will.\\
37 - If they start thinking about a future without us,\\
38 - we'll totally lose control.\\
39 - I'm telling you, Lois, we are not equipped\\
40 - to deal with these issues.\\
41 - We get into a giant, stupid fight\\
42 - every time we work on the will.\\
43 - Hal, last time we tried this was ten years ago.\\
44 - And it led to a fight.\\
45 - You called me thin-skinned and overly sensitive.\\
46 - Hal, you can stall all night, but we are going to do this.\\
47 - Fine. I'll get a pencil.\\
48 - This pencil's too short.\\
49 - Hal.\\
50 - Oh, all right.\\
51 - Just remember,\\
52 - we're not doing this for ourselves.\\
53 - We're doing this for the children.\\
54 - What if there was a terrible accident and we had no plan?\\
55 - Our poor boys would be alone and defenseless.\\
56 - And I guess you kids\\
57 - really didn't do any major harm,\\
58 - so I've decided to let you off...\\
59 - Okay, tangible assets.\\
60 - How do we expect to find anything?\\
61 - We just shove stuff in boxes.\\
62 - Look, there's a fortune cookie in here.\\
63 - Wait, here's something we already did.\\
64 - This'll save time.\\
65 - We already decided Malcolm\\
66 - gets the coin collection.\\
67 - Great. What coin collection?\\
68 - You remember that proof set we had hidden in the closet?\\
69 - The one that Dewey found and swallowed...\\
70 - Oh, yeah, that was 500 bucks down the drain.\\
71 - And not one dime in the strainer.\\
72 - Whatever happened to the silver tea set?\\
73 - The boys pounded it into a suit of armor.\\
74 - Wedding china, antique stemware, hand-blown crystal butterflies.\\
75 - Why did we even buy those?\\
76 - Hal, we have fewer assets today than we did ten years ago.\\
77 - We can't be this broke.\\
78 - We just can't be.\\
79 - Where are the bank statements?\\
80 - Right here.\\
81 - Checks and everything,\\
82 - but you are not going to find anything helpful.\\
83 - By the way, I would like it noted\\
84 - that I tried to avoid this whole evening\\
85 - because I knew this would happen.\\
86 - Maybe in the future, you'll trust my judgment.\\
87 - You spent $300 on sequins?\\
88 -     And bad mistakes    \\
89 -     I've made a few    \\
90 -     I've had my share of sand kicked in my face    \\
91 -     But I've come through    \\
92 -      And we mean to go on and on and on and on     \\
93 -     We are the champions, my friends    \\
94 -     And we'll keep on fighting till the end    \\
95 -     We are the champions, we are the champ...    \\
96 - That was for the car.\\
97 - And what about this?\\
98 - $520 to the hospital for toy extraction?\\
99 - Live, live, die.\\
100 - Live,\\
101 - live, live, live, die.\\
102 - You know, son,\\
103 - maybe you've been spending too much...\\
104 - Silence.\\
105 - Seize him.\\
106 - All right, son,\\
107 - I think it's time you goose-stepped off to bed.\\
108 - Dad, you're embarrassing me in front of my men.\\
109 - Hal!\\
110 - Why is this still here?\\
111 - Ow.\\
112 - Oh, my God.\\
113 - Do you realize how much money we spent\\
114 - sending Francis to military school?\\
115 - That one we couldn't avoid.\\
116 - He needed the discipline.\\
117 - No! No, no!\\
118 - Now we are going to do this until you get it right.\\
119 - All right, now once more.\\
120 - With feeling.\\
121 - And...\\
122 -     Candyman...    \\
123 -     Hey, Candyman    \\
124 -     Who can take a sunrise...    \\
125 -      Who can take a sunrise...     \\
126 -     Sprinkle it with dew    \\
127 -      Ooh-ooh-ooh     \\
128 -     Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two?    \\
129 -     Candyman...    \\
130 -      Candyma-an     \\
131 -     The Candyman can...    \\
132 -      The Candyman can     \\
133 -     The Candyman can 'cause he mixes it with love    \\
134 -     And makes the world taste good    \\
135 -      Oh-oh-oh     \\
136 -     The Candyman makes everything he bakes    \\
137 -     Satisfying and delicious          Do-do-do-do     \\
138 -     Talk about your childhood wishes    \\
139 -     You can even eat the dishes.    \\
140 - Why would a bank let us\\
141 - keep an account this messed up?\\
142 - There are checks out of sequence...\\
143 - Look, a check from next year.\\
144 - And this is two different checks taped together.\\
145 - What difference does it make, Lois?\\
146 - You know better than anybody.\\
147 - We are in the crapper.\\
148 - You sound like you're blaming me.\\
149 - Oh, you're blaming me?\\
150 - We both agreed that you would be in charge of the finances.\\
151 - This may be part of the problem.\\
152 - Okay, let's forget about the finances.\\
153 - "Property transfer to the surviving spouse."\\
154 - We can do this.\\
155 - I think that whoever goes first, the other one\\
156 - is going to want to stay\\
157 - in the house with the kids until...\\
158 - What?\\
159 - Nothing.\\
160 - Why are you looking at me like that?\\
161 - No, I'm just, you know...\\
162 - just I've always known that...\\
163 - you'll die first.\\
164 - What?\\
165 - And then I'll commit suicide a few days later.\\
166 - I don't want to live without you, Lois.\\
167 - What?! Oh, don't act so surprised.\\
168 - We both know what I'm talking about.\\
169 - No, I...\\
170 - You're wishing me dead?\\
171 - Why would you say such a thing?\\
172 - Oh, and there is no reaction at all to my suicide.\\
173 - Oh, that's a real eye-opener.\\
174 - What makes you think that I am going to die first?\\
175 - Honey, you just have that kind of personality.\\
176 - You operate at a very high level of stress.\\
177 - Are you aborigines?!\\
178 - I have had it!\\
179 - Fire? Fire?!\\
180 - Whose damn dog is this?!\\
181 - I said whose damn dog is this?!\\
182 - This is the property line!\\
183 - The property line! The property line!\\
184 - You can't cross the property line!\\
185 - Come out here and apologize to me like an adult!\\
186 - Oh, that's real mature.\\
187 - I can't believe that you are wishing me dead\\
188 - and insulting my personality.\\
189 - Calm down, Lois.\\
190 - I am just pointing out\\
191 - that I am the far more relaxed person.\\
192 - Get in the car and go.\\
193 - Shut up!\\
194 - I just don't let the stress get to me.\\
195 - I haven't had any special training; it's just my way.\\
196 - You are going to pay for this.\\
197 - Oh, see, that kind of comment doesn't help anyone.\\
198 - I'm sorry, I only just learned that I am a human time bomb.\\
199 - And you're not the least bit curious\\
200 - about how I'm going to do it?\\
201 - Oh, you are not going to kill yourself.\\
202 - You can't even rip off your own Band-Aids.\\
203 - I happen to be very hairy, but this is different.\\
204 - I have thought this through.\\
205 - It is going to be beautiful and romantic\\
206 - and it's going to make everyone forget about your stupid funeral.\\
207 - Shh! The boys.\\
208 - Ow!\\
209 - Shh! You can't handle that.\\
210 - How are you going to kill yourself?\\
211 - You startled me!\\
212 - Ow! Stop it.\\
213 - Shh.\\
214 - Ow!\\
215 - Shh! How you like that?\\
216 - Ow!\\
217 - Shh! Ow!\\
218 - Shh! Ow!\\
219 - Ow! Shh!\\
220 - Ow! Shh!\\
221 - Okay.\\
222 - I think we both have a lot to apologize for.\\
223 - I am sorry for pulling your hair.\\
224 - I'm not proud of the Dutch rub...\\
225 - or the ear twisting.\\
226 - See? We're back on the path to adulthood.\\
227 - Let's get to work. I agree.\\
228 - Let's stop and go to bed.\\
229 - Hal, sit down.\\
230 - We're past the worst of it.\\
231 - Okay. In the event\\
232 - of death of  both  parents,\\
233 - who do we want to appoint as a guardian?\\
234 - My family's out.\\
235 - Well, they're not going to my family.\\
236 - Hello.\\
237 - Ow!\\
238 - Ow!\\
239 - Ow!\\
240 - Grandma.\\
241 - Ooh, geez.\\
242 - Shouldn't we have more choices?\\
243 - Doesn't it seem if we die,\\
244 - there should be more people willing\\
245 - to give our kids a home?\\
246 - You want to see a strike?\\
247 - Malcolm, what are you doing?\\
248 - Look at me.\\
249 - I'm the world's greatest bowler.\\
250 - I care so much about bowling.\\
251 - Bowling is so important.\\
252 - Malcolm, come back here.\\
253 - You want a strike, I'll give you a strike.\\
254 - Here's your damn strike.\\
255 - Where is he going?\\
256 -     The faster we're falling    \\
257 -     We're stopping, stalling    \\
258 -     We're running in circles again    \\
259 -     Just as things were looking up    \\
260 -     You said it wasn't good enough    \\
261 -     But still we're trying one more time    \\
262 -     Maybe we're just trying too hard    \\
263 -     When really it's closer than it is too far...    \\
264 - Wow. Nice.\\
265 - It was.\\
266 -     'Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep    \\
267 -     Up above in my head, instead of going under...    \\
268 - Reese, that was amazing.\\
269 - Listen, when the kids at school ask you about this...\\
270 - ...tell them I got under your bra.\\
271 - Give 'em a reason.\\
272 - The suspect appears to be resisting.\\
273 - Oh. It looks like\\
274 - they're taking out the pepper spray.\\
275 -     Can you hear the drums, Fernando?    \\
276 -     I remember long ago another starry night like this    \\
277 -     In the firelight, Fernando    \\
278 -     You were humming to yourself    \\
279 -     And softly strumming your guitar    \\
280 -     I could hear the distant drums    \\
281 -     And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar    \\
282 -     There was something in the air that night    \\
283 -     The stars were bright, Fernando    \\
284 -     They were shining there for you and me    \\
285 -     For liberty, Fernando    \\
286 -     Though we never thought that we could lose    \\
287 -     There's no regret    \\
288 -     If I had to do the same again    \\
289 -     I would, my friend...    \\
290 - Well, there's one bright spot in all of this.\\
291 - We finally agree on something.\\
292 - There's no one to take care of our kids.\\
293 - You're not going to even mention Francis?\\
294 - Let's go to bed.\\
295 - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\\
296 - Why won't you even consider it?\\
297 - Hal, this is hard enough\\
298 - without you getting us sidetracked.\\
299 - This isn't about Francis.\\
300 - This is about our children.\\
301 - You know what I mean.\\
302 - Why is Francis such a bad idea?\\
303 - He's working, he's married.\\
304 - He's showing responsibility.\\
305 - Look, I will be the first\\
306 - to admit that Francis was not the easiest kid\\
307 - for you to deal with, but he has changed.\\
308 - Oh, yeah. Big change.\\
309 - He quit school, moved 3,000 miles,\\
310 - and married someone that he knew for exactly 20 minutes.\\
311 - You can't make life decisions\\
312 - on a whim and be a good parent.\\
313 - A good parent understands that actions have consequences.\\
314 - Lois, we are parents precisely because we can't remember that.\\
315 - You have never been able to give him credit\\
316 - for anything good he does.\\
317 - Good he does? Like what?\\
318 - Like...\\
319 - Look, I am not a performing seal, Lois.\\
320 - I can't just bark out a list of good deeds\\
321 - while you take a bow and throw me a mackerel\\
322 - out of your fanny pack.\\
323 - I can't talk to you when you're hysterical.\\
324 - No, no, no. You can't get out of this\\
325 - by playing the "my husband is crazy" card.\\
326 - It didn't work with the airport security screener,\\
327 - and it is not going to work now.\\
328 - I am  stunned  that you are even thinking\\
329 - of having him take care of the boys.\\
330 - He's the worst-behaved of all of them.\\
331 - I love you  so  much.\\
332 - Why don't you just admit it, Lois?\\
333 - You have never liked Francis.\\
334 - Is it any surprise\\
335 - why he's been such a mess growing up?\\
336 - You can't blame the way Francis is on me.\\
337 - You-you  honestly  don't see your part in all of this?\\
338 - Parents' weekend at the military school.\\
339 - You two got into a sword fight.\\
340 - You dragged him\\
341 - off the field in the middle of a tee-ball game\\
342 - because you thought he gave you a look.\\
343 - His first words were, "You  shut up."\\
344 - Lois, you two have been at each other's throats\\
345 - since the day he was born.\\
346 - He started it. What?\\
347 - Nothing. No, no.\\
348 - You said he started it. What does that mean?\\
349 - Just leave me alone.\\
350 - How the hell can a baby start anything?\\
351 - I don't know, Hal.\\
352 - It's just,\\
353 - everything started so badly\\
354 - right after he was born.\\
355 - What, the staph infection?\\
356 - What does that have to do with anything?\\
357 - I was stuck in a hospital without my baby.\\
358 - Completely isolated.\\
359 - For six weeks\\
360 - all I could do was lie there and-and worry about him\\
361 - and think about how much he needed me to nurse him\\
362 - and to... and to hold him.\\
363 - And when they finally\\
364 - let me out, I run home as fast as I can\\
365 - to take care of poor little Francis,\\
366 - and when I get there, I discover... he's happy.\\
367 - He couldn't have cared less\\
368 - I was gone all that time.\\
369 - You were taking care of him.\\
370 - He was happy as a clam.\\
371 - I was just an intrusion.\\
372 - Honey, I had no idea...\\
373 - I know it's wrong\\
374 - and I know it's creepy\\
375 - and I can't help it.\\
376 - I'm the worst mother of all time.\\
377 - It's just as much my fault.\\
378 - We've just never gotten this right.\\
379 - We are utter failures as parents.\\
380 - I mean, look at this pigsty.\\
381 - Look at how we live.\\
382 - Why are we bothering even making a will?\\
383 - All we can leave our children is misery.\\
384 - We are a walking advertisement for forced sterilization.\\
385 - Who are the idiots in Washington that allowed us procreate?\\
386 - I mean, this family is an unmitigated disaster.\\
387 - Oh!\\
388 - Aah!... Oh!\\
389 - Ow! Ow!\\
390 - Oh!\\
391 - Eat chalk, evildoer!\\
392 - Ow!\\
393 - I hit my head!\\
394 - Ow!\\
395 - Shh.\\
396 - Honey, honey, calm down.\\
397 - Let me have a look.\\
398 - It really hurts.\\
399 - It's bleeding, isn't it?\\
400 - I know it's bleeding.\\
401 - Dewey, what's 19 times five?\\
402 - I'm in... What?\\
403 - 19 times five. Try to figure it out.\\
404 - Yeah. Well...\\
405 - Ten times five is 50, so... County or St. John's?\\
406 - St. John's. Pediatric emergency opened again.\\
407 - Okay, Dewey, everything's going to be fine.\\
408 - Yeah, for Dr. Flannery. Please tell him\\
409 - my son Dewey got a bad bump on his head.\\
410 - My husband will meet him at St. John's.\\
411 - They'll be there in ten minutes.\\
412 - Okay, sport. Field trip.\\
413 - Can I have a box of apple juice?\\
414 - Oh, all we have is apple-cherry.\\
415 - Of course that's all we have.\\
416 - We're the worst parents in the world.\\
417 - Oh, I'm sorry. Did you just call my wife "wide ride"?\\
418 - I get it. You got to make a big show for...\\
419 - Now, you are going\\
420 - to get up and apologize...\\
421 - All right, fight.\\
422 - Get him, Dad! Come on.\\
423 - Come on, work the gut.\\
424 - Hold this.\\
425 -     All my life was a paper    \\
426 -     Once plain, pure and white    \\
427 -     Till you moved with your pen    \\
428 -     Changing moods now and then till the balance was right    \\
429 -     And you decorated my life    \\
430 -     By painting your love    \\
431 -     All over my heart    \\
432 -     You decorated my life    \\
433 -      Ooh, ooh     \\
434 -      Ooh, ooh.     
\subsection {Episode 18: Reese's Party}
1 - Hal, I'm leaving a sandwich here for you. Thanks, honey.\\
2 - Wow.\\
3 - That was quick.\\
4 - You must have been really hungry.\\
5 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
6 -     I don't know    \\
7 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     And you're not so big    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     Life is unfair.    \\
17 - Come on, boys, breakfast! Let's go!\\
18 - You're going to be late! Hal, look what you're doing.\\
19 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
20 - My last good tie.\\
21 - No. I just bought you a whole 12-pack.\\
22 - Well, I went through it!\\
23 - Mom!\\
24 - Oh, for the love of Pete!\\
25 - Reese blew his nose on my shirt!\\
26 - Because Dewey put his dirty underwear on my pillow!\\
27 - And one of them used\\
28 - my graphing calculator to smash open a juice box!\\
29 - Everybody just shut up!\\
30 - Your mother is nine months pregnant.\\
31 - She's stressed out enough as it is!\\
32 - She doesn't need all this screaming!\\
33 - All right, you know what?\\
34 - I know how to solve this.\\
35 - We're only going to be gone for two days.\\
36 - We're going to have at least one weekend\\
37 - before this baby's born where we get some peace and quiet.\\
38 - Without us?\\
39 - You know the plan?\\
40 - As soon as you leave,\\
41 - I put Reese on a bus\\
42 - to his grandma in Canada.\\
43 - After school, I take Malcolm over to Stevie's.\\
44 - And Dewey stays with me.\\
45 - Looks like you're the lucky winner.\\
46 - Why are you splitting us up?\\
47 - Because this is the only way\\
48 - the judge would let us leave town.\\
49 - Have fun in school today, suckers.\\
50 - I'll send you\\
51 - a postcard from Whitehorse.\\
52 - Reese, figure it out.\\
53 - It takes 26 hours to get there and 26 hours back.\\
54 - Your backpack is full of food, and no one ever called Grandma.\\
55 - Wait a minute.\\
56 - I'm spending the entire weekend on this bus?\\
57 - I'm so glad we're finally here.\\
58 - I can't believe you made me walk that extra 150 yards.\\
59 - Trust me, valet parking--\\
60 - even complimentary valet parking-- is a scam.\\
61 - Welcome to Lovebirds, a couples resort.\\
62 - Wow.\\
63 - Hi. We have a reservation.\\
64 - Could we get to our room quickly?\\
65 - I really have to use the bathroom.\\
66 - Again.\\
67 - I'm sorry, but the room\\
68 - we were holding for you\\
69 - is no longer available.\\
70 - You gave away our room?\\
71 - I'm sorry, sir. You were four hours late,\\
72 - and you didn't call.\\
73 - But it's my wife.\\
74 - We have to stop every ten miles\\
75 - because she has to pee all the time.\\
76 - I do not have to pee all the time.\\
77 - Don't worry. I think we can find you something.\\
78 - I don't know if you've read our brochures,\\
79 - but this is sort of a romantic hideaway for couples.\\
80 - We know what it is.\\
81 - Let me see what I can do.\\
82 - I have to get off my feet.\\
83 - Angela...\\
84 - Yes, Warren? Yes?\\
85 - I am so sorry.\\
86 - I just had to sit down.\\
87 - Don't... don't mind me.\\
88 - You mind if we turn off that fireplace?\\
89 - I'm sweating like a pig.\\
90 - Well, little man, you and I have quite\\
91 - the fun-filled weekend ahead of us.\\
92 - Tomorrow morning, there's jazz at the Farmer's Market.\\
93 - Then Lifetime is having an intimate portrait\\
94 - of Sandy Bullock.\\
95 - And tomorrow night, there's Improv in the Park\\
96 - with a political bent.\\
97 - Sound fun?\\
98 - I think I just want to play.\\
99 - Play? Well, sure,\\
100 - we could squeeze in some play, I guess.\\
101 - Why don't you go ahead and get that started?\\
102 - No, I mean play together. What do you mean?\\
103 - We can play fort.\\
104 - Ooh, I don't have Fort.\\
105 - I have Clue,\\
106 - but it's a collector's edition, unopened.\\
107 - If you want, I can show you a picture of it.\\
108 - No. You don't have to have  fort. You just do it.\\
109 - Didn't you ever play fort with your friends\\
110 - when you were a kid?\\
111 - Of course I played.\\
112 - I had friends, plenty of friends.\\
113 - And you're short.\\
114 - Come on. I'll show you.\\
115 - Hello, ma'am.\\
116 - This is Mel Jenkins with Transway Bus Lines.\\
117 - I don't know how to tell you this.\\
118 - I was keeping an eye on your son for you, like you asked,\\
119 - but when we got out on the interstate,\\
120 - he went into the bathroom, and...\\
121 - Well, he must have jumped out the window while we were moving.\\
122 - I'd gone 60 miles before I noticed.\\
123 - What?!\\
124 - How could you do this to my favorite son?\\
125 - The only one I ever loved\\
126 - is now lying\\
127 - in a ditch somewhere.\\
128 - Well, I'd better call the coffin store.\\
129 - Good-bye.\\
130 - I knew it!\\
131 - I knew if I came back I'd catch you here.\\
132 - You can't be trusted for five seconds,\\
133 - let alone a whole weekend.\\
134 - Okay, look, just don't tell...\\
135 - Wait a minute.\\
136 - What are  you  doing here?\\
137 - Me? I'm here to...\\
138 - guard the house from your bad things you're doing.\\
139 - What's in the bag?\\
140 - Candles...\\
141 - chocolate-covered strawberries...\\
142 - Sleepless in Seattle.\\
143 - My God, you're gay.\\
144 - No, I'm not.\\
145 - Look, I don't know how I did it,\\
146 - but I talked Kathy McCulskey into coming over tonight.\\
147 - Kathy McCulskey?\\
148 - I'm impressed.\\
149 - She doesn't leave her house\\
150 - for anything less than second base.\\
151 - Which is exactly why we need the house to ourselves.\\
152 - I'm sorry, Malcolm. I'm already committed to this party.\\
153 - Reese, you've seen enough teenage movies\\
154 - to know how badly this is going to turn out.\\
155 - I haven't just seen them, I've studied them.\\
156 - And I found the fatal flaw.\\
157 - In every one of those movies,\\
158 - the party was on a Saturday night.\\
159 - Mine? Friday.\\
160 - This gives me an extra day\\
161 - to refill the pool, replace the crystal thing,\\
162 - turn back the odometer,\\
163 - and get the dead bodies back in the ground.\\
164 - Please don't do this to me.\\
165 - Tell you what, Malcolm.\\
166 - I'll try and keep the front room closet\\
167 - off limits as long as I can.\\
168 - I thought we reserved a deluxe suite.\\
169 - No, ma'am.\\
170 - This is the Petite Sleeper.\\
171 - Thank you. Thank you very much.\\
172 - Why do they bother giving you a confirmation number\\
173 - if they're just going to give your room away anyway?\\
174 - Don't be mad at them.\\
175 - It's not their fault.\\
176 - Oh, yeah, so it's my fault.\\
177 - I didn't say that.\\
178 - Well, at least we have a great view\\
179 - of the parking lot from here.\\
180 - At home, I have to crane my neck to see our car.\\
181 - Look, you know what?\\
182 - The room is what it is.\\
183 - So we just have to try to make the best of it.\\
184 - We're here. We have a little time to ourselves.\\
185 - Let's find a way to enjoy it, hmm?\\
186 - I have to pee.\\
187 - Of course you do.\\
188 - Oh, perfect.\\
189 - They promised us a heart-shaped tub.\\
190 - We got a tub-shaped tub.\\
191 - For the love of God, will you take a break?\\
192 - I know you're pregnant.\\
193 - I know you're uncomfortable.\\
194 - I know you're swollen and puffy and distended\\
195 - and inflated, but you've just got to stop complaining.\\
196 - Well, I'm sorry I'm such a burden.\\
197 - In another three weeks,\\
198 - you won't ever have to suffer through this again.\\
199 - Well, we don't know that.\\
200 - What did you say?\\
201 - I said,\\
202 - I'd move the car.\\
203 - No, you said,\\
204 - we don't know that, but, Hal...\\
205 - Hal, we do know that,\\
206 - because you had a vasectomy.\\
207 - Yes, I did.\\
208 - Oh, my God, you didn't do it!\\
209 - You lied to me.\\
210 - Just a little.\\
211 - Hal, you sat with an ice pack\\
212 - on your crotch for three days.\\
213 - Well, that should count for something.\\
214 - Hal, we talked about this.\\
215 - We agreed on this.\\
216 - No,  you  agreed on it!\\
217 - I never wanted a vasectomy.\\
218 - There are plenty of other methods out there.\\
219 - Oh, yeah, they work.\\
220 - We've got our rhythm method child,\\
221 - our diaphragm child, our condom child.\\
222 - Oh, yes, and our two abstinence children.\\
223 - Lois, you just don't understand\\
224 - how extraordinarily precious those parts are to me.\\
225 - Precious?! Hal, give me a break.\\
226 - You're not that guy.\\
227 - You've never been that guy.\\
228 - When it comes to this, every guy is that guy.\\
229 - C-4.\\
230 - Hit.\\
231 - E-4.\\
232 - Hit.\\
233 - Hey, you guys want to come\\
234 - to a party at my house?\\
235 - It's going to be amazing.\\
236 - My parents are gone for the whole weekend.\\
237 - The whole weekend?\\
238 - You heard me.\\
239 - 48 hours, totally unsupervised.\\
240 - Anything goes.\\
241 - Total freedom, man.\\
242 - Interesting.\\
243 - This'll do.\\
244 - What's this junk?\\
245 - What is going on?\\
246 - Okay, here's what's going to happen.\\
247 - We have some private business to conduct.\\
248 - This is now our garage\\
249 - for the next 48 hours.\\
250 - You don't come near it. You don't ask about it.\\
251 - We get out before your parents come back.\\
252 - They never have to find out\\
253 - that you're the one who invited us.\\
254 - What the hell are you guys doing?\\
255 - You know, he just\\
256 - explained it really well,\\
257 - but all I could hear was my own heartbeat.\\
258 - Reese, that stuff is...\\
259 - See, that's you guys talking,\\
260 - and that doesn't work for me.\\
261 - Now, can I trust that you guys\\
262 - won't talk, or am I going\\
263 - to have to remove something\\
264 - to make it physically impossible?\\
265 - And that is not the worst part\\
266 - of the operation.\\
267 - Once they split open your coin purse,\\
268 - they pull out the vas deferens,\\
269 - put it on the table and... chop!\\
270 - And they don't always get it\\
271 - on the first chop, either.\\
272 - Chop, chop, chop!\\
273 - Can I get you guys another drink?\\
274 - Set us up, will you?\\
275 - It's been three hours\\
276 - since these guys took over our house.\\
277 - So far, there's been a few fires,\\
278 - I've had a bottle thrown at me\\
279 - and I've even been threatened with death.\\
280 - On the other hand,\\
281 - they haven't stopped raving about Reese's bean dip.\\
282 - So the evening could go either way.\\
283 - Did Fast Eddie like his salmon?\\
284 - In about an hour I'm gonna need\\
285 - you guys to dump a 50-gallon drum of...\\
286 - stuff. Do it quick,\\
287 - don't draw attention to yourselves,\\
288 - and don't breathe in when you're doing it.\\
289 - Look, it's one thing to ask us\\
290 - to stay out of your business,\\
291 - but when you try to involve us...\\
292 - Okay.\\
293 - Hey, Donnie, the souffl  s are almost up.\\
294 - Hmm.\\
295 - Who the hell is that?\\
296 - I don't know. It's... Oh, no.\\
297 - Who ordered the girl?\\
298 - Not me. I didn't do it.\\
299 - Kathy, hi.\\
300 - Hey.\\
301 - You didn't tell me there were going to be other guys here.\\
302 - Yeah, well... Just 'cause you read something\\
303 - on a bathroom wall doesn't mean it's true.\\
304 - No. Look, these are cousins of mine.\\
305 - You know, friend cousins.\\
306 - They dropped in unexpectedly.\\
307 - So, you know, right now isn't a good time.\\
308 - Obviously not.\\
309 - We could still do the dinner and talking part.\\
310 - God.\\
311 - Yeah, man, show some class.\\
312 - Thank you.\\
313 - Kathy, listen, you have to trust me on this one.\\
314 - Hey, bring your girlfriend in here.\\
315 - Yeah.\\
316 -        \\
317 - ...98, 99, 100.\\
318 - Ready or not, here I come.\\
319 - There you are.\\
320 - What's wrong?\\
321 - No one ever found me before.\\
322 - It's because you're such a good hider.\\
323 - Yeah, that's probably it.\\
324 - Just put it anywhere.\\
325 - We had a hard time finding this old girl.\\
326 - You can imagine we don't get much call for it,\\
327 - this being a couples resort and all.\\
328 - Uh-huh.\\
329 - Not sure I even know\\
330 - how to operate the dang thing.\\
331 - I'm sure you'll figure it out.\\
332 - My gosh, I've been here for over 30 years\\
333 - and I ain't never done this before.\\
334 - We see all kind of couples here,\\
335 - but I've never seen...\\
336 - Thank you. I'll finish this.\\
337 - Fine by me.\\
338 - I've got to go up to Room 318\\
339 - and fill the bathtub with rose petals.\\
340 - Arm. Five points for Chuck.\\
341 - Oh! Crotch again.\\
342 - 15 points. Nice shot, Randy.\\
343 - Chuck, Randy, we got to put in the catalyst.\\
344 - Okay, we can finish this game later.\\
345 - Don't sit down, Chuck.\\
346 - You're still in this.\\
347 - I think it's a party again.\\
348 - Are you kidding me?\\
349 - This is a hostage situation. No.\\
350 - Reese, haven't you ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome?\\
351 - You're starting to identify with your captors.\\
352 - What captors?\\
353 - These guys saved my life, man.\\
354 - Because they decided not to kill you.\\
355 - Same thing.\\
356 - They made us accessories to some kind of felony.\\
357 - They're setting up a decontamination shower\\
358 - in front of the garage.\\
359 - And poor Kathy must have been completely traumatized.\\
360 - Where'd she go anyway?\\
361 - I'm never going to forgive myself\\
362 - for dragging her into this.\\
363 - We have to do something.\\
364 - You've got to relax, Malcolm.\\
365 - Some of these guys are really nice.\\
366 - Have you had Big Wanda tell you your fortune?\\
367 - Look, we can't handle this ourselves.\\
368 - We don't know how to deal\\
369 - with a whole bunch of low-life criminals.\\
370 - We need help.\\
371 - You guys did the right thing by calling me.\\
372 - Sorry to drag you out here all the way from the ranch.\\
373 - This shouldn't take long.\\
374 - They all in there?\\
375 - Yeah, well, one of them's\\
376 - in the bedroom with Kathy.\\
377 - Who's Kathy?\\
378 - My date.\\
379 - Dude.\\
380 - What are you going to do?\\
381 - How are you going to get them out?\\
382 - Whoa, whoa, slow down.\\
383 - You got to think these things through.\\
384 - We're going to handle this real delicately.\\
385 - When you're dealing with a complex\\
386 - psychological situation, you have to remember\\
387 - there's a lot of subtle machinations\\
388 - that come into play.\\
389 - Donnie?\\
390 - Francis? What are you  doing here?\\
391 - I heard you were in Alaska.\\
392 - No, I'm working\\
393 - at a ranch now. How you doing?\\
394 - You still hanging out at Kelsey's?\\
395 - No. They went karaoke.\\
396 - Oh, this town.\\
397 - So listen, this is my parents' house.\\
398 - These are my brothers.\\
399 - I know you didn't know that,\\
400 - but when you and your buddies took over the place,\\
401 - you kind of freaked them out a little bit.\\
402 - Oh.\\
403 - So, maybe you want to take this someplace else.\\
404 - Yeah, you know what?\\
405 - That just sounds like it's going to be hard, so... no.\\
406 - Hey, look, dude I know you don't want me\\
407 - to get the cops over here, do you?\\
408 - And I'm sure you wouldn't want me\\
409 - to tell them who pulled over the water tower.\\
410 - That was you, Francis.\\
411 - Really?\\
412 - Well, then maybe I should tell them\\
413 - about the highway overpass.\\
414 - That was also you.\\
415 - Car wash? The sinkhole?\\
416 - All you.\\
417 - Huh.\\
418 - Um, okay, well, you guys sit tight\\
419 - and we'll be in the house.\\
420 - If that's okay.\\
421 - Well, I think we gave 'em enough to think about.\\
422 - Hal.\\
423 - I thought I saw a spider.\\
424 - You want to just cut our losses and check out in the morning?\\
425 - I guess.\\
426 - Should we still do the Afterglow Breakfast?\\
427 - Well... we gotta eat.\\
428 - Are you sure I'm not too old for Winky Dinks?\\
429 - The box says "For ages eight and up."\\
430 - Well, I'm right smack-dab\\
431 - in the middle of that window.\\
432 - What the hell is this?\\
433 - Shh.\\
434 - We just got them to go to sleep.\\
435 - You boys aren't even supposed to be here\\
436 - and you're throwing\\
437 - a coed slumber party?\\
438 - Who's the fat chick?\\
439 - Okay, that's it. I want everybody out of here! Pronto!\\
440 - Hey! No one tells us  what to do. That's right.\\
441 - Craig, you might want...\\
442 - None of your excuses!\\
443 - You and your little friends\\
444 - are in a boatload of trouble.\\
445 - Let's just go back to Craig's apartment\\
446 - and wait it out till Sunday.\\
447 - We can't just leave him here!\\
448 - Dewey, there's a principle I learned in military school.\\
449 - The needs of the many outweigh the needs\\
450 - of the guy who can't run fast.\\
451 - No! We face-painted each other.\\
452 - I'm not leaving him here.\\
453 - Dewey, there's nothing we can do.\\
454 - Not the crevice tool!\\
455 - I know what to do.\\
456 - Seven minutes till checkout.\\
457 - Do you have the soap, the sewing kit\\
458 - and the stationery?\\
459 - Got 'em. I also got the shampoos\\
460 - and the shoe cloth.\\
461 - I couldn't find the shower caps.\\
462 - I got 'em. Good.\\
463 - Are you coming?\\
464 - No. This is ridiculous.\\
465 - We came all this way\\
466 - to have one relaxing, romantic weekend\\
467 - and, and we're more tense than when we left the house.\\
468 - Well, there's nothing we can do about it now.\\
469 - Yes, there is.\\
470 - We've got seven minutes left.\\
471 - We paid for it. We're going to use it.\\
472 - How?\\
473 - By doing one nice thing for each other before we go.\\
474 - And we'd better make it good,\\
475 - because we're not going\\
476 - to have another chance at it for 18 years.\\
477 - Well... I suppose I could be persuaded to make a gesture.\\
478 - Will you rub my feet?\\
479 - I would love to rub your feet.\\
480 - What can I do for you?\\
481 - Please leave my balls alone.\\
482 - Okay.\\
483 - Mmm...\\
484 - Sir? Ma'am?\\
485 - Checkout was two hours ago, and we really do need the room.\\
486 - Hello?!\\
487 - What the hell do you think you're doing?\\
488 - I think it would be best if you left...  now.\\
489 - That's what you think, huh?\\
490 - Yeah, that's what I think.\\
491 - Well, I think we're going to take a pass on that.\\
492 - Okay, Donnie.\\
493 - Just remember, you drove me to this.\\
494 - Really? What exactly did we just drive you to?\\
495 - I told.\\
496 - Oh, you  told.\\
497 - I called your moms and I told on you.\\
498 - You called my mommy, hmm?\\
499 - Donnie?!\\
500 - Mom?\\
501 - What-what are you doing here?\\
502 - Trying to hide how ashamed I am at your behavior\\
503 - and wondering where I went wrong.\\
504 - Ma, come on.\\
505 - Your father and I tried to give you\\
506 - the best life possible,\\
507 - and this is how we're paid back?\\
508 - Ma, you don't own me.\\
509 - I make my own decisions now.\\
510 - These  are the decisions you make?\\
511 - This  is the life you choose?!\\
512 - Who's covering your shift\\
513 - at the suit outlet?\\
514 - Dude...\\
515 - you are  so  busted.\\
516 - Don't you be so smug,\\
517 - David Alan Ferguson.\\
518 - Believe me, every one of your stepfathers\\
519 - is going to hear about this.\\
520 - You say good-bye to your friends\\
521 - and you get in the car... right now!\\
522 - Yeah, see you later. Uh, bye.\\
523 - I forgot how good it feels to tell.\\
524 - Yeah, everything was fine.\\
525 - You know,\\
526 - kind of boring.\\
527 - Quiet, boring.\\
528 - Fun, but boring.\\
529 - Look who I picked up from the bus station\\
530 - after not having seen him\\
531 - since I dropped him off.\\
532 - Canada was wonderful.\\
533 - I brought bananas back for everybody.\\
534 - Do you really want to know?\\
535 - Not really. No.
\subsection {Episode 19: Future Malcolm}
1 - How many more for the record?\\
2 - Two more tubs should do it.\\
3 - There really isn't a category for eating jalapenos,\\
4 - but I think he's probably suffered enough.\\
5 - I'm going to tell him in a minute.\\
6 - I'm so close to telling him, honest.\\
7 - Ninty-seven...\\
8 - Really, I'm going to tell him.\\
9 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
10 -     I don't know    \\
11 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     Life is unfair.    \\
21 - Mom, Dad, can we drive out to the country this Saturday\\
22 - to see the meteor shower?\\
23 - We only have to go, like, 25 miles to get a good view.\\
24 - It starts around 2:00 a.m.\\
25 - How's that again, son?\\
26 - The meteor shower.\\
27 - They say it's going\\
28 - to be the best one in a hundred years.\\
29 - Sounds science-y.\\
30 - No, thanks.\\
31 - Come on, Reese, a meteor shower.\\
32 - Fireballs zooming around the air,\\
33 - smashing into the ground right in front of you.\\
34 - That's not what happens.\\
35 - Can we ride one?\\
36 - No! It's 60 miles up,\\
37 - but it's beautiful and interesting anyway!\\
38 - Look, if Malcolm needs to do this for some school assignment,\\
39 - then we're going to do it.\\
40 - It's not for school.\\
41 - Then forget it.\\
42 - We're not getting up at 2:00 a.m.\\
43 - just to look at stars.\\
44 - Bran cereal?\\
45 - Why are you eating that stuff?\\
46 - You said it tastes like kitty litter.\\
47 - I'm eating it because I have to stop\\
48 - gaining weight.\\
49 - I've turned into a gigantic, fat cow.\\
50 - Oh, you have not.\\
51 - Even the doctor said so.\\
52 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
53 - You're eating for two now.\\
54 - What kind of doctor doesn't know that?\\
55 - Hal, he's right.\\
56 - I'm huge!\\
57 - And I don't understand how it's happening.\\
58 - Well, I think you're beautiful no matter what.\\
59 - Oh, thank you, honey. You're so sweet.\\
60 - Oh...\\
61 - Anything I want to do, they don't understand.\\
62 - And if they do understand, they just make fun of it.\\
63 - But why should I expect them to be any different\\
64 - than the rest of the world?\\
65 - Let's face it-- everyone on this planet\\
66 - is a brain-dead, butt-scratching half-wit.\\
67 - Bite... us.\\
68 - How could you possibly think that the Nimzovich defense\\
69 - would work against me?\\
70 - You tried it two games ago,\\
71 - and I slaughtered you.\\
72 - You tried it four games ago, and I slaughtered you.\\
73 - Seriously, how do you find your way home at night?\\
74 - What...? Where-where you going? What?\\
75 - Oh, okay!\\
76 - Who wants to play?\\
77 - Eddie, come on. I'll tell you what.\\
78 - I'll hit myself in the head with a rock.\\
79 - I'll even it out.\\
80 - No?\\
81 - Chubbo?\\
82 - You can eat with one hand, play with the other.\\
83 - Oh, I can't believe this.\\
84 - You're all cowards.\\
85 - Hey, funny-looking kid,\\
86 - you want to learn how to play chess?\\
87 - No, thanks.\\
88 - Come on.\\
89 - Look, it's not that hard.\\
90 - See, this one looks like a pretty little horsey.\\
91 - I know what a knight is.\\
92 - I also know how to counter a Nimzovich defense\\
93 - without leaving my queen's bishop wide open.\\
94 - Your whole left flank was Swiss cheese.\\
95 - Hey, junior champion.\\
96 - Read your Kasparov.\\
97 - The second you go after my bishop,\\
98 - you can kiss your rook and two pawns bye-bye!\\
99 - Oh, okay, I get it.\\
100 - You're  scared to play me!\\
101 - Yeah, I'm really scared of some troll in the park\\
102 - beating me at chess.\\
103 - Evidently, you are!\\
104 - Now you're confusing fear\\
105 - with pity.\\
106 - Fear triggers a fight or flight response\\
107 - while pity allows me\\
108 - to turn my back and walk away with a sadness\\
109 - for your misery!\\
110 - I would've kicked your ass.\\
111 - All right, that's it.\\
112 - Couldn't see... that coming.\\
113 - It's so nice to have the kids out of the...\\
114 - Dewey!\\
115 - What are you doing?!\\
116 - Painting the wall.\\
117 - What is the matter with you?\\
118 - Why on earth would you do this?\\
119 - The baby told me to.\\
120 - The ba...?\\
121 - What, this baby?\\
122 - It chose the color, too.\\
123 - I would have gone with more of an earth tone.\\
124 - Look...\\
125 - Listen, son, I know you're worried about the baby coming,\\
126 - but you don't have to be.\\
127 - Yes, you're not going to be the youngest anymore,\\
128 - and it is true the baby will get all of our attention\\
129 - for quite a while, and you will have to do a lot more work\\
130 - around the house, and probably have to share the bathroom...\\
131 - What your father's trying to say is,\\
132 - there is no reason for you to be acting out like this.\\
133 - Now get this mess cleaned up.\\
134 - And the baby is not talking to you.\\
135 - It said you'd say that.\\
136 - Draw.\\
137 - Draw?\\
138 - Draw.\\
139 - Draw.\\
140 - One more.\\
141 - No!\\
142 - It's been four hours!\\
143 - All right, all right. God.\\
144 - Who designed these damn cement benches anyway?\\
145 - Probably some stupid civil servant\\
146 - never made it through design class.\\
147 - Now he takes his frustrations out\\
148 - on the asses of the general public.\\
149 - What the hell is with that guy?\\
150 - He is so annoying.\\
151 - First it's too warm, then it's too cool,\\
152 - then the pigeons are walking funny.\\
153 - He didn't shut up for one second.\\
154 - I mean, give it a try, stop complaining.\\
155 - No, you want to know the worst thing about him?\\
156 - He kept picking at his...\\
157 - Four-nine-seven- three-six-seven...\\
158 - Stop doing that.\\
159 - Sorry.\\
160 - I'll be back in a couple of hours.\\
161 - Wait. Where you going?\\
162 - I told you, I'm posing\\
163 - in Otto's art class tonight.\\
164 - Posing? As in naked?\\
165 - Yes. We had this conversation.\\
166 - No, we haven't.\\
167 - I remember conversations with the word "naked" in them.\\
168 - You can't strip in front of Otto.\\
169 - I'm not spinning my tassels on a runway, Francis.\\
170 - I'm modeling at an art class.\\
171 - It's a job.\\
172 - They pay $250.\\
173 - Piama,\\
174 - I want to make sure\\
175 - I have the right pastels.\\
176 - What color are your nipples?\\
177 - It's all very tasteful,\\
178 - which is beside the point,\\
179 - because, guess what, it's my body,\\
180 - so you can't tell me what to do with it.\\
181 - If you're not mature enough\\
182 - to handle this, then that's your problem.\\
183 - $250?!\\
184 - Everything I knew about beauty was a lie.\\
185 - So this morning, Dewey tried to go to school in his underwear\\
186 - because apparently the baby doesn't like his wardrobe.\\
187 - The kid is driving me up the wall,\\
188 - and I keep gaining weight like crazy.\\
189 - More than a pound a day.\\
190 - Nobody gains a pound a day.\\
191 - It doesn't make any sense.\\
192 - Ah, I know, honey.\\
193 - It is baffling,\\
194 - but look, you've just got to stop obsessing\\
195 - about this weight thing.\\
196 - Let me pour you some juice.\\
197 - I don't want any juice, Hal.\\
198 - I know what's going on.\\
199 - You do? Of course I do.\\
200 - I'm not an idiot.\\
201 - I-I'm sorry. It's just...\\
202 - It's because I'm not working.\\
203 - Huh?\\
204 - It's obvious, Hal.\\
205 - I'm not getting the exercise I got\\
206 - with the other pregnancies.\\
207 - With the other kids,\\
208 - I was on my feet all day.\\
209 - Th-That makes perfect sense.\\
210 - Celery stick?\\
211 - My system must be so screwed up.\\
212 - This celery tastes exactly like bacon.\\
213 - Honey, listen to me.\\
214 - Don't make yourself crazy over a few pounds.\\
215 - You look amazing to me.\\
216 - No matter how big and round\\
217 - and jiggly you get.\\
218 - Hello.\\
219 - Hi, Mom.\\
220 - Tell the baby I got the stupid pail of sand,\\
221 - but now the buses have stopped running\\
222 - so I can't get home.\\
223 - Dewey?! Where are you?!\\
224 - I don't know exactly.\\
225 - Somewhere down by the pier.\\
226 - You're at the pier?!\\
227 - Where?\\
228 - Dewey, listen to me.\\
229 - You stay right where you are.\\
230 - We're coming to get you right now.\\
231 - Okay, but bring another pair of socks.\\
232 - I stepped in fish guts. Ew.\\
233 - What is wrong with that kid?\\
234 - I'm really getting worried.\\
235 - Let's just stay calm.\\
236 - We'll get in the car, go pick up some doughnuts,\\
237 - and we'll figure this out on the way.\\
238 - Another draw?\\
239 - Hey, Casey Kasem, why don't you do everybody a favor\\
240 - and turn that crap down?\\
241 - It's not loud.\\
242 - I didn't say it was loud.\\
243 - I said it was crap.\\
244 - So, uh, is this all you do every day?\\
245 - Just hang out in the park\\
246 - and play chess with strangers?\\
247 - No.\\
248 - I also enjoy long walks on the beach and bubble baths.\\
249 - Of course, I'd have to say my greatest turn-on is honesty.\\
250 - So basically, the only human contact you have\\
251 - is playing chess with people who can't stand you?\\
252 - I hate to burst your little after-school-special bubble,\\
253 - but I'm not some kind of loser.\\
254 - I have a perfect life.\\
255 - I have a great job selling toner over the phone.\\
256 - I make a few calls-- bing, bang, bing, it's 10:00.\\
257 - I've got the rest of the day to myself.\\
258 - You can't possibly make enough money doing that.\\
259 - I thought you were a little smarter than that, Malcolm.\\
260 - It's not about money. It's about freedom.\\
261 - I am my own man.\\
262 - I do what I want, when I want.\\
263 - I don't answer to anyone for anything, ever.\\
264 - Where's my 20 bucks, Leonard?\\
265 - You said you'd have it on Monday.\\
266 - Yeah, I have it, It's right here.\\
267 - I... you know, I was... I was looking for you.\\
268 - You know, I couldn't find you,\\
269 - and then I had some important business meetings\\
270 - that I had to get to, but here... 13, 14...\\
271 - Um, uh, you take\\
272 - cigarettes, right?\\
273 - I quit.\\
274 - Oh, good for you.\\
275 - That's so good because, you know,\\
276 - these things will kill you slow.\\
277 - Th-That's the truth, you know, and...\\
278 - and the cost is...\\
279 - Give him six bucks!\\
280 - Take it easy, George.\\
281 - What a dumbass!\\
282 - Well, I'm afraid time's up, everyone,\\
283 - but once again, let's thank our models\\
284 - for their hard work.\\
285 - Thank you.\\
286 - I'm just glad I had this opportunity\\
287 - to give something back.\\
288 - You were just wonderful, as always.\\
289 - Well, that's what I do.\\
290 - Oh, and Piama did well, too, don't you think?\\
291 - Francis, you have inspired me to new heights.\\
292 - See how I have captured\\
293 - the confident power of your torso,\\
294 - the sheer arrogance of your ass.\\
295 - Francis,\\
296 - come on, let's go.\\
297 - I'm talking to people here, if you don't mind.\\
298 - Sadly, someone's doing this  with  his soul,\\
299 - and somebody isn't.\\
300 - Hi, Mom.\\
301 - Hi, Dewey.\\
302 - You get in that house right now, mister!\\
303 - The baby did not tell you to drive the car!\\
304 - Well, it didn't exactly use the word "car."\\
305 - It called it a "go machine," but that's what it meant.\\
306 - What's this?\\
307 - Somebody had a birthday at the office,\\
308 - and nobody ate it because it's "fat-free."\\
309 - How come it doesn't say "happy birthday" or anything?\\
310 - Well, you know, office politics, but you wouldn't believe\\
311 - how PC some of these jerks can get.\\
312 -        \\
313 -        \\
314 - Look at this.\\
315 - I'm looking.\\
316 - You're really improving, Rubio.\\
317 - You've stopped making the "vroom" noises\\
318 - when you move your pieces.\\
319 - Hey, Leonard.\\
320 - Oh, you got to see this.\\
321 - Physically hurts, doesn't it?\\
322 - Listen, I was talking to this guy I know.\\
323 - I got you a job interview.\\
324 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
325 - You are a miserable person.\\
326 - You barely have a job, and you're completely dysfunctional\\
327 - when it comes to communicating with people.\\
328 - And that's my fault?\\
329 - It's not everyone else in the world?\\
330 - It doesn't have to be like that.\\
331 - If you have a job where you're around people,\\
332 - you can get used to each other and maybe turn things around.\\
333 - Forget it. I'm not wasting my time\\
334 - on some stupid job interview because you have\\
335 - some desperate need to save yourself through me.\\
336 - Why don't you invest some of that neurotic energy\\
337 - in confronting your own fear of failure?\\
338 - Oh, goodness, the clouds have parted,\\
339 - and I can now commit to a new life,\\
340 - thanks to your Oprah-esque psychological insights.\\
341 - And now you're trying to invalidate the real issue\\
342 - by dancing around it with what you think\\
343 - is clever wordplay.\\
344 - Screw this.\\
345 - I'll play you for it.\\
346 - Why bother? We draw every game.\\
347 - Not this time. Fine.\\
348 - But if you don't win,\\
349 - you never bring this crap up again.\\
350 - You're on.\\
351 - Where's my money, Leonard?\\
352 - George, uh, I got it, uh, just the other...\\
353 - Run!\\
354 - So, how much does this job pay?\\
355 - What are you doing?\\
356 - Can you hold these for a second?\\
357 - Sure.\\
358 - What's this for, anyway?\\
359 - You'll see.\\
360 - Are you crazy?\\
361 - It wasn't my idea.\\
362 - The baby told me to.\\
363 - Wait a minute-- Mom's baby?\\
364 - You think Mom's baby talks to you?\\
365 - Yes!\\
366 - It's telling me to do all these crazy things.\\
367 - Let me give you a little advice.\\
368 - You've got to ignore the voices.\\
369 - They are not on your side, and you never tell\\
370 - anyone about them-- especially your teachers.\\
371 - They get panicky for no reason.\\
372 - You understand?\\
373 - I think so. Attaboy.\\
374 - You're going to be okay.\\
375 - This is a terrible idea.\\
376 - No, this is just what you need.\\
377 - Remember? A job, people, a life.\\
378 - But why  here?\\
379 - Because this is the only guy I know\\
380 - that would trade a job interview\\
381 - for a Hong Kong Fooey lunch box.\\
382 - Greetings, Earthlings.\\
383 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
384 - Trust me, I know it's going to be hard,\\
385 - but if you can just keep your mouth shut\\
386 - for five minutes with this guy, you're home free.\\
387 - I'm waiting, princess.\\
388 - My r  sum  .\\
389 - Forget this.\\
390 - You can't learn anything from a r  sum  .\\
391 - So, tell me about your employment history.\\
392 - Well, I...\\
393 - Interesting. You know, I like to think of Lucky Aide\\
394 - as a kind of family, and in this family,\\
395 - I'd be your father,\\
396 - and as a father,\\
397 - there might be things\\
398 - I might ask of you that don't make sense,\\
399 - but you do it because I'm your father.\\
400 - No sassing back, just do it.\\
401 - Understand?\\
402 - Think so.\\
403 - Now,\\
404 - who are  you  in this family?\\
405 - Are you the second cousin?\\
406 - Or maybe the kooky aunt?\\
407 - Well, you know, I've always kind of seen myself\\
408 - in the role of the younger brother--\\
409 - eager to learn.\\
410 - I never had a brother.\\
411 - Well, I'm here.\\
412 - We can get started in a moment.\\
413 - Francis, I-I didn't call you.\\
414 - Yes, I noticed.\\
415 - I can't do your job  and  mine, Gloria.\\
416 - What? There's no Camembert?\\
417 - You expect me to have my wine without any Camembert?\\
418 - That ruins my entire aesthetic!\\
419 - Francis... Forget it.\\
420 - I'll work without cheese.\\
421 - Who is this?\\
422 - That's Jeremy, our model for the evening.\\
423 - That's why I didn't call you.\\
424 - Francis,\\
425 - we have already sketched your fabulous haunches,\\
426 - and now it is time for us to examine\\
427 - the interplay of light and shadow on Jeremy's love handles.\\
428 - That's it?\\
429 - That's how it ends?\\
430 - You just casually discard me like yesterday's fish?\\
431 - After you've sucked out the essence of my soul?\\
432 - Francis, please, try to understand.\\
433 - No, I  don't  understand!\\
434 - I let you see every color in the spectrum of my being,\\
435 - and you have rejected it!\\
436 - Someday, you'll realize what you turned your back on,\\
437 - and you will curse yourself\\
438 - for your banality and your shortsightedness,\\
439 - but by then it will be too late because I will be gone!\\
440 - Yes, gone!\\
441 - Um... can I have my robe?\\
442 - Craig's been yammering nonstop for almost an hour.\\
443 - He even made Leonard follow him into the bathroom,\\
444 - but Leonard's tough.\\
445 - Now, let's talk about respect--\\
446 - not self-respect but respect for one's superiors.\\
447 - Now I remember a time... think quick!\\
448 - That's just a little\\
449 - management test I came up with\\
450 - to see whether you're the type of person\\
451 - who confronts problems head-on or avoids them.\\
452 - Which one were you?\\
453 - Both.\\
454 - Good.\\
455 - And I see that you have no spine.\\
456 - Welcome aboard.\\
457 - Come back in an hour,\\
458 - and we'll get you a trainee vest and a name tag.\\
459 - Congratulations. I knew you could do it.\\
460 - Oh, my God, that guy is an idiot.\\
461 - You only had to do an interview with him.\\
462 - Trying having dinner with that jackass\\
463 - and his stupid cat.\\
464 - The cat can't be any stupider than this guy.\\
465 - This moron just tried to use a Barbie doll\\
466 - to explain the hygiene procedures.\\
467 - Brother, huh?\\
468 - I think I'll stay an only child, thank you.\\
469 - Mom! Dad!\\
470 - Dewey!\\
471 - Oh, right.\\
472 - I have had it with you, Dewey.\\
473 - I have enough on my mind without having to deal with this!\\
474 - But the baby says...\\
475 - Listen to me.\\
476 - That baby is not talking to you.\\
477 - Honey, just try to calm down, okay?\\
478 - I'll make you some tea.\\
479 - You have to stop using this\\
480 - as an excuse to get attention,\\
481 - because it is not going to work!\\
482 - Now, I don't want to hear another word\\
483 - about you talking to that baby, understand?\\
484 - The baby says to turn around.\\
485 - What?\\
486 - Hal.\\
487 - Well, you don't take yours with maple syrup?\\
488 - Craig was pretty upset.\\
489 - He wouldn't come out of the photo booth for two hours.\\
490 - Where's Leonard?\\
491 - Has anyone seen Leonard?\\
492 - He told me to give this to you.\\
493 - "Malcolm, I moved away,\\
494 - "but I want to thank you\\
495 - "for confirming everything I said\\
496 - "about people being giant jackasses.\\
497 - "One day you'll understand.\\
498 - People like us will never belong."\\
499 - What does he mean, "people like us"?\\
500 - What? I hate when you do that.\\
501 - If you have something to say, just say it.\\
502 - That is  so  annoying.
\subsection {Episode 20: Baby (Part 1)}
1 - Oh, for God's sake, what was that?!\\
2 - Wherever you are, whatever you've done,\\
3 - don't think I won't find you.\\
4 -     Life is unfair.    \\
5 - We're so glad Francis decided to come down for a visit.\\
6 - It's been so long since we've seen him.\\
7 - And you tagging along is an added bonus.\\
8 - Well, making you happy makes me happy.\\
9 - You know, I don't think that nursery\\
10 - would ever get done without Francis' help.\\
11 - Hal has this thing about heights.\\
12 - I can't reach it.\\
13 - Dad, you have to come up another rung.\\
14 - My ears are popping!\\
15 - So my doctor said I only have to wear\\
16 - these special shoes for two more years.\\
17 - Then I'm down to nights and weekends.\\
18 - Great Scott! You got a letter\\
19 - from Martindale Academy!\\
20 - What's Martindale Academy?\\
21 - It's the greatest,\\
22 - most advanced private school in existence.\\
23 - Do you know how many millions they've spent\\
24 - to make sure you've never heard about it?\\
25 - It says I've been accepted.\\
26 - I didn't even apply.\\
27 - No one applies. They find you.\\
28 - This is unbelievable.\\
29 - Malcolm, you're going to the show.\\
30 - You're set for life!\\
31 - Wait, what am I thinking?\\
32 - You can't go. You're too poor.\\
33 - You're like the poorest guy I know.\\
34 - Oh, I'm such a jerk!\\
35 - Here I am, describing this nirvana\\
36 - you'll never be able to experience.\\
37 - Holding out this hope of power and success\\
38 - to a guy in a three-dollar shirt.\\
39 - I mean, look at this hovel!\\
40 - Lloyd, you have to stop talking.\\
41 - It's okay to cry, Malcolm.\\
42 - Tears are free.\\
43 - Okay, everybody.\\
44 - Just got back from the doctor\\
45 - and everything's fine,\\
46 - but baby's a little bit bigger than expected.\\
47 - So, instead of having the baby in two weeks\\
48 - like we thought, we're going\\
49 - to induce labor on Thursday.\\
50 - Thursday?!\\
51 - This Thursday?!\\
52 - You can't do that!\\
53 - Oh, what difference does it make?\\
54 - It's just six days sooner that our lives are over.\\
55 - Hal.\\
56 - And... our new, more fulfilling lives begin.\\
57 - This stinks.\\
58 - I know this is being\\
59 - sprung on you very suddenly,\\
60 - and you all have a right to be a little upset.\\
61 - A little?! Don't push it.\\
62 - Hal, you know what? I've got an idea.\\
63 - Why don't you take the boys\\
64 - out tomorrow and do something fun?\\
65 - I could use the time alone anyway\\
66 - to straighten up the house before the baby comes.\\
67 - I can help you clean.\\
68 - Well, that'll take a little longer,\\
69 - but I guess I could use the company.\\
70 - Hey, there's a car show\\
71 - at the convention center.\\
72 - Yeah, let's spend the whole day\\
73 - looking at cool things that we'll never get to own.\\
74 - Oh, come on, Malcolm, if we only looked at stuff we could afford,\\
75 - all we'd ever see is crap.\\
76 - Don't be a party pooper.\\
77 - It'll be great.\\
78 - "Festival of Brides"?\\
79 - That's the lamest name for a car show I've ever heard.\\
80 - No, the car show was here last week.\\
81 - Let's get out of here.\\
82 - No. I just dropped 15 bucks on parking.\\
83 - We're going in.\\
84 - I know it's your fifth child,\\
85 - but still, you must be a little excited.\\
86 - Well, sure, every child is exciting.\\
87 - Not that you want to rush into something like that.\\
88 - Oh!\\
89 - Wow.\\
90 - You okay?\\
91 - The baby just started kicking like crazy.\\
92 - It's almost like something was upsetting...\\
93 - Mom!\\
94 - Are you going to open the door\\
95 - or should I lie down in the grass and feed the worms?\\
96 - Oh, great.\\
97 - Who opened the gates of hell?\\
98 - Mom? This is a surprise.\\
99 - What are you doing here?\\
100 - I'm moving in.\\
101 - What do you mean you're moving in?\\
102 - You are family, you will take care of me.\\
103 - This is ridiculous.\\
104 - You have a condo.\\
105 - It's nicer than this house.\\
106 - It burned down.\\
107 - Mother, you can't just...\\
108 - How did your house burn down?\\
109 - It was the villagers, wasn't it?\\
110 - It's a mystery.\\
111 - Why don't you go stay at Susan's?\\
112 - She has four extra bedrooms and a satellite dish.\\
113 - Your sister should stick her head in a can of beans!\\
114 - What?!\\
115 - She's always been your favorite.\\
116 - She's the only one you called when Dad died.\\
117 - She isn't my favorite anymore!\\
118 - She called me bitter!\\
119 - Then she hung up on me.\\
120 - On me!\\
121 - Or maybe I hung up on her.\\
122 - Who remembers?\\
123 - Either way, she should rot in hell.\\
124 - Mother, we can't afford to put you up here.\\
125 - You can afford a maid.\\
126 - I'm not the maid, Ida.\\
127 - My name is Piama.\\
128 - I'm married to Francis.\\
129 - Tell the help not to talk to me.\\
130 -     Yahoo    \\
131 -     Celebrate good times, come on    \\
132 -     It's a celebration...    \\
133 - I know I haven't been everywhere,\\
134 - but I'm pretty sure\\
135 - this is the most boring place on Earth.\\
136 - What are you talking about, Reese?\\
137 - Do you know what kind of craftsmanship\\
138 - goes into these lace veils? Huh?\\
139 - So, uh, Dad, I was wondering,\\
140 - do you have any kind of savings put away?\\
141 - Ooh, I'll have to tell your mother that one.\\
142 - No, I'm serious.\\
143 - What if something came up?\\
144 - Like a big, unexpected expense?\\
145 - Are you prepared for something like that?\\
146 - Don't worry about that stuff, son.\\
147 - Things have a way of taking care of themselves.\\
148 - But... Come on.\\
149 - You boys are young. You're at a bridal expo.\\
150 - You should be having the time of your lives.\\
151 - Dewey?\\
152 - Dewey?\\
153 - What are those wires for?\\
154 - You see that big spotlight up there?\\
155 - I'm in charge of that puppy.\\
156 - You like it?\\
157 - I really do.\\
158 - I'd like to tell you a little story.\\
159 - Are you going to let her\\
160 - get away with this?\\
161 - You are, aren't you?\\
162 - She's my mother.\\
163 - You know the way I am around her.\\
164 - Okay, if that's what you want.\\
165 - That woman being one of\\
166 - the first people your new baby sees\\
167 - when it comes into this world.\\
168 - Smiling down at it,\\
169 - cradling it in her arms.\\
170 - You're right. She's got to go.\\
171 - Mom.\\
172 - There's something important that I have to tell you.\\
173 - What is it?\\
174 - You are a horrible mother!\\
175 - You've always been a horrible mother!\\
176 - My whole childhood\\
177 - you'd bully me and ignore me\\
178 - and trivialize my feelings\\
179 - and do nothing but heap praise\\
180 - on my sister until I felt like I was worthless in comparison!\\
181 - Well, now she's worthless.\\
182 - I've got a right to change my mind.\\
183 - But just because your sister disgusts me more than you do\\
184 - doesn't give you the right to talk to me like this!\\
185 - I will talk to you any damn way I want, you hateful old woman!\\
186 - You are leaving!\\
187 - Wow! I don't know how\\
188 - I finally summoned the strength to do that,\\
189 - but it feels great!\\
190 - Now I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!\\
191 - Get out of my house!\\
192 - No.\\
193 - What?\\
194 - You heard me. I said "no."\\
195 - What do you mean, "no"?\\
196 - You don't have any choice.\\
197 - What are you going to do?\\
198 - Pick me up and throw me out?\\
199 - Are you going to toss an old woman out into the street?\\
200 - In front of your neighbors?\\
201 - Sounds good to me.\\
202 - Whoa! You brought this on yourself,\\
203 - you old monster.\\
204 - You have no idea how good this makes me...\\
205 - Attention, ladies and gentlemen.\\
206 - It's your "clucky" day.\\
207 - Chicken dance lessons are being given every ten minutes\\
208 - at the Fielding Dance Academy pavilion.\\
209 - Excuse me.\\
210 - Can I talk to you for a second?\\
211 - Hey, can you get me a piece with a flower?\\
212 - I'm talking to an actual customer right now.\\
213 - I'm a customer.\\
214 - Yeah? Are you getting married?\\
215 - Why, does somebody like me?\\
216 - Hey, what are you, about five-seven? Yeah.\\
217 - Perfect. I own a tux shop.\\
218 - One of my models didn't show up.\\
219 - I'll give you 20 bucks if you walk around\\
220 - the floor in a tux and pass out my card. Buzz off.\\
221 - 20 bucks? He'll do it.\\
222 - Need anybody in my size?\\
223 - It's very simple.\\
224 - You just walk up to somebody, get down on one knee,\\
225 - hand them one of my cards and say,\\
226 - "I propose that you get your tuxedo from Wojodubakowski's."\\
227 - No problem.\\
228 -     Everyone around the world, come on    \\
229 - I think the accordion is really underrated.\\
230 - Yes! Yes, it is!\\
231 -     Yahoo!    \\
232 - What are you doing today at 3:16?\\
233 - Hey, sir, how about some cake?\\
234 - Sure.\\
235 - Can I have a piece with the flower?\\
236 - No. You get one with a flower and a little lemon bee on it.\\
237 - Mom, wake up.\\
238 - Take the children.\\
239 - Just let me live.\\
240 - Remember, I didn't want to do this.\\
241 - Do what?\\
242 - That's the police. You see what you've driven me to?\\
243 - I've actually called the police on my own mother.\\
244 - They're here to cart you away.\\
245 - How could you do this to me?!\\
246 - After everything I've done for you?\\
247 - We're family, for God's sake!\\
248 - Good. You're here.\\
249 - That's them. Get 'em out of here.\\
250 - What?!\\
251 - They've been stealing from me.\\
252 - I want them out of my house.\\
253 - Wait a minute.\\
254 - No, this is my house!\\
255 - Folks, let's just slow down.\\
256 - I have the deed. It's in the safety deposit box\\
257 - at the Valley Federal Bank.\\
258 - Number 24866. You can check.\\
259 - No! I have the deed!\\
260 - It's, uh, yeah, uh...\\
261 - It's in a shoe box.\\
262 - It's under-under my bed...\\
263 - Well, I don't know where it is, but this is my house!\\
264 - You devious, ungrateful girl!\\
265 - She's done nothing but lie\\
266 - since the day I took her in.\\
267 - And her big boyfriend\\
268 - thinks he's so tough.\\
269 - How tough is it to hit an old woman.\\
270 - You... dirty old...!\\
271 - This is what she does.\\
272 - You have to stop her.\\
273 - You have to stop her!\\
274 - As I was saying, she is a very clever woman,\\
275 - and if you knew her as I do,\\
276 - you too would be suspicious of her story.\\
277 - And on Monday, when the bank opens,\\
278 - whoever actually has the deed can go get it.\\
279 - Then you apply for a court order\\
280 - and the whole thing should be straightened out\\
281 - in six to eight months.\\
282 - You can get up now, sir.\\
283 - And if you hurt a single hair\\
284 - on that old lady's head, I'll be back.\\
285 - Off duty.\\
286 - Pass the rolls.\\
287 - You think that bothers me?\\
288 - Guess why your soup tasted different\\
289 - when you came back from bathroom.\\
290 - Ugh.\\
291 - There has to be some way to get rid of her.\\
292 - Well, we know she doesn't burn.\\
293 - Let's just face it. We're stuck with her.\\
294 - You can't give up.\\
295 - You can totally do this.\\
296 - I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do.\\
297 - She's too powerful.\\
298 - Every monster has its weakness.\\
299 - Frankenstein has fire.\\
300 - Dracula, the cross.\\
301 - There has to be something that Grandma's afraid of.\\
302 - So, what would you like me to do for you?\\
303 - Well, it's, uh...\\
304 - It's kind of hard to say,\\
305 - Abe, um...\\
306 - It-it has to do with my mother.\\
307 - Oh, I know about mothers. Every time\\
308 - mine comes over to Sunday dinner,\\
309 - she always brings that pecan pie\\
310 - with real whipped cream.\\
311 - And she knows that's my one weakness.\\
312 - Our grandma's kind of like that.\\
313 - Except she's a wrinkled sack of hatred\\
314 - kept alive only by the will to destroy.\\
315 - We just want her out of the house,\\
316 - and she refuses to leave.\\
317 - And I have this idea.\\
318 - You see,\\
319 - she's a horrible bigot.\\
320 - I mean, she's\\
321 - terrified of...\\
322 - black people.\\
323 - Oh.\\
324 - What do you want me to...?\\
325 - Oh. Oh-oh, I see.\\
326 - B-Because I'm...\\
327 - Well, you want me to...\\
328 - Well, I-I suppose I...\\
329 - Really?\\
330 - I'd do it, but I'm not dark enough.\\
331 - I just annoy her.\\
332 - And then  I  said,\\
333 - "Orange you glad I didn't say 'banana'?"\\
334 - Hey.\\
335 - I found these in the trash.\\
336 - Can we discuss this later?\\
337 - I'm with friends.\\
338 - Give me the tux.\\
339 - What?\\
340 - Thank you. No!\\
341 - I like this tux. It's mine.\\
342 - It's not yours. Now give it back, or I'll call security.\\
343 - Hey, I'm over there!\\
344 - Hey... you...\\
345 - Hey!\\
346 - Tell me which one you like.\\
347 - And be honest.\\
348 - Dad, I just want to know.\\
349 - Do you have any kind of financial plan at all?\\
350 - Any plan about anything?\\
351 - Malcolm, I'm telling you for the last time,\\
352 - stop worrying about money.\\
353 - Hey, I do your taxes. I know what you and Mom make.\\
354 - I know how much you're spending,\\
355 - and I have a pretty good idea what it costs to have a baby.\\
356 - You guys are going to be at least 70 bucks\\
357 - in the hole every month.\\
358 - By the time the baby starts school,\\
359 - you're going to be $18,000 in debt,\\
360 - and that's where they'll cut you off.\\
361 - You're going to be bankrupt and ruined.\\
362 - Something will come up.\\
363 - You can't keep saying that.\\
364 - Fine. I'm a failure as a father.\\
365 - I'm a terrible provider.\\
366 - Is that what you want to hear?\\
367 - No.\\
368 - But I have a way to fix it.\\
369 - What's this?\\
370 - It's from the Martindale Academy.\\
371 - It's this amazing prep school...\\
372 - but it's in London.\\
373 - They're offering me a complete scholarship.\\
374 - Tuition, housing,\\
375 - everything.\\
376 - If I'm not home...\\
377 - you just might make it.\\
378 - I'm totally willing to do it.\\
379 - Absolutely not.\\
380 - You don't get to leave.\\
381 - But you... Malcolm, you're our only hope.\\
382 - Hold this. Sure.\\
383 - Now let me explain something to you.\\
384 - Whenever your mother or I say\\
385 - "Something will come up" or "Things will work out,"\\
386 - that is our code for "Malcolm will think of something."\\
387 - But... We need you.\\
388 - The family is only a family\\
389 - as long as we all stick together.\\
390 - Where's Dewey?\\
391 - Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll please\\
392 - turn your attention to the man with the balloon,\\
393 - and listen to the following\\
394 - heart-wrenching story.\\
395 - Hello. My name is Dewey.\\
396 - And the man with the balloon is my father, Hal.\\
397 - Dewey?\\
398 - Where are you?\\
399 - See,\\
400 - I'm the youngest of four kids,\\
401 - and I always get the short end of everything.\\
402 - I've never had a hot shower or a bed to myself.\\
403 - I'm the third person to wear this underwear.\\
404 - And yet, I've never complained.\\
405 - Dewey, what is this about?!\\
406 - Even when my parents decided to have another baby.\\
407 - I was happy to share\\
408 - what little I have.\\
409 - And then they told me they're inducing labor.\\
410 - And they picked a really interesting day to do it.\\
411 - Do you remember what day you picked, Dad?\\
412 - Dewey!\\
413 - What day did you pick, Dad?\\
414 - It's Thursday.\\
415 - Just come down from... wherever you are.\\
416 - Of all the days you could have picked,\\
417 - you chose this Thursday.\\
418 - Anything interesting about Thursday, Dad?\\
419 - Will you stop this?\\
420 - Anything at all you can think of\\
421 - that might be happening this Thursday?\\
422 - Okay, Dewey, what is the big deal about Thursday?\\
423 - It's my birthday.\\
424 - It is not your...\\
425 - Oh, God!\\
426 - Well, ladies and gentleman...\\
427 - that's the story of the little boy\\
428 - who lost his birthday.\\
429 - If you have any thoughts or comments,\\
430 - my dad would love to hear them.\\
431 - This would be a good time\\
432 - for one of those ideas we were talking about.\\
433 - I've got nothing.\\
434 - Thank you so much for coming over.\\
435 - I know this is a little weird.\\
436 - Actually, I'm kind of excited.\\
437 - This is kind of like\\
438 - when I did  Spoon River Anthology in college.\\
439 - Do we  have to hear that story again?\\
440 - We sold out both shows.\\
441 - Four pillows on one bed.\\
442 - This is why you can't feed your children.\\
443 - Oh, hi, Mom.\\
444 - I'd like you to meet some of our friends.\\
445 - This is Brian and this is Abe.\\
446 - Nice to meet you, ma'am.\\
447 - If you'll\\
448 - excuse me.\\
449 - I need to use...\\
450 - your toilet.\\
451 - I've been telling Abe\\
452 - all about you.\\
453 - Welcome...\\
454 - to da... hood... yo, yo.\\
455 - Gettin' all jiggly with it.\\
456 - Representin'.\\
457 - Uh... uh...\\
458 - Can't touch this.\\
459 - Abe? Huh?\\
460 - Chill.\\
461 - Hello.\\
462 - Everybody decent?\\
463 - I used my spare key to get in.\\
464 - I hope you don't mind.\\
465 - That's why you have it.\\
466 - So you can come over\\
467 - anytime you want.\\
468 - Mom, these are our neighbors.\\
469 - Steve lives next door.\\
470 - Malik is on the other side.\\
471 - And Trey lives across the street.\\
472 - Why, Lois, you make it sound\\
473 - like you're... surrounded.\\
474 - Allow me.\\
475 - Well, hello.\\
476 - And who is this fine lady?\\
477 - So what you doing\\
478 - later on?\\
479 - 'Cause I like that wagon\\
480 - you draggin'.\\
481 - Mom, where are you going?\\
482 - I can't believe you live like this.\\
483 - I would rather sleep in a bus station\\
484 - or a Dumpster.\\
485 - Well, there's obviously\\
486 - nothing I can do to change your mind,\\
487 - but I'm heartbroken.\\
488 - You only just got here. I...\\
489 - What's wrong with you?\\
490 - Nothing.\\
491 - Everything is perfectly fine.\\
492 - Francis,\\
493 - you have to listen very carefully.\\
494 - God, I'm having a contraction.\\
495 - I'm going into labor. What?\\
496 - I have to get to the hospital,\\
497 - and you have got to get your grandmother out of here  now.\\
498 - Come on, Ida. Let me help you.\\
499 - Don't you have rain dance to do?\\
500 - Bye, Mom.\\
501 - Great to see you.\\
502 - Have a safe trip.\\
503 - Don't forget to call us whenever you get to...\\
504 - wherever...\\
505 - Maybe I'll stay few more minutes.\\
506 - Well, Dewey, I hope you're happy.\\
507 - I thought I would be, but not  this  much.\\
508 - Let's find Reese and get out of here.\\
509 - Why is my cell phone off?\\
510 - 68 messages?!\\
511 - The contraction started\\
512 - at 3:27.\\
513 - Oh, this one can tell time.\\
514 - Hello.\\
515 - Oh, hello, Hal.\\
516 - Oh, no, I'm fine.\\
517 - Now, honey,\\
518 - I don't want you to get too excited,\\
519 - but I think you should come home now,\\
520 - because, I'm... well, I'm...\\
521 - I'm having the baby.\\
522 - What?!\\
523 - O... kay.\\
524 - Well, just... stay calm, too.\\
525 - Yeah, getting worked up will only accelerate things.\\
526 - Just relax.\\
527 - Do your breathing.\\
528 - Where the hell is Reese? What's wrong?\\
529 - Your mom is having the baby now.\\
530 - See? Was that so hard?\\
531 - Now, Hal, I don't want you to panic.\\
532 - You drive safely.\\
533 - There's no reason to rush.\\
534 - Rush? Come on. You know me better than that.\\
535 - Find your brother!\\
536 - So, I'm just going to make myself some tea\\
537 - and relax until you get here.\\
538 - Good idea.\\
539 - You know, chamomile always relaxes me.\\
540 - Reese! Damn it, Reese, where are you?!\\
541 - I'm thinking of taking Sixth Street home.\\
542 - You want me to stop and pick up some ice cream?\\
543 - Reese! Where are you?\\
544 - Over here. Reese?!\\
545 - I'm inside the giant violin case.\\
546 - Damn it! Get him out of there.\\
547 - So, is that a yes on the ice cream?\\
548 - No, I'm fine.\\
549 - Just come on home... carefully.\\
550 - Oh. Sure thing.\\
551 - Honey, can you hold on a second?\\
552 - Ow!\\
553 - Hey, what are you doing?\\
554 - Boys, run!\\
555 - The boys send their love, too.\\
556 - Hey! Hey, you come back here!\\
557 - Your kid ran off with my $600 tuxedo!\\
558 - So, we're just pulling out of the garage right now.\\
559 - Got it on the oldies station.\\
560 - They're doing a Beatles "A" to "Z."\\
561 - Can you think of a Beatles song that starts with "Z"?\\
562 - 'Cause, frankly, I can't.\\
563 - Hal...\\
564 - You sound funny. Is everything okay?\\
565 - Yeah, just turning onto Maple.\\
566 - Hey, the gas station by the church\\
567 - stopped selling diesel.\\
568 - Ow!\\
569 - Shotgun!\\
570 - Wow, honey, you wouldn't believe the huge pothole\\
571 - we just went over.\\
572 - Let's go, Dad!\\
573 - Oh! I can't find the keys!\\
574 - Keys?\\
575 - Where the hell are the keys?!\\
576 - I got 'em.\\
577 - Now let's go!\\
578 - Hal?\\
579 - Honey, can I call you back?
\subsection {Episode 21: Baby (Part 2)}

2 - Baby's a little bit bigger than expected.\\
3 - So we're going to induce labor on Thursday.\\
4 - Festival of Brides?\\
5 - I just dropped 15 bucks on parking.\\
6 - We're going in.\\
7 - Baby just started kicking like crazy.\\
8 - It's almost like something was upsetting...\\
9 - Mom!\\
10 - I'm moving in.\\
11 - Everybody decent?\\
12 - God, I'm having a contraction. I'm going into labor.\\
13 - What? I have to get to the hospital.\\
14 - Got it on the oldies station.\\
15 - They're doing a Beatles "A" to "Z."\\
16 - So I'm just going to make myself some tea\\
17 - and relax until you get here.\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - These contractions are coming so close together!\\
31 - Oh!\\
32 - Lois, you have to stop doing that.\\
33 - You are really freaking me out.\\
34 - Yeah, me, too, Lois. And I'm a doctor.\\
35 - We can't wait for Hal anymore.\\
36 - We've got to go to the hospital now!\\
37 - You really think you're ever going\\
38 - to see your husband again? Mom!\\
39 - He's a man, isn't he?\\
40 - He's had his way with you.\\
41 - What's he need to stick around for?\\
42 - Look, if you're not going to have the decency\\
43 - to choke on the fumes of your own bile,\\
44 - can you at least take your poison over to Aunt Susan's?\\
45 - Did she ask me to come? Did she call you? No.\\
46 - No, of course not. She only wants to see me suffer.\\
47 - Can you imagine how she's laughing at me,\\
48 - knowing that now I'm stuck with  you  as my favorite.\\
49 - Knock, knock.\\
50 - Lois, I need to borrow a coat hanger.\\
51 - I dropped my sandwich underneath my car seat.\\
52 - What's going on here?\\
53 - Lois is in labor, and Hal's not here.\\
54 - I have dreamed of this moment!\\
55 - Here's what we're going to do.\\
56 - I'm going to carry you in my arms to my van.\\
57 - I have one of the three original sirens from Starsky and Hutch.\\
58 - I can make that trip in seven minutes flat.\\
59 - You're talking crazy!\\
60 - There were only two sirens used in that entire series,\\
61 - and they're both in the Smithsonian.\\
62 - Au contraire. There were four sirens.\\
63 - Oh, Hal, where are you?\\
64 - Well, let's go! Your mother's in labor!\\
65 - We just wasted 45 minutes in the security office.\\
66 - Just our luck-- we get a rent-a-cop\\
67 - trying to make sergeant.\\
68 - I think he made you pee in that jar just because he could.\\
69 - You boys have  really  outdone yourselves this time.\\
70 - Now, I'm going to take your mom to the hospital,\\
71 - and I'm not going to hear one word\\
72 - out of any of you until we come back with the baby.\\
73 - Okay, Dr. Kerr's going to meet you at the hospital.\\
74 - The guys are packing your bag,\\
75 - and Craig is cleaning out his car to make room for you.\\
76 - Two more trips\\
77 - and we're good to go.\\
78 - We're ready.\\
79 - What are you doing with all those suitcases?\\
80 - I told you she didn't need both sundresses.\\
81 - Hey, don't look at me.\\
82 - When I fly, I take one carry-on. That's it.\\
83 - I'm ready to go to the hospital. What?\\
84 - You're not going to the hospital.\\
85 - I'm not going? You're  not going.\\
86 - Oh, you want to go to the hospital so bad?\\
87 - I'll send you to the hospital.\\
88 - I'll send  you to the hospital!\\
89 - Nobody's going to the hospital!\\
90 - It's too late.\\
91 - Somebody call the paramedics. I'm having the baby here.\\
92 - Boys, call me a taxi,\\
93 - and then call Dr. Kerr, let him know your mom's in labor.\\
94 - He's in the book.\\
95 - Then call AAA...\\
96 - Dad, calm down.\\
97 - I will not calm down!\\
98 - Hello. Hello?! Oh!\\
99 - Hello! Lois?\\
100 - What?! Honey!\\
101 - Sir, stop moving.\\
102 - What'd she say?!\\
103 - My wife's at home, and she's having our baby right now!\\
104 - I have to get home to her!\\
105 - She's having the baby at home?\\
106 - Sir, you're not going anywhere in the shape you're in.\\
107 - Give him ten milligrams of diazepam.\\
108 - Let me out of here.\\
109 - I'm fine! Wait. What is that?\\
110 - What-what is that?\\
111 - Wha-What does that do?\\
112 - Breathe in a bit.\\
113 - I've got to get home to her!\\
114 - Give him ten more. I want him immobilized.\\
115 - Why don't you boys come with me?\\
116 - We have all sorts\\
117 - of fun magazines in the waiting area.\\
118 - You like  Highlights? You like "Goofus and Gallant"?\\
119 - We don't want to read stupid magazines.\\
120 - Our mom is having a baby!\\
121 - I'm sure she's being very well taken care of,\\
122 - and so's your father,\\
123 - so there's nothing for you boys to do\\
124 - but relax and wait for someone to come and get you.\\
125 - But we have to do something. This is all our fault.\\
126 - You're obviously very upset young men,\\
127 - and frankly, I have no idea how to deal with you.\\
128 - That's why I'm not in pediatrics.\\
129 - Now, let's go into the waiting room\\
130 - like I told you.\\
131 - If you don't want to look at magazines,\\
132 - I'm sure there's a chair you can spin around in.\\
133 - My God, what does this woman weigh?!\\
134 - I'm losing my grip on her thigh!\\
135 - Let's get her to the bed!\\
136 - Let's get her in there! Let's go!\\
137 - Move it, move it, move it!\\
138 - All right, all right, all right! Count of three, count of three.\\
139 - One, two... three!\\
140 - That was like moving\\
141 - - a concert grand. - Just relax, Mom.\\
142 - The paramedics will be here soon and they'll know what to do.\\
143 - Don't worry, Lois, I just Googled the word "baby."\\
144 - Here we go. 28 million matches-- there ought to be\\
145 - something useful in there. Craig, get off that thing.\\
146 - We don't need it. Trey's a doctor.\\
147 - Oh, no, Lois, I'm a dentist.\\
148 - But you have medical training, don't you?\\
149 - Yes, but I took up dentistry\\
150 - specifically because... well, that area down there,\\
151 - whe-when I look at it, I get giggly.\\
152 - I just do...\\
153 - since high school.\\
154 - Oh, for God's sakes.\\
155 - I doubt I'm the only one.\\
156 - The paramedics are... oh. Hi, is Malcolm home?\\
157 - No, and we're in... I just need to use his notes for my biochem homework.\\
158 - This really isn't a good time.\\
159 - You don't say hello to your own grandmother?\\
160 - I'm not Malcolm. We've been through this before.\\
161 - Oh, God, the baby is pressing down\\
162 - so hard on my cervix!\\
163 - Well, good, looks like everything's under control here.\\
164 - Piama and I are going to head out\\
165 - back to the ranch.\\
166 - What are you talking about?\\
167 - Nothing! You think I'm running away?\\
168 - You think being here when my own mother gives birth\\
169 - is-is making me so intensely uncomfortable\\
170 - I've made up a fake excuse to leave?\\
171 - That is not even a tiny bit true.\\
172 - Okay, clothes for babies, names for babies,\\
173 - truck drivers dressed like... ew.\\
174 - Excuse me, can somebody help me\\
175 - find Malcolm's biochem notes?\\
176 - I need them\\
177 - to do my assignment.\\
178 - Get out of here, Lloyd!\\
179 - I'm in labor! I'm about to give birth!\\
180 - It's a really important assignment.\\
181 - We are the worst kids in the world.\\
182 - Mom was right.\\
183 - We really  are  evil little trolls who have absolutely\\
184 - no consideration for anything\\
185 - but ourselves,\\
186 - and destroy everything we come in contact with,\\
187 - and we're lucky if we don't end up in prison or dead.\\
188 - Here's what we're going to do.\\
189 - There's a class that starts here\\
190 - in ten minutes.\\
191 - It's all about how to be parents to newborn babies.\\
192 - We're going to take it.\\
193 - What are you talking about?\\
194 - We're going to learn how to help out.\\
195 - We're going to learn how to be good for once.\\
196 - All right! Yeah, this baby's not going to get\\
197 - dropped on its head all the time.\\
198 - Yeah!\\
199 - What?\\
200 - Take a deep breath, and blow it out\\
201 - like you're blowing out a candle.\\
202 - Oh! Oh!\\
203 - Oh! Oh, my God!\\
204 - I thought my fingers were going to explode!\\
205 - - Way to breathe through it. - Hey, hey,\\
206 - I found something!\\
207 - There's been a slight increase in the incidence\\
208 - of babies born with a tail.\\
209 - I wonder if that makes it easier to tell when they're happy?\\
210 - Where the hell are those paramedics?\\
211 - They'll be here any second.\\
212 - Steve called them\\
213 - ten minutes ago.\\
214 - Yeah, that's right.\\
215 - That's what I did ten minutes ago.\\
216 - So, when did you get this wallpaper?\\
217 - So, anyway,\\
218 - we just feel awful,\\
219 - and that's why we really want to take this class.\\
220 - Oh, my God, you should feel awful.\\
221 - You're horrible children.\\
222 - That's our point.\\
223 - Well, I suppose\\
224 - everyone deserves another chance.\\
225 - All right, you can take the class.\\
226 - Thank you. Ah, we're in. Yes!\\
227 - When your milk duct is blocked,\\
228 - it's called mastitis.\\
229 - It's important that you let your baby\\
230 - suck the obstruction out of the breast,\\
231 - and don't be alarmed if the baby then vomits up\\
232 - a cottage cheese-type substance.\\
233 - Now, join me over here...\\
234 - Like I needed another reason to hate cottage cheese.\\
235 - I've been kind of zoning in and out here,\\
236 - but did she just say milk comes out of those things?\\
237 - Reese, that's what they're for.\\
238 - My God!\\
239 - Women are the cows of people!\\
240 - Oh!\\
241 - I'm coming, Lois.\\
242 - I'm coming, Lois!\\
243 - I'm coming, Lois!\\
244 - I'm coming, Lois!\\
245 - I'm coming, Lois! I'm coming!\\
246 - I'm coming, Lois!\\
247 - I'm coming!\\
248 - I'm coming, Lois! I'm coming!\\
249 - I'm c...\\
250 - I'm coming...\\
251 - Lois.\\
252 - Here, I brought some towels\\
253 - to put under your knees.\\
254 - Oh, Piama,\\
255 - don't use the good towels.\\
256 - What does she know about towels?\\
257 - Her people dried themselves off by throwing dirt on their backs.\\
258 - Thank you, Piama.\\
259 - Thank you very much.\\
260 - I'm sure\\
261 - the paramedics will come get you very soon,\\
262 - and before they do,\\
263 - there's something I want you to know.\\
264 - Your father had a second family.\\
265 - What?!\\
266 - This slutty cocktail waitress in Manitoba.\\
267 - She was nothing but a pig,\\
268 - and the children that came out of her...\\
269 - Why are you telling me this now?\\
270 - In case you die,\\
271 - I don't want you thinking of him\\
272 - as a decent man,\\
273 - but don't tell your sister.\\
274 - Let her stew in her own ignorance.\\
275 - I only tell this to my favorite.\\
276 - What are you doing?\\
277 - Building calms me down, okay?\\
278 - We're all trying to find ways to cope with this.\\
279 - Yes, Francis, I'm trying to cope with this pregnancy\\
280 - by giving birth!\\
281 - Excuse me. I'm working quietly.\\
282 - I'd appreciate it\\
283 - if  you  could work quietly, too.\\
284 - Got to get out...\\
285 - I gotta get out.\\
286 - I gotta get out.\\
287 - H-Hey!\\
288 - How's it going?\\
289 - You gotta get me out of here.\\
290 - I don't belong in here.\\
291 - I have to get home.\\
292 - It's okay, little fellow. You'll be fine...\\
293 - as long as someone claims you in the next six hours.\\
294 - Six hours? What happens then?\\
295 - Wait! What happens then?!\\
296 - Oh, boys!\\
297 - Boys!\\
298 - Over here. Pick me, pick me.\\
299 - Wow, look at this guy.\\
300 - Yeah!\\
301 - That is the ugliest dog I've ever seen.\\
302 - What did he roll in?\\
303 - I'm gonna be sick.\\
304 - Oh, look at this one.\\
305 - No! No, please come back.\\
306 - Please, please, please!\\
307 - Can someone shut this yappy one up?\\
308 - That's right, Dewey.\\
309 - Come back to Daddy. Pick Daddy.\\
310 - Can we take this one's collar and put it on the good one?\\
311 - Collar?\\
312 - What?\\
313 - No! No!\\
314 - No!\\
315 - No! No! No!\\
316 - My biggest fear... is that I won't be\\
317 - a good big brother.\\
318 - Babies are born stupid\\
319 - and they're really counting on you.\\
320 - They'll touch stuff they shouldn't.\\
321 - They'll eat anything.\\
322 - I'd say half of all our Legos have been through this kid.\\
323 - Probably more.\\
324 - Can I get a new baby?\\
325 - Lois, Let go!\\
326 - Or at least grab his hand!\\
327 - They say that childbirth\\
328 - is the most painful thing a person can go through.\\
329 - With a little light pancake, you could pass.\\
330 - You don't have to hang out with the other ones, you know.\\
331 - Okay, you know what?\\
332 - See, here's the thing...\\
333 - Lady... we're better than you.\\
334 - Every one of us in every way.\\
335 - I'm smarter than you,\\
336 - more educated, and I contribute more to society.\\
337 - I have a family\\
338 - that loves me.\\
339 - I live in a big house,\\
340 - drive a nice car and make more money in a year\\
341 - than you've probably made your whole lifetime.\\
342 - Big deal. So you're a drug dealer.\\
343 - Booga-booga!\\
344 - Hal, where are you?\\
345 - Put the ice on it.\\
346 - The paramedics'll be here any minute,\\
347 - so just hang on.\\
348 - I can't hang on.\\
349 - It doesn't work like that.\\
350 - This baby is coming now.\\
351 - Lois, you don't want to push until you're\\
352 - at least ten centimeters dilated.\\
353 - Well, take a look if you want.\\
354 - Uh... I-I...\\
355 - I'd be happy to look in your mouth.\\
356 - Do you know those animals are in your backyard right now\\
357 - pacing back and forth like it's Africa?\\
358 - When this is my room,\\
359 - they don't come within 20 feet of the door.\\
360 - Oh, I can't believe she's here. I can't believe\\
361 - my sister picked now to have a fight with her.\\
362 - I can't believe I'm going to have\\
363 - to move into the boys' room.\\
364 - Calm down.\\
365 - Does your sister know\\
366 - your mom is dying?\\
367 - What are you talking about?\\
368 - Does your sister know your mother has a fatal disease\\
369 - that she's been hiding\\
370 - and this might be her last chance\\
371 - to make peace?\\
372 - With her mother.\\
373 - Who's dying.\\
374 - Wipe.\\
375 - Cream.\\
376 - Ready.\\
377 - - Done! - Yeah!\\
378 - Number one.\\
379 - In your face!\\
380 - We're just learning\\
381 - how to take care of our babies.\\
382 - That's loser talk.\\
383 - We're gonna be the best big brothers ever.\\
384 - We aced Diaper and we totally owned Tub Time.\\
385 - I'm so glad I memorized\\
386 - all the common household chemicals\\
387 - that can be poisonous to the baby.\\
388 - You know, all this stuff parents have to do...\\
389 - all the feedings and bathings\\
390 - and diaperings\\
391 - and safety stuff and scheduling--\\
392 - just made me realize.\\
393 - Mom never did any of this.\\
394 - There's a bottle of this on our headboard.\\
395 - No wonder we turned out the way we did.\\
396 - It's six months, maybe a year.\\
397 - I'm gonna need that computer.\\
398 - Not today, squirt. Lois is about to have a baby,\\
399 - and I'm in charge of research.\\
400 - She's hot.\\
401 - I can't work with someone looking over my shoulder.\\
402 - Well, I'll see if I can find her.\\
403 - Mother! Telephone!\\
404 - Is the border station going to return my rifle?\\
405 - Hello?\\
406 - Yes?\\
407 - Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that.\\
408 - No, I'm fine.\\
409 - I'm here with you-know-who, and she's doing...\\
410 - you-know-what.\\
411 - Again. Yeah.\\
412 - Where are the paramedics?\\
413 - These contractions are too close to time.\\
414 - Francis, this baby's going to be born any minute.\\
415 - I want you to do something for me.\\
416 - What do you want me to do?\\
417 - I want you to deliver the baby.\\
418 - What?\\
419 - No.\\
420 - You can do it.\\
421 - You've done it before.\\
422 - You deliver barn animals all the time.\\
423 - You're not a barn animal.\\
424 - Francis, your father isn't here;\\
425 - you're the only person I trust.\\
426 - You don't even like me.\\
427 - But I love you, which is why\\
428 - you're going to do this.\\
429 - No! You can't make me!\\
430 - Francis, your mother is asking for your help.\\
431 - Francis.\\
432 - You can do this.\\
433 - You know that you can.\\
434 - Now, you're going to put your hands\\
435 - inside of Mommy and take out\\
436 - this baby!\\
437 - Lois.\\
438 - Oh, Lois.\\
439 - I finally found you.\\
440 - Oh, I missed the baby.\\
441 - It's okay.\\
442 - The baby is fine, Hal.\\
443 - Honey, I'm the worst husband in the world.\\
444 - I can't believe how terrible I am.\\
445 - Oh...\\
446 - I can't believe I made you go through this alone.\\
447 - I wish I could have been there.\\
448 - You were there, Hal.\\
449 - I was?\\
450 - We're a part of each other.\\
451 - Wherever I go, you're there.\\
452 - You are always with me.\\
453 - I love you.\\
454 - Oh, my God, what is that man doing?\\
455 - What?\\
456 - Get that sicko off of her.\\
457 - What? Lois? Are you...?\\
458 - Someone call the police.\\
459 - Dad!\\
460 - Oh, my God!\\
461 - What the hell are you doing?\\
462 - Can you see the head?\\
463 - Not yet.\\
464 - You're not even looking.\\
465 - Is it starting to crown?\\
466 - Uh... yes.\\
467 - That's good. That's good.\\
468 - God, I can't believe\\
469 - I'm looking at... this.\\
470 - I'm going to die.\\
471 - If the head is completely crowning, it's okay to push.\\
472 - If anyone calls, I'll be at your sister's.\\
473 - No, don't worry. I'll let myself out.\\
474 - Come on, Lois. Come on.\\
475 - Ew!\\
476 - Ew!\\
477 - Ew!\\
478 - Was that the...?\\
479 - I got it. I got it.\\
480 - Oh, my God.\\
481 - I got it!\\
482 - Yes!\\
483 - It's here.\\
484 - Put it on her chest.\\
485 - Oh.\\
486 - Hi, baby.\\
487 - Hi.\\
488 - Hi, baby.\\
489 - Oh, thank you, Francis.\\
490 - This is the nicest thing you've ever done for me.\\
491 - I am so proud of you.\\
492 - You can go vomit now.\\
493 - Way to go.\\
494 - Here he comes. There he is.\\
495 - Well, is it\\
496 - a boy or a girl?\\
497 - It's a beautiful, healthy baby...\\
498 - Aw...\\
499 - I knew it!\\
500 - Oh, that's all right.\\
501 - Hi there.\\
502 - I'm your mommy.\\
503 - Okay, so who's having the baby?\\
504 - I told you we shouldn't have stopped for coffee.\\
505 - Oh, I've forgotten how small they are.\\
506 - I forgot how good they smell.\\
507 - Yeah.\\
508 - Okay, hand it over.\\
509 - It's 5:30.\\
510 - It's time for the baby's sponge bath.\\
511 - Look how full this diaper is.\\
512 - When was the last time you changed it?\\
513 - Have you at least come up with a name yet?\\
514 - Yes. Jamie.\\
515 - It fits.\\
516 - We'll come back when your udders are ready.
\subsection {Episode 22: Day Care}
1 - Oh, not  again.\\
2 - This baby... is gonna kill us.\\
3 - Oh, Jamie, for the love of...!\\
4 - It's all over the walls.\\
5 - Boys, it's a level three!\\
6 - Backyard, now!\\
7 - Oh, my God!\\
8 - How does this kid keep getting out of its diaper?\\
9 - Damned if I know.\\
10 - I put that one on with duct tape.\\
11 - Reese, get a mask and bucket and clean up that wall.\\
12 - Malcolm, find the old diaper\\
13 - and bury it at least three feet deep.\\
14 - Dewey, stand by with the garden hose.\\
15 - Oh, we don't have any diapers!\\
16 - How did we go through a bonus pack in one day?\\
17 - Ugh! Jamie just went all over the towel!\\
18 - Dewey, here.... give me your pajama top.\\
19 - Not again!\\
20 - This is my last pair!\\
21 - Let's get you to the shower.\\
22 - God... oh...\\
23 - Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait.\\
24 - Ugh, it's in my hair!\\
25 -     Life is unfair.    \\
26 - Yes, I was checking our status at the day care center.\\
27 - What? How do you move  down on the waiting list?\\
28 - Those are juvenile offenses\\
29 - and shouldn't be part of the public record!\\
30 - Hal, what are we going to do?\\
31 - My maternity leave is over,\\
32 - I go back to work tomorrow,\\
33 - and we still haven't found day care for Jamie.\\
34 - Well, honey, maybe you'll have to just...\\
35 - stay out a little longer.\\
36 - I know money is tight, but...\\
37 - we can always\\
38 - stretch our pennies a little more.\\
39 - This is insane.\\
40 - There is no juice left in there.\\
41 - You are watering down  water.\\
42 - All right, we're desperate!\\
43 - But there has to be some decent day care program\\
44 - we can afford.\\
45 - Now, where the hell haven't we looked?\\
46 - We're joining a church?\\
47 - We don't know anything about these people.\\
48 - They have the best staffed co-op nursery in town,\\
49 - and they'll take care of Jamie for free.\\
50 - So, as far as these people know, we've been practicing members\\
51 - of the Brethren of Calvary for years, you understand?\\
52 - Why doesn't Malcolm have to be here?\\
53 - Would you rather be doing his job right now?\\
54 - Ow, ow, ow! Let go, let go!\\
55 - What if they ask me to pray?\\
56 - I don't know how to pray.\\
57 - Look, they only want to meet us.\\
58 - So for the next half hour, as far as you're concerned,\\
59 - God is the greatest thing in the universe,\\
60 - and that's that.\\
61 - Hello, everyone. I'm Pastor Roy.\\
62 - I understand you want to transfer\\
63 - your membership from the Brethren in Danville?\\
64 - Yes. We were longtime members in Danville.\\
65 - I didn't know we had a church in Danville.\\
66 - It's gone now, bought out by a strip club.\\
67 - Really?\\
68 - Well, it's not all nude.\\
69 - It's just topless with tassels, but still...\\
70 - We just  so  want to continue\\
71 - to be part of the Brethren community.\\
72 - "Community." I love that word.\\
73 - And our branch is very active.\\
74 - I'm sure the boys will enjoy Bible study.\\
75 - Oh, I'm sure they will. And of course,\\
76 - we also have hayrides, retreats, prayer breakfasts...\\
77 - Day care? Day care...\\
78 - Really? Lois, did you hear that?\\
79 - They have day care. I did not know that.\\
80 - That kind of service is why we have always\\
81 - been so committed to this church.\\
82 - That's wonderful.\\
83 - Have you gone through the Precepts of the Covenant?\\
84 - Yes. Of course.\\
85 - Love the Precepts.\\
86 - Number three has gotten me through some hard times.\\
87 - But it always comes back to God, huh?\\
88 - Yeah, God's pretty neat.\\
89 - Yeah, he's totally my favorite of all them.\\
90 - I promise I will hire you back\\
91 - just as soon as business picks up.\\
92 - I've never seen it this slow, Otto.\\
93 - That makes six employees laid off in one week.\\
94 - It is that festival down at Roswell.\\
95 - All of the tourists are going--\\
96 - to see where the UFOs landed.\\
97 - Our people are losing their jobs\\
98 - 'cause a bunch of idiot tourists think little green men\\
99 - crashed a spaceship down there?\\
100 - That's ridiculous. Ja.\\
101 - They will see nothing down there.\\
102 - The government put every scrap of evidence\\
103 - in a secret vault 50 years ago.\\
104 - Is this the news desk?\\
105 - Listen, I'm out at the Grotto Ranch,\\
106 - and... oh, my God, there it is again!\\
107 - There's something weird\\
108 - happening in the sky!\\
109 - I see a light and some kind of craft.\\
110 - You'd better get out here\\
111 - right away!\\
112 - I suppose it could be out here for another 20 minutes,\\
113 - but you'd better hurry!\\
114 - Hi, Donna, we're here.\\
115 - Oh, hi, Lois.\\
116 - This must be your little angel.\\
117 - There, there.\\
118 - I don't know what got into Jamie this morning.\\
119 - This is  so  out of the ordinary!\\
120 - There, there, pumpkin. When'd you get so fussy?\\
121 - Well, sometimes even the youngest babies\\
122 - can sense your anxiety on the first day.\\
123 - Yeah, that must be it.\\
124 - Uh, I expressed some breast milk.\\
125 - Oh, my.\\
126 - I come from a long line of milkers.\\
127 - Once these get started, there's no stopping them.\\
128 - Whoa, this is so unusual!\\
129 - At home we forget we even have a baby.\\
130 - Bye-bye, sweetheart.\\
131 - We're going to get along great here, aren't we, precious?\\
132 - Now, I know a lot of the mothers like to hang around for a while\\
133 - on the first day, but we think it's...\\
134 - I'm still waiting for a price... Here's your change. Thank you.\\
135 - - That's not the right ointment! - What's wrong with you?!\\
136 - You said you wanted the do-it-yourself applicator,\\
137 - you crazy old man!\\
138 - You think you're getting out of helping me with this?!\\
139 - You're my wife!\\
140 - Ooh. Ooh!\\
141 - Has it always been this quiet here?\\
142 - And the best part is, when you play with God,\\
143 - it's always your turn.\\
144 - What does the "T" on the wall stand for?\\
145 - Uh, we'll talk about that later.\\
146 - Hal, I have to meet a parishioner in my office.\\
147 - Would you mind continuing the lesson?\\
148 - What, me? Don't worry.\\
149 - It's just the story of Daniel and the lions.\\
150 - I'm sure you know it in your sleep.\\
151 - Uh...\\
152 - Okay, then, class.\\
153 - Uh...\\
154 - this is a story about a man named Daniel,\\
155 - and, apparently, some lions, so...\\
156 - Um...\\
157 - "Uh, it-it pleased Darius\\
158 - "to set over the kingdom\\
159 - "120 princes,\\
160 - "which should be over the whole kingdom,\\
161 - "and over these three officials,\\
162 - uh, uh, of whom Daniel was first..."\\
163 - When do the lions show up?\\
164 - Soon, Dewey.\\
165 - Please, you just have to be a little patient.\\
166 - Ooh! Ooh!\\
167 - "Uh, uh, and Darius said to Daniel,\\
168 - "'Yea, verily, I smote you,\\
169 - "and I send thee to be thrown into the den.'\\
170 - "Where soon,\\
171 - Daniel was eaten by the lions."\\
172 - I thought God saved him.\\
173 - Oh.\\
174 - Well, sure.\\
175 - I was getting to that.\\
176 - Uh, as, as it is written...\\
177 - the lion dith spit him up...\\
178 - ...along with a lamb.\\
179 - A talking lamb.\\
180 - "And verily,\\
181 - "it came to pass\\
182 - "that the big lump in the middle of the boa constrictor\\
183 - "turned out to be\\
184 - "the missing ranger.\\
185 - "Forasmuch as the multitudes could still hear his radio\\
186 - "saying unto them,\\
187 - "Come in, Dave. Dave, do you read me?"\\
188 -     No need to go up to Lover's Lane    \\
189 -     And come back down    \\
190 -     All full of shame    \\
191 -     I'll smile as I sing the same refrain    \\
192 -     Abstain, abstain, abstain!    \\
193 - Oh!\\
194 - Well, we really shook the rafters, didn't we?\\
195 - I think Pastor Roy\\
196 - might call the cops on us.\\
197 - Yes, Reese?\\
198 - Is there some kind of\\
199 - loyalty oath I can sign so I can get out of here?\\
200 - Reese, no one's forcing you to stay.\\
201 - The only thing keeping you here\\
202 - is that little voice in your head that keeps saying,\\
203 - "Why are all these people so much happier than me?"\\
204 - Now, then, as you know,\\
205 - Mrs. Pitzer, the church secretary,\\
206 - suffered a paralyzing spider bite\\
207 - at last summer's faith retreat,\\
208 - but out of that tragedy\\
209 - has come these wonderful inspirational scenes\\
210 - that she paints with her mouth.\\
211 - Here's Elijah being taken up to Heaven\\
212 - in his fiery chariot;\\
213 - Jonah and the whale;\\
214 - the parting\\
215 - of the Red Sea...\\
216 - It's a joyful thing to witness the way\\
217 - God has blessed this woman's tongue and teeth.\\
218 -     I don't need no evil weed    \\
219 - Oh, man. Wow.\\
220 -     Keep your crack and your LSD    \\
221 -     I'm snorting something    \\
222 -     That God gave me    \\
223 -     And it smells a lot like love...    \\
224 - Mom, I don't want to go to that class.\\
225 - You see this paycheck?\\
226 - I earned this because we have day care.\\
227 - Those who earn paychecks get to have an opinion.\\
228 - Those who don't go to Bible school.\\
229 - Hal, three serious diapers on the way home.\\
230 - We have to burn the car seat.\\
231 - Dad, talk to her.\\
232 - I don't want to go to this class.\\
233 - Malcolm, you have to give this church a chance.\\
234 - I understand it's a little different\\
235 - from what we're used to,\\
236 - but I opened up to the experience,\\
237 - and I feel a real spiritual connection.\\
238 - How's it looking, Hal? Great.\\
239 - See you got the windows framed in.\\
240 - We all find our own path...\\
241 - our own way.\\
242 - I don't like the way it feels either,\\
243 - but I don't have any more blouses, you little miracle.\\
244 - If you could just, for the love of God, stop crying.\\
245 - Hi, Donna.\\
246 - Oh, don't tell me\\
247 - Jamie's been carrying on again.\\
248 - You sure have a high-spirited little one.\\
249 - Yeah, I guess I do.\\
250 - Thanks for everything.\\
251 - All right, dear.\\
252 - Oh, and are you going to be picking up Seth,\\
253 - or should he be dropped off?\\
254 - Seth? Who's Seth?\\
255 - You're babysitting Seth Richards.\\
256 - It's been on the schedule for two weeks.\\
257 - See? Saturday, Lois has Seth.\\
258 - You don't understand.\\
259 - I'm one of those people who drops kids  off  at the co-op.\\
260 - I don't watch them. I work.\\
261 - We all take turns sitting.\\
262 - That's what "co-op" means.\\
263 - But I thought this one of those churches where, you know,\\
264 - people felt good doing things for other people\\
265 - who don't have to do anything back.\\
266 - I have to work tomorrow.\\
267 - I'm sorry, but you're going\\
268 - to have to figure out something else.\\
269 - Seth, you have got to get out of there!\\
270 - This is my fort!\\
271 - I'll be with you in a minute.\\
272 - I have to admit, I was a doubter.\\
273 - But I guess we're pretty lucky\\
274 - to get a visit from an actual UFO.\\
275 - Yeah, yeah, but look at me.\\
276 - I am still shaking from seeing that craft with my own two eyes.\\
277 - I tell you, they spoke to me telepathically.\\
278 - There's been another sighting!\\
279 - The alien's moved down to the Songbird Ranch.\\
280 - They actually have a piece of landing gear.\\
281 - What?\\
282 - No, they don't.\\
283 - They're lying.\\
284 - Otto, we can't let these people...\\
285 - For your own safety,\\
286 - do not wave at them.\\
287 - They think our hands\\
288 - are sex organs.\\
289 - You may start something you won't want to finish.\\
290 - What?\\
291 - I love you.\\
292 - Stop saying that.\\
293 - Ever since we joined this church,\\
294 - you've been acting really weird.\\
295 - That's because I'm a different Reese.\\
296 - I was sitting in Bible class dead,\\
297 - when suddenly I was awakened.\\
298 - I'm dedicated to something outside myself now.\\
299 - Something wonderful.\\
300 - Now come here.\\
301 - Can't you just hit me like you used to?\\
302 - I'm just too happy.\\
303 - It's beautiful.\\
304 - You painted it and everything.\\
305 - Welcome home, Hal.\\
306 - I am so overwhelmed by this.\\
307 - And I'm not just blowing smoke this time.\\
308 - You are the best.\\
309 - God bless you all.\\
310 - I think you're charging me for your own soda.\\
311 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
312 - That kid has me so frazzled.\\
313 - I mean... Where is he?\\
314 - Lois, for the love of God,\\
315 - are you watching this kid or not?\\
316 - Where did you find him?\\
317 - Under a car\\
318 - sharing his candy bar with a squirrel.\\
319 - He didn't like it. He's sick.\\
320 - Lois, I am trying out\\
321 - a less supportive undergarment.\\
322 - I can't be chasing this boy all around the store.\\
323 - Why don't you just leave him in your car\\
324 - like the other bad mothers do?\\
325 - Mrs. Munson,\\
326 - I want you to release my brother.\\
327 - What?\\
328 - Ever since Reese\\
329 - got in your class, he's been really nice to me.\\
330 - Trust me-- it's creepy.\\
331 - I don't like this church.\\
332 - Ever since we came here, all I do is think about stuff.\\
333 - What kind of God makes children think\\
334 - when they're not even in school?\\
335 - Well, now, see, that is a torment,\\
336 - but I'm sure He has His reasons.\\
337 - Yeah, like Pastor Roy said.\\
338 - How God's so much bigger and wiser than us\\
339 - and trying to see what he's thinking\\
340 - would be like an ant trying to see what I'm thinking.\\
341 - Yes, exactly.\\
342 - But we can trust in His wisdom\\
343 - and we can have faith that He is watching over us.\\
344 - Like me with the anthill in my backyard.\\
345 - I spent days watching the ants, trying to figure out\\
346 - which ones were good and which ones were bad.\\
347 - But they all just\\
348 - looked like ants,\\
349 - so I started smiting all of them.\\
350 - Well, that's not...\\
351 - I was smiting them with the garden hose\\
352 - and with lighter fluid and with the lawn mower,\\
353 - and to be perfectly honest,\\
354 - I think I went a little crazy with the shovel.\\
355 - Those ants\\
356 - could have been praying to me all day,\\
357 - I wouldn't have heard them.\\
358 - There was nothing they could do about it.\\
359 - But I don't think...\\
360 - Really, it's the same with us.\\
361 - There's nothing we can do about anything, either.\\
362 - So why worry about it?\\
363 - Hey, this is making me feel better.\\
364 - Well, that's... good, but...\\
365 - I guess all we can do is live our lives\\
366 - with as much kindness\\
367 - and decency as possible\\
368 - and try not to dwell on God standing over us\\
369 - with that giant shovel.\\
370 - Bye.\\
371 - That was $50 worth of makeup.\\
372 - Am I pretty? No, you are not pretty.\\
373 - You have caused me an enormous amount of trouble\\
374 - and I have had it, you hear me?\\
375 - Seth?\\
376 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\\
377 - Is he...\\
378 - Are you from the co-op?\\
379 - Yes, yes, I am.\\
380 - And I suppose that this might look a little odd,\\
381 - but in my defense, I didn't realize\\
382 - I'd have to take care of a kid today...\\
383 - a child... a, um...\\
384 - a little person.\\
385 - What are pleasure dots?\\
386 - Oh, my Lord.\\
387 - Seth,\\
388 - you come away from that woman this instant.\\
389 - He did some nice coloring.\\
390 - What the hell are you doing?\\
391 - What does it look like I'm doing?\\
392 - What kind of alien are you?\\
393 - You don't even glow in the dark.\\
394 - Get out of here.\\
395 - You get out of here. You get out of here.\\
396 - You get out of here.\\
397 - You get...\\
398 - Hal, I had a terrible day with that child.\\
399 - Oh, honey, I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.\\
400 - I just got back from an all-day\\
401 - hayride committee meeting.\\
402 - Do you know there are six different kinds of hay\\
403 - and they all have their promoters.\\
404 - Hal, listen to me.\\
405 - It was impossible at work with that child,\\
406 - but I kept thinking, "I don't have a choice.\\
407 - I have to do this for Jamie."\\
408 - And then the parents came and there was\\
409 - this ugly thing, and then\\
410 - I saw this.\\
411 - Hey, this is good coloring.\\
412 - It's baby Moses in the bullrushes.\\
413 - And I started to think about that story,\\
414 - where the mother has to take her little one\\
415 - and send him down the river forever\\
416 - to be raised by someone else.\\
417 - And I wanted to be that mom.\\
418 - Hal... I don't like this baby.\\
419 - Are you serious?\\
420 - I know it's terrible.\\
421 - I don't deserve to be a mother.\\
422 - I'm supposed to be feeling all this perfect\\
423 - motherly love, and it's not there.\\
424 - It is just not there.\\
425 - I can't believe you're saying this.\\
426 - I know it's horrible.\\
427 - You really don't remember, do you?\\
428 - Remember what?\\
429 - Honey, you've hated all our babies.\\
430 - You couldn't stand\\
431 - the sight of any of them for at least two months.\\
432 - What? Well, Reese, six months,\\
433 - but he was a nipple-biter, so I didn't blame you.\\
434 - You told me\\
435 - to leave Francis at the county fair\\
436 - so he could be raised by cows.\\
437 - Oh, my God.\\
438 - It's just that you're so tired\\
439 - and, I mean, this all seems so overwhelming,\\
440 - but believe me, in a few weeks you are going to love this baby\\
441 - as much as anyone has ever loved a baby.\\
442 - Really?\\
443 - Yeah.\\
444 - Hey, I don't hear anything.\\
445 - Where is the baby?\\
446 - Sleeping quietly.\\
447 - Been that way for an hour.\\
448 - Oh, my goodness.\\
449 - How precious.\\
450 - Who couldn't love something like that?\\
451 - Do we have to keep the painting?\\
452 - No.\\
453 - We just have to find an atheist handyman.\\
454 - Come, it's time.\\
455 - It all became clear to me that first day in church.\\
456 - And now that everything\\
457 - has been carefully prepared,\\
458 - this will be the most magnificent day\\
459 - of my life.\\
460 - What are you doing?\\
461 - I plan to float above the clouds\\
462 - and experience the joy that only birds can know.\\
463 - You're going to fry yourself on a high-voltage wire.\\
464 - I'm not afraid.\\
465 - I have faith in my vision.\\
466 - I love you, Dewey.\\
467 - This is incredible.\\
468 - I can see the top of Dad's car from here.\\
469 - I'll miss you at first.\\
470 - No, I'm as surprised as you are.\\
471 - No, I'm as  surprised  as you are.\\
472 - No, I'm as surprised as  you  are.\\
473 -     Amazing race    \\
474 -     How sweet the taste    \\
475 -     That saved a wrench for me    \\
476 -     I once was in the lost and found    \\
477 -     Was blind, but found my keys.    \\
478 -     My face...    \\
479 - The United States government is not happy\\
480 - with the level of interest you've created in this sector.\\
481 - But what's the harm\\
482 - in pretending I'm from another planet?\\
483 - I mean, all that UFO stuff\\
484 - about abductions and cavity probes,\\
485 - that's all made up.\\
486 - Right?\\
487 - Yes, there are no aliens.\\
488 - But there are cavity probes.\\
489 - But you just joined us two weeks ago.\\
490 - Believe me, you do not want us to be part of your church.\\
491 - We really don't belong around civilized people.\\
492 - Oh, come now. I'm sure that's just a...\\
493 - See, that's exactly\\
494 - the kind of thing we're talking about.
