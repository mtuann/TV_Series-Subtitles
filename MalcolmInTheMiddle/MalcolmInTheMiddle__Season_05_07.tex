\subsection {Episode 01: Vegas}
1 - Goo-goo-goo-goo. Goo-goo-goo-goo.\\
2 - Look. Your Aunt Felicia\\
3 - sent us two presents for the baby.\\
4 - A ballerina outfit and a football?\\
5 - Well, I guess she's hedging her bets.\\
6 - I mean, Jamie could be a name for either sex.\\
7 - Well, I guess I'll just send this one to Goodwill.\\
8 - Oh, that's ridiculous.\\
9 - The birth announcement clearly said that Jamie's a... Hey.\\
10 - They changed the little dinosaur.\\
11 - That's right. All it takes is one look\\
12 - to see that Jamie is clearly a...\\
13 - Reese! For crying out loud!\\
14 - How can anyone not know what you are?\\
15 - Ooh-ooh.\\
16 - Nice try, mister.\\
17 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
18 -     I don't know    \\
19 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     Life is unfair.    \\
29 - Come on, Gordo. One more bite and it's all gone.\\
30 - What are you doing with my rabbit?\\
31 - Just giving him his afternoon bacon.\\
32 - He's too fat.\\
33 - You have to stop feeding him.\\
34 - I'm the one who has to sit\\
35 - through the Junior Farmers' meetings\\
36 - while everyone makes fun of him.\\
37 - Those people are small-minded idiots\\
38 - who have no idea what we're trying to do.\\
39 - What  are  we trying to do?\\
40 - I don't know.\\
41 - I kind of had this vision\\
42 - of me riding him through town,\\
43 - knocking over cars,\\
44 - but that's probably not realistic.\\
45 - What happened to you?\\
46 - Some idiot forgot to top off the oil\\
47 - in the tractor, and the whole damn engine blew.\\
48 - Well, whose job is that?\\
49 - Mine. I'm telling you,\\
50 - this whole ranch is a disaster.\\
51 - The furnace is clogged.\\
52 - The generator's out of diesel.\\
53 - Even the gate to the cow pen is falling apart.\\
54 - All those things are your responsibility.\\
55 - I don't know what's going on with you lately,\\
56 - but you'd better get it together.\\
57 - Otto's a pretty easygoing boss, but even he has limits.\\
58 - Fire! Fire! Francis, is a fire!\\
59 - What? Where?\\
60 - Right here on your cake.\\
61 - God, it's been a year already?\\
62 - As of 9/31.\\
63 - So far, your first three hours of year two\\
64 - are going much better than I ever could have hoped.\\
65 - Ooh!\\
66 - Congratulations.\\
67 - You won the jackpot.\\
68 - Oh, my God, would you look at this?\\
69 - What does Reese do to his underpants?\\
70 - There's not enough money in the world to make me look up.\\
71 - What's this?\\
72 - "Certificate of Achievement\\
73 - for Excellence in Science"?\\
74 - From the state?\\
75 - It's nothing. They hand\\
76 - these out like candy.\\
77 - Don't be so modest.\\
78 - It's wonderful,\\
79 - and I think it proves my point\\
80 - about you not getting that earring.\\
81 - How does that...? Malcolm.\\
82 - Malcolm, I need to talk to you.\\
83 - You read all those science magazines.\\
84 - What can you tell me\\
85 - about the meaning of dreams?\\
86 - Dreams?\\
87 - Well, some people think they express\\
88 - your subconscious wishes...\\
89 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
90 - The other kind of dreams,\\
91 - prophetic ones that predict the future.\\
92 - I had one.\\
93 - About a giant slot machine.\\
94 - That's insane, Dad.\\
95 - Oh, it was so vivid.\\
96 - There, there was this mysterious stain on my shirt\\
97 - an-and a balloon, and then this music\\
98 - and then I hit this gigantic jackpot.\\
99 - It was a sign, son. I know it.\\
100 - It's my destiny.\\
101 - Dad.\\
102 - You have weird dreams all the time.\\
103 - Like the singing trash cans.\\
104 - I never said that was prophetic.\\
105 - I said it was cool.\\
106 - Well?\\
107 - What did they think of Gordo?\\
108 - They called him a monster.\\
109 - Then they called me a crime against nature.\\
110 - Maybe it was the other way around.\\
111 - All I remember is, I was crying.\\
112 - You have to expect this kind of resistance when you're trying to play God.\\
113 - Just wait till we get to the nationals. Then we'll get some respect.\\
114 - We're not going to the nationals!\\
115 - They're all the way in Las Vegas!\\
116 - Las Vegas?!\\
117 - What's in Las Vegas?\\
118 - A chance for Reese to make me look\\
119 - like a jerk in front of the entire country.\\
120 - Well, don't you worry, son.\\
121 - We won't miss that.\\
122 - Of course we'll go to Vegas!\\
123 - Did you hear that, Malcolm? This is another sign!\\
124 - All I have to do is cash in our life insurance policy\\
125 - to pay for the trip...\\
126 - Dad, are you sure you want to...?\\
127 - Son, you don't need life insurance\\
128 - when you're a kajillionaire.\\
129 - It doesn't make fiscal sense.\\
130 - Maybe you want to run your plan by Mom first.\\
131 - I will. I will.\\
132 - I just want to be careful about it.\\
133 - But if I explain it\\
134 - in just the right way...\\
135 - A $1,000 bonus from work.\\
136 - Hal, I am so proud of you.\\
137 - Hey, considering the $12 million I saved them\\
138 - with my idea for\\
139 - outsourcing flux capacitors,\\
140 - it was the least they can do.\\
141 - And part of that roast is for you, Malcolm...\\
142 - Mr. State Science Achievement.\\
143 - Yeah, it, it was nothing.\\
144 - Is that what that big ceremony\\
145 - at school was for?\\
146 - Reese!\\
147 - What ceremony? There was a ceremony?\\
148 - Yeah, the mayor was there,\\
149 - and we all got out of school.\\
150 - Stop kicking me!\\
151 - I'll get to the news crew in a second.\\
152 - Malcolm, how could you not\\
153 - tell us about something so important?\\
154 - We're your parents!\\
155 - You're overreacting. It wasn't a big deal.\\
156 - That's not for you to decide!\\
157 - How can you be so selfish?\\
158 - I wasn't being selfish.\\
159 - I just didn't want you there\\
160 - because you em...\\
161 - ..barrass...\\
162 - Abort! Abort!\\
163 - ...me.\\
164 - Oh.\\
165 - Okay.\\
166 - At least I know.\\
167 - Give Gordo your fat.\\
168 - Hey, Mom,\\
169 - do you want the rest of my milk shake?\\
170 - It's really good.\\
171 - No, thanks. I'm fine.\\
172 - It's strawberry.\\
173 - I know that's your favorite.\\
174 - I'll take that.\\
175 - Hal, look!\\
176 - Boone Vincent\\
177 - is playing in Las Vegas.\\
178 - Who's Boone Vincent?\\
179 - Your mom's boyfriend.\\
180 - Stop it.\\
181 - You would not believe\\
182 - this jackass, boys.\\
183 - Women go crazy for him.\\
184 - He plays every instrument in the orchestra.\\
185 - He sings in four languages.\\
186 - And you like him just as much as I do!\\
187 - Oh, please, I just said that\\
188 - to get you into bed.\\
189 - That... when, that time you were so sick\\
190 - and you needed your rest.\\
191 - Hey, check it out!\\
192 - Only eight more miles to Vegas! Hey!\\
193 - Hal, look at this place.\\
194 - It's so classy.\\
195 - What's the matter?\\
196 - Never seen an 80-pound rabbit before?\\
197 - Uh-oh.\\
198 - Got a little spit-up.\\
199 - Here...\\
200 - Oh... honey, do you have a little, uh..\\
201 - Oh.\\
202 - Oh, my God! That's the one!\\
203 - Yes! I knew it!\\
204 - Oh, my God, Hal. You won the jackpot!\\
205 - I can't believe it!\\
206 - So, Malcolm?\\
207 - What do you and your science have to say now?\\
208 - We say you're having another dream, Dad.\\
209 - Don't believe him. This is real.\\
210 -     We wouldn't lie to you.    \\
211 - I can't hear you, Otto. There's too much static.\\
212 - And yelling won't help.\\
213 - Yes, Otto, I know about the well.\\
214 - I was going to fence it off last week.\\
215 - I just didn't get around to it.\\
216 - Otto, I can't hear you.\\
217 - I will fence off the well as soon as I find it.\\
218 - Aah!\\
219 - Can you hear me now?\\
220 - My God, look at these puny rabbits.\\
221 - What do people do with them?\\
222 - I don't know.\\
223 - Maybe love them and hug them\\
224 - and watch them hop around the backyard,\\
225 - which they can do because their feet can touch the ground.\\
226 - I bet Gordo could fit that one in his mouth.\\
227 - Hey, Mom, I... Did you find your father?\\
228 - No. I-I wasn't... Well, it doesn't matter.\\
229 - I went through his wallet when we passed the state line.\\
230 - Let's see how much damage he can do\\
231 - with $20 and a library card.\\
232 - Okay, look, since you're obviously too caught up\\
233 - in playing the martyr here to even listen to an apology,\\
234 - you've forced me to go out and get these.\\
235 - They're for that stupid Boone Vincent guy.\\
236 - We're going together.\\
237 - Hey, that came out better than I thought.\\
238 - VIP seats?!\\
239 - Hi, my name is Dewey and this is my...\\
240 - Good Lord!\\
241 - What have you done to this poor animal?\\
242 - In all my years of judging rabbits,\\
243 - this is the uncutest thing I have ever seen.\\
244 - You should be ashamed of yourself.\\
245 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my...!\\
246 - Help us!\\
247 - We have fallen down a well and we can't get out!\\
248 - If there is anyone up there\\
249 - who is just very shy, do not worry!\\
250 - We are not judgmental!\\
251 - As a matter of fact, when I was a little boy...\\
252 - Otto, please!\\
253 - No one can hear you.\\
254 - This is not productive.\\
255 - Can we just... Can we think for a second?\\
256 - Don't you ever blink?\\
257 - Maybe I blink at the precise moment that you blink!\\
258 - That is ridiculous! How could you possibly know that?\\
259 - Why don't you spend less time worrying about my blinking\\
260 - and more time fencing up wells!\\
261 - Germans hate dying in wells!\\
262 - Fine! If you are so unhappy with the work I do around here,\\
263 - then I quit!\\
264 - Imagine I stormed off!\\
265 - I did.\\
266 - Oh, my God. I can't believe it.\\
267 - We're going to see Boone Vincent.\\
268 - Look at these seats!\\
269 - This is incredible!\\
270 - Another Boone-a-tic, I see.\\
271 - The Bad Boone Rising tour, were you there?\\
272 - I had floor seats when he had his first heart attack.\\
273 - These are my sons.\\
274 - This is Malcolm and this is Jamie.\\
275 - Oh, my Joey is here with me, too.\\
276 - Maybe the boys can sit together.\\
277 - Two apricot sours. Oh!\\
278 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
279 - prepare yourselves for the voice that is America.\\
280 - It's Boone...!\\
281 -     I'm coming up    \\
282 -     So you'd better get the party started...    \\
283 -      He's coming up, he's coming     \\
284 -     I'm coming up    \\
285 -     So you'd better get the party started    \\
286 -     Get this party started on a Saturday night    \\
287 -     Everybody's waiting for me to arrive    \\
288 -     I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings    \\
289 -     I can go for miles, if you know what I mean...    \\
290 - The worst part is, this is my first concert.\\
291 -     I'm coming up...    \\
292 - Those aren't for you! Pass 'em up!\\
293 -      He's coming up, he's coming     \\
294 -     I'm coming up...    \\
295 - Have you ever had a dream that didn't come true?\\
296 - Surprisingly, no.\\
297 - Dewey, where have you been?\\
298 - Hi, Reese. This is Crystal.\\
299 - It turns out we had Gordo in the wrong category.\\
300 - We had him in the pet rabbit competition,\\
301 - when he should have been in the market rabbit competition.\\
302 - I took him over there, and he won first place!\\
303 - What?\\
304 - Some guy named Chez Richard\\
305 - bought him for $1.90 a pound.\\
306 - We made like 150 bucks!\\
307 - Chez Richard?!\\
308 - That's the restaurant!\\
309 - How could you do that?!\\
310 - They're going to kill him and eat him!\\
311 - Don't you understand?\\
312 - He was my best friend in the whole world!\\
313 - Mine, too.\\
314 - It's all right, sugar.\\
315 - My best friend got killed in a restaurant.\\
316 - You'll get over it eventually.\\
317 -     Papa don't preach    \\
318 -     I'm in trouble deep    \\
319 -     Papa don't preach    \\
320 -     I've been losing sleep    \\
321 -     But I've made up my mind    \\
322 -     She's keeping my baby    \\
323 -      We're keeping his baby     \\
324 - Cry, scream, projectile vomit!\\
325 - Do something to get us out of here!\\
326 - Excuse me. Excuse me.\\
327 - Mr. Vincent appreciates your enthusiasm.\\
328 - He wonders if you'd like to come backstage and meet him.\\
329 - Oh, my...\\
330 - Oh, my God, you get to see the "Booney Bin!"\\
331 -     I'm in trouble deep...    \\
332 - I bet you won't be too embarrassed\\
333 - to tell your friends about this.\\
334 -     Please, Papa! Please, Papa!    \\
335 -     No, Papa! No, Papa!    \\
336 - Okay.\\
337 - I'll cause a distraction.\\
338 - You go in the kitchen and get Gordo.\\
339 - Oh, my God. This boy's choking!\\
340 - You're not doing it hard enough.\\
341 - Ugh!\\
342 - Move, I'm bigger.\\
343 - Ugh!\\
344 - Ow!\\
345 - Once again, we're very sorry about all the trouble we caused.\\
346 - I know there's no way we can make up\\
347 - for the broken tables,\\
348 - or the paramedics, or the fire,\\
349 - or the guy that was really choking that nobody noticed.\\
350 - He touched my shoulder!\\
351 - I can't believe this is actually happening!\\
352 - I can smell his cologne out here!\\
353 - Oh, my God, I'm next.\\
354 - Does my hair look okay?\\
355 - Compared to his?\\
356 - Hello, sweetheart. Thank you for your support.\\
357 - It means so much to me.\\
358 - No, thank you for your music.\\
359 - Especially, um, "Cinnamon Rainbow."\\
360 - That is my all-time favorite.\\
361 - Really?\\
362 - Mine, too,\\
363 - but no one's ever told me that before.\\
364 - Come in.\\
365 - I'm going in. I don't care what I see.\\
366 - Yes, I do. Who am I kidding?\\
367 - You mean he actually said\\
368 - he didn't want you at his awards ceremony?\\
369 - I can handle his being mad at me, but this was...\\
370 - Right to the old love pump.\\
371 - That's how I got to see your show.\\
372 - My son bought tickets to try to make it up to me.\\
373 - That's not an olive branch.\\
374 - That's the whole damn tree.\\
375 - Ah, it's like I say\\
376 - when I'm in the astronaut suit...\\
377 - "I believe the children are our future."\\
378 - I do, too.\\
379 - You can't really take\\
380 - what they say too seriously.\\
381 - They're teenagers.\\
382 - I'll let you in on a little secret, Lois...\\
383 - Even my 14-year-old is embarrassed by me.\\
384 - No. I know.\\
385 - Hard to believe, isn't it?\\
386 - But you can't hold onto the past, Lois.\\
387 - You've got to live in the here and now.\\
388 - Because the here and now\\
389 - is a special, special gift.\\
390 - That's why I call it...\\
391 - the present.\\
392 - Otto.\\
393 - Oh, are you still here? I thought you quit.\\
394 - You were right.\\
395 - This is my fault.\\
396 - For some reason,\\
397 - I've been sabotaging everything lately.\\
398 - Knowing that I've been here for a year,\\
399 - it's like people are depending on me now.\\
400 - And I know that at some point, I'm going to let them down.\\
401 - Don't be ridiculous.\\
402 - No one...\\
403 - expects you to be perfect.\\
404 - If I wanted perfection\\
405 - I would have hired a robot or a Swede,\\
406 - but I hired you, Francis,\\
407 - because you're smart, you're a hard worker,\\
408 - and when you make a mistake, you fix it.\\
409 - If falling down a well every once in a while\\
410 - is the price I must pay to have you, so be it.\\
411 - Thanks, Otto.\\
412 - There you are!\\
413 - Thank God!\\
414 - How did you find us?\\
415 - We just followed the fire.\\
416 - What fire?\\
417 - One of the cows got through the gate you didn't fix.\\
418 - And it knocked over\\
419 - one of the heat lamps you never took in.\\
420 - Which set fire to the trail of gasoline\\
421 - from the open can in the back of your truck.\\
422 - Which, by the way, also is on fire.\\
423 - Ah, you see, Francis?\\
424 - You thought you were a screwup.\\
425 - 90,000 slot machines and not one of them right.\\
426 - I am never trusting a prophetic dream again.\\
427 - Thanks again, Malcolm.\\
428 - Don't tell your father,\\
429 - but meeting Boone Vincent actually made my knees...\\
430 - Aah! No-no-no-no-no-no...\\
431 - Hal! What the...? I found you!\\
432 - It's all here!\\
433 - Would you like a free pull, sir?\\
434 - Yes, I would.\\
435 - Oh!\\
436 - I knew it!\\
437 - Hal, what is the matter?\\
438 - It's fate, Lois!\\
439 - I knew this would happen!\\
440 - I couldn't tell you because\\
441 - I knew you would be too closed-minded.\\
442 - I cashed in our life insurance for this,\\
443 - but it all paid off!\\
444 - We are rich!\\
445 - You did what?!\\
446 - Congratulations, sir.\\
447 - What's this?\\
448 - It's a coupon for a two-night stay\\
449 - at the Carson City Breezeway Motel.\\
450 - All you have to do is listen\\
451 - to a four-hour presentation\\
452 - about a wonderful time-share opportunity.\\
453 - Do they have slot machines in Carson City?\\
454 - Come on, Gordo.\\
455 - You have to eat the pellets.\\
456 - You can't have any fattening food anymore.\\
457 - Please, Gordo, you've got\\
458 - to try one...\\
459 - Ow!\\
460 - I cut my finger.\\
461 - He's eating.\\
462 - I think he likes your blood.\\
463 - Okay, if I black out, pull my finger out of his mouth.\\
464 - So, ten hours of stony silence?\\
465 - I may have some thoughts I feel like sharing.\\
466 - I'll let you know.\\
467 - Well, this trip wasn't a total loss.\\
468 - At least I...\\
469 - It was a total loss.\\
470 - The good news is, the survival mechanism\\
471 - in my brain is kicking in.\\
472 - I'm already starting to block out\\
473 - what happened this weekend.\\
474 -     I feel like making love    \\
475 -     Feel like making love...    \\
476 -     Feel like making love to you    \\
477 -     Ooh.    
\subsection {Episode 02: Watching the Baby}
1 - Finally Mama's going to have some pictures\\
2 - of her beautiful baby to show all her friends at work.\\
3 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
4 -     I don't know    \\
5 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     And you're not so big    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     Life is unfair.    \\
15 - Seriously, if you want me to stay a few more hours\\
16 - and babysit, I-I don't mind.\\
17 - Lois looks exhausted.\\
18 - No, no, no. We're fine.\\
19 - We'll see you Monday.\\
20 - Wait. Isn't today Monday?\\
21 - It's Friday.\\
22 - Oh, my God, I'm supposed to be in court today.\\
23 - I'm filing a restraining order against my sister.\\
24 - She thinks that just because\\
25 - she's been my boyfriend's first and third wife,\\
26 - that she has some kind of a claim on him.\\
27 - Isn't that...\\
28 - the cat lady?\\
29 - I guess.\\
30 - For a while she was the naked jogger.\\
31 - But mostly, she's just four bucks an hour.\\
32 - Okay, boys, in the kitchen. You're making dinner tonight.\\
33 - Why do we have to?\\
34 - Because your mother hasn't had any sleep\\
35 - for the last four days.\\
36 - Now get in there.\\
37 - And keep it down. She's nursing the baby.\\
38 - I don't want to go to sleep.\\
39 - Come on, come on.\\
40 - I'm telling you, I am not tired.\\
41 - Hal, please, just stop treating me like a child.\\
42 - Honey, you need your rest.\\
43 - The boys and I are going to take care of this baby\\
44 - for the rest of the night so you can sleep.\\
45 - So stop arguing with...\\
46 - Oh...\\
47 - Try to get Jamie to eat\\
48 - while I make a run for more diapers.\\
49 - If that nipple gets clogged,\\
50 - we've got some clean ones in the drawer.\\
51 - I'll only be gone ten minutes,\\
52 - and I don't want anything to go wrong during that time.\\
53 - I am trusting you boys are mature enough to handle this.\\
54 - He said "nipple."\\
55 - Hi, Craig.\\
56 - When will J.Lo learn?\\
57 - Take it from a bad boy, we're nothing but trouble.\\
58 - Oh. You're buying the Tidy Winks.\\
59 - Yes, and I'm in kind of a hurry.\\
60 - I don't want to criticize,\\
61 - but I think I know why you're buying the Tidy Winks.\\
62 - It's the absorbency, right?\\
63 - People always fall for that,\\
64 - but what they forget is the elasticity in the legs\\
65 - is suspect at best.\\
66 - Craig, I just... You know, since I'm kind of\\
67 - little Jamie's unofficial, second alternate godfather,\\
68 - I've been doing some research,\\
69 - and I recommend you take a look at the Baby Naps.\\
70 - They've got this polymer-based fabric\\
71 - that not only has remarkable wicking capability,\\
72 - but actually...\\
73 - Craig, for God's sakes, I'm in a hurry.\\
74 - Now, I just want the Tidy Winks, okay?\\
75 - I don't have time for a big discussion.\\
76 - Now, please, will you just ring me up?\\
77 - Certainly.\\
78 - That will be $7.98.\\
79 - Craig, don't make a thing out of this.\\
80 - Why, whatever do you mean, Hal?\\
81 - I'm sorry that I snapped at you before,\\
82 - but I really need these diapers.\\
83 - Can you loan me the money?\\
84 - I could loan you the money, Hal,\\
85 - but that would be helping you.\\
86 - And since you have a tendency to yell at people who try\\
87 - to help you, I don't think\\
88 - that's the wisest course of action\\
89 - for me to take.\\
90 - Look, Lois will pay for these\\
91 - tomorrow when she comes in.\\
92 - You can't take those!\\
93 - That's shoplifting!\\
94 - Fine. Then I'm shoplifting.\\
95 - What are you going to do about it?\\
96 - Vernon?\\
97 - Where is Dad with the diapers?\\
98 - Dewey,\\
99 - triple bag that diaper\\
100 - and make sure the garbage can lid is on tight.\\
101 - And hold your breath, because if you pass out,\\
102 - we're not coming out there to get you.\\
103 - Oven mitt.\\
104 - What a fun... Saturday night.\\
105 - Nobody's enjoying this, Stevie.\\
106 - You don't have to be sarcastic.\\
107 - I wasn't.\\
108 - Malcolm, right?\\
109 - Yeah. See, I told you, I knew his name.\\
110 - So, we have a proposal\\
111 - for you and your idiot brother.\\
112 - Oh, my God, another one.\\
113 - And he's in a wheelchair.\\
114 - Jackpot.\\
115 - Kathy?\\
116 - Do you guys want to go out on a date with us?\\
117 - You pray...\\
118 - and you pray...\\
119 - and finally...\\
120 - it happens.\\
121 - What do you mean, "Go out"?\\
122 - When? Where?\\
123 - Right now. With us.\\
124 - In that.\\
125 - Oh, my God.\\
126 - I bet it has a toilet. Dibs!\\
127 - No way, Reese. We're supposed\\
128 - to be taking care of our little brother.\\
129 - We can't just go riding around\\
130 - in the coolest car we've ever seen\\
131 - with three incredibly hot girls.\\
132 - Guys! Guys!\\
133 - I put the lid on tight,\\
134 - but I think it's eating through the...\\
135 - can.\\
136 - Okay, now, look ashamed.\\
137 - Look, can I at least\\
138 - have a phone call to let my family know where I am?\\
139 - Well, technically, you're not under arrest, so no.\\
140 - But since we're friends, I'm going to allow you\\
141 - to work off your $7.98.\\
142 - Two hours at minimum wage ought to do it.\\
143 - Stop fussing. I know you're not hungry.\\
144 - Oh, I know. You want your pacifier.\\
145 - Oh, where is it?\\
146 - What do I do?\\
147 - Oh, how about a story?\\
148 - Stories are good.\\
149 - All right, once upon a time,\\
150 - there was a little baby named Jamie\\
151 - who had a big brother named Dewey.\\
152 - Jamie worshipped Dewey.\\
153 - Dewey and Jamie always had a good time together.\\
154 - Even though their hateful, older brothers always tried\\
155 - to make their lives miserable.\\
156 - Hey, Reese, do you want to have some fun?\\
157 - Yeah. Fun is good.\\
158 - Stop it! Put him down!\\
159 - Stop it!\\
160 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
161 - We're bigger than you are.\\
162 - What do you two boys think you're doing?!\\
163 - We're sorry, Mom!\\
164 - I'm stupid!\\
165 - And the two stupid\\
166 - older brothers paid the price\\
167 - for their folly.\\
168 - I've warned you two about messing\\
169 - with my favorite children.\\
170 - Maybe this time you'll learn to behave!\\
171 - Well, now you don't have to worry\\
172 - about those two anymore.\\
173 - And, Dewey, just remember...\\
174 - ...don't go near my closet.\\
175 - Closet. Not bad.\\
176 - Okay, so here's\\
177 - the deal, freaks.\\
178 - Our boyfriends left us\\
179 - in the middle of the Fall Formal\\
180 - to go to some stupid party.\\
181 - Us!\\
182 - How could Kevin do this to me?\\
183 - I call him 12 times a day.\\
184 - I show up at all his practices.\\
185 - I even changed my whole schedule so that\\
186 - we could have all the same classes.\\
187 - Well, now we are going\\
188 - to pay them back big-time.\\
189 - Wait a minute.\\
190 - There was a Fall Formal?\\
191 - Why wouldn't we know about that?\\
192 - Oh. So, now we're going\\
193 - to go to this party\\
194 - and make out with you guys\\
195 - in front of those inconsiderate jerks.\\
196 - You want to make them jealous?\\
197 - No. We want to make them puke.\\
198 - See, once they see us kissing\\
199 - losers like you guys,\\
200 - they're never going to live it down.\\
201 - You came over to our house and asked us out\\
202 - because we were the most disgusting guys you could find?\\
203 - Actually, some kid with a hunchback and gills\\
204 - turned them down.\\
205 - Said he had too much pride.\\
206 - Forget it.\\
207 - We're not going to be paraded around\\
208 - like monkeys on a chain.\\
209 - You know, we've already been disappointed once tonight.\\
210 - Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second?!\\
211 - I don't believe this.\\
212 - I think...\\
213 - the middle one...\\
214 - likes you.\\
215 - Dewey and Jamie had to know\\
216 - what was inside the secret closet,\\
217 - but Mom kept the key hidden under her pillow.\\
218 - So they came up with a brilliant plan.\\
219 -        \\
220 - Psst!\\
221 - What are you in for?\\
222 - Diapers.\\
223 - Hmm.\\
224 - Another victim caught up in the evil net\\
225 - of Craig Feldspar!\\
226 - He's a monster.\\
227 - He treats us\\
228 - all on the night shift like dirt!\\
229 - The absolute power\\
230 - of Assistant Night Manager has corrupted him.\\
231 - We're nothing better than slaves.\\
232 - But you're the employees.\\
233 - You're the people\\
234 - who actually run this store.\\
235 - He doesn't care.\\
236 - Do you know what he insists on using\\
237 - in the coffee machine?\\
238 - Store brand.\\
239 - It is so bitter, it's like drinking death.\\
240 - He won't change the incline\\
241 - of the wheelchair ramp out front.\\
242 - I stall out every damn day until somebody gives me a push.\\
243 - He has an iron grip\\
244 - on the store radio.\\
245 - He forces us to listen only to show tunes.\\
246 - Even though we voted unanimously for Adult Contemporary.\\
247 - What does he have against Phil Collins?!\\
248 - That bastard!\\
249 - You can't let him do this to you.\\
250 - I mean, without you, he's nothing!\\
251 - He must be stopped!\\
252 - Vernon. Ooh!\\
253 - I don't know,\\
254 - maybe Craig's not so bad.\\
255 - He did give me the Employee of the Month Award\\
256 - after I cleaned his aquarium.\\
257 - Employee of the Month Awards\\
258 - are the opiate of the masses.\\
259 - You people can't let fear run your lives.\\
260 - Are you going to act or suffer under Craig forever?\\
261 - Attention, all Lucky Aide employees.\\
262 - I need someone to microwave a three-cheese Hot Pocket ASAP.\\
263 - The madness ends now.\\
264 - I told you\\
265 - they wouldn't stay at Lori's party all night.\\
266 - Well, then we'll go to Charlotte's party.\\
267 - If they're not there, then we'll go to Lisa's party,\\
268 - and then we'll try the party out on the pier.\\
269 - What parties? Who are these people?\\
270 - Do we even go to the same school?\\
271 - Stop rocking... my boat.\\
272 - Let's just walk home, take our horrible punishment from Dad\\
273 - and be done with it.\\
274 - What are you talking about?\\
275 - These girls want to fool around with us.\\
276 - Only because we're losers.\\
277 - Hey, we're riding in a limo we didn't pay for.\\
278 - We're about to make out with hot girls\\
279 - who don't even like us.\\
280 - I don't know what we are, but we are not losers.\\
281 - Have you even thought about where this is going?\\
282 - Her boyfriend is Aaron Steponovich.\\
283 - Have you seen that guy?\\
284 - If he sees you kissing his girlfriend,\\
285 - he's going to kill you.\\
286 - I know. Then why are you...?\\
287 - Because anything's better\\
288 - than the way things are now.\\
289 - Look...\\
290 - I've had this cute lab partner in science\\
291 - for eight weeks now.\\
292 - Her name is Cheryl.\\
293 - I finally left Cheryl\\
294 - a note on her desk asking her out.\\
295 - And when she read it, she turned to me and said,\\
296 - "Do you know who Reese is?"\\
297 - So then she goes, "Does anybody know who Reese is?"\\
298 - And everybody shrugged.\\
299 - So then I said, "Probably some nobody."\\
300 - And you know what?\\
301 - I was right.\\
302 - Wow. That's awful, kid.\\
303 - You want to wear my hat?\\
304 - So tonight I'm gonna fix that.\\
305 - From now on, when I walk by, people are going to say,\\
306 - "What happened to that guy's face?"\\
307 - And someone's going to say,\\
308 - "That's Reese.\\
309 - He made out with Aaron Steponovich's girlfriend."\\
310 - And that I can live with.\\
311 - Okay, so, which one do you want to kiss?\\
312 - Why don't you just ask me which kind of roach I'd rather eat?\\
313 - You are such a wuss.\\
314 - Okay, watch, I'll do it.\\
315 - Okay, I can't do this without a drink.\\
316 - You guys can get liquor?\\
317 - We know a store where this idiot works.\\
318 - Welcome to our country, Mrs. Namhong.\\
319 - I hope you're enjoying your stay here.\\
320 - You know, I'm thinking about retiring to Cambodia.\\
321 - I hear you can get a hut on the beach with a wife and servants\\
322 - for a hundred dollars a month.\\
323 - The only problem is I need these special orthotics,\\
324 - which are very difficult to find in the tropics.\\
325 - My condition's called pronation,\\
326 - which isn't so bad by itself\\
327 - but when combined with hammertoes...\\
328 - Okay, where was I?\\
329 - Oh, yeah.\\
330 - So, Dewey and Jamie waited until it was late at night...\\
331 - ...and then they made their move.\\
332 - Don't worry, Jamie.\\
333 - Not all trapdoors lead to dungeons.\\
334 - Wow.\\
335 - And that's when they realized,\\
336 - Mom and Dad had created a secret good house\\
337 - which they went to every night when the kids were asleep,\\
338 - which is why they're so obsessed with our bedtimes,\\
339 - and we never have anything nice,\\
340 - and why they always come out of the bedroom smiling!\\
341 - This 90-inch screen\\
342 - is much better\\
343 - than the 75-inch we have in the bathroom.\\
344 - Oh, absolutely.\\
345 - By the way,\\
346 - Dewey asked for ice cream again today.\\
347 - I told him we couldn't afford it.\\
348 - Oh, I wonder what he'd do\\
349 - if he saw our ice cream helicopter.\\
350 - These could use some freshening up.\\
351 - Did you charge the Brother Bot?\\
352 - I believe it's good to go.\\
353 - Drinks, Francis.\\
354 - You are the worst parents\\
355 - in the world.\\
356 - You undermine my confidence\\
357 - at every turn.\\
358 - You are the worst parents in the world.\\
359 - And yet, as unbelievable as all of this was,\\
360 - it still didn't prepare them\\
361 - for the biggest surprise of all,\\
362 - the most incredible thing they'd ever seen.\\
363 - A pair of pants, his size, that had never been worn\\
364 - or handed down from an older brother.\\
365 - With no holes, no stains,\\
366 - no funny smell, no dead stuff in the pockets.\\
367 - He had to wear those pants.\\
368 - Sorry, sorry.\\
369 - It's not so much a paste as a crust.\\
370 - I have to have it scraped off... Can we just get our...?\\
371 - Vernon!\\
372 - Hey!\\
373 - Vernon!\\
374 -     All the time, Sussudio    \\
375 -     Oh, oh    \\
376 -     Now she don't even know my name...    \\
377 - Vernon, the hamsters have left the wheel!\\
378 - This is not a drill!\\
379 - The hamsters have left the wheel!\\
380 -     Oh, oh    \\
381 -     Oh, if she called me, I'd be there    \\
382 -     I'd come running anywhere    \\
383 -     She's all I need, all my life    \\
384 -     I feel so good if I just say the word    \\
385 -     Sussudio    \\
386 -     Just say the word, oh, Sussudio    \\
387 -     Sussudio, oh, Sussudio...    \\
388 - Congratulations, guys.\\
389 - Now, when he signs that confession,\\
390 - give him his clothes back.\\
391 - What are we going to do?\\
392 - I don't know where else to get beer.\\
393 - Can we go home now?\\
394 - Shut up!\\
395 - Oh, my God!\\
396 - Joanne, Aaron's here.\\
397 - Hey, Aaron!\\
398 - You think you're so special?\\
399 - Well, watch this! I'll kiss anything!\\
400 - You don't have to do this, Reese.\\
401 - Hey, she's the one who's disgusted by this,\\
402 - not me.\\
403 - Oh, my God!\\
404 - Jamie's nunu! What?\\
405 - Jamie's nunu!\\
406 - He can't sleep without his nunu!\\
407 - We've got to get this home!\\
408 - Hey!\\
409 - I'll do anything you want. Just take us home now.\\
410 - You know, kid, for a dumb-ass, you got heart.\\
411 - Are they... meeting us... later?\\
412 - So the alarm is going off, and Dewey and Jamie are trapped.\\
413 - Oh, my God.\\
414 - Someone is trying to steal the perfect pants.\\
415 - There'll be dire consequences for this.\\
416 - Francis, find who's ever stealing the perfect pants and stop them!\\
417 - Do this, do that.\\
418 - You are terrible parents.\\
419 - You have made it impossible for me\\
420 - to trust another human being.\\
421 - You are terrible parents.\\
422 - Jamie, I should have known it was you.\\
423 - You are in so much trouble.\\
424 - You are grounded.\\
425 - Do you hear me?\\
426 - That means no TV, no phone privileges,\\
427 - no going out with your friends.\\
428 - Nothing!\\
429 - The moral of the story\\
430 - is that I'll screw you over in a heartbeat,\\
431 - the way my brothers do me.\\
432 - That's the way it works around here.\\
433 - Oh.\\
434 - You're asleep.\\
435 - Don't worry, Dewey!\\
436 - We got Jamie's nunu!\\
437 - What are you doing?\\
438 - See?\\
439 - That's all he needed.\\
440 - Everybody, relax!\\
441 - I've got the diapers!\\
442 - Dad! Dad! Dad! What?\\
443 - Way to go. Jamie was just asleep.\\
444 - You're so loud. So how am I supposed to know that?\\
445 - What is going on here?\\
446 - Oh, my God.\\
447 - Is that a newspaper diaper?\\
448 - What have you been doing?!\\
449 - You've got this baby so agitated,\\
450 - he's going to be up all night.\\
451 - You could take Jamie for a drive.\\
452 - That always puts him to sleep.\\
453 - At this hour?\\
454 - I could get used to this.\\
455 - I've never been in a limousine this big before.\\
456 - Yeah, right.
\subsection {Episode 03: Goodbye Kitty}
1 - Got my keys.\\
2 - Got my wallet. What...?\\
3 - Ah...\\
4 - Grocery list.\\
5 - You know the drill.\\
6 - Mommy never knows.\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\

14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Stevie, for the last time,\\
20 - I'm not going to partner up with you\\
21 - for wheelchair basketball.\\
22 - I smell... chicken.\\
23 - I'm not in a wheelchair.\\
24 - It's creepy.\\
25 - It's taking a spot from somebody\\
26 - who's really handicapped.\\
27 - Why don't you ask that drooling kid\\
28 - with the hot nurse?\\
29 - Norm's... a ball hog.\\
30 - Hello, boys. Mr. Kenarban,\\
31 - don't you think it's ethically suspect\\
32 - for someone to participate in wheelchair basketball\\
33 - if they're not actually handicapped?\\
34 - Even if his best friend needs to win...\\
35 - for his mother?\\
36 - Son, after being gone two months,\\
37 - your mom will be happy as a duck just to see you.\\
38 - I know she's been gone a long time, Stevie,\\
39 - but it just doesn't feel right to me.\\
40 - I've always...\\
41 - been there...\\
42 - for you.\\
43 - Please don't do this to me.\\
44 - Seventh grade...\\
45 - first dance...\\
46 - open fly.\\
47 - All right, fine. But I'm sick and tired of you\\
48 - throwing that in my face all the time.\\
49 - Save it... for the game.\\
50 - Come on, Jamie, I got to get to work.\\
51 - Eat. You'll stick a cockroach in your mouth,\\
52 - and you won't even taste this?\\
53 - Here, Dewey, you're good with the baby.\\
54 - No, I'm not. You're just saying that.\\
55 - Aw, you caught me.\\
56 - Your reward is you get to feed the baby.\\
57 - I got to run.\\
58 - What are you doing with my high school diary?\\
59 - I was looking for a baby book we can use for Jamie.\\
60 - Turns out we didn't even take the cellophane off Dewey's.\\
61 - Malcolm, Reese, get a move on!\\
62 - What on earth are you doing?\\
63 - I have to practice being in a wheelchair.\\
64 - Oh... I suppose that makes sense.\\
65 - You never know. All it takes is one\\
66 - horrible accident, and you end up\\
67 - in one of those for the rest of your life.\\
68 - It's just for basketball.\\
69 - That's the spirit.\\
70 - Reese!\\
71 - What is taking you so long?\\
72 - Why don't you\\
73 - just admit it-- nobody in this house\\
74 - cares about my hair but me!\\
75 - Let's go! Come on!\\
76 - Come on, Jamie, just eat it.\\
77 - It's not that bad.\\
78 - See?\\
79 - I don't hate it.\\
80 - Mmm!\\
81 - What did the vet say about Paint Can?\\
82 - Oh, she's fine.\\
83 - Just fine.\\
84 - It's terrible news.\\
85 - She has acute laminitis in her hoof.\\
86 - I'm afraid we will have to put her down.\\
87 - You mean kill her?\\
88 - Uh-huh.\\
89 - Oh, the poor thing.\\
90 - Who's going to have to do it?\\
91 - We will have to do it, Francis.\\
92 - You're kidding. We have no choice.\\
93 - After all,\\
94 - we are real ranchers.\\
95 - We must be strong and determined,\\
96 - and never shirk from our responsibilities,\\
97 - no matter how unpleasant they may be.\\
98 - You're going to make me do this, aren't you?\\
99 - Otto?\\
100 - Dewey, get out here or I'm going to throw your dinner away!\\
101 - Okay.\\
102 - This meal looks fantastic, Lois.\\
103 - Thank you so much for the invitation.\\
104 - Well, we figured with Kitty coming home tomorrow,\\
105 - you'd like one last chance\\
106 - to enjoy meat.\\
107 - You're not going to believe\\
108 - what happened to me at school today.\\
109 - Some girl dropped her diary\\
110 - into my backpack by mistake.\\
111 - Do you know whose it is?\\
112 - No, but it's awesome.\\
113 - She talks about her teachers, classes, friends.\\
114 - It's like a whole world I never knew existed.\\
115 - Dig in, Stevie.\\
116 - That's real butter pooling on your plate.\\
117 - Can't eat. Too excited...\\
118 - about Mom coming home.\\
119 - I made her... a card.\\
120 - Baked her a cake.\\
121 - Wrote her a song.\\
122 - Stevie, you're going to black out again.\\
123 - Can we put up Chinese lanterns?\\
124 - You bet, son.\\
125 - Anything you want.\\
126 - Hal, I wonder if I could see you for just a moment.\\
127 - Oh, sure.\\
128 - Stevie is certainly excited\\
129 - about his mother coming home tomorrow.\\
130 - Kitty isn't on a business trip.\\
131 - She divorced me two months ago.\\
132 - She's never coming home.\\
133 - What? Kitty isn't on a business trip.\\
134 - She divorced me two months ago.\\
135 - She's never coming home.\\
136 - What?\\
137 - Kitty isn't on a business trip...\\
138 - No, it's not that kind of "what."\\
139 - Stevie thinks she's coming back tomorrow.\\
140 - I know I should have told him,\\
141 - but every time I'd look in his face--\\
142 - you know me, Hal.\\
143 - I've always had a hard time being...\\
144 - you know... direct.\\
145 - That was one of my problems with Kitty.\\
146 - That, and the utterly mechanical nature of our sex life.\\
147 - Look, Stevie has to know that his mother isn't coming back.\\
148 - You're absolutely right.\\
149 - Any way you could tell him?\\
150 - Why would I tell him?\\
151 - What's the matter?\\
152 - Kitty divorced Abe. She's not coming home.\\
153 - Oh, my God! What on earth happened?\\
154 - The truth is, the last few years,\\
155 - she only stayed with me because of Stevie.\\
156 - He's always been so sick and helpless.\\
157 - The whole marriage was built\\
158 - around taking care of him.\\
159 - Oh, I had no idea.\\
160 - Then, two months ago,\\
161 - she walked in and announced\\
162 - that Stevie was finally doing just fine.\\
163 - Then she packed her bags and left.\\
164 - Now, look, Abe, I'm really sorry,\\
165 - but Stevie still has to know.\\
166 - Abe, you have got to tell Stevie.\\
167 - Tell him what?\\
168 - None of your business. Get back to the table.\\
169 - How do I tell that poor boy his mother is never coming home?\\
170 - I'll tell him.\\
171 - I told you to get out of here.\\
172 - What's going on?\\
173 - Kitty and Abe got a divorce.\\
174 - Now, leave us alone.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - Abe, you have got to do the right thing\\
177 - and go in there now.\\
178 - What about Malcolm?\\
179 - Why can't he tell him?\\
180 - Wouldn't it be more comforting\\
181 - coming from his best friend?\\
182 - I said I'd tell him.\\
183 - Reese, out. Now!\\
184 - Why should I tell him?\\
185 - Well, you're not entirely blameless in this.\\
186 - What? You're the one who always pushed him\\
187 - to try new things-- dances, ski trips, basketball.\\
188 - Before he met you,\\
189 - that boy could hardly handle a yo-yo.\\
190 - By what stretch of the imagination\\
191 - is this considered\\
192 - one full serving?\\
193 - Not now, Dewey.\\
194 - Abe, we are through talking about this. Now, go!\\
195 - Okay, I told him.\\
196 - What?\\
197 - He's taking it pretty hard.\\
198 - Somebody should probably go over there\\
199 - and talk to him.\\
200 - It's really weird.\\
201 - It's only been three days\\
202 - since Stevie found out about him mom,\\
203 - but he's regressed, like, ten years.\\
204 - So, I think we can beat these guys.\\
205 - We just can't be afraid\\
206 - to get physical under the boards.\\
207 - Come on, Stevie.\\
208 - I know you're going through a hard time,\\
209 - but we're in the tournament.\\
210 - This might help take your mind off of it for a while.\\
211 - Just talk to me, Stevie.\\
212 - I know you're not this far gone.\\
213 - You don't know anything\\
214 - about what I am going through or how I feel.\\
215 - Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to conserve\\
216 - my remaining strength for breathing.\\
217 - And stop using that.\\
218 - You can talk perfectly...\\
219 - You don't need that thing.\\
220 - Fine.\\
221 - If you're not going to talk to me,\\
222 - I'm out of here.\\
223 - This whole growing up thing's unfair.\\
224 - When you're born,\\
225 - everything's perfect,\\
226 - but before you know it, it all goes bad.\\
227 - Every day, you get a little less attention,\\
228 - you got to do more stuff.\\
229 - and they love you a little less.\\
230 - No. That's just this family.\\
231 - Reese!\\
232 - How many time do I have to tell you,\\
233 - don't leave your filthy socks on the kitchen table!\\
234 - "September 18. What an aggravating day.\\
235 - "Some idiot named Hal streaked our gym class.\\
236 - "He didn't see the volleyball net,\\
237 - "and they ended up carrying him off in a stretcher.\\
238 - "And then, at lunch, "this other guy...\\
239 - Excuse me.\\
240 - You want to pick that up?\\
241 - Why should I?\\
242 - Because it's trash.\\
243 - Or are you one of those charming people\\
244 - who thinks that's just someone else's responsibility?\\
245 - That the rest of us should follow you around your whole life\\
246 - and clean up all the little messes you leave behind?\\
247 - Let me ask you a question.\\
248 - Were you, like, born 45?\\
249 - People like you are the reason I am moving\\
250 - to Paris the second I graduate!\\
251 - Oh, my God!\\
252 - This girl rocks.\\
253 - When I tell you to pick something up, pick it up!\\
254 - I don't know what to do.\\
255 - Stevie's just devastated. Mm-hmm.\\
256 - I try to talk to him, but he just shuts me out.\\
257 - Well, he'll come around. You'll see, Abe.\\
258 - Everything will be fine. Now, come on.\\
259 - You don't want to be late for your meeting.\\
260 - I don't know what's happening with Jamie.\\
261 - We're going through all this baby food,\\
262 - and he still always wants to nurse.\\
263 - Honey, not now.\\
264 - I'm dealing with a family thing here.\\
265 - Now, if you get a little weepy\\
266 - during your presentation, do what I do:\\
267 - spill coffee on yourself and leave the room.\\
268 - You're too good to me.\\
269 - Hal, what exactly are you doing with Abe?\\
270 - I've seen you pulling the yarn balls\\
271 - off his sweater, and yesterday,\\
272 - you were massaging his feet.\\
273 - I know he means a lot to you,\\
274 - but you can't replace Kitty.\\
275 - That's ridiculous, Lois.\\
276 - I'm just being a good friend.\\
277 - You matter.\\
278 - Francis?\\
279 - Yes?\\
280 - You haven't taken care of Paint Can yet, have you?\\
281 - What kind of a question is that?\\
282 - If I had, would I be hiding from you?\\
283 - It's all right, Francis.\\
284 - It's unfair of me to put this burden on you.\\
285 - We will do this thing together.\\
286 - Just think. We will be sending her\\
287 - to a much better place,\\
288 - with open fields and cool mountain springs\\
289 - where she can run all day,\\
290 - and horses ride people.\\
291 - Unless, of course, she's been a bad horse.\\
292 - Then she will have to spend eternity in a lake of fire,\\
293 - with a delicious bale of hay just out of reach.\\
294 - Otto, I've never killed anything bigger than a poodle.\\
295 - And that was a total accident.\\
296 - Francis, as hard as it will be, I know we can do this.\\
297 - No one said the cowboy life was easy.\\
298 - I'll meet you here at 5:00, after yoga.\\
299 - Stevie, what are you doing?\\
300 - I've seen you do wheelies up and down this ramp.\\
301 - Why don't you find yourself another project?\\
302 - Lloyd looks happy.\\
303 - Why don't you destroy his family?\\
304 - Stevie, I know what your mom did was horrible,\\
305 - but you've got to stop feeling sorry for yourself.\\
306 - Get mad.\\
307 - That's what I would do if my mom walked out on me.\\
308 - Okay, not  my  mom.\\
309 - But the point is, you have every right to be angry.\\
310 - You're right.\\
311 - That's exactly what I needed to hear.\\
312 - Thanks very much.\\
313 - There you go.\\
314 - This thing sucks at sarcasm.\\
315 - Fine.\\
316 - "My mommy left me, and now I'm a helpless baby."\\
317 - Well, I'm not going to let you just sit there\\
318 - and feel sorry for yourself.\\
319 - Think fast.\\
320 - Come on, you're not that big of a wuss.\\
321 - You are not in charge of how big a wuss I am.\\
322 - I know you can use your arms. Catch it!\\
323 - Look at the helpless little boy in the wheelchair.\\
324 - Look at the little cripple.\\
325 - Are you going to cry?\\
326 - Are you going to cry, little cripple boy?\\
327 - Ooh, it's a baby in a wheelchair.\\
328 - I might be going down a bad road here,\\
329 - but if I stop before I make my point,\\
330 - this could look kind of bad.\\
331 - "I'm a little baby.\\
332 - "I can't move my legs. Kick his ass.\\
333 - Where's my mommy?"\\
334 - Well, this is interesting.\\
335 - I now officially qualify for wheelchair basketball.\\
336 - Never help anyone.\\
337 - You've never been in love, have you?\\
338 - October 12.\\
339 - At lunch, J.J. was telling my fortune.\\
340 - Wow, "girl" again.\\
341 - I keep telling you, I'm only going to have girls.\\
342 - That's if I have kids at all.\\
343 - I mean, the whole suburban mom thing\\
344 - seems like such a nightmare.\\
345 - Who is that?\\
346 - I don't know.\\
347 - But he's getting to second base,\\
348 - if I have anything to say about it.\\
349 - Whoa.\\
350 - I just have to figure out a way to get him to notice me.\\
351 - I don't think you have to worry about that.\\
352 - What do you mean?\\
353 - Well, you know,\\
354 - he'll probably do something you don't like,\\
355 - and you'll unload on him.\\
356 - What?!\\
357 - I don't unload on people.\\
358 - Honey, I hate to be the one to tell you this,\\
359 - but the truth is, everyone calls you "The Mouth."\\
360 - The Mouth?\\
361 - Yeah, but they're just a bunch of immature jerks.\\
362 - And the principal, he's just trying to fit in.\\
363 - Abe, you're not getting the flu.\\
364 - It's just your allergies.\\
365 - Did you take your spray?\\
366 - Look in your vest pocket.\\
367 - Uh-huh.\\
368 - What am I going to do with you?\\
369 - Can you pat my back?\\
370 - Thanks.\\
371 - Here you go, Paint Can.\\
372 - Got you the biggest, nicest carrot I could find.\\
373 - Please, Francis, let us not drag this out\\
374 - any longer than we have to.\\
375 - Okay, let's just do it.\\
376 - Don't worry, Paint Can.\\
377 - It will all be over soon.\\
378 - One quick pull of the trigger,\\
379 - and we will put an end\\
380 - to her misery.\\
381 - Ready...\\
382 - aim...\\
383 - fire!\\
384 - Why didn't you shoot?\\
385 - Well, you didn't shoot, either.\\
386 - I wasn't ready.\\
387 - I'm ready now.\\
388 - Good. Here we go. Ready...\\
389 - aim...\\
390 - fire!\\
391 - Oh, come on, Francis, you're being a coward.\\
392 - Me? You totally chickened out.\\
393 - All right.\\
394 - One the count of three,\\
395 - we both shoot, no matter what.\\
396 - One...\\
397 - two...\\
398 - Bang!\\
399 - Oh... Come on.\\
400 - If you're not...\\
401 - You could have killed me. Only after you killed me.\\
402 - You cannot kill a horse, What's wrong with you?\\
403 - but you have no problem killing Otto.\\
404 - Paint Can?\\
405 - What's the matter with her?\\
406 - I think she choked on the carrot.\\
407 - Well, I guess no one can say\\
408 - we're not real ranchers now.\\
409 - Yeah.\\
410 - I just hope we don't develop\\
411 - too much of a taste for killing.\\
412 - I've been thinking about\\
413 - picking up Stevie some of those baggy pants\\
414 - he's been wanting.\\
415 - Hal, we've been through this.\\
416 - All the kids are wearing them.\\
417 - It's not like he's joining a gang.\\
418 - Well, maybe you're right.\\
419 - You do know best about these things.\\
420 - He's lucky to have you, Hal.\\
421 - Can I get you anything from the kitchen?\\
422 - No, I'm fine.\\
423 - Thanks, honey.\\
424 - Abe?\\
425 - Huh?\\
426 - You just tried to kiss me.\\
427 - No.\\
428 - No, that was a lip twitch.\\
429 - See? There it goes again.\\
430 - You know what?\\
431 - I'm glad this happened.\\
432 - Because it made me realize something.\\
433 - Get out.\\
434 - What?\\
435 - I can't replace Kitty.\\
436 - And I'm not doing you any favors by trying.\\
437 - But what am I supposed to do without you?\\
438 - What am I supposed to do about Stevie?\\
439 - I don't have the slightest idea.\\
440 - But you're his father.\\
441 - So just get in there.\\
442 - I know you'll be able to figure it out.\\
443 - You can do this.\\
444 - Now, go.\\
445 - All right.\\
446 - Hold on.\\
447 - Okay.\\
448 - Mom,\\
449 - I have a proposal for you.\\
450 - Now, before you start poking holes in it,\\
451 - I'd like you to hear me out.\\
452 - All I want is no more school\\
453 - and no more big boy clothes.\\
454 - I'd liked to be bathed and rocked before I go to sleep\\
455 - and have all my food mashed up.\\
456 - In return, I'll be adorable and...\\
457 - Are you wearing a diaper?\\
458 - I want you to know my level of commitment.\\
459 - Oh, my God!\\
460 - Stevie!\\
461 - Stevie, where are you, son? I want to...\\
462 - Come on.\\
463 - For God's sake, son,\\
464 - what are you doing out here?\\
465 - You're soaking wet.\\
466 - At last you tell me the truth about something.\\
467 - Son, I know you've had a terrible shock,\\
468 - and you need your father to get you through this.\\
469 - Well, that's not going to happen\\
470 - because your daddy is a weak, weak man.\\
471 - Son, what your mother did to you was horrible.\\
472 - And what I did to you wasn't any better.\\
473 - I'm sorry.\\
474 - Keep going.\\
475 - Stevie, I know your whole life\\
476 - you've had to face tremendous adversity.\\
477 - You've shown more courage\\
478 - than I've had any right to expect.\\
479 - And now you're going to have to show even more.\\
480 - I know it's not fair,\\
481 - but believe me, you can do this.\\
482 - I've learned to be amazed when it comes to you.\\
483 - And if it helps, I promise I'll always be there.\\
484 - Frightened and full of denial, but there.\\
485 - Let's go... home.\\
486 - I'll catch... I didn't mean to!\\
487 - You better... It was a joke!\\
488 - You're making it worse! I'm a big boy!\\
489 - Okay, you drive to the hoop.\\
490 - When they double-team you, kick it out to me,\\
491 - and I'll take the shot.\\
492 - I'll... take the shot.\\
493 - I don't... have a mom.\\
494 - Okay, that's the third time today\\
495 - you've played the "mom card."\\
496 - Get... used to it.\\
497 - Hey, jackass,\\
498 - think it's a big joke to be in a wheelchair?\\
499 - No, no, no, this is real, you know.\\
500 - I was in a... oh!\\
501 - Ow! Oh!\\
502 - October 17.\\
503 - I kept my mouth shut around Jason for a whole week,\\
504 - and he asked me out.\\
505 - I will never go back to the old me. No!\\
506 - Something wrong?\\
507 - Do you think it's right\\
508 - to totally change who you are\\
509 - and turn your back on everything you believe in\\
510 - just to impress a hot guy?\\
511 - Burt Reynolds hot or Sting hot?\\
512 - Forget it.\\
513 - So then we put in dual exhaust,\\
514 - and now the thing just flies.\\
515 - I got it up to 130 miles an hour last night.\\
516 - Mm-hmm.\\
517 - I like talking to you.\\
518 - You're a good listener.\\
519 - So we're all going to ditch class on Friday.\\
520 - Dave's dad is out of town.\\
521 - We're going to borrow his speedboat.\\
522 - So do you want to?\\
523 - Okay, that's got to stop. Huh?\\
524 - I'm trying to be nice and not criticize,\\
525 - but I just have to say that\\
526 - that is the most filthy, disgusting habit I've ever seen.\\
527 - Yes! That's my girl.\\
528 - Someone's gonna lean against that\\
529 - and get it stuck to their clothes, but do you care?\\
530 - No, because you're nothing but a self-absorbed,\\
531 - inconsiderate slob.\\
532 - I'm sorry.\\
533 - Wow.\\
534 - I love how you're so passionate about ecology and stuff.\\
535 - Really?\\
536 - Yeah.\\
537 - It's cool.\\
538 - I could hardly breathe.\\
539 - I knew he was going to kiss me.\\
540 - You are so hot.\\
541 - So are you.\\
542 - Reese!\\
543 - I thought I told you to take out the...\\
544 - What are you doing with my old diary?
\subsection {Episode 04: Thanksgiving}
1 - You're only going to take off a quarter-inch on the sides,\\
2 - leave the top and just clean up the back.\\
3 - Reese, I've done this a million times.\\
4 - Mom, look. I just ripped\\
5 - my brand-new shirt\\
6 - sneaking into the reservoir--\\
7 - that place you clearly ordered me never to go.\\
8 - I don't know why I do these things\\
9 - that are so infuriating to you,\\
10 - but the funny thing is, I don't even care.\\
11 - Damn it, Dewey, go to your room!\\
12 - Let's get this over with!\\
13 - No, Mom! Count to ten! Count to ten!\\
14 -     Life is unfair.    \\
15 - Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.\\
16 - I'll tell you what I'm thankful for.\\
17 - I finally made friends with some normal kids at school.\\
18 - Normal kids.\\
19 - We've been hanging out here all afternoon,\\
20 - and nobody's mentioned grass allergies\\
21 - or pollen count.\\
22 - Malcolm, I never noticed what nice eyes you have.\\
23 - Really? Kirsten Stuart.\\
24 - I think she likes me, but I can never be sure.\\
25 - Yeah, I guess I was distracted\\
26 - by your freakishly large head.\\
27 - Mostly 'cause of stuff like that.\\
28 - Hey, guys, I've got to go.\\
29 - Hey, party at my house, Thanksgiving.\\
30 - Three cases of beer. No one's leaving till their gone.\\
31 - Your parents are out of town?\\
32 - No.\\
33 - Oh, sweet. Yeah, of course.\\
34 - Cute butt.\\
35 - Why'd you have to spoil it?\\
36 - I know what she's trying to do.\\
37 - She's trying to confuse me, throw me off balance.\\
38 - But you know what? It's not going...\\
39 - Reese!\\
40 - Grab an apron.\\
41 - It's 6:30 in the morning.\\
42 - Yes, I know.\\
43 - That means I have exactly 12 hours left\\
44 - to create the most fantastic Thanksgiving feast\\
45 - in the history of Thanksgiving feasts.\\
46 - What's with the sheets?\\
47 - I can't cook with distractions.\\
48 - I don't think that's...\\
49 - Dad, remember the chocolate souffl  \\
50 - I made for Thanksgiving two years ago?\\
51 - Oh, yeah. That was...\\
52 - Rat puke compared to what I have planned!\\
53 - The crepes I made last Thanksgiving?\\
54 - Ooh, they were...\\
55 - Crap next to what we're having tonight!\\
56 - Don't think of this as a meal.\\
57 - This is going to be like eating the Mona Lisa.\\
58 - Reese, I hardly think you can comp...\\
59 - Oh, my God.\\
60 - What do you need?\\
61 - Your mindless, robot-like obedience\\
62 - to every demand I make-- no matter how small.\\
63 - Plus, we get to eat anything that falls on the floor.\\
64 - Ooh!\\
65 - I'm going over to Dylan's. I'll be back by dinner.\\
66 - Dylan-- whom I've never met because you're afraid\\
67 - to have me find out what a bad choice he is as a friend?\\
68 - He's okay, Mom. There's going to be other kids from school there.\\
69 - It's sort of like a party. I really want to go.\\
70 - Well, your family is having sort of like a party, too.\\
71 - It's called Thanksgiving. Now, it's true we're\\
72 - not a bunch of friends you just met last week.\\
73 - We're only the people who have sacrificed our lives\\
74 - for years so that you could have a home.\\
75 - I'll only be gone a couple hours, okay?\\
76 - You mean like the couple of hours you were jammed\\
77 - half-in and half-out of me when you were being born?\\
78 - Half an hour? I just don't understand\\
79 - what is so horrible about our family.\\
80 - Yes, she does.\\
81 - I mean, why on earth would you prefer\\
82 - to be somewhere else\\
83 - for Thanksgiving?\\
84 - I love her!\\
85 - And if the two of you are too dead inside\\
86 - to understand what that means, then I just pity you.\\
87 - No, no, Dad, I understand.\\
88 - When you get a new toothbrush and you want to break it in...\\
89 - Go ahead and say it, Lois.\\
90 - Well, happy Thanksgiving.\\
91 - I'll just go over there and tell them I'm not coming.\\
92 - Do whatever you want.\\
93 - Even though your brother has\\
94 - traveled hundreds of miles with her.\\
95 - Piama. I know her name.\\
96 - Your family is going to be here,\\
97 - and we are going to have a lovely Thanksgiving.\\
98 - I will not keep my voice down!\\
99 - What, you think they won't know in, like, five minutes\\
100 - that we're getting a divorce?!\\
101 - Sorry, we're having some problems.\\
102 - Having some problems?\\
103 - Is that what you call finding out\\
104 - that all the love that we shared was a lie?!\\
105 - Hi, Mom.\\
106 - Malcolm, you better go get your father.\\
107 - Malcolm!\\
108 - This party's pretty cool.\\
109 - And, you know,\\
110 - I think I've figured Kirsten out.\\
111 - It's more of a friend-brother kind of thing.\\
112 - It's not really sexual.\\
113 - Then again...\\
114 - Beer man.\\
115 - My stepdad drinks so much, he never counts it.\\
116 - Malcolm?\\
117 - Yeah, sure.\\
118 - Yeah, sure.\\
119 - Hey, guys, how's it going?\\
120 - I need something to warm up that Arctic wind\\
121 - she's blowing up there.\\
122 - No offense to your mother.\\
123 - I love her very much.\\
124 - It's cool, Art.\\
125 - All right. You kids have fun.\\
126 - Somebody drop a beer?\\
127 - Sorry.\\
128 - My parents are a little less casual\\
129 - about the whole beer thing.\\
130 - I bet you kiss like a nine-year-old.\\
131 - What?\\
132 - What?\\
133 - Okay, this one I do know what she was doing.\\
134 - It was a total come-on.\\
135 - I'll show her how a nine-year-old can kiss.\\
136 - Hey.\\
137 - Don't tell me not to cry!\\
138 - Maybe my tears will make an ocean\\
139 - and you can sail off on a boat\\
140 - to a new life without me!\\
141 - How did this happen? It's terrible.\\
142 - What's that look, Hal?\\
143 - Come on, Lois. You've been trying\\
144 - to undercut this relationship from the start.\\
145 - And now all of a sudden, they're getting a divorce\\
146 - and you had nothing to do with it?\\
147 - Please. You really think I have that much power\\
148 - to orchestrate people's lives besides yours?\\
149 - All I know is that our son is talking\\
150 - about ending his marriage--\\
151 - a marriage which you never supported.\\
152 - Hal, that's ridiculous. Fine, fine.\\
153 - You want me to go talk to Francis?\\
154 - Yes. No!\\
155 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
156 - This is some way for you to try to work out your agenda.\\
157 - Fine. I will not say a word to either one of 'em.\\
158 - Good.\\
159 - Wait. You won't say anything,\\
160 - which means you're just going to let\\
161 - this whole thing fall apart.\\
162 - Oh, I see your game, Lois.\\
163 - Hal, what is it you want me to do?\\
164 - No, no, you are not dragging me\\
165 - into your little Machiavellian schemes, thank you very much.\\
166 - No, you spun these tangled webs yourself, Lois.\\
167 - You get yourself out.\\
168 - See?\\
169 - The real balsamic has a smoother mouth feel.\\
170 - Good, you're back.\\
171 - I'm going to start prepping the herbs de Provence\\
172 - and saut  ing the mushrooms.\\
173 - I need you to scrub these pots and pans again.\\
174 - What?\\
175 - No, I just finished those.\\
176 - Dad, look at this.\\
177 - The stubborn patina of tuna casserole,\\
178 - or enchilada loaf,\\
179 - or whatever in God's name\\
180 - this greasy spoon churns out night after soul-killing night.\\
181 - But not tonight.\\
182 - Tonight we go for greatness.\\
183 - Are you with me, Dad?\\
184 - No!\\
185 - This pot is clean enough, Reese.\\
186 - No one will taste this.\\
187 - All right, then.\\
188 - I guess no one will ever taste this!\\
189 - Oh, my God.\\
190 - Dewey, I need you to do something for me.\\
191 - No. No more.\\
192 - I'm sick of this.\\
193 - If I have to sculpt another radish\\
194 - or de-vein another prawn...\\
195 - Dewey, do you trust me?\\
196 - No. Do you fear me?\\
197 - No. Not in the long run.\\
198 - Come on, Dewey.\\
199 - It's just a couple of things I need\\
200 - that I couldn't get Dad to spring for.\\
201 - So here's $80 from Dad's wallet.\\
202 - The items on this list cost $240,\\
203 - so you'll have to turn on the cute.\\
204 - Can you handle it?\\
205 - I keep whatever's left over?\\
206 - Deal.\\
207 - Mom, can I talk to you?\\
208 - No, honey, please.\\
209 - Don't talk to me about this.\\
210 - No matter what I say, I'm going to be blamed.\\
211 - This is for you to work out with that woman.\\
212 - Piama. I know her name.\\
213 - Could you just listen to me for a second?\\
214 - If Piama and I ever were to get a divorce...\\
215 - Francis, don't even talk like that.\\
216 - I mean it.\\
217 - You really shouldn't.\\
218 - What were you going to say?\\
219 - If we ever were to split up, could I stay here for a while?\\
220 - God, Francis, I hate to even think of such a thing.\\
221 - But, yes, if such a terrible thing were to happen,\\
222 - of course, we'd be here for you.\\
223 - Thanks, Mom. I mean, it was\\
224 - a stupid fight, I guess, but it was emblematic\\
225 - of everything that was bad with the relationship.\\
226 - I mean, there are principles. Principles are important.\\
227 - I know. I mean, so what if I'd had a couple beers?\\
228 - How does it look in front of the guys if the woman's driving?\\
229 - What?\\
230 - She didn't care about my feelings at all.\\
231 - What?!\\
232 - What?\\
233 - Of all the idiotic, asinine things\\
234 - you have ever said, Francis,\\
235 - this has got to be one of the worst!\\
236 - I thought you were on my side.\\
237 - You don't have a side!\\
238 - Now, you are going to go and apologize to that woman.\\
239 - You are going to tell her that you are wrong\\
240 - and she is absolutely blameless.\\
241 - You really...? Go!\\
242 - Okay, okay.\\
243 - Yes, he is an idiot.\\
244 - Okay, Dad, get the bird.\\
245 - Here.\\
246 - What, this is the turkey you got?\\
247 - It's perfect. It's really small.\\
248 - Well, if it were any bigger,\\
249 - it wouldn't be able to fit inside of this!\\
250 - What? Y-You're going to put our dinner\\
251 - inside that monster?\\
252 - It's a monkfish.\\
253 - The juices of the monkfish will baste the turkey.\\
254 - The flavor from the turkey will saturate the fish,\\
255 - both melding into one fantastic dish.\\
256 - Reese, this doesn't seem like a good idea.\\
257 - I don't know, Dad. Maybe you're right.\\
258 - Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about.\\
259 - Oh! Mmm!\\
260 - You know, that really shouldn't work.\\
261 - Listen, my ugly beauty.\\
262 - Yesterday you were sucking scum\\
263 - off the bottom of the sea.\\
264 - Tonight you're going to tango with the gods.\\
265 - Yes, master, I will be delicious for you.\\
266 - Okay, things have definitely been going better.\\
267 - I'm absolutely more or less sure she might like me...\\
268 - I think.\\
269 - Looks like you're behind the proverbial eight ball.\\
270 - Oh, geez, "proverbial?"\\
271 - Maybe she didn't notice.\\
272 - Malcolm, can you hand me the chalk?\\
273 - It's right there next to the proverbial cheese dip.\\
274 - Okay, okay.\\
275 - I know it was a little stilted.\\
276 - No, I thought it was right on the proverbial money.\\
277 - All right. Sorry. Did I hit the proverbial sore spot?\\
278 - You know, you may think that's flirting, but it's not.\\
279 - It's just hostility.\\
280 - No, I-I'm pretty sure it's flirting.\\
281 - Really?\\
282 - I guess I'm not as good at this as I thought.\\
283 - Before we're old?\\
284 - Son, these truffles are really expensive.\\
285 - And if you lost your money, it's really not my problem.\\
286 - But...\\
287 - ...they told me to get truffles.\\
288 - I don't know why, but...\\
289 - ...my parents tell me this is going to be\\
290 - a very special Thanksgiving.\\
291 - My boss is a jackass anyway.\\
292 - Thank... ...you.\\
293 - I saw you talking to Francis, Lois.\\
294 - You couldn't stay out of it, could you?\\
295 - You had to drive a wedge.\\
296 - Hal, I told him that Piama was right\\
297 - and that he has to apologize to her.\\
298 - Okay.\\
299 - I'm not smart enough to figure out what you're up to,\\
300 - but when something bad happens, I am blaming you.\\
301 - Dad, what are these?\\
302 - Minced onions.\\
303 - Minced? I specifically\\
304 - asked for diced!\\
305 - Come on, Dad!\\
306 - Don't take that tone with me, Reese.\\
307 - This isn't fun.\\
308 - Fun? No, Dewey, this is not fun.\\
309 - Neither one of you seems to understand.\\
310 - We are not playing games here.\\
311 - There are lives at stake.\\
312 - No, there aren't.\\
313 - Okay, but it's very important.\\
314 - We're creating something special, something great...\\
315 - ...something beautiful.\\
316 - Why is my wallet in my other pocket?\\
317 - Can we stay focused, Dad?\\
318 - There was $80 in here.\\
319 - I had to!\\
320 - The cheese course was a joke.\\
321 - Reese, you are in big trouble.\\
322 - And you know what? I have had it with this.\\
323 - I'm through!\\
324 - With the helping part.\\
325 - I'm still doing the eating part.\\
326 - Fine, go.\\
327 - I don't need you. I still have Dewey.\\
328 - He's twice the assistant entremetier that you'll ever be!\\
329 - Why haven't you talked to her yet?\\
330 - She won't let me. Every time I go near her,\\
331 - she walks out of the room.\\
332 - Piama... I know\\
333 - that you and I have had our differences...\\
334 - Oh, you mean the cold, uncomfortable silences\\
335 - broken by the occasional veiled insult?\\
336 - I'm not sure I would have put it like that.\\
337 - Look.\\
338 - Here's what I want to say.\\
339 - I believe in marriage.\\
340 - I believe in every marriage.\\
341 - And I think if you just listen to Francis,\\
342 - you'll like what you hear.\\
343 - Fine.\\
344 - Francis.\\
345 - I'll just leave you two to talk.\\
346 - You know what?\\
347 - I didn't want to butt in, but I'm glad I did.\\
348 - What did you do, Lois? I talked to Piama.\\
349 - At least she seemed interested in listening\\
350 - to what Francis had to say.\\
351 - He's going to tell her exactly what I told him to say.\\
352 - What business is it of yours\\
353 - if I don't want to wear thong underpants?\\
354 - What?\\
355 - Piama, I didn't get to finish.\\
356 - See what happens, Lois?\\
357 - I don't care what shape we cut the mushrooms! I quit!\\
358 - This is why you're always going to be a little man\\
359 - living in a little world!\\
360 - I don't need you! I don't need anyone!\\
361 - This is the worst Thanksgiving ever!\\
362 - This is the best Thanksgiving ever.\\
363 - I'm going to memorize this moment so I never forget it.\\
364 - This is the best Thanksgiving ever.\\
365 - I'm going to memorize this moment so I never forget it.\\
366 - Where is everybody?\\
367 - Fireworks?\\
368 - Bastards.\\
369 - No one came and got us.\\
370 - Well, the hell with them.\\
371 - Let me do the talking.\\
372 - Good evening to you, sir.\\
373 - Oh, hi.\\
374 - Where is everyone?\\
375 - Studying. Probably.\\
376 - That would be my guess.\\
377 - What, is he asleep?\\
378 - I think he ate too much turkey.\\
379 - All that kryptonite...\\
380 - There's pie upstairs.\\
381 - Thank you.\\
382 - That's a very generous offer.\\
383 - I know the pilgrims,\\
384 - you know, facing that first bitter cold winter,\\
385 - Malcolm, he's gone. really would have\\
386 - appreciated a little bit of pie. That might... Ow!\\
387 - I think I'm getting better at reading her signals.\\
388 - Are you okay?\\
389 -     I'm back.    \\
390 - Come on... let's do it.\\
391 - You gonna?\\
392 - I got to go.\\
393 - My brother will kick your ass if you tell.\\
394 - What is all this stuff?\\
395 - Piama, good, I need you.\\
396 - Here, stir this pot.\\
397 - All right, all right.\\
398 - I just have to stuff the acorn squash rings\\
399 - with roasted pepper and polenta,\\
400 - sear the scallops with...\\
401 - The monkfish!\\
402 - Where are the oven mitts?!\\
403 - You want me to look?\\
404 - No, keep stirring.\\
405 - No place mats, no tea towels... I need something.\\
406 - I'll get a towel from the bathroom.\\
407 - No, there's not enough time!\\
408 - It has to come out at exactly 5:38.\\
409 - Not 5:37, not 5:39.\\
410 - What are you going to do?\\
411 - There's only one thing I can do.\\
412 - Reese, no!\\
413 - Yes!\\
414 - Clear me a space!\\
415 - Where?!\\
416 - Move the oven mitts!\\
417 - Where is Malcolm?\\
418 - He knows he's supposed to be here.\\
419 - This is Thanksgiving.\\
420 - Yeah...\\
421 - he certainly wouldn't want to miss this.\\
422 - Well, I've done it.\\
423 - The feast is about to start.\\
424 - It's about time.\\
425 - I'm not even hungry.\\
426 - Can I be excused?\\
427 - Oh, my...\\
428 - Wow.\\
429 - Mmm...\\
430 - Wow. Oh!\\
431 - The turkey monkfish.\\
432 - I'll say grace.\\
433 - Thank you, Lord, for giving me the talent\\
434 - to express my love for my family in the only way I know how.\\
435 - Amen. Amen.\\
436 - Hey, party people.\\
437 - Oh, my God, you're drunk!\\
438 - What on earth is wrong with you?\\
439 - I will tell you what is wrong with me, on earth.\\
440 - The reason why I drank is because I'm a coward,\\
441 - and probably gay.\\
442 - I let a perfect opportunity\\
443 - just slip right through my fingers, and, you know,\\
444 - I thought I'd cap it off\\
445 - by getting stinking drunk.\\
446 - What do you think of your golden boy now, Mom?\\
447 - What "golden boy"?!\\
448 - Get in your room!\\
449 - I'll deal with you later.\\
450 - I will go to my room\\
451 - when I am finished\\
452 - with what I have to say.\\
453 - Hey, come on.\\
454 - Some of the shrimp is still good.\\
455 - I just left her there on the floor and staggered home.\\
456 - To shower us with affection.\\
457 - Yeah.\\
458 - Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\\
459 - I mean, sure, the distance wasn't much of a factor,\\
460 - but the volume was impressive.\\
461 - So you going to see this girl again?\\
462 - Are you kidding?\\
463 - I can't believe it.\\
464 - We were alone. She wanted to do it.\\
465 - I was right there.\\
466 - How could I have chickened out?\\
467 - Dude, you didn't take advantage of a drunk chick.\\
468 - Mom must be slipping.\\
469 - All I got was no TV, video games or computer.\\
470 - I have to clean all\\
471 - the kitchen and bathroom tile with a toothbrush,\\
472 - wash every window in the house\\
473 - and change Jamie's diaper for the next six months, but...\\
474 - No, you got, like, nine other things\\
475 - after you passed out.\\
476 - You have got to do something, Lois.\\
477 - Piama just asked me for a ride to the bus station.\\
478 - I thought you didn't want me to interfere.\\
479 - Okay, I take back everything I said.\\
480 - You can interfere as much as you want-- just fix it!\\
481 - Well...\\
482 - I'm ready.\\
483 - Piama, there's just one thing I want to say.\\
484 - I know that breaking up is painful,\\
485 - but I think in the long run, you'll find it's for the best.\\
486 - For the best? Well, Francis, let's be serious.\\
487 - This marriage never had a chance.\\
488 - I just think that you'll be\\
489 - better friends once you're divorced.\\
490 - Who said we're getting divorced?\\
491 - I love Francis!\\
492 - You can't stand to see anyone happy,\\
493 - can you, Mom?\\
494 - Come on, honey,\\
495 - let's go get my things.\\
496 - They're out in the trash.\\
497 - Sorry, honey.\\
498 - That's okay, sweetie.\\
499 - Once again, you've underestimated us.\\
500 - We're not the little\\
501 - dancing monkeys you thought we were.\\
502 - Thanks, honey.
\subsection {Episode 05: Malcolm Films Reese}
1 - Come on, we can't. We'll wake up the baby.\\
2 - That is what old reliable is for.\\
3 - Besides, babies at this age don't remember anything.\\
4 -     Life is unfair.    \\
5 - What is wrong with you?\\
6 - You two ruin everything.\\
7 - Look what you've done to this shirt.\\
8 - You saw the price tag, and you knew\\
9 - I'd just bought it.\\
10 - This has become a daily event.\\
11 - She actually pays more attention to them than to us.\\
12 - Maybe that's not a bad thing.\\
13 - Do you think I can afford to keep on buying new clothes?\\
14 - Oh, honey, come on. Hey. Enough is enough.\\
15 - Look, I want you to go out and buy a new washer and dryer.\\
16 - You know we can't afford that.\\
17 - Look, I wasn't going to say anything yet,\\
18 - but you know all those crappy stock options\\
19 - I've been getting instead of bonuses?\\
20 - Well, I think they're finally going to be worth something.\\
21 - There have been people flying back and forth to New York\\
22 - and all these closed-door meetings.\\
23 - I think that merger is finally going through.\\
24 - Oh, Hal, that would be wonderful.\\
25 - Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.\\
26 - Don't want to be late for school today.\\
27 - I'm handing in my diorama.\\
28 - No, no, no!\\
29 - 16 weeks of Intermediate Psychology,\\
30 - and you can't classify a simple test case?\\
31 - I thought at least your ears were functional, Kenarban.\\
32 - I know castration complex when I see it.\\
33 - I'm trying to get you to go beyond convenient labels.\\
34 - To quote Blake,\\
35 - "To generalize is to be a fool."\\
36 - Idiot. Excuse me?\\
37 - Blake wrote, "To generalize is to be an idiot."\\
38 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
39 - Tomorrow, people, I want\\
40 - progress reports on your term projects.\\
41 - I have to talk to Herkabe for a second. Will you wait up?\\
42 - Got gym.\\
43 - Have to change...\\
44 - my tires.\\
45 - Mr. Herkabe, you still haven't given me my term project.\\
46 - I've been asking you every day for a month.\\
47 - Malcolm, you make it sound like I'm trying\\
48 - to sabotage your impeccable grade-point average.\\
49 - Please just give me something\\
50 - so I can get started. All right, tell you what.\\
51 - Why don't you come by my office at lunch\\
52 - and I'll give you your assignment.\\
53 - Your office?\\
54 - Why is everybody so afraid of my office?\\
55 - A reminder, class officer ballots\\
56 - can be picked up at the registrar's office.\\
57 - JV basketball practice\\
58 - will again be held in the auxiliary gym.\\
59 - Oh, and Patty Lin committed a Code Nine in the library\\
60 - and is hereby suspended.\\
61 - I trust the stick of gum was worth it.\\
62 - Ah, Malcolm. You have waited\\
63 - very patiently for your term project,\\
64 - and today your patience pays off.\\
65 - Here.\\
66 - What's this?\\
67 - You are holding a video surveillance camera.\\
68 - The lens is in the logo, and the video is transmitted\\
69 - via wireless signal to this digital tape recorder.\\
70 - What am I supposed to do with it?\\
71 - You are going to secretly conduct\\
72 - an in-depth case study of a deviant mind,\\
73 - the most deviant mind that we have at our disposal.\\
74 - A mind incapable of differentiating\\
75 - between right and wrong, a diseased...\\
76 - You're talking about my brother. Yes.\\
77 - And you want me to secretly videotape him?\\
78 - Around you, he'll relax, let his guard down,\\
79 - begin to talk about himself.\\
80 - These disciplinary files reveal nothing of the real Reese.\\
81 - What you're asking me to do\\
82 - is creepy on about a hundred different levels.\\
83 - You have one week.\\
84 - The newspaper is here.\\
85 - The newspaper is here.\\
86 - The newspaper is here.\\
87 - You know those come out every day, right?\\
88 - No, no, today is the day\\
89 - our review appears in the Lifestyle section.\\
90 - Charles Cutler himself came out.\\
91 - He only does the biggies.\\
92 - Francis, you read it-- I'm too nervous.\\
93 - "A visit to the Grotto raises many questions,\\
94 - "foremost among them,\\
95 - "how could a kind and loving God\\
96 - grant these monsters a hotel license?"\\
97 - "From the swinish cretins\\
98 - "posing as staff members up to and including\\
99 - "cuisine that would embarrass an orphanage,\\
100 - "the Grotto is quite simply\\
101 - the worst hotel in the history of the world."\\
102 - I'm sorry. I was so nervous, I wasn't even listening.\\
103 - Start again.\\
104 - Hey, have you seen Dewey anywhere?\\
105 - I want to try something out on him.\\
106 - No. So, uh, how are you?\\
107 - Huh?\\
108 - I'm just curious how you're feeling.\\
109 - How the hell should I know?\\
110 - Well, are you happy?\\
111 - Are you sad?\\
112 - Like, when you laugh,\\
113 - you're feeling that something's funny.\\
114 - Like when I tripped Arthur Hall\\
115 - and his retainer went flying out of his mouth\\
116 - into a pile of dog crap? That was awesome.\\
117 - So you think it's funny when other people get hurt?\\
118 - I think it's funny when you shut up.\\
119 - Okay. Okay.\\
120 - Hey, they laugh at me.\\
121 - People laugh at you?\\
122 - Yeah, people laugh at me.\\
123 - But not for long.\\
124 - So, what you're saying is,\\
125 - when people laugh at you, it hurts,\\
126 - and then you want to make them hurt, too?\\
127 - No. What I'm saying is,\\
128 - if you want to talk like a girl, go find a girl--\\
129 - and take this with you.\\
130 - See? It is funny. MALCOLM: Ow.\\
131 - The 4400 has\\
132 - the dual-speed rinse cycle?\\
133 - Mm-hmm. No. No, I placed my order four days ago.\\
134 - I just like talking about it.\\
135 - Hi, Dewey. How was school?\\
136 - Good. Great.\\
137 - I was definitely there.\\
138 - Eight times five-- 40.\\
139 - What are you...?\\
140 - Hello?\\
141 - Hi, honey. What have you heard?\\
142 - You're kidding.\\
143 - Well, who was at the meeting?\\
144 - Everybody.\\
145 - People have been running in and out\\
146 - of the boardroom all day.\\
147 - No, I've just been playing Tetris.\\
148 - Oop. Here he comes.\\
149 - Hal.\\
150 - Mr. Fortinberry.\\
151 - Could you pull my jacket up over my head?\\
152 - Sure.\\
153 - Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.\\
154 - It's unbelievable.\\
155 - The whole company is under investigation.\\
156 - They used the pension fund\\
157 - to buy a recording studio for the CEO's girlfriend.\\
158 - Oh, Hal, this is horrible.\\
159 - Okay, okay. Don't worry about this.\\
160 - We're going to figure this out somehow.\\
161 - Hello, Gene, it's Lois.\\
162 - Order 387669289-1--\\
163 - I'm afraid I have to cancel.\\
164 - Great.\\
165 - The Flagstaff Elks\\
166 - just canceled their convention here.\\
167 - Who can blame them?\\
168 - That review was horrible.\\
169 - Hey, Otto.\\
170 - How's it going? We going to get out of the robe today?\\
171 - Innkeeper of the Year?\\
172 - Hmm.\\
173 - It is the lie of the century.\\
174 - Otto, what are you doing?\\
175 - You worked hard for that award.\\
176 - What was that, Francis?\\
177 - I couldn't hear you\\
178 - over the crackle of my failure.\\
179 - I have dreams where I sing.\\
180 - Really high, like that Saturday Night Fever guy.\\
181 - Okay.\\
182 - Well, you were sort of asking me about, you know, stuff.\\
183 - I thought you wanted to know.\\
184 - I do want to know.\\
185 - Is your head cold?\\
186 - Mine is.\\
187 - No. It's okay.\\
188 - So, you were singing in this dream?\\
189 - Yeah.\\
190 - And there were all these clouds around me.\\
191 - You like clouds?\\
192 - Yeah, I like clouds.\\
193 - I call them sky kittens.\\
194 - This is so weird.\\
195 - I've never told any of this to anyone.\\
196 - It's like you're another wishing hole.\\
197 - What's a wishing hole?\\
198 - You don't have a wishing hole? No.\\
199 - Oh, man, you got to get one.\\
200 - Mine's in a tree on Jefferson Street.\\
201 - You can ask your wishing hole for anything.\\
202 - It never calls you stupid or perv.\\
203 - My hole always keeps my wishes safe.\\
204 - It's like a bank for wishes.\\
205 - It's extraordinary footage.\\
206 - Yeah, but I only got it\\
207 - by doing something totally dishonest.\\
208 - I'm not doing this anymore.\\
209 - What? Why would you stop now\\
210 - when you could go so much deeper?\\
211 - He took me to his wishing hole.\\
212 - Malcolm,\\
213 - he wants to talk to you.\\
214 - Be his friend.\\
215 - He trusted me, and I exploited him.\\
216 - That's called being a good interviewer.\\
217 - It's called being a liar. He's my brother.\\
218 - I'm not giving you another assignment.\\
219 - Fine. I'll just make up the class in summer school.\\
220 - But I quit.\\
221 - There are... 50 kinds...\\
222 - of negative...\\
223 - trans...\\
224 - ference.\\
225 - Starting with...\\
226 - Well done, Stevie.\\
227 - I think we can all just fill in the blanks from there.\\
228 - Now, we have just enough time for one more presentation.\\
229 - And our friend Malcolm\\
230 - is going to amaze us with a fascinating update\\
231 - of the Milgram Experiment.\\
232 - Milgram Experiment?\\
233 - Oh, something you don't know, Malcolm.\\
234 - The Milgram Experiment\\
235 - was a lesson in the power of authority.\\
236 - A subject was asked by a man in a lab coat\\
237 - to administer an electric shock to a third party.\\
238 - Milgram proved that people will blindly\\
239 - follow an authority figure\\
240 - even if it means harming an innocent stranger.\\
241 - What are you doing? In our version,\\
242 - the stranger will be replaced by a close family member.\\
243 - And the electric shock will be replaced\\
244 - by devastating emotional trauma.\\
245 - Let's watch.\\
246 - Yeah, I like clouds.\\
247 - I call them sky kittens.\\
248 - It's troubling, isn't it?\\
249 - How willing someone is to sell out his own brother,\\
250 - knowing full well that it's exactly that kind\\
251 - of juicy gossip that would compel\\
252 - each of you to run into the quad\\
253 - and spread this throughout the school like wildfire.\\
254 - Hey, that is not...\\
255 - Malcolm, I am teaching.\\
256 - It's called being a liar.\\
257 - He's my brother.\\
258 - And I exploited him.\\
259 - A liar. He's my brother.\\
260 - And I exploited him. And I exploited him.\\
261 - You never said you were taping me.\\
262 - I never said I was taping him.\\
263 - I wish Malcolm and I will be friends forever.\\
264 - Breathtaking, isn't it?\\
265 - Now, none of us can know\\
266 - if we would do that to a loved one just because\\
267 - a man in a proverbial lab coat asked us to.\\
268 - All we can know for certain...\\
269 - is that Malcolm did.\\
270 - Tomorrow, Katy reports\\
271 - on post-traumatic stress disorder in fruit flies.\\
272 - Hey! You made me look like a total jerk!\\
273 - You tricked me!\\
274 - Tricked you? Oh, how could I,\\
275 - a humble school administrator making low five figures,\\
276 - be any match for the great\\
277 - and powerful Malcolm?\\
278 - Never underestimate your adversary!\\
279 - You may consider yourself my moral and intellectual superior,\\
280 - but this has clearly proven you are neither.\\
281 - We played the game and I won.\\
282 - Well, it looks as if neither of us\\
283 - is going anywhere for a while.\\
284 - Perhaps I said some things\\
285 - that you may have taken the wrong way.\\
286 - Anyway, I bought you something.\\
287 - Name-brand fabric softener.\\
288 - Oh, look at this.\\
289 - Our chief financial officer had his dog\\
290 - on the board of directors.\\
291 - I had to cc him on every memo.\\
292 - Mom, Dad,\\
293 - I have a question about school.\\
294 - Let's say you're making a lot of money.\\
295 - I mean, so much money\\
296 - that the idea of going to school is...\\
297 - You have to go to school.\\
298 - But what if you're already making,\\
299 - like, $400 or $500 a week?\\
300 - Yeah, Dewey,\\
301 - you start making $400 or $500 a week,\\
302 - you can quit school.\\
303 - Okay.\\
304 - This is an official apology.\\
305 - I'm a terrible person and I'm sorry.\\
306 - What I did was horrible even by our standards.\\
307 - And let's face it,\\
308 - we've set the bar pretty low.\\
309 - Look, I'm begging you.\\
310 - Tell me what I can do to fix it, anything.\\
311 - Just, just say it and I'll do it.\\
312 - Sure.\\
313 - Fly backwards around the Earth like Superman\\
314 - and turn back time\\
315 - to before I thought we liked each other.\\
316 - I still can't believe\\
317 - you convinced the newspaper\\
318 - to give us another review.\\
319 - Honey, you of all people know how persuasive I can be.\\
320 - You cried.\\
321 - Like a baby.\\
322 - He is here!\\
323 - Everyone, act normal!\\
324 - Welcome to the Grotto.\\
325 - Ah, the Grotto.\\
326 - Upon entering, one wonders which of the five senses\\
327 - is most brutally violated.\\
328 - Did you have a nice drive up?\\
329 - Sight and smell immediately burst into the lead\\
330 - as the obsequious innkeeper offers his sweaty slab of a hand\\
331 - like a bear taught to be friendly\\
332 - in hopes of a sugar cube.\\
333 - Mr. Cutler, if you would just give us a chance...\\
334 - And the pleading vultures immediately begin to circle.\\
335 - Their outlet mall attire creating such a vortex\\
336 - of misery that one loses the strength to even ask\\
337 - for a parking validation.\\
338 - I'll take that for you, sir.\\
339 - In a pathetic nod to diversity,\\
340 - they trot out the token native employee.\\
341 - Uh, that's my wife.\\
342 - Not content to merely ruin the vacations\\
343 - of a single generation,\\
344 - some of the employees decide to mate and breed.\\
345 - The mind reels, the thought of an endless stream\\
346 - of baboon-like hoteliers spewed out of the loins of the...\\
347 - Otto, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.\\
348 - It was like someone else was punching him.\\
349 - Yeah, it was me.\\
350 - Here's some of his hair\\
351 - if you need to put it on ice or something.\\
352 - One recalls fiercer butt-kickings\\
353 - meted out on a preschool playground.\\
354 - The wounds are superficial,\\
355 - the bruising patterns unpersuasive.\\
356 - And never before has one seen such a grotesque ceiling.\\
357 - And frankly, blue is not your...\\
358 - Hey, there's Mr. Curtis!\\
359 - See, he's using Pete the muffin guy as a human shield.\\
360 - Come on.\\
361 - There's just a pair of socks in there.\\
362 - What are you doing?\\
363 - Oh, my God!\\
364 - Look at all this money.\\
365 - Hal, when did you hide this in here?\\
366 - I don't remember.\\
367 - It must have been years ago.\\
368 - Is this my Jet Ski fund?\\
369 - No, no. We used that to get the remote control out of Reese.\\
370 - There's got to be like a thousand dollars!\\
371 - $1,473.\\
372 - Who cares what it's from!\\
373 - Thank God it's here!\\
374 - You're a part of this moment, son.\\
375 - Here, buy yourself a pack of baseball cards.\\
376 - Ow!\\
377 - Why'd you do that?\\
378 - Why you do that?!\\
379 - Fight, fight, fight!\\
380 - Fight, fight, fight!\\
381 - Animals.\\
382 - Hello, North High students. This is Malcolm.\\
383 - You all know the horrible thing I did to my brother Reese.\\
384 - And I'd like to publicly apologize\\
385 - for turning him into a laughingstock.\\
386 - I should never have exposed his secrets.\\
387 - And I can't turn back time.\\
388 - I can, however, level the playing field.\\
389 - I have been having impure thoughts\\
390 - about Shirley the lunch lady.\\
391 - Last month, I caught a glimpse\\
392 - of her cleavage\\
393 - and I've been fantasizing about her ever since.\\
394 - And now that I've admitted that,\\
395 - I'm just as big a laughingstock as he is.\\
396 - Unfortunately, that doesn't protect him\\
397 - from the rest of the school.\\
398 - So I'm forced to bring everyone down to our level.\\
399 - Let's take a look at everyone's\\
400 - permanent records.\\
401 - First up,\\
402 - David Abernathy.\\
403 - He wasn't on a construction crew this summer.\\
404 - He was in theater camp.\\
405 - Cheryl Adams\\
406 - is excused from gym this week\\
407 - because her herpes is flaring up.\\
408 - Charlie Agnew wets his bed every night during finals.\\
409 - Leslie Albert forged her parents' signatures\\
410 - to get a nose job.\\
411 - Well, Mr. Zyzyx, I'd say we have a half an hour\\
412 - to erase everything on your hard drive.\\
413 - James Allen...\\
414 - James Allen, he likes to eat his...\\
415 - What's all this?\\
416 - Did you see the paper! It is wonderful!\\
417 - He actually gave us a good review?\\
418 - There is no review.\\
419 - They bumped it for a much more interesting story.\\
420 - "Crazed local attacks reviewer"?\\
421 - But what's with all the flowers?\\
422 - They are thank-yous from restaurants and hotels\\
423 - and art galleries.\\
424 - Charles Cutler is the most hated man in the state.\\
425 - And look at these room reservations.\\
426 - Other hotels have sent us their overflow.\\
427 - We are booked solid through May.\\
428 - I can't believe this guy.\\
429 - He actually reviewed the hospital.\\
430 - Oh, yeah, it sounds terrible.\\
431 - I'm never going there.\\
432 - If you overload it, you'll burn out the motor.\\
433 - You're only supposed to use two caps of...\\
434 - Aw, just let me do it.\\
435 - Well, I served my three weeks suspension,\\
436 - and I got to say things have really changed.\\
437 - I think I might have created\\
438 - the most polite high school in America.\\
439 - For the most part.\\
440 - Hey, plagiarizer.\\
441 - Hey, pukes-after-she-eats.\\
442 - Hey, dad-had-a-breakdown- 'cause-mom-went-lesbian.\\
443 - He actually has an amazing memory for this kind of stuff.
\subsection {Episode 06: Malcolm's Job}
1 - Oh, right.\\
2 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
3 -     I don't know    \\
4 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
5 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
6 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     And you're not so big    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     And you're not so big    \\
13 -     Life is unfair.    \\
14 - There. That's it.\\
15 - I made your bed every day for a year.\\
16 - Wow. Congratulations. I can't believe you actually did it.\\
17 - According to our deal, that means from now on\\
18 - I get to sleep in this bed.\\
19 - That wasn't exactly our deal, Dewey.\\
20 - Yes, it was. You promised that if I did it,\\
21 - I'd get the bed every day after that.\\
22 - Right. Every  day,\\
23 - but I still get it at night.\\
24 - That's not fair!\\
25 - I don't know, Dewey.\\
26 - His case sounds pretty solid to me.\\
27 - Oh, and, Dewey,\\
28 - I don't want to ruin it by being too specific,\\
29 - but something you wear now has some kind of creature in it.\\
30 - Jamie's making such strides.\\
31 - He's so in touch with his emotions.\\
32 - I wish I could be more like that\\
33 - and just cry for hours and hours.\\
34 - Oh, here's the flyer\\
35 - for the "daddy and child" class I'll be teaching\\
36 - at the rec center.\\
37 - Polly, this is\\
38 - the fifth flyer you've given me.\\
39 - I'm sorry, I was just so excited.\\
40 - It was such a revelation to me that I should be teaching.\\
41 - I've always tried\\
42 - to follow my bliss, but up until now\\
43 - my blisses have turned out to be\\
44 - treacherous and self-destructive.\\
45 - Can't wait.\\
46 - Do I really have to...\\
47 - Yes, Hal.\\
48 - Boys, I wanted to talk to you.\\
49 - I've got some good news. I've been thinking.\\
50 - You're both growing up.\\
51 - You're showing a lot more maturity these days.\\
52 - I think you've earned the right\\
53 - to a little bit more independence.\\
54 - We're getting a car!\\
55 - You're both getting jobs.\\
56 - What? What?\\
57 - Malcolm, I talked to the manager of the Lucky Aide this morning.\\
58 - You start there tomorrow.\\
59 - You want me to work\\
60 - at your store? With you?\\
61 - Yes. Reese-- since you've been mentioned six times\\
62 - by name in the security handbook,\\
63 - you have to look for a job somewhere else,\\
64 - but I want you in a paper hat by the end of the week.\\
65 - Please don't do this to me.\\
66 - Just let me find my own job.\\
67 - Malcolm, it's already done.\\
68 - I had to call in\\
69 - a lot of favors with Mr. Young for you.\\
70 - You are not going to make me look bad\\
71 - by not honoring your commitments.\\
72 - How is it my commitment?!\\
73 - Because I'm your mother and you're doing it. That's final.\\
74 - I was thinking there's a lot of germs flying around.\\
75 - Dad, Mom has this stupid idea about working...\\
76 - Huh! Huh! Huh! That's enough!\\
77 - You boys heard your mother.\\
78 - We have always said\\
79 - you have to concentrate on your schoolwork\\
80 - before wasting your time on dead-end jobs.\\
81 - You have got your whole life to work\\
82 - and only one chance to learn.\\
83 - I told them to get jobs, Hal.\\
84 - The value of hard work.\\
85 - Money doesn't grow on trees.\\
86 - The sooner you two kids have jobs, the better.\\
87 - My first paycheck, I'm buying this house\\
88 - and kicking them out.\\
89 - As we emerge from the cocoon of self-doubt...\\
90 - reaching for unconditional affirmation...\\
91 - defeating our inner critics.\\
92 - And rest.\\
93 - See, daddies can be just as good mommies as mommies.\\
94 - Oh! I have to make a quick phone call\\
95 - to the parole officer.\\
96 - Oh, don't worry, it's not about me.\\
97 - It's about one of my dads, but while I'm gone,\\
98 - why don't you do that "baby-ssage" thing I showed you.\\
99 - You know, babies feel stress, too.\\
100 - Man, I'm so bored I can feel my own hair growing.\\
101 - Maybe I should wait a couple years to bond with Jamie.\\
102 - It's got to be easier when he can do more than\\
103 - just burble and sit up.\\
104 - Your baby can sit up?\\
105 - For how long?\\
106 - I don't know. Ten seconds?\\
107 - My baby can sit up for 20.\\
108 - Jasmine can do it for 30.\\
109 - Oh, yeah?\\
110 - Do it, Jamie. Come on, buddy, you can do it!\\
111 - Do it for Daddy.\\
112 - Do it for Daddy.\\
113 - Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.\\
114 - One more. One more.\\
115 - Come on, baby. Come on, baby.\\
116 - Come on, baby, you can...\\
117 - Yes! Way to go, Jamie.\\
118 - I think this belongs to me.\\
119 - Hello, you've reached The Grotto. Please hold.\\
120 - Hello, you've reached The Grotto. Please hold.\\
121 - Hello, you've reached The Grotto.\\
122 - You are a terrible brother!\\
123 - Dewey? Malcolm and Reese do nothing\\
124 - but torture me all day long.\\
125 - My life is horrible and it's not fair!\\
126 - Dewey, you're not making any sense.\\
127 - You were nice to Malcolm and Reese\\
128 - but then you got kicked out before I was even old enough\\
129 - to know what was going on.\\
130 - So they got to have a good big brother\\
131 - and all I got was  them.\\
132 - Look, I'm sorry, okay, I just, I don't live there anymore.\\
133 - I don't care!\\
134 - You have to make this up to me. I deserve\\
135 - a good big brother, too.\\
136 - Dewey, I know this is\\
137 - really important to you,\\
138 - but I just don't have the time right now,\\
139 - so I'll call you in a couple days, okay?\\
140 - No, do not hang up on me.\\
141 - Don't you look handsome? My little working man's\\
142 - first day on the job.\\
143 - Do not do anything to mess this up.\\
144 - Our whole family needs me\\
145 - to have this job.\\
146 - Don't worry, Mom, if it will save the family,\\
147 - I won't stack the toilet paper sideways.\\
148 - Those kinds of wisenheimer remarks\\
149 - are exactly what I'm talking about. Now go.\\
150 - You don't want to be late for the training session.\\
151 - Hello, I'm Dale Young, district supervisor.\\
152 - Now, we're going to have a lot of Lucky Aide fun today,\\
153 - but there's also a lot for our new trainees to learn.\\
154 - Not to mention our employees who need a little refresher.\\
155 - What is this, Feldspar-- the fifth time?\\
156 - We can call it that.\\
157 - You leave the store unlocked one night,\\
158 - it's like the sky fell in.\\
159 - Mr. Feldspar, I'm sure you don't want\\
160 - to get your fellow trainee in trouble.\\
161 - You must be Malcolm, Lois' boy.\\
162 - Hey, tell me,\\
163 - is Beans as much fun at home\\
164 - as she is at work?\\
165 - Who? Hey, Dave,\\
166 - can you picture Beans having kids?\\
167 - Beans?\\
168 - Now, we're gonna start with a little instructional video,\\
169 - and then I hope everyone has their role-playing hats on.\\
170 - Lucky Aide--\\
171 - It's another word for "family," and like family,\\
172 - we all pull in the same direction,\\
173 - toward the same goal, from the lowliest stock boy...\\
174 - to the district managers... all the way up to the president.\\
175 - Was that...?\\
176 - We're proud of our 95% employee retention rate.\\
177 - You may think you're just starting a job,\\
178 - but when you join the Lucky Aide family,\\
179 - you're here for life.\\
180 - Mr. Young said you did great in training.\\
181 - Well, what can I say, Beans?\\
182 - Oh, I'm sorry, Beans.\\
183 - Did I say something wrong, Beans?\\
184 - Now, I went to a lot of trouble\\
185 - to make sure you could work with Albert.\\
186 - He really knows what he's doing.\\
187 - You're gonna learn a lot from him.\\
188 - Hey, Albert!\\
189 - This is my son, Malcolm.\\
190 - Nah, that can't be your son.\\
191 - He ain't beautiful enough.\\
192 - Did she just giggle?\\
193 - Okay, now.\\
194 - Those are empty boxes.\\
195 - Yes. They are.\\
196 - Good. Now, what you do is\\
197 - you take them in the freight elevator\\
198 - to the basement\\
199 - to the box-flattening area.\\
200 - You flatten the boxes,\\
201 - then take them back up the elevator,\\
202 - go out by the loading dock and throw them in the Dumpster.\\
203 - I figure, it's about six or seven trips.\\
204 - Shouldn't take you more than two hours.\\
205 - That Dumpster right over there?\\
206 - Yes.\\
207 - If I flatten them here, I can\\
208 - be done in, like, 20 minutes.\\
209 - You take them in the freight elevator to the basement\\
210 - to the box-flattening area.\\
211 - No, I got it. I was just wondering if...\\
212 - I understand.\\
213 - So I broke down the boxes right next to the Dumpster\\
214 - and saved so much time\\
215 - I was able to sweep out the stock room\\
216 - and do a whole week's worth of returns.\\
217 - That's great. Sounds like you had a good first day.\\
218 - So, what part\\
219 - of "box-flattening area" don't you understand?\\
220 - Huh?\\
221 - You were seen flattening boxes\\
222 - outside of the designated box-flattening area.\\
223 - I thought I made myself clear.\\
224 - Why even have a box-flattening area\\
225 - if you don't flatten the boxes there?\\
226 - But it only took me 20 minutes, so I was able to... Mom.\\
227 - Albert, I'm sorry.\\
228 - I'll write him up.\\
229 - What? But you just said that...\\
230 - You're supposed to do as you're told.\\
231 - Thanks for taking the heat off me.\\
232 - I forgot my shoes again.\\
233 - This is ridiculous! You're being completely arbitrary and asinine.\\
234 - One minute you're telling me I'm\\
235 - doing a great job, and the next minute\\
236 - you're writing me up!\\
237 - You broke the rules, Malcolm.\\
238 - Come on, that box-flattening area is a stupid rule.\\
239 - You know I'm right.\\
240 - Albert is a grade-five employee.\\
241 - He has put in 20 years of service time.\\
242 - Sometimes that's more important\\
243 - than what's right or wrong.\\
244 - Who  are  you?\\
245 - Stop being so melodramatic.\\
246 - No, seriously, I want to know.\\
247 - Because the mother I know\\
248 - has spent her entire life ranting\\
249 - about always doing the right thing, no matter what the cost,\\
250 - no matter how unpopular it is,\\
251 - and now you're standing here\\
252 - getting all caught up in who's a grade five\\
253 - and blindly obeying authority.\\
254 - Honestly, Malcolm, where'd you get the idea\\
255 - that a job is supposed to be fun?\\
256 - That's not what I'm talking about!\\
257 - The truth is, work is hard and miserable\\
258 - and nobody likes doing it.\\
259 - I have the greatest job in the world!\\
260 - You got a job?\\
261 - Yeah, with Hygienic Meat Packing.\\
262 - All I do all day is cut meat.\\
263 - With knives and saws.\\
264 - There's blood everywhere\\
265 - and there's all these guys swearing in Spanish,\\
266 - and they pay me 12 bucks an hour!\\
267 - 12 bucks an hour? I only make $5.50.\\
268 - Actually,\\
269 - with the write-up, you're bumped down to $3.75.\\
270 - Now you better go finish your homework.\\
271 - Dinner's in a half an hour.\\
272 - I am so proud of you guys.\\
273 - You're so open to connecting with your babies.\\
274 - If my dads were like you,\\
275 - I'm sure I wouldn't have slept with so many men in college.\\
276 - See you next class.\\
277 - We can't wait.\\
278 - Okay, I've got Jamie to win and Kevin to show.\\
279 - Jamie's diaper...\\
280 - Two pounds. Yes!\\
281 - Dakota...\\
282 - Two and a quarter pounds. Yes.\\
283 - Jasmine...\\
284 - Four pounds?\\
285 - Man, that's unholy.\\
286 - I am so sorry\\
287 - I was ever disappointed you were born a girl.\\
288 - Reese, this meat is delicious. Thank you.\\
289 - Malcolm, would you like another piece?\\
290 - I don't think I'm authorized to make that decision.\\
291 - Maybe we should ask a grade-five employee.\\
292 - Hey, I'm a grade-five employee.\\
293 - Wow. How do they get\\
294 - the meat this tender?\\
295 - Well, that's the thing about veal.\\
296 - Imagine if you took Jamie and put him in a little box\\
297 - where he would never see daylight.\\
298 - You don't let him move so his muscles don't get all tough.\\
299 - He's basically blind and you force-feed him nothing but milk.\\
300 - That's what makes him taste so good.\\
301 - Hal, how did Jamie\\
302 - do in class today?\\
303 - Fine. I guess.\\
304 - For a kid who can't fill a diaper.\\
305 - This is strange. Why would we have\\
306 - so many leftovers?\\
307 - You hung up on me!\\
308 - What are you doing here? I told you.\\
309 - I can't handle Reese and Malcolm anymore.\\
310 - I need a good big brother\\
311 - before it's too late!\\
312 - I'm like one wedgie away from an eating disorder.\\
313 - You're here by yourself?\\
314 - Francis, please, all I want is a few minutes\\
315 - of someone being nice to me.\\
316 - Is that really\\
317 - such a big thing for a kid my age to ask?\\
318 - Dad, Dad, Dad, calm down. He's fine.\\
319 - I have the day off Saturday.\\
320 - I'll bring him home then.\\
321 - You gotta give him credit, you know.\\
322 - He got to the ranch all by himself.\\
323 - The first time you tried, you ended up in Mexico.\\
324 - Of course, I'd be happy\\
325 - to carry your bags outside.\\
326 - We wouldn't want you\\
327 - to get all hot and sweaty\\
328 - out in the blaring heat of the parking lot.\\
329 - Malcolm. You're not scheduled for today.\\
330 - I'm just looking for my mom.\\
331 - She's out back on her break.\\
332 - Last night, Mom accused me\\
333 - of being obsessive about getting written up.\\
334 - So I stayed up all last night\\
335 - thinking up a bunch of comebacks,\\
336 - and I even have potential comebacks\\
337 - to every possible comeback of hers. There is no way she...\\
338 - You're smoking?!\\
339 - After all the times you lectured us?\\
340 - After telling us if we smoked,\\
341 - you would kill us before the cancer did?!\\
342 - After you would push Francis'\\
343 - lit cigarettes back in his mouth\\
344 - and make him swallow?! And you smoke?!\\
345 - You smoke?!\\
346 - Look, it's not what you think.\\
347 - When I work,\\
348 - I have two cigarettes--\\
349 - one on my morning break, one in the afternoon.\\
350 - No more, no less.\\
351 - Who are you?!\\
352 - You have to stop saying that.\\
353 - I will quit eventually,\\
354 - but until then, the only thing\\
355 - that's stopping your father\\
356 - from smoking six packs a day\\
357 - is knowing that we quit together.\\
358 - But you didn't quit.\\
359 - But he knows I did.\\
360 - But you didn't!\\
361 - He knows I did.\\
362 - You lie and you smoke.\\
363 - Oh, for God's sake, Malcolm.\\
364 - Lois, Lois, I just remembered\\
365 - you were holding my lit cigarette in your hand,\\
366 - and I wanted to thank you\\
367 - for holding on to my cigarettes...\\
368 - which are mine.\\
369 - He knows. Okay.\\
370 - I think I left my register open.\\
371 - Okay, Malcolm, you caught me.\\
372 - This has to be kept secret.\\
373 - So I'm going to ask you for a favor.\\
374 - A favor?\\
375 - You're asking me for a favor\\
376 - after you totally hung me out to dry.\\
377 - I'm just asking for a little flexibility.\\
378 - Please.\\
379 - For your father and for me,\\
380 - just keep the smoking to yourself.\\
381 - Please.\\
382 - Yeah, okay.\\
383 - Wow, she's talking to me like a human being.\\
384 - This can't get any weirder.\\
385 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
386 - Yes, it can.\\
387 - I can't believe I used to think\\
388 - that taking care of the baby was a chore.\\
389 - This class has really opened my eyes.\\
390 - Time.\\
391 - Aiden wins again.\\
392 - I knew I shouldn't let you have that cracker.\\
393 - I'll pay you next class.\\
394 - I got to go.\\
395 - You're not going to stick around\\
396 - for the suction contest?\\
397 - Will you take a watch?\\
398 - Don't get too down about this probation thing.\\
399 - This job is mostly a beauty pageant.\\
400 - You know what's weird?\\
401 - You get used to thinking of a person as being\\
402 - so much more powerful than you,\\
403 - then something shifts and it becomes kind of awkward.\\
404 - Oh, my God, are you my boss now?! What?\\
405 - This is so unfair.\\
406 - Year after year,\\
407 - why can't...\\
408 - It's nice to see one of the good guys win.\\
409 - Why don't you take a load off.\\
410 - I'll go get you a cup of joe.\\
411 - No worries, chief.\\
412 - Whoa.\\
413 - Malcolm.\\
414 - It's not what it looks like.\\
415 - Lois, sorry, are you in there?\\
416 - I'll explain later.\\
417 - I know exactly what this looks like to you,\\
418 - but I'm asking you for a little flexibility.\\
419 - Trust me.\\
420 - Lois, where's the...?\\
421 - What's going on here?\\
422 - Well, I'll have to write Malcolm up again.\\
423 - He's flattened\\
424 - another box\\
425 - outside of the box flattening area.\\
426 - The guys at work are great.\\
427 - I already have a nickname-- Ten Fingers.\\
428 - The old Ten Fingers wasn't using it anymore.\\
429 - I'm proud of you, son.\\
430 - You're working now.\\
431 - I feel like I could talk to you, man to man.\\
432 - You know, about grown up things--\\
433 - expenses...\\
434 - cheaters...\\
435 - Can I borrow some money from you?\\
436 - Yeah. How much do you need?\\
437 - Uh... how much do you have?\\
438 - Why don't you just tell me how much you need.\\
439 - 100... 2...\\
440 - and another 100.\\
441 - You might want to rinse off the bills in cold water.\\
442 - They stick together.\\
443 - It was so cool when that guy at the truck stop\\
444 - blew the smoke ring out of the hole in his throat.\\
445 - That was fun, wasn't it?\\
446 - How come you're the only good one in the family?\\
447 - Why didn't any of it\\
448 - rub off on Reese or Malcolm?\\
449 - Dewey, would you cut it out?\\
450 - No, I mean it. You're such a good brother.\\
451 - I'll bet they didn't even appreciate it.\\
452 - Dewey! I was never like this with Reese and Malcolm.\\
453 - I treated them like crap.\\
454 - Way worse than they treat you.\\
455 - That's impossible.\\
456 - I tortured them all the time. I beat them up,\\
457 - I took their stuff,\\
458 - I locked them in closets.\\
459 - You know that scar on Reese's back?\\
460 - That's from a bayonet.\\
461 - Where did I even get a bayonet?!\\
462 - But you couldn't have.\\
463 - The way they talk about you... They love you so much.\\
464 - Dewey, let me let you in on a little secret.\\
465 - Sometimes people love people for no reason.\\
466 - Like Whoopi Goldberg.\\
467 - Hmm.\\
468 - It's even weirder with brothers.\\
469 - So you're saying...\\
470 - I'm the only one you were ever nice to?\\
471 - Pretty much.\\
472 - You know, you have a real opportunity here.\\
473 - You can break the cycle.\\
474 - You can be a good brother to Jamie.\\
475 - You can be the one kid in this family\\
476 - who takes care of the younger one and looks out for him.\\
477 - How is that fair?\\
478 - Yeah, you're right.\\
479 - Trying to impress\\
480 - the cool kids?\\
481 - Hey, Malcolm. Good news.\\
482 - The head of security told me\\
483 - that the surveillance cameras proved\\
484 - you didn't flatten that box on purpose.\\
485 - You're also using too much soap in the bathroom.\\
486 - Anyway, you're off probation.\\
487 - Wow, thanks for going to the mat for me.\\
488 - What is your problem?\\
489 - My problem is, I have no idea who you are.\\
490 - I thought I had this mother\\
491 - that was abrupt and short-tempered and rude,\\
492 - but who at least would stand up for what's right.\\
493 - That's not who you are.\\
494 - I did something nice for you,\\
495 - and you act like it didn't even happen.\\
496 - You did something nice for me\\
497 - because it was the right thing to do.\\
498 - I'm simply making you obey rules because I'm your mother.\\
499 - That's not fair.\\
500 - If this favor thing doesn't work both ways,\\
501 - then why am I keeping a big secret for you?\\
502 - Why shouldn't I just tell Dad?\\
503 - You're not going to tell your father.\\
504 - How do you know?\\
505 - Because, Malcolm, that's not who you are.\\
506 - Why do you do this to me?\\
507 - Malcolm, I know this is hard for you.\\
508 - You're growing up.\\
509 - You're sick of living under my authority.\\
510 - You want me to cut you some slack.\\
511 - You're wondering when I'll finally\\
512 - see you as an adult.\\
513 - Well... that's never going to happen.\\
514 - That's just not the way\\
515 - it works.\\
516 - You can move away from home,\\
517 - you can get married, even have kids of your own,\\
518 - you can even become a professor of physics at MIT.\\
519 - I will always be your mother.\\
520 - And that's just the way it is until one of us dies.\\
521 - You want to put your head\\
522 - between your knees for a few seconds?\\
523 - No, I'm okay.\\
524 - Look...\\
525 - will you please\\
526 - just give me one thing?\\
527 - Please stop smoking.\\
528 - I already quit.\\
529 - Are you lying?\\
530 - Of course not.\\
531 - Okay, Jamie.\\
532 - It all comes down to this.\\
533 - Just do it like we practiced in the garage.\\
534 - Go, go, go.\\
535 - We've got the whole family together.\\
536 - We should celebrate with a nice dinner at...\\
537 - Pay up, suckers!\\
538 - You treated your babies\\
539 - like they were made of glass,\\
540 - and now you suffer.\\
541 - What are you waiting for?\\
542 - I want to remember that goofy smile.\\
543 - Nobody's going to be seeing that for a long time.\\
544 - Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Look at me! Whoo-hoo!
\subsection {Episode 07: Christmas Trees}
1 - Oh, honey, I can't do any more tonight.\\
2 - Let's just leave the mess and get some sleep, huh?\\
3 - Wait a minute, we bought ten presents.\\
4 - Yeah?\\
5 - Why are there 11 packages?\\
6 - Oh, my God.\\
7 - Oh... we would have figured it out\\
8 - before we mailed it, right?\\
9 - Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.\\
10 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
11 -     I don't know    \\
12 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     And you're not so big    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     And you're not so big    \\
21 -     Life is unfair.    \\
22 - Don't move.\\
23 - Ow! Did you get it?\\
24 - Get what?\\
25 - It's three weeks till Christmas,\\
26 - and Reese is holding off hitting Dewey\\
27 - till after the holidays.\\
28 - Well,\\
29 - guess what?\\
30 - I got two weeks forced vacation without pay.\\
31 - What?! Thanks to the company's trouble\\
32 - with the government, they sent everybody home\\
33 - till the new year.\\
34 - We think it's just so the board members\\
35 - can shred documents in peace.\\
36 - Two weeks without pay? At Christmas?!\\
37 - That means no presents.\\
38 - December 2.\\
39 - Refused to eat booger sandwich.\\
40 - I know this is coming at a bad time,\\
41 - but I think I have a plan\\
42 - that'll make us enough money to get through this.\\
43 - I'm going to sell Christmas trees.\\
44 - What? In college,\\
45 - I sold Christmas trees every December\\
46 - with my roommate Victor.\\
47 - I thought he sold illegal cable boxes.\\
48 - To pay for the Christmas trees.\\
49 - We made a killing.\\
50 - Look, I've already talked to a supplier.\\
51 - We have enough to buy 130 trees at 15 bucks apiece.\\
52 - Oh, and Ed from the office\\
53 - is letting me use his vacant lot for free.\\
54 - Really?\\
55 - If we sell them at six bucks a foot--\\
56 - that's an average of $45 a tree-- Lois,\\
57 - we can net over $2,600.\\
58 - Well, if you think it'll work.\\
59 - Hey, Reese and I have some money saved up.\\
60 - If we go in on this, we can get 200 trees.\\
61 - We'd make $4,000.\\
62 - You'd put your own money in?\\
63 - Sure. I was going to invest mine\\
64 - with this Nigerian General who's been sending me e-mails,\\
65 - but, hey, this is family.\\
66 - Really?\\
67 - You boys would actually\\
68 - go into business with your old man?\\
69 - I never dreamed anything like this would be possible.\\
70 - Dad... When I was a kid,\\
71 - I begged my dad to go into business with me\\
72 - a bunch of times, but he never answered the intercom.\\
73 - And now you boys\\
74 - want to go into business with me.\\
75 - It'll be like a Korean grocery store!\\
76 - You know, Dewey,\\
77 - you've got $20 in your piggy bank.\\
78 - I think they've got it covered, Mom.\\
79 - All right. I'm in.\\
80 - It's gonna be weird not being with our families on Christmas.\\
81 - I know. It feels...\\
82 - great!\\
83 - It's like all the ugliness and turmoil\\
84 - you always associate with Christmas is gone.\\
85 - My family! They are finally here!\\
86 - All the way from Stuttgart!\\
87 - "Don't pack your heavy clothes.\\
88 - It's not cold in the desert."\\
89 - I'm freezing off my ass!\\
90 - Stop whining! I already\\
91 - have two children; I don't need a third!\\
92 - Oh, come on, you two.\\
93 - You're here now. Just enjoy.\\
94 - Oh, I forgot.\\
95 - Everything has to be perfect with Gretchen.\\
96 - Don't you raise\\
97 - your voice to Gretchen.\\
98 - Anyone who is not an alcoholic,\\
99 - you accuse of being a perfectionist.\\
100 - Hal and Sons.\\
101 - That means you, too, Jamie.\\
102 - I know it's just a crappy wooden sign, but...\\
103 - boys, I want you to know that this is\\
104 - the greatest day of my life.\\
105 - I'm so happy\\
106 - and proud of each and every one of you,\\
107 - and I just want to make sure that you don't screw this up.\\
108 - We will have\\
109 - so many precious memories together,\\
110 - as long as you don't give in\\
111 - to your worst instincts and do something really stupid.\\
112 - I just love you\\
113 - so much,\\
114 - and I want to keep loving you.\\
115 - Dad, stop worrying. We can do this.\\
116 - With what we spent on trees and truck rental,\\
117 - we'll be in profit once we sell tree 67.\\
118 - Then let's just sell that tree first.\\
119 - What are those tools for?\\
120 - Let me show you.\\
121 - These are for setting up the trees.\\
122 - First you use\\
123 - the radial saw to cut an inch off the bottom of the trunk.\\
124 - Then you use this nail gun to stick\\
125 - the tree stand...\\
126 - Again, I am so proud of you boys\\
127 - and I don't want to lose this feeling.\\
128 - I don't know why you won't let me help you\\
129 - with that, Lois.\\
130 - Craig, please, I really don't want you to.\\
131 - Why not?\\
132 - Because every time\\
133 - you come in contact with me and my family,\\
134 - something horrible happens to you.\\
135 - I can't deal with the guilt anymore.\\
136 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
137 - Come on, if it weren't for us, you'd still have all your teeth;\\
138 - you wouldn't flinch every time you saw\\
139 - a ceiling fan; your car, it never\\
140 - would have been filled with bees.\\
141 - Coincidences.\\
142 - Craig, you broke your foot\\
143 - looking up a phone number for me.\\
144 - Please, Lois, it's Christmas.\\
145 - Here.\\
146 - Maybe you can fluff up the cotton on Santa's beard.\\
147 - Thank you.\\
148 - Ow! Oh!\\
149 - Well, I wish I could say I was surprised.\\
150 - Okay. You're all set.\\
151 - Mister, is this tree dead?\\
152 - Well, of course not.\\
153 - We made sure we cut a fresh wound in the bottom\\
154 - of your tree so it could suck up water.\\
155 - That way, your tree is suspended in a netherworld\\
156 - between life and death,\\
157 - just waiting for you to open your presents.\\
158 - How many trees have we sold?\\
159 - Fifteen. Fifteen?\\
160 - We're not anywhere close to tree 67.\\
161 - I don't get it.\\
162 - We're in a good location.\\
163 - We've got great looking trees.\\
164 - Excuse me. Hmm?\\
165 - How much are your trees?\\
166 - Six dollars a foot.\\
167 - Ah. What?\\
168 - Well, St. Mark's Church around the corner\\
169 - marked their trees down to five dollars a foot,\\
170 - but they've got such long lines, I thought I'd try you guys.\\
171 - You believe that church trying to undersell us?\\
172 - You don't see us offering Mass at half price.\\
173 - Why don't we lower the price on our trees?\\
174 - Like, down to, I don't know, $4.50 a foot?\\
175 - Then we average $31 a tree,\\
176 - and we still net... $3,457.\\
177 - We'll be profitable by-- hang on-- tree 91.\\
178 - Tree 91?\\
179 - Tree 91.\\
180 - Sir! Sir!\\
181 - Right this way.\\
182 - We've got a really nice...\\
183 - It's customary to tie the tree to the roof.\\
184 - It's customary to tip the guy who tied it.\\
185 - All right!\\
186 - That was tree 79!\\
187 - We're very close!\\
188 - Boys,\\
189 - I love all of you.\\
190 - But this kid...\\
191 - It's just a tiny bite, right?\\
192 - He's going to be okay?\\
193 - Oh, absolutely.\\
194 - Of course, he'll have to get rabies shots. Shots?\\
195 - Five injections, right in the belly.\\
196 - I had to get them when I was bitten\\
197 - by a skunk a few years ago.\\
198 - When they shoved that first four-inch needle\\
199 - into my stomach, I felt like I'd been shot in the gut.\\
200 - By the time they pulled\\
201 - the last needle out, I was on the floor,\\
202 - clutching a chair leg and crying like a baby.\\
203 - Navy Seals\\
204 - trained me to deal with pain, but...\\
205 - nothing like that.\\
206 - Well, you can always try to catch the squirrel\\
207 - and bring it to Animal Control.\\
208 - If they can confirm it doesn't have rabies,\\
209 - you could avoid the shots.\\
210 - No, I'll have to take the shots.\\
211 - Otherwise Lois can't prove her point.\\
212 - Craig, listen to me.\\
213 - I am making you this vow:\\
214 - I am going to find that squirrel\\
215 - and take it to Animal Control\\
216 - and prove it doesn't have rabies,\\
217 - so you do not have to get those shots.\\
218 - You are not going to suffer ever again for having known me.\\
219 - Understand?\\
220 - You're on my foot.\\
221 - Oh. Sorry.\\
222 - They're still at it?\\
223 - Yeah. It's fascinating.\\
224 - I've had the same argument a million times with my mom.\\
225 - Right now she's gonna say, "Don't take that tone with me,"\\
226 - and then he's gonna start screaming.\\
227 - Now the father figure tries to make peace.\\
228 - And he gets his head chopped off.\\
229 - Oh, this is a good one.\\
230 - Jumping into someone else's argument to settle an old score.\\
231 - They're like a primitive version of my family.\\
232 - Take one step to your left.\\
233 - Why?\\
234 - Spooky.\\
235 - Okay, you're getting seven dollars change, right?\\
236 - One and two and five.\\
237 - I hide the big bills where no one's gonna go after them.\\
238 - I'll help you with that.\\
239 - Okay, that is, uh, tree 89!\\
240 - Boys, we are so close, I can taste it!\\
241 - You the guys trying to muscle in on the blessed church?\\
242 - I'm sorry, what'd you say?\\
243 - We're from St. Mark's around the corner.\\
244 - You're underselling us, and we don't like it.\\
245 - So it's going to stop.\\
246 - We want you to close down\\
247 - your lot and leave. Now.\\
248 - During this holy season, it's best to give\\
249 - our Heavenly Savior what he wants.\\
250 - It might interest you to know that you're dealing\\
251 - with a bunch of godless heathens.\\
252 - Take your ghost stories somewhere else.\\
253 - We'll give you 20 minutes to clear out,\\
254 - then we take matters into our own hands.\\
255 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
256 - Don't worry about it, Dad.\\
257 - They're priests. What are they gonna do?\\
258 - Just get in the car and lock the doors!\\
259 - Spare change, mister?\\
260 - Hey, mister! Come on!\\
261 - Does this look infected to you?\\
262 - Excuse me, this is my tree.\\
263 - I already marked it, if you know what I mean.\\
264 - Wha...! Wait, no!\\
265 - What the hell do you think you're doing?\\
266 - Father McKlusky sends his regards.\\
267 - What are you talking about?\\
268 - He dropped by the soup kitchen\\
269 - and he suggested we come down here and share the magic.\\
270 - Cute kid.\\
271 - You want some homemade candy?\\
272 - Dad, everyone's leaving!\\
273 - Look... whatever St. Mark's\\
274 - is giving you, we'll double it!\\
275 - You can double eternal salvation?\\
276 - Yes, I can.\\
277 - You're funny.\\
278 - So, you sell Christmas trees?\\
279 - I used to sell Christmas trees.\\
280 - Any luck?\\
281 - What do you think?\\
282 - No one's gonna let us set up our trees.\\
283 - Unbelievable.\\
284 - You'd think a cemetery would be up for anything\\
285 - that would lighten the mood.\\
286 - Hey, why don't we just drive around\\
287 - and sell the trees out of the back of the truck?\\
288 - Of course, we have to factor in the price of gas.\\
289 - Let's see, six miles a gallon, with gas selling at two...\\
290 - Malcolm, why don't you give the genius thing\\
291 - a rest for a while?\\
292 - We were so close.\\
293 - 89 trees.\\
294 - Just two trees away from being profitable.\\
295 - Story of my life.\\
296 - No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try,\\
297 - I'm always two trees away.\\
298 - We should just sell them out of our yard.\\
299 - Reese, this is a serious problem.\\
300 - Would you please just...?\\
301 - Oh, my God.\\
302 - That wasn't stupid.\\
303 - Reese, your love for your father\\
304 - has focused your mind like a laser!\\
305 - Give him the hat.\\
306 - People, there is a squirrel\\
307 - somewhere in the store.\\
308 - He's very agile, elusive, and possibly rabid,\\
309 - but we will catch him.\\
310 - We have to.\\
311 - I've got a bad feeling about this, Lois.\\
312 - It's been too quiet for too long.\\
313 - He's planning something.\\
314 - Yes, well, I brought in reinforcements, Ethan.\\
315 - Thanks for helping, guys.\\
316 - No problem.\\
317 - Our last job finished early,\\
318 - so we had some time on our hands.\\
319 - All right then. Let's do this thing!\\
320 -        \\
321 - You people are so great!\\
322 - I'm sorry I ate all your lunches in the fridge!\\
323 - You're out there.\\
324 - I know you're out there.\\
325 - Aisle 12! He's heading for the register!\\
326 - Don't let it get away!\\
327 - He's over there!\\
328 - Wait, he's headed for the front door!\\
329 - Watch out, he's got murder in his eyes!\\
330 - And a cute, fluffy tail.\\
331 - Checkmate, chipmunk.\\
332 - And three makes ten.\\
333 - Feliz Navidad.\\
334 - So, at $3.50 a foot, the profit tree is...\\
335 - 112. 112 is the profit tree.\\
336 - Say it with me, boys.\\
337 - "112 is the profit tree."\\
338 - Hal?\\
339 - Oh, hey, Phil. Merry Christmas.\\
340 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
341 - You don't have a permit to do this.\\
342 - Get these trees off your yard.\\
343 - Phil, please. I...\\
344 - Look, I know this seems a little unusual,\\
345 - but I'm in kind of a jam.\\
346 - I was laid off, and I'm out of money.\\
347 - Come on, it's Christmas.\\
348 - I don't care.\\
349 - I hate you, and I always have.\\
350 - Phil, why don't you take a tree?\\
351 - On the house.\\
352 - Here.\\
353 - You're giving me this?\\
354 - I'll even flock it if you want.\\
355 - No, no. That's okay.\\
356 - So, we have an understanding here?\\
357 - Yeah. We have an understanding.\\
358 - You're gonna have to get these trees out of here.\\
359 - We received a complaint, and you don't have a permit.\\
360 - And he has too many garbage cans.\\
361 - That's a fineable offense, isn't it?\\
362 - He can't complain. I bribed him with a tree!\\
363 - Sir, you can't have a business\\
364 - in your front yard without a permit.\\
365 - Officer, we've sunk\\
366 - all our money into this.\\
367 - We've just got to sell one more tree to break even.\\
368 - That's all I'm asking. One tree.\\
369 - Just let me sell one tree.\\
370 - Have you got a tree?\\
371 - Coming through.\\
372 - You.\\
373 - I was never at that dog show!\\
374 - And where would a high school kid\\
375 - get a spear gun, anyway?\\
376 - This is your son? Uh...\\
377 - Well, it depends on what you mean by "son."\\
378 - You got half an hour\\
379 - to get every single one of these trees out of your yard.\\
380 - But we lost our truck!\\
381 - We don't have any place to take them.\\
382 - That's not my problem.\\
383 - You get them out,\\
384 - or you'll be spending Christmas in a jail cell.\\
385 - I can't take this.\\
386 - The yelling, the screaming...\\
387 - It's making me feel so... homesick.\\
388 - Me, too.\\
389 - My mom used to grab my dad's throat like that.\\
390 - I disown all of you!\\
391 - All of you!\\
392 - I never thought I would feel ashamed of being German.\\
393 - Huh. See? Huh?\\
394 - They're all gone.\\
395 - Are you happy now?\\
396 - Just remember,\\
397 - I'll be patrolling this block every 15 minutes.\\
398 - Merry Christmas.\\
399 - Merry Christmas.\\
400 - I want you to buy me out.\\
401 - No, Dewey, this is just a temporary setback.\\
402 - If you believe that, then buy me out.\\
403 - It's over, Dad.\\
404 - Over?\\
405 - We're only one tree away!\\
406 - Dad, we can't get the truck back.\\
407 - We can't use the front lawn.\\
408 - The cops are watching us.\\
409 - Face it, we've lost.\\
410 - So you're just going to let a little reality\\
411 - stop you, is that it?\\
412 - Boys, let me tell you something.\\
413 - The only way I've managed to get through my crappy life\\
414 - with any shred of self-worth is by living in denial.\\
415 - If I was going to let myself get beaten by failure,\\
416 - I would've quit after one kid.\\
417 - You just got to keep holding out for a miracle.\\
418 - And if a miracle isn't going to come at Christmas,\\
419 - then when is it going to come?!\\
420 - See?! There it is!\\
421 - Our Christmas miracle! I knew it!\\
422 - Hi.\\
423 - My kid found this cat. Is it yours?\\
424 - No. Would you like to buy a Christmas tree for ten dollars?\\
425 - No, we already have a tree.\\
426 - You got to help me out.\\
427 - I just yanked my boys back from the brink of despair\\
428 - and convinced them that life was worth living.\\
429 - If you walk away without handing me ten dollars,\\
430 - then their futures aren't worth a damn.\\
431 - Now, I desperately need to teach them\\
432 - the value of perseverance, and you can help me.\\
433 - I don't think...\\
434 - I'll lick your shoes.\\
435 - Have you ever actually seen someone do that? I haven't.\\
436 - That's got to be worth ten dollars. I'll even...\\
437 - Here, take the money.\\
438 - Take it as far as the sidewalk.\\
439 - Pleasure doing business with you, sir.\\
440 - See what happens when you believe, boys?\\
441 - We are profitable!\\
442 - I'm just going to stop and get Dewey's hamster cage.\\
443 - That squirrel is chewing through the box.\\
444 - Do they really have to kill him to find out if he has rabies?\\
445 - Do you want the shots?\\
446 - Wait for me in heaven.\\
447 - Oh, my God!\\
448 - Honey, is that you?\\
449 - What is going on here?\\
450 - Good news. We did it!\\
451 - We made a profit.\\
452 - Really? How much?\\
453 - Numbers aren't important.\\
454 - A profit is a profit.\\
455 - Hey, look, a squirrel.\\
456 - What?\\
457 - There he goes!\\
458 - Squirrel. Gone.\\
459 - Craig, we will catch him.\\
460 - All right, here's the deal.\\
461 - This time, it's ten bucks each\\
462 - and one item from the medicine cabinet.\\
463 - It's gonna be tricky, fellas.\\
464 - We're on his turf now.\\
465 - Thanks for spending Christmas with my relatives.\\
466 - And next year we'll do my family.\\
467 - Marriage is all about compromise.\\
468 - You think this house is a pigsty?\\
469 - There, now it's a pigsty!\\
470 - Oh, you're real brave\\
471 - when I don't have my leg strapped on!\\
472 - They're having all the fun. We should get in there.\\
473 - Let's do it.\\
474 - You know, I feel bad for Gretchen and Otto.\\
475 - I hope I didn't make things worse.\\
476 - Thank you for taking us in.\\
477 - It is nice being with a family that gets along.\\
478 - Boy, you guys really gone out\\
479 - for this Christmas.\\
480 - It's even Christmas in the bathroom!\\
481 - As Christmases go, this one was pretty good--\\
482 - nothing on fire, no arrests,\\
483 - and, hell, we even made a profit.
\subsection {Episode 08: Block Party}
1 - Jamie needs a change. I want to do it!\\
2 - No way! We're supposed to take turns!\\
3 - Mom told us Jamie swallowed one of her diamond earrings.\\
4 - Whoever finds it when it comes out\\
5 - gets a 20-buck reward.\\
6 - Let Reese change this one.\\
7 - He hasn't gotten to in a while.\\
8 - Oh, man.\\
9 - Somehow they never noticed\\
10 - that Mom doesn't own any diamond earrings.\\
11 - Smells like my ticket to Easy Street.\\
12 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
13 -     I don't know    \\
14 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     And you're not so big    \\
23 -     Life is unfair.    \\
24 - Every year, for the last five years,\\
25 - we've spent a week in a cabin on a lake.\\
26 - This year it got ruined,\\
27 - and we had to come back three days early.\\
28 - All I'm saying is I don't ask for much.\\
29 - Once a year I want to sit on a porch, stare at a bug zapper\\
30 - and make s'mores over a trash can.\\
31 - The problem is the boys have gotten soft.\\
32 - God forbid they should have a little interaction with nature.\\
33 - Leeches! Leeches! Leeches!\\
34 - I blame video games.\\
35 - What's going on?\\
36 - Sorry, folks, street's closed.\\
37 - We live here. What is this?\\
38 - You live here and you don't know?\\
39 - It's the annual block party.\\
40 - Annual? Every year for the last five years.\\
41 - Oh, hey, Mort.\\
42 - What's going on?\\
43 - Oh, Hal.\\
44 - You're back early.\\
45 - What is all this? Why didn't we know about it?\\
46 - Well, we came out this morning,\\
47 - the sun was shining, people started talking.\\
48 - It was a spur-of- the-moment thing.\\
49 - The banner says "5th annual."\\
50 - Huh.\\
51 - You guys throw a block party\\
52 - every year when we go away?\\
53 - You know, I'm not consulted about the scheduling.\\
54 - There's a whole committee that takes care of...\\
55 - Oh, but I'm boring you.\\
56 - Polly, yeah, we got home early.\\
57 - Listen, would it be okay if we walked over\\
58 - and dropped off Jamie for a couple hours?\\
59 - There's a block party here, and we wanted to enjoy it.\\
60 - Okay, great. Thanks.\\
61 - Enjoy it?\\
62 - Doesn't anyone besides me get it?\\
63 - The whole neighborhood hates us.\\
64 - So much that they throw a giant celebration\\
65 - just because we're gone.\\
66 - Malcolm, that's not news.\\
67 - I'm just surprised they're so organized.\\
68 - It doesn't bother you that everyone despises us?\\
69 - No. These people need somebody to be mad at.\\
70 - Having us to hate gives the whole neighborhood\\
71 - something to bond over.\\
72 - Your mother's right, son.\\
73 - Communities seek out a common enemy.\\
74 - If it wasn't us,\\
75 - they'd all team up against someone else.\\
76 - Probably a minority.\\
77 - Malcolm, you can't spend your whole life worrying\\
78 - about what people think about you.\\
79 - They'll like you, they'll hate you,\\
80 - they'll think whatever they want to think, and then you die.\\
81 - Is that supposed to cheer me up?\\
82 - I don't know why you need cheering up.\\
83 - You are a teenage boy with a block party\\
84 - right outside his door.\\
85 - Now, you can stay in here and sulk if you want to,\\
86 - but your father and I are gonna go have a good time.\\
87 - Come on, honey.\\
88 - Oh, my God, it's a lawnmower parade.\\
89 - Hey, Otto.\\
90 - What's this?\\
91 - It's called a mount.\\
92 - It is an artificial cow's hindquarters.\\
93 - This will allow us\\
94 - to extract precious seed from Bruno.\\
95 - He cost me a fortune,\\
96 - but there is gold in those schlapels.\\
97 - Can't we just let him go out and mount the heifers?\\
98 - No, Bruno is much too rough for my girls.\\
99 - They have lived very sheltered lives.\\
100 - Most of them are even embarrassed by the milking.\\
101 - I'm gonna have to be the one to work this, aren't I?\\
102 - It is not as bad as you think.\\
103 - All you have to do is climb inside.\\
104 - Bruno will mount you, offer his shwarzencaufin,\\
105 - you will extract the seed.\\
106 - That's a million times worse than I thought!\\
107 - Oh, now, Francis.\\
108 - There's nothing to be afraid of.\\
109 - Hmm, I wonder why you have to wear goggles.\\
110 - Let's hear it for Ms. Michaelson's class!\\
111 - I think I speak for all of us on Maple and Jefferson\\
112 - when I say that the neighborhood gets a lot nicer\\
113 - this time of year!\\
114 - No, no, go ahead. Keep going.\\
115 - We were done anyway.\\
116 - Yeah.\\
117 - You know, I never really thought about us\\
118 - being the most hated people in the neighborhood.\\
119 - Well, Dewey, most people go through life unnoticed.\\
120 - Their names are never in the paper,\\
121 - they've got no laws named after them.\\
122 - That's fine for most people, but I wanted more.\\
123 - Hey!\\
124 - It's not always easy.\\
125 - You don't make a lot of friends being unpopular.\\
126 - Someday we'll all get even with you, Reese!\\
127 - Huh.\\
128 - What is it?\\
129 - That kid just gave me the best idea of my life.\\
130 - You know, we don't do this often enough,\\
131 - just walk around the neighborhood.\\
132 - It's nice, isn't it?\\
133 - Remind you of another fair 20 years ago?\\
134 - You spent $70 to win me a three-dollar stuffed animal.\\
135 - Well, they make those hoops too small on purpose.\\
136 - If I hadn't played till I won,\\
137 - they never would've learned their lesson.\\
138 - Besides, I wasn't trying to win the stuffed animal.\\
139 - I was trying to win you.\\
140 - Oh, Hal.\\
141 - I urge you all to stay calm\\
142 - and try to enjoy the fair anyway.\\
143 - Otherwise, they and their awful children will have won!\\
144 - Daddy, let's go!\\
145 - I'm coming, honey.\\
146 - Oh. Let me help you. Oh, you don't have to do that.\\
147 - I don't mind. I'm glad to do it.\\
148 - Well, thanks.\\
149 - That was very nice of you.\\
150 - Really?\\
151 - Is there anything else I can do for you?\\
152 - I'm just saying, kids should not be blamed\\
153 - for how terrible their parents are.\\
154 - I mean, if Saddam Hussein had a son...\\
155 - Well, maybe that's not the best example,\\
156 - but you know what I'm...\\
157 - Son, I don't care what anybody says.\\
158 - You're a very nice and thoughtful young man.\\
159 - Thanks.\\
160 - I'm really glad I met you!\\
161 - Hey!\\
162 - What are you doing?\\
163 - Huh? Who was that man?\\
164 - What do you mean?\\
165 - Oh, my God! We've been robbed!\\
166 - And you just stood there while he robbed us?\\
167 - I was walking past.\\
168 - He needed help.\\
169 - You helped him?\\
170 - He was sweating.\\
171 - And you just believed him\\
172 - when he said that this was his house?\\
173 - No! He didn't say that...\\
174 - exactly. I mean, it was implied.\\
175 - I have a lot on my mind.\\
176 - Oh, you are from that family\\
177 - in that house, aren't you?\\
178 - Yes, but I'm not like them!\\
179 - Do you even realize what you've done?\\
180 - What were you thinking?\\
181 - I just wanted somebody to like me.\\
182 - Thank you, Jim.\\
183 - Now, coming up in just a few minutes\\
184 - we have our fifth annual kielbasa eating contest,\\
185 - sponsored by Stavis Brothers,\\
186 - the kielbasa that makes you go "Mmm!"\\
187 - A kielbasa eating contest?\\
188 - I remember a certain pigtailed girl\\
189 - who could pack away a dozen king-sized.\\
190 - That was a long time ago, Hal.\\
191 - Oh, come on, Lois.\\
192 - A woman reaches her gastronomic peak\\
193 - at about just your age.\\
194 - I'll sign up with you.\\
195 - Unless... you're afraid I'll beat you.\\
196 - Hal, you're good at a lot of things,\\
197 - but this is kielbasa.\\
198 - Let's go.\\
199 - It's either a lizard or a baby alligator.\\
200 - It's been in our cesspool for a month.\\
201 - I think he lives on poo.\\
202 - Where is it?\\
203 - Hello, everyone.\\
204 - Don't worry, if I wanted to beat you up,\\
205 - you'd all be hanging by your underpants by now.\\
206 - I've gathered you here to make you an offer.\\
207 - What kind of offer, Reese?\\
208 - I'm glad you asked, Dewey.\\
209 - It's no secret that I've tortured\\
210 - all of you over the years.\\
211 - Some of you have scars\\
212 - on the outside.\\
213 - Some of you are damaged\\
214 - in places we can't see.\\
215 - Each one of you wants revenge.\\
216 - And you know what?\\
217 - You're entitled to it.\\
218 - Gee, Reese, revenge sounds great.\\
219 - But how could we accomplish that?\\
220 - Another good question, Dewey.\\
221 - For 20 bucks,\\
222 - I'll let each one of you\\
223 - beat the hell out of me for 30 seconds.\\
224 - Boy, Reese, this is tempting.\\
225 - But how do we know you won't let us hit you today,\\
226 - but then get even with us tomorrow?\\
227 - That's the beauty part.\\
228 - I'll be tied up and blindfolded\\
229 - the whole time you're beating me.\\
230 - Wow.\\
231 - The line will form at the garage in one hour.\\
232 - I'm not gonna tell you how to get the money.\\
233 - Your mothers all have purses.\\
234 - Except for you, Freddy.\\
235 - Your mother wears a travel belt.\\
236 - Ah.\\
237 - Is everything good to go?\\
238 - I think so.\\
239 - How do you plan to work her?\\
240 - What do you mean, "work her"?\\
241 - Well, you know,\\
242 - you will sit there,\\
243 - waiting for Bruno to become fersploten\\
244 - and enter the artificial hoonincootz.\\
245 - And then maybe you rock the hips a little bit.\\
246 - Maybe you tease him with the tail.\\
247 - Gosh.\\
248 - I hope this is sturdy enough\\
249 - to take his weight.\\
250 - You know, he weighs 4,000 pounds.\\
251 - And when his passion is aroused,\\
252 - he may come down\\
253 - with crushing force!\\
254 - I want a raise.\\
255 - Yeah.\\
256 - All right.\\
257 - Would you try and calm down, please?\\
258 - It's not just the neighborhood.\\
259 - It's the whole world.\\
260 - And the way people\\
261 - treat each other.\\
262 - I mean, why does it have to be like this?\\
263 - There's just so much hate.\\
264 - What about pulling Reese's hair?\\
265 - No, his head will be covered.\\
266 - Look, you're thinking too hard.\\
267 - Just let your hatred tell your body what to do.\\
268 - How are we doing?\\
269 - So far 23 kids have signed up.\\
270 - We've taken in $460!\\
271 - Oh, my God!\\
272 - Just remember, we've gotta save 20 bucks\\
273 - for the cab ride to the hospital.\\
274 - I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me for money.\\
275 - This is the greatest nation on Earth.\\
276 - It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood\\
277 - as we begin our fifth annual\\
278 - Stavis Brothers kielbasa eating contest.\\
279 - I try to line them up like one continuous dog.\\
280 - It's the space between kielbasas that tells your body it's full.\\
281 - With us this year\\
282 - we have our old friends, Louie...\\
283 - Gerry...\\
284 - Jackson...\\
285 - Lois and Hal...\\
286 - ...and last year's champion,\\
287 - Big Tony.\\
288 - And eaters-- take your marks.\\
289 - Are you going to be okay?\\
290 - He's going to be fine now.\\
291 - Hey!\\
292 - I'm in a hurry.\\
293 - I'm getting a beating in 15 minutes.\\
294 - What do you want for all of this?\\
295 - What?\\
296 - I'll take every piece of candy\\
297 - that you've got.\\
298 - Get out of the way!\\
299 - Let me get you a bag for that.\\
300 - I don't need a bag.\\
301 - But I would like\\
302 - to hear you sing.\\
303 - Well, ladies and gentlemen,\\
304 - we've lost Gerry and Jackson.\\
305 - Louie's put away six.\\
306 - But he has a long way to go\\
307 - to catch up with Hal and Big Tony,\\
308 - who've eaten nine apiece.\\
309 - Oh, just a minute.\\
310 - Lois has eaten nine, too.\\
311 - You're magnificent.\\
312 - And we just lost Louie.\\
313 - Looks like it's down to three.\\
314 - Unbelievable. What is it?\\
315 - Hal and Lois are matching Big Tony dog for dog.\\
316 - Oh, wait a minute.\\
317 - Is this the end of the road for Lois?\\
318 - Hmm? No, I just want more sauerkraut.\\
319 - Listen, kid, could you please just go home?\\
320 - Is there a problem here?\\
321 - It's all right, officer. We can handle it.\\
322 - There was a robbery, and I helped.\\
323 - We're not pressing charges.\\
324 - We'd just like to forget about the whole thing.\\
325 - You still have to come down to the station\\
326 - and fill out some forms.\\
327 - You know, looking through the house,\\
328 - I don't think he got much.\\
329 - Just a bunch of junk from the garage.\\
330 - Yeah. It's pretty hard even to say what was taken.\\
331 - I can tell you.\\
332 - I have a photographic memory.\\
333 - I can picture everything I put in the car.\\
334 - How would it be if we just phoned you later?\\
335 - There were nine boxes-- 14 by 12 by 21.\\
336 - A computer\\
337 - and two high-definition color printers.\\
338 - A signature machine, an embossing machine,\\
339 - two bottles\\
340 - of solvent-based ink eradicator.\\
341 - Three reams of linen-textured\\
342 - cotton paper with fluorescent security fibers,\\
343 - which you could use to counterfeit money,\\
344 - but for that you wouldn't need an embossing machine,\\
345 - unless you were going to forge stock certificates.\\
346 - Oh, my God, you're criminals!\\
347 - And you know what the saddest part is?\\
348 - I used to care what you thought about me.\\
349 - Actually,\\
350 - I still do care a little.\\
351 - Go! Go! Go! Go!\\
352 - Ladies and gentlemen, this is astonishing.\\
353 - Last year's record is shattered.\\
354 - I can feel it.\\
355 - I know there's a two-and- a-half-inch empty pocket\\
356 - next to my right kidney. Whoo.\\
357 - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\\
358 - Oh, my God, Big Tony's down for the count!\\
359 - Well, it's down\\
360 - to Hal and Lois now!\\
361 - You are going down, honey.\\
362 - We'll see, dear.\\
363 - All right, you all know the rules.\\
364 - You each get 30 seconds.\\
365 - Absolutely no weapons of any kind.\\
366 - All right, let me go see if he's ready.\\
367 - Reese, it's time to start.\\
368 - Here's our first secret, anonymous customer.\\
369 - It's Bobby Marcovitch.\\
370 - Not so hard!\\
371 - Don't hurt my brother!\\
372 - Okay, you, your time is up.\\
373 - Hey!\\
374 - Reese, what are you doing up there?\\
375 - Who's this?\\
376 - Some kid I found on the street.\\
377 - I don't know his name.\\
378 - Chad. Chad.\\
379 - Sorry, man.\\
380 - How could you hit me like that?\\
381 - You're my brother.\\
382 - And my partner.\\
383 - And you didn't pay!\\
384 - Let's get him!\\
385 - No, wait, wait!\\
386 - You guys are cheating!\\
387 - Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
388 -     Chances are    \\
389 -     'Cause I wear a silly grin    \\
390 -     The moment you come into view    \\
391 -     Chances are you'll think that I'm in love with you    \\
392 -     In the magical...    \\
393 - It's been two hours.\\
394 - This isn't happening.\\
395 - Send him out to graze.\\
396 - Hey, look at this.\\
397 - It says we're supposed to smear on cow pheromones.\\
398 - They're supposed to make him crazy.\\
399 - No wonder he isn't into it.\\
400 - Did you see a bottle of pheromones?\\
401 -     The chances are your chances are    \\
402 -     Awfully good    \\
403 - It's been quite a day\\
404 - in competitive sausage eating.\\
405 - I think both Hal and Lois\\
406 - are approaching the 21 mark.\\
407 - It's an amazing spectacle.\\
408 - Two great competitors\\
409 - pushing each other to greater and greater heights.\\
410 - What's going on?\\
411 - Oh, my God!\\
412 - They're cheering for my family.\\
413 - I mean, it's for a totally lame and ridiculous reason,\\
414 - but they're cheering.\\
415 - This is unprecedented.\\
416 - There's only one\\
417 - kielbasa left, and it's on Hal's plate.\\
418 - The title is his if he can finish it.\\
419 - Hal! Hal! Hal! Hal!\\
420 - Lois! Lois! Lois! Lois!\\
421 - You know,\\
422 - you think you've imagined every possible ending...\\
423 - How could we have been so wrong about them?\\
424 - They're good, good people.\\
425 - Do you feel strange not hating Hal and Lois anymore?\\
426 - My God, I love living here.\\
427 - It's a great neighborhood. Yeah.\\
428 - I'm sorry I wasn't able to help with that noise\\
429 - Friday night.\\
430 - Did that music ever stop?\\
431 - Wait. You're the one\\
432 - who called the police on my party?\\
433 - You had a party and you didn't invite me?\\
434 - Oh, don't do that.\\
435 - Why are you such a big baby?\\
436 - Don't you call him a baby.\\
437 - At least I don't have to ask him\\
438 - to mow his lawn every two weeks.\\
439 - Well, from what I hear,\\
440 - he's been mowing your lawn, if you get what...\\
441 - Don't you talk to her like that!\\
442 - Hey, hey, hey... The hell with you!\\
443 - The hell with  you!\\
444 - Honey, there's no line\\
445 - for the giant slide.\\
446 - Oh, that's okay, dear.\\
447 - I'm just going to lie down here on the pavement.\\
448 - Okay.\\
449 - Well, I guess Mom was right.\\
450 - We were serving a purpose\\
451 - in the neighborhood all these years.\\
452 - Hey, Reese, want to help me\\
453 - fill up the moon bounce with this?\\
454 - Nah. I'm going to go put dogs on the Ferris wheel.
\subsection {Episode 09: Dirty Magazine}
1 - Hey, Dad.\\
2 - How's it going, Mom?\\
3 - Howdy.\\
4 - Three days and counting.\\
5 - Too bad he doesn't have someone\\
6 - covering the hole on the other side.\\
7 -     Life is unfair.    \\
8 - This is  The Crystal Ship.\\
9 - It's our high school literary magazine.\\
10 - Nobody reads it because it's written\\
11 - by high school kids trying to be deep.\\
12 - And the editor is just some guy\\
13 - who wants to pad his college application.\\
14 - This month, it's me.\\
15 - Did you get...\\
16 - "The Mysterious... Forest"?\\
17 - Yes, Stevie. I got your drawing.\\
18 - Is it... in?\\
19 - Yes. I told you.\\
20 - Nothing gets rejected.\\
21 - It doesn't matter how self-indulgent\\
22 - or boring or childish or stupid or painful it is.\\
23 - If it can be stapled, it's in.\\
24 - And why do you care?\\
25 - Our advisor doesn't even care.\\
26 - I have to go.\\
27 - Um, I need to help\\
28 - Principal Block with... something.\\
29 - Ronnie and I have\\
30 - written stories that we want to submit.\\
31 - We demand that you embrace\\
32 - our vibrant female voices.\\
33 - So you better print them, okay?\\
34 - Okay. You got it.\\
35 - You are going to read them first, aren't you?\\
36 - Yeah, okay.\\
37 - Oh, my God.\\
38 - It's been so long,\\
39 - I didn't think it was possible.\\
40 - This story is, uh...\\
41 - is...\\
42 - What's the word?\\
43 - Good?\\
44 - Yes! Ronnie, your story\\
45 - is fantastic!\\
46 - I love the ending!\\
47 - What about mine?\\
48 - "The Frog Who Was Too Good for the World"?\\
49 - It's crap.\\
50 - Well, maybe it was over your head.\\
51 - The frog is you, the snake is your dad,\\
52 - and the moon is the dope you like on the football team.\\
53 - Lewis is not a dope.\\
54 - "Car Crash"?\\
55 - Yeah. There's this really pretty girl who,\\
56 - whenever she walks down the street,\\
57 - guys yell filthy stuff at her,\\
58 - so she trains herself to ignore them.\\
59 - The "pretty" part's not important.\\
60 - So, one day, after she's trained herself,\\
61 - she's crossing the street,\\
62 - and this construction worker yells out, "Hey, lady!"\\
63 - She doesn't turn around,\\
64 - but he's really trying to\\
65 - warn her there's a car coming.\\
66 - She ignores him, and she gets\\
67 - splattered all over the pavement!\\
68 - Men...\\
69 - are pigs.\\
70 - Did you hear?\\
71 - The plant-watering lady\\
72 - is going to testify before the S.E.C.\\
73 - My God! They're going after everybody.\\
74 - And the new supervisor starts today.\\
75 - She's only here to make cuts and fire people.\\
76 - Lots of people.\\
77 - Oh, my God! Here she comes!\\
78 - Oh!\\
79 - Come on! Come on!\\
80 - Come on!\\
81 - Come on!\\
82 - Hal, right?\\
83 - Yes!\\
84 - Nell. We took an extra trip\\
85 - around the revolving doors together this morning.\\
86 - Well, yeah... Looks like you're\\
87 - the only one here who doesn't run away from me.\\
88 - Well, you can't run forever, eh?\\
89 - Look, I know this whole situation is awkward,\\
90 - but I'm going to do my best\\
91 - to make everyone here feel respected.\\
92 - Thank you, Nell.\\
93 - Especially the ones with great-looking hands.\\
94 - She was touching me exactly like this!\\
95 - She was practically drooling over my sexy hands.\\
96 - And then, later this morning,\\
97 - she asked me if I thought her butt was big.\\
98 - And it wasn't. It was perfect!\\
99 - It wasn't an innocent request for information, Lois.\\
100 - If your butt was as perfect as hers,\\
101 - believe me, you'd know it!\\
102 - What am I going to do?\\
103 - Well, were you mean to her?\\
104 - No. Why?\\
105 - You don't want to antagonize her.\\
106 - She's the new boss.\\
107 - She decides who comes and who goes.\\
108 - What are you saying?\\
109 - I am saying that it wouldn't hurt\\
110 - for you to be... nice.\\
111 - That's all. Hal, I'm not asking you to do anything.\\
112 - It's just if she flirts with you again,\\
113 - just don't burst her bubble.\\
114 - Lois!\\
115 - Oh, all right!\\
116 - You can make me flirt with this beautiful woman,\\
117 - but you can't make me like it.\\
118 - I can make you do anything I want.\\
119 - You're right.\\
120 - Go!\\
121 - Ow!\\
122 - You know why I beat you?\\
123 - 'Cause you outweigh me by, like, 50 pounds?\\
124 - No. Because my mind is stronger than yours.\\
125 - What?\\
126 - All your Matrix guys\\
127 - and your Yodas\\
128 - and your Karate Kids do what they do\\
129 - with their minds, not their bodies.\\
130 - I beat you in here before I ever beat you there.\\
131 - You're just messing with me again.\\
132 - I don't believe you.\\
133 - You're not sure if you do or you don't.\\
134 - This is soil.\\
135 - Soil is alive.\\
136 - It is sensitive to the rhythm of who you truly are.\\
137 - This is a seed.\\
138 - Within it lies sleeping the soul of a plant.\\
139 - Together, they make a test.\\
140 - That was taught to Shaolin ninjas millions of years ago.\\
141 - If you can keep your hand like this\\
142 - until the seed sprouts, then you will have developed\\
143 - the source of all power.\\
144 - If this is real,\\
145 - then why are you teaching it to me?\\
146 - 'Cause I'm a jerk, and I know you'll fail.\\
147 - Or maybe...\\
148 - just once...\\
149 - I'm letting you in on the secret of life itself.\\
150 - What's he doing out there?\\
151 - I put a rock in his hand.\\
152 - He's trying to make it grow.\\
153 - Oh, here you are, Francis.\\
154 - What's this?\\
155 - An invitation for you and Piama.\\
156 - Otto and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary!\\
157 - You're kidding. That's great.\\
158 - Oh, I wish\\
159 - I could chop you up\\
160 - in a million pieces\\
161 - so that I could share you with the rest of the world.\\
162 - Oh, you are so romantic,\\
163 - my big Bavarian monkey face.\\
164 - Francis, I am in so much trouble.\\
165 - What's wrong? I just found out\\
166 - what Gretchen is getting me for our anniversary.\\
167 - She knows how much I love cuckoo clocks,\\
168 - so she called a factory in Innsbrook\\
169 - and somehow convinced them to handcraft a cuckoo clock\\
170 - with a little Otto and a little Gretchen\\
171 - that come out and kiss every hour.\\
172 - Wow. What'd you get her?\\
173 - Some Dustbuster filters\\
174 - and a bracelet I saw on QVC.\\
175 - Whoa. Well... you have a week.\\
176 - Is there anything you know she likes?\\
177 - Well, she always wished that I could learn to waltz.\\
178 - Really? That's great! I know how to waltz.\\
179 - I learned in military school taking girls to cotillions.\\
180 - I can totally teach you.\\
181 - Oh, no, no, no, Francis, I am a terrible dancer.\\
182 - I tried it at our wedding; I stepped on her foot.\\
183 - You can't let a little thing... I broke it in three places.\\
184 - But... Then I ripped her dress,\\
185 - and her rear end hung out for 200 people to see.\\
186 - Then I got into a fistfight with her father.\\
187 - We spent the night in jail,\\
188 - and, you know, he always was a little delicate-looking, and...\\
189 - Otto, Otto!\\
190 - I am sure I can teach you to waltz.\\
191 - I don't know...\\
192 - Oh, goodie! Look!\\
193 - It's the bracelet I ordered from QVC.\\
194 - Do you like it?\\
195 - Yeah, oh, yeah.\\
196 - I'll meet you in the barn at 10:00.\\
197 - What the hell is this?\\
198 - It's "Car Crash."\\
199 - It's a story for the literary magazine.\\
200 - It's pornography.\\
201 - How is it pornography?\\
202 - "The construction worker yelled out\\
203 - my."\\
204 - "my."\\
205 - It's supposed to be offensive.\\
206 - That's the whole point of the story.\\
207 - It's a literary device.\\
208 - There's nothing literary\\
209 - about " my"!\\
210 - Parents don't want their children\\
211 - reading " my."\\
212 - This school district has a zero tolerance policy\\
213 - on " my"!\\
214 - Our forefathers did not lay down their lives\\
215 - on San Juan Hill for "my"!\\
216 - Now, you either kill this story\\
217 - or replace all the dirty words with asterisks.\\
218 - That's just stupid.\\
219 - What's the point of bleeping out words?\\
220 - Everyone knows what they are anyway.\\
221 - Besides, Miss Shaw already said it was okay.\\
222 - Sometimes, Miss Shaw doesn't know\\
223 - when to keep her mouth shut.\\
224 - Just do it!\\
225 - This is censorship!\\
226 - Call...\\
227 - the ACLU...\\
228 - and sue... their ass.\\
229 - Yes!\\
230 - We can testify in poetry!\\
231 - I'm not going to call the ACLU for Crystal Ship.\\
232 - Just because it's under attack doesn't mean it's not lame.\\
233 - What's wrong?\\
234 - Nothing. It's okay.\\
235 - It is stupid.\\
236 - You don't have to get...\\
237 - Look... you have people\\
238 - thinking you're smart and creative all the time.\\
239 - I just got excited that people would think that\\
240 - about me for a change.\\
241 - Like I said, it's stupid.\\
242 - That is an outrage!\\
243 - Where is this high school, Iran? It's okay.\\
244 - I don't want to do anything; I just wanted some information.\\
245 - You want information?\\
246 - The Constitution exists.\\
247 - Your teachers might as well take a leak on the American flag...\\
248 - which actually is a case I defended,\\
249 - but that's not the point.\\
250 - If these fascists need a lawsuit to wake them up,\\
251 - then... Malcolm, what's the name of your school?\\
252 - My school? It doesn't have a name...\\
253 - and I'm not really a student there.\\
254 - I was just prank calling you.\\
255 - Ha, ha. Fooled you.\\
256 - That guy was nuts-- I didn't want anything to do with him.\\
257 - I hung up before he could figure out where I was calling from.\\
258 - Unless... he has...\\
259 - Caller I.D.\\
260 - Attention, students.\\
261 - Attention, students.\\
262 - As you know, we publish a literary magazine\\
263 - called  The Crystal Ship.\\
264 - Well, we do.\\
265 - This morning, I received word that the ACLU\\
266 - has filed a lawsuit to force us to publish\\
267 - an extraordinarily obscene essay.\\
268 - The school district's lawyers have given us a choice.\\
269 - We can either turn our high school\\
270 - into an adult bookstore, or\\
271 - we can cancel all extracurricular activities.\\
272 - Therefore, the football team is hereby canceled.\\
273 - The debate team is hereby canceled.\\
274 - The drama club, canceled.\\
275 - The glee club, canceled.\\
276 - The prom, canceled.\\
277 - No!\\
278 - If any of you wish to find the student editor, Malcolm,\\
279 - and thank him for this, you'll find\\
280 - his class schedule posted outside my office.\\
281 - You are terrible!\\
282 - You have completely wasted four entire days of waltz lessons.\\
283 - It makes me sick\\
284 - to look at you.\\
285 - Otto, this isn't helping.\\
286 - Every time you punch yourself,\\
287 - we lose hours of valuable practice time.\\
288 - You just... you got to relax.\\
289 - How can I relax when Gretchen is depending on me?\\
290 - You do not learn by relaxing.\\
291 - You learn by violently\\
292 - assaulting your problem\\
293 - until it surrenders its mysteries to you!\\
294 - I just feel like you're psyching yourself out.\\
295 - Why don't you take five and clear your head?\\
296 - You take five.\\
297 - I shall study\\
298 - the videotape of our previous lessons.\\
299 - I will correct the problems in my technique.\\
300 - Mm-hmm, perhaps more weight on my left instep.\\
301 - Otto, stop! Just stop all of this.\\
302 - This isn't work!\\
303 - This isn't science!\\
304 - This is dancing!\\
305 - Stop thinking.\\
306 - Stop watching tapes.\\
307 - And take off the waltz-trainer!\\
308 -        \\
309 - Feel the music.\\
310 - Look into my eyes.\\
311 - But I... Shh!\\
312 - But Gretchen...\\
313 - Shh.\\
314 - Forget Gretchen.\\
315 - Forget the past and its failures,\\
316 - the future\\
317 - and its hopes.\\
318 - The world is gone.\\
319 - Right now all that exists is you...\\
320 - ...and me\\
321 - and the waltz.\\
322 - Hey, Hal.\\
323 - Tough day. My neck is so stiff.\\
324 - Mmm!\\
325 - So... what's a guy like you do for fun, huh?\\
326 - I didn't know what to say.\\
327 - I don't do anything for fun.\\
328 - Don't tell me you just stood there for ten minutes\\
329 - with your mouth hanging open?\\
330 - She wasn't even listening, Lois.\\
331 - She was too busy mentally stripping me\\
332 - and dressing me in leather.\\
333 - Boys, get out here. Dinner.\\
334 - How long is this going to take?\\
335 - I had to have Billy Hawkins\\
336 - help dress me for gym.\\
337 - It'll grow when you stop needing it to grow.\\
338 - Malcolm, where've you been?\\
339 - Captain of the football team wanted to show me\\
340 - how he decorated the inside of his locker.\\
341 - Yes, well, the principal of your school called.\\
342 - He said you filed a lawsuit so you could destroy the school.\\
343 - That's a total lie.\\
344 - All I'm trying to do is publish a magazine full of dirty words.\\
345 - Oh, and that's supposed to make me feel better?\\
346 - I didn't even start this.\\
347 - But everybody's fighting me so hard,\\
348 - it makes me think I can't just back down.\\
349 - You always said\\
350 - there are principles you can't ever give up,\\
351 - no matter what people do to you.\\
352 - And I'm as surprised as anyone,\\
353 - but I think that's what I'm doing.\\
354 - What's her name?\\
355 - Who?\\
356 - The girl you're trying to impress.\\
357 - Hope she's cute.\\
358 - This isn't about a girl.\\
359 - A girl wrote the dirty story.\\
360 - Oh, son, you want to be careful.\\
361 - A girl who writes dirty stories\\
362 - sounds a little advanced for you.\\
363 - That's not what this is about.\\
364 - Ronnie's a lesbian.\\
365 - Well, maybe she wouldn't be a lesbian\\
366 - if you tucked in your shirt once in awhile.\\
367 - I'm just trying\\
368 - to help her.\\
369 - She doesn't deserve this.\\
370 - She went to all the trouble to express something\\
371 - in a way that's actually good, and now she's being silenced\\
372 - by a bunch of stupid, arbitrary people\\
373 - for stupid, arbitrary reasons.\\
374 - And I think that's just wrong.\\
375 - Son, you don't want to come on that strong.\\
376 - That might be what turned her gay in the first place.\\
377 - Come in.\\
378 - You wanted to see me...\\
379 - What's going on?\\
380 - Malcolm, the teachers and I\\
381 - are not here to blame.\\
382 - We're looking for a solution.\\
383 - This is Mr. Mellon.\\
384 - He's legal counsel for the district.\\
385 - It's nice to meet you.\\
386 - Now if it were up to me, you'd just be expelled,\\
387 - but the district thinks that there's a way\\
388 - to get everything back the way it was.\\
389 - Good. Cause I never wanted to fight everyone.\\
390 - Of course you didn't.\\
391 - Basically, son, you sign this letter.\\
392 - It says "Car Crash" never met the standards of Crystal Ship.\\
393 - You just picked it to see what you could get away with.\\
394 - It was an adolescent prank,\\
395 - and you apologize.\\
396 - Now just sign this,\\
397 - and everyone gets their clubs back.\\
398 - I'm not going to sign it.\\
399 - This is just a lie.\\
400 - All right, Malcolm, I wasn't going to mention this,\\
401 - but I made cupcakes for you kids every week.\\
402 - Look, I'm not the only one affected by this.\\
403 - I agree.\\
404 - Ronnie?\\
405 - I'd like you to sign it, Malcolm.\\
406 - I just want field hockey back.\\
407 - Hello, there, Nell.\\
408 - Your eyes\\
409 - are very pretty. Really?\\
410 - You like my eyes?\\
411 - No!\\
412 - I was just told to say that.\\
413 - I'm sure you're very pretty,\\
414 - but I don't find you even remotely attractive.\\
415 - I'm only flirting with you because my wife is making me!\\
416 - Wait a minute.\\
417 - I was flirting with  you,\\
418 - and the first thing you did was tell your wife?\\
419 - I tell her everything.\\
420 - And she told you to flirt back with me?\\
421 - Yeah.\\
422 - Just out of curiosity,\\
423 - how far was your wife willing to take this?\\
424 - She wouldn't tell me.\\
425 - Hal, it's okay. Calm down.\\
426 - Now, the first thing\\
427 - you need to know is, I'm not going to fire you.\\
428 - You're not? No.\\
429 - I was going to,\\
430 - but then Grossman and Ball\\
431 - got indicted,\\
432 - and you're the only one left in the department.\\
433 - Oh. I'm really glad\\
434 - it worked out this way for you, Hal.\\
435 - Thank you. Thank you.\\
436 - Lois will be so relieved.\\
437 - Well... we don't want her\\
438 - to be too relieved.\\
439 - It's hardly noticeable.\\
440 - Good.\\
441 - We can finish going over your progress reports\\
442 - in my office this afternoon.\\
443 - I'm on fire.\\
444 - Ah. Malcolm.\\
445 - So, have you, uh, made a decision yet?\\
446 - Yes. I want the clubs back.\\
447 - So I signed the letter\\
448 - and sent it to your lawyer.\\
449 - I even made copies.\\
450 - Yeah, what's all this other stuff?\\
451 - I put the letter on the back cover\\
452 - of my new  independent\\
453 - literary magazine.\\
454 - We made 700 copies, and we're distributing it\\
455 - 20 feet outside the school grounds\\
456 - as required by law.\\
457 - It's called "Absolutely Filthy Smut."\\
458 - It's a catchy title. People seem interested.\\
459 - Man, from now on\\
460 - I'm going to ask a girl's permission\\
461 - beside I say, "nice rack."\\
462 - You know, I kind of wish\\
463 - I did put some smut in it, though.\\
464 - People are gonna be disappointed.\\
465 - Don't be... so sure.\\
466 - "The Mysterious... Forest."\\
467 - Fold A...\\
468 - to meet B.\\
469 - That's a picture of...!\\
470 - Thank you... Cinemax.\\
471 - Ew.\\
472 - Freedom's... a glorious... thing.\\
473 - Oh, Otto, this is such a wonderful party!\\
474 - Everything is just perfect.\\
475 - Quiet, please!\\
476 - If everyone could stop their drunken reveling\\
477 - for a second.\\
478 - Gretchen,\\
479 - my love, my life, my bride of 25 years,\\
480 - I have finally learned to do something\\
481 - that you never thought I would be able to do.\\
482 - Maestro, if you please?\\
483 -        \\
484 - May I have this waltz?\\
485 - Otto...\\
486 - Oh, uh, I'm sorry.\\
487 - Oh, oh!\\
488 - I don't understand this.\\
489 - I was doing this perfectly last night.\\
490 - It's all right, Otto.\\
491 - I worked so hard\\
492 - to try to prove my love for you.\\
493 - Oh...\\
494 - I have the same music, I have the same boots,\\
495 - I have the same...\\
496 - Aha!\\
497 - Gretchen, prepare to be dazzled!\\
498 - Aw, geez...\\
499 - Okay.\\
500 -        \\
501 - Thank you, Otto.\\
502 - What are you doing?\\
503 - Hopefully messing Dewey up for life.\\
504 - Nice.\\
505 - Oh, my God.\\
506 - He did it.\\
507 - You never even put a seed in his hand.\\
508 - It's like a miracle.\\
509 - The kid actually did it.\\
510 - This makes it so much funnier.\\
511 - You put the lipstick on yourself, right?\\
512 - Okay.\\
513 - No, I'm serious.\\
514 - You put it on.\\
515 - Sure.\\
516 - Hal, you did.\\
517 - Just say you did.\\
518 - Okay, I did.\\
519 - Hal...
\subsection {Episode 10: Hot Tub}
1 - So you can shoot free throws better than me.\\
2 - Fine. Whatever. Big deal.\\
3 - That's all you've got on me.\\
4 - Can you stop a ceiling fan with your head?\\
5 - I didn't think so.\\
6 - And look at this.\\
7 - My Popsicle's like twice the size of yours.\\
8 - What a score.\\
9 - I am totally...\\
10 - Reese.\\
11 - Oh.\\
12 - Never mind.\\
13 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
14 -     I don't know    \\
15 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\
24 -     Life is unfair.    \\
25 - Jamie, how can you enjoy this processed food?\\
26 - This is nothing like you'd eat out in the wild.\\
27 - I did it!\\
28 - I got my learner's permit.\\
29 - I can drive anywhere with an adult.\\
30 - And the adult does not\\
31 - have to be visible from the outside.\\
32 - I checked.\\
33 - Everyone taking the test was trying to copy off him.\\
34 - Wow, Mom's actually proud of me.\\
35 - It's kind of nice to finally have my moment in the...\\
36 - Dewey?!\\
37 - Oh, my God!\\
38 - Is this what it looks like?\\
39 - Yes, Mom. This is a friend.\\
40 - His name's Noah.\\
41 - Oh, Noah, it is such a pleasure to meet you.\\
42 - I can't tell you how thrilled I am...\\
43 - Mom.\\
44 - If we seem too excited, we're going to spook him.\\
45 - So as far as you're concerned, this is just another day.\\
46 - Come on, Noah.\\
47 - Dewey?\\
48 - Okay, I'm done now.\\
49 - Honey, come on out here.\\
50 - I have a surprise for you.\\
51 - What is this?\\
52 - It's a hot tub, Lois.\\
53 - Are you out of your mind?\\
54 - We can't afford a hot tub.\\
55 - That's what I said, too,\\
56 - but then the sales guy showed me how wrong I was.\\
57 - Boys, get out here!\\
58 - Hal, I can't believe you did this without me.\\
59 - You know we always make these kinds of decisions together.\\
60 - It was an in-store promotion.\\
61 - We got 20% off\\
62 - on the spot.\\
63 - Plus a tub club card, plus free caulking.\\
64 - And that's where they kill you, Lois-- the caulking.\\
65 - Hal...\\
66 - A hot tub.\\
67 - Sweet.\\
68 - This is just what it's like here.\\
69 - We're always getting great stuff like hot tubs.\\
70 - Hal, you're taking it back.\\
71 - What about the boys?\\
72 - Don't they get a say in this?\\
73 - Yeah, Mom, it'll be great\\
74 - for entertaining.\\
75 - No, they do not get a say in this\\
76 - because we are not keeping it.\\
77 - Well, we're... kind of locked in.\\
78 - We're what? Lois, you don't get\\
79 - deals like this without making a commitment.\\
80 - It's zero percent interest.\\
81 - If you factor in inflation, it's almost like\\
82 - they're paying us 2,800 bucks.\\
83 - $2,800!\\
84 - I can't believe you!\\
85 - You went behind my back,\\
86 - you spent money you had no right to spend to buy a pile\\
87 - of lumber and tubes.\\
88 - Don't worry.\\
89 - It has very detailed assembly instructions,\\
90 - which I won't go anywhere near because Malcolm's doing it.\\
91 - I don't mind.\\
92 - The baby's head was in the sun.\\
93 - Otto, what are you doing?\\
94 - I am posting the new safety rules.\\
95 - There have been far too many senseless accidents.\\
96 - People will have no excuse not to be safe.\\
97 - Francis! You wouldn't believe what happened-- I almost...\\
98 - Otto! Oh, my God!\\
99 - You okay?!\\
100 - Manfred Schmidt.\\
101 - Did I tell you?\\
102 - You just can't have a care in the world\\
103 - when you're in a hot tub.\\
104 - It's like a trip back to the old amniotic sac.\\
105 - Jamie's going to be asleep for another hour.\\
106 - Do you think I could borrow your car\\
107 - for a quick trip to the Lucky Aide?\\
108 - I'll drive!\\
109 - Oh, no, I'll be fine, really.\\
110 - You all look so comfortable,\\
111 - and it's really just...\\
112 - Not a problem at all.\\
113 - I got the keys. Let's go!\\
114 - Honey, take a load off.\\
115 - No, thanks.\\
116 - Since now you've decided\\
117 - we're a family where everyone\\
118 - does whatever they want,\\
119 - what I want is to\\
120 - not be in the hot tub.\\
121 - These jets are great.\\
122 - I couldn't hear a word she said.\\
123 - And if you really listen,\\
124 - everything has its own vibration.\\
125 - The trees and the grass...\\
126 - I mean, it's like the whole world\\
127 - is screaming sometimes.\\
128 - But you know, you can get one of those\\
129 - white noise machines and really crank it...\\
130 - Oh, stop here.\\
131 - What about the drugstore?\\
132 - I just need to grab something.\\
133 - This is cool. I get to drive.\\
134 - Plus, I got to know Polly a little bit better.\\
135 - It turns out she hasn't had a TV in 12 years,\\
136 - and instead of chemicals, her dry cleaner uses tea.\\
137 - Okay, but the driving is still cool.\\
138 - Go! Go! Go! Go! What?\\
139 - I said go!\\
140 - What did you do? Malcolm, just give me a second to explain.\\
141 - I didn't do anything wrong.\\
142 - Trust me-- we're not in any danger.\\
143 - Then take your foot off the gas!\\
144 - Okay, what did you take?\\
145 - What is that thing?\\
146 - This is mine.\\
147 - It belongs to me.\\
148 - My ex-boyfriend Danny took it and he wouldn't give it back,\\
149 - and this happens to be my mother.\\
150 - Your what?\\
151 - My mother's in here. Her ashes.\\
152 - I meant to get her a nicer urn,\\
153 - but they just raised my tuition at the Wicca School.\\
154 - So why couldn't you just ask the guy for the ashes?\\
155 - I don't think that would be\\
156 - a really good route to go with Danny.\\
157 - He's a very troubled man.\\
158 - What? Please don't tell your parents, okay?\\
159 - I need you to keep this between us, please?\\
160 - I love Jamie,\\
161 - and he loves me,\\
162 - and I'd be crushed if I couldn't see him.\\
163 - Literally.\\
164 - Emotions can compress organs, Malcolm.\\
165 - So can you help me out on this?\\
166 - Fine.\\
167 - This is weird.\\
168 - All I keep thinking is,\\
169 - it is so cool that I'm driving.\\
170 - Francis, have you seen Otto?\\
171 - What's the matter?\\
172 - I don't like letting him out of my sight.\\
173 - He's been so accident-prone.\\
174 - In the past few days, he smashed up both our cars.\\
175 - He keeps falling down the stairs.\\
176 - This morning, he set his hair on fire\\
177 - with his reading glasses.\\
178 - Gretchen, my love, I wonder if you can\\
179 - fetch the tweezers.\\
180 - I seem to have an ass-full of cactus.\\
181 - Otto, it was just beginning to heal.\\
182 - Well, I'm sorry. It's not like I'm doing this on purpose.\\
183 - Ooh...\\
184 - Francis, I'm afraid\\
185 - I'm doing this on purpose.\\
186 - What, hurting yourself?\\
187 - I don't know. It doesn't seem\\
188 - like all of these things could be accidents.\\
189 - It's like there is some\\
190 - subconscious drive to punish myself for some unknown...\\
191 - Otto, what does the name Manfred Schmidt mean to you?\\
192 - I haven't thought about him for years.\\
193 - I'm... oh, oh...\\
194 - What?\\
195 - Manfred Schmidt is Gretchen's fianc  .\\
196 - Well, he was, until I stole her.\\
197 - You stole Gretchen?\\
198 - He was my best friend,\\
199 - but I was in love with Gretchen, too.\\
200 - And on the day\\
201 - they were going to elope,\\
202 - I told Manfred that Gretchen had already gone\\
203 - and that she would meet him at the train station in Berlin.\\
204 - Oh, Otto.\\
205 - Poor Gretchen stood in the rain for hours,\\
206 - devastated.\\
207 - And then I came along\\
208 - and I comforted her, and, uh,\\
209 - one thing led to another thing, and, uh...\\
210 - well, here we are-- 25 years of perfect love...\\
211 - built on a lie.\\
212 - Otto, this is obviously tearing you up inside.\\
213 - Why don't you just call this guy and apologize\\
214 - before you really end up hurting yourself?\\
215 - Francis, I don't think I have the courage.\\
216 - Besides,\\
217 - now that I know what is behind it,\\
218 - maybe the problem will go away.\\
219 - Those are thumb tacks.\\
220 - Dad.\\
221 - Noah and I were supposed to play together,\\
222 - but when I got to his house,\\
223 - he wasn't there.\\
224 - I waited for an hour, but he never showed up.\\
225 - Don't be so negative.\\
226 - Maybe he got hurt and was taken to the hospital,\\
227 - or maybe his grandmother died.\\
228 - ...and then my guy parachutes in\\
229 - and shoots your guy.\\
230 - Oh! I'm cold!\\
231 - I'm so cold!\\
232 - Oh, come on, Jamie.\\
233 - Here comes the airplane.\\
234 - Come on, say "ah."\\
235 - Boy, you know, I think the tension\\
236 - in my neck was dulling my taste buds.\\
237 - These hamburgers are amazing, honey.\\
238 - Well, thank you.\\
239 - And even with the cheese,\\
240 - it came in for less than $2,800.\\
241 - Who has the mustard?\\
242 - I don't know. Maybe Reese stole it.\\
243 - Like he steals everything.\\
244 - Well, maybe the mustard likes me better.\\
245 - Maybe the mustard and I have more fun.\\
246 - You totally stole Noah from me!\\
247 - Whoa, you can't just change subjects on me.\\
248 - We were talking about mustard.\\
249 - I was talking about Noah.\\
250 - Oh, man, what a great kid.\\
251 - It's like having a little brother, you know?\\
252 - He was so proud of me when I\\
253 - beat the crap out of Craig Jansen for him.\\
254 - It was a nice moment.\\
255 - Malcolm, how was your drive today? Fine.\\
256 - Just went to the Lucky Aide and back, that's it, huh?\\
257 - Yeah.\\
258 - The Lucky Aide\\
259 - is only two and a half miles each way,\\
260 - yet the odometer mysteriously gained 23 miles.\\
261 - Okay, well, after I dropped Polly off,\\
262 - I took the car by myself. I'm sorry.\\
263 - I was just so excited,\\
264 - and I wanted to show off, so I drove around the mall.\\
265 - Well, thank you for being honest with me.\\
266 - Now give me the permit.\\
267 - What?! Two months without driving.\\
268 - But, Mom...\\
269 - Because you were honest with me,\\
270 - I'm not going to wad this up\\
271 - and throw it down the garbage disposal.\\
272 - That's so unfair! Dad?\\
273 - Malcolm, you know I always agree\\
274 - with your mother.\\
275 - Whether or not she holds herself to the same standard.\\
276 - That's it!\\
277 - I'm sick of all the noise around here. Everybody out!\\
278 - Hal, you're taking the boys to the movies, now!\\
279 - Everybody up. Let's go, let's go!\\
280 - Well, I didn't know the movie\\
281 - was going to be sold out.\\
282 - I'll get the paper.\\
283 - I didn't want to see the dog movie anyway.\\
284 - Well, whatever we see, I have to be back by 7:00.\\
285 - Me and Noah are ambushing Kevin Teevens.\\
286 - Another one? What are you, his enforcer?\\
287 - It's called being a friend.\\
288 - Okay, what do you boys want to see?\\
289 - I don't care. The real fun is being driven there by my dad.\\
290 - Come on.\\
291 - Hey, what about this one?\\
292 - There's a review right here.\\
293 - Sounds good.\\
294 - Let's go.\\
295 - Ah.\\
296 - Well, he's missing out on a great cardio workout.\\
297 - Malcolm, right?\\
298 - Who are you? My name is Danny.\\
299 - I believe you took something\\
300 - that belongs to me.\\
301 - What, did you think I wouldn't find you?\\
302 - Do you think you could get away with this?\\
303 - Do you think I'm stupid?\\
304 - Do you think this is fun for me?!\\
305 - I don't know what question to answer.\\
306 - Aah! Sinus headache.\\
307 - The pain makes me furious,\\
308 - and the fury makes it more painful,\\
309 - and then you just black out and you don't know what you did.\\
310 - How can I help you?\\
311 - I want the urn that Polly took.\\
312 - You want her mother's ashes?\\
313 - She told you her mother's in there?\\
314 - My father's in there.\\
315 - My father, who I loved,\\
316 - who went cold-turkey for my graduation.\\
317 - That's whose ashes are in there.\\
318 - Oh. Well... You are going to give me that urn.\\
319 - I know where you live.\\
320 - So listen up.\\
321 - I'm going to go get an allergy shot.\\
322 - And right after that,\\
323 - I'm coming over to your house for the ashes.\\
324 - Well, look at the giant surprise that happened here.\\
325 - You want to tell me\\
326 - this wasn't a huge waste of money now?\\
327 - Every tub has a break-in period.\\
328 - It's just adjusting to our natural body chemistry.\\
329 - There's a six-inch crust of algae.\\
330 - The tub is fine.\\
331 - See? Absolutely perfect.\\
332 - You lied to me.\\
333 - What do you mean?\\
334 - I just met Danny, and he says\\
335 - his father's ashes are in that urn.\\
336 - Well, yes, they are.\\
337 - So you lied.\\
338 - No, the truth is, it's my mother's ashes,\\
339 - his father's ashes, the springer spaniel\\
340 - that we bought together and a cat I had before I met him.\\
341 - What?! You know how when you move in with somebody,\\
342 - you-you mix up your plates and your CDs...\\
343 - Look, he was acting really, really scary.\\
344 - Like psycho dangerous scary.\\
345 - Just tell me, do I need to be worried?\\
346 - Oh, no. No.\\
347 - Yes.\\
348 - Oh, God. All right.\\
349 - I've got to think.\\
350 - I'll think of something.\\
351 - I couldn't think of anything.\\
352 - We're out of the city; you can turn on the headlights.\\
353 - Okay, his plane landed an hour ago.\\
354 - He should be here any minute.\\
355 - Manfred Schmidt.\\
356 - What if the fire is still there\\
357 - between him and Gretchen?\\
358 - Come on, Otto,\\
359 - you know how much Gretchen loves you.\\
360 - I can do this.\\
361 - I will go get Gretchen.\\
362 - Thank you very much.\\
363 - Uh, please...\\
364 - make sure my chef finds the kitchen.\\
365 - Mr. Schmidt, welcome.\\
366 - Did you have a nice flight?\\
367 - Ah, yes, thanks.\\
368 - When you fly your own jet,\\
369 - it always makes the time go so much faster.\\
370 - Uh, did your wife come with you?\\
371 - Oh, I never married.\\
372 - After Gretchen broke my heart, I just couldn't.\\
373 - Every day I think of what might have been,\\
374 - and now-- thanks to you-- what still could be.\\
375 - Do you think she likes giant diamonds?\\
376 - Uh... look, there's been a change in plans.\\
377 - Gretchen isn't here.\\
378 - I'm afraid she stood you up.\\
379 - What? She said she wasn't interested.\\
380 - And then she disappeared.\\
381 - Tough break.\\
382 - I don't believe you. Seriously.\\
383 - You know how flighty Gretchen can be.\\
384 - I didn't come all the way from Germany\\
385 - to be turned away by some messenger boy.\\
386 - I'm not leaving until I see Gretchen.\\
387 - Otto, why are you being so mysterious?\\
388 - What is this big terrible secret?\\
389 - Well...\\
390 - Otto paid way too much for these earrings.\\
391 - Oh, Otto.\\
392 - Okay, my mom says I can stay for dinner.\\
393 - Cool.\\
394 - Oh, Dewey.\\
395 - Noah's going to need your chair.\\
396 - He's not your friend, Reese.\\
397 - Noah just made friends with me to get to you.\\
398 - And he's just using you to beat people up for him.\\
399 - Reese, take him out.\\
400 - No, listen.\\
401 - Last week, three kids beat the crap out of him.\\
402 - He's not tough enough to get them back, but you are.\\
403 - You already paid back\\
404 - Kevin Teevens and Craig Jansen.\\
405 - All that's left is Todd Lemmon,\\
406 - and I took care of him myself.\\
407 - Here's a piece of his T-shirt.\\
408 - Here's his retainer with part of a tooth still on it.\\
409 - And here's my four-day suspension slip.\\
410 - Wow.\\
411 - You really nailed him.\\
412 - Thanks, Dewey. Go to hell, Reese.\\
413 - Wait. So it's just over?\\
414 - Is that all I was to you, a couple of fists?\\
415 - I have some guys you can beat up for me.\\
416 - It's too soon.\\
417 - Are you positive Danny won't go to our house?\\
418 - I told him specifically\\
419 - that he wouldn't find us or the ashes there.\\
420 - I just hope he checks his messages.\\
421 - Danny's not home!\\
422 - That doesn't work when he's in the car!\\
423 - Let go! Let go!\\
424 - What are you doing here?\\
425 - I'm here to get what's mine.\\
426 - You had no right to take my father from me!\\
427 - Oh, your "father"? Please.\\
428 - When he was sick, you made him live\\
429 - in a junked-out car in the backyard.\\
430 - That was a Le Sabre!\\
431 - Do you hear the way she talks to me?\\
432 - I'm just driving.\\
433 - We had an agreement.\\
434 - We said the ashes would stay right by the coffeemaker\\
435 - and we'd all be together. Forever.\\
436 - You and me and our dead ancestors and pets.\\
437 - Then one day I come home from drum circle\\
438 - and you're gone without even saying good-bye!\\
439 - Danny, you're the one\\
440 - who violated the agreement,\\
441 - because you had to dominate every moment\\
442 - of my life.\\
443 - You even had to cut my hair.\\
444 - And I don't like bangs!\\
445 - Are you insane? With your bone structure, you...\\
446 - Never mind.\\
447 - You're not taking my father.\\
448 - You can't have my mother.\\
449 - Give me the ashes.\\
450 - I will not!\\
451 - What are you do...? Aah! Malcolm!\\
452 - No!\\
453 - Oh!\\
454 - I have heard enough of this.\\
455 - I am sick of you people screaming about the ashes\\
456 - when it's clearly not about the ashes.\\
457 - It's not? I think it is.\\
458 - The problem is your relationship.\\
459 - And you're never going to get past it\\
460 - unless you start talking to each other like human beings.\\
461 - I-I guess I freaked out...\\
462 - when you left me without even saying good-bye.\\
463 - I'm sorry about that.\\
464 - We both know it had to end.\\
465 - I just couldn't face hurting you.\\
466 - You deserved better from me.\\
467 - Thank you.\\
468 - You're welcome.\\
469 - So if, uh, there's nobody else back there,\\
470 - I'm just gonna turn around and go home.\\
471 - You're a heart healer, Malcolm.\\
472 - I'm pretty sure it's too late for you now,\\
473 - but in the next life, you're gonna really cash in.\\
474 - I have to say, I've only ever seen this on boats.\\
475 - I'm gonna have to make some phone calls on this one.\\
476 - Go ahead and say it. I know you're dying to.\\
477 - Why do I always have to be the fun killer?\\
478 - What are you talking about?\\
479 - Do you know what it's like to be the person\\
480 - in charge of saying "no" all the time?\\
481 - I hate it.\\
482 - Honey, we depend on you for that.\\
483 - You're the one who keeps us from killing ourselves.\\
484 - Yes, but all I ever hear is "Why can't we?"\\
485 - and "You never let us."\\
486 - Just once can't I be the person\\
487 - who gets to have the fun, crazy idea?\\
488 - You know what? Absolutely.\\
489 - Go ahead.\\
490 - What do you have in mind?\\
491 - Well, I can't come up with something just on the spot.\\
492 - Okay. This should stunt the algae growth.\\
493 - This should burn off your outer layer of skin.\\
494 - And these pills will gradually kill\\
495 - what's lodged in your urethra.\\
496 - It was a kidnapping situation\\
497 - and it wasn't our fault...\\
498 - Where's Mom and Dad?\\
499 - They're not home yet.\\
500 - Oh, my God, this is fate.\\
501 - We said "knock, knock."\\
502 - And this is the universe saying, "Who's there?"\\
503 - If they ask, I was here all night.\\
504 - Oh, boys,\\
505 - your mom has a really crazy idea\\
506 - she wants to run by you. Probably too crazy.\\
507 - Lois?\\
508 - We are going to have ice cream on the good china.\\
509 - Wow, that's crazy. Oh, cool. Are you sure?\\
510 - I told you! Wow.
\subsection {Episode 11: Ida's Boyfriend}
1 - Who's a big leaguer, huh?\\
2 - Who is it?\\
3 - Ooh!\\
4 - Hey, what an arm!\\
5 - Oh! You got me again.\\
6 - Bam! You really nailed me.\\
7 - He looked like he was enjoying it!\\
8 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
9 -     I don't know    \\
10 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     Life is unfair.    \\
20 - Morning.\\
21 - What are you hiding?\\
22 - What are you talking about?\\
23 - Stop wasting my time.\\
24 - I can smell the guilt from here.\\
25 - You know, if you fess up now, I might go easy on you.\\
26 - You can't just pretend to know something,\\
27 - hoping I'll blurt out a confession.\\
28 - I'm not hiding anything.\\
29 - Okay, I'm hiding something.\\
30 - Cool, huh?\\
31 - If I hide it from my parents\\
32 - for a month until it heals,\\
33 - then I can take it out and put it back anytime I want.\\
34 - And do you know why I did this?\\
35 - Me neither.\\
36 - Hey, that's really neat.\\
37 - Thanks. It's the USS Constitution.\\
38 - In 1803, it sailed all the...\\
39 - Typhoon!\\
40 - I can't believe you did that!\\
41 - How about now?\\
42 - You idiotic...!\\
43 - I hate you!\\
44 - I wish you weren't my brother!\\
45 - I wish you never existed!\\
46 - Wow. How did that happen?\\
47 - What?\\
48 - It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.\\
49 - What is?\\
50 - I wished as hard as I could\\
51 - and Reese completely disappeared.\\
52 - Yeah, yeah, very funny.\\
53 - Huh. The smell is gone, too.\\
54 - I wonder if it works on other things.\\
55 - Nah. If this were gone, I'd miss it.\\
56 - You have your father's breasts.\\
57 - For God's sake, Mother,\\
58 - what are you doing here?\\
59 - A simple "hello" is asking too much?\\
60 - I'm sorry.\\
61 - You scared the living daylights out of me.\\
62 - I have news.\\
63 - Look, if Susan kicked you out,\\
64 - it doesn't mean you can stay here,\\
65 - because we just don't have the room.\\
66 - Not with the new baby and all.\\
67 - Oh, yes, another precious baby.\\
68 - You wouldn't want your welfare checks to dry up.\\
69 - I'm not moving in. I'm getting married.\\
70 - What?!\\
71 - His name is Mr. Li.\\
72 - I met him on my Alaska cruise.\\
73 - We're getting married tomorrow.\\
74 - You're getting married tomorrow?!\\
75 - At my age, if he has his teeth\\
76 - and is good in bed, why wait?\\
77 - Oh, I forgot.\\
78 - This one doesn't like girls.\\
79 - Grandma, I'm not gay.\\
80 - That's right. I'm just a liar.\\
81 - You'll be giving the rehearsal dinner here tonight.\\
82 - Tonight? Is Susan coming?\\
83 - No. Maybe next time your sister will think twice\\
84 - before she yells the answer to Wheel of Fortune.\\
85 - Give someone else a chance.\\
86 - Wedding's at 2:00 tomorrow.\\
87 - Don't be late.\\
88 - We have a 6:00 flight to Hong Kong.\\
89 - You're going to Hong Kong?\\
90 - Yes. He has a house there. That's where we're going to live.\\
91 - You're moving to China?\\
92 - I know.\\
93 - Chickens in the streets, children in the sweatshops,\\
94 - everyone smokes.\\
95 - It's a dream come true.\\
96 - It's just so sudden.\\
97 - I understand it is hard for you.\\
98 - I know how much you loved your father.\\
99 - Yes, that's probably it.\\
100 - Can you believe this?\\
101 - She'll be almost exactly\\
102 - on the other side of the Earth.\\
103 - We'll be separated from her\\
104 - by the entire molten core of a planet.\\
105 - It's like Christmas!\\
106 - Francis, I've done something wonderful for the hotel.\\
107 - I hired an acting group\\
108 - to stage a murder- mystery weekend.\\
109 - Oh, dear God.\\
110 - The best part is, the actors will be checking in\\
111 - as regular guests.\\
112 - They could be among us right now\\
113 - and we would never know it.\\
114 - Attention, please!\\
115 - A room for Sir Reginald Drake and his vengeful,\\
116 - alcoholic wife, Evelyn.\\
117 - I don't have any clean socks, Dewey.\\
118 - Why don't you ask Reese?\\
119 - Who?\\
120 - Here, Dewey, put this on the table.\\
121 - What was that?\\
122 - Reese, for God's sake, pick it up!\\
123 - Oh, great.\\
124 - Honey, don't worry.\\
125 - Everything's going to be fine.\\
126 - Just relax and let's have a nice dinner.\\
127 - Ida's quite a catch!\\
128 - Hi, I'm Lois. This is Hal.\\
129 - Welcome to our home.\\
130 - Hello. Nice to meet you both.\\
131 - Get your coat?\\
132 - Stay away from me.\\
133 - Ooh. Strong and independent.\\
134 - Yet not so independent that she won't be\\
135 - a fully participating partner in your marriage.\\
136 - Shut up. You're blithering like an idiot.\\
137 - And delightfully honest.\\
138 - How can you be so callous, Cedric?!\\
139 - I told you never to speak of that!\\
140 - Now quit these pointless hysterics and come to dinner!\\
141 - You'd best watch\\
142 - your step, Cedric.\\
143 - An old English hunting lodge can be a very dangerous place.\\
144 - Please, can't you get these morons out of here?\\
145 - I know. I'm very sorry.\\
146 - Just... try to ignore them.\\
147 - Alas, I am slain!\\
148 - Utterly slain!\\
149 - Who would have guessed\\
150 - that I would have been murdered by none other than...\\
151 - That's it. We're checking out.\\
152 - No!\\
153 - Please, wait.\\
154 - Otto, you have to stop this.\\
155 - It's ruining everyone's time.\\
156 - Francis, try to be more understanding.\\
157 - They may be a little under-rehearsed,\\
158 - but they're working with us.\\
159 - They were completely open to cutting the musical numbers.\\
160 - Our guests are leaving in droves.\\
161 - We lost 12 in the last hour alone.\\
162 - I am not a big game hunter,\\
163 - I am actually a police inspector.\\
164 - Specialty... murder.\\
165 - I must insist that no one leave the room!\\
166 - Angela, I know things didn't go so well\\
167 - the last time,\\
168 - but I'm ready to try this again.\\
169 - Yes, Warren? Yes?\\
170 - We'll start our questioning with you, sir.\\
171 - If you've nothing to hide, you've nothing to fear!\\
172 - If you struggle, it'll only make it worse for you.\\
173 - Maybe I shouldn't have given him\\
174 - all the keys to the guest rooms.\\
175 - Dinner's going okay so far.\\
176 - Mr. Li seems nice.\\
177 - But my tongue is killing me.\\
178 - No one told me that putting a metal spike through it\\
179 - would be so uncomfortable.\\
180 - So, you two lovebirds met on a cruise.\\
181 - What was that like?\\
182 - What is this, the third degree?\\
183 - People meet. Happens every day.\\
184 - It's an interesting story.\\
185 - The woman I dined with the first night\\
186 - was confined to sickbay after she fell overboard.\\
187 - We had rough seas.\\
188 - But as often happens,\\
189 - misfortune brings opportunity,\\
190 - for it was then I met the beautiful Ida.\\
191 - Sorry. Swallowed a bug.\\
192 - Come on, Dewey.\\
193 - Have a dumpling. They're your favorite.\\
194 - And the only way you can get one\\
195 - is by taking it off this plate\\
196 - that I'm holding, which proves that I exist.\\
197 - If no one's eating this, I will.\\
198 - Mom, Jamie's got your cigarettes.\\
199 - Who the hell is Jamie?\\
200 - Your grandson.\\
201 - Huh. We never named them\\
202 - till we were sure they would survive.\\
203 - I love this dark humor of hers.\\
204 - I'm telling you,\\
205 - you have nothing but fun ahead of you.\\
206 - Reese, this firecracker shrimp is fantastic.\\
207 - Yes. I didn't know you can get such hot peppers in America.\\
208 - Something wrong?\\
209 - I just realized that Grandma's really leaving!\\
210 - I need to be alone.\\
211 - You should get him a woman before it's too late.\\
212 - An ugly one.\\
213 - They're cheaper, they work harder.\\
214 - It's okay.\\
215 - I'm sure I had yellow goo coming out of my tongue\\
216 - before it got pierced.\\
217 - Drink your tea.\\
218 - You hate it when it gets cold.\\
219 - Oh, darling, you have something in your hair.\\
220 - What?\\
221 - Under your wig.\\
222 - What are you doing?! Get out of there!\\
223 - What is this?\\
224 - A list of my bank accounts...\\
225 - and the amounts in them.\\
226 - I had to know what I was getting into.\\
227 - Wise as well as beautiful.\\
228 - If we are going to get married,\\
229 - it is only fair you know how much money I have.\\
230 - If you're done tearing at me like a hyena,\\
231 - I have to go fix myself.\\
232 - Thank you so very much\\
233 - for allowing me into your home.\\
234 - Put on your makeup somewhere else, Nancy!\\
235 - So, I am just so incredibly curious.\\
236 - You're in love with... my mom?\\
237 - I know it seems strange to people.\\
238 - I know that we are so very different.\\
239 - But ever since I met your mother,\\
240 - I've...\\
241 - She just makes me happy.\\
242 - I'm the happiest\\
243 - I've ever been in my whole life.\\
244 - And "happy" in your culture means the same as...?\\
245 - It's open.\\
246 - Ah, gentlemen.\\
247 - I was expecting my fellow thespians.\\
248 - We're going to add a few delicious wrinkles\\
249 - to the plot tomorrow.\\
250 - Actually, that is what we wanted to talk to you about.\\
251 - Uh-uh-uh.\\
252 - If you think I'm going to give away the ending,\\
253 - you're sadly mistaken.\\
254 - Although...\\
255 - I might pay particular attention\\
256 - to the enigmatic Mrs. Pomfreet.\\
257 - Otto... I'm sorry. We have to cancel the show.\\
258 - Or Lord McGregor,\\
259 - the gruff, but...\\
260 - What?\\
261 - You've all done a wonderful job,\\
262 - but we had a scheduling mix-up and you'll have to go.\\
263 - Thank you for the wonderful work you've done.\\
264 - Oh, God, please don't fire us!\\
265 - If we lose this job, it's over.\\
266 - There's no place lower in show business we can go.\\
267 - If you think I'm bad at this,\\
268 - you should have seen me at the Dairy Queen.\\
269 - This is our last chance.\\
270 - Please don't do this.\\
271 - Please.\\
272 - Please? Please?!\\
273 - Please?\\
274 - Please?\\
275 - Please?\\
276 - I can't believe you didn't fire them.\\
277 - I remember him from Dairy Queen.\\
278 - He  was  bad.\\
279 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
280 - Malcolm, quit messing around in there\\
281 - and get out here.\\
282 - We're leaving for the wedding.\\
283 - I'll be out in a minute.\\
284 - Hold your horses.\\
285 - What?\\
286 - Nothing.\\
287 - Horses...\\
288 - Oh, my God, it's swollen so much, I can't say my S's.\\
289 - Mom's going to kill me.\\
290 - Wait. I can hide it.\\
291 - I'll be careful... how I talk.\\
292 - And avoid... that letter completely.\\
293 - Simple.\\
294 - Well, looks like all of Ida's friends showed up.\\
295 - Let's hope this thing starts soon.\\
296 - Hey, Malcolm, what time does the parking lot close?\\
297 - 6:00, 6:30, 7:00?\\
298 - Military time, that would be 1900, Dad.\\
299 - Ah, here's the blushing bride!\\
300 - I'm sorry, the hotel doesn't allow smoking in here.\\
301 - Back off, you cow.\\
302 - This is my special day.\\
303 - Hal, do you think...?\\
304 - Lois, I know it's weird, but love is blind\\
305 - and it's none of our business, so we might as well\\
306 - just let it go, wish them well, and move on.\\
307 - I know I have.\\
308 - Okay, I admit I've been a crummy brother,\\
309 - and I shouldn't have smashed your ship,\\
310 - and I probably should have tried out that new choke hold\\
311 - on an animal before using it on you.\\
312 - So, anyway, I got you this.\\
313 - Oh, wow!\\
314 - That's so cool.\\
315 - And you can play against the robots\\
316 - or you join them and fight the mutants.\\
317 - I've always wanted this game.\\
318 - I can't believe it.\\
319 - And there's a trick to skip levels. Here, let me show you...\\
320 - Mom, I just found the exact game I wanted for my birthday\\
321 - just lying on this chair.\\
322 - How can he be so insensitive?\\
323 - Jamie?\\
324 - Ah, my love.\\
325 - I almost forgot--\\
326 - my grandmother wore this very necklace\\
327 - on her wedding day.\\
328 - It's called\\
329 - Shuang Hsi,\\
330 - the Chinese symbol for double happiness.\\
331 - White people aren't impressed with this junk.\\
332 - You're not supposed to see me before the wedding.\\
333 - Go back to your room\\
334 - before someone mistakes you for a waiter!\\
335 - Whatever my bride wants.\\
336 - I'll see you in a little while.\\
337 - Oh, my God.\\
338 - Opiate,\\
339 - opiate, mood elevator,\\
340 - large mammal tranquilizer...\\
341 - He's not in love with her at all.\\
342 - She's got him drugged!\\
343 - Skies are clear at the airport.\\
344 - No problem with their flight leaving.\\
345 - I'm checking the freeways.\\
346 - Dad, Mom,\\
347 - I have to tell you...\\
348 - a thing.\\
349 - What?\\
350 - Grandma...\\
351 - be drugging...\\
352 - the man from China.\\
353 - What?\\
354 - Grandma be drugging the man from China.\\
355 - What the hell is this?\\
356 - Powerful mood elevator.\\
357 - A lot of them.\\
358 - Bottle after bottle after bottle.\\
359 - She's drugging him?\\
360 - How is she doing that?\\
361 - The tea.\\
362 - My God, of course, the tea!\\
363 - Remember, she kept refilling his cup all night.\\
364 - That's how I'd do it.\\
365 - You're sure that this is her purse?\\
366 - Ye...\\
367 - Affirmative.\\
368 - Oh, stop screwing around.\\
369 - Yes or no?\\
370 - Yes or no?!\\
371 - Not no.\\
372 - Stealing\\
373 - an old woman's purse.\\
374 - I should have you all arrested.\\
375 - Us? We know what you're doing to that poor Mr. Li.\\
376 - My God, I thought you were an evil, conniving monster before,\\
377 - but this, Mother, this is beyond the pale!\\
378 - He's a human being,\\
379 - and you're drugging him!\\
380 - It's called seduction.\\
381 - It's no different from wearing perfume\\
382 - or padding your bra with potatoes.\\
383 - What girl doesn't look for a little edge?\\
384 - You are out of your mind!\\
385 - Either you march up\\
386 - to his room and tell him this wedding is off\\
387 - or we're calling the police!\\
388 - All right, I'm going.\\
389 - Split the take?\\
390 - Mom, go!\\
391 - ...and how could our murderer\\
392 - leave no footprints?\\
393 - Because I submit to you\\
394 - that he did not walk,\\
395 - but rather swung...\\
396 - into the room... on a rope!\\
397 - And the only former circus acrobat here is...\\
398 - That man!\\
399 - And... that woman!\\
400 - Oh, Edward, the game's up.\\
401 - Yeah, we done it.\\
402 - And we'd do it again, Guv'ner.\\
403 - Mystery solved.\\
404 - Oh, bravo!\\
405 - Oh, my God.\\
406 - Did you feel that?\\
407 - It was wonderful!\\
408 - That was the best reaction we've ever had.\\
409 - Thank you so much.\\
410 - Thank you for giving us this chance.\\
411 - No need.\\
412 - The important thing is you believed in yourself\\
413 - and you did a great job.\\
414 - What a delightful display\\
415 - of intrigue and whimsy.\\
416 - I will remember this\\
417 - for years to come.\\
418 - I cannot wait to tell my friends.\\
419 - You hired the audience?\\
420 - I hated to see him so depressed.\\
421 - Within its framework of commitment and loyalty,\\
422 - marriage enables the establishment of a home...\\
423 - They look so nice together.\\
424 - Yeah, they do.\\
425 - I just love weddings.\\
426 - ...with trust and patience, your love will grow stronger.\\
427 - Weren't we supposed to stop this?\\
428 - Hmm. I think you're right.\\
429 - I wonder why we didn't.\\
430 - Who cares?\\
431 - It's nice.\\
432 - Oh, I'm not worried about it.\\
433 - I... I'm just... happy.\\
434 - Your love and respect for each other,\\
435 - your trust and understanding of each other\\
436 - will increase your contentment...\\
437 - They're all empty.\\
438 - Every bottle.\\
439 - She drugged us all.\\
440 - That filthy, hateful monster.\\
441 - But how'd she do it?\\
442 - The buffet.\\
443 - Oh, that's right.\\
444 - It showed up right after she went to talk to Mr. Li.\\
445 - That evil genius.\\
446 - You know, she knew we couldn't pass up free food.\\
447 - This is simply the most diabolical,\\
448 - hateful thing she's ever done.\\
449 - But I sure do like her dress. Don't you?\\
450 - I agree.\\
451 - It's weird-- I used to just think thoughts.\\
452 - Now my thoughts are thinking thoughts.\\
453 - It's like, if I don't exist, who's saying if I don't exist?\\
454 - You know what I mean?\\
455 - I'll tell you who's saying it.\\
456 - Me.\\
457 - It's like I think, therefore...\\
458 - Oh, wait.\\
459 - I had it.\\
460 - Don't worry, Reese, it'll come back around.\\
461 - Yeah.\\
462 - Hey, you spoke to me.\\
463 - I exist.\\
464 - For now.\\
465 - ...buds are yet to blossom\\
466 - and with care...\\
467 - You know, I have to admit,\\
468 - part of me wishes we could just stay this happy forever.\\
469 - Can we, Malcolm? Can we?\\
470 - Not really.\\
471 - I mean, most of these drugs\\
472 - wear off after four or five hours.\\
473 - Malcolm, why are you lisping?\\
474 - I pierced my tongue.\\
475 - I've been hiding it because I knew you'd go psycho.\\
476 - I'll show you psycho.\\
477 - When we get home, I'm going to pull that thing out\\
478 - with a pair of pliers.\\
479 - Sounds fair.\\
480 - Be constant and consistent in your love.\\
481 - From this comes the knowledge\\
482 - that you can weather any storm...\\
483 - Did you drink your tea?\\
484 - What tea?\\
485 - The tea I gave you\\
486 - right before the ceremony.\\
487 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
488 - I thought that was for me.\\
489 - Did anyone ever tell you,\\
490 - you have a beautiful smile?\\
491 - I haven't been to the dentist in years.\\
492 - I should really give him a call...\\
493 - Get on with it, God boy!\\
494 - Well, someone's eager for the sacrament of married love, huh?\\
495 - I think Mr. Li's coming out of it.\\
496 - Ah, what a shame.\\
497 - The old bat used up all her happy pills on us.\\
498 - Oh, also,\\
499 - this is so very, very, very important.\\
500 - Never go to bed angry.\\
501 - I should say, never go to sleep angry.\\
502 - And you know what?\\
503 - Never eat salad angry.\\
504 - Never eat soup sad.\\
505 - Give me these.\\
506 - Here.\\
507 - Go.\\
508 - Shall we pray...? No!\\
509 - All righty then. Do you take...?\\
510 - Yes!\\
511 - And do you...?\\
512 - Yes!\\
513 - Then I now pronounce you...\\
514 - Who the hell are you?\\
515 - Oh, darling, don't be silly.\\
516 - Get the rings!\\
517 - Wait, I know you.\\
518 - You're that horrible woman at my table\\
519 - who kept spitting at the busboys.\\
520 - Oh, no, no. That was someone else.\\
521 - No, it was you!\\
522 - My little honey lamb.\\
523 - Let me go! Hoochie-coochie.\\
524 - Ow! Ooh!\\
525 - Ooh!\\
526 - You take your...\\
527 - take your hands off of me!\\
528 - You can't leave me now!\\
529 - I'm pregnant! Oh!\\
530 - Why, why?!\\
531 - Why can't I ever be happy?!\\
532 - I promised I wasn't going to do this.\\
533 - There's still dirt under the rim.\\
534 - I've been scrubbing for an hour.\\
535 - It's not coming off.\\
536 - Well, since you don't care about your tongue,\\
537 - maybe you could use that to clean the toilet.\\
538 - I found Grandma's thermos.\\
539 - Looks like there's still a half cup left\\
540 - of this terrible potion.\\
541 - You know, the lawnmower needs some work.\\
542 - I think I'll go out to the garage...\\
543 - Good. Yeah, good idea.
\subsection {Episode 12: Softball}
1 - Boys, I found the beer you hid in the garage.\\
2 - After all our talks\\
3 - about drinking, you still think it's cool?!\\
4 - Well, it's not! Now, sit down and watch!\\
5 - Look at me!\\
6 - I'm Mr. Cool.\\
7 - Mmm!\\
8 - Everybody digs my scene.\\
9 - I'm the grooviest dude\\
10 - who was ever grooved on.\\
11 - I just love you boys so much.\\
12 - Who wants a hug?\\
13 -     Turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese    \\
14 -     I really think so    \\
15 - Took him long enough to find that beer.\\
16 - Yeah, but it was so worth the wait.\\
17 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
18 -     I don't know    \\
19 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
20 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     And you're not so big    \\
24 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     And you're not so big    \\
28 -     Life is unfair.    \\
29 - Guess what?\\
30 - I got another raise.\\
31 - Mr. DeSilvio said that when I clean the gunk\\
32 - out of the rendering machine,\\
33 - I vomit less than anyone who's ever worked there.\\
34 - Oh, glad someone's career's on track.\\
35 - My company may not even exist in a month.\\
36 - Well, what does Nate have to say?\\
37 - He's usually pretty levelheaded about this stuff.\\
38 - Nate faked his death and fled the country.\\
39 - Didn't he, Jamie?\\
40 - Yes, he did.\\
41 - Dad-dad.\\
42 - Here! Do these look like the hands of a lazy man?\\
43 - Do they?! You see how hard the calluses are?\\
44 - What are you doing here?\\
45 - This morning, on the phone, you said that I was lazy.\\
46 - Well, look at my hands, and admit that you were wrong.\\
47 - Are you biting your nails again?\\
48 - Apologize!\\
49 - I am not going to apologize for something\\
50 - that I said that's true.\\
51 - This is exactly why I drove\\
52 - eight straight hours to get here.\\
53 - To prove how far you'll go\\
54 - just to avoid a simple apology.\\
55 - I can't believe how screwed-up your priorities are.\\
56 - Hello?\\
57 - Oh, hi, baby.\\
58 - Happy anniversary.\\
59 - No, I haven't left yet.\\
60 - I'm on my way out right now. Okay.\\
61 - Seeing Francis act like this is really sad.\\
62 - I mean, for him.\\
63 - For us, it's kinda funny.\\
64 - Okay, Malcolm, let's go! We got to get to work.\\
65 - And don't forget to change your shoes.\\
66 - Okay. Can I eat my cupcake in the car?\\
67 - I was going to eat it in the car,\\
68 - whether she said I could or not.\\
69 - It's pathetic to watch Francis when he's around Mom.\\
70 - It's almost like he's her puppet or something.\\
71 - Yeah, it's really awful how she manipulates him.\\
72 - Boy, I sure love this vanilla!\\
73 - Why would anyone do something like that?\\
74 - Well, there is a certain pleasure\\
75 - in secretly controlling someone a lot dumber than you.\\
76 - Hey, you know what was really cool about Francis?\\
77 - How he used to pull all those crazy stunts.\\
78 - Yeah, that stuff was pretty awesome.\\
79 - Yeah.\\
80 - Too bad there's nothing like that now.\\
81 - Except for Kopelman's junkyard.\\
82 - You mean, with all those vicious dogs?\\
83 - Remember how Francis set the record by going over the fence\\
84 - and coming back with 11 old toilet seats?\\
85 - If only someone had the guts to do that now.\\
86 - By "someone," I meant you.\\
87 - You think?\\
88 - Took me four hours to find this old spelling test.\\
89 - C plus!\\
90 - Do lazy people get C pluses?\\
91 - No!\\
92 - Man, I got to get back on the road.\\
93 - When's Mom coming home?\\
94 - Not till after 10:00.\\
95 - Well, traffic will be better, anyway.\\
96 - All I'm saying is,\\
97 - if you don't put the pinks and the yellows together\\
98 - by date, you're not going to be able to find them later.\\
99 - And I know, you want to live in the dorm\\
100 - when you go away to college,\\
101 - but you're too easily distracted.\\
102 - You don't get to criticize decisions\\
103 - I won't even make for three years.\\
104 - Okay, you're getting cranky.\\
105 - Let's take a break.\\
106 - Look, we're over halfway done.\\
107 - Aren't you glad I didn't let you go to the bathroom before?\\
108 - Hey, Malcolm, you want to sign up for the softball team?\\
109 - It's a chance to see the old Satin Hammer in action.\\
110 - And every season, I take one lucky youngster under my wing.\\
111 - I'm already under a thumb. Well, if you're on the team,\\
112 - you don't have to work the early weekend shift.\\
113 - My mom works that shift. I'm in!\\
114 - Hey, Lois. You signing up for softball?\\
115 - I don't need to sign up, Craig.\\
116 - I'm coaching the team this year.\\
117 - You are?\\
118 - Yeah, Stu was going to do it, but his wife\\
119 - got born again and ruined his Sundays.\\
120 - Hey, Malcolm, you're playing!\\
121 - I just can't get away from you, can I?\\
122 - That's the base pay?\\
123 - And there's full dental?\\
124 - Sounds good.\\
125 - Where's the interview?\\
126 - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\\
127 - Thanks.\\
128 - I owe you one.\\
129 - So, I'm going in\\
130 - three days ahead of him for the interview.\\
131 - I mean, Nick won't have any trouble finding another job.\\
132 - They guy's an ex-Navy Seal.\\
133 - Of course, ethically, you could argue it's stealing.\\
134 - But look at hip-hop!\\
135 - They sample music all the time.\\
136 - Is that stealing, or is that art?\\
137 - Hal, you have a family. Go in for the interview.\\
138 - I've got to figure out whether I'm going to bat\\
139 - my left-handed speedster at the top of the order\\
140 - or drop him lower, so he can hit\\
141 - behind the runners and stay out of the double play.\\
142 - There.\\
143 - 20 years worth of connect-the-dot puzzles,\\
144 - model airplanes and dirty haikus.\\
145 - Do lazy people do this kind of stuff?\\
146 - I don't think so!\\
147 - This proves that you owe me an apology.\\
148 - Francis, all this proves is that you have\\
149 - a problem with obsessive compulsion.\\
150 - Lies on top of lies!\\
151 - Well, your house of cards is coming down!\\
152 - Is he still here?\\
153 - I told Piama he left this morning.\\
154 - Mom, I can't do the softball team, after all.\\
155 - Now, before you come up with what you think my reasons are,\\
156 - let me tell you what my reasons are.\\
157 - I've just got so much schoolwork.\\
158 - You don't have to play.\\
159 - You're always telling me that my grades are...\\
160 - Oh, well, good.\\
161 - It's too bad, 'cause I could have really\\
162 - helped you with your grounders.\\
163 - What?\\
164 - Your grounders.\\
165 - You don't go down to your knee for the ball.\\
166 - You know, kids your age, you don't think\\
167 - you need the fundamentals, but...\\
168 - I field grounders all the time.\\
169 - There's no problem with my grounders.\\
170 - Where do you get this stuff?\\
171 - It doesn't matter, Malcolm.\\
172 - Like you said, you got too much schoolwork, anyway.\\
173 - As soon as I figure out how she got me here,\\
174 - I'm out of here.\\
175 - Never mind.\\
176 - I'm just going to ignore her and do my homework.\\
177 - What are you working on, sweetheart?\\
178 - Just finishing a paper on Wuthering Heights.\\
179 - Wuthering Heights,  huh?\\
180 - I did my senior thesis on that.\\
181 - You did not.\\
182 - I hope you're not sticking to that tired view\\
183 - that Catherine and Heathcliff are soul mates.\\
184 - You picked up on\\
185 - the subtle hostility towards romanticism, right?\\
186 - I mean, Catherine's\\
187 - just as bound to Edgar as she is to Heathcliff.\\
188 - She takes a lock of his hair to the grave, too.\\
189 - Well, duh!\\
190 - Is this where they keep the prisoners?\\
191 - What?\\
192 - My dad's in left field.\\
193 - He likes to keep an eye on me, 'cause he thinks I'm too wild.\\
194 - My name's Stephanie. I'm...\\
195 - Malcolm, infield. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!\\
196 - And you better be wearing a cup!\\
197 - I know you've heard the rumors,\\
198 - and all I can say is, I might or might not\\
199 - have been scouted by the Kyoto Crazy Phantoms.\\
200 - But don't worry.\\
201 - I play for Lucky Aide.\\
202 - Now, watch me carefully,\\
203 - 'cause I only work at one speed-- lightnin'.\\
204 - This one's for you, Malcolm.\\
205 - Try again. Here's another one.\\
206 - Is she crazy?\\
207 - How does she expect...?\\
208 - Craig, that was amazing.\\
209 - What were you expecting?\\
210 - I told you I was good.\\
211 - I don't know, Reese.\\
212 - If I were you, I'd chicken out right now.\\
213 - Dewey, why are you always fighting me on these things?\\
214 - If you're not going to support me, you might as well leave.\\
215 - Okay, so it's pretty obvious they hate shoes.\\
216 - Write that down.\\
217 - Um...\\
218 - am I... is this where...?\\
219 - We're  not  supposed to talk.\\
220 - Oh.\\
221 - Sorry.\\
222 - Uh... excuse me? I...\\
223 - We'll be with you in three seconds, sir.\\
224 - Please stand up straight.\\
225 - Three seconds?\\
226 - So, I understand you'd like to work with us?\\
227 - I-I-I did... I just... did someone...?\\
228 - This job is a wonderful opportunity\\
229 - for the right kind of person.\\
230 - Good pay, three weeks vacation. Full benefits package.\\
231 - Plus the knowledge that you're really making a difference.\\
232 - Code Two, Code Two.\\
233 - Repeat, Code Two.\\
234 - Excuse me, was this...?\\
235 - Please, if you could hold off on your questions\\
236 - until I'm finished with mine.\\
237 - Number one, do you have a photographic memory?\\
238 - I don't think so.\\
239 - Uh-huh. Are you allergic to venomous spider bites?\\
240 - How would I know that?\\
241 - Right.\\
242 - And do you have an identical twin?\\
243 - What? No.\\
244 - Okay.\\
245 - That's all I have.\\
246 - Go next door.\\
247 - They'll make a mold of your face.\\
248 - Then we can get started.\\
249 - Thank you for your interest, sir.\\
250 - Any feelings of paranoia you may experience\\
251 - over the next few days are completely normal.\\
252 - Okay, remember-- it's hips, then shoulders.\\
253 - It's just like that little dance\\
254 - you used to do in your underpants.\\
255 - What do you know.\\
256 - Looks like store 617's\\
257 - actually thinking about showing up\\
258 - for the game next week.\\
259 - Considering what happened last year,\\
260 - that's pretty brave of you.\\
261 - We lost by three runs and had a barbecue, Mel.\\
262 - And it wasn't on my watch.\\
263 - So, can I see the underwear dance?\\
264 - Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?\\
265 - Would you?\\
266 - Slow down, we haven't even kissed yet.\\
267 - Malcolm, let's go, we got to get\\
268 - to your zit doctor before 5:00.\\
269 - Mom! What?\\
270 - Your friend doesn't care about that.\\
271 - Look at her face-- she probably goes to the same doctor.\\
272 - Hello, Mother.\\
273 - Hey, Francis. I thought you left this morning.\\
274 - I did.\\
275 - I got halfway home\\
276 - when I suddenly\\
277 - remembered the time\\
278 - when I was three years old\\
279 - and you were sick-- or so you said--\\
280 - and couldn't drive me\\
281 - to Donnie Dinesco's birthday party.\\
282 - So I rode this tricycle two miles in the pouring rain\\
283 - just to get there.\\
284 - Lazy? I think not.\\
285 - Now, I am not leaving\\
286 - until you apologize.\\
287 - All you want is an apology? That's it?\\
288 - Well, you should've said so a week ago.\\
289 - But...\\
290 - I'm hereby officially sorry.\\
291 - Okay? No! Not okay!\\
292 - That is not an apology.\\
293 - That's just one of those cleverly designed apologies\\
294 - that sounds like an apology but isn't one.\\
295 - Now you have to apologize for apologizing.\\
296 - And then apologize!\\
297 - You know what your problem is?\\
298 - You know why you can't accept my apology?\\
299 - Because you just can't stand to be happy!\\
300 - What?!\\
301 - You have an addiction to trouble.\\
302 - You need to have chaos in your life-- you always have.\\
303 - I mean, look at you.\\
304 - You have a great job,\\
305 - a nice home, a wife, and you can't stand it.\\
306 - You have to come back here\\
307 - and pick a fight with your mother.\\
308 - That's not true.\\
309 - I came back here because\\
310 - you've destroyed any chance any of us\\
311 - ever had for happiness.\\
312 - Tell her, Malcolm.\\
313 - Tell her what a horrible mother she is.\\
314 - He's right-- you insinuate yourself\\
315 - into every part of our lives, just to make sure\\
316 - there's no place we're not miserable.\\
317 - Well, you're not gonna\\
318 - turn me into a drooling infant\\
319 - like you did Francis.\\
320 - Yeah! What?\\
321 - I'm quitting the softball team.\\
322 - You are doing no such thing, Malcolm.\\
323 - You had a chance to quit, but now we have a game.\\
324 - You made a commitment to a team,\\
325 - and other people are counting on you.\\
326 - You can't force me to play.\\
327 - No, but I can confiscate your paychecks.\\
328 - You're gonna take away money that's legally mine\\
329 - for a game of softball?\\
330 - I don't know. Am I?\\
331 - You are pure evil.\\
332 - How do you sleep at night?\\
333 - Hal, will you please talk to the boys?\\
334 - Not now, Lois, I have way too much on my mind.\\
335 - Like what?\\
336 - I think I'm an international spy,\\
337 - and I don't even know which side I'm on.\\
338 - I could be a super-villain and not even know it.\\
339 - You can just say you don't want to help me, Hal.\\
340 - You look very handsome in your uniform.\\
341 - I wish you would've let me take it in around the arms.\\
342 - Well, good news for you, Lois.\\
343 - Our right fielder\\
344 - was screwing around with a price gun,\\
345 - took a sticker to the eye.\\
346 - We're a player short.\\
347 - We have to forfeit.\\
348 - Yes!\\
349 - All right! Amen!\\
350 - Well, too bad.\\
351 - Course, the real losers...\\
352 - the fans.\\
353 - Not today, Tonto.\\
354 - That's just silly.\\
355 - We're all here, we're all in uniform,\\
356 - everyone wants to play.\\
357 - Malcolm, go be on Mel's team.\\
358 - What?\\
359 - Oh, yeah, big favor.\\
360 - No, no, no, no, no, his game\\
361 - has really improved. Hasn't it, honey?\\
362 - After all that stuff about my commitment to this team,\\
363 - you could just decide to give me away?\\
364 - Malcolm, everybody's nervous about making new friends.\\
365 - Just be yourself. They'll like you fine.\\
366 - I'm gonna hit this ball so far out of the park,\\
367 - my mom's gonna wish she never...\\
368 - Wait, what do I do with my hips again?\\
369 - Strike one! What?\\
370 - Okay, it'll be okay.\\
371 - Just stop thinking.\\
372 - You can do it, honey.\\
373 - Strike two!\\
374 - Look, just don't talk to me, okay?!\\
375 - Just pitch the ball!\\
376 - I can't believe she's doing this.\\
377 - I just hate it when she treats me like this\\
378 - in front of everyone. It's so...\\
379 - Strike three!\\
380 - Hello?\\
381 - No, honey bun, I'm still here.\\
382 - I have a few more things to straighten out\\
383 - before I can leave, but I promise\\
384 - that we will celebrate our anniversary\\
385 - as soon as I get home.\\
386 - Right, if you're still there.\\
387 - Did Reese and Dewey leave yet?\\
388 - Leave for where? Kopelman's junkyard.\\
389 - Reese is going to break the toilet seat record.\\
390 - He's what?!\\
391 - I still have one\\
392 - you autographed for my brother.\\
393 - It'll probably drop in value after this.\\
394 - Just tell them you don't want the job.\\
395 - Don't think about what they can do to you.\\
396 - Just... tell them!\\
397 - Uh, thank you for considering me.\\
398 - It's very flattering.\\
399 - But I've decided to stay where I am for now.\\
400 - If things change, I'll let you know.\\
401 - Where is he?\\
402 - Looks like the pit bulls\\
403 - are herding him toward the Dobermans.\\
404 - It's beautiful, really, the way they work together.\\
405 - Did I make it? Am I alive?\\
406 - Why do I have bacon in my pocket?\\
407 - Reese, damn it, you crazy idiot!\\
408 - Do you know what you are?\\
409 - You're me!\\
410 - Mom was right-- we do love trouble.\\
411 - That's why we do stupid, moronic things like this.\\
412 - What are you talking about?\\
413 - I'm gonna be famous.\\
414 - This isn't about fame.\\
415 - It's about putting yourself in danger for no reason.\\
416 - It's an addiction to pain and suffering.\\
417 - And you know what? I'm done with it.\\
418 - And you should be, too, 'cause it isn't worth it.\\
419 - That's easy for you to say.\\
420 - You've already had the glory.\\
421 - Glory? You think this stupid, dangerous stunt gave me glory?\\
422 - I'll show you what it gave me.\\
423 - Horrible, isn't it?\\
424 - Only the middle one's functional.\\
425 - I can go now.\\
426 - I've been set free.\\
427 - Good-bye and good luck.\\
428 - 11, 12...\\
429 - He got 12!\\
430 - Reese broke the record!\\
431 - It doesn't matter!\\
432 - Didn't you people hear a word I said?\\
433 - Are you sure he got...\\
434 - What's the difference?\\
435 - That's not the point!\\
436 - What I'm trying to say is...\\
437 - Give me the bacon.\\
438 - I don't want an asterisk by my record.\\
439 - Kid, please, it's the last inning,\\
440 - you struck out four times, dropped six fly balls,\\
441 - somehow elbowed yourself in the groin.\\
442 - The good news is, I think we're all laughed out.\\
443 - Just get up there, close your eyes and swing.\\
444 - It's because she keeps...\\
445 - looking at me, on purpose!\\
446 - She has to be taught a lesson.\\
447 - Hey. Your team's down 16 to one.\\
448 - Want to get out of here?\\
449 - Oh, she would just love it if I did that, wouldn't she?\\
450 - Well, I'm not gonna give her the satisfaction.\\
451 - She's gonna learn that she can't control me.\\
452 - You know what, Malcolm, I don't date guys who are\\
453 - involved with other women.\\
454 - Especially when it's their mother.\\
455 - Good-bye.\\
456 - Okay, this is your last chance.\\
457 - Hello?\\
458 - Sure, I got time to take a survey.\\
459 - Disagree.\\
460 - I did it! I hit the ball!\\
461 - I can't...\\
462 - Finally! This will show her!\\
463 - It has to!\\
464 - Oh, man.\\
465 - I don't care, I'm going for it.\\
466 - I'll bet she planned the whole thing\\
467 - so it would end up like this.\\
468 - Now the only way I can score\\
469 - is if I'm willing to cleat my own mother in the face.\\
470 - I can't do it.\\
471 - What do you know?\\
472 - He's out!\\
473 - Honey, if you're gonna cleat someone,\\
474 - you have to remember to lead with your heel.\\
475 - Didn't you hear me, Piama?\\
476 - I got 14 toilet seats.\\
477 - I have the record again.\\
478 - You know, Mom said this is exactly how you'd react.\\
479 - So, I was reading this really interesting story\\
480 - about glass eaters...\\
481 - Nah, you don't want to hear this.\\
482 - Dewey, when are you gonna learn\\
483 - that I'm the guy who makes the decisions around here?\\
484 - Go on. Well, apparently the trick is...\\
485 - Well, that was a pretty shameful display this afternoon.\\
486 - Look, I-I was... It's all right.\\
487 - I'm not gonna ask you\\
488 - why you've been behaving like this lately,\\
489 - because I think I know.\\
490 - You're jealous of the new baby.\\
491 - And you're right-- I haven't been\\
492 - giving you enough attention lately.\\
493 - But don't worry.\\
494 - Tomorrow we're gonna go out, we're gonna get you a haircut\\
495 - and some new undershirts,\\
496 - just the two of us, okay?\\
497 - Thanks, Mom.
\subsection {Episode 13: Lois's Sister}
1 - How was the park?\\
2 - Oh, it was great.\\
3 - We had a blast.\\
4 - Hal. I know, I know, he's filthy.\\
5 - I decided to let him out to crawl around\\
6 - in the dirt for a little while,\\
7 - he had so much fun\\
8 - rolling around with the other kids.\\
9 - Lois, you should have seen him.\\
10 - Hal... Lois, you can't\\
11 - treat the boy like he's made of glass.\\
12 - He'll be fine. We can clean him up.\\
13 - The important thing is that Jamie and I had fun together.\\
14 - This isn't Jamie.\\
15 - Huh.\\
16 - I know exactly who I switched him with.\\
17 - Hi there.\\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - Boys, Aunt Susan\\
20 - will be here any minute.\\
21 - I thought I told you to clean up the kitchen.\\
22 - You heard your mother, do it again.\\
23 - No, no, no. Wait.\\
24 - No one's cleaning up.\\
25 - If Susan can't accept how we live,\\
26 - she can just get back on her high horse\\
27 - and ride off to that sterile tomb she calls a home.\\
28 - Why is Mom always so weird about Aunt Susan?\\
29 - Dad used to be Aunt Susan's boyfriend...\\
30 - until Mom stole him.\\
31 - But we don't know\\
32 - anything about it.\\
33 - We also think Francis\\
34 - is a year younger than he really is.\\
35 - Got it.\\
36 - There she is.\\
37 - Sweet.\\
38 - She brought the Mustang! Oh, man.\\
39 - Well, when you hang on to every penny\\
40 - until it screams bloody murder,\\
41 - you can afford nice things.\\
42 - I wish your father and I were better\\
43 - about that instead of frittering our money away\\
44 - on all the little extras for you boys.\\
45 - Susan!\\
46 - I'm so happy to see you!\\
47 - And I don't want you to worry about your last phone call.\\
48 - I've completely forgiven you.\\
49 - It's good to see you, too.\\
50 - I guess the drive took a little longer\\
51 - than expected?\\
52 - Well, lunch will taste fine cold.\\
53 - Hi. Hi, Aunt Susan. Hello.\\
54 - Listen to the deep voices.\\
55 - Unbelievable, Lois.\\
56 - They're almost grown\\
57 - and you're still popping them out.\\
58 - And this must be Jamie.\\
59 - Hello, sweetie.\\
60 - Hello, cutie pie.\\
61 - Hi, Susan.\\
62 - Hal.\\
63 - Look at you.\\
64 - You're such a sweetie pie.\\
65 - Uh, boys, why don't you go get\\
66 - Aunt Susan's bags out of her fancy car?\\
67 - That car is outrageous.\\
68 - Well, sometimes you just have to treat yourself.\\
69 - Oh, and I brought\\
70 - a gift for Jamie.\\
71 - Wow. Susan, thank you.\\
72 - After six months of shopping, this must be quite a card.\\
73 - Oh, it's not the card, it's what's inside.\\
74 - It's a $5,000 savings bond.\\
75 - Well, I don't know what to say.\\
76 - It's going to mature\\
77 - right around the time\\
78 - he's ready to go off to college.\\
79 - Someone should be thinking of that.\\
80 - Okay, girls, this is the wildest,\\
81 - most remote area on the entire ranch.\\
82 - You think we can handle\\
83 - a whole weekend out here?\\
84 - Brittany and Ashley want to marry you.\\
85 - No, no,\\
86 - you can't do that.\\
87 - George! George!\\
88 - I'm sorry, we have to go back.\\
89 - My ex-husband\\
90 - is trying to have my frozen eggs\\
91 - fertilized by his boyfriend.\\
92 - Come on, girls.\\
93 - Girls, Buttercups are brave in the face of disappointment.\\
94 - You know what?\\
95 - You take the van back.\\
96 - I'll watch the girls.\\
97 - Are you sure you can handle it?\\
98 - Absolutely. This is my backyard.\\
99 - Besides, look at all those merit badges.\\
100 - Can we?! Can we?! Can we?!\\
101 - Well, they have been looking forward to this for so long.\\
102 - We'll be fine.\\
103 - Where are we?\\
104 - I don't know, sweetie.\\
105 - Mr. Mountain Lion didn't give me\\
106 - enough time to grab my compass.\\
107 - I'm hungry. Yeah, well,\\
108 - I'm going to refer you back to the mountain lion thing.\\
109 - Where are we going to sleep?\\
110 - Girls, please.\\
111 - We have water, we'll find shelter\\
112 - and I know the land.\\
113 - There's food all around us.\\
114 - Look-- those are edible fungi called truffles.\\
115 - Those are deer turds.\\
116 - Okay, well, we're all\\
117 - going to learn a lot this weekend.\\
118 - That pasta was fabulous, Reese.\\
119 - How's Larry?\\
120 - He won't stop fighting with Mom.\\
121 - The other day she barged in on him\\
122 - when he was in the bathtub.\\
123 - So he stood up, yanked off her wig,\\
124 - and dried himself with it.\\
125 - Very thoroughly.\\
126 - That Larry's a keeper.\\
127 - Yeah, it's so great he's not a backstabbing weasel.\\
128 - A weasel is a horrible animal.\\
129 - Susan, I've been thinking about the gift you gave Jamie.\\
130 - I know, Lois, and you don't have to worry about it.\\
131 - I brought gifts for the other boys, too.\\
132 - Yes!\\
133 - Sitting here looking interested\\
134 - finally pays off.\\
135 - No, Susan, that's not\\
136 - what I meant.\\
137 - I'm uncomfortable with the amount.\\
138 - It's awfully extravagant.\\
139 - Oh, you think everything's extravagant.\\
140 - Now, I know how much little Dewey likes candy,\\
141 - so I got him a professional\\
142 - cotton candy machine.\\
143 - Susan, what are you doing?\\
144 - We don't own a circus.\\
145 - Well, now you can feel like you do.\\
146 - Now, I'm sorry, but you two boys\\
147 - are going to have\\
148 - to share a gift.\\
149 - I'm giving you the Mustang.\\
150 - Oh, my God! You're kidding!\\
151 - Thank you!\\
152 - I never believed\\
153 - anything Mom said about you.\\
154 - Susan, you can't give them a car.\\
155 - Mom, technically this is a transaction\\
156 - between Aunt Susan and us.\\
157 - And I'm willing to hire a lawyer to enforce it.\\
158 - You want to go there, I'll go there.\\
159 - You know, Lois,\\
160 - usually when someone gives gifts,\\
161 - people say thank you.\\
162 - Well, I'm sorry, this... sudden generosity,\\
163 - coming from you, is a little baffling.\\
164 - Oh, I'm sorry that the concept\\
165 - of opening your heart and giving\\
166 - is so baffling to you.\\
167 - I don't know, some people might not\\
168 - think of it as giving.\\
169 - Some people might think of it as just showing off.\\
170 - Oh, here we go! We're only three hours in, and we've\\
171 - already received our first visit\\
172 - from the Queen Bee of Moral Superiority.\\
173 - Oh, and here's the victim, right on schedule!\\
174 - I became the victim on my prom night\\
175 - when I walked into the garage and caught\\
176 - my boyfriend having sex with my sister\\
177 - on the hood of my car!\\
178 - Where do I look?\\
179 - There's nowhere to look.\\
180 - Dad, please, you don't have to do this.\\
181 - We love this car.\\
182 - We promise we won't try to drive it\\
183 - until you say we can.\\
184 - You think your mom and I were born yesterday?\\
185 - How can you do this?!\\
186 - Boys, please.\\
187 - I know this is hard for you to understand,\\
188 - but you're just going\\
189 - to have to realize that\\
190 - your mom and Susan are crazy.\\
191 - The sooner you learn to accept that, the better.\\
192 - Okay, girls,\\
193 - we got a nice cozy cave to sleep in,\\
194 - a big roaring fire...\\
195 - I'd say things are looking up.\\
196 - That isn't enough firewood.\\
197 - You have to keep the fire going\\
198 - all night to keep animals away.\\
199 - Okay, Meagan, Kirsten, go get more firewood,\\
200 - and make sure it's not this dumb green stuff Francis got.\\
201 - Whoa, whoa, you girls aren't going anywhere.\\
202 - It's dark out there.\\
203 - I'm in charge here and I'm telling you to stay.\\
204 - I vote Brittany to be our new leader.\\
205 - All in favor?\\
206 - Aye!\\
207 - I accept.\\
208 - Now you guys get the firewood\\
209 - and you guys move the blankets\\
210 - to the dry part of the cave.\\
211 - What are you doing? You can't change the leader.\\
212 - We voted.\\
213 - It doesn't matter.\\
214 - Now I'm the grown-up, so that puts me in charge.\\
215 - All you girls,\\
216 - you sit down, 'cause no one's going anywhere.\\
217 -     We are the Buttercups    \\
218 -     We're true blue    \\
219 -     We stick together just like glue    \\
220 -     We never doubt what we can do    \\
221 -     We're honest through and through.    \\
222 - I'm in charge.\\
223 - I'm in charge.\\
224 - This is torture.\\
225 - The car's just sitting there and no one can drive it.\\
226 - Yeah, it's like that hot nun\\
227 - who comes around every year for toy drive.\\
228 - You know what?\\
229 - We're not going to let\\
230 - Mom and Dad get away with this.\\
231 - Forget it, Reese.\\
232 - Your bolt cutters can't handle that lock.\\
233 - And Dad's bolt cutters are in the garage.\\
234 - It doesn't matter.\\
235 - You don't understand the power of my brain, Malcolm.\\
236 - It's like a deep ravine that sits in total darkness,\\
237 - but once in a while, just for a moment,\\
238 - a brilliant shaft of light shines directly down into it.\\
239 - And that is the moment I will think of a genius plan\\
240 - that will get us into that Mustang.\\
241 - So the only way for us to get out of this situation\\
242 - is dependent on you being a genius?\\
243 - Correct.\\
244 - Everything in my life has led up to this moment.\\
245 - So, where's Susan?\\
246 - She said she was out shopping,\\
247 - but I wouldn't be surprised if she was out right now\\
248 - renting herself a car so we'd have to accept her Mustang.\\
249 - She's fully capable of that.\\
250 - You know, honey, you may want to...\\
251 - Okay, never mind.\\
252 - Can you believe it?\\
253 - Classical music-- how pretentious is that?\\
254 - Well, we're just going to ignore it.\\
255 - I'm sure she has voice mail, so we'll just...\\
256 - Hello?\\
257 - Hi, Susan, this is Dr. Dumont.\\
258 - This isn't Susan. This is her sister.\\
259 - Excuse me?\\
260 - This is her sister, Lois.\\
261 - We just sound a lot alike.\\
262 - You're Susan's sister?!\\
263 - Yes.\\
264 - Her birth sister?!\\
265 - Yes. What's the problem?\\
266 - The problem is you should have been in here\\
267 - six months ago for a blood test.\\
268 - Why? What's going on here? What's wrong with Susan?\\
269 - Your sister has end-stage renal disease.\\
270 - If she doesn't get\\
271 - a donor kidney soon,\\
272 - she's going to die.\\
273 - And she told me\\
274 - she was an only child.\\
275 - Good news, girls.\\
276 - It took me all day,\\
277 - but I caught two delicious-looking lizards\\
278 - and the back half of what I'm pretty sure is a gopher.\\
279 - Meagan and Ashley built a trap and caught some rabbits.\\
280 - What's in the pot?\\
281 - We found some roots and grasses\\
282 - to make soup with.\\
283 - And we're not putting in your gross lizards.\\
284 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
285 - You can't eat that soup.\\
286 - There's no way to know\\
287 - if what you gathered is safe to eat.\\
288 - But we only picked things we saw the bunnies eating.\\
289 - I'm sorry, it's too risky.\\
290 - What are you doing?\\
291 - I'm going to dump out the soup.\\
292 - No, you're not. It's our soup.\\
293 - Okay, we've played this game long enough.\\
294 - I am in charge! I am an adult!\\
295 - And I also happen to be much bigger and stronger\\
296 - than you girls.\\
297 - So if this is the way you want to play this,\\
298 - that's fine, but I...\\
299 - Get him! Get him! Get him!\\
300 - You are on thin ice, girls!\\
301 - One more stunt like this and I won't be responsible!\\
302 - I am serious!\\
303 - Look at you.\\
304 - Now you're a sleeping sailor.\\
305 - He can try on the rest of his new outfits later.\\
306 - You know, I really missed the boat not having kids.\\
307 - I got to admit, I envy you.\\
308 - Is that why\\
309 - you're not taking my kidney? What?\\
310 - Your cell phone rang this morning. I answered it.\\
311 - It was your doctor, Susan. He told me everything.\\
312 - How could you tell him that I don't exist?\\
313 - How can you not even ask me for a kidney\\
314 - when I'm probably a perfect match?\\
315 - What kind of weird psychological issues\\
316 - are making you do this?\\
317 - Who gave you the right to answer my cell phone?!\\
318 - What is wrong with you?\\
319 - If I give you one of my kidneys, you can live.\\
320 - Well, that's the moment we've all been waiting for, isn't it?\\
321 - The almighty Lois now has the power to grant me life!\\
322 - Don't mind me. Not staying. Just getting an innocent\\
323 - child out of the line of fire. Enjoy your chat.\\
324 - See? We're already gone. Good-bye.\\
325 - Why do you always twist around everything I say\\
326 - to make it seem like I'm attacking you?\\
327 - Why do you always say "always"?\\
328 - Do you have any idea how stupid\\
329 - that makes you sound?!\\
330 - Don't change the subject!\\
331 - My God, this is the apple turnover all over again.\\
332 - Don't you dare bring up the apple turnover!\\
333 - Oh, screw it.\\
334 - I've had 15 years of therapy. I'm better than this.\\
335 - I'm talking to you!\\
336 - I am not your puppet!\\
337 - What?\\
338 - I know what I did wrong, Hal.\\
339 - I let her get away too easily.\\
340 - Well, I didn't think anything was gonna be solved\\
341 - once you got into who your goldfish liked better.\\
342 - You're right. Arguing with her accomplishes nothing.\\
343 - That's why I'm going to have a judge\\
344 - declare her mentally incompetent.\\
345 - That's never going to work, Lois.\\
346 - Are you kidding?\\
347 - Any psychiatrist spends five minutes with her\\
348 - would say that she's crazy!\\
349 - Lois, don't take this the wrong way,\\
350 - but when you two get together,\\
351 - you don't exactly have the high ground on crazy.\\
352 - Well, what am I supposed to do, Hal,\\
353 - just sit back and watch her die?\\
354 - I don't know what to do either.\\
355 - But Susan is an adult.\\
356 - You can't force someone to take a kidney.\\
357 - Hey.\\
358 - What do you think you're doing?!\\
359 - Savoring the greatest achievement\\
360 - of a life that so far\\
361 - has had some pretty mixed results.\\
362 - Get in.\\
363 - What exactly do you think\\
364 - you're going to accomplish in a car with no engine?\\
365 - There's a kegger down at the field.\\
366 - They've been without us long enough.\\
367 - Reese, you're insane!\\
368 - Yeah, you could make an argument for that.\\
369 -        \\
370 - Hello, 24-hour party people!\\
371 - Reese, you moron.\\
372 - I can't believe you think you're going to get away with...\\
373 - Cool car.\\
374 - '65 Mustang.\\
375 - Meagan.\\
376 - Meagan!\\
377 - Huh?\\
378 - Shh!\\
379 - I have something very important to tell you.\\
380 - What?\\
381 - Brittany told me that Donny Frost\\
382 - said that he likes you, but she won't tell you\\
383 - 'cause she thinks you're stuck up.\\
384 - No way!\\
385 - And also, she said those shoes she said were cute on you\\
386 - aren't cute on you at all.\\
387 - They're actually dorky.\\
388 - Why would she say such mean things?\\
389 - I think it's because she's a two-face.\\
390 - But that's not important.\\
391 - What is important is that a girl like that\\
392 - should not be the leader.\\
393 - You should be the leader.\\
394 - You're more honest than she is and prettier.\\
395 - Me? The leader?\\
396 - Totally. Together, we could make this\\
397 - the best Buttercup troop ever.\\
398 - All I need you to do is untie my hands.\\
399 - Okay.\\
400 - You are not going to regret this.\\
401 - Buttercups are always loyal!\\
402 - Think about that while you're sleeping outside!\\
403 - Yeah, driving's cool.\\
404 - I do all my thinking when I drive.\\
405 - Of course, sometimes I drive and I don't think, I just drive.\\
406 - But no matter where I drive or how much I drive,\\
407 - I find that people are still people.\\
408 - That is so true.\\
409 - Thanks for letting me wear your jacket.\\
410 - Sure. Let me ask you something.\\
411 - Do you remember last week when I said "hello" to you,\\
412 - and you said, "Look what's trying to talk to me?"\\
413 - Did I?\\
414 - So, are you nicer to me now because you realize\\
415 - we have more in common than you thought,\\
416 - or because you find our differences intriguing,\\
417 - or because now I have a car?\\
418 - Uh, probably the car. Cool.\\
419 - Sometimes I love high school.\\
420 - Hey, why don't we drive somewhere\\
421 - so we can have a little privacy?\\
422 - I don't see why we have to drive anywhere.\\
423 - It's a beautiful night, I'm with a beautiful girl,\\
424 - there are some beautiful bushes over there.\\
425 - I'll get some blankets.\\
426 - Come on, Olivia.\\
427 - You are a god.\\
428 - A god of a special universe,\\
429 - where no one thinks of consequences\\
430 - and where those of us\\
431 - constrained by intelligence and common sense\\
432 - are not allowed.\\
433 - But you have invited me in, and from now on,\\
434 - I will follow you anywhere.\\
435 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
436 - There's cop cars up at the top of the hill.\\
437 - Everybody get out of here!\\
438 - Move your damn car!\\
439 - Uh, I think the battery's dead!\\
440 - I'll jump it!\\
441 - What are you doing?!\\
442 - Come on, man! There's no engine!\\
443 - Hey, somebody stole our engine!\\
444 - Nobody's going anywhere until they give it back!\\
445 - I'm glad the cops are coming! I want names!\\
446 - I'm getting worried.\\
447 - They're supposed to be here by now.\\
448 -     Val-deri    \\
449 -     Val-dera-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha    \\
450 -     Val-deri, val-dera    \\
451 -     My knapsack on my back.    \\
452 - Oh, my God! Francis, are you all right?\\
453 - What happened to you?\\
454 - Nothing. It was great.\\
455 - It's my turn to be dragged!\\
456 - Dr. Dumont.\\
457 - Susan, what a great day.\\
458 - Yeah, dialysis. What fun.\\
459 - Too bad I left my party hat at home.\\
460 - What are you talking about?\\
461 - We're not doing dialysis today.\\
462 - You're getting your kidney today.\\
463 - What?\\
464 - Susan, we talked about this\\
465 - on the phone four days ago.\\
466 - You agreed to do the procedure today.\\
467 - Your sister's already...\\
468 - My sister?\\
469 - You're not allowed\\
470 - out of Post-Op yet.\\
471 - Post-Op?\\
472 - Yep. It turns out I was a perfect match.\\
473 - My kidney's in a cooler down the hall.\\
474 - You can either accept it or throw it in the trash.\\
475 - Oh, boy, this is not going to look good\\
476 - in front of the board.\\
477 - Are you insane?\\
478 - You had your kidney taken out after I told you no?\\
479 - Susan, hi.\\
480 - Look, I know you don't care what I think,\\
481 - but I have to let you know\\
482 - that I am so happy that you agreed to do this.\\
483 - Oh, I didn't agree to anything.\\
484 - My treacherous sister has concocted\\
485 - a gigantic tissue of lies to trap me,\\
486 - but it's not going to work!\\
487 - What?\\
488 - Well, she didn't...\\
489 - Okay, for future reference,\\
490 - this is the crazy thing I was talking about!\\
491 - I cannot believe you would be so spiteful\\
492 - as to let yourself die after what I have done for you.\\
493 - What you have done for me?\\
494 - I am so sick of this!\\
495 - You know, you actually have me looking forward\\
496 - to the afterlife.\\
497 - Good luck. Dad's there.\\
498 - Susan, please, just take the kidney.\\
499 - I don't want to lose you.\\
500 - Okay, you know what?\\
501 - Can you do me a big favor\\
502 - and just stop pretending like you care about me?\\
503 - What? Susan, I love you!\\
504 - Oh, please. You never loved me!\\
505 - You see this scar?\\
506 - When I was six and you were four,\\
507 - Dad said we didn't get dessert because we were bad\\
508 - and you dumped his pudding on his head and said,\\
509 - "Yeah? Well, neither do you," and I laughed so hard,\\
510 - I fell and hit my head on the corner of the coffee table.\\
511 - See those four freckles on your left ankle?\\
512 - We used to play connect-the-dots\\
513 - and I drew a bunny and you named it "Footy."\\
514 - And this hole in my ear\\
515 - is from when you got Dad's tackle box\\
516 - and you pierced my ears for me\\
517 - because I was too chicken to do it.\\
518 - And that cap on your tooth\\
519 - is from when Cindy Bauer called me a bitch\\
520 - and you beat the crap out of her\\
521 - and didn't think I ever knew about it.\\
522 - And this is the scar I got from the kidney I gave you\\
523 - because I love you.\\
524 - Don't you tell me I don't love you.\\
525 - Oh, for God sakes.\\
526 - All right, give me the damn kidney.\\
527 - Thank you.\\
528 - Don't get too excited.\\
529 - You know you were always the big one.\\
530 - We don't even know if it'll fit.\\
531 - Hope you boys don't think you're going anywhere.\\
532 - Don't worry.\\
533 - Until everyone who was at that party dies of old age,\\
534 - we have no reason to ever go out.\\
535 - Hey, how are you feeling?\\
536 - Well, it's been three days.\\
537 - Not so much as a thank you.\\
538 - No, I meant the incision.\\
539 - Oh. I'm still pretty sore.\\
540 - Yeah, well, Susan may not admit it, but she's grateful.\\
541 - And if it's any consolation, she took the kidney.\\
542 - You won.\\
543 - Hal, it was never about that.\\
544 - Nobody won.\\
545 - Help!\\
546 - Help!\\
547 - Help!
\subsection {Episode 14: Malcolm Dates a Family}
1 - Oh, no! Mom and Dad are gonna kill us!\\
2 - I know what to do.\\
3 - "Get out of our neighborhood.\\
4 - We hate your guts."\\
5 - It's either the Lustigs, the Andersons, the Coopers\\
6 - or the Verones. It's the Hacketts.\\
7 - Like this is gonna bring their cat back to life.\\
8 - Let's see how they like a taste of their own medicine.\\
9 - I'll get the car.\\
10 -     Life is unfair.    \\
11 - Every other Thursday night, we all go to Luigi's Pizza.\\
12 - They're the only two nights a month\\
13 - I don't cry myself to sleep.\\
14 - All right, all right.\\
15 - Stop it!\\
16 - I said  I  get winner.\\
17 - Isn't it amazing?\\
18 - Every 14 days, we magically turn into a happy family.\\
19 - And here's why.\\
20 -        \\
21 - Luigi's pizza is so good,\\
22 - it not only brings out the goodwill\\
23 - that's buried deep inside of people;\\
24 - it momentarily creates goodwill that isn't even there.\\
25 - How was your day?\\
26 - I got a "B" on my math test.\\
27 - Another exquisite\\
28 - culinary experience, Alfredo.\\
29 - Ooh!\\
30 - Doctor's orders.\\
31 - Oh, Alfredo, can you break this\\
32 - for me for the tip, please?\\
33 - Excuse me. What's this "SV" at the bottom?\\
34 - That's the service charge.\\
35 - Service charge? What service charge?\\
36 - We add 15% for the service.\\
37 - We had a lot of people stiffing the waiters.\\
38 - We've been doing it for years.\\
39 - Forcing people to tip without telling them?\\
40 - We've been double-tipping\\
41 - without realizing it all this time.\\
42 - There's a notice right here.\\
43 - That piddly little sign? That's what you use\\
44 - to justify it?\\
45 - Oh, no. Is this gonna\\
46 - be "shoe store" bad or "circus" bad?\\
47 - I think it's gonna be "ten-items-or-less aisle" bad.\\
48 - Is our car on fire? I think I hear sirens. We better go.\\
49 - You put up a little sign that nobody can read,\\
50 - and that gives you the right to steal?!\\
51 - Where is the manager?!\\
52 - I want to see the manager!\\
53 - Don't you give me that look.\\
54 - I probably won't see you for a while, Manolo.\\
55 - Lo siento mucho.\\
56 - And then she stood in the parking lot for half an hour\\
57 - waving cars away.\\
58 - My mom is horrible.\\
59 - My mom... phoned me drunk...\\
60 - on my birthday...\\
61 - wanting money.\\
62 - I'm sorry, Stevie.\\
63 - I shouldn't complain.\\
64 - Your mom walking out on you was unforgivable,\\
65 - but you know what?\\
66 - Your real friends will never abandon you.\\
67 - Hey, Angela!\\
68 - Angela Pozefsky.\\
69 - She's really cute.\\
70 - I think I might actually have a chance with her.\\
71 - For some reason, no one ever asks her out.\\
72 - Maybe she's so promiscuous\\
73 - she intimidates all the other guys.\\
74 - Yeah, I'm going with that.\\
75 - Hello, Malcolm. Hi, Angela.\\
76 - I'm glad I caught up to you. I was thinking...\\
77 - You want to ask me out, don't you?\\
78 - Well, I was planning to mutter and stumble around\\
79 - for a few minutes first, but yes.\\
80 - You want to go to the Spring Dance?\\
81 - Let me save you the trouble.\\
82 - You don't want to go out with me\\
83 - because, before you do go out with me,\\
84 - my family would have to approve, which they won't do\\
85 - without giving you a gigantic third degree.\\
86 - So why don't you just give up now,\\
87 - and let me get on with dying alone.\\
88 - You're worried about your family?\\
89 - That's not going to bother me. Oh, yeah?\\
90 - My family is unbelievably intrusive, overbearing,\\
91 - controlling and humiliating.\\
92 - You are talking to the right guy.\\
93 - Francis,\\
94 - I want you to meet Jordan,\\
95 - your new assistant.\\
96 - My what? Thank you so much for this opportunity, sir.\\
97 - Sure. Will you excuse us?\\
98 - I don't need an assistant.\\
99 - But the boy needs a job,\\
100 - and I've filled every other position here\\
101 - two times over. Oh, please?\\
102 - Francis, I'm sure you can find something for him to do.\\
103 - Okay, I'll try.\\
104 - Thank you, Francis.\\
105 - I know I have a problem hiring too many people,\\
106 - but I'm getting help.\\
107 - I am seeing three psychiatrists about it.\\
108 - I'm starting to forget\\
109 - what Luigi's pizza even tasted like.\\
110 - I told you not to brush your teeth.\\
111 - Hello.\\
112 - Yes, it is.\\
113 - Really? Really?!\\
114 - Yes! Boys! Boys!\\
115 - It's the owner of Luigi's calling\\
116 - to apologize to your mother.\\
117 - Get your jackets.\\
118 - Lois!\\
119 - The pizza gods have answered our prayers.\\
120 - Hello.\\
121 - Hi. This is Lawrence Camprisi, the owner of Luigi's.\\
122 - I heard about what happened,\\
123 - and I wanted to call personally to apologize.\\
124 - Oh? What exactly are you apologizing for?\\
125 - About the way that you were treated last Thursday.\\
126 - There's no excuse for it,\\
127 - and I couldn't feel more terrible about it.\\
128 - Well, that's very nice to hear.\\
129 - I am curious why it took two weeks\\
130 - to get an apology.\\
131 - I'm sorry,\\
132 - but, you see, I just got in from Europe,\\
133 - and I haven't even unpacked yet.\\
134 - The point is that you and your family\\
135 - are valuable customers,\\
136 - and we really want to get you back in here.\\
137 - Well, I must say, this apology has surpassed\\
138 - my expectations.\\
139 - So what kind of refund are you giving us?\\
140 - What?\\
141 - I figure we overpaid\\
142 - at least $300 over the years.\\
143 - Do you want to send us a check\\
144 - or some kind of gift certificate?\\
145 - Lady, we can't give you a refund.\\
146 - We don't have those kind of margins.\\
147 - If you can afford to pay for a trip to Europe,\\
148 - you can afford 1/20th of that\\
149 - to make things right with a customer you cheated.\\
150 - There is no pizza god.\\
151 - Well, then I doubt you care, but we are never, ever\\
152 - eating a Luigi's pizza again.\\
153 - At least we have closure.\\
154 - Okay, you asked for it.\\
155 - Don't say I didn't warn you.\\
156 - Look, I'm fine. I...\\
157 - This is my mom, my dad,\\
158 - my nana, Aunt Layla, Aunt Svidmella, Uncle Zach,\\
159 - Nick, Max and Alexandra.\\
160 - The rest are in the den.\\
161 - This is Malcolm.\\
162 - Welcome. Sit. Sit.\\
163 - So... you want to marry my daughter?\\
164 - What?\\
165 - I couldn't resist.\\
166 - I'm sorry to put you through all this,\\
167 - but our family is very protective\\
168 - of our little Angela.\\
169 - We need to know\\
170 - what kind of boy you are.\\
171 - Well, uh... I'm just normal.\\
172 - I go to Angela's school.\\
173 - I get good grades.\\
174 - Uh, I have a job three days a week at a drugstore with my mom.\\
175 - Um... never had a cavity.\\
176 - Did have all my shots.\\
177 - Religiously, I guess I would classify myself\\
178 - as a hopeful agnostic.\\
179 - I think the basic philosophical question is...\\
180 - Can we stop this? Look, he's a genius.\\
181 - He's the smartest kid in our whole school by, like, a lot.\\
182 - Really?\\
183 - Genius?\\
184 - Say something smart.\\
185 - Well, um, I'm doing a paper on cosmological inflation.\\
186 - It's a theory that says\\
187 - the reason the universe is so homogeneous\\
188 - is that right after the Big Bang,\\
189 - there was a short period\\
190 - of even more rapid growth than usual.\\
191 - I hope you mentioned the importance of scalar fields\\
192 - to the whole concept of symmetry breaking.\\
193 - Not to brag,\\
194 - but I did some pretty important work on this.\\
195 - Oh, please. Until they actually find a Higgs particle,\\
196 - it's all just empty speculation.\\
197 - Yes, dear. Women.\\
198 - I'm okay with him. You okay with him?\\
199 - Nana?\\
200 - Eh.\\
201 - She loves you!\\
202 - Come on! We're going to see how much a boy your age can eat.\\
203 - And there'll be singing!\\
204 - And I have to warn you,\\
205 - we're big Botticelli players in this family.\\
206 - How's your medieval history?\\
207 - Okay, I guess.\\
208 - Malcolm's on my team!\\
209 - One sugar, just the way you like.\\
210 - Thank you, Jordan.\\
211 - Francis? What, honey?\\
212 - I just got off the phone with my mother.\\
213 - She sounded really upset that you didn't\\
214 - send a "thank you" note for Christmas.\\
215 - I mailed it yesterday, sir.\\
216 - You sent a tasteful card\\
217 - with a pressed wildflower inside.\\
218 - I think you owe someone an apology.\\
219 - He's good.\\
220 - Allow me, sir.\\
221 - Hal, boys, dinner!\\
222 - What's this?\\
223 - It's Family Fiesta Night!\\
224 - I went to Mariachi's.\\
225 - I got four kinds of enchiladas, steak and chicken tacos,\\
226 - and a tray of empanadas.\\
227 - Malcolm!\\
228 - No, no, are you kidding? I had a great time.\\
229 - Wednesday? Yeah, absolutely.\\
230 - All right, bye.\\
231 - Who was that? Angela's dad.\\
232 - What's going on?\\
233 - Isn't this fun?!\\
234 - You're right.\\
235 - We don't need music.\\
236 - We have chips.\\
237 - And the important thing is that we're\\
238 - all together enjoying some family time.\\
239 - So let's talk.\\
240 - Who's got a good story?\\
241 - Well, today, my mom lost her mind.\\
242 - Reese.\\
243 - Look, I went to a lot of trouble here,\\
244 - and I know you boys like this stuff, so...\\
245 - what's the problem?\\
246 - Mom, any way you dress it up, it's not Luigi's.\\
247 - Luigi's pizza wasn't the point.\\
248 - The food is not what matters.\\
249 - What matters is that we're\\
250 - sitting here together enjoying each other's company.\\
251 - If you believe that, then why'd you buy all the Mexican food?\\
252 - Fine! Mexican food goes in the trash!\\
253 - Ol  .\\
254 - No, I am not Copernicus.\\
255 - Did you isolate\\
256 - something which eventually killed you?\\
257 - No, I am not Madame Curie.\\
258 - This is so cool.\\
259 - When we play at my house,\\
260 - we can only use cartoon characters.\\
261 - Cartoon characters we saw that day.\\
262 - Okay, do you believe in life after love?\\
263 - No, I am not Cher.\\
264 - We'll never beat him!\\
265 - You baked brownies?\\
266 - With walnuts.\\
267 - Your favorite.\\
268 - You made this for me?\\
269 - This is awesome.\\
270 - This is so much fun.\\
271 - I love dating Angela.\\
272 - Where is Angela?\\
273 - She went over to a girlfriend's house an hour ago.\\
274 - Oh.\\
275 - Okay.\\
276 - Are the smaller ones better, sir?\\
277 - Very much, thank you.\\
278 - I don't have to open my mouth as far.\\
279 - What were you saying, Mom?\\
280 - They have been tacking on\\
281 - this 15% service charge for the last three years.\\
282 - I mean, I'm doing the right thing\\
283 - by boycotting them, don't you think?\\
284 - I don't know, it sounds like you're making everyone else\\
285 - suffer for something only you care about.\\
286 - I don't know why I bother to talking to you, Francis.\\
287 - Would it kill you to say something supportive to me\\
288 - when I'm obviously right?\\
289 - You're blaming me? You know what..\\
290 - If you were so certain you were right,\\
291 - you wouldn't be coming to me for reassurance.\\
292 - If you were so certain you were right,\\
293 - you wouldn't be coming to me for reassurance.\\
294 - I think we got her, sir.\\
295 - Let's not dwell on our victories, Jordan.\\
296 - My ears are feeling hairy again.\\
297 - I thought I would never smell that smell again.\\
298 - Your mother's not coming home for two hours.\\
299 - That should give us plenty of time\\
300 - to eat it and destroy all the evidence.\\
301 - But I want to be clear on this.\\
302 - What we are doing here is not okay.\\
303 - It is morally reprehensible on every level.\\
304 - We should be ashamed.\\
305 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we hate ourselves.\\
306 - Now, remember, boys, whatever happens,\\
307 - we are all in this together.\\
308 - Where's Malcolm?\\
309 - He's at his other family.\\
310 - More for us.\\
311 - I can't believe how much we ate.\\
312 - I can't believe how good it tasted.\\
313 - That was the taste of evil, son.\\
314 - Gooey, delicious evil.\\
315 - I know I've got\\
316 - to cover my breath, but the thought of even eating\\
317 - this breath mint just makes me want to throw up.\\
318 - We forced ours down.\\
319 - Hey, everybody!\\
320 - I got dinner!\\
321 - It's from the Pizza Connection.\\
322 - I had to drive\\
323 - all the way across town to get it,\\
324 - but I figured I owe you boys something nice.\\
325 - I know how hard it's been going without Luigi's,\\
326 - and it means a lot to me that you're backing me up.\\
327 - There's cheese\\
328 - inside the meatballs.\\
329 - I never saw people get so passionate about\\
330 - the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory.\\
331 - I thought Nana was going to punch somebody.\\
332 - We had so much fun last night.\\
333 - I watched...\\
334 - Dad torch...\\
335 - his wedding album.\\
336 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
337 - Hey, Sarah.\\
338 - I just wanted to ask\\
339 - if you want to go to the Spring Dance with me.\\
340 - I know it's kind of late.\\
341 - Oh wow, I'd love to.\\
342 - Great, so I'll see you Friday? See you on Friday.\\
343 - Isn't it great\\
344 - when the girl asks the...\\
345 - Angela.\\
346 - I totally forgot.\\
347 - Oh, man, I've got two dates to the Spring Dance.\\
348 - It's sort of like that old episode of...\\
349 - well, every show.\\
350 - If you think about it,\\
351 - it's actually a pretty interesting challenge.\\
352 - I mean, Urkel did pretty well\\
353 - with the identical cousin trick\\
354 - until he got greedy and made himself a duke.\\
355 - And Potsie doesn't count because one of his turned out\\
356 - to be a dude.\\
357 - Stevie, are you even listening to me?\\
358 - Two girls...\\
359 - ...two families.\\
360 - I don't have...\\
361 - two lungs!\\
362 - What does that have to do with...\\
363 - People with... your luck...\\
364 - aren't allowed... to be creeps.\\
365 - Just choose!\\
366 - Yeah, all right.\\
367 - Okay, it's 7:35.\\
368 - It's a five-minute bike ride to Luigi's.\\
369 - It'll take you one minute to order the pizza,\\
370 - which means they should hand it to you\\
371 - at 7:56.\\
372 - I'll send your mother to the mall at 7:50\\
373 - and we'll destroy the evidence before she gets back.\\
374 - You know, we're going to pay for this.\\
375 - We're going to pay big.\\
376 - Yeah.\\
377 - But we're not going to pay today.\\
378 - Whatever else it's done to me,\\
379 - this whole conspiracy has made me feel so close to my boys.\\
380 - Except for Malcolm and Jamie.\\
381 - They're not like us.\\
382 - Now go!\\
383 - Hey, honey. What are you doing?\\
384 - Are those car keys?\\
385 - I'm going down to Luigi's.\\
386 - What?\\
387 - Why would you do that?\\
388 - I'm giving up.\\
389 - I've inflicted this thing on all of you long enough.\\
390 - I'm going to go down there,\\
391 - I'm going to walk up to the counter,\\
392 - and I'm going to do right by my family.\\
393 - Over my dead body.\\
394 - What?\\
395 - You can't give up now.\\
396 - I thought we were a team on this.\\
397 - Hal, you've all been wonderfully supportive,\\
398 - but maybe enough is enough.\\
399 - The woman that I love\\
400 - has never thought that enough was enough.\\
401 - The woman that I love is not going to go\\
402 - anywhere near that place in the next hour.\\
403 - We believe in you, Lois.\\
404 - You have got to fight this.\\
405 - Thank you.\\
406 - You're right.\\
407 - I will.\\
408 - Malcolm!\\
409 - Come in. Come in.\\
410 - Look who's here!\\
411 - Angela, your boyfriend is here!\\
412 - I put the leaf back in the table.\\
413 - We can reenact the battle of Lepanto\\
414 - with olives and celery!\\
415 - I can't stay.\\
416 - On Saturday,\\
417 - you and Angela must join us.\\
418 - The Taiwan acrobats are in town.\\
419 - I don't think I can make it.\\
420 - Well, you and Angela can join us for movie night.\\
421 - And I won't take "no" for an answer.\\
422 - I can't.\\
423 - Why not? What's wrong?\\
424 - He's breaking up with me.\\
425 - Which I'm totally okay with.\\
426 - We haven't even talked in two weeks.\\
427 - What were you saying? Oh, no, it's nothing.\\
428 - You're breaking up?\\
429 - Just like that?\\
430 - Yeah.\\
431 - This is really hard.\\
432 - My life is kind of complicated\\
433 - right now, and I just\\
434 - need my space.\\
435 - But I really want us to stay friends.\\
436 - "Friends."\\
437 - It's not you. It's me.\\
438 - The past few weeks\\
439 - have been great, but...\\
440 - Please. Don't.\\
441 - No, really.\\
442 - You know how amazing you guys are?\\
443 - Look, Angela's going to date\\
444 - a lot of guys...\\
445 - that are much better than me and...\\
446 - Now you're being patronizing.\\
447 - Just go.\\
448 - I'll see you around?\\
449 - We both know that's not how it works.\\
450 - This butter is just sitting here like a cube on my toast.\\
451 - It's not...\\
452 - doing that thing that Jordan does.\\
453 - Spreading?\\
454 - Yeah!\\
455 - Francis, this has to stop.\\
456 - I liked the flowers you had Jordan send me,\\
457 - and the poem he wrote was very sweet,\\
458 - but you're turning into\\
459 - a helpless infant.\\
460 - If Jordan hadn't wandered in on you\\
461 - in the men's room yesterday,\\
462 - you'd still be stuck in there.\\
463 - I would've figured it out.\\
464 - No, I wouldn't have.\\
465 - You're right. I'll let him go.\\
466 - It's for the best.\\
467 - Jordan, there's something I have to talk to you about.\\
468 - The thing is...\\
469 - You need to let me go.\\
470 - Well, yeah, and...\\
471 - You feel terrible about this, but you can't keep me,\\
472 - even though I've done an outstanding job.\\
473 - Yeah, I'm...\\
474 - Sorry. Of course you are. But you've written me\\
475 - a wonderful letter of recommendation.\\
476 - And let me thank you in advance\\
477 - for the muffin basket you'll be sending.\\
478 - It's not too expensive,\\
479 - but I will appreciate the thought.\\
480 - Good-bye, sir.\\
481 - Good-bye.\\
482 - It's best to squeeze now, sir.\\
483 - Come on. Come on. Sit down.\\
484 - Too bad Malcolm's at the dance.\\
485 - He's going to miss this. What is it?\\
486 - I was ready to give up on my war\\
487 - with Luigi's, and then your father inspired me\\
488 - to take action.\\
489 - So yesterday, I called Clyde on Your Side.\\
490 - Who? You know, that consumer guy\\
491 - on Channel 5.\\
492 - They're doing a whole expos   on Luigi's.\\
493 - They told me it was going to be on at 10:23.\\
494 - Oh, here it is.\\
495 - This may look like a friendly,\\
496 - neighborhood pizza parlor,\\
497 - but thanks to an alert tipster,\\
498 - we discovered that this hangout\\
499 - could be hanging you out to dry.\\
500 - Alert tipster, that's me.\\
501 - It turns out this eatery\\
502 - adds a secret 15% service charge to every tab.\\
503 - I want to be clear this does not reflect\\
504 - on the Italian people,\\
505 - most of whom are hard-working decent Americans.\\
506 - But for the cadre of tricksters\\
507 - here at Luigi's, we've got a tip for you:\\
508 - clean up-a you act.\\
509 - Who are the victims in this scam?\\
510 - Senior citizens on a fixed income.\\
511 - Local teens after a dance.\\
512 - And of course, the biggest price is paid...\\
513 - Oh, my God!\\
514 - That traitor!\\
515 - How could he betray the trust of this family?\\
516 - Especially you, Lois.\\
517 - Doesn't he know what you've been fighting for?\\
518 - Yeah! That betrayer!\\
519 - Look at him shove that pizza in his mouth\\
520 - right there in the restaurant\\
521 - when we have to sneak ours in the garage!\\
522 - What?!\\
523 - This isn't just the sad story of...\\
524 - All right,\\
525 - I was saving this until I needed it.\\
526 - Dad does a five-minute imitation of you on the toilet.\\
527 - I'll show you the videotape\\
528 - if you're willing to deal.\\
529 - Turns out, breaking up with Angela was a terrible mistake.\\
530 - It's sad.\\
531 - Sometimes you don't realize what you had\\
532 - until you throw it away.\\
533 - Malcolm.\\
534 - Hey.\\
535 - What are you doing here?\\
536 - I was just in the neighborhood and I was thinking maybe...\\
537 - You guys look great.\\
538 - This is really awkward.\\
539 - Yes... I'm the Earl...\\
540 - of Sandwich.
\subsection {Episode 15: Reese's Apartment}
1 - Will you look at that?\\
2 - He wants a trampoline for his birthday.\\
3 - That's so cute, but we can't afford that.\\
4 - He can get that if he doesn't have a party.\\
5 - That is perfect.\\
6 - He'll be so surprised.\\
7 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
8 -     I don't know    \\
9 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
10 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     And you're not so big    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     And you're not so big    \\
18 -     Life is unfair.    \\
19 - This is the best part of my day--\\
20 - the 16 minutes between the horrors of school\\
21 - and the horrors of home.\\
22 - Malcolm, there you are.\\
23 - You know Ira James, right?\\
24 - All-state fullback, state single season rushing record.\\
25 - Who am I kidding? He's probably never even talked to you.\\
26 - Hi.\\
27 - Ira's graduating this year.\\
28 - He's got interest from six Division 1-A colleges.\\
29 - Full rides.\\
30 - The problem is, each school wants him to write\\
31 - a personal essay on his application.\\
32 - So...?\\
33 - So Ira's an idiot.\\
34 - I mean, hamster idiot.\\
35 - And that's only if we're talking about a really stupid hamster.\\
36 - Mom says I have other nice qualities.\\
37 - Since you're the smartest kid in the school,\\
38 - I want you to help him write his essays.\\
39 - I wish I could, but I've got, like, three midterms next week.\\
40 - Look, you don't understand.\\
41 - Ira is a football player.\\
42 - That means when he needs something,\\
43 - it's up to you non-football kids to do it for him.\\
44 - The cheerleaders understand it.\\
45 - Look, I'll make it worth your while.\\
46 - I'll let you out of gym for the rest of the semester.\\
47 - I don't mind gym.\\
48 - Sure you don't, brainiac.\\
49 - Hi, honey.\\
50 - I'm going to need you to be calm.\\
51 - Aw, geez. Which kid is it?\\
52 - I'm not going to tell you.\\
53 - You're not calm enough yet.\\
54 - Reese.\\
55 - Okay, deep breath.\\
56 - What'd he do?\\
57 - All right.\\
58 - Reese...\\
59 - That... glubber...!\\
60 - That... sniggit...!\\
61 - I'm gonna...\\
62 - Honey, do you want some tea or a drink?\\
63 - What's wrong with Dad? Your father just\\
64 - found out what Reese did.\\
65 - What'd he do? Your brother...\\
66 - Oh, my God!\\
67 - Did they have to evacuate?!\\
68 - Glurb...\\
69 - Oh, man, what a day.\\
70 - Vic lost his other one in the meat grinder,\\
71 - and the health department shut us down for 15 minutes.\\
72 - We were playing catch up all afternoon.\\
73 - You sit down.\\
74 - He wants to know\\
75 - how you could do something so horrible.\\
76 - And think you could get away with it?\\
77 - Was that "scramble" or "strangle"?\\
78 - What are you guys talking about?\\
79 - You know very well what we're talking about.\\
80 - Last week, you...\\
81 - I can name Third World countries\\
82 - where stuff like that happens all the time.\\
83 - What am I going to do with you, Reese?\\
84 - I don't want to tell you this is a new low,\\
85 - because every time I do,\\
86 - you take it as a personal challenge!\\
87 - You know what?\\
88 - I've just worked my butt off for six hours,\\
89 - and I don't appreciate getting yelled at\\
90 - the second I come through the door.\\
91 - You're complaining?\\
92 - No... complain!\\
93 - Yell... us!\\
94 - Hal, give yourself another minute.\\
95 - Or you both could just shut up.\\
96 - Oh, boy.\\
97 - In this family, that's what we call "the closer."\\
98 - We now know that Reese is definitely\\
99 - not living here for the next few days.\\
100 - The only question left is who gets to take the credit.\\
101 - You're kicked out! I'm leaving!\\
102 - Not if we get to the doorknob first!\\
103 - You're outta here! I'm outta here!\\
104 - Tie goes to the runner.\\
105 - They kicked Reese out again?\\
106 - Yeah, we haven't heard from him in two days.\\
107 - I'm actually impressed.\\
108 - Usually by now he's eating cat food\\
109 - off of Mrs. Harvey's porch.\\
110 - This is horrible.\\
111 - How can they do this to their own children?\\
112 - Yeah, it's really traumatizing me.\\
113 - Don't they care\\
114 - about the psychological damage they're inflicting?\\
115 - A home isn't conditional.\\
116 - A home should be\\
117 - safe and secure and...\\
118 - Roomy. What?\\
119 - The point is, I got kicked out when I was 15\\
120 - and I never got to come home again.\\
121 - They can't do this to Reese.\\
122 - Someone has to do something. Someone has to stop them.\\
123 - Am I the only one who understands\\
124 - what kind of monsters these people are?\\
125 - I don't think this is as big a deal\\
126 - to the rest of the family as it is to you.\\
127 - Maybe you're overreacting.\\
128 - Overreacting?\\
129 - Dewey, when you're older, you will understand.\\
130 - There are things in life called priorities,\\
131 - which I will explain to you in a few hours when I get there.\\
132 - Right now, I have to call Otto and cash in some personal days.\\
133 - Overreacting.\\
134 - Great timing. The muffins just came out.\\
135 - Thank God you called me.\\
136 - I can't believe the hell Mom and Dad put you through.\\
137 - Hey, whose place is this?\\
138 - It's mine.\\
139 - It's completely furnished, including cable TV.\\
140 - I told them I was 18, so I got a two-year lease.\\
141 - You're a banana- walnut man, right?\\
142 - Reese, you can't live in a place like this.\\
143 - Yeah, I can.\\
144 - They were having a move-in special.\\
145 - First month free.\\
146 - It's only $375 a month,\\
147 - utilities included.\\
148 - I can make my rent in a week if I pick up an extra shift.\\
149 - I should have done this, like, six months ago.\\
150 - Hey, Reese, come on, we're going to the roof.\\
151 - The nursing students across the street\\
152 - are taking their cigarette break.\\
153 - I'm sorry, I can't.\\
154 - I'm having my brothers over for breakfast.\\
155 - Francis, this is Teddy,\\
156 - Lou, George.\\
157 - Divorced, separated, wife's doing the best friend.\\
158 - Ex-best friend.\\
159 - Excuse me.\\
160 - All right, well, you know where we'll be.\\
161 - Hey, is that a wedding ring?\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - Start hiding the money now, friend.\\
164 - Come on, let's go.\\
165 - Oh, man, this place is awesome.\\
166 - Reese, I know you think this place is great,\\
167 - but any objective observer will tell you\\
168 - it's most certainly not.\\
169 - Whoa!\\
170 - This place is awesome!\\
171 - One thing's for sure.\\
172 - I'd never, ever leave if I were you.\\
173 - So who's up for some muffins?\\
174 - I am. Me. No! No muffins.\\
175 - Reese, you can't just keep playing house like this.\\
176 - Mom and Dad did something really horrible to you,\\
177 - just like they did to me,\\
178 - only you can't let them get away with it.\\
179 - You don't belong here. You belong at home.\\
180 - All right, fine.\\
181 - Tell me one thing about my life\\
182 - that would be better if I was still at home.\\
183 - I thought the "toilet seat never needs warming" argument\\
184 - was pretty good.\\
185 - Okay, the main thing to remember is that a college essay\\
186 - is just like any other essay you've written.\\
187 - You know, like homework.\\
188 - For one of your classes.\\
189 - Come on, Ira, I know it seems hard,\\
190 - but you just have to get started.\\
191 - Like, if you had to describe yourself in one word,\\
192 - what would that word be?\\
193 - Ira.\\
194 - Okay. There we go.\\
195 - "Ira."\\
196 - See? We started.\\
197 - Now, what else? I don't know.\\
198 - I'm not much of a writer or a reader.\\
199 - I don't like words.\\
200 - They confuse me.\\
201 - There's, like, hundreds of them.\\
202 - Calm down. You can do this.\\
203 - You know what?\\
204 - I'm going to say something,\\
205 - and you just say the first thing that comes to your head.\\
206 - My earliest memory in life is...\\
207 - Blue.\\
208 - Thing.\\
209 - Blue thing.\\
210 - Good, you can use that.\\
211 - Like, um...\\
212 - "Sometimes my childhood\\
213 - "feels vague and distant,\\
214 - like something draped in a blue haze."\\
215 - See?\\
216 - Yeah. That's cool.\\
217 - Okay, my biggest fear is...\\
218 - Spiders.\\
219 - No-- waffles.\\
220 - "I let my fears wash over me and I see that I am\\
221 - "imprinted with a repeating pattern\\
222 - of optimism and despair."\\
223 - Hey, that's not bad.\\
224 - "I hope someday\\
225 - "to free myself,\\
226 - to find the one thing..."\\
227 - You're not going to do anything?\\
228 - You have to go to that apartment\\
229 - and get him back.\\
230 - Look, that's not how it works.\\
231 - Oh, I know how it works.\\
232 - I was thrown into military school so fast,\\
233 - I still had shampoo in my hair.\\
234 - The minute a child\\
235 - is inconvenient to you, you kick him out.\\
236 - Francis, this is really none of your business.\\
237 - You don't even live here anymore.\\
238 - Because you kicked me out!\\
239 - And now you're doing the same thing to Reese.\\
240 - Right now he's sitting in that apartment\\
241 - with his cable TV\\
242 - and his huge stack of video games...\\
243 - miserable.\\
244 - If Reese is unhappy, he brought it on himself.\\
245 - Really? So what's this?\\
246 - Like the tenth time he's "brought it on himself"?\\
247 - And let's see,\\
248 - Malcolm's "brought it on himself" six times,\\
249 - so with my 28 times, that makes...\\
250 - 40 kick-outs,\\
251 - three different kids, and the only constant\\
252 - through all of this is you two.\\
253 - Francis, that is not fair.\\
254 - Maybe you just don't like sharing\\
255 - your house with your children.\\
256 - So when's Dewey going to "bring it on himself"?\\
257 - When's Jamie?\\
258 - Where is Jamie?\\
259 - He's at the babysitter's.\\
260 - Just till 5:00.\\
261 - Oh, for the love of God, Carol,\\
262 - leave me my dignity.\\
263 - Okay, take my dignity.\\
264 - Just let me see my kids.\\
265 - Just pull the trigger.\\
266 - In one second, it'll all be over.\\
267 - Come on, stop being such a coward and do it!\\
268 - Hey, Dave, is that you?\\
269 - Uh... yeah.\\
270 - What channel do you have on in there?\\
271 - It sounds better than what I'm watching.\\
272 - This is all...\\
273 - new to us.\\
274 - We've never...\\
275 - examined our parenting before.\\
276 - It always seemed to us\\
277 - like something that should just come naturally.\\
278 - Yeah, everything on the planet's\\
279 - been having kids for billions of years.\\
280 - I mean, look at snakes.\\
281 - They never take parenting classes.\\
282 - The world's crawling with them.\\
283 - How exactly did you want me to help you?\\
284 - Well, we have fallen into a bad pattern.\\
285 - Our boys misbehave and they are punished.\\
286 - And then they severely\\
287 - misbehave and they are\\
288 - severely punished.\\
289 - And then they misbehave in some outlandish,\\
290 - jaw-dropping way where, if we responded in kind,\\
291 - we'd end up in jail.\\
292 - We're at the end of our rope here.\\
293 - Well, of course you are.\\
294 - So, we were hoping that with all your training,\\
295 - you could teach us some kind of subtle trick\\
296 - that would stop them in their tracks.\\
297 - Trick?\\
298 - Yeah, you know,\\
299 - some kind of secret psychological thing\\
300 - that would get them to shut up and listen to us for a change.\\
301 - Yeah, my husband's getting older.\\
302 - I mean, he can still take them individually,\\
303 - but if they ever team up on him...\\
304 - Look, I don't think it's a good idea\\
305 - to treat kids like criminals or animals that need to be broken.\\
306 - You've never met our boys.\\
307 - Yeah, you can't begin to imagine the things they do.\\
308 - I've been practicing psychiatry for 40 years.\\
309 - There's nothing you could say that would shock me.\\
310 - All right.\\
311 - Last week, Reese...\\
312 - Oh, my God! What were the cats for?\\
313 - We don't know.\\
314 - Give me a minute.\\
315 - Now...\\
316 - even in the most extreme, breathtakingly horrifying cases,\\
317 - there are some techniques that can be useful.\\
318 - Yes! See, I told you this wasn't a waste of 90 bucks.\\
319 - Have you ever heard of Active Listening?\\
320 - No.\\
321 - Most teenagers act out because they feel no one cares.\\
322 - With Active Listening, you mirror back\\
323 - everything your child says,\\
324 - which shows you're hearing them,\\
325 - and, by extension, understanding.\\
326 - I know. It sounds simple.\\
327 - But believe me, I've seen it work miracles.\\
328 - Yeah, I don't think Reese would respond to that.\\
329 - You're worried it won't help him.\\
330 - Yes! What if it actually makes it worse?\\
331 - I don't think\\
332 - I could stand\\
333 - any more trouble with him.\\
334 - Oh, this is so confusing!\\
335 - You're feeling mixed-up right now.\\
336 - God, yes, I am. You know, I'm usually\\
337 - so sure of myself,\\
338 - but this whole thing\\
339 - has just made me question every aspect of...\\
340 - Oh, that's good.\\
341 - Oh, that's really good.\\
342 - "...I now realize\\
343 - "that blue is not the color of confusion,\\
344 - "but rather,\\
345 - it is the color of hope."\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - That's it.\\
348 - Dude, the parts I understood... they were awesome.\\
349 - Great, well, now that we have the ideas all down,\\
350 - all we have to do is put it into the kind of words\\
351 - that you would actually...\\
352 - Thanks, Malcolm. You're awesome.\\
353 - People are going to think I'm so smart.\\
354 - Wait! We're not done yet. Hold on a second...\\
355 - Blue is definitely my favorite color now.\\
356 - Hey! Let's get going, Reese.\\
357 - It's Ladies-Get-Free-Shrimp Night at the Red Lobster.\\
358 - Maybe I'll meet you down there.\\
359 - I got to get a jump on my homework.\\
360 - Hey, you already blew off\\
361 - Air Hockey Night and Pot Luck Wednesday,\\
362 - but I was counting on you for tonight.\\
363 - I need someone to turn the conversation to my tongue trick.\\
364 - I guess now that I'm on my own,\\
365 - I just feel like being more responsible.\\
366 - Hey, I got three kids.\\
367 - You don't see me talking about responsibility.\\
368 - Come on, I'm not taking no for an answer.\\
369 - Okay, okay.\\
370 - Mom? I have a problem. I need to talk.\\
371 - Good.\\
372 - You can talk, and I will listen.\\
373 - This football player wants to use an essay I wrote\\
374 - for his college application and pretend it's his own.\\
375 - I know it's dishonest,\\
376 - but I might be making too much of it.\\
377 - I wanted to get your advice.\\
378 - You're hoping I can help you.\\
379 - Yeah, I just said that.\\
380 - So, I don't think he should get\\
381 - into college under false pretenses,\\
382 - but are they really false pretenses\\
383 - if nobody thinks he's smart anyway?\\
384 - I don't want to be a part\\
385 - of his cheating, but I also don't want\\
386 - to take away his shot at going to college.\\
387 - I just don't know what to do.\\
388 - You're uncertain...\\
389 - what action to take.\\
390 - Yes!\\
391 - Why are you talking like a robot?\\
392 - You want to know why I'm...\\
393 - talking like a robot.\\
394 - I have a problem, and I need your help!\\
395 - All you're doing is mindlessly parroting back what I say!\\
396 - You say one thing, and I restate it.\\
397 - Forget it! If you're not going to help me,\\
398 - you don't have to mock me!\\
399 - We do not come from a family of criminals.\\
400 - You do not let him turn in that essay!\\
401 - God, I knew listening to our kids would be a mistake.\\
402 - Hello?\\
403 - Hello. Is this the residence\\
404 - of the most un-nurturing, callous parents\\
405 - in the universe?\\
406 - It's for you.\\
407 - Hello.\\
408 - Hi. I just got off the phone with your son, Reese.\\
409 - It's been over a week,\\
410 - and you haven't even talked to him?\\
411 - Congratulations! The fracturing\\
412 - of this family is now two-fifths complete.\\
413 - Francis, this is a very hard and complicated situation,\\
414 - and I don't need you to yell at me right now.\\
415 - There is nothing complicated about it.\\
416 - Just go to his apartment, tell him you love him\\
417 - and ask him to come home.\\
418 - Are you nuts?\\
419 - This is Reese we're talking about.\\
420 - So what? Come on! You know exactly how he thinks.\\
421 - If we show that kind of weakness,\\
422 - it's like showing a hyena the belly of an antelope.\\
423 - Reese will come home with no limits and no boundaries.\\
424 - Within five years, we will be saying\\
425 - our last words to him over a police bullhorn.\\
426 - All I know is that you have a child that needs you.\\
427 - No, he doesn't!\\
428 - He's happy where he is, and so are we!\\
429 - Dewey, get off the phone.\\
430 - Mom, I understand what you're worried about,\\
431 - but there is more to Reese than you give him credit for.\\
432 - I wish I could believe that.\\
433 - Honey, I got to go. There's another call.\\
434 - What'd he...?\\
435 - Hello.\\
436 - Yes, this is she.\\
437 - This is Peter Noyes, Reese's chemistry teacher.\\
438 - I'm sure you remember me from last year's hearing.\\
439 - There's something...\\
440 - new I have to discuss with you.\\
441 - Oh, my God! What did he do now?\\
442 - Your son...\\
443 - He got an "A" on his midterm?!\\
444 - They matched the handwriting,\\
445 - they had him reenact the experiment.\\
446 - He did it himself.\\
447 - Mr. Noyes said it's the most remarkable turnaround\\
448 - he's ever seen.\\
449 - Wow!\\
450 - He also said that we should be really proud of ourselves.\\
451 - Hey, Ira.\\
452 - Listen, do you have that essay I wrote?\\
453 - I just wanted to make one quick change.\\
454 - Yeah.\\
455 - Here it is.\\
456 - The change I want to make is this.\\
457 - Was it too long?\\
458 - No!\\
459 - Listen to me, Ira.\\
460 - Everyone gives you breaks.\\
461 - Everyone does everything for you.\\
462 - You might think it's good, but it's not.\\
463 - They're telling you you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.\\
464 - You can write this essay.\\
465 - You can write this essay on your own.\\
466 - Remember that story you told me about\\
467 - the two-pound steak you once ate?\\
468 - You thought it'd be impossible, but you took it\\
469 - one bite at a time, and you did it.\\
470 - You just need to do the same thing with your essay.\\
471 - Okay, I'll try.\\
472 - "And then I pretended I was Rocky,\\
473 - "and I told Mr. T, 'Go for it.'\\
474 - "I really wished his Mohawk fell off\\
475 - "when he got hit.\\
476 - The end."\\
477 - Thanks, Malcolm. This is the most words\\
478 - I've ever put together in my life.\\
479 - Yeah.\\
480 - I-It shows.\\
481 - Mmm!\\
482 - This is amazing.\\
483 - I think the lemon zest really brings it to life.\\
484 - How's your dinner?\\
485 - I'm having half-frozen Lean Cuisine.\\
486 - Not much of a last meal, if you ask me!\\
487 - What are you doing here?\\
488 - Can we come in?\\
489 - Sure. You want some dinner?\\
490 - No, but thank you, Reese.\\
491 - Seriously. I just got a convection oven.\\
492 - I can whip you up a frittata in, like, ten minutes.\\
493 - It's spotless.\\
494 - Reese, we came here to do something.\\
495 - It goes against all of our instincts,\\
496 - and even as I'm about to do it, it doesn't feel right.\\
497 - But... it seems our instincts aren't\\
498 - very good lately, so... here goes.\\
499 - What is it?\\
500 - Reese, we love you,\\
501 - and we think you might be better off staying here.\\
502 - Really?\\
503 - Honest to God, you seem to be\\
504 - doing much better without us.\\
505 - I mean, let's face it,\\
506 - in 17 years with us, you have spent\\
507 - more days in juvenile court than you have in school.\\
508 - But now, after ten days on your own, you...\\
509 - you're a functioning member of society.\\
510 - Wow!\\
511 - I must have really changed.\\
512 - I don't even want to rub it in.\\
513 - Mail call!\\
514 - I confiscated your Victoria's Secret catalog.\\
515 - A kid your age should... Oh, you're entertaining.\\
516 - Teddy, these are my parents.\\
517 - Mom, Dad, this is my neighbor, Teddy.\\
518 - Hello. This visitation thing's\\
519 - a real pain in the ass, huh?\\
520 - You know, this place isn't so bad.\\
521 - Next time we come, we can bring some plants.\\
522 - Sweet! Hold on a sec.\\
523 - Hi, I just got your Deluxe Platinum Card,\\
524 - and I want to activate it.\\
525 - "Two-four-seven-one."\\
526 - Now, listen, I already transferred a $3,000 balance\\
527 - from the Valley Federal Card\\
528 - over to my Spring Mills Mutual Card,\\
529 - because I had an $8,000 limit.\\
530 - But since I'm already bumping against that,\\
531 - I might as well transfer everything to yours,\\
532 - because it has a $20,000 limit.\\
533 - Sure, I'd love to talk to a supervisor.\\
534 - Hey! I was on the phone!\\
535 - You've been using credit cards?\\
536 - How much have you spent?\\
537 - Ten, 11 grand.\\
538 - But I'm still\\
539 - way under the $20,000 limit.\\
540 - How can you spend that much in ten days?\\
541 - Well, you know, I got that new convection oven,\\
542 - and that made the refrigerator look kind of shabby.\\
543 - Plus, I had to buy new clothes\\
544 - every time mine got dirty.\\
545 - And that giant gong in the bathroom?\\
546 - I mean, how do you guys do it?\\
547 - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\\
548 - Reese, I really owe you some thanks\\
549 - for giving me some faith in myself.\\
550 - The next few days, I will be saying very little.\\
551 - I will be deciding on a punishment.\\
552 - Ideas are already popping into my mind.\\
553 - It's really very exciting, but I don't want to get hasty\\
554 - and leave either of us feeling dissatisfied.\\
555 - Ow! You're going to drag me all the way home?\\
556 - Well, we're taking your ear there.\\
557 - If the rest of you wants to come, that's fine, too.\\
558 - It's been almost a month, and Mom's still coming up\\
559 - with fresh punishments for Reese.\\
560 - She says she's never felt more creative.\\
561 - She must be doing something right.\\
562 - He has a white streak in his hair.\\
563 - Hey, Malcolm. Guess what.\\
564 - I got accepted. I'm going to college.\\
565 - Really? Which school?\\
566 - All of them-- A&M, Tulane, Georgia, Stanford.\\
567 - Full scholarships and everything.\\
568 - Stanford liked your essay?\\
569 - No, I forgot to put it in the envelope. I got in, anyway.\\
570 - But don't worry. That essay didn't go to waste.\\
571 - I handed it in as my math midterm and got an "A."\\
572 - Thanks for making me believe in myself, Malcolm.\\
573 - You proved that I don't need all these people helping me.\\
574 - See ya.\\
575 - Stanford. Poor guy.\\
576 - I'll bet he doesn't know it only has\\
577 - the third-best astrophysics department in the country.
\subsection {Episode 16: Malcolm Visits College}
1 - No more junk food.\\
2 - From now on we are going to be a family that eats healthy.\\
3 - Brownie? Mmm.\\
4 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
5 -     I don't know    \\
6 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
7 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
8 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
9 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
10 -     And you're not so big    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     Life is unfair.    \\
16 - I have my first college visit coming up.\\
17 - I get to stay overnight in a dorm, tour the campus\\
18 - and spend 18 hours pretending my family doesn't exist.\\
19 - I actually skipped all the way to school today.\\
20 - I probably should've stopped\\
21 - once I passed the football field, but who cares?\\
22 - My body may have been stuffed in a trash can,\\
23 - but my mind was taking a shower with a college chick.\\
24 - Come on, there's tons of reasons\\
25 - to go out with a guy like me.\\
26 - To make your dad mad, or your boyfriend jealous.\\
27 - Maybe you just hate yourself, or have a sick curiosity.\\
28 - I don't know! I can't do all the work for you!\\
29 - I thought I at least I had a chance with the fat ride.\\
30 - Did you actually call her that?\\
31 - Hey, I didn't make her fat.\\
32 - Who is that?\\
33 - That's Christie. She's the new narc.\\
34 - We have a new narc?\\
35 - What happened to Druggie Dougie?\\
36 - He got served divorce papers in history class.\\
37 - Aw, come on, she's so cute.\\
38 - She's a narc?\\
39 - Hey, papers? Anyone got papers?\\
40 - Hey, papers? Anybody got papers?\\
41 - Do you even know anyone who does drugs?\\
42 - Why are you asking me? I don't have any friends.\\
43 - But sometimes, I do have brilliant ideas.\\
44 - Where are you going?\\
45 - Malcolm, I live in a world of what the hells.\\
46 - Ooh...\\
47 - Oh, man, I am so...\\
48 - Never mind.\\
49 - You can't do this to me!\\
50 - Dad's supposed to take me, not you!\\
51 - Malcolm, this is your first visit to a university.\\
52 - Your father and I talked it over and we both agreed.\\
53 - This is a big deal, we don't want to blow it.\\
54 - If I come along, I can make sure\\
55 - that you don't say or do anything that you shouldn't.\\
56 - I can take a little of the pressure off you.\\
57 - Wait a second.\\
58 - You guys are talking about college for Malcolm and not me?\\
59 - I'm a year older than he is.\\
60 - Why aren't you taking me\\
61 - to look at colleges?\\
62 - Well, son...\\
63 - I'm just screwing with you. Relax.\\
64 - Dewey, dinner.\\
65 - I guess he'll eat it cold again.\\
66 - What the hell\\
67 - are you doing back here?!\\
68 - The pianos are for paying customers only!\\
69 - You're wearing out the keys!\\
70 - Hey!\\
71 - I'm not going to buy you a piano.\\
72 - You've never even had lessons.\\
73 - I don't need lessons.\\
74 - I already know how to play.\\
75 - I'm great. Look.\\
76 - That's very cute, Dewey, but we can't afford a piano.\\
77 - Do you know how close my company is to going out of business?\\
78 - They're selling our office furniture\\
79 - and forcing us to have desk buddies.\\
80 - Dad, you don't know me very well,\\
81 - but you couldn't have missed the fact\\
82 - that I'm having a horrible childhood.\\
83 - Now there's a chance\\
84 - for you to make it suck a little less.\\
85 - I said no. End of discussion.\\
86 - Now you're just going to have to find\\
87 - some other way to amuse yourself.\\
88 - I don't understand it.\\
89 - I told all of the guests\\
90 - about my Hayride for Lovers on Friday night,\\
91 - and no one signed up.\\
92 - Well, most of the guests have children.\\
93 - They can't just abandon them\\
94 - to go on a couples-only hayride.\\
95 - We're only allowing couples.\\
96 - Ah, well, then there-- there is the solution.\\
97 - We will start a child-care center.\\
98 - Ooh, Otto, I don't think...\\
99 - It will be wonderful.\\
100 - We will have posture contests,\\
101 - and I can show them slides\\
102 - of my childhood in postwar Germany.\\
103 - They will love it.\\
104 - Otto, as great as that idea is, I wouldn't set my heart on it.\\
105 - These people came here to spend time with their families.\\
106 - They're not just going to dump their children\\
107 - the first chance they get.\\
108 - Can we leave them overnight?\\
109 - ...and the delivery's on time? Good.\\
110 - I've got a lot of hungry customers.\\
111 - Oh, hey, Christie, I didn't see you.\\
112 - Are you ready? I think you're going to be\\
113 - pleasantly surprised by how much ice cream I can eat.\\
114 - Look, Reese, um, you know, we got coffee,\\
115 - and we saw a movie, and we went skating.\\
116 - I thought hanging out with you would involve a little more...\\
117 - partying.\\
118 - Don't you have like a friend\\
119 - or maybe someone you know of\\
120 - or someone you heard rumors about that could help us out?\\
121 - Hey, I got to trust somebody before I party with them.\\
122 - You trust me, don't you?\\
123 - Not yet, but there must be\\
124 - some way a hot girl like you\\
125 - can get a desperate guy like me to trust you.\\
126 - Hey, why don't we go park by the river\\
127 - and see if we can think of something.\\
128 - I hope you weren't hunched over like that during your interview.\\
129 - Why didn't you tell him about your extracurricular activities?\\
130 - How do you even know what I said?\\
131 - Did you have your ear pressed up against the door?\\
132 - You should be a little less concerned about what I did\\
133 - and a little bit more concerned about your own performance.\\
134 - And next time say "bless you" when he sneezes.\\
135 - These people are looking for any excuse not to like you.\\
136 - All right, 230.\\
137 - You walked me to my dorm room, you chose my lunch,\\
138 - you tucked in my shirt in the middle of orientation.\\
139 - Now will you please just leave?\\
140 - Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me?\\
141 - Because I'm supposed to be doing this stuff on my own.\\
142 - I'm just here to make sure you do it on your own the right way.\\
143 - Hi. Are you Malcolm? Yeah.\\
144 - I'm Paula. And this is Andrea and Scott.\\
145 - I guess we're all going to be roommates tonight.\\
146 - Cool. Well, I'll put my bags, uh...\\
147 - Excuse me. You mean you boys and you girls\\
148 - are staying in the same room?\\
149 - Yeah. It'll be just like really being in college.\\
150 - There. Now we'll all have\\
151 - the same version of what happened here.\\
152 - That's exactly what I would have done, Lois.\\
153 - Yep. Camped out in the room.\\
154 - You didn't happen to take the oven timer, did you?\\
155 - I can't understand this...\\
156 - All week stuff has been disappearing\\
157 - right from under my nose.\\
158 - It's like I put something down, and then it's just gone.\\
159 - No, it's not even anything worth stealing.\\
160 - It's as if someone is trying to make me crazy on purpose.\\
161 - You're probably right.\\
162 - I love you, too. Bye.\\
163 - What the...?\\
164 - Can I please have some more lemonade?\\
165 - What a wonderfully polite little boy.\\
166 - Please, take a sewing kit\\
167 - und  a small moisturizer.\\
168 - Otto, none of the parents showed up for the hayride.\\
169 - Their kids are here.\\
170 - It's so weird.\\
171 - Nobody's answering their phones,\\
172 - so I went by all their rooms.\\
173 - They all have Do Not Disturb...\\
174 - Oh.\\
175 - I guess I better go get a pep talk ready\\
176 - for housekeeping in the morning.\\
177 - Mom, what are you doing with my underwear?!\\
178 - You had it all crammed up there in the corner.\\
179 - Wrinkled clothes are the sign of a disorganized mind.\\
180 - So then I took a guided tour\\
181 - of the Plaza de Espana in Barthelona.\\
182 - I'm not mispronouncing it.\\
183 - That's the way they say it. Barthelona.\\
184 - That is so interesting.\\
185 - I wish I was more interesting.\\
186 - Do you think it would be pretentious to use\\
187 - the word "legerdemain" into a conversation with the dean?\\
188 - What am I saying?\\
189 - Of course it's pretentious. I'm such a lackwit.\\
190 - Relax. If you can't be pretentious in college,\\
191 - where can you be pretentious?\\
192 - Really? So when I get to college\\
193 - it'd be okay if I called myself Antigone?\\
194 - Of course.\\
195 - All right, kid, here's the deal, my name is Leland.\\
196 - More importantly, I'm the RA,\\
197 - which stands for Resident Advisor,\\
198 - which means I'm in charge of this floor.\\
199 - So you're going to have to keep the music down.\\
200 - Is it really that loud?\\
201 - Listen, guy,\\
202 - I can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare.\\
203 - Now turn the radio down.\\
204 - Is there a problem here?\\
205 - Who are you?\\
206 - I'm his mother. I'm supervising these kids\\
207 - in this coed room\\
208 - which I cannot believe your school condones.\\
209 - You know, ma'am, that's not what I'm here about.\\
210 - That radio is at least five dBs above the approved noise level.\\
211 - I'd hate to have to confiscate it\\
212 - or move on to more serious consequences.\\
213 - You know what, Leland?\\
214 - I've been to college.\\
215 - I know exactly how much power\\
216 - and authority an RA has.\\
217 - Good night.\\
218 - Wow.\\
219 - Malcolm, your mom is awesome.\\
220 - I am so glad you brought her.\\
221 - This horn's from Dad's van,\\
222 - and this one's from Mom's car\\
223 - and this one's from the ice cream truck.\\
224 - Dewey. What are you doing?\\
225 - The spout fell down.\\
226 - I'm fixing it.\\
227 - Good boy.\\
228 - Listen, I talked with Mrs. Hittelman down the block and she said\\
229 - that if you want, you can use her piano.\\
230 - Thanks anyway, Dad, but I found something else to amuse myself.\\
231 - Oh. Well, good.\\
232 - Hey, have you seen my hair dryer?\\
233 - I swear, it's like stuff is just getting up and walking off.\\
234 - Either that or someone's\\
235 - messing with me.\\
236 - Dad, I think I figured out what's going on.\\
237 - Somebody's sneaking into the house\\
238 - and stealing stuff.\\
239 - Probably punks.\\
240 - No, not punks, son.\\
241 - Just good kids who got lost along the way.\\
242 - Either way, they're going down.\\
243 - And then the priest said, "Those aren't my galoshes."\\
244 - Mom is actually letting me walk all the way\\
245 - to the vending machine and back\\
246 - without tying a string to my waist.\\
247 - Ha.\\
248 - This moment is almost as sweet\\
249 - as the candy you can't have.\\
250 - Wow. Denied candy.\\
251 - If I were 12 years younger,\\
252 - I guess I'd cry.\\
253 - What's going on out here?\\
254 - Oh, God, no.\\
255 - The snack bar is closed.\\
256 - You're denying my son candy?.\\
257 - Mom, it doesn't matter.\\
258 - I'll just go down to the next floor.\\
259 - Use of the vending machine is a privilege, not a right.\\
260 - If my son wants a candy bar,\\
261 - he can have a candy bar.\\
262 - You don't get to decide for him.\\
263 - I get to decide.\\
264 - Do I even need to be here for this?\\
265 - Since I'm the one with the key to the lock,\\
266 - I think  I'm  in charge.\\
267 - Come on.\\
268 - This isn't over yet.\\
269 - Mom, why don't you\\
270 - just put me in a diaper?\\
271 - One thing at a time, Malcolm.\\
272 - First, we're going to get you that candy.\\
273 - ...and my parents\\
274 - they just drive me crazy.\\
275 - I just need to ditch reality and escape sometimes.\\
276 - You know what I mean?\\
277 - Look, Christie, here's the thing.\\
278 - When I first met you, I was just messing around,\\
279 - but we've gotten so close that now...\\
280 - I really like you.\\
281 - I can't keep this up anymore.\\
282 - What do you mean?\\
283 - I'm not the person you think I am.\\
284 - I've been pretending since the day I met you.\\
285 - It's so hard having to constantly cover my tracks\\
286 - to keep my story straight,\\
287 - and I don't want to anymore.\\
288 - I'm tired of living this lie.\\
289 - Reese, I think I know your secret.\\
290 - No, actually, you don't, but it doesn't matter\\
291 - 'cause I'm done with it.\\
292 - I'm sorry.\\
293 - Did you get all that?\\
294 - Yeah, it looks like he's going straight.\\
295 - So if we're going to bust this kid, we better do it now.\\
296 - All Malcolm wanted was a candy bar,\\
297 - but Leland put a lock on the vending machine.\\
298 - We can't let him get away with this.\\
299 - I want to go on record: I hated him first.\\
300 - This would never happen in Barthelona.\\
301 - Why are Americans so immature?\\
302 - Why don't you just write an angry note\\
303 - or-or a missive after I get accepted?\\
304 - Look, Scott, you'll face jerks and tyrants\\
305 - like Leland all your life.\\
306 - The sooner you learn how to deal with them, the better.\\
307 - And no one's chances of getting into this school\\
308 - are going to be affected.\\
309 - He is going to hand over that key.\\
310 - How? I don't know yet,\\
311 - but there are plenty of ways\\
312 - to force people to do what you want.\\
313 - You can find something incriminating in their room.\\
314 - You can get dirt from a bitter ex,\\
315 - or you can make a blanket accusation\\
316 - with absolute conviction\\
317 - and just wait for them to blurt out something.\\
318 - Wait.\\
319 - You use that trick on me all the time.\\
320 - No, sweetie, that's a different thing entirely.\\
321 - We've gotta get Malcolm some candy.\\
322 - Well, I guess I'll be cool and popular after college.\\
323 - Dewey?\\
324 - Dad! In here!\\
325 - Quick! What is it?.\\
326 - I just saw someone sneak out with Mom's robe.\\
327 - Good eye, son.\\
328 - Halt!\\
329 - Halt, you damn punks!\\
330 - Everything is fine.\\
331 - Nothing in here\\
332 - but children enjoying themselves dancing\\
333 - and skipping like young lambs.\\
334 - Come again soon.\\
335 - Otto, it's Francis.\\
336 - I have the DVDs. Let me in.\\
337 - We have a slight problem.\\
338 - You know how I wanted everything\\
339 - to be special for the children.\\
340 - So I went to the store and I got those cookies\\
341 - and then I saw this old-fashioned hard lemonade,\\
342 - I bought three cases.\\
343 - Hard lemonade? That has alcohol in it.\\
344 - Yes, Francis, I said there was a problem.\\
345 - Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?\\
346 - I do. I do.\\
347 - Don't tell me to use my indoor voice.\\
348 - Why don't you use your indoor voice?.\\
349 - I'm not just saying it, man.\\
350 - We should totally have a play date.\\
351 - Oh, my God.\\
352 - These parents trusted me with their little ones\\
353 - und  I've poisoned them.\\
354 - What kind of a monster am I?\\
355 - Otto, you made an honest mistake,\\
356 - but everything's gonna be okay.\\
357 - As long as the kids are in here, they're safe.\\
358 - Oh!\\
359 - Well,\\
360 - it's a little early for Christmas carols, isn't it?\\
361 - Leland, I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier.\\
362 - Obviously, this job is very important to you.\\
363 - Who knows where you could find another\\
364 - that commands respect and power.\\
365 - You know, it would be such a shame\\
366 - if somehow you got fired and had to go back home\\
367 - where your older brother and sister\\
368 - get all the attention that you deserve.\\
369 - Do you really want to risk that for a 75-cent candy bar?\\
370 - You really have me pegged--\\
371 - Except for what you're forgetting is--\\
372 - the lower the stakes, the greater the thrill\\
373 - from the arbitrary exercise of power.\\
374 - If this were a one-cent candy bar, I'd be on the moon.\\
375 - I happen to be a control freak.\\
376 - If you get me fired, I'll just\\
377 - find some other job where I can be a control freak.\\
378 - Kinko's is looking for a night manager.\\
379 - Either way, I've already written\\
380 - negative-evaluation e-mails of these kids\\
381 - to the Office of Admissions.\\
382 - All I have to do is hit "Send."\\
383 - She overloaded a wall socket, too!\\
384 - We're just like the bulls in Pamplona.\\
385 - Now, you.\\
386 - Any freshman Psych major can see it's obvious\\
387 - life didn't pan out the way you thought it would,\\
388 - so now to make up for it, you have to run your kid's life.\\
389 - I don't know who to root for.\\
390 - The simple truth is,\\
391 - you're just too afraid to let go\\
392 - of the one thing in your life that may be a success.\\
393 - But, hey, you don't have to take my word for it.\\
394 - Why don't we just ask the other mothers here\\
395 - and see what  they  think?\\
396 - Oh, that's right.\\
397 - There  are  no other mothers here.\\
398 - You just cost this floor their electricity privileges.\\
399 - Mom?\\
400 - I can't do this.\\
401 - What?\\
402 - I wanted to help you, to take care\\
403 - of things for you, but you know what?\\
404 - I'm just not up to it.\\
405 - I think you should do this on your own.\\
406 - What?\\
407 - It's time for me to step aside\\
408 - and let you handle things.\\
409 - Malcolm, I know you can do this.\\
410 - Unless I missed the sarcasm, I think she meant that.\\
411 - I've actually been given permission to run my own life.\\
412 - Well, at least get my own candy bar.\\
413 - But you know what?\\
414 - I want that candy bar more than I want my next breath.\\
415 - I have a plan.\\
416 - Malcolm, what are you doing?\\
417 - My plan.\\
418 - Well, get your foot out of the door.\\
419 - It's stuck.\\
420 - By the way, our Madrigal group is having a sing-off\\
421 - against Jazzmatazz tomorrow.\\
422 - You should check it out before you leave.\\
423 - All right, Jamie,\\
424 - this'll put a stop to all the stealing.\\
425 - And your father is a reasonable man,\\
426 - but sometimes even he can be pushed too far.\\
427 - You don't poke the bear.\\
428 - Police! Nobody move!\\
429 - We have a warrant\\
430 - to search these premises\\
431 - on suspicion of possession of narcotics.\\
432 - Nice.\\
433 - Narcotics? What are you...\\
434 - Sir, we need you to just remain calm,\\
435 - and we'll get through this as quickly as possible.\\
436 - Weren't you Annie Oakley in the school play?\\
437 - Yeah, but I wasn't very good.\\
438 - My stuff!\\
439 -        \\
440 - Oh, my God.\\
441 - All this time, you were just using me to get to my dad?\\
442 - And all this time you were selling drugs,\\
443 - and you never even bought us a DVD player?\\
444 - Get him out of here.\\
445 - Hey, doctor man,\\
446 - it must be great saving people all day.\\
447 - What do I do?\\
448 - Play kickball.\\
449 - They're going to have\\
450 - some spectacular headaches,\\
451 - but, uh, otherwise they'll be fine.\\
452 - That is good news.\\
453 - Thank you for coming out here, Doctor.\\
454 - I don't say anything about this, you don't say anything\\
455 - about the keys I left in your gallbladder.\\
456 - Deal.\\
457 - So what are we going to do about the parents?\\
458 - Come on, honey, it's time to go back to the room\\
459 - with your wonderful, wonderful father.\\
460 - Thank you so much.\\
461 - You saved our marriage.\\
462 - I almost forgot she was a woman.\\
463 - Let's go, son.\\
464 - Whoa, Dad.\\
465 - You want to turn the volume down?\\
466 - It's not a total loss.\\
467 - When they took the door off the hinges,\\
468 - they discovered Leland had a hot plate.\\
469 - We all got to watch while they made him unplug it\\
470 - and put it in the closet.\\
471 - Don't you worry about it, honey.\\
472 - Just be glad this was our safety school.\\
473 - When we go to Yale, I promise I'll be\\
474 - much more on top of things.
\subsection {Episode 17: Polly in the Middle}
1 - What are you doing? Playing with ants.\\
2 - Looking for a little picnic, huh?\\
3 - Looks like you've come to the wrong place.\\
4 - There's one on your hand.\\
5 - Ha, ha...\\
6 - He's got a little surprise coming.\\
7 - Stupid ant.\\
8 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
9 -     I don't know    \\
10 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
11 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     And you're not so big    \\
15 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     And you're not so big    \\
19 -     Life is unfair.    \\
20 - Since Stevie's mom deserted him,\\
21 - he's been living a little more dangerously.\\
22 - Yesterday he read a book in dim light.\\
23 - Now he's making his first prank phone call.\\
24 - Hello...\\
25 - is your... refrigerator...\\
26 - Yeah... it's me.\\
27 - We have got to get tickets to this baseball card convention.\\
28 - You know who's going to be there?\\
29 - Reggie Jackson,\\
30 - Sammy Sosa, Barry Bonds and Pete Bucowski.\\
31 - Pete Bucowski!\\
32 - Who? Oh, for the...\\
33 - Only the first Polish-American lefty from the tri-county area\\
34 - to play two complete seasons in the majors.\\
35 - And you call yourselves fans.\\
36 - It's not in there either.\\
37 - I can't find my lucky shirt.\\
38 - Your what? My lucky shirt.\\
39 - The shirt that gives me good luck.\\
40 - I wear it and I'm lucky.\\
41 - Lucky shirt.\\
42 - You ever hear anything so stupid?\\
43 - You're asking me...\\
44 - about luck?\\
45 - Here it is! That's better.\\
46 - I don't know what I would've done\\
47 - without my lucky shirt.\\
48 - It's not a lucky shirt.\\
49 - Hey, look.\\
50 - An M&M.\\
51 - Here you go, Abe.\\
52 - Thank you so much\\
53 - for helping us bachelors with our laundry, Lois.\\
54 - Wow, the collars are so crisp.\\
55 - That's her signature.\\
56 - Oh, honestly.\\
57 - It's just a little spray starch and a firm hand.\\
58 - So, Abe, how's the divorce going?\\
59 - It's a nightmare, Hal.\\
60 - Kitty is out of control.\\
61 - She wears these outrageous miniskirts to court,\\
62 - flirts with the judge...\\
63 - What did your lawyer do?\\
64 - He asked me if she could sit at our table.\\
65 - Whoa.\\
66 - You know, Abe, it's been a while.\\
67 - Maybe you should think about getting out there again.\\
68 - Oh, I've taken care of that.\\
69 - I've decided to spend the rest of my life\\
70 - in misery and die alone.\\
71 - Sorry, I was driving home and knew I wouldn't make it.\\
72 - This was the nearest safe house.\\
73 - Hot soup!\\
74 - I'm taking Jamie to the park.\\
75 - We're going to look for butterflies\\
76 - and talk about his birth trauma.\\
77 - Sounds good.\\
78 - Oh, Polly, this is Abe.\\
79 - Hi.\\
80 - Hi.\\
81 - Oh, my God.\\
82 - That woman fell out of the sexy tree\\
83 - and hit every branch\\
84 - on the way down.\\
85 - Abe, you dog.\\
86 - Why don't you ask her out?\\
87 - Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't.\\
88 - To be honest, I didn't even ask Kitty out.\\
89 - My dad asked her dad, and we gave her family a ham.\\
90 - But maybe you could ask her for me.\\
91 - No. I don't do that anymore.\\
92 - My setups have a way of not working out.\\
93 - You just told me I should get out there\\
94 - and now you're crushing my dreams.\\
95 - Abe, you read about the guy who woke up\\
96 - in a tub full of ice with his kidney gone?\\
97 - One of my setups.\\
98 - And I had a really good feeling about that one.\\
99 - Please. I need this.\\
100 - Oh, all right.\\
101 - But I'm warning you,\\
102 - I have a really good feeling about this one, too.\\
103 - Halftime.\\
104 - Nighty-night.\\
105 - Oh, if Jamie has that dream again--\\
106 - I think it's about a bad teddy--\\
107 - try and get him to ride it out.\\
108 - He's got to defeat that thing.\\
109 - Got it.\\
110 - Oh, listen, Polly,\\
111 - are you doing anything Friday night?\\
112 - Oh, my God, I've been dreading this day.\\
113 - This is what happened on my last job.\\
114 - Of course he told me he only had six months to live.\\
115 - And, boy, did he live.\\
116 - No. No, no.\\
117 - Polly, Polly...\\
118 - I was asking for my friend, Abe.\\
119 - He was here the other day.\\
120 - Oh. Stevie's dad?\\
121 - Yeah. Oh, he's a great guy.\\
122 - A lot of fun, a big heart, a great personality...\\
123 - I know he's fat, Hal.\\
124 - That wasn't... Oh, no, that's okay.\\
125 - To tell you the truth, I prefer big men.\\
126 - So have him call me.\\
127 - All right!\\
128 - But this should not be construed\\
129 - as a setup in any way,\\
130 - because he was going to ask you out in the first place.\\
131 - If you're gonna do this, you need to promise in advance\\
132 - that you're not going to stalk him\\
133 - or run him over with a car\\
134 - or suddenly decide\\
135 - he looks like your stepbrother\\
136 - and throw a steam iron at him.\\
137 - I drifted off, Hal, but okay.\\
138 - And after the movie we took off our shoes\\
139 - and walked barefoot through the mall.\\
140 - I tell you, Hal, I feel like a new man.\\
141 - Yesterday I was watching\\
142 - a Pepe LePew cartoon and I thought,\\
143 - "So he doesn't get the cat. Is that anything to cry over?"\\
144 - Wow. That is a real breakthrough, Abe.\\
145 - I'm definitely going to see her again.\\
146 - Well, she's here tomorrow. I'll ask her...\\
147 - No, no, I already asked her out. Myself.\\
148 - It was amazing.\\
149 - I was like some magnificent beast.\\
150 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
151 - I'm going to add my own fabric softener.\\
152 - Francis, look at this Visa bill.\\
153 - What did we say about expenditures over $100?\\
154 - I needed a new hat.\\
155 - Give me your card.\\
156 - Piama, this is stupid.\\
157 - Give me your card.\\
158 - Thanks for letting me\\
159 - get ready here, Lois.\\
160 - Which earrings?\\
161 - Well, the dangly are a little...\\
162 - Oh, I was asking Jamie.\\
163 - I'm sorry, but he's really good at this.\\
164 - Oh, you're right. What was I thinking?\\
165 - I'm so nervous.\\
166 - This is the third date, and you know what that means.\\
167 - Well, Polly...\\
168 - Oh, no. Not that.\\
169 - I get that out of the way on the first date.\\
170 - Makes everyone more relaxed.\\
171 - No, tonight we're going to do tribal scarring\\
172 - and then go to Ben and Jerry's.\\
173 - Well, it may not be our idea of romance,\\
174 - but those two have really hit it off.\\
175 - And here I was convinced setting people up\\
176 - was a recipe for disaster.\\
177 - I was skeptical, too, but you know what?\\
178 - I was wrong, and I'm happy to admit it.\\
179 - Hold on, lover boy.\\
180 - She's not quite...\\
181 - Craig? Hi.\\
182 - Is Polly ready?\\
183 - Hi, Craig. She'll be out in a minute.\\
184 - Don't you look nice?\\
185 - Thanks. I set my Flowbee on "hot."\\
186 - Hi. Hi.\\
187 - Mm, what is that intoxicating fragrance?\\
188 - Oh, it's Glade.\\
189 - It suits you.\\
190 - Have fun, you two.\\
191 - That's not Abe.\\
192 - No, that's Craig. What about it?\\
193 - She can't be dating Craig. She's dating Abe.\\
194 - What are you talking about?\\
195 - I set up Abe and Polly.\\
196 - I set up Craig and Polly.\\
197 - All the time we've been talking about Polly's date,\\
198 - we've been talking about two different people?\\
199 - I haven't been.\\
200 - I clearly remember saying,\\
201 - "Overweight, nearsighted, lonely,\\
202 - lost his kitty..."\\
203 - Oh, my God.\\
204 - I picked up some cold medicine for you.\\
205 - I told you I'm fine.\\
206 - You know what happens when you get that scratchy thing in your throat.\\
207 - I don't need it.\\
208 - I'm not gonna be up all night with you coughing.\\
209 - Just take it.\\
210 - Se  ora.\\
211 - Se  ora.\\
212 - You have to stop telling me what to do.\\
213 - You are putting me in a horrible position\\
214 - in front of my guys, Piama, and it's getting worse.\\
215 - They're not doing the work?\\
216 - What? No, they do plenty of work.\\
217 - Then what's the problem?\\
218 - They're... teasing me.\\
219 - The other boys are teasing you.\\
220 - Let me explain something to you, Piama.\\
221 - The whole macho thing is very big in Mexican culture.\\
222 - No, it's actually big in every culture,\\
223 - and I'm not buying into it\\
224 - just because these guys are acting like jerks.\\
225 - That's a good boy.\\
226 - I will not be mocked.\\
227 - Do you hear me?!\\
228 - I'm not kidding!\\
229 - I'm sorry.\\
230 - Clean socks.\\
231 - Yes! Lucky shirt strikes again.\\
232 - It's not a lucky shirt.\\
233 - You shouldn't criticize things\\
234 - you're not equipped to understand, Malcolm.\\
235 - It's a shirt. It's just fabric.\\
236 - There's nothing in there but atoms.\\
237 - Luck atoms.\\
238 - There are no luck atoms.\\
239 - Everyone has some kind of luck, Malcolm.\\
240 - Like you, you're lucky at taking tests.\\
241 - I bust my ass to get good grades.\\
242 - Why does my lucky shirt make you so mad?\\
243 - Because believing in that kind of nonsense\\
244 - isn't smart or healthy or good for society.\\
245 - The world doesn't work by magic or superstition.\\
246 - It's rational.\\
247 - Maybe you believe that because all you're good at is thinking,\\
248 - and if the world isn't logical\\
249 - then you're lost.\\
250 - Okay, fine. You know what, Dewey, luck this.\\
251 - This... proves nothing.\\
252 - I can't believe she's seeing someone else.\\
253 - She just came right out and said it\\
254 - like it was no big deal.\\
255 - Said she didn't want to be chained down.\\
256 - Chained down. Can you believe it?\\
257 - Yeah, I can.\\
258 - But then I've had some time to process it, Abe.\\
259 - You told me twice last night and the day before that\\
260 - when you showed up at work.\\
261 - I sense his presence, Hal.\\
262 - His essence lingering.\\
263 - Picture it, Hal.\\
264 - I want you to picture it.\\
265 - Her lips on another man's lips.\\
266 - Not mine.\\
267 - What's wrong with my lips?\\
268 - I wish I knew who it was.\\
269 - If I ever find out who it is\\
270 - I will track him down to his evil lair and... and...\\
271 - I'll probably just take a lot of telephoto shots\\
272 - and start dressing like him.\\
273 - You have to have some clue to his identity.\\
274 - Think, Lois, think!\\
275 - Craig, you're driving me crazy.\\
276 - I'm sorry. You're right.\\
277 - Absolutely right.\\
278 - Is he rich?\\
279 - Famous? Athletic?\\
280 - Muscular? Intellectual? Slim?\\
281 - Is he lit from within\\
282 - by a quiet, inner strength and steely resolve?\\
283 - It's so unfair.\\
284 - Why does he have to have my woman?\\
285 - Oh, God...\\
286 - it's not that hunk from the calendar\\
287 - holding the tires, is it?\\
288 - I can't compete with that.\\
289 - How can I compete with that?\\
290 - Sure, I've got my joke book,\\
291 - but that really only takes me so far.\\
292 - Why would God give me a glimpse of paradise\\
293 - just to slam the gate in my face?\\
294 - God hates me.\\
295 - - I'm so unhappy. - I'm so unhappy.\\
296 - You have to choose, Polly.\\
297 - I can't.\\
298 - I keep trying, but it just isn't easy.\\
299 - Honestly, Lois, as a woman,\\
300 - could you choose between Craig and Abe?\\
301 - Well, um, thankfully,\\
302 - I don't have to make such a difficult decision.\\
303 - But the important thing is, Polly,\\
304 - you do.\\
305 - But it's impossible.\\
306 - Every time I try and weigh their strengths and attractions,\\
307 - they come out even.\\
308 - Craig has that sexy self-confidence\\
309 - and love of fantasy play,\\
310 - and Abe is warm and kind and he gets one extra point\\
311 - because he's black.\\
312 - He just does. There, I've said it.\\
313 - Plus this is all complicated by the fact\\
314 - that I am having the most exciting time of my life\\
315 - and never want it to end.\\
316 - But, Polly...\\
317 - I'm sorry. I have to go.\\
318 - I'm meeting Craig for Laser Tag\\
319 - and then Abe at the Cheesecake Factory.\\
320 - You know, if society weren't so hung up,\\
321 - we'd have the solution.\\
322 - Okay, we're just going to have\\
323 - to help make the decision for her.\\
324 - You're right.\\
325 - Can you get Abe to back off?\\
326 - What? Why Abe?\\
327 - Why can't you get Craig to back off?\\
328 - Craig will fall apart. Abe can take it.\\
329 - He's more mature.\\
330 - The man sleeps with a night-light, Lois!\\
331 - Eight hours, Hal!\\
332 - For eight hours I had to watch Craig practice revenge faces.\\
333 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, this is crazy.\\
334 - We shouldn't be fighting.\\
335 - We should just stay out of this whole thing.\\
336 - You're right. You're right.\\
337 - They're both our friends.\\
338 - One of them will screw up eventually.\\
339 - Exactly.\\
340 - I just wish I could stop picturing the sex.\\
341 - Pete Bucowski never got discouraged, even when\\
342 - he got sent down to the minors for the fifth time. Let's go over there.\\
343 - He just shrugged and grinned that grin he had and said,\\
344 - "Hey, what the hey."\\
345 - It was like his catchphrase.\\
346 - Look, goose bumps.\\
347 - Great, Mom.\\
348 - We're gonna find Reggie Jackson.\\
349 - Okay, but don't miss Pete Bucowski.\\
350 - He's only appearing at 11:30, 12:15, 1:00,\\
351 - 2:30, 3:15, 4:30 and 6:00!\\
352 - Thanks so much for inviting me.\\
353 - I really needed something\\
354 - to take my mind off of my love life.\\
355 - Well, that's why God invented baseball.\\
356 - And war.\\
357 - Look, Pete will come to your birthday party.\\
358 - Be sure to turn in your ticket stubs to be eligible\\
359 - for a chance to win Reggie Jackson's\\
360 - 450th home run ball.\\
361 - I thought they said I'd be roped off.\\
362 - I won't let you touch the ball,\\
363 - but I will let you touch my hand after my hand has touched the ball.\\
364 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
365 - You know what? If you win,\\
366 - I will kiss Reese's butt on that stage.\\
367 - Deal. Shake. No take-backs.\\
368 - Fine.\\
369 - Any rituals you go through before a big game?\\
370 - Come on. You can talk to me.\\
371 - What? Does it violate\\
372 - your precious chicken code?\\
373 - Hal, come on.\\
374 - Guy gets too big to talk to the fans who made him!\\
375 - Hal?\\
376 - Lois?\\
377 - Polly?\\
378 - What an incredible coinky-dink.\\
379 - Hi, Craig.\\
380 - Hi, Craig.\\
381 - Hey, Polly, we'll take Jamie for a while\\
382 - if you two want to spend some time together.\\
383 - Mm...\\
384 - We had an agreement.\\
385 - How dare you, Lois!\\
386 - Polly,\\
387 - what an unbelievable surprise.\\
388 - Think how humiliated Abe--\\
389 - who coincidentally just arrived--\\
390 - is going to feel.\\
391 - Hi, Abe.\\
392 - Hi.\\
393 - Well, well, well. Well.\\
394 - Polly, you remember my crippled son Stevie who lost his mother?\\
395 - I'm... needy.\\
396 - Hey, Abe, Stevie.\\
397 - Craig, nice to see you.\\
398 - My golly, isn't this gut-wrenching?\\
399 - Polly, are you okay?\\
400 - Fine. I just seem to be having\\
401 - an out-of-body experience\\
402 - which my shaman would be very proud of,\\
403 - except I think I'm going to be falling down now.\\
404 - Oh. I got you, baby.\\
405 - Daddy's here, angel.\\
406 - You! You!\\
407 - Boys, please, please.\\
408 - Now, every conflict invites a dark angel\\
409 - and an angel of light.\\
410 - So let's summon an angel of light!\\
411 - I've waited for this moment.\\
412 - Not as much as I have.\\
413 - How do you know how much I have?\\
414 - Abe, come on.\\
415 - No, Hal.\\
416 - He's made a fool of me for the last time!\\
417 - Craig, don't do this!\\
418 - I will not stand by and let him put the horns on me, Lois.\\
419 - Oh, my God, they're killing each other!\\
420 - Oh! Ow! Oh!\\
421 - Ow!\\
422 - Get him... Dad!\\
423 - Slap him... silly.\\
424 - Had enough, Feldspar?!\\
425 - I haven't begun to have enough!\\
426 - To... have had enough. Time-out!\\
427 - Time-out!\\
428 - Time-in!\\
429 - Here's your tuna sandwich that you wanted.\\
430 - Thanks.\\
431 - I just hope I got it for you fast enough.\\
432 - Because I know when my man gets hungry,\\
433 - he wants to eat right away.\\
434 - And that's my job,\\
435 - to make my man happy.\\
436 - Well... I hope so, too.\\
437 - And let's just hope\\
438 - this isn't a repeat of the last time.\\
439 - I mean, let's face it.\\
440 - That sandwich was a joke.\\
441 - Let's not turn a favor into something that you'll regret.\\
442 - As a matter of fact, I think I would prefer this toasted.\\
443 - And I'd like to see a little garnish this time!\\
444 - And I'd like you to think about a certain special thing\\
445 - that you love that's never gonna happen again.\\
446 - No, honey, wait! I'm sorry!\\
447 - Hey, Reg,\\
448 - Pete Bucowski, the Polish Splinter.\\
449 - Oh, God, I hate these things.\\
450 - All the fans want a piece of you.\\
451 - Always getting mobbed.\\
452 - Yeah, yeah. What do you want me to sign?\\
453 - Just this ball.\\
454 - And the 12 shirts in this box.\\
455 - Anything you want me to sign?\\
456 - Okay, the Reggie Jackson home run ball\\
457 - will be raffled off in one minute.\\
458 - I think I'll put it on the mantle.\\
459 - Right after Malcolm plants one on my butt.\\
460 - It's a stupid bet.\\
461 - Yeah, but if he wins, you're doing it.\\
462 - Your brother bet you he'd win the ball?\\
463 - He thinks he has a lucky shirt.\\
464 - Lucky shirt.\\
465 - When I was in Little League,\\
466 - I had a pair of smelly old lucky socks\\
467 - that I wore all summer.\\
468 - Pretty dumb, huh?\\
469 - Yeah.\\
470 - I hit .475\\
471 - with 50 home runs that season.\\
472 - Don't let him welsh, kid.\\
473 - I won't, Reggie.\\
474 - When Dewey wins,\\
475 - you pucker up and I will, too.\\
476 -        \\
477 - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.\\
478 - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.\\
479 - Stop this!\\
480 - Then you have to choose!\\
481 - Yeah, choose!\\
482 - Abe or me!\\
483 - The dumpy loser or the one who loves you?!\\
484 - I'm the one who loves you.\\
485 - Don't fall for his smooth line!\\
486 - I love you more!\\
487 - Okay, okay, okay. I choose... Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.\\
488 - Jamie.\\
489 - I'm sorry, but my career's what's important to me.\\
490 - You guys have been a distraction.\\
491 - An unbelievable carnal delight...\\
492 - but a distraction nonetheless.\\
493 - Baby-sitting is the only thing I'm really good at.\\
494 - Uh, where's the baby?\\
495 - Oh, my God! Jamie!\\
496 - And the winner is...\\
497 - Give me that!\\
498 - You're not getting out of kissing my butt!\\
499 - Give me back my lucky shirt!\\
500 - It's not a lucky shirt!\\
501 - Shut up, Dewey.\\
502 - Oh, my God!\\
503 - Pete Bucowski saved my baby!\\
504 - Glad I could help, ma'am.\\
505 - Want to buy an autographed Reggie Jackson shirt?\\
506 - It isn't the jacket that smells.\\
507 - There was a fried apple pie in the pocket.\\
508 - Thanks, Lois.\\
509 - So where are you players headed tonight?\\
510 - The Rusty Scupper.\\
511 - Uh-oh, we better get a wiggle on, Craig.\\
512 - Happy Hour starts in 20 minutes\\
513 - and the ladies won't wait.\\
514 - They'll wait for you in those new chinos.\\
515 - I won't have a chance with you in your leather jacket.\\
516 - Not if they get a load of your...\\
517 - Ah, ah, ah. Come on.\\
518 - How are you going to get on the scene?\\
519 - Like a sex machine.
\subsection {Episode 18: Experiment}
1 - Distinguished guests, friends,\\
2 - members of the press...\\
3 - when the Fish Defense League told me\\
4 - that the dam on our property\\
5 - was blocking the endangered silverback trout\\
6 - from its natural breeding grounds, I was glad to help.\\
7 - And so today,\\
8 - we are going to blow up this evil dam.\\
9 - Afterwards, we will have a nice, light lunch\\
10 - provided by the Grotto,\\
11 - a friend of fish and the business traveler.\\
12 - Here we go!\\
13 - That's weird.\\
14 - From here, the dynamite looks\\
15 - a lot like a picnic cooler.\\
16 - I am starting to think\\
17 - that that is a picnic cooler.\\
18 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
19 -     I don't know    \\
20 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
21 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
22 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
23 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
24 -     And you're not so big    \\
25 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
26 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
27 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
28 -     And you're not so big    \\
29 -     Life is unfair.    \\
30 - We'd like to wish a happy birthday\\
31 - to Mary who is six years old.\\
32 - Mom and Dad let Dewey pick where we went to dinner tonight.\\
33 - I can't decide if it's\\
34 - supposed to be a punishment for us\\
35 - or a treat for him.\\
36 - Probably a little bit of both.\\
37 - How's the chicken supposed to know you like her\\
38 - if you don't say anything?\\
39 - Boys! Food's here!\\
40 - So, Dewey, are you having a good time?\\
41 - I actually am.\\
42 - Oh, wait.\\
43 - Why?\\
44 - He's dying!\\
45 - We have to make sure you come up with a really good wish.\\
46 - Reese, he isn't dying.\\
47 - If he were dying, we'd at least spring for Red Lobster.\\
48 - Mrs. Welsh, your counselor,\\
49 - said that she'd like you to take an I.Q. test.\\
50 - What?! Malcolm, do not poison your brother.\\
51 - He is an entirely different person than you are and\\
52 - he is not automatically going to have the same experience!\\
53 - It's just a little test, honey.\\
54 - Mom, don't do this.\\
55 - I lost all my friends\\
56 - when I went into the Krelboyne class.\\
57 - Everyone hated us!\\
58 - You had every advantage in that class.\\
59 - You had computers,\\
60 - an electron microscope, a seismograph...\\
61 - Which is why they hated us!\\
62 - Malcolm, we all know there's something weird\\
63 - going on in that boy's brain and I, for one...\\
64 -     Fun feet dance    \\
65 -     To the happy groove time!    \\
66 - What the...?\\
67 -        \\
68 - Excuse me.\\
69 - Craig? Oh, hi, Hal.\\
70 - What're you doing?\\
71 - Just protecting my high score.\\
72 - It's cheaper than a gym.\\
73 - And no shower bullies.\\
74 - You're great.\\
75 - Well, I'm kind of a legend around here.\\
76 - You're staying out of the ball pit, right, Feldspar?\\
77 - Yes, sir. You were quite clear on that.\\
78 - Hey, hop on up, Hal. It's a blast.\\
79 - Beat it, Davey.\\
80 - Oh, I don't know...\\
81 - Come on. It's easy. Just watch the screen,\\
82 - put your feet where it says.\\
83 - Let's try it.\\
84 -        \\
85 - Hey, this is fun.\\
86 - Really fun!\\
87 - Oh, God.\\
88 - Just got him\\
89 - to stop the ice sculpting.\\
90 - Well, it looks like it's going to be just you and me\\
91 - for the next month, sweetie.\\
92 - So the school thinks I might be a genius, too?\\
93 - But I'm not a whiny loudmouth\\
94 - who complains about everything.\\
95 - Malcolm's a genius, and now Dewey's a genius?\\
96 - I guess it's only a matter of time\\
97 - 'till we find out that I'm a genius.\\
98 - I wonder what kind of genius I am.\\
99 - 15 times 32 is 3,989.\\
100 - It's 480.\\
101 - Okay, so I'm not Rain Man, big deal.\\
102 - Some day they'll invent a machine\\
103 - that does that stuff for you, anyway.\\
104 - Okay, question 17 was,\\
105 - "Bee is to hive as A) fish is to pond,\\
106 - "B) bear is to den\\
107 - or C) coral is to reef?"\\
108 - That's what it was, right?\\
109 - How should... I know?\\
110 - You took the same test I did.\\
111 - Four... years ago.\\
112 - How do you... remember?\\
113 - I just do.\\
114 - And it's a good thing, because it's the only way\\
115 - we can keep Dewey out of the Krelboyne class.\\
116 - Why can't... he just... tank it?\\
117 - The tests are designed to catch that.\\
118 - We have to give exactly the same answers\\
119 - a real dumb person would give.\\
120 - How do we... do that?\\
121 - Guys, guys! I've been trying to figure out\\
122 - what kind of genius I am,\\
123 - and I finally realized, I should go to the library!\\
124 - And you know what?\\
125 - You can get Internet porn there\\
126 - and the librarians can't do anything about it!\\
127 - God, I love\\
128 - this country. Hey, Mom!\\
129 -        \\
130 - I'm doing it!\\
131 - And it only took all my lunch breaks\\
132 - and $200 worth of quarters!\\
133 - Can't one of you\\
134 - have a heart attack so the rest of us can play?\\
135 - In a second.\\
136 - Show time!\\
137 - Yes!\\
138 - I think we're finally ready.\\
139 - I didn't want to say anything until I was sure,\\
140 - but I signed us up for the weekly tournament.\\
141 - No, it's too soon.\\
142 - Hal, you don't work this hard\\
143 - just to Jump, Jump Dance alone in your room.\\
144 - Besides, someone has to teach Hayley and Kylie\\
145 - not to be so stuck up just because they think they're so great.\\
146 - You can't enter the tournament.\\
147 - You're going to look like idiots.\\
148 - We're not done rehearsing.\\
149 - We'll be a lot better by then.\\
150 - No, you're going to look like idiots\\
151 - because it's a contest for kids.\\
152 - It doesn't say that anywhere.\\
153 - I read the rules three times.\\
154 - And we're under the weight limit.\\
155 - You can call the manufacturer.\\
156 - If you give these answers\\
157 - exactly the way they're written,\\
158 - you'll stay out of the Krelboyne class.\\
159 - Maybe I'd like the Krelboyne class.\\
160 - I hear they just got a robot parrot\\
161 - that speaks 20 languages.\\
162 - Dewey, you have to trust me.\\
163 - I'm the good brother.\\
164 - I'm the one who cares about you.\\
165 - You beat me up and make fun of me.\\
166 - Only when you're being annoying.\\
167 - Dewey, I'm serious.\\
168 - How can I make you understand?\\
169 - The coolest person in the class... was me.\\
170 - Okay, I'll do it.\\
171 - You're sure... this'll work?\\
172 - Hey, if there's one thing I know,\\
173 - Reese's answers will not get him into the Krelboyne class.\\
174 - I'm emotionally disturbed?!\\
175 - Oh, we don't use those terms.\\
176 - This isn't about labeling.\\
177 - A blue folder with an asterisk next to your name\\
178 - just means that you get a little more special help than other kids.\\
179 - Hey, Bill.\\
180 - This one's named Dewey.\\
181 - Dewey, Dewey, Dewey.\\
182 - Okay.\\
183 - There's no yelling, no kicking,\\
184 - no hitting, no physical touching of any kind.\\
185 - You are allowed to cry, if you do it quietly.\\
186 - Find a seat wherever you can.\\
187 - Vroom, vroom.\\
188 - Hey, could you scratch my nose?\\
189 - What's that?\\
190 - Oh.\\
191 - You can ignore the sign.\\
192 - They put you in with the Buseys?!\\
193 - Yeah, it's real interesting.\\
194 - Today, we learned about our greatest enemies,\\
195 - Mr. Matches and Mr. Talk-Out-Of-Turn.\\
196 - Oh, and I also got to see a crane\\
197 - lower a flight simulator into the Krelboyne class.\\
198 - Oh, my God! Does Mom know?\\
199 - You're still alive, so no.\\
200 - I'm so sorry. I swear I'll fix this.\\
201 - Just don't tell Mom.\\
202 - Please, please don't tell Mom.\\
203 - You know, I like the begging, but it needs something.\\
204 - Better, but... still not enough.\\
205 - Dewey, this is my paycheck.\\
206 - There's $98.00 here.\\
207 - I will give you everything I make\\
208 - until you get out of that class.\\
209 - Hi, boys. Hey.\\
210 - Oh, Dewey, did Mrs. Welsh tell you\\
211 - when they'd get your test results?\\
212 - Oh, I got 'em.\\
213 - And he's in the Krelboyne class,\\
214 - just like you wanted.\\
215 - I hope you're happy.\\
216 - You've ruined his life!\\
217 - Come on, Dewey.\\
218 - Well, I'm not an escape artist.\\
219 - Okay. Now that Chad has apologized\\
220 - to Lester, Max, Zoe, Phoebe, Garth, Michelle,\\
221 - and Linda,\\
222 - we can now try, once again,\\
223 - to read  Polar Express\\
224 - in as normal a way as we can possibly manage.\\
225 - Hanson?\\
226 - Indoor muffler!\\
227 - Okay, I want you to open this book\\
228 - to page seven and read.\\
229 - No motorcycle.\\
230 - Just say exactly what's on the page.\\
231 - No motorcycle.\\
232 - No motorcycle.\\
233 - No motorcycle.\\
234 - No motorcycle.\\
235 - Okay, okay. That's enough reading.\\
236 - Why don't we try some more quiet time?\\
237 - Why did you do that?\\
238 - When did you read that book?\\
239 - Three years ago.\\
240 - Me, too. All of us did.\\
241 - They treat us like we're stupid instead of just weird.\\
242 - This place is slowly killing me.\\
243 - Oh, look. We made it to recess.\\
244 - Jeffy, you're not an arm's length from Carrie.\\
245 - Why don't we have recess with the other kids?\\
246 - We make them too sad.\\
247 -        \\
248 -        \\
249 - Mrs. Welsh? May I help you?\\
250 - I'm Malcolm, Dewey's brother.\\
251 - I have to talk to you about the test Dewey took.\\
252 - I'm afraid I can only discuss that with his parents.\\
253 - See, that's just it.\\
254 - I can get in a lot of trouble for coming here,\\
255 - but I have to tell you why his test came out the way it did.\\
256 - Our mom has a substance abuse problem,\\
257 - and she had a huge relapse the morning he took the test.\\
258 - Oh, my God.\\
259 - Yeah, which is why she can't find out I came here.\\
260 - I don't want to say she's dangerous\\
261 - because she's, you know, my mom, and I love her.\\
262 - Wow. Well, I can tell you really care about your family.\\
263 - It's been really hard.\\
264 - Let's see what I can do. Okay?\\
265 - And I don't think we have to bother your mom with this.\\
266 - Thanks.\\
267 - I'll do everything through your dad.\\
268 - Thanks for the heads up.\\
269 - Wow. Ten messages from Dewey's counselor.\\
270 - Maybe I should...\\
271 - Practice so we can win this thing?\\
272 - Right.\\
273 - Five, six, seven, eight!\\
274 - One, two, three, and four\\
275 - and boogie shake, boogie shake,\\
276 - and slide and slide,\\
277 - These jazz shoes have really helped my kick turns.\\
278 - Totally worth 150 bucks.\\
279 - Hal?\\
280 - Uh-oh. Here comes Yoko.\\
281 - It's 5:00 in the morning.\\
282 - You've been up all night.\\
283 - Honey, I know you think this is silly\\
284 - and that I've just gone off the deep end again,\\
285 - but this isn't like the other times.\\
286 - I have a gift, Lois,\\
287 - and it would be wrong for me to turn my back on that.\\
288 - Right. I see we've entered phase two.\\
289 - Which is fine, as long as you follow the rules.\\
290 - You have to go to work.\\
291 - You have to eat.\\
292 - You cannot involve the children.\\
293 - And you're freezing the joint account.\\
294 - Did it last week.\\
295 - Good night, Fred. Ginger.\\
296 - I thought it was Fred and Barney.\\
297 - Take your tissue and carefully twist it to make a flower.\\
298 - Then you make a bouquet\\
299 - by carefully stacking them.\\
300 - Go slow. This isn't a race.\\
301 - Why do all our art projects use tissues?\\
302 - Because tissues are soft and nontoxic.\\
303 - This way no one gets hurt, and no one sues the school.\\
304 - This program can't handle another lawsuit, Dewey.\\
305 - I only get paid for four days a week as it is.\\
306 - But it's ridiculous.\\
307 - We have to do math without pencils.\\
308 - We have to do history without hard-cover books.\\
309 - Can't we at least have some art supplies?\\
310 - Art supplies mean scissors. Theymean paste.\\
311 - These children stab with scissors.\\
312 - They eat paste.\\
313 - Some of them tried to eat scissors.\\
314 - This one tried to stab with paste.\\
315 - Teachers are supposed to help their students.\\
316 - Maybe you wouldn't be so unhappy all the time\\
317 - if you tried a little harder.\\
318 - Look, Dewey, you're not going to make it\\
319 - through the year with that attitude.\\
320 - You just have to take all your hopes and dreams\\
321 - and let them die.\\
322 - Then maybe you won't end up staring at a clock\\
323 - at 4:00 in the morning wishing you had kissed more ass\\
324 - in grad school.\\
325 - Thanks for trying.\\
326 - I swear, if you can get the paste,\\
327 - I'll stab him for you.\\
328 - ...and then he was chopped up and eaten by wolves,\\
329 - because that's what happens to babies who pull hair.\\
330 - What are you doing here?\\
331 - Malcolm, who is it? Don't worry.\\
332 - I have a master's degree in conflict resolution.\\
333 - Can I help you? I'm Mrs. Welsh, Dewey's counselor.\\
334 - First of all, let me just tell you\\
335 - how much I admire your courage.\\
336 - Thank you.\\
337 - Your son Malcolm came to see me...\\
338 - No, I didn't!\\
339 - Let me do what I do.\\
340 - He was worried that Dewey\\
341 - had been placed in the wrong class.\\
342 - Malcolm, how dare you?\\
343 - You made your feelings very clear,\\
344 - but you had no right to do something like that!\\
345 - Well, the thing is I did look through Dewey's records,\\
346 - and his test results don't match up\\
347 - with his classroom performance.\\
348 - There may be grounds to retest him.\\
349 - Oh, no. Absolutely not!\\
350 - You are not going to take this away from my son.\\
351 - He deserves to be in that class.\\
352 - He needs to be in that class.\\
353 - And don't think I won't fight you on this.\\
354 - I didn't come here to upset you.\\
355 - The last thing that anyone wants is for you\\
356 - to feel out of control.\\
357 - Oh, you'll see out of control\\
358 - if you don't leave Dewey where he belongs.\\
359 - Believe me, you don't want to mess with this family.\\
360 - Well, maybe we'll talk about it in a month or so\\
361 - when you're feeling stronger.\\
362 - I'll work around any of your meetings.\\
363 - I can't believe the way that woman talked to you!\\
364 - I mean, sure, I unsuccessfully tried to keep Dewey out\\
365 - of the Krelboyne class,\\
366 - but she had no right to do that!\\
367 - Ah, put a cork in it.\\
368 - And don't think you're not in trouble\\
369 - just because your little plan didn't work.\\
370 -        \\
371 - Oh, that was just great. Which kids are yours?\\
372 - Those two.\\
373 - You guys are totally going to be my new save screen.\\
374 - Don't let it get to you, Hal.\\
375 - Soon, they're going to feel as stupid\\
376 - as they think we look.\\
377 - Let's rock. Yeah.\\
378 - Hey, I thought we're supposed\\
379 - to have the same costume.\\
380 - They're almost the same.\\
381 - Whoa!\\
382 - Ow! Ow!\\
383 - My ankle's twisted.\\
384 - Once again, I fly too close to the sun.\\
385 - But we have to dance.\\
386 - I can't, Hal. But you have to go on.\\
387 - We've worked too long and too hard to stop now.\\
388 - Go out there and win that coupon for two free medium pizzas\\
389 - for both of us.\\
390 - I know we've had our disagreements over the amount\\
391 - of time I spent doing this,\\
392 - but I don't think there's anyone else\\
393 - I could do this with.\\
394 - What do you say?\\
395 - Oh, Hal...\\
396 - I get the pizzas.\\
397 - Okay.\\
398 - Much applause\\
399 - to your sparkling feet!\\
400 -        \\
401 - Here comes the pencil turn. I can't watch.\\
402 - On any other man that would look ridiculous.\\
403 - We've lost him, Lois.\\
404 - He belongs to everyone now.\\
405 - Mr. Sheridan, why do motorcycles sound different\\
406 - when they're coming than when they're going away?\\
407 - Hanson, I'm trying to eat my lunch.\\
408 - By the time I explained it to you,\\
409 - you would have forgotten the question anyway.\\
410 - I think my brother Malcolm told me about that last summer.\\
411 - "It's called the Doppler Effect, Dewey.\\
412 - "Both sound and light travel at a constant speed,\\
413 - "but their wavelengths get shorter or longer\\
414 - "depending on whether they're moving towards you\\
415 - "or away from you.\\
416 - Now put some pants on, you little freak."\\
417 - My imaginary friends are right!\\
418 - I  am  a genius!\\
419 - So basically, what it means\\
420 - is that the sound waves\\
421 - from a motorcycle move away\\
422 - from it at the same speed in all directions.\\
423 - But if it's coming towards you,\\
424 - then the sound waves get stacked closer\\
425 - and closer together,\\
426 - so the frequency goes up and the sound gets higher.\\
427 - Do you understand?\\
428 - Yeah, I do.\\
429 - Oh, my God!\\
430 - I learned something.\\
431 - I learned something!\\
432 - I learned something! I learned something!\\
433 - I learned something! Hanson...\\
434 - I learned something!\\
435 - Maybe you shouldn't learn things\\
436 - if you're going to be so disruptive.\\
437 - Now sit down and be quiet.\\
438 - Everyone who hates this, follow me.\\
439 - What are you doing?\\
440 -        \\
441 - Please, children, calm down!\\
442 - Remember, quiet minds are happy minds!\\
443 - Let's say it together!\\
444 - Quiet minds are happy minds!\\
445 - Quiet minds are...\\
446 - I'm so glad that contest is finally behind you.\\
447 - Yeah.\\
448 - You know, now that that's out of your system,\\
449 - I could sure use a little more help with Jamie.\\
450 - He was up all night last night.\\
451 - So if you wouldn't mind\\
452 - taking the first shift tonight, I...\\
453 - Nod! Nod!\\
454 - Agree! She's buying it!\\
455 - Okay, Dewey, I have a new, much better plan.\\
456 - I broke into the principal's office\\
457 - and created a second, fictional Dewey,\\
458 - who lives in another district.\\
459 - I still have to hack into the school mainframe,\\
460 - but all you have to do\\
461 - is pretend you're dead for two days.\\
462 - Then we're back in business.\\
463 - That sounds great.\\
464 - Mom, Malcolm gave me the wrong\\
465 - answers to the Krelboyne test.\\
466 - I've been in the emotionally disturbed class for two weeks.\\
467 - Well, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.\\
468 - Dewey, Dewey, guess what?\\
469 - I finally figured out what kind of genius I am.\\
470 - There it was, just staring me in the face.\\
471 - Aw, come on, Dewey, please stay awake.\\
472 - I've got so much to show you.
\subsection {Episode 19: Dewey's Special Class}
1 - "How angry would you be\\
2 - if someone broke your antique music box?"\\
3 - What do you mean? Does it play at all?\\
4 - Great.\\
5 - What, were you roughhousing in my bedroom?\\
6 - And I don't suppose you're even gonna come out here\\
7 - and face your punishment?\\
8 - Hal, is that you?\\
9 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
10 -     I don't know    \\
11 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
12 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
13 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
14 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
15 -     And you're not so big    \\
16 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
17 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
18 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
19 -     And you're not so big    \\
20 -     Life is unfair.    \\
21 - Stevie, come on.\\
22 - Jonas Salk would've solved this days ago.\\
23 - He wasn't... working with...\\
24 - an idiot.\\
25 - You're calling  me  an idiot?\\
26 - You want to make\\
27 - a type-two-restriction enzyme in yeast\\
28 - without using any bacteria,\\
29 - and I'm the idiot?\\
30 - Yes...\\
31 - and yes.\\
32 - We have to... try  something.\\
33 - What do you think I've been doing for the last two weeks?\\
34 - When am I getting my room back?\\
35 - I can't work on my sexy-face out there in front of Mom.\\
36 - What are you guys doing in here anyway?\\
37 - Trying to create a new kind of restriction enzyme.\\
38 - What does it look like?\\
39 - You're messing up my room for that?\\
40 - This is important.\\
41 - Restriction enzymes are used\\
42 - for chromosome mapping,\\
43 - DNA testing, gene splicing.\\
44 - It's for a big national competition.\\
45 - If we win this,\\
46 - our paper will be published in a scientific journal.\\
47 - We'll probably be able to write our ticket\\
48 - to any college in the country.\\
49 - Then everyone... will pay.\\
50 - Only our incubator keeps breaking down.\\
51 - Plus, we're running low on agar, we're completely out of blood,\\
52 - our yeast keeps getting contaminated...\\
53 - Maybe I can help.\\
54 - That's okay, Reese.\\
55 - If we need a head caught in a wastepaper basket,\\
56 - we'll give you a call.\\
57 - Why do you do that?\\
58 - I offered to help you, and you turn it around\\
59 - and make it about me being stupid.\\
60 - Seriously.\\
61 - I might have something to contribute.\\
62 - Why don't you just give me a chance?\\
63 - That's two pints. We'd better not take any more.\\
64 - This is so exciting.\\
65 - I feel like I'm going to faint!\\
66 - Four dollars, right?\\
67 - Thanks. Say hi to Dewey for me.\\
68 - Who was that?\\
69 - Oh, some kid from Dewey's class selling chocolate.\\
70 - Enjoy your strained beets,\\
71 - little man.\\
72 - Is it that time of year again?\\
73 - Mom, please don't make me.\\
74 - Aha! I wondered what you were doing\\
75 - with a book bag.\\
76 - I don't want to go door-to-door selling stupid candy.\\
77 - Dewey, your father and I have missed everything at school this year--\\
78 - the paper drive, the car wash, the bake sale.\\
79 - We need you to pick up the slack.\\
80 - You are doing this.\\
81 - Dad, do I have to?\\
82 - Dad?\\
83 - Of course you're doing it.\\
84 - It'll be great\\
85 - for your character to sell--\\
86 - oh, what's a good number--\\
87 - 275 bars.\\
88 - Looks like there's about another half hour\\
89 - of sunlight left-- what are you waiting for?\\
90 - Fine, I'll do it!\\
91 - But I just want you to know,\\
92 - if some crazy couple steals me and then raises me as a girl,\\
93 - it's on your head.\\
94 - No, it's not.\\
95 - Hello?\\
96 - Hey, Dewey. What's going on?\\
97 - You won't believe what Mom's putting me through.\\
98 - What is it this time?\\
99 - They're doing a candy bar drive at school,\\
100 - and we've all been given a ton of candy bars to sell.\\
101 - Oh, I used to hate that.\\
102 - And you know what Mom did? What?\\
103 - She forbid me to sell them.\\
104 - She said I'd never be able\\
105 - to sell a single one.\\
106 - Oh, she did?\\
107 - That is horrible!\\
108 - I'll buy a dozen right now, Dewey.\\
109 - She even compared me selling candy to you getting married.\\
110 - You know what? Make it two dozen.\\
111 - But don't tell Mom-- she'll think I did it\\
112 - just to make her mad.\\
113 - Tell her someone else bought them.\\
114 - Wouldn't that be a lie?\\
115 - It doesn't matter.\\
116 - It's justified-- she's the reason\\
117 - that no one in this family has any confidence.\\
118 - I'm hanging up right now so I can write you a check.\\
119 - Hey, Fred, where are you going with that piglet?\\
120 - Well, can't keep him in the pen. The sow rejected him.\\
121 - So you're gonna take him home?\\
122 - Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.\\
123 - Oh, no!\\
124 - Do you have to?\\
125 - Well, listen, he's half the size\\
126 - of the rest of the litter.\\
127 - The other piglets won't let him feed.\\
128 - It's the humane thing to do.\\
129 - Fred, you can't do this. Look at his face.\\
130 - He knows you're gonna take him out and kill him.\\
131 - Well, he does  now.\\
132 - Ralph! What?\\
133 - You can't kill him if he has a name.\\
134 - It's Ralph. Little Ralph the piglet.\\
135 - Aw, geez.\\
136 - That's my kid's name. Here.\\
137 - Did it separate?\\
138 - Hell, no.\\
139 - So we still don't have an enzyme.\\
140 - What is our problem?\\
141 - We've tried...\\
142 - every variable...\\
143 - of heat... and pressure?\\
144 - Yes, yes, yes.\\
145 - We've tried acids, we've tried bases.\\
146 - How much blood do we have left?\\
147 - Plenty.\\
148 - I snuck...\\
149 - another pint... when he was sleeping.\\
150 - Stevie! He wants... to help.\\
151 - I know, but I took care of that.\\
152 - He kept bugging me, so I gave him some food coloring\\
153 - and told him they were chemicals.\\
154 - Guys, guys! I've made a discovery!\\
155 - When you mix blue and yellow, you get an entirely new color!\\
156 - I'm gonna name it...\\
157 - "blellow."\\
158 - Hey, look at this.\\
159 - Dewey has already sold 52 candy bars.\\
160 - He still has a long way to go, Lois.\\
161 - Let's keep our feet on the ground.\\
162 - For now.\\
163 - Kitty, come down.\\
164 - Fear not!\\
165 - Have your pets spayed or neutered.\\
166 - It's nice Dewey's working so hard for the school.\\
167 - If he keeps this up, we'll be able to blow off the Safety Fair.\\
168 - Hello, sir.\\
169 - Sorry. I don't eat candy.\\
170 - Oh, these aren't candy bars.\\
171 - These are America Bars.\\
172 - What are you talking about?\\
173 - You know, America Bars.\\
174 - Well, actually, I prefer the term "Freedom Bars."\\
175 - You love America, right?\\
176 - Well, of course I do.\\
177 - Well, there are a lot of people out there\\
178 - who are hoping we won't do our part.\\
179 - What do you mean?\\
180 - You know. People. People who don't have\\
181 - this country's best interests at heart.\\
182 - So, these candy bars help fight terrorism?\\
183 - With every chocolatey, nougaty bite.\\
184 - How much are they?\\
185 - $9.50.\\
186 - I'll take two.\\
187 - Thank you.\\
188 - No, young man. Thank  you.\\
189 - Separate!\\
190 - Hello...\\
191 - trade school.\\
192 - I wish Reggie would kill Archie\\
193 - and take over this comic.\\
194 - Malcolm, I need you to watch Jamie for a while.\\
195 - Mom, we're at a very critical point in our experiment.\\
196 - I'm sorry. Are you new?\\
197 - Stevie, explain to your friend how things work around here.\\
198 - Anything?\\
199 - No change.\\
200 - Bounce him higher.\\
201 - Well, none of  these  worked.\\
202 - Maybe we should...\\
203 - Oh, my God!\\
204 - It... separated!\\
205 - Yeah! We did it!\\
206 - We made an enzyme!\\
207 - Unbelievable!\\
208 - What'd you do to it?\\
209 - I didn't... do anything.\\
210 - What? Well, neither did I.\\
211 - Blellow!\\
212 - Hey, guys.\\
213 - How did... you do it?\\
214 - I didn't do anything.\\
215 - Look, we're not mad at you.\\
216 - We just need to know what you did.\\
217 - Why are you always blaming me?\\
218 - Reese, you did a good thing.\\
219 - You somehow got this thing to separate.\\
220 - You must have added something.\\
221 - What was it?\\
222 - Oh.\\
223 - I just... I don't know if I can even remember.\\
224 - I mean, I wasn't paying that much attention,\\
225 - and there was all this other stuff going on.\\
226 - And I'm not sure why I'd tell you...\\
227 - if you're not going to give me credit!\\
228 - What?\\
229 - This is a big contest.\\
230 - Big enough for the three of us.\\
231 - So, either we split the credit three ways,\\
232 - or I'm not talking.\\
233 - You are picking\\
234 - the wrong guys to mess with, Reese.\\
235 - Yeah.\\
236 - Let's tattle.\\
237 - ...and he won't tell us what he did\\
238 - unless we give him credit for it.\\
239 - It's so unfair.\\
240 - All he did was just read comic books\\
241 - and we've been working on it for weeks.\\
242 - What is it you want me to do, Malcolm?\\
243 - Force him to tell us.\\
244 - Wait a minute.\\
245 - It seems to me if Reese fixed your experiment,\\
246 - he should get some credit.\\
247 - What? No.\\
248 - He doesn't even know why it works.\\
249 - I've been working for 20 years without knowing why.\\
250 - Give Reese the credit.\\
251 - Calm down, Ralph, it's okay.\\
252 - You're all right.\\
253 - What happened?\\
254 - The other piglets were mean to him.\\
255 - Francis, you said last week\\
256 - you'd put that thing back in its pen.\\
257 - I tried, but he's just so good-natured and sweet,\\
258 - the others won't let him feed.\\
259 - I am not putting him back in there\\
260 - until I teach him to be more assertive.\\
261 - But we're spending every second of the day taking care of him.\\
262 - Hey, no one ever said raising a pig would be easy.\\
263 - No one ever said we'd be raising a pig.\\
264 - Listen, Francis...\\
265 - either you return Ralph to his pen tonight,\\
266 - or he's gonna be looking up at you from an omelet.\\
267 - Come on, Ralph.\\
268 - It's gut-check time.\\
269 - Your brothers don't think you can keep up with them.\\
270 - Is that what you think?\\
271 - Come on, I know you can do it.\\
272 - You just gotta get tough.\\
273 - Come on, show me your mean face.\\
274 - Hmm. What's that?\\
275 - Ah. The stink of failure.\\
276 - Okay, Reese. We give up.\\
277 - Just tell us what you did and we'll give you credit.\\
278 - Okay, just sign this.\\
279 - "Reese is a full partner in this experiment\\
280 - "and is entitled to a full share of the credit\\
281 - "because without his help,\\
282 - this would have been impossible."\\
283 - Outwitted...\\
284 - by a dumb ass.\\
285 - Everything seems to be in order.\\
286 - All right, Reese, tell us what you did.\\
287 - Okay.\\
288 - I have no idea.\\
289 - I don't remember doing anything special to it.\\
290 - What?! But now when you\\
291 - make fun of me and tell people I'm stupid,\\
292 - I have actual evidence in your own handwriting\\
293 - that says I'm just as smart as you are.\\
294 - Hah! Finally, there is justice in...\\
295 - This baby's mother is 13 years old.\\
296 - Every candy bar you buy\\
297 - goes towards buying unwed mothers like her\\
298 - schoolbooks and hot lunches.\\
299 - I'll get my purse.\\
300 - I'm telling you I don't remember!\\
301 - Okay, let him up.\\
302 - Reese...\\
303 - this is important.\\
304 - It's for medicine.\\
305 - This enzyme could help save somebody's life one day.\\
306 - Just please try to think about what you did.\\
307 - Um...\\
308 - I can't. I'm sorry.\\
309 - I don't know.\\
310 - I was just hanging out in the room like I always do.\\
311 - Re... create it.\\
312 - Yeah, that's a great idea.\\
313 - Just do everything you did\\
314 - when you were in the room by yourself.\\
315 - Just close your eyes and pretend.\\
316 - See everything you did in your mind's eye\\
317 - and then just do what you see.\\
318 - Stevie and I aren't even here.\\
319 - You're alone in the room just like before.\\
320 - Okay, let's see...\\
321 - First thing was...\\
322 - you guys left.\\
323 - And then I went to the test tubes...\\
324 - ...to see what an enzyme tasted like.\\
325 - But then it was boring already.\\
326 - And then... I saw something shiny...\\
327 - ...and I put it in my "shiny" box.\\
328 - And then...\\
329 - Right.\\
330 - And then I got one of Malcolm's shirts...\\
331 - and then I...\\
332 - Oh, my God.\\
333 - Then I played with Dewey's Game Boy.\\
334 - And your teacher called to say\\
335 - you sold more chocolate bars than anyone else.\\
336 - She said all your classmates hate you.\\
337 - I'm so proud, Dewey.\\
338 - Well, you know, it's a good product.\\
339 - They really sell themselves.\\
340 - I can't believe it.\\
341 - Dewey sold over 1,500 candy bars.\\
342 - 1,500...\\
343 - Page 12.\\
344 - They'll eat your dad's dust.\\
345 - Hi.\\
346 - Is this where the boy lives who's selling Eco-Bars?\\
347 - Sorry, we're all out. Come back later.\\
348 - Well, there you are. We wanted to buy some more\\
349 - of those candy bars that heal the forests.\\
350 - You should be so proud of your boy.\\
351 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
352 - Of course you do.\\
353 - You said every bar plants a seedling\\
354 - in fire-ravaged Yellowstone.\\
355 - Ooh, and I love the little bonus\\
356 - of 10% going to pro-life causes.\\
357 - Wait a minute.\\
358 - He told me 10% went to pro-choice causes.\\
359 - I didn't know you felt that way.\\
360 - I didn't know you felt that way.\\
361 - Excuse me, ladies,\\
362 - I have to tell someone how I feel.\\
363 - You are in\\
364 - so much trouble.\\
365 - I hope you'll think about what you did\\
366 - every time you see me driving by in your prize.\\
367 - He's not getting any prize.\\
368 - You've been lying\\
369 - to everyone to get them to buy candy?\\
370 - What did we tell you about lying?\\
371 - Lying is the worst thing you can do.\\
372 - It destroys character, Dewey.\\
373 - It destroys the trust people have in each other.\\
374 - Do you understand?\\
375 - Yes.\\
376 - What do you have to say for yourself?\\
377 - Francis told me to do it.\\
378 - I should have known.\\
379 - Did you tell your brother to lie about those candy bars?\\
380 - You bet I did.\\
381 - And I'm sick of you\\
382 - standing on the sidelines\\
383 - sabotaging everything we try to do.\\
384 - Have you lost your mind, Francis?\\
385 - What kind of advice is that to give to your brother?\\
386 - This is all your fault.\\
387 - I'm just trying\\
388 - to help the kid\\
389 - instead of tearing him down all the time.\\
390 - And I'm sick of you thinking\\
391 - that everything we do is stupid.\\
392 - Okay, Ralph, remember your visualization.\\
393 - You're mean, you're tough.\\
394 - You're the biggest pig in the pen\\
395 - and you're not afraid of anyone.\\
396 - Get in there, kick some ass\\
397 - and nurse like you have never nursed before.\\
398 - Hey, that's it, Ralph.\\
399 - Get in there. Good for you.\\
400 - Good.\\
401 - Okay, stop, Ralph.\\
402 - Ralph, no biting.\\
403 - Oh, not the mother, too!\\
404 - That's gross.\\
405 - No, Ralph, not the...\\
406 - chicken coop.\\
407 - If I were you, I'd hurry up and start naming the cattle.\\
408 - ...and then my ears\\
409 - were finally clean.\\
410 - Then I was going to update\\
411 - my enemies list,\\
412 - but I remembered I had math homework.\\
413 - Didn't get it.\\
414 - Didn't get it. Didn't get it.\\
415 - Didn't get it.\\
416 - Stupid. Stupid.\\
417 - Stupid. Stupid.\\
418 - Stupid.\\
419 - I hate you, I hate you.\\
420 - Then I worked on my triceps.\\
421 - Hey, no one likes math.\\
422 - Sorry.\\
423 - That's okay.\\
424 - So, what'd you do next?\\
425 - Nothing.\\
426 - I started playing with the ball.\\
427 - Well, I guess we won't...\\
428 - Throw it... again.\\
429 - What?\\
430 - Reese, keep throwing it.\\
431 - Look.\\
432 - It separated.\\
433 - It separated!\\
434 - There must be asbestos in the ceiling.\\
435 - Of course.\\
436 - What are you talking about? Reese, you did it.\\
437 - Asbestos is a highly mutagenic material.\\
438 - It can change the way cells reproduce-- these cells.\\
439 - And it's been here the whole time.\\
440 - We have asbestos in our ceiling.\\
441 - We have asbestos in our ceiling.\\
442 - We have asbestos in our ceiling.\\
443 - Yay.\\
444 - What?\\
445 - Scrabbled eggs, coming up.\\
446 - So we're living out here\\
447 - till they get the asbestos cleaned out.\\
448 - Oh, and we won the contest.\\
449 - Turns out the company sponsoring it\\
450 - keeps all the patent rights.\\
451 - They're using our work to make a new cholesterol drug\\
452 - that'll earn billions.\\
453 - And you know what we got?\\
454 - A pencil case.\\
455 - It has a compass in it.\\
456 - Mom, Dad, anybody need a pencil?\\
457 - No, Reese. We still don't need a pencil.\\
458 - Well, if you do, you know where to find it.\\
459 - Okay, Francis, how much longer are we\\
460 - going to have to share the bed with Ralph?\\
461 - It's getting ridiculous.\\
462 - He puts up a brave front,\\
463 - but I don't think he really feels that confident.\\
464 - He'll let us know when he's ready.
\subsection {Episode 20: Victor's Other Family}
1 - Guys, look, I like you both.\\
2 - You work hard, but you gotta realize\\
3 - how other people see this relationship.\\
4 - Dude ranches have a lot of conservative customers,\\
5 - so, even though I personally don't have a problem\\
6 - with you two as a couple, this has to stop.\\
7 - Thunder, get back in your own stall.\\
8 -     Life is unfair.    \\
9 - Dewey, I just found this letter!\\
10 - It says your school's going to have a father-son 5K race,\\
11 - and it was in the trash.\\
12 - I wanted to save you the trouble of agreeing to do it\\
13 - and then coming up with a bunch of lame excuses\\
14 - when you don't show up.\\
15 - It's degrading for you and even though I should know better,\\
16 - still slightly disappointing for me.\\
17 - Come on, I'm not that bad.\\
18 - Last week you missed my class\\
19 - performing an original one-act play that I wrote.\\
20 - Well, I was there yesterday\\
21 - when the mayor presented you with an award for it.\\
22 - No, you weren't.\\
23 - Well, I saw every second of the video.\\
24 - Look, son, I am going to be at that race.\\
25 - Okay, if you say so.\\
26 - I'll check.\\
27 - Mom, do you want to talk to dead Grandpa's secret other family?\\
28 - What did you say?\\
29 - This lady says she's your sister and she wants to talk to you.\\
30 - Make it fast, I have a radio station in Hawaii on hold.\\
31 - Hello?\\
32 - Hello, Lois.\\
33 - This is Roberta from Manitoba.\\
34 - Your sister?\\
35 - Halfway.\\
36 - God, this is weird.\\
37 - Hi. Um...\\
38 - What's up?\\
39 - You know, your mom's lawsuit is over.\\
40 - I hope you know I didn't have anything to do with that.\\
41 - Please-- I tried to talk her out of it,\\
42 - but she just wouldn't listen.\\
43 - And I'm so sorry she gave your phone number to those prisoners.\\
44 - Well, it's all water under the bridge.\\
45 - It's just, now that the court case is over,\\
46 - it just felt weird to have family\\
47 - that I didn't ever talk to.\\
48 - So, now I am.\\
49 - Talking.\\
50 - Uh, not very well, apparently.\\
51 - God, where is\\
52 - my diet root beer?\\
53 - You drink diet root beer?\\
54 - I drink diet root beer, too.\\
55 - I'm telling you, Hal,\\
56 - it is uncanny how much we are alike.\\
57 - We both have five letters in our middle name!\\
58 - We both like movies about English ladies\\
59 - living in tropical countries.\\
60 - We have the same ring size,\\
61 - and we both hope to go skiing one day!\\
62 - Wow. Make sure I get the right one back.\\
63 - I wish I could come.\\
64 - Although, obviously,\\
65 - not as much as I want to go racing with Dewey.\\
66 - Right, sport?\\
67 - Wouldn't it be pretty to think so.\\
68 - Get ready for 21 hours of this.\\
69 - Reese, you put him in his seat face down!\\
70 - Hello?\\
71 - Oh, hi, Mom.\\
72 - I lost the case.\\
73 - They said I was never legally married to Victor\\
74 - because there were no documents.\\
75 - Oh, that judge had guts\\
76 - after what I mailed him.\\
77 - That's very sad, Mom.\\
78 - Not married!\\
79 - Victor came to my house\\
80 - and defeated each of my brothers in combat.\\
81 - The proof was the bite marks on his back!\\
82 - Mom, I really don't want to hear this again.\\
83 - My life is horrible!\\
84 - I can't think of anything but death.\\
85 - I thought I'd come down tomorrow for a visit.\\
86 - What?!\\
87 - You want to come see us tomorrow?\\
88 - Birthday party for Jamie.\\
89 - Mother, that's a great idea.\\
90 - We would love to see you\\
91 - because tomorrow is Jamie's birthday.\\
92 - And there are going to be kids here, and balloons and songs...\\
93 - I just remembered. Tomorrow I'm getting waxed.\\
94 - I can't ring the doorbell.\\
95 - It's too weird.\\
96 - You can do it.\\
97 - Canadian doorbells work just like ours.\\
98 - No, Reese,\\
99 - I mean it's strange.\\
100 - These people have the same DNA as us.\\
101 - It's kind of spooky.\\
102 - Don't be so freaked out, Mom.\\
103 - There's nothing spooky about this.\\
104 - You must be Lois.\\
105 - And I bet\\
106 - that you're Reese and Malcolm and Jamie.\\
107 - Oh, I'm so glad you're all here.\\
108 - Come in, come in!\\
109 - So, is Dad's oth...?\\
110 - Uh... I mean, is Victor...?\\
111 - Is your mother here?\\
112 - Oh, yes.\\
113 - But she's really, uh...\\
114 - They shouldn't have come...\\
115 - until I've had time to finish the cookies.\\
116 - And my hair is just a mess!\\
117 - You look just like your father!\\
118 - Well, we're all thinking it.\\
119 - I don't care how uncomfortable this is.\\
120 - Give me a hug!\\
121 - Wow. Grandpa really went for old women.\\
122 - Genes are weird.\\
123 - Reese and I are brothers,\\
124 - and we're barely in the same species.\\
125 - But Jerome is my half-cousin,\\
126 - and we look the same, we stand the same,\\
127 - and we're already talking like we're best friends.\\
128 - Malcolm, you're describing an ontology of modality\\
129 - that's completely consistent.\\
130 - As consistent as logicism.\\
131 - And he's funny!\\
132 - Hey, Malcolm,\\
133 - I'm gonna take your brother goose hunting.\\
134 - You're taking Reese hunting?\\
135 - Yeah, you know, he says he's never held a gun before,\\
136 - but, boy, he seems like a natural with it.\\
137 - God, I hope the zombies attack today.\\
138 - So, how's your school?\\
139 - Okay, I guess.\\
140 - They've got me in this accelerated program.\\
141 - Me, too.\\
142 - It kind of sucks.\\
143 - Yeah. It's great being so popular,\\
144 - but every group of friends you're in\\
145 - expects you to go to all their parties,\\
146 - which is, like, physically impossible.\\
147 - Yeah. Impossible.\\
148 - Not to mention juggling homework, hockey practice,\\
149 - being president of the student body,\\
150 - and still trying to find enough time\\
151 - for your girlfriend.\\
152 - Oh, I have to call her.\\
153 - I'm clinging to a slight hope that she's imaginary.\\
154 - Hey, it's me.\\
155 - You did get the flowers.\\
156 - I'm glad you liked them.\\
157 - If we were born so much alike,\\
158 - why is he so much happier than me?\\
159 - Were you talking to that cute girlfriend of yours?\\
160 - Wait. You know what?\\
161 - That's none of my business.\\
162 - Oh.\\
163 - Sylvia, Roberta, your house is so lovely.\\
164 - It's just beautiful,\\
165 - and everything is so fancy.\\
166 - Well, thank you.\\
167 - I can't take much credit for it, though.\\
168 - You know Victor.\\
169 - He loved to spoil us.\\
170 - Oh, look,\\
171 - the lake house.\\
172 - I think that's the summer we nursed\\
173 - a heron back to health.\\
174 - Oh, it's beautiful.\\
175 - Here's one of the tool shed.\\
176 - One time we killed a wasp nest inside it.\\
177 - Look at this one.\\
178 - You girls are dressed like hoboes.\\
179 - Oh, was that a fun costume party?\\
180 - Yeah. Really fun. And long.\\
181 - Here's another one of Dad doing his pretend angry face.\\
182 - And you doing a pretend sad face.\\
183 - I don't think you guys are serious\\
184 - in one of these photos.\\
185 - That's us-- just a couple of kidders.\\
186 - You know, I can't get over how happy and friendly Dad looks\\
187 - in picture after picture after picture.\\
188 - Well, you know,\\
189 - Victor wasn't perfect.\\
190 - Sometimes he'd come home\\
191 - a little grumpy.\\
192 - But I'd sit him down, we'd talk it out,\\
193 - and before you knew it,\\
194 - he'd be laughing and joking\\
195 - and giving the girls hugs and kisses.\\
196 - You know, I think I need a little fresh air.\\
197 - Boy, this is weird.\\
198 - I keep thinking about why...\\
199 - things turn out the way they do.\\
200 - It's amazing how different your life could be\\
201 - if you just... changed one person.\\
202 - Tell me about it.\\
203 - You know what else is strange?\\
204 - What?\\
205 - Have you heard a bird\\
206 - or a cricket or anything in the last two minutes?\\
207 - No. Everything's gone as quiet as a graveyard.\\
208 - Judas!\\
209 - Mother, what are you doing here?!\\
210 - "Oh, Mommy, I'd love you to come to my baby's party."\\
211 - Do you think I was born yesterday?\\
212 - I could spot lies\\
213 - coming out of your mouth since before it had teeth in it.\\
214 - Lock the door.\\
215 - Ha!\\
216 - Oh, my God, Mother, she's inside!\\
217 - Lock yourself in the den.\\
218 - I'll call the police.\\
219 - So, Lois... are you enjoying your...\\
220 - collaboration?\\
221 - Looks like you sold your soul cheap enough.\\
222 - Coconut cake-- from the woman who stole your father's fluids\\
223 - and made bastards with them!\\
224 - Mother, what the hell are you doing?!\\
225 - Get out of here! The police are coming!\\
226 - Why? I don't even get to look at what was stolen from me?\\
227 - Where do you think she got this money?\\
228 - This couch was my trip to Paris!\\
229 - Look at this place. While we lived like dogs,\\
230 - they were playing on grand pianos and eating with napkins!\\
231 - Why do you think you girls\\
232 - were so short and ugly?\\
233 - Victor fed you on beans so he could give\\
234 - his other daughter ballet lessons.\\
235 - Ida, I think you should know\\
236 - that besides the restraining order,\\
237 - I have a knitting needle.\\
238 - All right, it's a crochet hook.\\
239 - Listen to me, tough guy.\\
240 - I know about Victor's other pension!\\
241 - Victor worked\\
242 - for Paragon Brush from 1960 to 1964.\\
243 - Manitoba family law\\
244 - says as common-law wife,\\
245 - I am entitled to that pension!\\
246 - I really don't know what you're talking about.\\
247 - The truth will burst out of the grave\\
248 - and strangle you and your whole family!\\
249 - Mother, we will discuss this later.\\
250 - If you do not turn and leave,\\
251 - so help me,\\
252 - I will tear that wig off of your head,\\
253 - and everyone will see your tick scars!\\
254 - It's not over.\\
255 - Canada is the greatest nation on the face of the earth!\\
256 - Hey, Grandma.\\
257 - I can't believe I've never been hunting before.\\
258 - Nature is so complex\\
259 - and beautiful... and bad at hiding.\\
260 - Never again.\\
261 - He was...\\
262 - It was...\\
263 - The horrible laughter.\\
264 - Thanks, man.\\
265 - I'm not going to need this anymore.\\
266 - Next time I want to make a little eye contact.\\
267 - All right, the race is in two days.\\
268 - Let's get out there and practice.\\
269 - Where do we keep the sports bottles?\\
270 - Do we really need props for this charade?\\
271 - Hey, when did your mom get a fire extinguisher?\\
272 - Uh, Dad, you probably don't want to...\\
273 - Why would she hide this from me?\\
274 - Yeah, Mom.\\
275 - He found it.\\
276 - The doctor says two weeks.\\
277 - Bye.\\
278 - I have to admit you almost had me fooled.\\
279 - I really thought you were going to come through this time.\\
280 - Dewey, it was an accident.\\
281 - Believe me, if I wanted to blind myself,\\
282 - there are 100 easier ways I could have done it.\\
283 - Knowing that I let you down\\
284 - hurts much more than burnt corneas.\\
285 - And they hurt a lot.\\
286 - I hate breaking a promise to you, Dewey,\\
287 - I really do.\\
288 - That's the truth.\\
289 - I remember once when my dad told me\\
290 - he was going to take me to an air show.\\
291 - Jerome's amazing.\\
292 - He was born with the same brain as me,\\
293 - but he used it to become friends\\
294 - with the kind of popular,\\
295 - well-adjusted people who hate me.\\
296 - You're right.\\
297 - Nobody cares about student council.\\
298 - But I say what's bad about getting together,\\
299 - planting a few trees\\
300 - and making the school\\
301 - a little more pleasant for everyone?\\
302 - Wow. Jerome took something seriously\\
303 - and didn't get laughed at.\\
304 - That's like the triple Lutz of high school socializing.\\
305 - I'm glad it's him, not me!\\
306 - Why couldn't that be me?\\
307 - Hey, don't forget about tomorrow night-- karaoke party.\\
308 - You do karaoke?\\
309 - Yeah, you should come.\\
310 - Uh, karaoke's not my thing.\\
311 - I mean, you can probably sing.\\
312 - No, I can't. I'm terrible.\\
313 - Then why do you do it?\\
314 - Aren't you afraid you'll look like a total idiot?\\
315 - Hey, if you're afraid of looking stupid,\\
316 - you'll never have any fun.\\
317 - He's forgetting about fun at someone else's expense.\\
318 - God, he's so much better than me.\\
319 - We froze Victor's pension\\
320 - because of the dispute with the other family.\\
321 - But you're absolutely right,\\
322 - Manitoba law states\\
323 - that a common-law wife\\
324 - is entitled to her husband's pension.\\
325 - And even if the other family isn't willing to sign a release,\\
326 - you would probably prevail in court.\\
327 - Of course, you'd have to prove you're a common-law wife\\
328 - with DNA tests of children,\\
329 - lease in both your names, phone bills, that sort of thing.\\
330 - But I think you'd win.\\
331 - Finally, a Canadian who isn't an idiot.\\
332 - The problem is, the pension's only $43.50 a month.\\
333 - Canadian.\\
334 - And what with hiring a lawyer,\\
335 - court costs, other expenses...\\
336 - it would all cost so much, I don't see you breaking even\\
337 - for 20 or 30 years.\\
338 - Do you think you'll live that long?\\
339 - God, no!\\
340 - I mean... no.\\
341 - I'm really sorry.\\
342 - Look, just so today isn't a total loss,\\
343 - I'm going to fix you up with a coupon\\
344 - for ten percent off our Elite Wonder Bristle.\\
345 - It's the brush I use.\\
346 - Okay, Mom, you tried.\\
347 - Let's go.\\
348 - No.\\
349 - We're going to do this.\\
350 - What?\\
351 - Were you listening?\\
352 - He said you're going to lose money\\
353 - going after this thing.\\
354 - I don't care.\\
355 - We're gonna get a lawyer.\\
356 - Do you really hate these people so much\\
357 - that you're willing to ruin yourself\\
358 - just to get even with them?\\
359 - It's stupid.\\
360 - He was my husband.\\
361 - Okay, here's your coupon.\\
362 - If there's anything else you need,\\
363 - feel free to give us a call.\\
364 - Just think of us as Victor's second family.\\
365 - Well, uh, third.\\
366 - Hello, Lois, dear.\\
367 - My mom's not here.\\
368 - Look, Sylvia, it turns out\\
369 - there is a pension-- a tiny one.\\
370 - $40 a month.\\
371 - Is that all?\\
372 - Yes, and my mom's all worked up about it,\\
373 - and she's willing to waste all her money\\
374 - on a court fight to get it.\\
375 - Oh, dear.\\
376 - So, I was wondering if you'd be nice enough\\
377 - to just sign a release so she could have it.\\
378 - Oh, I don't see that ever happening.\\
379 - Good-bye, dear. But you people got everything.\\
380 - For my mom, this is all she's got. I...\\
381 - She's just looking for some way\\
382 - to feel connected to her husband.\\
383 - You mean  my  husband.\\
384 - This conversation is not over!\\
385 - This conversation...\\
386 - Oh, you think that's gonna stop me?!\\
387 - You don't know who you're dealing with!\\
388 - Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. Try and hide!\\
389 - You can't hide from me!\\
390 - Aha! A canceled check\\
391 - for Dad's cyst removal with your signature on it!\\
392 - Beautiful!\\
393 - Let them try and say that's not a marriage!\\
394 - And look!\\
395 - The pig Victor got for my dowry!\\
396 - It might take a year or two,\\
397 - but we are gonna get that 40 bucks\\
398 - out of their eye sockets!\\
399 - You know, Mom, if this thing does go to trial,\\
400 - it might help us\\
401 - if you worked a little bit on your demeanor.\\
402 - You know,\\
403 - when you deal with other people,\\
404 - you could be pleasant and say, "How are you?"\\
405 - And that way people will think\\
406 - that you care about their feelings,\\
407 - and then they might care about yours.\\
408 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
409 - I'm just trying to help you.\\
410 - I know you are, Vuschka.\\
411 - I'm sorry.\\
412 - It's just a lot for me to remember.\\
413 - You can show me\\
414 - more tricks tomorrow.\\
415 - It's kind of funny, huh, Mom?\\
416 - After all these years,\\
417 - you and I are actually helping each other.\\
418 - Well, you live as long as I have,\\
419 - you get used to anything.\\
420 - What's that?\\
421 - It's the results of the blood test\\
422 - that lawyer wanted me to take.\\
423 - This says paternity is genetically impossible.\\
424 - This says that Dad is not my father!\\
425 - I was 80% sure you were his.\\
426 - What?!\\
427 - The very second Victor walked in the house,\\
428 - I dragged him to the bedroom.\\
429 - I guess his soldiers got outflanked.\\
430 - What?!\\
431 - Mother, how could you do something like that?!\\
432 - I was lonely.\\
433 - Your father had a lot\\
434 - of business trips.\\
435 - Now we know what his business was.\\
436 - Then who is my father?\\
437 - Oh, what do you want to get into that for?\\
438 - Radu Gogorsky.\\
439 - The only interesting thing about him was\\
440 - he could walk up a flight of stairs on his hands.\\
441 - What about Susan?\\
442 - Is she Dad's daughter?\\
443 - Anything's possible.\\
444 - How could you lie like this?\\
445 - Sweetie, don't be upset.\\
446 - We can change this "A" to a "B."\\
447 - The judge will completely buy it.\\
448 - Mother!\\
449 - I'm taking Jamie.\\
450 - I'm getting out of here.\\
451 - Dad, I don't want to.\\
452 - It's demeaning.\\
453 - What's demeaning about it?\\
454 - Dad, your right shoe's untied.\\
455 - See, Dewey? Teamwork!\\
456 - Runners, take your marks!\\
457 - Set!\\
458 -        \\
459 - You're next.\\
460 - Jerome, thank you.\\
461 - I thought I was genetically doomed\\
462 - to be unhappy.\\
463 - But you're my blood, and you can be happy,\\
464 - so that means\\
465 - I can, too.\\
466 - Hi.\\
467 - Hello, Lois.\\
468 - Can I pick him up?\\
469 - I talked to Mom about it.\\
470 - She's being stubborn and completely unreasonable.\\
471 - Aren't you a cutie pie?\\
472 - You are!\\
473 - I don't want us to have another argument, Lois.\\
474 - Oh, we don't have to.\\
475 - I have some news.\\
476 - We did a blood test.\\
477 - I'm not Victor's daughter.\\
478 - It turns out\\
479 - I'm not related to you people at all.\\
480 - But we're so alike!\\
481 - I know. It's amazing, isn't it?\\
482 - You know what's even more amazing?\\
483 - It doesn't change anything.\\
484 - Because no matter what,\\
485 - I know that I am Victor's daughter.\\
486 - That horrible, deceitful,\\
487 - bitter man was my father.\\
488 - He was my father when I was two,\\
489 - and he locked me in the closet.\\
490 - He was my father when I was eight,\\
491 - and he got me drunk.\\
492 - He was my father on my wedding day\\
493 - when he told Hal he could do better.\\
494 - He was my dad.\\
495 - You've got a funny little brain, young lady,\\
496 - but if it makes you feel better, I'm happy.\\
497 - Well, you know, the same way I know that he was my father,\\
498 - I know that Ida was his wife.\\
499 - Not technically, not legally,\\
500 - but I know it.\\
501 - And you know it, too.\\
502 - And that's why\\
503 - you hate her so much.\\
504 - I don't hate, dear.\\
505 - I'm Canadian.\\
506 - Well, it's why you're angry then.\\
507 - But the problem is, you're angry\\
508 - at the wrong person.\\
509 - It's not Ida.\\
510 - It's Victor, your husband, who betrayed you both,\\
511 - who manipulated you both.\\
512 - Who made you both feel\\
513 - like you weren't worth being the only one.\\
514 - You hate him,\\
515 - and you know what?\\
516 - He deserves it.\\
517 - Funny thing is, I came up here\\
518 - because I thought Roberta and I were the same,\\
519 - but it's you\\
520 - and my mother\\
521 - who are really alike.\\
522 - I'll sign whatever you want.\\
523 - Just don't ever say that again.\\
524 -        \\
525 - Come on, Malcolm. We're going.\\
526 - I'm going to stay here with my cousins.\\
527 - They're not your cousins.\\
528 - It turns out we're not even\\
529 - related to them. Now come on.\\
530 - Look, you're going to hear a lot of stories,\\
531 - none of which are true, about some weird stuff\\
532 - happening in the woods.\\
533 - There could be some grainy photos,\\
534 - but my point is, we should get over the border\\
535 - as quickly as possible.\\
536 - Let's go!\\
537 - Dewey, please.\\
538 - Can't go on much longer!\\
539 - Oh. Ha!\\
540 - I did it!\\
541 - I did it!\\
542 - I did it! I did it! I did it!
\subsection {Episode 21: Reese Joins the Army (Part 1)}
1 - Do you think babies dream?\\
2 -     Life is unfair.    \\
3 - Oh, Jamie finally fell asleep.\\
4 - Haven't you finished paying these bills yet?\\
5 - How am I supposed to know\\
6 - which ones to blow off?\\
7 - "Ultimate Final Notice"\\
8 - is obviously more serious\\
9 - than "Absolute Final Notice,"\\
10 - but pink is angrier than yellow,\\
11 - and this one's still saying, "Please."\\
12 - Would someone get my\\
13 - calculator out of the car?\\
14 - I'll get it.\\
15 - I'll go with you.\\
16 - That's Beth,\\
17 - Reese's girlfriend for the last month.\\
18 - She's really starting to bug me.\\
19 - First I had to hear them through their baby-talk phase.\\
20 - Then they had their giggling phone call phase.\\
21 - Now they're on their endless making-out phase.\\
22 - It's gotten to the point where I can't tell\\
23 - if they're kissing or cleaning each other.\\
24 - Well, forget this one.\\
25 - What's the vet going to do?\\
26 - Bring Dewey's bird back to life?\\
27 - The Feds arrested Morrison today.\\
28 - He locked himself in the supply cabinet\\
29 - and they just carried the whole thing out.\\
30 - God, haven't they finished arresting people yet?\\
31 - Dewey, could you please not do that right now?\\
32 - Look, I need to have both the Debussy\\
33 - and the Ravel nailed by tomorrow morning.\\
34 - The selection committee for the youth music festival\\
35 - won't be impressed with simple etudes.\\
36 - What?\\
37 - I'm just sharing my day.\\
38 - Thanks for taking an interest.\\
39 - Okay, we'll be studying.\\
40 - Wait, where's\\
41 - my calculator?\\
42 - Oh.\\
43 - I'll get it.\\
44 - I'll go with you.\\
45 - Buckle up.\\
46 - I'm Agent Stone. This is Agent Scurry.\\
47 - We're from the FBI.\\
48 - I thought it was just a squirrel.\\
49 - That's why I kept going.\\
50 - God, if I could have that day back, I would give anything...\\
51 - Sir, this is about\\
52 - the company you work for.\\
53 - In the last eight months\\
54 - we've filed 230 criminal indictments.\\
55 - People are flying into jail cells.\\
56 - It's beautiful.\\
57 - Except for\\
58 - your department.\\
59 - But we're just about ready to pounce on Ken Wixted.\\
60 - Ken Wixted?\\
61 - We've got him dead-to-rights. We just need you\\
62 - to confirm a couple of key details.\\
63 - Did you ever see Ken Wixted\\
64 - change the numbers on a Section 13B filing\\
65 - after it was signed by the company auditors?\\
66 - What? No.\\
67 - Did he ever mention, maybe in passing,\\
68 - anything about an offshore account\\
69 - in the Cayman Islands, or a villa?\\
70 - Anything about a villa?\\
71 - I don't think so.\\
72 - Hal, we really,\\
73 - really need you to search your memory.\\
74 - Think hard about whether you're remembering right,\\
75 - or whether you should change your answer to yes.\\
76 - Do you want me to lie?\\
77 - We're just asking if you'd like to confirm\\
78 - what everybody already knows,\\
79 - or whether you'd like to provoke the full fury\\
80 - of the United States government.\\
81 - Now, can you swing by\\
82 - my kid's school?\\
83 - I forgot to give him his lunch.\\
84 - Beth.\\
85 - Are your parents passed out yet?\\
86 - Yeah, but what are you doing?\\
87 - I thought you\\
88 - were working late.\\
89 - Why are you dressed like that?\\
90 - Because I've been thinking about\\
91 - this moment for a long time,\\
92 - and I want it to be perfect.\\
93 - Beth, I have something to tell you.\\
94 - Beth... I love you.\\
95 - I love you. I love you.\\
96 - Oh, God.\\
97 - This is going to be so horrible for you.\\
98 - I am so sorry.\\
99 - What do you mean?\\
100 - I want to break up.\\
101 - Oh.\\
102 - Yeah, yeah, that's okay.\\
103 - Yeah, that's fine.\\
104 - You know,\\
105 - I was just kidding\\
106 - anyway about... yeah.\\
107 - It's no biggie.\\
108 - Look, Reese.\\
109 - It's not you,\\
110 - it's me.\\
111 - I just think I can do better.\\
112 - I think we should end it now before things get even...\\
113 - Can we stop that music?\\
114 - I should go.\\
115 - Reese, if I could make\\
116 - myself like you, I would.\\
117 - What's that?\\
118 - Reese, stop, you're going to wake up my parents.\\
119 - You really don't want to do this. It's not what...\\
120 - She grew on me.\\
121 - Please don't kill me.\\
122 - You can break my fingers.\\
123 - Or if you just want to rest,\\
124 - I'll break them for you.\\
125 - I just want you to be happy.\\
126 - Wow, I thought there'd be a huge fistfight.\\
127 - I mean, I had no right to expect it,\\
128 - but I would have understood.\\
129 - They want you\\
130 - to lie?\\
131 - They never said that exactly.\\
132 - Well, the big guy never said anything.\\
133 - These guys are serious, Lois.\\
134 - And they're everywhere.\\
135 - It's scary.\\
136 - Well, I aced my audition.\\
137 - They're sending me to the state finals.\\
138 - So now I just need to tell them how many\\
139 - family members are coming.\\
140 - Dewey, we're in the middle of something important here.\\
141 - So that's me and everybody who cares about me.\\
142 - One.\\
143 - Do you believe the way these guys operate?\\
144 - They find some weak little patsy\\
145 - they're sure's going to crack under the slightest pressure\\
146 - just so they don't have to do their own legwork.\\
147 - I'm embarrassed for both of us.\\
148 - Well, this is America, Hal.\\
149 - You are not going to lie to put someone\\
150 - in jail who might be innocent.\\
151 - You are right, and you know what?\\
152 - I'm going to tell them that right now.\\
153 - You've taken my arms and legs.\\
154 - What else do you want?\\
155 - I want your eyeballs for my chocolate sundae.\\
156 - But I'll be blind,\\
157 - and your sundae will only taste a little bit better.\\
158 - I'm the worst brother ever!\\
159 - Malcolm, Malcolm.\\
160 - Wake up! Reese is gone.\\
161 - What? Where'd he go? The note didn't say.\\
162 - "If my own brother could stab me through the heart..."\\
163 - Blah, blah, blah...\\
164 - "Teardrops..."\\
165 - Blah, blah, blah...\\
166 - "Good-bye forever."\\
167 - Look.\\
168 - Mom and Dad are going to make\\
169 - a big deal out of this. Let's just sit on it\\
170 - till I get an answer about my music festival.\\
171 - What's happening? What are you doing?\\
172 - Wixted rolled over on you, Hal.\\
173 - He told us all about your offshore accounts\\
174 - in the Cayman Islands,\\
175 - altering documents, the villa, everything.\\
176 - Can't he at least put some pants on?\\
177 - Just as soon as we get a good\\
178 - perp-walk out of him.\\
179 - This is ridiculous!\\
180 - He doesn't belong in jail!\\
181 - He doesn't even look in the back\\
182 - of the TV Guide for the crossword answers!\\
183 - Honey, I love you.\\
184 - Keep the phone bill paid\\
185 - so I can call you.\\
186 - And the trick to the thermostat\\
187 - is to push in before you twist it.\\
188 - Sir, you need to stand still.\\
189 - And I need a lawyer.\\
190 - Not Reese's. I-I want a good one.\\
191 - Sir, you need to stop squirming.\\
192 - Boys, go back in the house.\\
193 - Boys, your daddy loves you very much.\\
194 - And don't worry about this.\\
195 - Sir, this is your last warning.\\
196 - Believe in the American\\
197 - Justice Sys...\\
198 - I guess Dad's a no.\\
199 - Don't worry, Hal.\\
200 - I will be there first thing in the morning.\\
201 - Yes, I will bring your shaving cream and your toothbrush.\\
202 - No, Hal, do not make a break for it.\\
203 - Say it back to me.\\
204 - Okay. I love you.\\
205 - That's not evidence!\\
206 - Those are my birth control pills!\\
207 - I brought them with me!\\
208 - The beagle made a pointy foot.\\
209 - It's out of my hands, lady.\\
210 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
211 - At least leave me one.\\
212 - Francis, don't make any more trouble than we already have.\\
213 - And you do not have a warrant to vandalize our house!\\
214 - When this is all over, you are going to be chalking tires\\
215 - all the way from here to Montreal!\\
216 - Don't you threaten me, lady.\\
217 -        \\
218 - ...with both hands and a flashlight!\\
219 - Okay.\\
220 - The lawyer's supposed to meet me here at 7:00.\\
221 - If I'm late, feed him something,\\
222 - but not the tuna casserole.\\
223 - That has to last for the next four days.\\
224 - Hopefully, by that time, your father will...\\
225 - Somebody better do those dishes.\\
226 - Mom, don't worry.\\
227 - Just do what you have to do.\\
228 - We'll look after the house. I have to go.\\
229 - Don't let me forget to get\\
230 - your father's allergy medication\\
231 - and pick up his suit for the hearing.\\
232 - You want me to do anything?\\
233 - Well, you could steal your brother's girlfriend.\\
234 - Oh, wait, you already did that.\\
235 - I know what I did was awful.\\
236 - Believe me, I know,\\
237 - and I don't even want forgiveness,\\
238 - but I think if you all just give me a chance,\\
239 - I can prove that I'm a better person than this.\\
240 - My eyes are up here.\\
241 - I'm just going to have to find Reese, that's all.\\
242 - It shouldn't be too hard.\\
243 - Where's he going to go, anyway?\\
244 - Welcome to the U.S. Army,\\
245 - your home for the next three years.\\
246 - You will proceed single-file on the yellow stripe\\
247 - to the processing facility.\\
248 - Do not overwork your tiny little brains\\
249 - trying to figure out what the other stripes are for.\\
250 - Now move!\\
251 - Not good enough?\\
252 - I'm good enough for this place.\\
253 - Hold it!\\
254 - Are you sure you're 18?\\
255 - Got the driver's license to prove it.\\
256 - All right, Private Jetson.\\
257 - Get back in line!\\
258 - I'm garbage.\\
259 - I belong in a garbage can.\\
260 - I am garbage.\\
261 - I belong in a garbage can.\\
262 - I am garbage.\\
263 - I belong in a garbage can. I am...\\
264 - Does he have to wear that thing?\\
265 - Hey, it was either house arrest or jail.\\
266 - I think we made the right choice.\\
267 - All right,\\
268 - your anklet sends a signal\\
269 - to the tamperproof base station.\\
270 - Your court order says\\
271 - you have to stay within a 50-foot radius.\\
272 - Can I shower with this?\\
273 - Oh, now you're snapping at me?\\
274 - Okay, you just lost ten feet.\\
275 - What are you doing?\\
276 - Let me tell you how this works.\\
277 - You may have a court order,\\
278 - but the truth is I can set this\\
279 - to whatever I want: 200 miles or four inches.\\
280 - Oh, look. You're vacationing in Vegas.\\
281 - Whoops. You can't get out of your own bathroom.\\
282 - Lois, I've been in the public defender's office\\
283 - for ten years, and I can tell you\\
284 - that arraignment was not a disaster.\\
285 - I bet we can get 'em down to conspiracy to commit fraud.\\
286 - That's what he's already charged with!\\
287 - Oh.\\
288 - Do you have a pen?\\
289 - Look, I know how overworked you are,\\
290 - but from now on, you have only one case:\\
291 - an innocent man with five children\\
292 - and a wife whose lives are teetering\\
293 - on the brink of oblivion.\\
294 - Please don't let that happen.\\
295 - You have to save my family.\\
296 - You are the only person who can help us.\\
297 - Lois, I swear to you, I will work night and day\\
298 - to get your husband out of this.\\
299 - My screenplay can wait a few months.\\
300 - I'm sorry, Hal.\\
301 - I have to go to work, but don't worry.\\
302 - We will get through this.\\
303 - I love you.\\
304 - Oh, I have the most amazing wife.\\
305 - Now you're going to throw that in my face?\\
306 - That cost you five feet.\\
307 - All right, troop, you're next.\\
308 - Get in the chair.\\
309 - Okay, I was thinking something like this.\\
310 - Look at this lifeguard.\\
311 - Is there a straight-guy version of that,\\
312 - 'cause that'd be perfect for me.\\
313 - Okay, if you stop here, I think I can still make it work.\\
314 - It'll look longer when it's combed out, right?\\
315 - There's no way\\
316 - I would have picked the laundry\\
317 - if I knew that this stuff was in it.\\
318 - You're afraid of your mother's underwear?\\
319 - What's the big deal about your mother's underwear?\\
320 - Stop saying "mother's underwear."\\
321 - I don't know how much longer Mom can handle all this--\\
322 - the double shifts, the bills,\\
323 - the meetings\\
324 - with the police and the lawyers.\\
325 - Don't forget the missing son.\\
326 - I'm going to find him!\\
327 - Well, if anyone cares,\\
328 - my flight number is five...\\
329 - Oh, hey, Mom.\\
330 - Just give us a second, and we'll clear\\
331 - all this stuff off the bed for you.\\
332 - What time does she want\\
333 - the alarm set?\\
334 - 5:30.\\
335 - We're also supposed to brush our teeth.\\
336 - Good morning, maggots!\\
337 - Now, I want you to understand why I call you maggots.\\
338 - The maggot is the slimy, quivering larval form\\
339 - of the common housefly, and we all know what maggots eat.\\
340 - And I will be the guy providing...\\
341 - Good God.\\
342 - I bet there's a great story for this, isn't there, son?\\
343 - Hang on.\\
344 - Of course.\\
345 - Okay.\\
346 - Would you like to tell me\\
347 - what happened to your gear, Private?\\
348 - Oh, I traded it.\\
349 - I got this and five cartridges.\\
350 - So, you just blithely gave away\\
351 - your government-issued rucksack and poncho?\\
352 - Well, the pack, I figure, I can eventually get\\
353 - off a dead guy, and the poncho?\\
354 - Come on. Does it look like rain to you?\\
355 -     My drill sergeant helps me learn    \\
356 -     I am just a lowly worm    \\
357 -     He commands the sun and rain    \\
358 - Right.     I am just a human stain    \\
359 -     My drill...    \\
360 - Oh, my God! Jamie!\\
361 - Jamie.\\
362 - Jamie, honey,\\
363 - c-come to Daddy.\\
364 - Come to Daddy, Jamie.\\
365 - Come on. Jamie!\\
366 - Look inside the basket.\\
367 - Look, Jamie, it's your favorite.\\
368 - Jamie, don't go in there. That's dangerous!\\
369 - No, no, no, no.\\
370 - You stay away from there.\\
371 - Don't you touch that.\\
372 - Attaboy.\\
373 - Attaboy, Jamie!\\
374 - There.\\
375 - Hello.\\
376 - Hello, Hal.\\
377 - I have some information that can help you.\\
378 - What? Who is this?\\
379 - I'm not going to tell you, but I know you're innocent,\\
380 - and I can prove it.\\
381 - We need to meet\\
382 - face to face, somewhere where there's a crowd.\\
383 - But I can't...\\
384 - Look, if you want to stay\\
385 - out of jail, you'll do it.\\
386 - Why can't you come here?\\
387 - Your place is being watched.\\
388 - Your phone's probably bugged, too.\\
389 - Meet me Thursday\\
390 - at noon at the place where you go\\
391 - when you say you're getting more toner.\\
392 - The Donut Shack?\\
393 - All right, plan "B."\\
394 - Meet me at the place where you go\\
395 - when you say you've got a dentist appointment.\\
396 - Don't say where it is.\\
397 - Got it.\\
398 - Hey, I know who this is.\\
399 - You're...\\
400 - My drill sergeant's breath is not my concern!\\
401 - My drill sergeant's breath is not my concern!\\
402 - My drill sergeant's breath is not my concern!\\
403 - So, I put the base station in there\\
404 - with a portable power supply.\\
405 - I modulated a standard cell phone to mimic the analog modem.\\
406 - Just make sure you stay within 30 feet of this backpack.\\
407 - Don't worry. I've got the ankle bracelet completely camouflaged.\\
408 - Can you believe your mom wanted to give these to the blind?\\
409 - Remember, you have to be back by 4:00.\\
410 - That's when Mom gets home.\\
411 - And you understand how important it is\\
412 - to keep this from her, don't you?\\
413 - Francis, you're in charge of making sure\\
414 - Malcolm doesn't betray me, like he's prone to do.\\
415 - Absolutely.\\
416 - Well, troop, you've polished your boots before everyone else.\\
417 - How on God's good earth did you accomplish that miracle?\\
418 - I just did it exactly the way you told me to.\\
419 - Remove laces, pull tongue forward,\\
420 - apply polish, pull tongue backward,\\
421 - buff, replace laces, repeat.\\
422 - I did the same thing to make my bed and secure my foot locker.\\
423 - Well, that's the most miraculous turnaround that I've ever seen.\\
424 - I want you to explain to these recruits\\
425 - how the worst soldier in the unit\\
426 - has managed to put them all to shame!\\
427 - I just stopped thinking.\\
428 - I figured out that using my brain was the whole problem...\\
429 - not just here, but my entire life.\\
430 - If I just do exactly what I'm told and nothing else,\\
431 - then everything gets easy.\\
432 - It's not even a question of smart or dumb.\\
433 - You just turn yourself into a tool.\\
434 - I'm much happier that way.\\
435 - I'm the world's happiest tool.\\
436 - You must be proud of yourself, son.\\
437 - I don't know if I am or not.\\
438 - I'm waiting for you to tell me.\\
439 - My God.\\
440 - A soldier like you comes along once in a thousand years.\\
441 - Mom! You're home early.\\
442 - Yup. Got fired. What?!\\
443 - I gave someone $2,000\\
444 - in change instead of $20.\\
445 - But you know what?\\
446 - We just adapt. We move forward.\\
447 - I'll get another job,\\
448 - and in the meantime, I can get started on dinner.\\
449 - Actually, they repossessed the fridge this morning.\\
450 - Fine. We will get through this.\\
451 - It's okay.\\
452 - He's all right.\\
453 - Just got away from me for a second.\\
454 - And we will get through this... as long as we're together,\\
455 - as long as we have each other.\\
456 - We are a family. Where's Dad?\\
457 - He's gone.\\
458 - I think I'll take a shower.\\
459 - Left, right, left, right!\\
460 - Fork up! In! Chew, chew!\\
461 - Left to right!\\
462 - Front to back!\\
463 - Bear down!\\
464 - Pinch!\\
465 - One, two, three, four...\\
466 - 29, 30.\\
467 - Listen, I don't have much time.\\
468 - I know everybody who's in on this,\\
469 - and I know exactly what they did\\
470 - because I helped 'em.\\
471 - What? They paid me millions.\\
472 - I was happy just to sit back\\
473 - and watch you take a fall.\\
474 - But then I found out I'm dying.\\
475 - I got six months at the most.\\
476 - Oh, my God. I'm sorry.\\
477 - Listen, I can't go to my grave with this on my conscience,\\
478 - so I'm flipping on all of them-- I'm going to tell the truth...\\
479 - ...but we can't tip our hand.\\
480 - They're too powerful.\\
481 - If they even get a whiff of this,\\
482 - they'll just fabricate new documents,\\
483 - and we'll both go down.\\
484 - You won't hear from me\\
485 - until I show up at the courthouse.\\
486 - Don't follow me.\\
487 - I've also got some overdue book fines\\
488 - I want to get off my conscience.\\
489 - Mom, will you at least\\
490 - talk to us?\\
491 - I'm in the shower, honey.\\
492 - Yes, we know you're in the shower.\\
493 - It's been three hours now.\\
494 - The water must be freezing.\\
495 - Do I bother you when you're in the shower?\\
496 - Mom, listen, I know how hard this is for you.\\
497 - I know how scared you are,\\
498 - but you know what?\\
499 - You've got a family that depends on you,\\
500 - and as impossible\\
501 - as it seems, you just got\\
502 - to suck it up one more time.\\
503 - Just one more time, Mom; that's all we need.\\
504 - You know you can do this.\\
505 - In a minute. I'm in the shower.\\
506 - Ooh!\\
507 - Sorry, Officer. Excuse me.\\
508 - You in a hurry? You know, busy day.\\
509 - You understand. Is that your backpack?\\
510 - Oh, uh, no, no. Absolutely not.\\
511 - Better check it out.\\
512 - Whoa! I think we got a bomb here.\\
513 - You got to get out of here.\\
514 - No, I-I can't.\\
515 - Sir, I need you to step away\\
516 - to a distance of at least 150 feet.\\
517 - I can't do that. I'm... I'm...\\
518 - I'm in the bomb squad.\\
519 - What? That's right.\\
520 - You better let a professional handle this.\\
521 - Damn. I was a week from retirement.\\
522 - You get to safety. I'll take it from here.\\
523 - Yes, sir.
\subsection {Episode 22: Reese Joins the Army (Part 2)}
1 - Previously on Malcolm in the Middle... I love you.\\
2 - I want to break up.\\
3 - Welcome to the US Army!\\
4 - You are not going to lie\\
5 - to put someone in jail who might be innocent.\\
6 - Can't he at least put some pants on?\\
7 - Just as soon as we get a good perp walk out of him.\\
8 - Your court order says you have\\
9 - to stay within a 50-foot radius.\\
10 - My drill sergeant's breath is not my concern!\\

24 - to a distance of at least 150 feet.\\
25 - I can't do that.\\
26 - I'm... I'm...\\
27 - I'm in the bomb squad.\\
28 -     Yes, no, maybe    \\
29 -     I don't know    \\
30 -     Can you repeat the question?    \\
31 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
32 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
33 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
34 -     And you're not so big    \\
35 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
36 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
37 -     You're not the boss of me now    \\
38 -     And you're not so big    \\
39 -     Life is unfair.    \\
40 - You're not alone.\\
41 - We've called every available police officer\\
42 - in the Tri-County area.\\
43 - Are you sure you don't need any equipment?\\
44 - We've got some needle-nose pliers.\\
45 - No! Stay away!\\
46 - Everyone has to stay away!\\
47 - This thing is picking up a lot of vibrations right now.\\
48 - I said get back.\\
49 - Do you have a death wish, Officer?\\
50 - I'm Lieutenant Sortino with the bomb squad.\\
51 - I'm here to help. What's your name?\\
52 - No time for introductions.\\
53 - We've got a level five explosive\\
54 - with a gravity timer and a percussion fuse.\\
55 - What bomb squad did you say you were with?\\
56 - Millbrook.\\
57 - I'm off duty.\\
58 - Came by to return a library book.\\
59 - You've got a better selection here.\\
60 - And they charge 50 cents a day back home.\\
61 - Now, I know the fines help pay\\
62 - for the place, but that's really\\
63 - a very small part of the budget.\\
64 - Now, if we are finished playing 20 questions,\\
65 - I've got lives to save.\\
66 - Since you guys seem more up to date in Millbrook,\\
67 - I'm just going to go call your supervisor,\\
68 - see if he can send some backup.\\
69 - Hoo-hoo! Sure.\\
70 - If you can find him.\\
71 - Okay, I'm going to try to detach the coaxial...\\
72 - Oh, no!\\
73 - I cut the wrong wire!\\
74 - It's gonna blow!\\
75 - Tell my wife I love her!\\
76 - Five!\\
77 - Four!\\
78 - Three!\\
79 - Two!\\
80 - One!\\
81 - See? You don't need grocery money if you're creative.\\
82 - I wish I had better news for you, Hal, but the prosecution\\
83 - has 30 eyewitnesses that can all avoid\\
84 - going to prison themselves by fingering you.\\
85 - How about my mystery guy?\\
86 - He's only got six months to live.\\
87 - He doesn't want to die with a guilty conscience.\\
88 - He's gonna completely exonerate me.\\
89 - And he's not imaginary.\\
90 - This is pretty much how things\\
91 - have been going around here lately.\\
92 - Dad's trial starts tomorrow,\\
93 - we still have no idea where Reese is,\\
94 - and Mom kind of had a breakdown.\\
95 - It's okay. She's slowly working her way back.\\
96 - I think her new hobby's helping her.\\
97 - This one's name is Sam Gundlebumps.\\
98 - He grew up on a farm where he was friends with a turkey and a duck.\\
99 - He can't see very well, so he's always getting lost.\\
100 - It'll be okay, Lois.\\
101 - We're gonna find Reese.\\
102 - Look, he picked flowers.\\
103 - He's going a-courtin'.\\
104 - Right face!\\
105 - Left face!\\
106 - About face!\\
107 - Right arm windmill!\\
108 - Hop on your left foot!\\
109 - Teapot!\\
110 - About face!\\
111 - Forward march!\\
112 - He'll do that all day.\\
113 - He's got no more thought than a bug.\\
114 - It's almost enough to restore my faith\\
115 - in the future of this army.\\
116 - I guess those subliminal ads are working after all.\\
117 - The army doesn't use subliminal ads.\\
118 - At ease!\\
119 - Now, in a few days we have some\\
120 - very important field training exercises,\\
121 - and I want you to be my number two,\\
122 - because you will obey my every command\\
123 - like some kind of beautiful, brainless zombie robot.\\
124 - I'd be honored, Drill Sergeant.\\
125 - Now let's go make some bets\\
126 - and march you into the electric fence.\\
127 - I saw the defendant\\
128 - hack through the proxy server's firewall,\\
129 - and delete the SPE files without leaving any tracks.\\
130 - I didn't totally understand it,\\
131 - but he said the dummy corporation\\
132 - could be used to launder all the money we siphoned off.\\
133 - You can threaten my children all you want!\\
134 - I don't care!\\
135 - I have to tell the truth!\\
136 - For God's sakes, do something.\\
137 - Just be patient.\\
138 - There's such a thing as too much evidence.\\
139 - Eventually they'll get bored.\\
140 - The prosecution calls Gordon Walker.\\
141 - That's him. That's my guy.\\
142 - I was worried about what I would say when I got up here,\\
143 - but deep down, I knew\\
144 - I would have to tell the truth.\\
145 - There's a conspiracy going on here,\\
146 - and it's all been orchestrated\\
147 - by that man.\\
148 - Is he pointing at someone directly behind me?\\
149 - And after he shredded the last of the documents,\\
150 - he delivered the punch line\\
151 - to yet another racist joke.\\
152 - No further questions.\\
153 - Turns out I'm gonna live.\\
154 - They had the wrong X ray.\\
155 - Boy, when you've had a scare like mine,\\
156 - you realize what's really important--\\
157 - staying out of jail.\\
158 - Good luck.\\
159 - With this many people lying,\\
160 - we've got to be able to find something to trip one of them up.\\
161 - Let's not get our hopes up.\\
162 - Mom, I know you've had a rough time\\
163 - and that your little projects are very therapeutic for you,\\
164 - but Dad is in very big trouble.\\
165 - You have to start helping.\\
166 - Honey, I know this is a crisis,\\
167 - and believe me, I'm doing everything I can.\\
168 - I spent extra money on quick-drying glue,\\
169 - so no matter how you shake it, the sequins won't fall off.\\
170 - After what happened at Compulsories,\\
171 - Rebecca's really got to nail her long program.\\
172 - Those flour bombs just don't do it for me.\\
173 - I miss the old days when we got to use live ordnance.\\
174 - That looked like the movies.\\
175 - Tell your men advance\\
176 - northwest, 20 meters.\\
177 - Advance northwest, 20 meters!\\
178 - North-northeast, five meters!\\
179 - North-northeast, five meters!\\
180 - Crap. I'm hit!\\
181 - I'm gonna go die over here in the shade.\\
182 - Get to the rendezvous point!\\
183 - Bravo, lay down cover fire! Alpha, flank right.\\
184 - Get to the rendezvous point! Bravo, lay down cover fire.\\
185 - Alpha, flank right!\\
186 - You are really showing\\
187 - leadership, soldier!\\
188 - I am really showing leadership!\\
189 - I'm allergic to wheat products!\\
190 - This is going to be awesome.\\
191 - You've got to watch this.\\
192 - He swells up like a balloon.\\
193 - Hey!\\
194 - We got a vehicle from Blue Team approaching.\\
195 - Squad Leader!\\
196 - Intercept that vehicle!\\
197 - Yes, Sergeant!\\
198 - Oh, no!\\
199 - Oh, my God, are you okay?\\
200 - God, I  love  that boy.\\
201 - More Blue Team vehicles approaching-- should we run?\\
202 - Sergeant! Sergeant!\\
203 - Forget the sergeant!\\
204 - Just say we can run!\\
205 - Sergeant? Sergeant?\\
206 - Idiot! Move!\\
207 - Reese! Come on!\\
208 - Can we go?!\\
209 - Sergeant? Sergeant?\\
210 - Sergeant? Sergeant?\\
211 - Sergeant?\\
212 - Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard a staggering amount\\
213 - of evidence against the defendant.\\
214 - Let me clarify what we now know.\\
215 - Three members of the board of directors\\
216 - testified that the defendant\\
217 - submitted altered financial statements on August 9.\\
218 - The Senior VP of Finance\\
219 - heard the defendant plot to hide\\
220 - company assets offshore on December 6.\\
221 - The Chief Operations Officer\\
222 - saw him shredding documents in a stairwell\\
223 - on February 21.\\
224 - And on June 27, the Director of IT Services\\
225 - testified that the defendant\\
226 - showed him pictures of his new yacht\\
227 - which he named  Above the Law.\\
228 - And, on July 11,\\
229 - you heard the Senior Analyst\\
230 - break down in tears as he revealed\\
231 - the defendant's scheme\\
232 - to bilk the company out of millions...\\
233 - What are you doing?\\
234 - Shh. I'm awake.\\
235 - I'm trying to get you grounds for an appeal.\\
236 - Mom? Are you coming out for dinner?\\
237 - I'm just taking Penelope's temperature.\\
238 - I think she caught Ambrosia's cold.\\
239 - Is Penelope the foreign correspondent\\
240 - or the candy striper?\\
241 - No, she's just a homemaker,\\
242 - but a big candy company's\\
243 - interested in her taffy recipe.\\
244 - Can I have the potatoes?\\
245 - You can have anything you want, son,\\
246 - if you're willing to work for it.\\
247 - Just reach for the stars\\
248 - and never let go.\\
249 - I should have told you that a long time ago.\\
250 - And when you write an angry letter,\\
251 - hold onto it for a day.\\
252 - You might not feel the same in the morning.\\
253 - And never invest\\
254 - in a friend's restaurant. Never.\\
255 - You know what?\\
256 - I'm not hungry.\\
257 - Come on, Dewey, let's go teach you\\
258 - how to shave.\\
259 - Great!\\
260 - When you tip a valet,\\
261 - always fold your dollar up real tight.\\
262 - That way, by the time he sees what he's got,\\
263 - you're down the block.\\
264 - Dad?\\
265 - I made coffee. You want some?\\
266 - Oh, hi.\\
267 - I was just singing.\\
268 - Always have a song in your heart, son.\\
269 - Thanks.\\
270 - You know what the worst thing is?\\
271 - I have always hated that job.\\
272 - I wanted to quit\\
273 - ten years ago when they started\\
274 - deducting for sick days.\\
275 - I wanted to quit a year ago\\
276 - when they started making us\\
277 - vacuum out our own cubicles.\\
278 - If I'd have done that,\\
279 - they would have found another patsy\\
280 - and I wouldn't have been in this mess.\\
281 - They should have just fired me.\\
282 - I was a terrible employee.\\
283 - I never read a memo,\\
284 - I came in late, I blew off Fridays.\\
285 - What the hell is wrong with those people?\\
286 - Just promise me\\
287 - that you'll learn from my mistakes.\\
288 - Don't ever settle, Malcolm.\\
289 - I won't.\\
290 - I'm going to go make love to your mother one last time.\\
291 - I probably wasn't going to sleep tonight anyway.\\
292 - Malcolm, we have to talk.\\
293 - We've been avoiding this, but it's\\
294 - time to face the facts.\\
295 - We need you to forge Dad's signature on this document\\
296 - declaring Mom mentally incompetent.\\
297 - That way, when Dad goes to jail,\\
298 - you can get emancipated\\
299 - and I'll take custody of Dewey and Jamie.\\
300 - It's funny.\\
301 - I always figured Mom for jail and Dad for the loony bin.\\
302 - Life, huh?\\
303 - I can't fake Dad's signature.\\
304 - I do Mom. Reese does Dad.\\
305 - What?\\
306 - You should each be able to do both.\\
307 - What did I tell you about building\\
308 - a little redundancy into the system?\\
309 - Wait a second.\\
310 - Oh, my God.\\
311 - What is it? I need to talk to Dad right now.\\
312 - Maybe I'll wait 20 minutes.\\
313 - What were your orders, Private?!\\
314 - I don't know. Ask the sergeant.\\
315 - Tell us your call signs and frequencies!\\
316 - I don't know. Ask the sergeant.\\
317 - We don't have to do this\\
318 - the hard way.\\
319 - Let's all take a break\\
320 - and relax a little.\\
321 - You want a glass of water?\\
322 - I don't know. Ask the sergeant.\\
323 - Stop saying that!\\
324 - This may not be a real war,\\
325 - but I got an extra day's leave riding on this,\\
326 - and a girlfriend who is in model school.\\
327 - Model school!\\
328 - Now you will talk or I will make your life a living hell!\\
329 - You don't think I want to?!\\
330 - This sucks! I've been a good soldier!\\
331 - I shut off my brain like the Army wanted.\\
332 - Everyone said I was doing great, but I'm not!\\
333 - I have to help my squad.\\
334 - The guys are depending on me, but I can't!\\
335 - You know what? I don't care what the Army says.\\
336 - I'm sick of this!\\
337 - I'm turning my brain back on!\\
338 - Did it happen?\\
339 - Did what happen?\\
340 - Wait...\\
341 - I think it's...\\
342 - No, it's not.\\
343 - Yes, it is.\\
344 - Is it?\\
345 - Damn, I wish there was more of a difference.\\
346 - Look, you can act as crazy as you'd like,\\
347 - 'cause I got nothing but time.\\
348 - And no one's coming to rescue you.\\
349 - Not your sergeant, not your squad,\\
350 - and your mama's not going to come\\
351 - and wipe your nose and change your diaper.\\
352 - Mom.\\
353 - Mom. Of course.\\
354 - Freak held his breath\\
355 - until he turned blue and then passed out.\\
356 - Yeah! Whoo!\\
357 - Haven't done that in a while.\\
358 - You okay? I'm fine.\\
359 - I know how to get us out of here.\\
360 - That's impossible. Look around. We're in prison, man.\\
361 - Wrong. We are not in prison. We're grounded.\\
362 - And there's always a way to get out of being grounded.\\
363 - You can pry up some floorboards...\\
364 - set your bed on fire.\\
365 - There's only two things you have to remember.\\
366 - You need a diversion\\
367 - and the little guy gets screwed.\\
368 - But that's okay.\\
369 - He's too little to do anything about it.\\
370 - You're going to have\\
371 - to eat some dirt-- about three pounds of it.\\
372 - What good's a diversion going to do? We're tied up.\\
373 - I guess your brothers never tied you up\\
374 - and left you in a Dumpster on trash day.\\
375 - Okay, start eating.\\
376 - It's not fatal, it only looks like it.\\
377 - We need more shovels!\\
378 - And just get every bucket you can find!\\
379 - You might want to hike up your pants.\\
380 - He's got another half hour of this.\\
381 - Good news, sir.\\
382 - It looks like Red Team's about to fold.\\
383 - Two squads have been captured,\\
384 - the others are pinned down here, here, and here.\\
385 - Okay, now we've just got to sneak the keys out of his purse.\\
386 - Test, test.\\
387 - Test, test.\\
388 - The microphone works.\\
389 - The chair is perfect,\\
390 - and your hair looks fine, sir.\\
391 - Can we proceed?\\
392 - Now then, Hal, we've heard a lot of testimony\\
393 - from people about what you've done at this company.\\
394 - Why don't you tell us in your own words\\
395 - what kind of an employee you were.\\
396 - Marginal.\\
397 - At best.\\
398 - Would you care to elaborate?\\
399 - When you work for a big, impersonal corporation\\
400 - like this...\\
401 - You know those nature shows\\
402 - where a wasp paralyzes a caterpillar,\\
403 - then injects it full of larvae?\\
404 - It stays alive for weeks,\\
405 - completely aware, feeling every little bite\\
406 - as the larvae devour it from the inside.\\
407 - I sat in a cubicle every day\\
408 - envying that caterpillar\\
409 - 'cause at least he got to be on TV.\\
410 - I hated that job.\\
411 - I was a crappy employee.\\
412 - And yet countless\\
413 - eyewitnesses paint you as a man at the center\\
414 - of an ingenious conspiracy.\\
415 - Shh-shh...\\
416 - Time and time again you were placed\\
417 - at a crucial event.\\
418 - Do you have any way of refuting these claims?\\
419 - Well, I didn't.\\
420 - Who could remember\\
421 - what they were doing on January 25, 2002\\
422 - or March 14, 2003?\\
423 - But my son figured something out.\\
424 - Stand up, Malcolm.\\
425 - I know he looks normal,\\
426 - but my son is a freaky genius with numbers.\\
427 - I'm telling you, his head should be\\
428 - the size of a medicine ball.\\
429 - You give him\\
430 - any day of any year, and he can tell you\\
431 - what day of the week it is.\\
432 - And what does that have to do with anything?\\
433 - Well, he figured out that every date on the board\\
434 - is a Friday.\\
435 - Every one. You can check the calendar.\\
436 - I'm sorry,\\
437 - I don't understand\\
438 - why that would be so important.\\
439 - I haven't shown up for work on a Friday in 15 years.\\
440 - He didn't show up on Fridays for 15 years!\\
441 - That isn't going to be on the record, is it?\\
442 - Do you have any evidence\\
443 - to back up this wild assertion?\\
444 - Well, yeah, once I knew what to look for,\\
445 - I realized I had almost everything I need\\
446 - right here in my memory box.\\
447 - The prosecution maintains\\
448 - that you handed the board of directors\\
449 - a set of cooked books on August 9.\\
450 - Yes, that's when I went to Bavaria Land.\\
451 - And when you were\\
452 - supposed to be hiding money\\
453 - offshore on December 6?\\
454 - I went to  The Nutcracker.\\
455 - Pretty good for a community college production.\\
456 - February 21.\\
457 - My driver's license\\
458 - from Grand Prix Go-Carts.\\
459 - June 27.\\
460 - Pilgrim Village.\\
461 - July 11.\\
462 - There was a ghost in my car.\\
463 - Right in my car.\\
464 - And finally,\\
465 - August 22.\\
466 - Well, I was chosen\\
467 - to be a junior trainer at Oceanland.\\
468 - He did all the work. I just stood there.\\
469 - Congratulations, Hal.\\
470 - Sorry about my little outburst there at the end.\\
471 - But they really should say\\
472 - "Innocent" instead of "Not guilty."\\
473 - It's confusing.\\
474 - Lois, we won the case.\\
475 - Now we can get\\
476 - our lives back to the way they were.\\
477 - You didn't work on Fridays?\\
478 - After all the sacrifices\\
479 - I made for this family.\\
480 - For 15 years\\
481 - I worked double shifts,\\
482 - drove carpool, cleaned the house\\
483 - while you were feeding Shamu!\\
484 - Actually, it's Keiko 2.\\
485 - He's smaller, but you get just as wet in the front row.\\
486 - It's a really good show. Let's...\\
487 - We should see it sometime.\\
488 - All right, let's get this over with.\\
489 - Red Team surrenders.\\
490 - Come on, Hendrix,\\
491 - you can put a little feeling into it.\\
492 - Yes, sir.\\
493 - That leaves us with the matter of the wager.\\
494 - I believe I can expect to see you\\
495 - bright and early tomorrow morning\\
496 - marching on the parade grounds\\
497 - wearing patent leather pumps and a bustier.\\
498 - Now, I've always\\
499 - favored red, but far be it from me\\
500 - to tell a lady how to dress.\\
501 - Captain,\\
502 - I suggest you surrender.\\
503 - If not, I have enough flour\\
504 - packed in this barrel to bake\\
505 - 500 cakes.\\
506 - All right, don't fire.\\
507 - We hereby surrender.\\
508 - Ah, what the hell.\\
509 - Things are finally back to normal.\\
510 - Well, except for the fact that Reese is still missing,\\
511 - Mom and Dad both don't have jobs,\\
512 - and we're $20,000 in debt.\\
513 - It's a letter from Reese.\\
514 - Oh, my God, he's joined the army.\\
515 - "Dear family, I'm fine.\\
516 - "I waited till I was a success to write to you.\\
517 - "I finished basic training at the top\\
518 - "of my class.\\
519 - "My drill sergeant told me\\
520 - I've earned some sort of reward."\\
521 - All right, gentlemen.\\
522 - We've entered Afghani airspace.\\
523 - We expect both hostile\\
524 - and friendly fire.\\
525 - The better you remember your training,\\
526 - the longer you will survive.\\
527 - On your feet!\\
528 - How soon do we land?\\
529 - Well, that's up to you.\\
530 - Remember, pull the green cord before the light green cord.
\section {Malcolm in the Middle Season 06}
\subsection {Episode 01: Reese Comes Home (3)}
1 - So, after I was indicted, my wife lost her job\\
2 - and had a nervous breakdown,\\
3 - and if that wasn't bad enough, one of our  sons stole his brother's girlfriend,\\
4 - which made him run away from home  and join the Army.\\
5 - We don't even know where he is.\\
6 - We've entered Afghani airspace.\\
7 - Remember, pull the green cord before the light green cord.\\
8 - We're just worried sick about him.\\
9 - It's just that you feel so helpless, you know?\\
10 - Look, I don't set the prices, mister. They're four bucks a box. Take it or leave it.\\
11 - All right. Just the Thin Mints.\\
12 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.01 - Reese Comes Home\\
13 - Synchronisation par Mark, Relecture par Tyno.\\
14 - Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com\\
15 - It doesn't have to be tuna surprise. It can be chicken surprise, or beef,\\
16 - but there will be a surprise involved.\\
17 - You know, we can wait for Mom to make dinner.\\
18 - I'm sorry, she went to talk with some Army administrator about Reese. She'll be gone for hours.\\
19 - Get your hands off me!  Your authority stops at my property line!\\
20 - What did she do?\\
21 - She completely destroyed an office,\\
22 - made explicit threats against the United States Army,\\
23 - attacked my groinage region and captured same.\\
24 - Listen, maybe there's a way we can make this whole thing go away.\\
25 - Sir, if she comes within 500 feet of my perimeter\\
26 - I've been given the authority to engage.\\
27 - - Mom, what happened? - I'll tell you what happened.\\
28 - I told them how my underage son ran away and joined  the Army under false pretenses and was sent off to combat\\
29 - and you know what they said?\\
30 - They said if you can find out what name he used, they can have him back to us in six months.\\
31 - Six months!\\
32 - They'll have him back to us in six months.\\
33 - I don't know if she's upset he's gonna get killed, or met someone else is gonna do it.\\
34 - - Honey, you know you're gonna lose a nail inside your palm again.  just calm down and let the Army... - I don't trust the Army,\\
35 - which means this family has to find him, and I don't trust this family, which means I have to find him.\\
36 - - Two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star? - And he blubbered like a baby.\\
37 - The Army. What do you expect of people who would give Reese a gun?\\
38 - Oh, that's right. It's the Army's fault if your brother gets killed.\\
39 - Now, Lois, we can't blame Malcolm for stealing Reese's girl and causing this whole mess in the first place.\\
40 - Kids his age are nothing but raging hormones and hideous self-involvement.\\
41 - They are all amoral little creeps.\\
42 - Don't defend him, Hal. Just help me make dinner.\\
43 - Great, "angry meat loaf". Thanks a lot.\\
44 - We don't have to worry about Reese.\\
45 - All he has to do is lay low and not do anything stupid.\\
46 - Oh, God.\\
47 - I'm a lean, mean fighting machine. I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.\\
48 - I'm a robot.\\
49 - Robots are cool.\\
50 - Green Lantern fought a robot.\\
51 - I love Green Lantern.\\
52 - I love pie.\\
53 - Pie...\\
54 - Pie...\\
55 - Pie...\\
56 - Why am I thinking about pie? I'm supposed to be thinking about something else.\\
57 - Does it rhyme with "pie"?\\
58 - Buy?\\
59 - Cry?\\
60 - Die?\\
61 - High?\\
62 - Pie?\\
63 - Pie!\\
64 - Pie?\\
65 - Green Lantern.\\
66 - Fighting robot.\\
67 - Fighting machine.\\
68 - Me...\\
69 - I'm a fighting machine.\\
70 - I'm a lean, mean fighting machine. I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.\\
71 - What is that?\\
72 - I made a list of every bad thing Reese ever did to me.\\
73 - A list?\\
74 - I'm sick of having to defend myself!\\
75 - No matter what I did to Reese, he's done way worse stuff to me, and it's all here on this list.\\
76 - So we're admitting we have lists?\\
77 - Mine starts January '95. When does yours start?\\
78 - October 3, 1996: my first knuckle pizza.\\
79 - July 10, 1997: my first atomic swirly.\\
80 - The big bruise of '99.\\
81 - "Backyard Dentist",\\
82 - "Lighter Fluid Donut". That's worse  than stealing a girlfriend, right?\\
83 - I don't know; were you in love for the first time with that donut?\\
84 - Shut up, Dewey. I had every right.\\
85 - In fact, I owe him.\\
86 - So you're saying if he dies, then you'll be even?\\
87 - I didn't say he was going to die!\\
88 - - Malcolm, he almost killed himself with Bisquick once. - I'm just saying he deserves whatever he gets.\\
89 - No, he doesn't.\\
90 - That's something Reese would say.\\
91 - I'm not Reese.\\
92 - Just because he's horrible doesn't mean I have to be. I'm better than that.\\
93 - Wow, for a brother-killer, you sure are conceited.\\
94 - Oh, uh, excuse me. Hi, uh, Sergeant Rick. I'm wondering if you can help me.\\
95 - My son is underaged, and  I think you may have recruited him.\\
96 - Take a look.\\
97 - - Oh, yeah, Private Jetson. - Oh! Yeah.\\
98 - Well, let's see, uh...\\
99 - He was sent to Fort Roberts. I'll get you the address.\\
100 - Oh, I really appreciate this. I just don't understand what would make him go and do a crazy thing like this.\\
101 - Well, the truth is is today's Army's a pretty attractive package. Competitive salaries, health benefits, college tuition...\\
102 - Lois, I didn't sign anything. Just hear me out.\\
103 - It's only two weekends a month, plus we might qualify for a housing allowance.\\
104 - Okay, there's a slight possibility of active duty, but Sergeant Rick expects global events to stabilize in the next three months.\\
105 - Excuse me?!\\
106 - What do you want?\\
107 - I'm Malcolm. I'm here Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3:00 to 7:00.\\
108 - No one volunteers here. They're all signing up for the glamorous jobs at the burn unit.\\
109 - I just want to do something to help veterans.\\
110 - Really? You think you can handle helping around here?\\
111 - How 'bout trying to give Mr. Skoros a sponge bath?\\
112 - Sure.\\
113 - Or maybe you'd prefer to clip Mr. Deepmarth toenails.\\
114 - Okay.\\
115 - Or how 'bout going room to room emptying bed pans and stanching bed sores?\\
116 - You know, I think I can save us both a little time here.\\
117 - This is how I see it playing out:\\
118 - you're keep thinking of worse and worse jobs for me to do, and you know what? I'm going to do them,\\
119 - all of them, no matter what.\\
120 - Why? It doesn't matter. I have my reasons.\\
121 - So go ahead, knock yourself out.\\
122 - Well, it kind of takes some of the fun out of it,\\
123 - but okay.\\
124 - You can start the afternoon enemas with Mr. Klegman.\\
125 - It'll be my pleasure.\\
126 - It's about my son, Reese.\\
127 - Um, I think you know him as Private Jetson.\\
128 - Private Jetson.\\
129 - Ma'am, let me shake your hand.\\
130 - That boy is oldier that this old dogface ever had the privilege of commanding.\\
131 - I wish I had a hundred more just like him. He's a fine boy.\\
132 - Yes, well...\\
133 - we think so, too.\\
134 - I'd be proud to help you in any way that I can. Now you just name it.\\
135 - The problem is he joined under false pretenses. He ran away; he's not even 18 years old yet.\\
136 - We need to know where he is so we can find him and bring him back home.\\
137 - I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't help you. That's classified.\\
138 - If your son were on a secret mission,\\
139 - which I'm not saying he is nor that one exists,\\
140 - it would compromise said mission\\
141 - if indeed there were one.\\
142 - My hands are tied.\\
143 - You know, Sergeant,\\
144 - you and I aren't so different.\\
145 - I mean, if you think about it, we both have the same job.\\
146 - Taking a bunch of mindless, irresponsible teenagers and turning them into something vaguely useful to the world.\\
147 - It is a challenge, ma'am.\\
148 - Last week, one of my boys was trying to iron his shirt while he was still in it.\\
149 - One of mine interrupted a war game because his rifle was kind of digging into his shoulder.\\
150 - - Did you make everyone suffer for what the one kid did? - Of course. But it never lasts, does it?\\
151 - - It is stunning how much punishment they require. - Tell me about it.\\
152 - I'm amazed I get anything else done.\\
153 - Did you ever try the opposite?\\
154 - - What do you mean? - Give one of them special privileges for no reason.\\
155 - - How does that work? - It's really pretty neat.\\
156 - The others don't know why he got special privileges so they start doing everything right just to catch up.\\
157 - Then the one you singled out starts getting suspicious and paranoid\\
158 - and he starts informing on the stragglers. - That sounds pretty good.\\
159 - - You mind if I steal that one? - Yeah, be my guest.\\
160 - You know another good one? Let them pick punishments for each other. It exercises their creativity and keeps them from ganging up on you.\\
161 - - Nice. - You can also take their breakfast, lunch and dinner, put it the blender and grind it up into a gray paste. Eventually, they eat it.\\
162 - That's kind of fun.\\
163 - - You are an artist. - No, I'm just a talented amateur.\\
164 - I wish I could help you.\\
165 - I wish I could just open this drawer up and show youthe information you need.\\
166 - But I can't.\\
167 - It's got me so frustrated that I just want to\\
168 - stare intently out this window for, oh, say...\\
169 - 120 seconds.\\
170 - - What is wrong with these guys? They're just like zombies. - It's the medication that makes them that way.\\
171 - - Except for Kowalski. I mean, he came to us like that. - Look, I don't think you should be giving them so much.\\
172 - I was reading to Donaldson for a half an hour, then a bee crawled out of his nose.\\
173 - Believe me, it's better for everyone to keep these men as calm as possible.\\
174 - Hey, Ed, you want to play?\\
175 - Here we go.\\
176 - You know what, Ed? You can do this.\\
177 - I believe in you, all right? I'm here to help you, however long it takes.\\
178 - Maybe you feel ignored here.\\
179 - Maybe you feel like you don't exist.\\
180 - I know you exist, Ed.\\
181 - Let me help you.\\
182 - Where have you been?\\
183 - You've been gone all day. You haven't called. I've been worried sick about you.\\
184 - Well, I have to eat, Lois.\\
185 - - I'm a human being. - I'm sorry I'm so late. I had to take the bus home.\\
186 - I sold the car.\\
187 - I bought a plane ticket to Kabul. There's $400 left.\\
188 - - I'd give it to you to pay down the Visa bill, but I need it for bribes. - What?!\\
189 - I'm gonna go get him.\\
190 - - What are you talking about? You can't just go get him. - Yes, I can.\\
191 - Tonight, I'm gonna buy enough frozen dinners to last you and the boys for three weeks. Then tomorrow, I'm flying to Kabul.\\
192 - If I don't get anywhere with the Army,  I'll hire an interpreter and get the locals to help me.\\
193 - If I have to, I'll make friends with a warlord. Those guys are pretty organized.\\
194 - I'll find him, Hal.\\
195 - And when does the little bird pop out of your head and start singing?\\
196 - This is what's happening, Hal.\\
197 - Lois,\\
198 - you can't do this.\\
199 - At some point, you have to check your ego and leave it to the professionals.\\
200 - - I can't. - Lois, you have this reckless, crazy belief in yourself that lets you do amazing things. It's something this family has always depended on.\\
201 - I would be lost without it, but sometimes that reckless, crazy belief is just, just...\\
202 - reckless and crazy!\\
203 - You've got to accept that some people can do things that you can't.\\
204 - Heart surgeons, rocket scientists, that lady at the mall who carves your name into a grain of rice.\\
205 - - How does she do that? - No one knows.\\
206 - Honey, honey, look...\\
207 - I am giving you permission not to be omnipotent. I know it's gonna be hard, but everything will be okay.\\
208 - I know it will.\\
209 - Sarsi or Diet Sarsi?\\
210 - I can't do it.\\
211 - I can't go on.\\
212 - Is this any way to start your morning?\\
213 - Mr. Waffles?\\
214 - Reese, you can't give up!\\
215 - You got to keep going.\\
216 - You got to keep trying.\\
217 - You don't know what I've been through.\\
218 - I've been shot at,\\
219 - chased,\\
220 - married,\\
221 - and when the guy found out I was a dude,\\
222 - it wasn't like a total deal breaker.\\
223 - Son, I know it's hard.\\
224 - Everything worth doing is hard.\\
225 - When third quarter profits were down, did Mr. Waffles give up?\\
226 - No, he did not.\\
227 - He put more lip-smacking delight in every bite!\\
228 - I don't think I can move.\\
229 - You have to move, Reese. You have to get home to your family and friends and your country.\\
230 - These people have no idea what breakfast is.\\
231 - They take rice from the night before and cook it up into a thin paste.\\
232 - Is that your idea of breakfast?\\
233 - No,\\
234 - but... - Do you ever want to taste my buttery goodness again?\\
235 - You know I do.\\
236 - Reese, listen to me. I now have 20% more blueberries in every box.\\
237 - My legs.\\
238 - They plump up in the batter!\\
239 - They're so juicy that way!\\
240 - I'm coming home!\\
241 - I'm proud of you, son.\\
242 - Whatever happened to Mrs. Waffles?\\
243 - - She was hot. - Yes, she was.\\
244 - But she didn't increase product awareness in girls 3 to 18 a single percent.\\
245 - Nurse Peterson,\\
246 - you'll be interested to know I took everyone's tranquilizers and flushed them down the toilet.\\
247 - - What? - I came here to help because I owe someone something,\\
248 - a soldier like these men.\\
249 - I didn't come here to stand by and do nothing while you crush their spirits with chemicals.\\
250 - - He deserved better, and they deserve better. - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
251 - You can't take these men off their sedatives.\\
252 - Oh, my God. Security!\\
253 - Guys, please calm down. Guys!\\
254 - - You've got to stop. - Come on, come on!\\
255 - You have to...\\
256 - Oh, I don't want to hear it.\\
257 - Isn't it bad enough with your mother gone and your brother missing? You have to go out brawling in the streets?\\
258 - - I'm sorry. - Yeah.\\
259 - Wait a minute. This is our dinner.\\
260 - Well, good news.\\
261 - God decided I don't deserve to redeem myself.\\
262 - I get to carry this soul-crushing guilt for the rest of my life.\\
263 - Yeah.\\
264 - I've been trying to compose a requiem for him.\\
265 - It's hard getting in the right mood using a glitter marker.\\
266 - - Maybe we've been trying to honor Reese the wrong way. - What do you mean?\\
267 - Reese wasn't into helping people and doing good deeds.\\
268 - He loved to smash stuff and destroy things for no reason.\\
269 - If we're gonna honor Reese,\\
270 - maybe we should think about doing it his way.\\
271 - You have something in mind?\\
272 - This kind of caught my eye.\\
273 - An art fair?\\
274 - Just think what Reese would have done with this.\\
275 - They've got drift wood art, yarn owls, dream catchers,\\
276 - face painting, folk dancing.\\
277 - They are kind of begging for it.\\
278 - I don't know.\\
279 - There's rapping grannies.\\
280 - Let me see that.\\
281 - Let me go, please! Come on. How was I supposed to know it was your god? It looked like a monkey man!\\
282 - You're gonna regret this! If my husband finds out, he'll make you pay.\\
283 - Then you'll really be sorry.\\
284 - Mom?\\
285 - Thank you so much. There you are.\\
286 - What in the name of God were you thinking?!\\
287 - Look at you. You are filthy.\\
288 - Your nails are a disgrace. You've been tomb robbing!\\
289 - Well, the fun stops now, young man!  You are in so much trouble!\\
290 - I just can't believe he could really be gone.\\
291 - I know.\\
292 - Wow, this diaper's got to be a five-pounder.\\
293 - I'd like to think Jamie knew what it was for.\\
294 - It's so weird.\\
295 - It seems like all my life I've wished for something horrible to happen to Reese,\\
296 - and now that it has I...\\
297 - - I... - Miss him?\\
298 - Yeah.\\
299 - I do, too.\\
300 - Remember when he shaved my eyebrows  and glued them back on so I looked permanently surprised?\\
301 - That was genius.\\
302 - Remember that look of pure joy he'd get on Christmas morning when he was smashing our presents?\\
303 - It's in my eyes!\\
304 - No matter how hard I tried,\\
305 - I could never make Mom's face turn that special purple color.\\
306 - Reese purple.\\
307 - Why couldn't I have said something meaningful to him before he...\\
308 - Don't do this to yourself.\\
309 - He would have liked this.\\
310 - I only wish he could have been here to see it.\\
311 - Me, too.\\
312 - Reese!\\
313 - You're not dead!\\
314 - I can't believe it. Reese, I'm so glad to see you.\\
315 - All right, all right. Don't 'mo me.\\
316 - How does this work?\\
317 - - Oh, well, we have the remote here, and you pick out a good one... - Here.\\
318 - We were saving this one.  It's from when Jamie had swine flu.\\
319 - Nice.\\
320 - God, I love this country.
\subsection {Episode 02: Busey's Run Away}
1 - Where the hell are my glasses?!\\
2 - I've been looking for... Where are they?!\\
3 - Are you sure you haven't seen them?\\
4 - - No. - Sorry, Dad.\\
5 - They gotta be right there somewhere.\\
6 - He's been looking for those glasses for two and a half hours.\\
7 - He's totally shattered his old record.\\
8 - This is ridiculous.\\
9 - They just disappear.\\
10 - Maybe they're in the car.\\
11 - Where the hell are my keys?!\\

15 - Give me back the deodorant.\\
16 - I haven't done the upper half of my body yet.\\
17 - No!\\
18 - This has to last us the whole month, and you're wasting it!\\
19 - I am not wasting it.\\
20 - You used up two inches of it drawing stick people having sex on the bathroom mirror!\\
21 - Would you two keep it down?\\
22 - Your father's talking with that man he interviewed with yesterday.\\
23 - Thank God one of us might finally have a job.\\
24 - No, no, I understand.\\
25 - He sounds like an excellent candidate.\\
26 - I would have hired him over me too.\\
27 - Right, his experience is more...\\
28 - Okay, he's much smarter...\\
29 - Right, more charismatic.\\
30 - Funny.\\
31 - I said quiet!\\
32 - And you.\\
33 - No.\\
34 - This is the last day in your Special Needs class.\\
35 - You have no idea\\
36 - how many hours I have spent trying to convince Mrs. Walsh that you are normal,\\
37 - so don't screw it up.\\
38 - Do you understand?\\
39 - Yes.\\
40 - Do you?\\
41 - Yes.\\
42 - Do you?\\
43 - Yes, Mom.\\
44 - Yes, he does have a better head of hair...\\
45 - No, I have no idea what he would like as a "Welcome to the Firm" gift...\\
46 - Okay, goodbye.\\
47 - Don't worry about it.\\
48 - There's got to be something I can get a job at.\\
49 - There's got to be a big turnover in Test Pilots.\\
50 - Or advertising. I can do advertising.\\
51 - Hal, you have no experience in advertising.\\
52 - I am a natural, little jingles are constantly popping into my head.\\
53 - A-Wham-Bam! Thank you, Jam.\\
54 - Who's gonna love it? Your family am.\\
55 - Banana skin, it's so nice and thin.\\
56 - There's no better way to keep your banana in.\\
57 - Hal...\\
58 - Newspaper, keeping track of your neighbourhood raper.\\
59 - Hal!\\
60 - Oh, I'm sorry, Lois.\\
61 - I just feel so useless, sitting around the house all day doing nothing.\\
62 - Well, then, how about taking Jamie to the park?\\
63 - You never get to do that.\\
64 - Yeah, you're right.\\
65 - I should enjoy him before he's old enough to be ashamed of me.\\
66 - And I think we should all be very happy for Dewey to be rejoining the Mainstream class.\\
67 - It's really quite an accomplishment,\\
68 - and I think a positive example for the rest\\
69 - of you that you don't have to be in here for the rest of your lives.\\
70 - There's always a chance to esca... get a transfer over.\\
71 - Okay, well, now it's time to say our goodbyes.\\
72 - If everyone would...\\
73 - We need you, Dewey.\\
74 - It's going to make the eyes stop following us.\\
75 - Things have gotten so much better since you got here.\\
76 - Chad hasn't bitten anything alive in weeks.\\
77 - I get off my motorcycle for lunch.\\
78 - You take care of us. You've got the microscope.\\
79 - And the beautiful view.\\
80 - Please, stay with us.\\
81 - It's not up to me.\\
82 - It's my Mom.\\
83 - Hug jail!\\
84 - Make him stay with a hug jail!\\
85 - Wow, you guys are huge! And, shiny.\\
86 - Thanks, mister.\\
87 - But we can always be huger.\\
88 - And shiner.\\
89 - You're out here all day?\\
90 - As long as those disability checks keep coming.\\
91 - Oh, no, no, no.\\
92 - What happened?\\
93 - My keys fell down the drain again.\\
94 - And my fingers are too titanically muscular\\
95 - to fit through the little metal stripes and rip  em out.\\
96 - Well, maybe we could punch the concrete around it into dust,\\
97 - and loosen the bars.\\
98 - Guys, you don't have to do that.\\
99 - Hang on.\\
100 - This'll work.\\
101 - Here.\\
102 - Give me your gum.\\
103 - Okay, but I've been chewing it all morning and it hasn't helped.\\
104 - He did it! Three cheers for the scrawny guy!\\
105 - Yeah! Hooray!\\
106 - Come on, Dewey, this is going to be great.\\
107 - You've seen fireworks before, and you've seen movies.\\
108 - You've never seen them together, at the same time.\\
109 - Let's get moving, I want to pay matinee prices.\\
110 - I don't feel like it. Go without me.\\
111 - Come on, we're trying to do something nice here,\\
112 - and reach out to you as a brother.\\
113 - Yeah, you don't have to worry, we're not setting you up.\\
114 - Are we?\\
115 - No.\\
116 - I just don't want to go, okay?\\
117 - Leave me alone.\\
118 - Bye hon, I'm off to the park.\\
119 - Oh, three days in a row.\\
120 - Yeah, you know what? It's great.\\
121 - It's giving me a new outlook on things.\\
122 - I'm sure Jamie's loving it.\\
123 - Oh, yeah.\\
124 - Jamie.\\
125 - We've only got two bottles of Baby Oil left,\\
126 - I'll pick up a case this afternoon.\\
127 - I think two of my fingers fused together.\\
128 - Great. That leaves eight for me to punish to the bone.\\
129 - Now, get moving. You better not be late for school.\\
130 - You hear me?\\
131 - And I want you home at three o'clock.\\
132 - Your homework better be finished or I'll set off some fireworks\\
133 - in a place a lot darker than a movie theatre.\\
134 - Have a nice day, honey.\\
135 - Aren't you going to warn me not to lose my milk money?\\
136 - Or that I better be polite to the crossing guard?\\
137 - No.\\
138 - There you go.\\
139 - Balanced to the penny.\\
140 - The problem is, you weren't adding the check amount,\\
141 - you were adding your address over and over.\\
142 - I thought that number had a lot of words in it. Thanks, Hal.\\
143 - You see, it's not that difficult, guys.\\
144 - And remember for next time, the stamp\\
145 - goes on the letter, not the mailbox.\\
146 - Is that the thing firemen use?\\
147 - No, that's a hydrant.\\
148 - Remember the "no parking" stump?\\
149 - Oh, yeah.\\
150 - Oh, I gotta go.\\
151 - I promised Lois I'd stop by the market on the way home.\\
152 - Oh, you had a good day, didn't you, honey?\\
153 - Hey, did you like when Carlo threw you way, way up in the air?\\
154 - And Daddy was screaming, wasn't he?\\
155 - Guys, don't worry, I'll be back tomorrow.\\
156 - Useless peace of junk!\\
157 - Good night, honey.\\
158 - I made you a turkey and cream cheese sandwich for school tomorrow.\\
159 - What are you trying to do?\\
160 - Mom hasn't made you do any of the crap she's made us do.\\
161 - Why is she being so nice to you?\\
162 - Because, for the last 3 days, I haven't done anything wrong.\\
163 - You see,\\
164 - Mom doesn't yell and scream at us because it's the only way she knows how to talk.\\
165 - She does it because we do stuff that's bad.\\
166 - And if you don't do anything, she doesn't get mad at you.\\
167 - You understand?\\
168 - It's not her. It's us.\\
169 - Fine, don't tell us.\\
170 - Well, that's strange.\\
171 - For some reason, I'm taking 1/3 less Asprin than usual.\\
172 - Why are you pacing?\\
173 - Let me ask you something, Lois.\\
174 - What would you do if, hypothetically,\\
175 - there were a series of unforeseeable circumstances,\\
176 - you found yourself commanding an army of benevolent strong men?\\
177 - What?\\
178 - Picture it.\\
179 - A dozen guys, any one of  em can rip a horse in half,\\
180 - willing to follow your every command.\\
181 - I'd have to do something really great with that,\\
182 - something noble and unselfish, but not too expensive.\\
183 - And we are not even taking into account that I could easily be led to the dark side.\\
184 - Lois, you have to promise me.\\
185 - If you ever see me holding a cat and laughing maniacally over a globe,\\
186 - you need to let me know.\\
187 - After this, I'll show you how to play Gin Rummy.\\
188 - That's always been mama's favourite game.\\
189 - Okay.\\
190 - So, Dewey, do you like being back in the normal class?\\
191 - Hello.\\
192 - Mrs Walsh, what a surprise.\\
193 - You're here to check up on Dewey,\\
194 - I can assure you that he's just as normal and wonderful as...\\
195 - No, actually, I just came to find out if Dewey's heard from any\\
196 - of the children from the special needs class.\\
197 - No, why?\\
198 - Well, uh, seems they've run away.\\
199 - All of them?\\
200 - The whole class ran away?\\
201 - They just disappeared.\\
202 - Dewey, do you know anything about this?\\
203 - Okay, well,\\
204 - thank you, and if you hear anything, please let me know.\\
205 - I'll see ya.\\
206 - Oh, those kids.\\
207 - I'm so glad you're out of that class.\\
208 - You know what?\\
209 - I think I'm going to bake you some cookies.\\
210 - What are you doing?\\
211 - We couldn't take it any more.\\
212 - It's horrible without you.\\
213 - We're never going back.\\
214 - This is our new home.\\
215 - They'll never find us here.\\
216 - It's perfect.\\
217 - We took blankets,\\
218 - and we stole some food from the dumpster outside some restaurant.\\
219 - We can't think any more. What we're doing, Dewey.\\
220 - You thought I'd steal food from the trash and\\
221 - tell 20 kids to run away and live in the trees forever?\\
222 - Oh, maybe.\\
223 - But you can't stay up here.\\
224 - People are looking for you.\\
225 - Mrs Walsh came to my house.\\
226 - We're never going home.\\
227 - You come live with us.\\
228 - The sqirrels will have to vote you in, but I'll put in a good word.\\
229 - No! This is crazy.\\
230 - I'm not living up here, and neither are you.\\
231 - I'm sorry, but I'm telling.\\
232 - You're not telling anyone.\\
233 - Do you realise how much trouble you'd get in?\\
234 - What are you talking about, I didn't...\\
235 - Zoe.\\
236 - We didn't want to do it.\\
237 - It was Dewey's idea.\\
238 - The whole thing.\\
239 - He tricked us into it.\\
240 - Why did you make us do this, Dewey?\\
241 - Dewey, come get your cookies,\\
242 - while the chocolate chips are still warm and melty!\\
243 - We've lost Dewey.\\
244 - It's the only possible explanation.\\
245 - He's turned on us, and he's feeding Mom information.\\
246 - This is bad.\\
247 - Real bad.\\
248 - I know. What does he have on you?\\
249 - Oh, man.\\
250 - I have all kinds of things going on he might know about.\\
251 - I have my lost dog scam, the rat baby farm.\\
252 - The electrified mailbox I'm noodling with.\\
253 - We don't have any choice.\\
254 - We have to neutralize him.\\
255 - Yeah, but how?\\
256 - Okay, we let him overhear something we're planning.\\
257 - Something way across town.\\
258 - We make it so juicy and harmless-sounding,\\
259 - he won't be able to resist telling Mom.\\
260 - So, she waits in the cold for three or four hours,\\
261 - and when nothing happens, he's lost all his credibility.\\
262 - Nice.\\
263 - Ready to go to the sewerage treatment plant and do some unwanted vandalism?\\
264 - Yes, I've got the shovels and\\
265 - the flares for the senseless destruction we've got planned.\\
266 - I sure hope Mom doesn't ever find out.\\
267 - Oh, don't worry about Mom. She's too stupid.\\
268 - And besides, she's probably busy stuffing her fat face.\\
269 - I sure hope Mom doesn't ever find out you said that.\\
270 - By the way, do you think she's gotten stupider or fatter?\\
271 - Good question. I'd say...\\
272 - All right honey, I'm going to the park.\\
273 - Oh, I hate ab days. They keep pulling me in to judge.\\
274 - All I know, is somebody's tummy is not going to be as flat as somebody else's,\\
275 - and somebody's going to end up crying.\\
276 - Look at this, Hal, they still haven't found those kids.\\
277 - You're kidding.\\
278 - This is terrible. Where could they be?\\
279 - All those kids are such messes, they don't know how to take care of themselves.\\
280 - Someone has to help them.\\
281 - Someone will help them, Lois.\\
282 - As a matter of fact, I think someone's gonna help the crap out of those kids.\\
283 - Okay, Dewey, our next pizza delivery comes with a free collectible cap.\\
284 - This has to stop!\\
285 - I haven't slept in four days! You guys have to come down!\\
286 - Why, it's going great.\\
287 - Going great?\\
288 - You guys are on milk cartons!\\
289 - This is serious now.\\
290 - Everyone's looking for you.\\
291 - The cops, your parents.\\
292 - Shiny giants in Speedos.\\
293 - Doesn't matter.\\
294 - We have a better life up here.\\
295 - The fairies take care of us.\\
296 - Mom's right, I do have crazy eyes.\\
297 - It's going to be winter soon.\\
298 - The leaves are going to fall off the trees.\\
299 - People will be able to see you!\\
300 - We've thought of that. We're gonna head south.\\
301 - There's a string of trees along Highway 8.\\
302 - We may lose a few kids to predators and stuff,\\
303 - but they'll know they died free.\\
304 - Okay, guys, drink a little, but keep moving.\\
305 - I guess we should go back out again.\\
306 - Dad,\\
307 - when you've finished watering you men, can I ask you something?\\
308 - Well, go ahead, son. What is it?\\
309 - I've got this decision to make.\\
310 - There's a lot of people depending on me, and I'm not sure what to do.\\
311 - That's the part of leadership no-one talks about, son.\\
312 - You think it's gonna be all parades,\\
313 - and strong men carrying you around in one of those fancy Sultan do-dads.\\
314 - But what they don't tell you about, is the crushing responsibility.\\
315 - Men who expect nothing in return, but\\
316 - an able general, who could lead them to victory.\\
317 - And instead, you break their hearts.\\
318 - Men,\\
319 - I've been wasting your time.\\
320 - You deserve better than me.\\
321 - I've let you down.\\
322 - You haven't let us down.\\
323 - We've let you down.\\
324 - You're the smartest man in the world, and we let you down.\\
325 - It's all our fault.\\
326 - We're weak.\\
327 - Weak.\\
328 - Weak little girls.\\
329 - Does this mean I'm a daddy?\\
330 - Hero?\\
331 - I wouldn't say hero.\\
332 - But you can, if you want.\\
333 - I just don't understand, I mean,\\
334 - what on earth could have possibly possessed you children to do this?\\
335 - What do you expect?\\
336 - We're creepy.\\
337 - Yeah, we are.\\
338 - Well, I think the first thing we have to do is eliminate\\
339 - the things that get you over-excited.\\
340 - I think maybe your recess time might be what put you over the edge.\\
341 - Wait, they didn't mean to get everyone so upset.\\
342 - They just wanted...\\
343 - Thank you, Dewey, it's really not your concern any more.\\
344 - It was nice while it lasted.\\
345 - What do you mean, not my concern?\\
346 - How come nobody even cares about any of my concerns?\\
347 - Dewey, what are you doing?\\
348 - I've got so much feelings running through my head,\\
349 - and I can't get any of them straight,\\
350 - and they're pounding, and they're pounding!\\
351 - And they're after my ***!\\
352 - The kid's gotta do some work out on his labs.\\
353 - Dewey, knock it off! Stop it this instant!\\
354 - I hate it! And the people!\\
355 - And the people, and the hands!\\
356 - He's normally not like this!\\
357 - I think it might be best for everyone if\\
358 - Dewey goes back into the special needs class.\\
359 - Just for a while.\\
360 - See you later, honey.\\
361 - I'm going to the park.\\
362 - Hal, it's that job you interviewed for last week.\\
363 - They saw you on TV, I think they want to hire you.\\
364 - Hello?\\
365 - Thank you.\\
366 - Well, sure I can.\\
367 - Thank you.\\
368 - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!\\
369 - Oh, thank God, I can't believe it.\\
370 - I know, me too.\\
371 - I was starting to worry that neither of us was going to find a job.\\
372 - I thought you were going to spend the rest of your life in the park.\\
373 - Okay, men, quiet down, I have some important news I have to tell you.\\
374 - I... got a job.\\
375 - That means I'll be going to work during the day.\\
376 - Which means I won't be coming to the park any more.\\
377 - Oh, no.\\
378 - Not coming to the park?\\
379 - We need you, Hal.\\
380 - What are we going to do without you?\\
381 - I'm gonna miss you, too.\\
382 - This past week has been one of the best of my life.\\
383 - And you'll be fine, I promise.\\
384 - Well, Eddie, look at you. Using that ATM like old pro!\\
385 - I swear, you've been doing it all your life.\\
386 - And you, Marcus.\\
387 - Who's taping Guiding Light and watching it with dinner?\\
388 - I know who! And the rest of you guys.\\
389 - You're amazing.\\
390 - Every one of you.\\
391 - Ah, you greasy goots.\\
392 - We'll never forget you, Hal.\\
393 - You did so much for us, I wish we could pay you back somehow.\\
394 - Yeah.\\
395 - Oh, hi. Today's my first day, I'm not sure where to go.\\
396 - Oh, it's okay.\\
397 - They're with me.

147 - Yes\\
148 - We could go both\\
149 - Not you think? you gave yourself so much trouble to deny our family relationship\\
150 - No it is not at all what I've done\\
151 - I'm not a little boy I distinguish between what happens to us\\
152 - and what happens at work\\
153 - Ah I see so you can deny all these principles as it is done for money\\
154 - That's mom, for the damn money. I gave up all morality and decided to go to hell for $ 6 / hour\\
155 - You know very well that this pub is absolutely ignoble\\
156 - No it is not that much\\
157 - This is a picture of a guy with a broom and pack of beer\\
158 - types that sweep often drink beer\\
159 - and guys who drink beer are often sweepers\\
160 - Dopey?\\
161 - It has tripled sales of non-alcoholic beers, that's incredible\\
162 - When I think I raised a son who became insensitive to what are currently the most important\\
163 - If I became insensitive to force it to model you\\
164 - Stop both, appointment the unbreathable atmosphere\\
165 - Come on Greg\\
166 - I think it's nice to take pains to organize our poker night, it impresses these tons of garbage in front of you,\\
167 - draw back before you do anything\\
168 - Even these chips have an amazing flavor\\
169 - Who distributed this rotten game? I want to be thrown out\\
170 - I do not know what to do if I give up now, What image of me will I give to my son?\\

180 - That way you can explain why you are want to store as\\
181 - I do not like it especially it's my head that I asked to install\\
182 - You said yourself that it was not so disgusting it\\
183 - Perhaps you can explain to everyone here how this thing is not racist\\
184 - First they pick their cotton and now we must be used to support their moral dilemmas.\\
185 - This is probably the most distressing aspect of the enormous impact that racism had on white\\
186 - How son and white mothers will have yet tear before we have finally understood\\
187 - Already that we have to dance together at weddings\\
188 - and they are looking to shake their big soft buttocks\\
189 - Enough now I need your support, you must admit that it is a clich  representation of African-American man!\\
190 - You want to know what you really not stand?\\
191 - It's not what you think I'm biased, is having to accept that I do not work you obey the finger and the eye\\
192 - and as I grow gradually you lose all your authority over me\\
193 - you can not stand the idea that one day I am free\\
194 - I have a dream\\
195 - Sing my brother sings\\
196 - You want to talk about what disturbs you deeply?\\
197 - Is that in the background you know that it is I who am right\\
198 - you also have a moral sense that you simply try to deny\\
199 - How dare you talk about morality\\
200 - While you use this trick to me ridicule in front of friends Dad?\\
201 - Is what I told him that you think he realized he ridiculed\\
202 - and he would drop this showdown stupid with the garbage? I told him?\\
203 - And well no!\\
204 - because even if I want it to death I will always treat with a modicum of respect\\
205 - I will realize that I am ridiculed?\\
206 - Hal it has nothing to do!\\
207 - If you stay in it, enough stop. Why do you continue to fighting? This is a very pleasant evening.\\

230 - Ok\\
231 - It's not stealing, it's just a loan. It's not stealing, it's just a loan.\\
232 - It begins with the garbage of our lawns, is complete with a container of the hospital and we will make a visit to a garbage\\
233 - Dogs and they will come out?\\
234 - They wake up in half an hour ... with a slight headache\\
235 - If only you d ployais much determination and perseverance in your studies, you can become ... oh no you've missed the boat\\

239 - Tell me Greg, you Differencies right from wrong?\\
240 - I do not understand what you mean\\
241 - Say that there is a thing to you to do and you hoping someone else would\\

253 - What are you doing?\\
254 - I put it back in its place\\
255 - Really?\\
256 - I am always ready to recognize my wrongs\\

259 - what matters is that I want him to stay here,\\
260 - must stay here!\\
261 - Talk about something, now I'm to remove\\
262 - It's true look at that\\
263 - We live in what time it is called Dopey is the great delusion\\
264 - But if I remove it believe that it is through pure spirit of contradiction\\
265 - I am a spirit of contradiction?\\
266 - No, I find it completely shocking thing\\
267 - I really do and I did not know before because I was damn upset, unless it or otherwise ...\\

30 - Reese, give her a break.\\
31 - Why? We live in just as big a stink-hole as she does.\\
32 - Where do we get to escape to?\\
33 - Reese, you're right.\\
34 - This is your house.\\
35 - If you don't want to watch it, you can get up and change it.\\
36 - Nice try.\\
37 - Dad, I need some help with my homework.\\
38 - I don't think so, Dewey.\\
39 - I put in all this time and effort, then you just have\\
40 - Malcolm correct everything after I go to bed.\\
41 - I can't do this with Malcolm.\\
42 - I'm supposed to do a 300-word report on how you're my personal hero.\\

45 - Dad, don't freak out.\\
46 - We had to pick one of our parents.\\
47 - Can I just watch you for a while?\\
48 - Sure. As a matter of fact, you can help me with my project.\\
49 - What are you doing?\\
50 - Well, you know that jerk across the street who's always got it in for me?\\
51 - Parking jerk or lawn mower jerk?\\
52 - Huh? No, Christmas jerk! Bill Rendall.\\
53 - Every year that guy waits to see what decorations I put out\\
54 - and then finds a way to top me.\\
55 - I string lights, he strings better lights.\\
56 - I put out Frosty, he puts out an elf village.\\
57 - I put out Dracula, he does nothing and I look like a jackass!\\
58 - I mean, what kind of sick mind uses a religious holiday as a weapon?\\
59 - Wait. Which one is call-the-cops jerk?\\
60 - That's like four of them.\\
61 - Anyway, I decided to let Rendall have\\
62 - his precious little Christmas victory if it's so damned important to him.\\
63 - Okay.\\
64 - I'm doing Pearl Harbor Day instead.\\
65 - What?\\
66 - Pearl Harbor Day.\\
67 - December 7, 1941.\\
68 - The opening shot of the Second World War.\\
69 - I am going to build a spectacular tribute to those courageous soldiers.\\
70 - It's going to be beautiful and dignified and uplifting...\\
71 - and it's gonna be all mine.\\
72 - Want to help?\\
73 - Yeah. It sounds fun.\\
74 - Are you really gonna put up a formation of flying zombies?\\
75 - Nah. I just drew them' cause it looked cool.\\
76 - Jessica, your pasta recipe is terrific.\\
77 - Look at us, eating healthy for once.\\
78 - Reese, you want some more?\\
79 - No.\\
80 - She took over the TV, now she's taking over dinner?\\
81 - This isn't even food.\\
82 - Reese, it's just low-fat.\\
83 - And if you knew anything at all about food,\\
84 - you'd know that fats and oils are the vehicles by which flavor travels.\\
85 - Fat is what makes things taste good.\\
86 - That's why a wise and loving God created fat in the first place.\\
87 - She is a guest in our home, and I think it's delicious.\\
88 - She can make me take it, but she can't make me eat it.\\
89 - Do you think we should cut up some of these guys\\
90 - so there's more body parts floating in the water?\\
91 - Nah, that's a little gruesome.\\
92 - Just melt them with a lighter.\\
93 - Okay, I have a little announcement to make.\\
94 - You know how last year, with the conspiracy trial\\
95 - and your father and me losing our jobs, we ended up $20, 000 in debt.\\
96 - Yeah?\\
97 - Well, after six months of scrimping and saving and going up to $28, 000 in debt,\\
98 - we are now down $26, 000 in debt!\\
99 - Look out world, we're back!\\
100 - I know how much you boys have sacrificed, kicking in your paychecks\\
101 - and working extra shifts, and, well, we thought you guys deserved a reward.\\
102 - Really?\\
103 - This is great.\\
104 - I thought she was going to start charging us for water.\\
105 - So, your dad and I are taking the whole family,\\
106 - and Jessica, to see...\\
107 - a musical!\\
108 - A what?\\
109 - A musical.\\
110 - From Broadway.\\
111 - It's called Mamma Mia.\\
112 - They take all those old ABBA songs\\
113 - like "Dancing Queen," and "Fernando," and stick some story in between.\\
114 - Oh, my God, you're serious.\\
115 - Six partially obstructed seats.\\
116 - At first I thought of treating you boys to a rock concert\\
117 - or Motocross or something like that,\\
118 - but then Jessica told me about this and I thought this sounded perfect.\\
119 - Wow! I mean, I just mentioned it'cause it was interesting.\\
120 - I didn't think you were gonna take me.\\
121 - What a nice surprise.\\
122 - I need your Calculus notes.\\
123 - I couldn't listen to a word Mr. Jacobson was saying in that stupid golf shirt.\\
124 - How can a man have nipples that big?\\
125 - What?\\
126 - You can hang out here if you need to get away from your dad,\\
127 - but don't act like we're friends, okay?\\
128 - Why are you mad at me?\\
129 - Because I stick up for you all the time.\\
130 - You turn around and manipulate my mom into doing something only you want to do.\\
131 - Wait. You're talking about the show?\\
132 - Let me explain something to you, Jessica.\\
133 - My family doesn't have fun.\\
134 - We aren't nice.\\
135 - And the one time Mom actually does do something nice, you hijack it for your own...\\
136 - I didn't do it for me, I did it for Reese.\\
137 - What does Reese have to do with it?\\
138 - You know what he has to do with it.\\
139 - No, I don't.\\
140 - Please tell me you're kidding.\\
141 - About what?\\
142 - Oh, my God.\\
143 - You honestly don't know.\\
144 - You are actually so self-involved and narcissistic that you can't even see it.\\
145 - See what?\\
146 - You know what, Malcolm?\\
147 - Why don't you try to go for maybe two seconds\\
148 - without thinking about yourself and see what you notice?\\
149 - Stop insulting me.\\
150 - What the hell are you talking about?\\
151 - And it never even occurred to you to wonder why Reese is so angry all the time?\\
152 - Why he acts like such a jerk?\\
153 - Because he's a jerk.\\
154 - That's right. Just because he's your brother\\
155 - doesn't mean you should put any thought into it.\\
156 - He couldn't possibly be dealing with anything weird and confusing.\\
157 - He couldn't possibly be afraid to admit that he wanted\\
158 - to go see a musical because you'd make fun of him.\\
159 - Of course I'd make fun of him.\\
160 - What kind of guy wants to see a Broadway musical?\\
161 - Yes, Malcolm.\\
162 - What kind of a guy does want to go see a Broadway musical?\\
163 - Come on.\\
164 - Maybe you're not being selfish.\\
165 - Maybe you're just too scared where it leads if you think\\
166 - about how much he fusses over his hair and his body and his gourmet cooking.\\
167 - Some people just don't want to see what's right in front of their faces.\\
168 - Nuh-uh.\\
169 - Look, maybe I'm butting in where I don't belong, but you're his brother,\\
170 - and he should at least be able to count on you for support.\\
171 - Thanks a lot for sticking us with that stupid show.\\
172 - I didn't do it for me, I did it for your brother.\\
173 - Malcolm's gay?\\
174 - I knew it!\\
175 - Wow! Look at it go, huh?\\
176 - They may have been responsible for one of the most devastating\\
177 - attacks in American history, but by God, they make good toy.\\
178 - Is that what I think it is?\\
179 - Dad, it's not really...\\
180 - I'm just gonna take a little peek.\\
181 - "My Dad, My Hero."\\
182 - I might have jazzed it up a little.\\
183 - Dewey, everything in this report is just made up.\\
184 - Every word of it.\\
185 - I... I never did any of this stuff.\\
186 - Are you sure? I could've sworn Mom said something\\
187 - about you giving your parachute to an orphan in midair.\\
188 - You are not going to turn in a paper full of lies.\\
189 - But, Dad, it's due on Tuesday!\\
190 - You're just gonna have to find another way.\\
191 - Let me explain something about heroism, son.\\
192 - There are all kinds of bravery in the world.\\
193 - All kinds.\\
194 - You don't have to be a Special Forces Ranger\\
195 - or fight crime in a cape to be a hero.\\
196 - There's the unsung bravery of the common man.\\
197 - Normal people who prove their courage every day,\\
198 - by standing up for their families or...\\
199 - being decent to other people and...\\
200 - Is it bleeding?\\
201 - Hey.\\
202 - Hey!\\
203 - You want half?\\
204 - I'll fix my own.\\
205 - Peanut butter's good, too.\\
206 - Nothing wrong with having peanut butter.\\
207 - What?\\
208 - Just because I'm having ham doesn't mean you have to have ham.\\
209 - Just because we're brothers doesn't mean\\
210 - we have to enjoy the same thing, right?\\
211 - Exactly.\\
212 - Everybody's different.\\
213 - It'd be stupid if I tried to force you to like something I liked.\\
214 - Right. Plus, it wouldn't work anyway.\\
215 - People can't help what they like.\\
216 - That's just the way they're born.\\
217 - I know. Like me, I've never liked... ham.\\
218 - Really? 'Cause maybe if you tried it...\\
219 - No. But that's me.\\
220 - I'm not putting it down or anything.\\
221 - I hear you.\\
222 - There's no...\\
223 - right sandwich.\\
224 - So, um... the ABBA thing...\\
225 - Should be great.\\
226 - Yeah, absolutely.\\
227 - Just great.\\
228 - Hey.\\
229 - Have a good snack.\\
230 - You, too.\\
231 - Hal, you have to get ready.\\
232 - The show starts in an hour, and we still have to drop Jamie off on the way.\\
233 - Almost done. Hey, have you seen Dewey around?\\
234 - I promised him he could fire-bomb the Utah.\\
235 - He's doing schoolwork.\\
236 - It was so sweet.\\
237 - He told me this afternoon he's writing a 300-word report about how I'm his hero.\\
238 - What a wonderful night!\\
239 - How could they say the theater is dead when a spectacle like that\\
240 - is being bused all over the country?\\
241 - Yeah, who knew you could use the same three chords\\
242 - over and over and people would sit through it for two hours?\\
243 - You can be Mr. Fancy Pants music snob if you like, but everyone else loved it.\\
244 - Thank you for including me.\\
245 - I had so much fun.\\
246 - Yeah, me, too.\\
247 - I especially liked the part where the father\\
248 - was stabbed in the back by his son.\\
249 - That wasn't in the show, Hal.\\
250 - Well, I saw it somewhere.\\
251 - I'm glad you boys liked it so much.\\
252 - I've never seen you like this.\\
253 - You didn't stop smiling at each other all night.\\
254 - How could you not love a show like that?\\
255 - Yeah, nothing creepy about it at all.\\
256 - You guys want to listen to the CD again?\\
257 - Again?\\
258 - Oh, yeah. Love ABBA.\\
259 - I could listen to it forever.\\
260 - ...and then I said, "You keep your sexist, adolescent humor\\
261 - to yourself, Your Honor."\\
262 - Let's just say two days of picking up trash on the freeway never felt so good.\\
263 - Wow, all these great stories:\\
264 - the judge, those bikers...\\
265 - I don't know any other way to say this, Mom, but you're kind of a... bad-ass.\\
266 - You know I don't appreciate that kind of language.\\
267 - If anyone cares, I'll be in the garage alone, commemorating our heroic\\
268 - stand against a heartless, back-stabbing, traitorous attack.\\
269 - Okay, hon.\\
270 - Then there was this time at the store with this huge shoplifter and he...\\
271 - Beautiful Bianca is ready to make\\
272 - the Fashionistas swoon in her flowing crepe jumpsuit...\\
273 - This is nice.\\
274 - What'd you think of the Versace?\\
275 - Well, it has a nice drape, and it seems like a...\\
276 - kicky look for fall.\\
277 - Yeah, I think it's...\\
278 - yummy.\\
279 - Okay, you know what?\\
280 - This is stupid.\\
281 - We have to talk about this.\\
282 - Right.\\
283 - I mean, just because it's weird doesn't mean we can't handle it.\\
284 - We're brothers.\\
285 - Right. We've been through everything together.\\
286 - We shouldn't be pussy footing around about it.\\
287 - I got you something.\\
288 - Hey, I got you something.\\
289 - Really? See, this is what I'm talking about.\\
290 - We're being open and supportive and honest with each other.\\
291 - Here.\\
292 - What's this?\\
293 - It's called "If You're Gay, It's Okay."\\
294 - It's full of great resources.\\
295 - What's this?\\
296 - Naughty Pool Boys III.\\
297 - I watched ten or 12 of these,\\
298 - and this one seems to have the most stuff you guys like.\\
299 - Wait.\\
300 - I'm not gay. You're gay.\\
301 - No, I'm not. You are.\\
302 - I'm not gay.\\
303 - Malcolm, check out what they're doing in that movie,\\
304 - and then tell me you're not gay.\\
305 - No, this is...\\
306 - She said...\\
307 - Oh, my God!\\
308 - You plan, you hope, but you never think it's going turn out this good!\\
309 - Stop laughing.\\
310 - I don't think I can!\\
311 - When you guys were dancing, and you did that little...\\
312 - Oh, my God, it was so sweet!\\
313 - There's nothing more I can ask for, honestly.\\
314 - You guys make me so happy!\\
315 - Oh, God, it hurts!\\
316 - Well, I better go drag my dad off the lawn.\\
317 - He likes to fall asleep right next to the toilet.\\
318 - See you guys at dinner.\\
319 - Vendetta.\\
320 - How could she be so...?\\
321 - Vendetta!\\
322 - Yes, vendetta.\\
323 - Reese, I promise, we'll get back at her.\\
324 - But we have to be careful.\\
325 - She's got Mom totally on her side.\\
326 - Oh, yeah.\\
327 - It's tricky.\\
328 - Somehow, we've got to figure out a way to turn Mom against her.\\
329 - Okay, got it.\\
330 - What?\\
331 - It's a little risky, but I'll tell you one thing.\\
332 - No one calls me gay and gets away with it!\\
333 - Wow.\\
334 - Dad, it's beautiful.\\
335 - Well, I did what I could on my own.\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - Sorry.\\
338 - Then he accused me of loving Mom more than him\\
339 - just because I wouldn't slash her boyfriend's tires.\\
340 - I'm so sorry, honey.\\
341 - Parents shouldn't put their kids in the middle.\\
342 - Or hit on their friends.\\
343 - Boys, come get the groceries.\\
344 - I hope this means we can eat soon.\\
345 - Hold it.\\
346 - What's that?\\
347 - What?\\
348 - That.\\
349 - A turtleneck.\\
350 - What do you care?\\
351 - You don't wear turtlenecks.\\
352 - Can I just get the groceries so we can eat?\\
353 - I've got a ton of homework...\\
354 - Aha!\\
355 - Mom, don't!\\
356 - Who gave you that?\\
357 - None of your business!\\
358 - What is your problem, anyway?\\
359 - Can't you go five seconds without butting into my life?\\
360 - What?\\
361 - It wasn't her, Mom!\\
362 - I swear!\\
363 - You always think you know everything, but you're wrong!\\
364 - You're dead wrong this time!\\
365 - I think you and I need to have a little talk.\\
366 - But I...\\
367 - Come on.\\
368 - When your mom comes out,\\
369 - she's gonna want to know what I said to you about this.\\
370 - Make up something good.\\
371 - He did it to me again.\\
372 - I suppose you have a good explanation for this.\\
373 - Not really.\\
374 - Lois, I'm sorry.\\
375 - I'm not going to lie to you.\\
376 - I gave him the hickey to keep him from doing something really stupid.\\
377 - Excuse me?\\
378 - I'm not saying I was smart either, but...\\
379 - There's this girl that Malcolm's been chasing, and she's really bad news.\\
380 - She's sexually active and I'm pretty sure she's into drugs,\\
381 - and the only reason why he's interested in her\\
382 - is because he's so insecure about himself.\\
383 - We got into this fight and I was saying that\\
384 - he could do so much better and he said that nobody liked him anyway,\\
385 - and I was telling him that a lot of girls liked him\\
386 - because he's sweet and cute and funny, and then\\
387 - he kinda grabbed me and we started kissing\\
388 - and I couldn't stop because then he would think\\
389 - I was making the whole thing up and...\\
390 - I'm sorry.\\
391 - I didn't know what else to do.\\
392 - Wow, that's a pretty convincing lie for just winging it.\\
393 - I mean, you went a little overboard with the crying, but the basic story was good.\\
394 - Drug girl was a nice touch.\\
395 - Creepy, a little sad.\\
396 - But how did you...?\\
397 - Sweetie, I'm a mother.\\
398 - It's my business to know.\\
399 - You've got talent, but I turned pro 20 years ago.\\
400 - Which isn't to say you haven't been useful.\\
401 - I never would've been able to enjoy that play in peace\\
402 - if the boys weren't occupied.\\
403 - And the gay thing was very entertaining.\\
404 - But more important, those two idiots actually\\
405 - treated each other decently for a few days.\\
406 - Thank you for that.\\
407 - So, here's the deal.\\
408 - As of today, you are banned from this house.\\
409 - You violated my trust.\\
410 - I don't want you around my boys.\\
411 - Knowing that, they will automatically forgive you and sneak you back in.\\
412 - You will be here every day after school until 6:00, except Thursdays when I work until 9:30.\\
413 - You will have complete run of the house, but\\
414 - I want Reese to do his half hour of assigned reading\\
415 - and Malcolm to complete all his college applications, not just the Ivy Leagues.\\
416 - And no junk food.\\
417 - Understood?\\
418 - For how long?\\
419 - We'll see.\\
420 - "Ice Capades" are coming in a few months.\\
421 - Sure would be nice to go as a family.\\
422 - Do you think we have enough?\\
423 - Let's hope so.\\
424 - I cleaned out every bait shop in town.\\
425 - What the hell did you do that for?\\
426 - Your stuff was in my spot.\\
427 - I would've moved it.\\
428 - Try asking, butt-munch.\\
429 - Right, like you hear anything but the sound of your own voice.\\
430 - Get bent.\\
431 - Bite me.\\
432 - I liked you better when we were gay.\\
433 - Me, too.

63 - Goodbye.\\
64 - Let's go.\\
65 - Kitty?\\
66 - Kitty Kenarban!\\
67 - It's how long you're out?\\

69 - Hello, Hal.\\
70 - Hello, Kitty.\\

72 - What are you doing there?\\
73 - I sort of followed my family so far\\
74 - Without the courage to speak to them\\
75 - I want to go.\\
76 - You want to go?\\
77 - I know what I did was horrible.\\
78 - I do not know what went through my head.\\
79 - I think I spent so much time stuck, completely rigid\\
80 - something broke in me and I had to be mean.\\
81 - The last two years of my life are a mist\\
82 - binge drinking in orgiastic of hotel rooms\\
83 - There were so many parties, both parties so strange.\\

85 - Just as "The Four Corners" "The game factor" or "Blind Man's Bluff."\\
86 - You know what's really great?\\
87 - Now that I have literally done everything.\\
88 - It's over.\\
89 - I stop.\\
90 - You did everything?\\
91 - And now I'm done. Once and for all.\\
92 - "Blind Man's Bluff" yes, but "Four Corners"?\\
93 - I'm really, really sorry for everything I did\\
94 - I dream of me at the feet of Abe and beg him to forgive me, but\\
95 - it seems impossible today\\
96 - Would you be kind enough to intervene him for me?\\
97 - Kitty ...\\
98 - It is absolutely out of the question I'm doing this for you\\
99 - But ..\\
100 - You left your family.\\
101 - You realize the suffering, the humiliation that you made to undergo a lovely man\\
102 - and a poor boy innocent?\\
103 - I know we have been friends in the past, but what you have done is so unclean\\
104 - it is not enough to say "I'm sorry" so that it gets better\\
105 - It does not help.\\
106 - Hey, so this party where it is?\\
107 - Hello, Kitty.\\
108 - Ok you tell me about it later\\

120 - Give me 5 seconds ... I'm a little stressed.\\
121 - - What happens? - Kitty came to see me last night.\\
122 - Oh, Abe. Do you want tea or coffee?\\
123 - Thank you but what I want, is to see more clearly\\
124 - What?\\
125 - Have you actually told the woman I love you found it disgusting and evil?\\
126 - - Wait a minute. You want me to me? - What happened, Abe?\\
127 - We talked all night with Kitty and she told me absolutely everything\\
128 - In detail as horrific as it is\\
129 - And in the morning, we decided to be given a second chance\\

131 - And God knows how much I need a woman\\
132 - So, I'd like that in the future, Lois,\\
133 - you to do be a little more understanding and respect my wife\\
134 - You're mad at me?\\
135 - You'll do as if he had nothing happened in the last 2 years?\\

137 - Should you see it.\\
138 - Tell you that I'll never get anything in my life\\
139 - Prepare to be amazed\\
140 - I will fully peel me toes hair to have a single skin\\
141 - The most unheard of thing all the time\\

1 - Crap!\\
2 - Pick. Ass. Oh.\\
3 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.06 - Hal's Christmas Gift\\
4 - Synchronisation par Mark, Relecture par Tyno.\\
5 - Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com\\
6 - Stupid Christmas vacation.\\
7 - There's nothing to do.\\
8 - I wish I cared about something. Then I could do that.\\
9 - You missed it! It was so awesome!\\
10 - - What? - Reese just came up with the most fun thing to do.\\
11 - Riding your bike through the graveyard with your eyes closed.\\
12 - He smashed into this one gravestone, flew through the air, hit another gravestone and landed in an open grave.\\
13 - Lying in that hole was surprisingly peaceful.\\
14 - I no longer fear death.\\
15 - I've been sitting here bored out of my mind for four hours. Why didn't you invite me?\\
16 - Didn't we?\\
17 - No. You didn't. You walked right by me. I thought you were going out to the garage.\\
18 - Oh, well.\\
19 - It's not a big deal.\\
20 - It's just that my feelings are kind of...\\
21 - Oh, crap!\\
22 - Your what are kind of what?\\
23 - - Nothing. Forget it. - I think someone has feelings, Dewey.\\
24 - I do not!\\
25 - We've gotta make this right.\\
26 - - Group hug? - Shut up!\\
27 - Oh, listen to those feelings.\\
28 - - Come here, you. - Get away from me!\\
29 - In our house, that's the "F" word.\\
30 - Okay, if we get Reese the walkie-talkies with only two channels,\\
31 - we can move $8.20 from his pile to Dewey's pile.\\
32 - Then Dewey can get the Spider-man figure that sticks to walls.\\
33 - We have enough stuff that sticks to walls.\\
34 - Dewey can live with the regular Spider-man. Just make sure that Malcolm's pile has enough in it...\\
35 - Hal, we don't have a pile for Jamie.\\
36 - Oh, damn it!\\
37 - - You know, Jamie's not even old enough to know it's Christmas. We could... - Hal.\\
38 - All right!\\
39 - But this is ridiculous. $93 to get gifts for four boys.\\
40 - Well, it's our own fault. We just weren't frugal enough.\\
41 - What else can we do? We're already doing no-electricity Wednesdays,\\
42 - lunch lotteries,\\
43 - - Family flush. - Okay, we'll make it work somehow. Just put it into four piles.\\
44 - - Hello? - Hey, Mom, good news. I decided to come home for Christmas after all.\\
45 - Francis, that is, um...\\
46 - great.\\
47 - What a nice surprise that you will be coming home for Christmas.\\
48 - We'll have the whole family here...\\
49 - exchanging gifts.\\
50 - - Piama, too? - Of course. We can't wait to see you!\\
51 - Well, we can't wait to see you.\\
52 - - Six piles? - Five.\\
53 - Piama and Jamie can share.\\
54 - Excuse me?\\
55 - I know you didn't think anyone would catch you, but you just slammed your door into my car.\\
56 - The least you could do is say you're sorry, lady.\\
57 - You don't have to take that tone.\\
58 - It's not like I'm hurting your resale value.\\
59 - I'm sorry.\\
60 - See? Like that.\\
61 - I don't know what happened.\\
62 - I just lost control of myself.\\
63 - It was like an out-of-body experience, and I was there watching this woman go insane. And the woman was me.\\
64 - But you know what, Hal?\\
65 - I'd do it all over again.\\
66 - It felt great.\\
67 - It was almost worth destroying my car.\\
68 - Well, honey, the important thing is no cops were there to see it.\\
69 - No one says a word.\\
70 - This is my one. My one to your 11,000.\\
71 - So,\\
72 - due to unforeseen circumstances, we are now completely broke.\\
73 - Therefore, I am making a proclamation.\\
74 - This will be a handmade Christmas.\\
75 - We're not spending any money on gifts.\\
76 - They will be homemade,\\
77 - and therefore, more personal\\
78 - and more thoughtful.\\
79 - - But you can't do this! - Well, I think it's high time we had a handmade Christmas.\\
80 - You boys just don't appreciate the holidays. To you it's nothing but a disgusting orgy of materialism.\\
81 - - But... - No buts!\\
82 - You're the ones who turned your mother into a ticking time bomb!\\
83 - Oh, you just thank your lucky stars that she went off on an innocent bystander!\\
84 - So we had our Christmas feast of oatmeal and hot dog buns. Since then, we've been waiting three hours for Dad to come out of the garage.\\
85 - What is taking him so long?\\
86 - What are you talking about?\\
87 - Nothing you'd be interested in.\\
88 - You don't know that.\\
89 - If it's interesting to you guys, it's gonna be interesting to me.\\
90 - We were wondering what nose hairs smell like.\\
91 - Well, that's very interesting!\\
92 - Hal, hurry up already!\\
93 - In a minute.\\
94 - Hal!\\
95 - All right, everyone over by the tree.\\
96 - - Open mine first! - Okay, okay. Let's see what little Dewey made for his dad.\\
97 - Where did you find that?\\
98 - I never take a good picture.\\
99 - I went through every box in the attic and found that one.\\
100 - I made the frame with mementos of your hobbies.\\
101 - Wait. You made this frame?\\
102 - Yeah.\\
103 - See it has a little golf club, a fishing pole, a poker hand. I even pasted on the Jumble you finished.\\
104 - Dewey, this is really nice.\\
105 - - Here, Mom, this is from me. - Oh, it's so heavy.\\
106 - Wow! Reese, are these jams?\\
107 - And candies. I had some sugar left over, so I figured, why not, it's Christmas.\\
108 - - You made this?! - Here, Mom. Here, Dad.\\
109 - Oh, my God, it's a clock.\\
110 - You made this?!\\
111 - I read up on all-wood clocks and then borrowed the tools from wood shop. See the gears? They make different patterns as they turn.\\
112 - Oh, I'm very impressed, boys. You all worked so hard on these gifts.\\
113 - - Open mine next. It's a sonata I composed for you. - Oh, I'll get to it.\\
114 - It's your father's turn to give something.\\
115 - My gift...\\
116 - isn't here.\\
117 - - Not here? What do you mean? Well, we-we knew the boys would really come through with great gifts,\\
118 - and any present that top what they did can't be here...\\
119 - can it?\\
120 - Merry Chris... You started without us?\\
121 - Dad's about to give us a really cool present!\\
122 - Is it outside?\\
123 - Let's find out.\\
124 - Like a treasure hunt?\\
125 - Wow, Mom, this is fantastic. I am so happy to be home for Christmas.\\
126 - You said this house was Satan's trash can.\\
127 - You're quoting me out of context.\\
128 - So, Dad, where is it?\\
129 - Are we supposed to drive to it?\\
130 - Yes!\\
131 - Yes!\\
132 - You guessed the first clue. Everybody into the van. Let's go!\\
133 - - Hal... - Merry Christmas, honey!\\
134 - Are we there yet?\\
135 - Yeah, where are we going?\\
136 - I know. We're going to Disneyland.\\
137 - It's a thousand times better than Disneyland.\\
138 - Cool!\\
139 - What was that?\\
140 - A handshake.\\
141 - Now they've got some lame, third-grade secret handshake.\\
142 - I think I got half of it.\\
143 - We love Dad!\\
144 - We love Dad!\\
145 - We love Dad!\\
146 - We love Dad!\\
147 - We love Dad!\\
148 - Rest stop. Everybody out. No eye contact with strangers.\\
149 - Look at 'em scamper.\\
150 - - You don't need to...? - No.\\
151 - - You couldn't have said twice as good as Disneyland? - You saw those presents, Lois! What was I supposed to do? My presents were crap!\\
152 - - What did you make them? - Lanyards.\\
153 - Still better than what I had.\\
154 - Look, I underestimated these boys, Lois,  and they deserve to have a really great Christmas.\\
155 - How much money do we have?\\
156 - - Zero. - No, I mean everything: credit cards, loose change, everything?\\
157 - - Oh. Minus $512. - What?!\\
158 - Oh, for God's sakes!\\
159 - Can you think of a Christmas reason for stopping somewhere I can sell blood?\\
160 - Oh, Hal, don't worry about it. It'll be okay.\\
161 - You just need to find something that's a thousand times better than Disneyland,\\
162 - open on Christmas day and free.\\
163 - Just because it's hard, Lois, doesn't mean it's impossible. I am going to make this happen.\\
164 - Hal, we don't even have enough gas to get home.\\
165 - Yes, we do. I did all the calculations, Lois. We're exactly 40 miles from the point of no return. And I promise you,\\
166 - I will figure out a plan by then.\\
167 - If not, I will turn the van around. Just don't rat me out.\\
168 - Please, honey.\\
169 - It's Christmas.\\
170 - I can't wait much longer.\\
171 - Mom, is it really going to be as good as Dad says?\\
172 - Dewey, I think you'll remember this day for a long time.\\
173 - I think we'll all remember this day for a very long time.\\
174 - All right, since no one wants to race cigarette butts, I'm outta here.\\
175 - Francis, I need to talk to you about something.\\
176 - It's weird,\\
177 - - but lately I kind of feel like I'm being left out by Reese and Dewey. - Aw, geez. Look, I'm sorry. You weren't supposed to know about the beach trip.\\
178 - - What?! - Hey, geez, watch it!\\
179 - What beach trip?!\\
180 - I took Reese and Dewey to the beach last summer. I would've invited you, but you were over at Stevie's.\\
181 - He lives two blocks away!\\
182 - You have to go by his house to get to the beach!\\
183 - Why is this happening?\\
184 - I'm the brother everybody likes the best.\\
185 - What are you talking about? I'm the brother everybody likes best.\\
186 - I meant of the brothers who are still at home.\\
187 - That's Dewey.\\
188 - - What? Where am I in the pecking order? - Malcolm, I am not gonna stand here in a public toilet and rank me, Dewey, Reese, Jamie and you in order of popularity.\\
189 - So are we getting close?\\
190 - Now, now.\\
191 - You're not going to trick me into giving it away.\\
192 - It's a surprise.\\
193 - Hal, you are five miles from your point of no return.\\
194 - Look, I know we don't talk about our emotions, but I don't care anymore.\\
195 - I'm just going to lay it out there.\\
196 - My feelings are hurt.\\
197 - There, I said it.\\
198 - They're hurt because you guys are systematically excluding me.\\
199 - Being excluded is extra hard for me because I see all the other places I don't fit in, and we're brothers.\\
200 - I really want us to be in this together.\\
201 - What a gasbag.\\
202 - Your feelings aren't hurt. Your ego is bruised.\\
203 - The reason we exclude you sometimes  is because you're a drag.\\
204 - You always have to be the special one.\\
205 - Even now, this is all about how you feel things more deeply than everyone else.\\
206 - Look, we love you. We just need a break from you once in a while.\\
207 - - Okay, Hal... - Francis, can I see you up here for a second, please? I need your help with the radio.\\
208 - - What are you...? - I need to borrow $1,800. I'll pay you back over the next six years in monthly payments of $39.50. I have no money to give these boys a Christmas gift and I'm not even sure where I'm driving.\\
209 - I hate to ask you, but I don't know what else to do.\\
210 - I love you.\\
211 - Well I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you.\\
212 - - I got fired from my job. I'm totally broke. - What?\\
213 - - You got fired from the ranch? - It turns out the ATM I was making all of Otto's deposits into wasn't an ATM.\\
214 - So sue me, right?\\
215 - Anyway, he's suing me.\\
216 - - I don't know what we're going to do. - You're not moving back in!\\
217 - - There isn't room enough in the house! - Besides, Piama doesn't want to live with us.\\
218 - Piama doesn't even know about it. She thinks I'm on vacation.\\
219 - - I've been acting like the happiest man in the world the last few weeks just to hide it from her. - I have to say, I am a little disappointed in you, Francis.\\
220 - You can't hide something like this from the ones you love.\\
221 - Honesty: it's the cornerstone of any healthy relationship.\\
222 - Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.\\
223 - Okay, Hal, it's been 40 miles. We are at the point of no return.\\
224 - Hal, turn around.\\
225 - Let's get out and stretch your legs!\\
226 - You're coming Malcom?\\
227 - You're sure? I might accidently talk about myself.\\
228 - You mean like just now?\\
229 - - Hal what are you doing, - I'm buying time.\\
230 - I don't know how you gotta be along with this but that's it!\\
231 - The Christmas lie is over.\\
232 - - 60 more seconds, Lois. You can time me. - I'm not...!\\
233 - Fine.\\
234 - Whoa, nice rides.\\
235 - Yeah. The fat lady at the car wash rides one of these.\\
236 - - Nice going, Dewey! - I wasn't even touching it. It was you!\\
237 - What'd you do, man?!\\
238 - Wait, wait! Those guys didn't do it.\\
239 - What are you talking about?\\
240 - I'm not going to let these people take the blame when they didn't do it.\\
241 - It was my dad.\\
242 - He was trying to teach me a lesson so I wouldn't grow up and be like you.\\
243 - Malcolm, oh, my God, that was awesome!\\
244 - - That was so cool! - Thanks!\\
245 - Okay, honey, you've got 20 seconds.\\
246 - Lois, there is going to be a Christmas!\\
247 - Hal, no!\\
248 - Oh, no! I seem to have slipped in an oil stain left here by a negligent owner or employee.\\
249 - Hal!\\
250 - Oh, my God!\\
251 - Are you okay?\\
252 - Yes, damn it!\\
253 - Oh, thank goodness.\\
254 - I don't have any insurance.\\
255 - We both dodged a bullet.\\
256 - After I sweep this up, you're getting wiper  blades on the house.\\
257 - Hal...\\
258 - You know what?\\
259 - - I saw a trail behind here that leads up into the hills. There's probably  something really great up there. All we need is a few flashlights to get started. - Hal,\\
260 - it's time for you to face the boys and tell them what's going on. Hal, they're good boys.\\
261 - They forgave you for banjo camp; they'll forgive you for this.\\
262 - And I will try sharing the blame with you, but honey,\\
263 - this has got your fingerprints all over it.\\
264 - - You know, you're a pretty good brother after all. - Thanks. You look cold. Take my jacket.\\
265 - I think I could've handled those bikers,\\
266 - but with a baby and a chick around, you probably did the  right thing, Malcolm.\\
267 - Thanks for thinking of us, Reese.\\
268 - What's this?\\
269 - Nothing. Give me that.\\
270 - It's a credit card receipt from The Clockworks.\\
271 - You bought those clocks?\\
272 - You have a credit card? Since when?\\
273 - They sent it to me in the mail a couple months ago.\\
274 - They must've thought I was old enough after I won that physics award.\\
275 - So when I superglued my eyelids shut, and I was in the emergency room, we could've used your credit card instead of having to call Mom?!\\
276 - I'm not going to let you jeopardize my credit rating. I want to buy a house someday.\\
277 - Malcolm, you're a jerk.\\
278 - Mom, Malcolm has a credit card, and he bought you Christmas presents with it.\\
279 - What?\\
280 - Malcolm, you bought those presents,\\
281 - after everything I've been through?\\
282 - We all worked so hard to make this a special Christmas,  and you just took a cheap shortcut!\\
283 - - Those clocks cost 50 bucks each! - I don't care what they cost!\\
284 - This isn't a competition, Malcolm.\\
285 - You know, all I really want from you on Christmas is this!\\
286 - I forgive you, son.\\
287 - Okay, everybody, listen up.  I don't want this to ruin our trip.\\
288 - - You wanna know where we're going? - Yeah!\\
289 - Snow skiing on Mount Bundy!\\
290 - That's a room for the night, ski passes and equipment rentals. Will you be putting that on your credit card?\\
291 - Let's give it a shot.\\
292 - Oh, yes!\\
293 - In your face!\\
294 - Hal, this is the low point, isn't it?\\
295 - We're not going to sink any further, are we?\\
296 - - What are you talking about? - You've stolen our son's credit card.\\
297 - If it weren't for my rage and your recklessness, our kids might have a fighting chance.\\
298 - Lois, those are the exact things that make us great parents. If it wasn't for your anger and my recklessness, we wouldn't be on this amazing ski vacation, would we?\\
299 - You know, this just might be our best Christmas ever.\\
300 - Francis, I want you to quit your job.\\
301 - - What? - Ever since we left on this trip, you've just seemed so insanely happy.\\
302 - I can't let you go back to that job. You've got to find something else to do.\\
303 - You're right.\\
304 - You know, in fact, let's not even go back to that ranch. I'll call Otto in the morning, and if he doesn't understand,\\
305 - tough.\\
306 - Okay, so who wants some hot chocolate by the fire, huh?\\
307 - - Enjoy your stay, Malcolm. - Thanks.

42 - Oui !\\
43 - Je me sens comme dans un r ve.\\

52 - Je te fais juste remarquer que tu es tant int ress  par la d mocratie que je t'ai aussi inscrit   l' lection des d l gu s.\\
53 - Quoi ?!\\
54 - Je dois admettre que c'est intelligent de faire concourir Hanson et Zoe aux  lections.\\
55 - Ca peut les humilier.\\
56 - La seule chose plus humiliante est de perdre face   eux.\\
57 - Laisse  a tranquille.\\

123 - D'accord.\\
124 - Tu devrais retourner   l'int rieur, vaut mieux pas que tu vois  a.\\
125 - Salut, Maman.\\
126 - Tu sais, quand je parlais de donner quelque chose en  change ?\\
127 - Eh ben, j'y ai r fl chis.\\
128 - J'aurais pu faire du b n volat dans un centre de sans-abri, apprendre   lire   des enfants...\\
129 - Et puis l'id e m'est venue.\\
130 - J'ai achet  une guitare !\\
131 - Quoi ?\\
132 - C'est parfait !\\
133 - Dewey a cet incroyable talent musical, je l'ai forc ment aussi, je n'ai juste pas encore essay .\\
134 - Tu as combien de temps pour la rendre ?\\
135 - Quinze jours... Mais je n'ai pas l'intention de la rendre.\\
136 - Ca suffira pour que tu te rendes compte que tu en es incapable.\\
137 - De quoi tu parles ?!\\
138 - Je peux jouer de la musique si je veux.\\
139 - D sol e, ch ri, mais non.\\
140 - Ton cerveau ne fonctionne pas comme  a. Tu n'as pas l' tincelle artistique.\\
141 - Quoi ?\\
142 - Tu vois, Dewey est un esprit flottant.\\
143 - Il n'a qu'  agir comme bon lui semble et tout arrive   point pour lui.\\
144 - Toi et moi, nous sommes des esprits terrestres.\\
145 - C'est lorsqu'on est au plus bas qu'on r ussit le mieux. Et on en bave au milieu d'un amas de d chets.\\
146 - Tu n'en sais rien.\\
147 - Si, je le sais.\\
148 - Tu crois savoir dans quel domaine je suis bon avant m me que j'essaye.\\
149 - Tout a fait.\\
150 - Oh, vraiment !\\
151 - Alors dis-moi ce que je vaux en plong e sous-marine, escalade et danse flamenco.\\
152 - Mauvais en plong e sous-marine, bon en escalade. Flamenco : un d sastre.\\
153 - Je n'essai pas de te vexer, je te dis simplement ce que je sais.\\
154 - Heureusement que t' tais pas la m re de John Lennon.\\
155 - Si j'avais  t  la m re de John Lennon, il serait toujours en vie.\\
156 - Salut, Reese.\\
157 - Salut, Papa.\\
158 - Oh, tiens. Une nouvelle montre.\\
159 - Merci. Pourquoi t'as fait  a ?\\
160 - Je ne sais pas.\\
161 - Une pens e a r sonn e dans ma t te comme quoi tu en avais besoin d'une.\\
162 - Et tu ne sais pas pourquoi ?\\
163 - Tu dois voir  a.\\
164 - J'ai finalement trouv  le cadeau d'anniversaire parfait pour ta m re.\\
165 - Elle a eu cette m me bo te   musique quand nous  tions mari s la premi re fois.\\
166 - Jusqu'  ce que ton fr re Francis en prenne possession et la casse en millions de morceaux.\\
167 - Quoi qu'il en soit, j'ai parcouru cette boutique d'antiquit s, totalement d sesp r , et elle y  tait.\\
168 - La m me bo te   musique ! Oh, quel soulagement.\\
169 - Je vais dormir comme un b b  cette nuit.\\
170 - J'ai quinze jours pour savoir en jouer et humilier totalement ma m re.\\
171 - Ca para t faisable.\\
172 - J'oublierai que j'ai vu  a, si tu me dis tout ce que tu sais sur le somnambulisme.\\
173 - Le somnambulisme ?\\
174 - Tout ce que je sais c'est que c'est un  tat dissociative qui   l'origine...\\
175 - Dis-moi juste ce qui en est la cause.\\
176 - Ben, il y a plusieurs choses.\\
177 - Ca arrive souvent lorsqu'une personne subit un stress  motionnel intense.\\
178 - Donc, si un somnambule reste stress , il continuera le somnambulisme ?\\
179 - Je sais pas, sans doute.\\
180 - G nial !\\
181 - C'est qui le petit charpentier ?\\
182 - C'est Jamie, le petit charpentier.\\
183 - Toi, viens avec moi.\\
184 - Je l'avais !\\
185 - Le cadeau, parfait... d truit !\\
186 - Ce petit. Vilain... vilaines couches !\\
187 - Allez Hal, c'est du pass .\\
188 - Le plus important c'est que je sois l  pour t'aider.\\
189 - Besoin d'aide. Peux pas faire  a seul.\\
190 - Demain, en allant au travail tu te rendras compte que ton fils pr f r  Reese n'a plus de produits pour cheveux.\\
191 - Alors tu composeras un joli panier plein de shampooings et de gels coiffants.\\
192 - Ca doit  tre fait... pas de question, au travail !\\
193 - C'est int ressant que tu en parles, parce qu'il y a quelques projets que j'ai trouv s pour toi.\\
194 - Oh, mais d'abord...\\
195 - Je voudrais que tu fasses quelque chose de tr s important pour moi.\\
196 - Important ! Bien s r que c'est important !\\
197 - Oui,  a l'est. Je veux que tu embrasses  a.\\
198 - Tu sais, comme si t'en avais vraiment besoin.\\
199 - Soyons amis !\\
200 - Oui, oui. Je vous remercie.\\
201 - Je d teste les  lections. Les  lecteurs ne lisent pas, ils ne votent pas par eux-m mes. Ils sont compl tement influenc s par la derni re rumeur qu'ils ont entendu.\\
202 - Que ce soit vrai ou pas.\\
203 - La d mocratie est un  chec parce qu'on n'y fait pas face.\\
204 - Les gens sont des idiots.\\
205 - Je pense que tu te sentirais mieux vis   vis du monde, Dewey, si tu avais un robot zombi programmable.\\
206 - C'est exact, je cherche   remplacer la bo te   musique avec la ballerine sur le dessus.\\
207 - Eh bien, je ne voudrais pas dire cass e   tel point elle s'est vaporis e.\\
208 - Mon petit gar on en a pris main basse.\\
209 - Oh, donne-moi  a.\\
210 - Mais j'appr cierais vraiment si vous pouviez m'aider.\\
211 - Une liste de distributeurs locaux qui pourraient avoir une.\\
212 - De quoi vous parlez ? Pourquoi je ferais  a ?!\\
213 - Ecoutez, la v rit  est que je quelque peu d sesp r  donc si vous pouviez juste me fournir quelques informations qui peuvent m'aider   trouver une autre bo te   musique avec une ballerine, vous pourriez vraiment transformer  a en une tr s sp ciale f te d'anniversaire.\\
214 - D sol e, je suis en retard.\\
215 - Oh, s'il vous plait, comme si les orphelins verront vraiment une partie de cet argent que je vous donnerais.\\
216 - Avez-vous un orphelin   vos c t s ? Puis-je parler   l'un d'eux ?\\
217 - Je ne crois pas. Vous savez quoi ? Vous me rendez malade !\\
218 - Maudit t l prospecteur !\\
219 - Hal, tu sais ce que j'ai r alis  sur le chemin de retour ?\\
220 - Notre vingti me anniversaire est dans trois jours.\\
221 - Ah, juste trois jours, hein ?\\
222 - Whoa, c'est tr s proche.\\
223 - Ca arrivera avant que tu t'en aper oives.\\
224 - Vingt ans. Nous devons vraiment faire quelque chose de sp cial.\\
225 - Elle l'a vraiment fait, je l'ai vu ici, je le jure !\\
226 - C'est un menteur ! Vote pour moi !\\
227 - Arr tez de me crier dessus ! Vous n' tes pas mes conseillers d'orientation !\\
228 - Les gars, calmez-vous. Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?\\
229 - Zoe pense qu'elle fera un meilleur pr sident que moi m me si le fait est qu'elle mange ses propres poux !\\
230 - Oh ouais, je me demande comment les  lecteurs se sentiraient s'ils savaient que Hanson aime embrasser sur la bouche son caniche !\\
231 - Et je le sais car les chiens ne me mentent pas.\\
232 - Qu'est-ce que vous fa tes ?!\\
233 - Je pensais que vous deux resterez amis peu importe ce qui arrive.\\
234 - Oh, r veille-toi, Dewey. Il y en a un peu trop dans ce cas l  pour jouer   ce jeu.\\
235 - Arr te  a !\\
236 - La v rit  est que vous  tes tous deux candidats pour une plaisanterie.\\
237 - Vous aviez une chance de montrer au reste de l' cole que vous valez mieux que Kyle et ses amis.\\
238 - L , vous n' tes pas diff rents que ce qu'ils sont.\\
239 - On  tait une  quipe. Vous deux et les quatre autour de moi.\\
240 - Vous n'avez aucune id e de qui vous  tes d sormais.\\
241 - Vous fa tes comme vous voulez. J'en suis malade.\\
242 - - Hal, tu n'as m me pas touch  ta tarte. - Je la garde pour Reese.\\
243 - J'ai quelque chose que je veux que vous  coutiez.\\
244 - Je me suis entra n .\\
245 - Vraiment beaucoup entra n . Et j'ai eu une id e de chanson.\\
246 - Je ne sais pas si c'est bon ou mauvais mais... Ca repr sente vraiment quelque chose pour moi.\\
247 - Est-ce que  a vous d range si je vous la joue ?\\
248 - Bien s r que non, Malcolm, nous aimerions l'entendre.\\

\subsection {Episode 08: Lois Battles Jamie}
1 - Mr. Hawkins? It's Hal.\\
2 - Remember a few weeks ago, in the break room, when someone left the tin foil on their burrito and the microwave caught fire and the sprinklers went off and shorted out all the computers and we lost all our database for the last five years?\\
3 - Yeah, well, I just thought you might like to know who the "slack-jawed idiot" was.\\
4 - Dad, Dad, you need four apples, not three!\\
5 - You only won another lottery ticket!\\
6 - It was Phil in accounting. He feels just awful about it, and I wouldn't be too hard on him.\\
7 - His wife's a bit of a drinker, and she's not particularly faithful...\\
8 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.08 - Lois Battles Jamie\\

11 - I'm starving. I hope Mom has something decent for dinner.\\
12 - I saw her pulling baloney stew out of the freezer last night.\\
13 - Don't worry.\\
14 - I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.\\
15 - Holy crap. Look at that!\\
16 - Cool! A diving board!\\
17 - Oh... my... God.\\
18 - This is the greatest thing ever.\\
19 - And someone just dumped it here for us to find.\\
20 - We've got to take it home!\\
21 - What are we gonna do with it?\\
22 - I don't know.\\
23 - But... look at it!\\
24 - It's... it's got the... and it's... up and...\\
25 - and bounce and... and bounce!\\
26 - He's right. We need it.\\
27 - One, two, three... go!\\
28 - One, two, three... go!\\
29 - One, two, three, go!\\
30 - One, two, three, go!\\
31 - Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!\\
32 - You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas? You love peas!\\
33 - Come on. This is name-brand stuff.\\
34 - It's three times the price of the food I eat!\\
35 - If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth.\\
36 - See? There's no reason for...\\
37 - Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too.\\
38 - Hi, honey.\\
39 - Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?\\
40 - This is the same fight as breakfast.\\
41 - It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.\\
42 - That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with.\\
43 - Hal,\\
44 - I'm not about to lose it with a...\\
45 - God, how does he do that?\\
46 - One, two, three, go!\\
47 - Please, we have to stop.\\
48 - I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.\\
49 - One last time.\\
50 - One, two, three, go!\\
51 - This is gonna be so great!\\
52 - This is the answer.\\
53 - What's the question?\\
54 - I don't know yet,\\
55 - but this is definitely the answer.\\
56 - Would you look at this?\\
57 - Jamie poured flour in the dryer.\\
58 - Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.\\
59 - He destroys everything!\\
60 - He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!\\
61 - Oh, you say that with every kid.\\
62 - Let's face it, Lois.\\
63 - It's just the hand we were dealt.\\
64 - God just doesn't like us.\\
65 - That doesn't make us bad people.\\
66 - No, there's something different with Jamie.\\
67 - He's not like the other ones.\\
68 - I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes.\\
69 - Honey, calm down.\\
70 - You know what will make you feel better?\\
71 - You take a look at him while he's sleeping.\\
72 - You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that...\\
73 - Did you see him?\\
74 - See who?\\
75 - That-a-way!\\
76 - We're in lockdown!\\
77 - This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.\\
78 - The perimeter's sealed.\\
79 - He's not getting out this way.\\
80 - My jewelry box!\\
81 - Jamie, Mommy told you...\\
82 - All right, Jamie,\\
83 - you've had your fun.\\
84 - Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.\\
85 - Jamie...\\
86 - I asked you to give it to me!\\
87 - Would you look at this thing?\\
88 - It's amazing.\\
89 - We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.\\
90 - What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?\\
91 - Nah. We could do that off the roof.\\
92 - We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.\\
93 - Uh-uh. It's not good enough.\\
94 - We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.\\
95 - Not good enough.\\
96 - Not for her.\\
97 - Not this old beauty.\\
98 - Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O...\\
99 - No! It's not good enough!\\
100 - I  got it!\\
101 - We take a dog,\\
102 - tie him to a bicycle...\\
103 - No! It's just not good enough!\\
104 - Mom's home early!\\
105 - You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite,\\
106 -  you do not spit, you do not eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!\\
107 - A lifetime ban from Gymboree!\\
108 - A lifetime ban!\\
109 - I can't believe it.\\
110 - She  didn't even see the board.\\
111 - This is a sign we were meant to have this.\\
112 - We were meant to do something really, really great with you.\\
113 - It'll come.\\
114 - We just have to be patient.\\
115 - No!\\
116 - This is Mommy's purse!\\
117 - You can't have it!\\
118 - Please,\\
119 - it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!\\
120 - Lois...\\
121 - Well, he has a million toys.\\
122 - Why does he only want to take my things?\\
123 - Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally.\\
124 - He doesn't understand what he's doing. He's just a baby.\\
125 - Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes,\\
126 - he'll get tired of it.\\
127 - You're right.\\
128 - I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him,\\
129 - he'd see it as a sign of weakness.\\
130 - - I'm going to stop this right now. - Yeah.\\
131 - Here, sweetie.\\
132 - Mommy's purse.\\
133 - You can have that for five minutes, okay?\\
134 - I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.\\
135 - It's mocking us.\\
136 - It's a ten-foot-tall springboard that we got for free,\\
137 - and we can't think of a single thing that's good enough to do with it!\\
138 - I bet it belonged to some other family that went crazy because they couldn't come up with anything to do with it.\\
139 - They probably just sat around, staring at it for months, until they finally snapped and started eating each other.\\
140 - Damn it, we're better than this! I know we are!\\
141 - Remember that squashed groundhog we found on the highway?\\
142 - We came up with a hundred things to do with that,\\
143 - from the horrible to the beautiful!\\
144 - I miss Flatty.\\
145 - Maybe we're just going about this the wrong way.\\
146 - We have to think outside the box.\\
147 - If you were a diving board, what would you want someone to do with you?\\
148 - Take me ice-skating.\\
149 - Don't be an idiot.\\
150 - That place is freezing, and it's always so crowded.\\
151 - Yeah, but they have good hot dogs.\\
152 - Those hot dogs suck compared to the ones at the train station.\\
153 - Why would a diving board want to go to a train station?\\
154 - How should I know?\\
155 - Maybe he wants to visit a relative.\\
156 - Okay! Okay!\\
157 - Back in the box.\\
158 - Jamie doesn't have to eat his peas anymore.\\
159 - He can eat whatever he wants because Mommy surrenders.\\
160 - Mommy has a tiny pony for Jamie who wants to hug him and give him yummy candy corn...\\
161 - Mmm, I'm delicious!\\
162 - Is there a big boy who could eat me?\\
163 - Gotcha, you little...\\
164 - Jamie tries to kill Mom,\\
165 - and we're the ones who have to clean it up.\\
166 - You want to tell me how that's fair?\\
167 - You gotta give that kid some credit.\\
168 - It's the closest any of us actually ever came.\\
169 - Yeah.\\
170 - Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?\\
171 - No. If he was, we'd have a way better house.\\
172 - You're  the one, Jamie.\\
173 - Show me the way!\\
174 - There's a lot of things I can handle. A lot of things I've managed to survive.\\
175 - I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.\\
176 - Yes, honey, you certainly have.\\
177 - Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work.\\
178 - Soothing.\\
179 - - Sooth... - Dad, we finish...\\
180 - I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!\\
181 - This is a child-free zone until further notice!\\
182 - Soothing... soothing...\\
183 - You know what, Hal?\\
184 - I'm done. I give up.\\
185 - What are you talking about?\\
186 - Jamie wins. He beat me.\\
187 - All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done.\\
188 - It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down.\\
189 - Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint.\\
190 - I'm just paint, Hal.\\
191 - Jamie knows it.\\
192 - You'll do a better job than I can.\\
193 - I trust you.\\
194 - No, no, no.\\
195 - No-no-no-no-no-no!\\
196 - You can't leave me alone with those kids!\\
197 - We had a deal, Lois!\\
198 - You are in charge of the spiritual and emotional development,\\
199 - discipline and scary injuries.\\
200 - I kill spiders,\\
201 - mark their heights on the door frames and supply car snacks.\\
202 - You walk out now and the whole system falls apart!\\
203 - I can't do it, Hal.\\
204 - I don't want to. I just don't have it anymore.\\
205 - I mean, it's normal, right?\\
206 - People give up, they quit...\\
207 - Lois, you listen to me. No one is as good as you are.\\
208 - You took those vicious little fiends, and you twisted and crushed them into submission.\\
209 - And you didn't do it because you had to. You did it because you loved the game, and it was beautiful!\\
210 - I just don't have that anymore.\\
211 - Honey, yes, you do. I know you do.\\
212 - You just lost your way a little.\\
213 - You just need to think. Think back to the first time you found that spark.\\
214 - There's got to be some way to remember.\\
215 - And I'm going to help you.\\
216 - So, here I am.\\
217 - Dad said you needed some help on something?\\
218 - Francis, your father and I are trying to remember something, and we really need your help.\\
219 - We'd like you to think back to your earliest memories.\\
220 - What's this all about?\\
221 - Mind your own business. Just do it, will ya?\\
222 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
223 - My  childhood was a nightmare! I've spent the rest of my life trying to board up that haunted house.\\
224 - Francis, this is important.\\
225 - I really need to remember something, and I don't know what it is.\\
226 - - But... - Please.\\
227 - You're the only one who can help me.\\
228 - My  earliest memories...\\
229 - It's kind of vague.\\
230 - I remember we had that apartment...\\
231 - I remember it being really colorful.\\
232 - Come on, Francis, honey. Please, won't you eat anything?\\
233 - We've tried the carrots, and the peaches, and the oatmeal, the apples, huh?\\
234 - Don't you like anything?\\
235 - Lois!\\
236 - Would you like to know what your son did to my director's cut of The Eyes of Laura Mars?\\
237 - He also shaved a hole in the carpet with my new Norelco!\\
238 - I'm sorry, Hal. I asked him very nicely not to play with it, but he just wouldn't listen.\\
239 - I can't get him to do anything.\\
240 - I've read Dr. Spock and Piaget and Eisenberg, and The Language of Hugs, all these books, nothing's helping.\\
241 - What he needs is a little discipline.\\
242 - I think he'd behave better if he just ate something.\\
243 - Look at him. He's just wasting away.\\
244 - I'm going to give him another Hershey bar.\\
245 - Lois, no!\\
246 - You can't keep coddling him like this!\\
247 - I am sick and tired of always having to be the bad cop because you're constantly giving in to him.\\
248 - Okay, Hal, I'll try.\\
249 - You keep saying that, and then you do it again!\\
250 - I'm going to be tougher with him. I promise.\\
251 - Huh. It's weird.\\
252 - I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.\\
253 - I hate you!\\
254 - I hate you, I hate you!\\
255 - I hate you!\\
256 - Reese, this is crazy.\\
257 - You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.\\
258 - We're getting rid of it.\\
259 - No! Wait! I finally have an idea.\\
260 - What is it?\\
261 - I'll have it in a second! Just wait!\\
262 - It's over, Reese.\\
263 - Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal.\\
264 - Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?\\
265 - We should be ashamed of ourselves.\\
266 - No! We are not getting rid of this!\\
267 - Reese, what is the big deal?\\
268 - What is so special about this board?\\
269 - I think it's my last time.\\
270 - Last time for what?\\
271 - For anything stupid and reckless and fun.\\
272 - Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now,\\
273 - but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says,\\
274 - "That's dangerous, that's stupid. You're gonna hurt yourself."\\
275 - And the old voice, the one that says,\\
276 - "This is fun. Do it anyways. They'll figure out how to save you."\\
277 - It just gets quieter and quieter.\\
278 - Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.\\
279 - But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way.\\
280 - We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.\\
281 - I'd do it for mine.\\
282 - And then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of...\\
283 - Ah... I don't know. Let's stop. I want to stop.\\
284 - Honey, please, keep going. You can't stop now.\\
285 - No, I don't want to. We've been sitting here for five hours.  Why are we doing this, anyway?\\
286 - Francis, please. I think we're really close.  Just one more time.\\
287 - Well... I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play...\\
288 - Okay, honey. Maybe we'll eat later.\\
289 - Lois, did you see what he did in there?\\
290 - He used my tennis racket to smash  my camera and all my lenses to bits!\\
291 - I still had film in it from the Us Festival!\\
292 - Where is he?\\
293 - Hal, it's not his fault! I'm pretty sure  he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.\\
294 - All the literature says this is the age where he's trying...\\
295 - You cannot undermine me every time I try to discipline him!\\
296 - I can't help it. He's so small, and helpless...\\
297 - I can't take any more of this!  It is tearing our marriage apart!\\
298 - For his own good, you have got to buckle down!\\
299 - Do you understand me, Lois?  You have to find some way to be this boy's mother!\\
300 - Hello, Dr. Sachs? It's Lois again.\\
301 - I know I just called, but... my husband yelled  at me again about being stricter with Francis,\\
302 - and I wanted to know if you could write me a note\\
303 - that says yelling at him could damage his psyche?\\
304 - It's such a tender time for Francis.\\
305 - He's so fragile and unformed and I just want to make sure I get it right,\\
306 - but everything I do feels wrong.  If this is all supposed to be so natural,\\
307 - why can't I get this? I love him  so much and I want to be a good mother\\
308 - and I know I have to be stronger, but I  just don't think I can look in his eyes\\
309 - and not give him what he wants.  He has such a sweet little face and he's so innocent.\\
310 - I'm going to have to call you back.\\
311 - Fire... is... dangerous.\\
312 - Fire can hurt you. Fire can kill you.\\
313 - I will not let that happen.\\
314 - Let me make one thing clear. I love you,\\
315 - and I will do whatever I have to to take care of you,  and keep you safe and happy and alive.\\
316 - I don't care if you grow up to hate me,  but you will understand this:\\
317 - I will... do... anything.\\
318 - That is how much I love you.\\
319 - Yes. That's right. It's coming back to me;  that sense of strength and power, and purpose...\\
320 - I finally knew who I was, and what I was born to be.\\
321 - Honey, you're back!\\
322 - I knew you could do it!\\
323 - Mr. Fuzzles!\\
324 - Thank you, Francis.\\
325 - You can go now.\\
326 - What? What is it?\\
327 - We've got something for you.\\
328 - Dewey and I finally came up with something  good enough for that insane voice in your head.\\
329 - - Here, put this on first. - Roman candles?\\
330 - Well, that's how they started off.  We decided to give 'em a little more... oomph.\\
331 - - Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?  - Hell, no!\\
332 - Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds.  You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board,\\
333 - and jump.\\
334 - The rockets should kick in around there.\\
335 - They won't give you any momentum,  but they will ignite that.\\
336 - Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool.\\
337 - We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.  If the roof doesn't collapse. Or ignite.\\
338 - And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.\\
339 - It has a direct feed to the Internet.  You're the featured page on GiantJackass.com.\\
340 - This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.\\
341 - Nobody deserves it more than you.\\
342 - Should I get the hose?\\
343 - Not yet. He would've wanted us to wait.\\
344 - Good boy. You finished all your peas!\\
345 - Hey, slugger. Guess what. The clinic called.  They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.\\
346 - They can start the skin grafts next week.\\
347 - - Reese, what do you think you're doing?  - What? He loves the stuff.\\
348 - He goes through three or four cans a day.\\
349 - I don't know how he does it. Half a can makes me nuts.

6 - - You are going to be so proud of me. - Why?\\
7 - I spent the last five nights in a chat room reeling in this creep named Heinrich.\\
8 - I got his address and showed up at his house with a printed transcript of our conversations.\\
9 - He calls me "Sugarbuns" 15 times on nine separate occasions.\\
10 - Reese...\\
11 - So the guy starts crying, "What about my wife? What about my kids? I'll do anything."\\
12 - Entrapment.\\
13 - It's not just for police anymore.\\
14 - - Why do I care about this? - The guy works at the racetrack.\\
15 - He's going to make bets for us on the horses we pick.\\
16 - Well, the horses you pick.\\
17 - This is tomorrow's racing form.\\
18 - You'll pick the winners and I'll place the bets, we split the winnings 50-50, like brothers.\\
19 - - That's kind of nice. - Yeah.\\
20 - I got to keep this guy on his toes. Time to leave a suspicious message on his answering machine.\\
21 - Wow, blackmailing a pervert to facilitate underage gambling.\\
22 - How could this not work out?\\
23 - It did work out. It's been four days and Reese and I have already won almost $300.\\
24 - I can't believe it. Reese's plans usually end up with a missing toe or something.\\
25 - Since when... do you...\\
26 - buy lunch?\\
27 - Oh, well, I've been making some extra money at work.\\
28 - There's an incentive program at work, we're given bonuses for finding\\
29 - inefficiencism, it's really improve morale at the store.\\
30 - You know, I actually enjoy going to work now that everybody is...\\
31 - Whoa! Jeez, are you okay?\\
32 - Trying to finish...\\
33 - what God started?\\
34 - I'm sorry, I didn't see the curb. I was distracted by that...\\
35 - Do you believe this?\\
36 - What happened?\\
37 - I was half way through my haircut when Troy casually mentioned that his price had gone up\\
38 - from $21 to $28. And he thought I would just sit there and take it.\\
39 - Well, I showed him, Hal. I got up and I walked right out of there.\\
40 - This is extortion, pure and simple.\\
41 - What are you going to do about...?\\
42 - - Here, even it up. - What?\\
43 - - I can't walk around like this. Cut it. - No, I couldn't.\\
44 - Hal, it doesn't have to look good. Just hack this side off. Even it up.\\
45 - Oh, my God. This is beautiful, Hal. You've never done this before?\\
46 - No, I guess I just have a knack for it.\\
47 - Lois, I didn't think it was possible, but you are even more stunning than ever.\\
48 - Oh, Hal.\\
49 - - What in the...? - This is my new car. I bought it.\\
50 - Now, I know what you're thinking, but please just give me 45 seconds to explain\\
51 - why this is the perfect car for me and how it was such and insanely great deal\\
52 - that I had no choice but to buy it.\\
53 - Hey, there's some black gooey stuff leaking out of it.\\
54 - I know it looks fast and dangerous, but that's a good thing.\\
55 - Cops will have their eye on my car, so I'll be extra motivated to drive safe and slow.\\
56 - It didn't cost much, so I'll have enough to pay for the first year's insurance.\\
57 - Think of all the money you'll save from less wear and tear on your car,\\
58 - - since I won't have to drive it anymore. - I can put my finger through the metal.\\
59 - Dewey, get out of there!\\
60 - I'll be able to work extra shifts since I won't have to ride in with you,\\
61 - which means I'll be bringing more money into the house.\\
62 - Oh, and I love it.\\
63 - I know you don't care, but it just needed to be said.\\
64 - Malcolm, the fact that you even want this so bad should have been your first clue that this is...\\
65 - - Lois. - Hal, he's not...\\
66 - Look, every boy has to go through this. It's the only way they find out what's important in a car.\\
67 - Look, let's go. I need to feather your neckline a little bit.\\
68 - Where were you? We were supposed to meet Heinrich right after lunch to get our bets in.\\
69 - Today was totally wasted. Although he did buy me a swimsuit.\\
70 - I got a car, Reese. I finally have a car. It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.\\
71 - It's a piece of crap.\\
72 - Don't listen to him. You're magnificent.\\
73 - Lois, your hair looks beautiful.\\
74 - She's right, Lois. It's fantastic.\\
75 - Thank you. I've been getting compliments all day.\\
76 - It looks so much better.\\
77 - Yeah, I thought you were trapped in the '70s with that old cut.\\
78 - And your head doesn't look so boxy anymore.\\
79 - Lois? What did you do to your hair? I love it. Fred, isn't it fantastic?\\
80 - Mm-hmm.\\
81 - - Who's your stylist? - My husband did it.\\
82 - - Really? Where's his shop? - He doesn't have one.\\
83 - I just got the scissors out of the drawer and, I don't know, he just got inspired.\\
84 - Amazing.\\
85 - Okay, ladies, we're agreed. Lois looks beautiful. Now, let's get back to work.\\
86 - I got a job to do, too, honey.\\
87 - Good evening, Fred.\\
88 - There goes the soul of this store.\\
89 - - And it keeps your nose from taking over your face. - Yeah, thanks.\\
90 - - So I'll see you tonight? - I wouldn't miss it.\\
91 - Lois, you've got to help me.\\
92 - What?\\
93 - - I need you to cover the rest of my shift for me. - Again? Craig, what's going on?\\
94 - Paula wants to surprise Fred for their anniversary.\\
95 - He's a big golfer, so she wants to learn how, so I've been giving her lessons.\\
96 - You don't know how to golf.\\
97 - True, but somehow she got the idea that I only missed the cut at the Masters by three strokes.\\
98 - - You lied to her? - Lois, my job here is hanging by a thread.\\
99 - I thought if I could help the boss's wife surprise him with a game of golf,\\
100 - they'd end up kissing on the 18th green, and maybe I'd be in there somewhere getting the credit for it.\\
101 - Or you could just work hard at your job and then you wouldn't have to suck up.\\
102 - Lois, I don't have time for your fantasies. I'm in trouble here.\\
103 - The first few lessons we worked on driving the cart, but now she wants to know how to swing a club.\\
104 - I need to take a lesson so I can bluff my way through her lessons.\\
105 - - Craig... - Please, Lois.\\
106 - I can't lose this job. This is the only true thing on my resume.\\
107 - All right, but I'm only...\\
108 - Feldspar!\\
109 - I want all those 50-pound bags of dog food out on the floor before I get back from the warehouse.\\
110 - I'm on it.\\
111 - Thanks, Lois.\\
112 - Sorry I'm late, Hal. The grocery store was...\\
113 - Hi, Lois.\\
114 - - Hal, what are you doing? - Just giving Margie a new look.\\
115 - - I had to have him do me. Your husband's a genius. - And I get to keep the hair.\\
116 - Now where was I? Oh, my sister. Honestly, a beach condo on her salary. Who is she trying to impress?\\
117 - She's just so insecure, she always has been.\\
118 - Every year she sends a Christmas card with a picture of her family sitting on a sailboat.\\
119 - It's not even theirs.\\
120 - Uh, Lois. Do you have to do the grocery thing in here?\\
121 - So...\\
122 - They rent that boat from their horrible neighbors who, P.S., don't even know how to sail.\\
123 - What is your problem, you stupid car? You're driving me nuts.\\
124 - Where... were you?\\
125 - Oh, Stevie, good. Here, take this. If it turns over, yank it out.\\
126 - I waited... at the library.\\
127 - You should have seen her today. I was at a light and these jerks pulled up next to mewanting to race.\\
128 - I hit the gas and she just flew.\\
129 - I totally blew the doors off for four seconds before she dropped an oil pan.\\
130 - That's it!\\
131 - Malcolm, we did it. We won over $250 from... from the good grades program at school.\\
132 - Awesome. That'll pay for this.\\
133 - Isn't it beautiful? This is for you.\\
134 - I e-mailed... my chess move... days ago.\\
135 - Stevie, I don't have to do everything with you.\\
136 - Tell you what. I'll take you for a drive. That'll...\\
137 - What is your problem, you stupid car?! You're driving me nuts!\\
138 - So I'm thinking, I feel young, so why not look young?\\
139 - So I got the Botox done to crow's feet and my forehead, then I had my chin done and my tummy tucked.\\
140 - - And I may notstop there. - Work it, girlfriend.\\
141 - Oh, hi, Lois.\\
142 - Can I talk to you for a minute?\\
143 - Does your grandmother know you borrowed her hands?\\
144 - I went to six different stores and could not find that avocado oil you recommended.\\
145 - Hal, this isn't working for me.\\
146 - Well, that's because you don't scrunch and sprits like I told you to.\\
147 - No, this. Look. Craig is flaking out on me.\\
148 - I'm pulling double shifts for him and every time I come home, it's full of people.\\
149 - I never have any time alone. There is hair everywhere.\\
150 - And I do not like the way you are standing lately.\\
151 - Lois, these women are walking out of here with a glow. It's wonderful.\\
152 - Well, can't you at least some of the money you're making to hire a cleaning lady?\\
153 - - I'm not accepting money for this ! - What?!\\
154 - I am transforming these women, Lois. I won't soil that with money. And it's not just the hair.\\
155 - They confide in me, they need someone to listen to their problems.\\
156 - You wouldn't believe what some of these women are going through.\\
157 - Nancy, she's getting audited. Margie's husband has a gambling problem,\\
158 - and Paula in there, she is having an affair.\\
159 - What?!\\
160 - Yes, for the last five months. It's some guy she's pretending to take golf lessons with.\\
161 - Why do you keep doing this to me?\\
162 - I fix your throttle leakage and your alternator dies.\\
163 - I buy you a new alternator and your water pump explodes.\\
164 - Every time I think I'm getting close, you find a new way to hurt me.\\
165 - Hey, thanks for placing that bet today.\\
166 - I tried to get out of detention, but none of the fire alarms were working.\\
167 - Where's the money?\\
168 - I never made the bet.\\
169 - What?\\
170 - I didn't make the bet. I spent the money on something else.\\
171 - A car bra!\\
172 - What?\\
173 - You had $200.\\
174 - That horse came in at five to two.\\
175 - I don't know what that is, but I'm supposed to get half of it.\\
176 - Sorry, man. But look how hot she looks.\\
177 - - Malcolm, you got to calm down. This car is messing you up. - This car is not messing me up.\\
178 - It's made me happier than I've ever been in my life.\\
179 - Oh, Lois, thank God.\\
180 - Fred asked me to scrub out the Dumpsters tonight, but Paula wants to work on her short iron, so I had to schedule &an emergency lesson with the golf pro.\\
181 - The guy charges, like, 90 bucks an hour. It's really eating away at my savings, but I guess I have no one to blame but myself, and, oh, my God, you know about the affair.\\
182 - Damn it! Damn it!\\
183 - - You do know, right? - Yes, I know.\\
184 - Damn it!\\
185 - Craig, how could you lie to me after all I've done for you?\\
186 - I let you sleep on our floor when you though your cat's ghost was trying to kill you.\\
187 - - I settled that feud between you and the Girl Scout troop. - They started it.\\
188 - Shut up!\\
189 - I do all this and you repay me by making me drag around 50-pound sacks of dog food so you can sleep with the boss's wife?\\
190 - - That's inexcusable! - I didn't plan this. It just happened.\\
191 - One night after inventory, we stopped in the parking lot to talk.\\
192 - I bent down to pick up her keys, the next thing I know, she's got me handcuffed in a shower in a motel out by the airport.\\
193 - She's crazy, Lois.\\
194 - But she makes me crazy, too.\\
195 - Craig...\\
196 - I'm not kidding. There is a dark, scary place inside of me that I didn't even know was there,\\
197 - but Paula knew it was there, and every night she takes me to that scary place and shows me some new, terrible, delicious corner of it.\\
198 - - You're not going to rat on me, are you? - No, but you have to end this today.\\
199 - I can't, Lois. I'm addicted. I don't even know who I am anymore!\\
200 - I know I've let you down,\\
201 - but I want to thank you for helping me anyway.\\
202 - - Craig, I never said I... - If that homeless guy is still in the Dumpster, just let him drink from the hose. He'll leave you alone.\\
203 - Stupid car. That's four coats. Now will you run?!\\
204 - - Malcolm, your leopard-skin seat covers are here. - Sweet.\\
205 - I can't wait to see you in them.\\
206 - What's going on?\\
207 - Malcolm, this is Mike.\\
208 - He's from AAA.\\
209 - You're in a safe place with people who care about you.\\
210 - Sit down, son.\\
211 - What's all this about?\\
212 - Stevie and Reese have something to say and I think you should listen.\\
213 - You've abandoned... your friends.\\
214 - You didn't even notice my new... deck shoes.\\
215 - - Stevie, I've just been busy, okay? - Your car is ruining everything.\\
216 - It's even affecting our illegal gambling.\\
217 - I tried to pick a winner myself,\\
218 - but since I'm an idiot, I picked one that came in at over 600 to one.\\
219 - I won $11,500 that I can't even touch because I'd have to fill out a tax form!\\
220 - $11,500 that's just sitting there tormenting me because of that stupid car!\\
221 - Stop calling it stupid!\\
222 - That car isn't stupid. That car is great.\\
223 - It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.\\
224 - - Really? Where'd you get that shiner? - That was my fault. I wasn't being careful enough.\\
225 - Malcolm, we're here to help,\\
226 - but the first step is for you to admit that you have a problem.\\
227 - I did. That's why I'm in AAA.\\
228 - There's thousands of us, Malcolm, and we all know what you're going through.\\
229 - I guess I didn't realizehow bad things had gotten.\\
230 - I think I need to take a good long look at every...\\
231 - Oh, yeah. Oh, that's it.\\
232 - I didn't get... to read...\\
233 - my poem.\\
234 - And when Martha left the room, Tina checked the price tag on the leather coat...\\
235 - factory outlet.\\
236 - Temperature good for you?\\
237 - Perfect. As was the scalp massage.\\
238 - So all you have to do is cash in the ticket for me, give me the $11,000, and you can keep $500.\\
239 - - Deal. - Thanks, man.\\
240 - Well, I think it's important you have an adult you can trust.\\
241 - This car is a tease.\\
242 - Yesterday, she gave me the ride of my life.\\
243 - Her bra flew off before I even hit the freeway.\\
244 - I was so happy!\\
245 - And today, she won't even start.\\
246 - It's like yesterday didn't even happen.\\
247 - I can't take this anymore!\\
248 - Please start!\\
249 - Please, I'm begging you! Just give me a little something, please?!\\
250 - Oh, thank you so much! I knew you'd come back.\\
251 - We're meant to be together. Don't you see?\\
252 - Help! Somebody help me!\\
253 - I'm stuck!\\
254 - Help!\\
255 - There's a bit of a wait. We got slammed with a wedding party and we're way behind.\\
256 - Huh, The Human Volcano. One of my favorites.\\
257 - - Oh, it's so much better now that he can read minds. - Exactly.\\
258 - He used to just have heat grip. How lame was that?\\
259 - - You allergic to nuts? - No.\\
260 - All right.\\
261 - What are you studying in school?\\
262 - Regular stuff, I guess.\\
263 - I don't really like school.\\
264 - Everybody makes fun of me.\\
265 - Yeah, I remember those days. Kids can be so cruel.\\
266 - The smart kids, the loners, they were the meanest.\\
267 - The worst is gym class. My own team throws the ball at me in dodgeball.\\
268 - Hey, you know how you can get out of gym? Pretend to have asthma.\\
269 - All you need is a fake inhaler. Here, take mine.\\
270 - It also gets me good seats on the bus.\\
271 - Don't worry.\\
272 - Things are going to be better for you from here on out.\\
273 - My dad tells me the same thing.\\
274 - Well, your dad's a smart man.\\
275 - Frank, your new haircut looks great.\\
276 - Let me just get my purse and I'll drive you back home to your parents.\\
277 - Craig, you know Frank's parents, Fred and Paula.\\
278 - Remember, Fred is our boss at Lucky Aide?\\
279 - And I believe you're giving golf lessons to his mom.\\
280 - Let's go, Frank.\\
281 - And I promise I'll drive very safely so we don't have an accident.\\
282 - I wouldn't want to ruin your life with my carelessness.\\
283 - I'm not going to make it.\\
284 - Stevie was right about this car.\\
285 - And so was Reese.\\
286 - He was right about the car,\\
287 - and the horse racing.\\
288 - That makes it easier.\\
289 - I don't...\\
290 - want to live in a world...\\
291 - where Reese is right.\\
292 - You really have to snap those sheets if you want to get the hair off.\\
293 - - Come on. Throw your fanny into it. - Dad, seriously, you got to stop talking like that.\\
294 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
295 - It's just so draining listening to all these people with their tawdry little secrets.\\
296 - Like that Paula woman, Fred's wife?\\
297 - Not only is she cheating on her husband, now she's two-timing on her golf instructor with her swing-dance teacher.\\
298 - She is learning new moves every night if you know what I'm talking about. She is so cold.\\
299 - - Hey! - Stevie, please, we're talking.\\
300 - And Sheila's husband Randy just got a new assistant. She's 19 years old and she doesn't even know how to type.\\
301 - The girl wears a halter top to the office.\\
302 - Halter tops?\\
303 - Hello? Dukes of Hazzard on line three. They want their costumes back.\\
304 - Malcolm? Malcolm, are you all right?\\
305 - What happened?\\
306 - It's okay. It's okay, son. You'll be fine. Just breathe deep.\\
307 - Stevie...\\
308 - you saved my life.\\
309 - I treated you like dirt. You saved my life.\\
310 - Your wheel's kinda on my crotch.\\
311 - Is it?\\
312 - I can get off early, can't you just cancel your lesson?\\
313 - I wish I could, but we're working on the Texas Two-Step tonight.\\
314 - We never see each other anymore.\\
315 - Lois, I see you more than I see my wife these days.\\
316 - Oh, Fred, things have a way of changing for the better.\\
317 - You'll see.\\
318 - Attention, Lucky Aide shoppers:\\
319 - My name is Craig Feldspar and I have a message for Paula Lynch.\\
320 - Paula, I can't go on like this.\\
321 - I'm going to do the right thing,\\
322 - and make you my wife.\\
323 - I just bought an $11,500 engagement ring which I hope you'll accept.\\
324 - You're cheating on me with Craig Feldspar?!\\
325 - I think we're both victims here, Fred.\\
326 - I'm going to go...\\
327 - something that way.\\
328 - Sure, it won't be easy for us, but the path of true love never did run smooth.\\
329 - We'll move in with my grandmother and care for her together.\\
330 - Well, they're about to tow her away. You want to come say good-bye?\\
331 - No.\\
332 - I know it's tough, son.\\
333 - I thought I'd never get over my first car.\\
334 - '64 Plymouth Fury who couldn't keep her top on.\\
335 - Then some guy stole her from me.\\
336 - I saw her a few months later with a new driver and a different paint job, but,\\
337 - she meant nothing to me.\\
338 - I had moved on.\\
339 - And so will you.\\
340 - Are you cutting my hair?\\
341 - No.

16 - I tell you, I am never disappointed in Value Village.\\
17 - No other place in the county has such a selection of irregulars.\\
18 - Are these made in some country where people aren't symmetrical?\\
19 - Stop complaining.\\
20 - If it weren't for Value Village, most of this family would have to run around naked.\\
21 - That place is all that separates us from the apes.\\
22 - Oh, for crying out loud.\\
23 - What? I was not! You look great!\\
24 - The Paysons Outlet has 48-packs of paper towels for half price.\\
25 - I wish we had more room in this car.\\
26 - I knew we should have put the rack on top...\\

32 - You've been sitting on that couch watching TV for hours.\\

38 - You could take a walk, you could roll a hoop, you can start a rock collection. There.\\
39 - That's three ideas in five seconds. I hope you're embarrassed.\\
40 - You boys have no idea how lucky you are.\\
41 - The day will come where you won't be able to complain about having nothing to do.\\

46 - I hate to admit it, but Mom challenged us to use our creativity, and I think we're better for it.\\
47 - How much time do we have before the lights come on?\\
48 - We've got a few minutes.\\
49 - Let's give her crazy eyes, Dracula fangs, and a giant fart cloud.\\
50 - Eh. Feels done.\\
51 - We went to all the trouble to get up here.\\
52 - Let's really think about...\\
53 - Reese!\\
54 - What are you writing?\\
55 - "I want Reese."\\
56 - Come on. You know she's thinking it.\\
57 - How are we supposed to get away with this if you put your name up there?\\
58 - Relax. We're miles from our house.\\
59 - Nobody here knows us.\\
60 - Oh, my God!\\
61 - Did you hear something?\\
62 - What are you boys doing up there?\\
63 - It's Mom!\\
64 - How'd she know where to find us?\\
65 - I told you she's got tracking devices in our feelings!\\
66 - If you two geniuses had ripped them out like I did, we wouldn't be in this mess!\\
67 - - Maybe she didn't see us. - Reese, Malcolm, Dewey!\\
68 - You get down here this instant!\\
69 - Missus, I don't know who you are thinking we are.\\
70 - Your boys are very different boys than we are being.\\
71 - Oh, no!\\
72 - Where's the back door on this thing?\\
73 - It's a billboard!\\
74 - We are so dead!\\
75 - This time she'll finish us!\\
76 - What are we gonna do?!\\
77 - Oh, God! Oh, God!\\
78 - Why do billboards have to be so visible?\\
79 - Come down now!\\
80 - Reese, give me your pocket knife.\\
81 - Okay... But if you miss her, you'll only make her madder.\\
82 - What are you doing?\\
83 - Hold on. I know that look.\\
84 - He's using his brain.\\
85 - We can't come down because we are...\\
86 - protesting this offensive depiction of women!\\
87 - What?!\\
88 - What?!\\
89 - We've come up here to make a difference in the world!\\
90 - Yeah!\\
91 - To speak for women like this one who can't speak for themselves!\\
92 - Yeah, because they're billboards!\\
93 - Shut up.\\
94 - We're not coming down until women everywhere get the respect they deserve!\\
95 - No matter how long it takes, we're staying up here!\\
96 - Oh, for the love of God. I don't know who you think you're fooling.\\
97 - - It's about time! - Thank you, boys! - God bless you!\\
98 - Oh, no.\\
99 - She's talking to the cops.\\
100 - Wait, that's good.\\
101 - If she gets ahold of us, she'll have to beat us within the law.\\
102 - All these people showing up is making her madder and madder.\\
103 - Why didn't we just climb down right away?\\
104 - What were you thinking?\\
105 - I don't know. I panicked.\\
106 - I want to know what you're going to do to get my boys down.\\
107 - It's a complicated situation, ma'am. We have very specific guidelines for how to deal with political protesters.\\
108 - They're not political protesters.\\
109 - Those boys don't give a damn about women's rights!\\
110 - If they did, they'd clean up their rooms once in a while!\\
111 - This is hooliganism!\\
112 - Sorry it took me so long.\\
113 - Eight different baby-sitters turned me down.\\
114 - Do you know Jamie's on a website?\\
115 - Where are the boys?\\
116 - I told you.\\
117 - Oh, good God!\\
118 - I thought it was a metaphor.\\
119 - I'm sure you have ladders. I'm sure you have people who climb them.\\
120 - So get one of them up there and get my children down!\\
121 - Ma'am, let me explain something about the Police Commissioner.\\
122 - This is an election year.\\
123 - We've had a lot of unflattering video on the news lately.\\
124 - The Chang case, the Jefferson case, the Rodriguez case. All he has left is the white vote.\\
125 - So he's not going to let a bunch of video cameras tape us manhandling those children.\\
126 - But if there's anything else that we can do for you...\\
127 - Yeah, how about you call a cop?\\
128 - Sorry, Officer. It's not you, it's me.\\
129 - I have a severe gambling problem. Lost the house playing Pai-Gow.\\
130 - She's a saint. Would you excuse us a moment?\\
131 - Honey, calm down.\\
132 - You know what pepper spray feels like.\\
133 - Let's just give it an hour or two.\\
134 - When these people lose interest and the crowd disperses, we'll get the boys down.\\
135 - That's right, Steven. I'm here at the scene of this dramatic demonstration...\\
136 - In an age of cynicism when it's said that young people don't care about the important issues...\\
137 - These three youngsters seem to have struck a nerve among like-minded citizens who've had enough of this degrading depiction of women.\\
138 - Lois, did you see all the news vans?\\
139 - Lyle at Seven told me to get out of his shot.\\
140 - He is one handsome man.\\
141 - Over here we have the proud mother of these three young protesters.\\
142 - What do you want the nation to know about your boys?\\
143 - No comment.\\
144 - So you must be the father? Can we get some comment from you?\\
145 - I, I don't know that I really want to sound off.\\
146 - How do you account for your sons' extraordinary sensitivity to women's issues?\\
147 - Well, Dinah, in our house we emphasize the rights of all people.\\
148 - I've tried to pass along what I like to call "core values."\\
149 - Equality, respect, compassion, nutrition.\\
150 - We have something called the Clean Plate Club.\\
151 - What's that cop doing?\\
152 - I think he's throwing something.\\
153 - Oh my God!\\
154 - What is it?\\
155 - It's a cell phone.\\
156 - Hello.\\
157 - Hello.\\
158 - Mom?\\
159 - Before you say anything, I want you to listen carefully.\\
160 - There are a couple ways we can handle this.\\
161 - If you come down right now, I can go as low as three weeks in your room.\\
162 - If there's no you get two meals a day and enough light to read by.\\
163 - You should think about this very carefully,\\
164 - but you've only got ten minutes until this offer expires.\\
165 - Then all bets are off.\\
166 - Oh, my God.\\
167 - I know.\\
168 - She's negotiating.\\
169 - She's never negotiated anything before.\\
170 - We found a weakness.\\
171 - All these people and the TV cameras.\\
172 - She must be scared.\\
173 - I didn't think this was possible.\\
174 - Suddenly, she looks so small.\\
175 - People,\\
176 - the battle before us may be long,\\
177 - but we will not stop until we end the oppression!\\
178 - Women of the world...\\
179 - Unite!\\
180 - I am their mother, and I say this has gone on long enough!\\
181 - Don't you have snipers with tranquilizer guns or a giant net?!\\
182 - - What do I pay taxes for? - No, the life of a crusader is not an easy one,\\
183 - but once that fire is lit, there is no putting it out.\\
184 - Feminism must be very important &to your boys.\\
185 - Meryl, please! They're not my "boys." They're my children.\\
186 - If you feel the need to label them, I'm sorry for you.\\
187 - It's high time we showed a national audience...\\
188 - This is national?\\
189 - ... that we're still producing heroes in this country, and three of them are up there!\\
190 - It's your sons, ma'am.\\
191 - Well, you're cutting it awfully close.\\
192 - I gave you ten minutes, and you've taken nearly nine and a half.\\
193 - We decided we're not coming down.\\
194 - What?!\\
195 - We discussed it as a family.\\
196 - See, we figure you're as mad now as you possibly can ever get.\\
197 - We've reached the point where nothing we do can make it any worse.\\
198 - So every hour we stay up here is another hour of freedom.\\
199 - Plus another 30 or 40 supporters added to our fan base.\\
200 - Malcolm, let's set aside the fact that you know you've done wrong.\\
201 - Let's ignore that you're pretending to have principles you don't have just to get out of it.\\
202 - You have to come down sometime.\\
203 - And life is long.\\
204 - That's what's nice about being young.\\
205 - We really don't think that far ahead.\\
206 - This whole thing's been kind of eye-opening.\\
207 - If nothing else, we've all had a lesson on the ephemeral nature of power.\\
208 - Power's a funny thing.\\
209 - It's when you think you have it that you're in trouble.\\
210 - Valid point.\\
211 - Historically.\\
212 - But on a philosophical level, Mom...\\
213 - we've already won.\\
214 - We're free.\\
215 - And no matter what happens tonight,\\
216 - we both know it.\\
217 - I think it's getting cold up here.\\
218 - I don't think we should do this anymore.\\
219 - I don't know who we think we're kidding.\\
220 - - We're not going to be able to win this... - Dewey,\\
221 - don't look into her eyes!\\
222 - Huh?\\
223 - What just happened?\\
224 - Damn it.\\
225 - I remember my mother, smart as any man,\\
226 - down on her knees in the kitchen, scrubbing that floor 'til it shined.\\
227 - - I think I was seven when I made a promise to myself and to all women... - Hal?\\
228 - Yes.\\
229 - Oh, my God.\\
230 - I saw you on TV tonight, and I couldn't believe it was you,\\
231 - but you kept talking and talking and talking.\\
232 - And I realized it had to be you.\\
233 - Wendy...\\
234 - - How long's it been? - 23 years, Hal.\\
235 - You know, I remember the last time I saw you down to the day and the minute. I can tell you exactly where I was standing...\\
236 - Wendy!\\
237 - That was so long ago. I've got a whole new life now.\\
238 - - You can't just come here and expect... - Promises were made, Hal.\\
239 - And now that I found you, I'm not just gonna go away.\\
240 - Look, I know that there are some issues that probably need resolving...\\
241 - Listen, honey, let's get a cup of coffee way over there.\\
242 - No. I have an idea.\\
243 - Is this going up to the boys?\\
244 - Yes, it's some baked goods, some jackets for when it gets cold... and my phone number.\\
245 - Oh, this is wonderful.\\
246 - You certainly went to a lot of trouble.\\
247 - My boys are just going to be so appreciative of your kindness.\\
248 - I think the Green Valley Women's Collective makes better banana bread than the Feminists for Change.\\
249 - According to the wrapper, we're the first male hands to touch this.\\
250 - You know, except for Mom and Dad and Francis and Jamie,\\
251 - I think this has really brought our family together.\\
252 - What are you doing?\\
253 - What?\\
254 - You know what.\\
255 - Why do you get the one with the cherry?\\
256 - I just grabbed one. I don't care.\\
257 - If you don't care, then let me have it.\\
258 - I already took it.\\
259 - Hey, I'm here, too. I want the cherry.\\
260 - You always do this.\\
261 - You only want it because I have it.\\
262 - I don't care what you have.\\
263 - Reese, you're not the center of everything...\\
264 - Wait.\\
265 - Why would they only put a cherry on one cupcake?\\
266 - This is Mom.\\
267 - There may be those who will try to drive a wedge between us.\\
268 - But if we learn nothing else tonight, we will learn to stand together!\\
269 - Damn it.\\
270 - We have a pretty sweet deal up here. Food, drinks.\\
271 - Everyone of our needs is being taken care of.\\
272 - Everyone.\\
273 - Man, they better stop sending up bran muffins.\\
274 - Hey! You may want to burn this basket!\\
275 - How are the books they gave us?\\
276 - The feminist joke book's a little ham-fisted, but these fairy tales are interesting.\\
277 - In this one, Cinderella tells the Prince he's sapping her woman-strength,\\
278 - and she pushes him aside to create a matriarchy with fluid gender roles.\\
279 - Can you believe these cows actually think we're on their side ?\\
280 - We love you, boys!\\
281 - Right on, sister!\\
282 - Check out that pig.\\
283 - You don't have to talk about them like that.\\
284 - They've been really nice to us.\\
285 - Yeah, and they really believe in this stuff.\\
286 - That is such a load.\\
287 - Every woman down there is just here because they're jealous.\\
288 - Of what?\\
289 - Of the fact that they're not hot enough to be strippers.\\
290 - They act like they're all offended, but really they're just mad about their own giant butts.\\
291 - Believe me, in their heart of hearts, every woman wants to be her.\\
292 - - What about Mom? - We're not talking about moms.\\
293 - We're talking about women.\\
294 - So all women want to be strippers?\\
295 - There are no women in the world who want to be doctors or lawyers or anything like that?\\
296 - Cut the act, Malcolm. They can't hear you.\\
297 - Just because they look like dogs doesn't mean they hear like dogs.\\
298 - I'm sleeping on the other side.\\
299 - Come on, I was just being honest!\\
300 - So whipped.\\
301 - Where are the heroes who fight for a cause?\\
302 - Who live by the code of their own moral laws?\\
303 - Who stand up to tyrants and fight the police?\\
304 - Like Gandhi and Martin and Bobby and Rosa...\\
305 - And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese?\\
306 - And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese.\\
307 - Reese?\\
308 - Reese.\\
309 - Hi.\\
310 - I've been wanting to talk to you.\\
311 - Really?\\
312 - Yeah, sugar.\\
313 - I had to wait for your brothers to go to sleep.\\
314 - You don't want to share me, do you?\\
315 - Everyone's mad at me.\\
316 - Malcolm and Dewey think I'm a jerk.\\
317 - You're not a jerk. You're just little.\\
318 - I think you're cute as a bug.\\
319 - Do you want me to kiss you?\\
320 - Uh... yes, ma'am.\\
321 - Wow.\\
322 - Damn tootin' wow.\\
323 - So, will you take off your giant top?\\
324 - Do you have a giant dollar?\\
325 - I'll get a whole bunch if you'll come back again.\\
326 - I'll come back every night if you want.\\
327 - You're so great.\\
328 - The girls at school won't even talk to me.\\
329 - Listen, if they're not willing to talk to you or dance on a pole, they're not really your friends.\\
330 - You don't need them.\\
331 - You have me.\\
332 - I'm perfect.\\
333 - I'm the only woman in the world for you, Reese.\\
334 - You are?\\
335 - Of course.\\
336 - I'm 60 feet tall.\\
337 - My skin is five inches thick.\\
338 - No matter how creepy and insensitive and thoughtless you are, you can't hurt me.\\
339 - That's all I ever wanted.\\
340 - Why aren't all women like you?\\
341 - Well, I'm not real, sugar.\\
342 - Oh, yeah.\\
343 - You just dreamed me up as a super-sexy way to face the fact that you're going to live the rest of your life alone.\\
344 - But that's not for sure, is it?\\
345 - And you know the saddest part?\\
346 - You're gonna wake up before you can think of anything really good to do with me.\\
347 - Wait.\\
348 - We can't just give up on this.\\
349 - Wait.\\
350 - Don't leave me.\\
351 - Don't leave me!\\
352 - Right now the mother of the protesters is with the Police Commissioner, pleading for her brave boys whose sacrifice continues to inspire so many.\\
353 - Those boys are like dogs.\\
354 - I have to get them on their backs just to reestablish my dominance.\\
355 - Look, this whole protest thing is a lie anyway. They don't believe a word of it.\\
356 - If it's an issue of liability, I'll sign any waiver.\\
357 - Just get them down here!\\
358 - Do I appear to look concerned?\\
359 - What?\\
360 - Yeah, sure, you look concerned.\\
361 - Oh, thank God.\\
362 - My handlers say that I don't pull it off.\\
363 - Can't do the mouth.\\
364 - I want those boys down.\\
365 - Believe me, there is nothing I would like more than to tear 'em down and crack a few heads.\\
366 - But in an election year we all have to make sacrifices.\\
367 - You know, this whole thing brings me back to my days on the Freedom Ride.\\
368 - It's fantastic. We're getting an injunction.\\
369 - What?\\
370 - The ACLU found a judge who's completely sympathetic to what your boys are doing.\\
371 - In two hours, we'll have an airtight court order and your boys can stay up there for days, even weeks.\\
372 - Excuse me, I have something to say.\\
373 - I want the world to know how proud I am of my boys for making this statement,\\
374 - despite the wind and the cold and little Dewey's medical condition.\\
375 - And I want to thank the Police Commissioner for letting my son stay up there, even if it means rolling the dice on a diabetic coma.\\
376 - It's nice to see someone who cares about principles more than they care about the life of a little boy.\\
377 - Get 'em down.\\
378 - Malcolm!\\
379 - Reese!\\
380 - Oh, my God!\\
381 - We'll have you in your mother's arms in a minute, little Dewey!\\
382 - No!\\
383 - Excuse me, are you Hal's wife?\\
384 - Yeah, this is, uh...\\
385 - There's something you need to know about your husband.\\
386 - We both worked at the Tiger Shop at Macy's.\\
387 - One night he got me drunk and...\\
388 - borrowed $400 from me!\\
389 - What?\\
390 - He bought a velour suit and faked his own death to get out of paying me back.\\
391 - He actually blew up a phone booth.\\
392 - I figure with interest it comes to about ten grand.\\
393 - I'm sorry, but...\\
394 - Hey! Hey, everybody!\\
395 - You can take us down, but first I have something to say.\\
396 - I realized something up here.\\
397 - This woman is beautiful, she's sexy, and perfect and gigantic, but you know what?\\
398 - She isn't real.\\
399 - If she was real, she'd be different.\\
400 - I know that if I was real, I'd want people to listen to me.\\
401 - I'd want people to care about what I think and not ignore me.\\
402 - I guess what these protesters are trying to say is,\\
403 - that women, real women, aren't that different from regular people.\\
404 - They want the same things that men want.\\
405 - Only men don't have to hold a big protest to get them.\\
406 - And women shouldn't have to either.\\
407 - Well, I'm very proud of you boys.\\
408 - Let's go home where I can truly express how I'm feeling.\\
409 - I've had six hours to figure out all the horrible things that are going to happen to you.\\
410 - You, I still have to think about.\\
411 - Get him to Deaconess Diabetic Center right away.\\
412 - Dad! Tell them what's going on!\\
413 - - Tell them I'm not... - He's fading! Let's go! Let's go!
\subsection {Episode 11: Dewey's Opera}
1 - Hal, did you baby-proof the kitchen like I asked you to?\\
2 - I'm doing it right now.\\
3 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.11 - Dewey's Opera Synchronisation par Tyno, Script original par Raceman. Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
4 - This is so boring.\\
5 - It's your fault for inviting Stevie over.\\
6 - He can't do anything, so we can't do anything, and it's always boring and lame.\\
7 - Reese, he's not deaf.\\
8 - I have...\\
9 - my fun.\\
10 - This is exactly what I'm talking about.\\
11 - This would be fun if I were looking at it.\\
12 - When you read it, it's not fun; it's sad.\\
13 - Now I'm bored and sad. Thanks a lot, Stevie!\\
14 - Reese!\\
15 - No, it's horrible.\\
16 - I think it sucks that he always gets his face rubbed in the fact that he will never get to enjoy anything.\\
17 - Maybe he'd be happier if they stuck you in some kind of special tank.\\
18 - Whoa, check this out!\\
19 - What?\\
20 - Street-luging!\\
21 - Look at those pictures!\\
22 - "Police call it the most reckless, dangerous teen craze in years."\\
23 - It says they look back with fondness on the crack epidemic.\\
24 - We could totally build a board like that!\\
25 - Except we wouldn't.\\
26 - Because our parents wouldn't allow it.\\
27 - So, since we're not doing it, no one has to say anything.\\
28 - Yes, this sport seems immature, and frankly, I just think it's uncool.\\
29 - Hey, Stevie, look, Pentominos.\\
30 - Why were we bored?\\
31 - So, you just bought a new bed, just like that.\\
32 - Hal, we had that smelly, saggy old one for 20 years. It's time for a new one.\\
33 - This one is certainly bigger.\\
34 - Yeah. It's king-sized. They're a little bigger.\\
35 - So you'll be further away.\\
36 - I guess. Maybe a couple inches.\\
37 - So, is that the reason?\\
38 - You want there to be more distance between us?\\
39 - Hal, I didn't really think about the size. It was on sale at Mattress King.\\
40 - I guess you couldn't pass up a deal like that, huh?\\
41 - It's just interesting to learn how it starts.\\
42 - How what starts?\\
43 - Well, first you buy the king-size bed, the largest bed made.\\
44 - But then of course, at some point, even the giant bed doesn't put enough distance between you and the hideous monster.\\
45 - So you start sleeping in another room. Then soon, we're barely exchanging pleasantries, and then one day you say,\\
46 - "Hal, let's just say what we're both thinking."\\
47 - And then, I end up eating alone on a Formica table under a swinging lightbulb while you,\\
48 - are on a beach in Ibiza being rubbed with cocoa butter by your new lover who you can never get too close to!\\
49 - Hal, it's a bed!\\
50 - The old one was horrible. This one is nice.\\
51 - Look, I know this is a big change for you.\\
52 - So I'm just going to have to think of some way to make you very, very happy in this bed.\\
53 - Good luck!\\
54 - I'm here to snitch.\\
55 - Reese and Malcolm are in the garage.\\
56 - They won't let me in, but they're building something.\\
57 - If you want help in the penalty phase, let me know.\\
58 - Dewey, I am not going to go in there and have a big fight with the boys because you've got nothing to do.\\
59 - We have a rule in this family about what we do when we're bored.\\
60 - I don't care if they are your skateboard wheels. We're not putting a "No Fat Chicks" sticker on it.\\
61 - All right, but it's still our policy.\\
62 - What're you crying about?\\
63 - I was just sitting there and this, this opera came on.\\
64 - People screaming and hating.\\
65 - It was our family, but with music!\\
66 - And they all mixed together in a counterpoint that underscored the futility of their lives!\\
67 - And the stretto showed the minor key had been hiding in the subdominant from the very first bar.\\
68 - All I understood was,\\
69 - "Hit me, Reese. Hit me and never stop hitting me."\\
70 - Yeah, well, that was the gist of it.\\
71 - The animals in the farm include, but are not limited to, the cow, the horse, the pig, the chicken, the sheep.\\
72 - Dewey, the algebra homework you gave us, did you want us to show our work?\\
73 - Huh? I dunno.\\
74 - Just a sec.\\
75 - ... the alpaca,\\
76 - You okay?\\
77 - You want to wrap your hands in tinfoil?\\
78 - I have nothing!\\
79 - I want to write an opera.\\
80 - I know I can do it.\\
81 - I have all the music.\\
82 - I can hear it in my head.\\
83 - I just don't have a story to hang it on.\\
84 - It has to be something so dramatic it's like a knife in the heart.\\
85 - ... the peccary, the hog bear,\\
86 - That's the trouble with being a kid.\\
87 - I want a dog.\\
88 - I don't have a dog.\\
89 - But ultimately, so what?\\
90 - The sounds produced by said animals are, respectively: moo, neigh, oink, cluck, gobble, silent.\\
91 - I don't see anyone.\\
92 - Are you sure this is the right place?\\
93 - I don't know.\\
94 - It was a pretty reputable extreme sport chat room.\\
95 - Hey!\\
96 - Is it cool if we ride with you?\\
97 - All right! This is gonna be fun!\\
98 - Nope.\\
99 - That's not gonna happen.\\
100 - Too steep, too dangerous. I might die.\\
101 - Call me a girl. I don't care.\\
102 - You know what? I'm gonna try it.\\
103 - Are you serious, dude?\\
104 - It's too steep.\\
105 - Your face will be like an inch from the asphalt.\\
106 - No, I'm pretty sure I can do this.\\
107 - Malcolm, seriously. Think about this.\\
108 - I don't want you killed or brain-damaged.\\
109 - You're my brother and...\\
110 - Hey, this isn't bad. I'm actually having fun.\\
111 - Wow.\\
112 - I think I'm gonna turn out to be a really good luger.\\
113 - The whole unpopular thing will be just a funny story about my days pre-luge.\\
114 - I bet I'll get my own line of clothing.\\
115 - Maybe a girlfriend. Maybe two.\\
116 - They'd fight over me, but I'd make them work it out.\\
117 - Someone owes me an extreme apology!\\
118 - Hey!\\
119 - Hey, you! Jerk!\\
120 - You totally made me crash!\\
121 - Just because you can blow a lot of money on some high-end luge doesn't mean you're not a jerk!\\
122 - You're just a rich jerk.\\
123 - Jerk!\\
124 - Aha!\\
125 - Hal!\\
126 - Oh, what a blind fool I've been!\\
127 - To think, when you said you didn't buy this bed to get away from me, I believed you!\\
128 - Oh, Hal, calm down!\\
129 - It's just that when you sleep you're so hot, you radiate heat. You're like a giant radiator!\\
130 - And when I sleep, I need to flop my arms around and I can't do that if you're on top of me!\\
131 - How long have you found me hideous?\\
132 - For God's sakes, this is why I have to lie to you all the time!\\
133 - Did you ever love me?\\
134 - Who are you?\\
135 - Fair warning, Hal.\\
136 - If you wake that baby up, he is yours for the night!\\
137 - A sale at Mattress King?! Oh...\\
138 - You must have laughed at me for swallowing that one!\\
139 - They don't know the meaning of the word "sale" over there.\\
140 - Their everyday prices are guaranteed rock-bottom!\\
141 - You're just working yourself up to get your own way. You always do that, Hal.\\
142 - What should I do when I know that you looked me in the face...\\
143 - And.... \\
144 - You lied?\\
145 - Don't be hysterical. You always get hysterical.\\
146 - It's called having feelings. You should know. You're an expert at faking them! \\
147 - At least mine are real!\\
148 - Hal, don't make a thing out of this!\\
149 - What should a man do, when he knows that he'll never be happy again? \\
150 - Sing a song?\\
151 - Just get a grip, Hal, don't overreact.\\
152 - Overreact? I feel horrible, I feel lousy! \\
153 - I'm having a stroke, seriously, Lois. It feels just like one.\\
154 - We think it's one, too! We're sure it's one, too!\\
155 - It's a panic attack,\\
156 - Like that time in the laundromat,\\
157 - Breathe into a pillow!\\
158 - Good idea.\\
159 - A pillow?! \\
160 - How cruel! How callous!\\
161 - Poor Hal!\\
162 - This stroke is the worst case of emotional blackmail, she's ever seen! \\
163 - And...\\
164 - I've seen plenty!\\
165 - Call 911!\\
166 - Tell them a blood vessel just burst in my brain, Just halfway between my neck and my nose.\\
167 - That's only if you care! If not, feel free To sit by while I die, and watch Leno !\\
168 - Blackmail!\\
169 - Stroke!\\
170 - Blackmail!\\
171 - Stroke!\\
172 - What a big baby!\\
173 - What a giant stroke!\\
174 - I'm not stopping till I take that guy down.\\
175 - How much skin is left on your chest?\\
176 - Enough.\\
177 - You wanted...\\
178 - to see me.\\
179 - Stevie, brace yourself.\\
180 - I'm going to tell you a really big secret about something so huge that every bone in your body is going to want to tell, but you have to promise not to.\\
181 - This is an actual street luge.\\
182 - Like from your magazine.\\
183 - Heaven... forfend.\\
184 - I need you to help me with some calculations of wheel friction and frame stiffness to get this thing perfect.\\
185 - I have to beat this rich jerk who keeps making me wipe out.\\
186 - I'm going to make a bet with him, and race him.\\
187 - You think...\\
188 - you can beat...\\
189 - this glorious...\\
190 - alpha male?\\
191 - It's going to happen.\\
192 - 'Cause I'm going to hide in the bushes and jump out at him and force him to crash.\\
193 - It may not be the most honest thing in the world, but you know what, who cares?\\
194 - This guys totally deserves it.\\
195 - I'd hate... to be him.\\
196 - Hal, get in this bed and go to sleep!\\
197 - Oh, I'll sleep, Lois. I'll sleep where I'm wanted!\\
198 - Are you coming back to bed, or should I just order a crib for you? \\
199 - I'm not coming back. I don't like to be where I'm not wanted.\\
200 - Especially if it's on a big giant bed!\\
201 - You've been on the couch for four days.\\
202 - I can hold on as long as you can.\\
203 - I have nothing to apologize for!\\
204 - Why would you? I bet they were the best four days of your life... \\
205 - No! No! No!\\
206 - You're both holding back too much.\\
207 - Glacienda, you sacrificed your future for a family that's not even grateful.\\
208 - You've got all this anger bubbling up that's ready to explode!\\
209 - And Don Argento, you have nothing in the world but that woman.\\
210 - You hate your job, you don't have friends and now you're losing her!\\
211 - Dewey.\\
212 - When it says "Jamie wets his diaper," should I really wet myself?\\
213 - No.\\
214 - But on show night?\\
215 - If the second act drags.\\
216 - Dewey, the problem is that these characters are just treading water.\\
217 - I mean, it's been four days and we've done four scenes with him on the couch.\\
218 - You're right. They're just stuck.\\
219 - What if Don Argento solves his romantic problems with a machete in a tragic, yet comedic, big bloody mess?\\
220 - Yes, I want to return a mattress I bought last week in accord with your 30-day return policy.\\
221 - Okay, I'll speak with the king.\\
222 - You're returning the bed?\\
223 - That's it?\\
224 - In what world is that an ending?\\
225 - Your father and I were arguing. It's just not worth it.\\
226 - That doesn't seem like a very satisfying resolution.\\
227 - Well, sometimes marriage is about getting by.\\
228 - You're not always satisfied with everything.\\
229 - Wow.\\
230 - I can't believe Dad was so right.\\
231 - He said if he made a big enough stink, he'd get his way.\\
232 - Well, it's a good lesson for me, though. Thanks, Mom.\\
233 - Okay. 80 bucks.\\
234 - Street rules. Which means no rules.\\
235 - And don't let yourself think about what might happen, because you don't want to get psyched out.\\
236 - And don't think about getting psyched out because you might get psyched out.\\
237 - People who get psyched out make mistakes.\\
238 - Good... advice.\\
239 - What?\\
240 - Go!\\
241 - Oh, my God, Stevie, no!\\
242 - All right, Hal, I didn't want to have to say this, but you've pushed me to it.\\
243 - What?\\
244 - There's a reason I bought a bed that was bigger.\\
245 - I did want some distance from you, but it's not because I don't love you and I don't want to be close to you.\\
246 - I don't understand.\\
247 - There are certain things that have to happen with my body at the end of the day.\\
248 - Certain events that have to... transpire.\\
249 - And if they don't transpire, I end up with stomach cramps, and I don't want it to happen two inches away from your nose.\\
250 - That's your secret?\\
251 - I know it's stupid and embarrassing and I want to be sexy for you, but after 20 years, I just have to have a break from clamping down and gritting my teeth all night.\\
252 - Oh, honey, I don't care about that.\\
253 - And it's not a secret. The second you fall asleep you let loose like a sailor.\\
254 - What?\\
255 - Oh, yeah, it's like when they put the balloons away after the Thanksgiving parade.\\
256 - Oh, my God. I can't hear anything.\\
257 - You're tunneling out.\\
258 - Honey, honey, relax.\\
259 - Honey, we're married.\\
260 - It doesn't matter how embarrassing something is.\\
261 - Because no one knows it... but me.\\
262 - Lois... \\
263 - Don't be embarrassed.\\
264 - I know...\\
265 - Everything about you.\\
266 - I know when you,\\
267 - think you're alone.\\
268 - You have to check, if your ears have grown.\\
269 - Every day, before you go to work.\\
270 - You know how I panic,\\
271 - When I see a monkey.\\
272 - I've seen you take pizza,\\
273 - From the garbage and eat it!\\
274 - I know all of you,\\
275 - You know all of me.\\
276 - But it's only us, my love !\\
277 - No one else knows.\\
278 - No one else.\\
279 - No one else.\\
280 - No one...\\
281 - Else.\\
282 - I'll return the bed.\\
283 - Honey, you've fallen asleep for a week in that bed.\\
284 - They're not gonna take it back.\\
285 - There you are. I was looking all over for you.\\
286 - Boy, I wish I was you. The worst thing in your life is taking a nap.\\
287 - You still... owe me... 80 bucks.\\
288 - Take it out of my pocket.\\
289 - Ladies and gentlemen.\\
290 - We now present a story of shame, humiliation and the deep personal secrets, that lurk within...\\
291 - "The Marriage Bed."\\
292 - Wow, everyone we know is here.\\
293 - I hope Dewey doesn't embarrass himself.
\subsection {Episode 12: Living Will}
1 - Wow, I remember this: this is Reese's fifth birthday.\\
2 - This must be Christmas the same year.\\
3 - He grew up so fast.\\
4 - He sure did.\\
5 - Here's Malcolm's first day at school.\\
6 - Oh...\\
7 - Remember when we lost Dewey at the flea market.\\
8 - Still keeps great time.\\
9 - You want to go through the arrest reports?\\

14 - Hal, do you want Raisin Bran or oatmeal?\\
15 - Oatmeal.\\
16 - No, wait... Raisin Bran.\\
17 - No, no... oatmeal.\\
18 - Oh, but Raisin Bran's got that crunch.\\
19 - And those raisins.\\
20 - But sometimes you get too many raisins. You don't have that problem with oatmeal.\\
21 - Oh, but oatmeal can be lumpy.\\
22 - But sometimes good lumpy.\\
23 - But, not usually.\\
24 - So definitely it's going to be Raisin Bran... no, eggs!\\
25 - You're having Raisin Bran.\\
26 - Oh, God, thank you.\\
27 - Hal, I don't know why you have such a hard time making decisions.\\
28 - Hal, sweetie.\\
29 - You have to decide. For your birthday, do you want a petting zoo or a clown?\\
30 - Both?\\
31 - Who knows? Probably no reason.\\
32 - You might as well ask me why I'm afraid of clowns and snakes.\\
33 - Good morning, everybody.\\
34 - Hey, Craig.\\
35 - Thanks for offering me a ride to work today. That's nice of you.\\
36 - My pleasure.\\
37 - Hey, gee whiz, you know who I haven't seen in the longest time? Your boys.\\
38 - I think I'll just drop in and say an innocent hello.\\
39 - Hey, boys, what do you say the four of us have a giant tickle party?!\\
40 - Okay, that was just a cover I didn't want to alarm your parents.\\
41 - What's going on?\\
42 - I need you guys to teach me how to fight.\\
43 - There's this jerk who's always picking on me, and I'm sick of it.\\
44 - Why are you asking us?\\
45 - Because this guy's stronger and faster than me.\\
46 - The only chance I've got is if I fight dirty.\\
47 - And let's face it, your family is legendary for that.\\
48 - Well, people exaggerate...\\
49 - Please, you've got to teach me everything you know.\\
50 - I don't think that's such a great idea.\\
51 - I mean, I teach you some tricks, you teach them to someone else, he teaches them to another guy and sooner or later, I'm in a fair fight.\\
52 - Sorry, Craig.\\
53 - What am I supposed to do?\\
54 - I came to you guys asking for help because that's what I thought friends do for their friends.\\
55 - - Dude, calm down. - I though xxx to each other.\\
56 - I mean, after all these years, after everything I've done for you...\\
57 - - Craig, stop it. - I can't help it.\\
58 - Okay. I guess we can teach you a few move. Just stop crying.\\
59 - Really?\\
60 - I mean, you're not just saying that? You'll teach me how to fight dirty?\\
61 - Yes. But you're gonna have to fully commit to this.\\
62 - And you need to know that once you start training with us, you're gonna see the world differently.\\
63 - And there's nothing we can ever do to restore your innocence.\\
64 - Thank you so much.\\
65 - You guys are the best.\\
66 - You hug me, and the lesson starts right now.\\
67 - Hi. I'm Peter Rubin from Bernstein, Wyatt and McCormick.\\
68 - Are you Hal?\\
69 - Look, I'll tell you what I tell all the other lawyers.\\
70 - Look around. This skeleton has been picked clean. But go ahead, sue away.\\
71 - Actually, that's not why I'm here.\\
72 - I'll leave you a copy of the will to go through on your own, but the bottom line is that Mr. Edelman has given you power of attorney.\\
73 - The family on the corner with the boat on the lawn?\\
74 - I barely even knew the man. Why would he give me power of attorney?\\
75 - Well, there are some difficult family issues involved, and he wanted someone impartial.\\
76 - Apparently, he considers everyone else in the neighborhood a friend.\\
77 - So I'm the one that has to decide how all his stuff gets divided?\\
78 - What? No.\\
79 - Oh, thank God.\\
80 - No, he's not dead. He's in a coma on life support.\\
81 - You have to decide whether or not to pull the plug.\\
82 - What am I going to do?\\
83 - A man's life is in my hands.\\
84 - This isn't paper or plastic. This is life or death.\\
85 - There's nothing more life or death than life or death.\\
86 - Hal, calm down. Panicking isn't going to help.\\
87 - You know, this is all your fault.\\
88 - What?!\\
89 - I am completely unprepared for this. I've had no practice. I haven't made a decision around here in years.\\
90 - When exactly did it get to the point where you make all the decisions in our marriage?\\
91 - When you said, "Lois, I want you to make all the decisions in our marriage."\\
92 - Well, you didn't have to listen to me.\\
93 - Oh, I got all this stuff racing through my mind. I, I can't eat, I can't sleep...\\
94 - Oh, Hal, if you want, I'll make the decision for you.\\
95 - No.\\
96 - I was given this responsibility.\\
97 - A man entrusted his fate in my hands. I can't just shrug that off.\\
98 - I can do this.\\
99 - I just need to focus my mind on the problem and think clearly.\\
100 - Yes.\\
101 - I've got it!\\
102 - Lois, I have made the decision.\\
103 - Want to guess what it is?\\
104 - Hal.\\
105 - Oh, all right.\\
106 - I'll keep trying.\\
107 - Craig, I'd like to welcome you to the first day of your new, more vicious life.\\
108 - I give you... the human body.\\
109 - For clarity, we've divided it into the three major theaters of operation.\\
110 - The head.\\
111 - The torso.\\
112 - And what are those?\\
113 - You know what those are.\\
114 - Now the first thing you need to know is that this is all about pride.\\
115 - Do you have pride, Craig?\\
116 - Yes.\\
117 - Okay, that is not the answer I was looking for.\\
118 - You show me a man with pride, and I'll show you a man with limited options.\\
119 - Let's say that this is your opponent, and he's coming after you.\\
120 - Hey, man, we can work this out. I didn't know she was your girl.\\
121 - See? Now he's blind, and you have the time to really get creative.\\
122 - Personally, I like to leave at least one sense intact so he knows what's happening to him.\\
123 - I knew I came to the right place.\\
124 - Okay, Dewey, you're up.\\
125 - Okay, first, I'm going to need you to take off your glasses.\\
126 - Ow! My eyes!\\
127 - I didn't know we were starting!\\
128 - There is no starting in dirty fighting.\\
129 - Life is one big fight from the day you're born to the day you die.\\
130 - Okay. Maybe we should slow down a little.\\
131 - Ow!\\
132 - Time out! Time out!\\
133 - I think we're wasting our time here.\\
134 - Let's just kick him in the kidneys and call it a night.\\
135 - No! Please!\\
136 - I know I suck, but I want to be better.\\
137 - Please. I'll try harder, I promise.\\
138 - Let me try something.\\
139 - All right, Craig, listen.\\
140 - I want you to think.\\
141 - I want you to visualize every bully that ever picked on you or beat you up.\\
142 - Really see the look of contempt on their faces as they pounded on you.\\
143 - - You got it? - Mm-hmm.\\
144 - Now, picture what they were looking at.\\
145 - Oh. It's disgusting!\\
146 - Is he going for the plums?\\
147 - It appears so.\\
148 - Well, he sure won't have to worry about the guy's children coming after him.\\
149 - Look at him.\\
150 - He can't even move, and still you can see how much he's suffering.\\
151 - Lying there, enduring the pain, hour after endless hour.\\
152 - You can see in his face he's just begging to be put out of his misery.\\
153 - - It's awful. - Oh God, yes.\\
154 - Look at him. Look how hard he's fighting.\\
155 - Those clenched hands, the set of his jaw. It's inspiring to see such a fierce will to live.\\
156 - He really wants to make it.\\
157 - It's beautiful. He's really gonna...\\
158 - Here's extra pudding if...\\
159 - Okay, it was a good plan having the guy meet you here.\\
160 - We've set up a few things to give you a little edge if you get in trouble.\\
161 - There's a broken bottle in that pile of leaves, and a can of bug spray under the Big Wheel.\\
162 - - If it runs out, it still makesa great blunt object. - Remember, we're here for you.\\
163 - Unless it looks like you're getting a total beating. Then I may have to take his side.\\
164 - Don't worry. I hate this guy more than anyone on Earth.\\
165 - This jerk is going to finally get what he deserves.\\
166 - Craigy?\\
167 - Is that you back there?\\
168 - Hello, Dad.\\
169 - For God's sake, son, you have no upper body strength at all. I know girls that could get out of this hold.\\
170 - Get your foot off my neck so I can kill you.\\
171 - Craigy, do you have any idea how pathetic you look right now?\\
172 - Do you even care?\\
173 - Are you so wrapped up with being a useless piece of pudgethat you can't even see how embarrassed you're making me?\\
174 - Um, I think he needs to breathe.\\
175 - I'm going to let you up now. I want you to dust yourself off, suck in your gut, and introduce me to your friends.\\
176 - I'm not doing anything you tell me. I hate you.\\
177 - And I wasn't even choking. I was faking it.\\
178 - Vic Feldspar. Nice to meet you, boys.\\
179 - - I'm this one's father, I guess. - Father? Ha!\\
180 - You pretended not to know me at the father-son picnic.\\
181 - Sorry I wasn't swelling with pride while I watched you suck the butter off other people's corncobs.\\
182 - You wonder why I'm so messed up?\\
183 - It's because from the day I was born, I've heard nothing but four-count Burpees and constant, lisping criticism.\\
184 - Why don't you go back to San Diego and all your macho friends?\\
185 - - I'm not leaving until you seriously think about my offer. - I don't want your stupid gymnasiums.\\
186 - I told you.\\
187 - Craigy, the people in Chicago put in a very nice bid.\\
188 - I can't put them off anymore. This is your last chance.\\
189 - He wants to give you a string of gymnasiums?\\
190 - As long as he can get me back under his thumb.\\
191 - Actually, I'm giving them up either way. It's time for me to retire.\\
192 - I got a top of the line Fleetwood RV.\\
193 - I'm going to drag it across America with my teeth.\\
194 - Son, don't be an idiot. There is still a chance I can fix you.\\
195 - I don't care. I'm not going back with you.\\
196 - - I escaped, and I'm staying escaped. - Okay, you're obviously hysterical.\\
197 - I've got to start my 30-mile run. That gives you two hours and 16 minutes to calm down.\\
198 - Meet me at Applebee's, and we'll try to discuss this like grown-ups.\\
199 - I'll come, but it'll be for the great service and atmosphere, not for you!\\
200 - - Dad, what are you doing? - I am making a decision tree.\\
201 - It is a tool to help you make difficult decisions. First, I started out with two branches, one for pulling the plug, the other one for keeping him alive.\\
202 - Then I made branches from those branches for all the possible outcomes.\\
203 - I'm getting it all out of my head so I can see what I'm dealing with logically.\\
204 - "Pulling plug causes feeling of Godlike power. Forced to kill again"?\\
205 - Well, I'm trying to cover everything. But now I have gone through all the possibilities, and I really think I am zeroing in on a decision.\\
206 - All your outcomes on "pull the plug" assume that he dies right away.\\
207 - Yes, Dewey, that's what pulling the plug means.\\
208 - Not necessarily.\\
209 - He could continue to live without his respirator,\\
210 - his body wasting away while he struggles for breath like a fish on a dock gasping for air,\\
211 - slowly suffocating over the course of weeks or even months.\\
212 - - I read about this one... - Thank you, Dewey.\\
213 - Like I don't get enough of the know-it-all stuff from Malcolm.\\
214 - Here you go, Craig. I made your favorite; lemon meringue pie.\\
215 - I want to thank you people for your hospitality.\\
216 - Opening your house up to me and the living garbage disposal over here.\\
217 - It's our pleasure.\\
218 - I hope you like dinner. I wasn't sure whether to make a chicken or a ham.\\
219 - Chicken or ham, boy, that's a tough one. Chicken or ham.\\
220 - You're life must be a living hell.\\
221 - So, did Craig tell you how he got honorable mention for his community gardens?\\
222 - Sitting on his ass making food? Sounds about right.\\
223 - Hello.\\
224 - Oh, yes, Dr. Samson.\\
225 - Hal, you promised us a decision a week ago. The hospital needs this room for urgent care patients.\\
226 - Now, we have to either pull the plug on Mr. Edelman or move him to a private intensive care facility.\\
227 - - We have to have your decision now, right now. - Okay, listen, I'm going to need your help here.\\
228 - Just strictly from an emotionless, purely medical standpoint, what should I do?\\
229 - - Pull the plug. - Let him live.\\
230 - Damn it, Georgie, you know the chances for a coma patient waking up are practically zero.\\
231 - Practically zero does not mean zero. Why the hell do you give up so easily?\\
232 - He's shown no activity, no responsiveness, no eye movement for a month. It's over.\\
233 - You know as well as I that patients can be in a persistent vegetative state for years and still recover.\\
234 - We can argue about this all day. We're not going to get anywhere. It's up to you.\\
235 - Just put an "X" somewhere.\\
236 - What's wrong with him?\\
237 - The doctors called it "hysterical conversion disorder." It's psychosomatic. Apparently, he's paralyzed from the waist up.\\
238 - Waist up?\\
239 - Dad, what is it?\\
240 - I think he's thanking you.\\
241 - Dad, what are you doing here?\\
242 - I told you no at Applebee's, no at Malcolm's house,\\
243 - and no all the way home as you jogged alongside my car.\\
244 - I wanted to give you something.\\
245 - What is it?\\
246 - Used to call that your unk-unk.\\
247 - Your mother bought that for you the day she found out she was pregnant.\\
248 - The only day I saw her happier was the day you were born.\\
249 - Wow.\\
250 - I haven't been totally honest with you, son, but before I go, I owe you the truth.\\
251 - I never made it a secret how disappointed I am with the way you turned out.\\
252 - But what you don't know is if your mother was alive today, she's be just as disappointed.\\
253 - What?\\
254 - Opening those gyms wasn't just my dream, it was your mother's dream, too.\\
255 - Fitness was her life, and it was her dying wish for you to embrace a life of health and vitality.\\
256 - - Why didn't you ever tell me that? - Because I kept thinking if I pushed you enough,\\
257 - eventually you'd turn yourself around.\\
258 - But, apparently to you, I'm an annoyance, not an inspiration.\\
259 - - No, you're... - It doesn't really matter.\\
260 - Your mom's in heaven now, crying at the waste you made of your life.\\
261 - I know you don't want to run those gyms to please me,\\
262 - but you might want to consider doing it for your mother.\\
263 - Do those jumpsuits come in extra large?\\
264 - I waited all my life to hear those words.\\
265 - It's been four days, Hal. I've tried to be patient, but this has gone on long enough.\\
266 - You've got to snap out of it.\\
267 - Look, I'll admit you've been resourceful. You've learned to do so many things,\\
268 - and the sex has been interesting, but you can't go on living like this.\\
269 - Don't think I don't know what this is all about, Hal. You're trying to avoid making this decision.\\
270 - This is not going to work. And frankly, this whole thing is beneath you.\\
271 - It's a cowards way out, Hal.\\
272 - You think I wouldn't like a paralyzed vacation, everyone waiting on me hand and foot?\\
273 - But you know what? It doesn't work that way.\\
274 - You can't make up ridiculous illnesses just to get out of doing what you don't want to do.\\
275 - Oh, for God's sake, do you have any idea how insane you're acting?\\
276 - I'm just glad that your boys aren't here to see this.\\
277 - Oh, Hal, you changed Jamie's diapers with those feet.\\
278 - - Reese, how could you just leave him in there? - Every time I pulled him out, Jamie started crying.\\
279 - Okay, this is ending right now.\\
280 - You are going to stop being paralyzed and you are going to make this decision.\\
281 - I know you think you can't do this. I know you're worried you'll choose wrong, but Hal,\\
282 - you had a very hard choice to make in your life before and you made not only a good decision.\\
283 - You made a brilliant one...\\
284 - you decided to marry me.\\
285 - No one thought it was a good idea. All your friends thought you were making a horrible mistake.\\
286 - Your parents, my parents. They all said I was a pushy, opinionated loudmouth, but you knew I was perfect for you. And I am.\\
287 - It's the best decision anyone's ever made.\\
288 - Every day I wake up grateful or that brilliant, brilliant decision.\\
289 - And you can do it again, Hal. I know you can.\\
290 - But with you it was obvious.\\
291 - Even so, honey.\\
292 - You better say your good-byes quickly. We need to squeeze in a lake swim before we head to the airport.\\
293 - - But... - Ready? Begin.\\
294 - I'll miss you guys.\\
295 - Craig, you don't have to do this.\\
296 - Let's face it. I don't have any better options.\\
297 - It's your lunchtime.\\
298 - That's his lunch?\\
299 - Every day until he drops 90 pounds. These pills here are my own formula.\\
300 - It's got three times the RDA of the all you basic vitamins and nutrients.\\
301 - Sadly, it doesn't contain any character.\\
302 - See ya, Craig.\\
303 - I guess this means I don't owe you that 50 bucks anymore.\\
304 - I'll think of you every time I open a jar of mayonnaise.\\
305 - So, um, Vic, Craig's mom was a real fitness buff, huh?\\
306 - Absolutely. She did a triathlon the day after giving birth to Craig.\\
307 - There was no stopping that woman.\\
308 - Really? No stopping this woman?!\\
309 - Give that back!\\
310 - Mama?\\
311 - Oh, my God, she's beautiful. I thought you said all the photos of her were destroyed in the twister that killed her.\\
312 - What did you want me to say? That your mother ran out on me with a guy who owned a pie shop?\\
313 - That after years of slaving away to give that woman everything, she decided she wasn't attracted to me anymore? That I wasn't man enough for her?\\
314 - Come on, Craig. What would that have done to your self-esteem?\\
315 - - So, my mom is alive? - Oh, great. So, now this all going to be about her.\\
316 - How could you do this to me? How could you lie to me all these years?\\
317 - I did what I thought was best for you.\\
318 - No, you didn't. You did what you thought would punish her. All this time, you weren't yelling at me, but at this beautiful, beautiful woman.\\
319 - Dad, I'm not going with you.\\
320 - My life isn't a mess. I love my life. I love my job, I love my cat, I love my friends.\\
321 - I've made something of myself. I'm Desk Sergeant at my Neighborhood Watch.\\
322 - And a 14th-level elf cleric. I am not going to throw that away.\\
323 - You almost sounded like a man for a second.\\
324 - Good-bye, Dad.\\
325 - You actually have a pretty good grip there, son.\\
326 - It's my joystick hand.\\
327 - Hal, I am so proud of you for making such a great decision. And such a surprising one.\\
328 - I thought your only choices were life or death. Who would have thought there was a third option?\\
329 - People aren't willing to think outside the box. See, the answer was there all the time.\\
330 - Someone just had to see it. Once I found out he was a bird lover, well, it all made sense.\\
331 - - And everything was at Radio Shack? - Everything but the hat.\\
332 - You know what, Hal? Your solution was so brilliant, would you mind walking me through it one more time, step-by-step, just so I understand it completely?\\
333 - Honey, no, it was so exhausting. I don't think I'll talk about it ever again.\\
334 - Well, I suppose it's for the best.
\subsection {Episode 13: Tiki Lounge}
1 - Good dinner, honey.\\
2 - Thanks. I'm stunned I had time to cook anything.\\
3 - Traffic was horrible, and then on the way to the market I hit a possum.\\
4 - You're kidding.\\
5 - It was just awful. It laid there moaning and dying.\\
6 - I didn't know what to do. So I finally called Animal Services.\\
7 - I waited and waited, nobody ever came.\\
8 - I was so upset. I never did have time to get to the store.\\
9 - If you never made it to the store, then what are we eating?\\
10 - Something from the freezer.\\
11 - Finish it.\\
12 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.13 - Tiki Lounge\\
13 - Synchronisation par Mark & Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
14 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
15 - I'll pick up Dewey from his piano lesson. And you're waiting for the dry wall guy?\\
16 - Yeah, but you got to get the vacuum. I'll take the boys for their haircuts, and go pay the phone bill.\\
17 - All right. By the way, the dermatologist called. He said that the lump on my back is just...\\
18 - Don't put it out with more fire, moron!\\
19 - Oh, my God.\\
20 - I don't care if it's only a little poisonous. Get rid of it.\\
21 - So he said it was just an ingrown hair.\\
22 - What?\\
23 - The lump.\\
24 - Oh, good.\\
25 - That was 18 hours ago. That's the last time we talked to each other?\\
26 - Oh, my God.\\
27 - I mean, oh, my God.\\
28 - We talk to each other 20 seconds a day?!\\
29 - Don't worry, honey. This is a problem, but I will take care of it.\\
30 - For the next five days, you boys will be my slaves.\\
31 - It will be miserable, hard, exhausting work, but...\\
32 - Nope, that's it.\\
33 - Just miserable, hard work.\\
34 - So no matter what we have planned or how busy we are, you're okay with exploiting us for child labor?\\
35 - Good, we're clear. Let's get to work.\\
36 - Come to Papa.\\
37 - Dad?\\
38 - Oh, no, you don't, Reese. No way.\\
39 - You give the nail gun to Dewey.\\
40 - You wanted to see me, Mr. Herkabe?\\
41 - Malcolm, one of the many perks of working in the glamorous field of public education is the constant opportunity to suddenly increase your workload.\\
42 - It's as big a morale booster as the constant chiseling of gum from one's shoes...\\
43 - You know, you can come right out and tell me how you're screwing me over.\\
44 - You don't have to make a speech every time.\\
45 - Be patient.\\
46 - Yesterday I was informed that all faculty members must serve as advisors to at least one of the school's many clubs and organizations.\\
47 - I've been assigned the North High Boosters.\\
48 - And you're telling me because...?\\
49 - It's coming.\\
50 - The Boosters are only nine members, which makes it a group. We need ten for it to be a club. And if it isn't a club, I don't get my $200 advisor fee.\\
51 - You want me to join?\\
52 - I love it when a victim fully grasps the horror. You have proved a worthy patsy.\\
53 - I don't want to be in your stupid club.\\
54 - It's not a club until you joined keep up.\\
55 - Okay, what's the blackmail?\\
56 - Why must you rush these things?\\
57 - As Vice Principal, I write the college recommendations. I've written two for you.\\
58 - One has your complete academic record.\\
59 - The other has your complete academic record and a short paragraph about your personality.\\
60 - That's not fair!\\
61 - The meeting starts at 3:15 tomorrow. Come early if you want spirit cookies.\\
62 - Keep 'em closed. Almost there.\\
63 - Hal, you spun me around 50 times. I still know we're going to the garage.\\
64 - Okay, open 'em.\\
65 - Oh, Hal, it's... It's beautiful.\\
66 - Well, I didn't do it all myself. The boys worked their butts off.\\
67 - You know, that's a working wet bar.\\
68 - And a real New Zealand Mocking Mask.\\
69 - Congratulations, boys, you did a fantastic job.\\
70 - Now, if you set one foot in here, I will cripple you.\\
71 - What?\\
72 - From now on, every night from 6:00 to 7:00 is "tiki time."\\
73 - Tiki time means your mother and I will be in here, alone, with no questions, no interruptions, no communication from you boys of any kind.\\
74 - Malcolm, you'll cover any of your mom's shifts at Lucky Aide. Reese, Dewey, baby-sit Jamie.\\
75 - But...\\
76 - No buts.\\
77 - You're the ones who ruined our relationship in the first place.\\
78 - Hal...\\
79 - He needs changing.\\
80 - Aloha.\\
81 - I would like to officially welcome my young friend Malcolm to the North High Booster Club.\\
82 - It's a very rewarding day for all of us, who care so much about...\\
83 - Whatever it is you do.\\
84 - Phillip?\\
85 - First, let's review our Food for the Homeless program. Wayne?\\
86 - Good news, Boosters, we raised $428 at our rad "Bowling For Hobos" event.\\
87 - Unfortunately, the decorating budget got away from us. We spent $425 on the balloons.\\
88 - But I think we might be able to salvage this by taking that three dollars and buying the homeless a really nice card.\\
89 - Great idea.\\
90 - Good save, Wayne.\\
91 - All right, Stephanie, what about our pancake breakfast for the Abused Children's Counseling Center?\\
92 - It's gonna be awesome. We have tons of decorations and hundreds of balloons.\\
93 - Maybe if you eased up on the balloons, you'd have some more money for the counseling center.\\
94 - I don't think abused children want to eat some glumy undecorated room.\\
95 - I mean, after what they've been through, let's not abuse their sense of taste.\\
96 - - Yeah. - Absolutely.\\
97 - Let's move on to our Monte Carlo Night for the school library.\\
98 - This year we've invested in a professional Bingo caller. It's going to be insane.\\
99 - And Malcolm?\\
100 - What? I'm awake.\\
101 - Don't worry. We've saved a really important job just for you. You are going to be our Monte Carlo Night auctioneer.\\
102 - What?\\
103 - That's right. You're going to be in front of the whole school representing us.\\
104 - Welcome aboard, Booster.\\
105 - Point of order!\\
106 - Can we start Smile Patrol before the kids go home?\\
107 - Smile Patrol?\\
108 - We thought it'd be fun to roam the halls for anyone who's not smiling and give them a ticket.\\
109 - Meeting adjourned.\\
110 - I think someone's going to have to write themselves up.\\
111 - This is so unfair.\\
112 - Yeah, when I grow up, I'm going to do exactly the same thing to my kids.\\
113 - Yeah, mine are going to pay big time.\\
114 - By the time I came back, there were adult diapers all over the loading dock.\\
115 - That's wonderful.\\
116 - Oh, I hear a coconut that needs refreshing.\\
117 - One more Beach Frolic coming up.\\
118 - - So, go on. - I'm finished.\\
119 - That's my entire day.\\
120 - Mine, too.\\
121 - Huh, how about that? Do you realize that we have never told each other our entire day before?\\
122 - That's amazing.\\
123 - That's something else I've never told you.\\
124 - Think, Lois. I want to know everything.\\
125 - I had a pet turtle named Lee Majors.\\
126 - He gave my whole family salmonella.\\
127 - I thought I loved you four seconds ago.\\
128 - I want out of the Booster club.\\
129 - You can blackmail me all you want, but those kids are stupid, the auctioneer job is stupid, the whole thing blows and I'm quitting.\\
130 - Someone's putting the "boo" in booster.\\
131 - Did you see the crap they're trying to auction?\\
132 - 500 take-out menus from a Chinese restaurant, an AOL starter disc, scrapbook lessons, a 15-minute neck massage from Earl the janitor.\\
133 - Nobody wants that stuff. I'm out of there.\\
134 - Good for you. Go right ahead.\\
135 - What?\\
136 - I officially stopped caring at 2:15 when I was handed this check.\\
137 - And now I can finally splurge on new brake pads and treat my Civic like the lady that she is.\\
138 - You should really learn to trust me, Malcolm. It worked out well for everyone.\\
139 - I got my money, you get to quit, and the Boosters get to be rid of you.\\
140 - What are you talking about?\\
141 - They don't like you any more than you like them. They think you're too lazy and selfish to be Booster material.\\
142 - You're lying.\\
143 - - Oh, my God, you care. - No, I don't.\\
144 - They're a bunch of hypocrites pretending to be into charity just to have an excuse to throw parties and socialize and be surrounded by balloons.\\
145 - Is this going to devolve into you shamble in around the quite come next June desperate for someone to sign your yearbook?\\
146 - Calling me selfish and lazy?\\
147 - I could raise ten times the money those idiots ever could!\\
148 - Please. You're not seriously thinking of "showing them a thing or two," are you?\\
149 - Shut up!\\
150 - Jamie...\\
151 - Come on, just try it. It's easy.\\
152 - What are you doing?\\
153 - He's trying to teach Jamie to smoke.\\
154 - Since we're stuck watching him, I figured we might as well do something cool with him.\\
155 - What's cooler than a smoking baby?\\
156 - Why don't you just shoot him out of a cannon?\\
157 - Come on, he could be famous.\\
158 - You know, "Jamie, that smokin' baby." He could do talk shows or tour with rock bands.\\
159 - But he doesn't even care.\\
160 - Give him a break. He's not even two.\\
161 - I'm not mad that he won't light the cigarette. I'm mad that he won't try.\\
162 - I think he's stupid.\\
163 - Look, pal, we missed the chance to raise you inside a Sparklet's bottle.\\
164 - This is our last shot.\\
165 - We're not going to move. We're going to sit here for as long as it takes.\\
166 - Aw, man!\\
167 - You did that on purpose.\\
168 - You going to play it that way, fine. Now it's war.\\
169 - I miss the rotary phone, too.\\
170 - It made you slow down. Think about what you're gonna say.\\
171 - Yeah, exactly. Now it's bup-bup-bup and there they are whether you're ready or not.\\
172 - This is wonderful.\\
173 - Just think, when we get to heaven we'll feel like this all the time.\\
174 - Wouldn't that be nice?\\
175 - What do you mean?\\
176 - I mean, it would be nice, heaven.\\
177 - You mean it will be nice.\\
178 - I just don't personally... believe in that.\\
179 - Well, okay, maybe not the clouds and the harps and angels, but you do believe in some kind of heaven, right?\\
180 - Okay, so you don't believe in heaven, but you do believe in some kind of paradise where our two souls will go spend eternity.\\
181 - I'm just not much of an afterlife person.\\
182 - Wait a minute, Lois. Where are good people rewarded and bad people punished?\\
183 - Right here on Earth, if I have anything to say about it.\\
184 - How is it I didn't know about this until now?\\
185 - Well, I guess we just never had time to talk about it.\\
186 - - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah.\\
187 - It's silly to ruin tiki time over this.\\
188 - I will refresh our drinks.\\
189 - Oh, I can't do this! You've ruined it.\\
190 - Why?\\
191 - Because for the last 20 years I've assumed we'd be spending eternity together. And if you don't believe that, then you won't be there.\\
192 - Is that the rule?\\
193 - Nothing about this place is right anymore.\\
194 - It feels like that New Zealand Mocking Mask is... mocking me.\\
195 - Hal, I didn't say this to upset you.\\
196 - I know...\\
197 - Can we talk about it?\\
198 - I think we've talked enough.\\
199 - I'm going to go take kind of a long walk now.\\
200 - But you stay. Enjoy your rum-tumbler.\\
201 - Look at me play with this great toy, and I'm not gonna share it!\\
202 - Whee! This is fun!\\
203 - I'm not gonna turn around. Is he getting pissed?\\
204 - He's eating his foot.\\
205 - Nice cover.\\
206 - I'm getting to him.\\
207 - You're having a feud with a toddler.\\
208 - And you don't think he's playing that for all it's worth?\\
209 - Well, tiki time is over.\\
210 - You boys don't have to baby-sit anymore.\\
211 - And Monte Carlo Night is starting to shape up really nicely.\\
212 - We've got really cool-looking plastic champagne glasses, and we've also got six-channel walkie-talkies so we can be in constant audio contact in all sectors of the gymnasium.\\
213 - I also took it upon myself to raise the balloon budget.\\
214 - I figure if we're not going mylar, then why even bother?\\
215 - Okay, great, Victor.\\
216 - All right, and that brings us to the auction.\\
217 - It's gonna be horrible, but not because I'm not busting my butt.\\
218 - I've been hitting up people all around town, trying to get decent stuff that people will actually bid on, but no one's interested!\\
219 - Well, I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.\\
220 - Meeting adjourned.\\
221 - I can't believe that this is what happens when you actually try.\\
222 - Um, Good Night.\\
223 - - Why can't we just get past this? - I don't know.\\
224 - Why the hell did we think that talking to each other was a good idea?\\
225 - We were having fun and we got greedy. Now look at us.\\
226 - We used to have no time at all for each other, and it worked great.\\
227 - We should warn people. Write a book. Go on Oprah.\\
228 - - You know what would help? - What?\\
229 - If you changed your mind and told me that you believed in heaven.\\
230 - You want me to lie to you?\\
231 - It's not lying if what you say would be true if the facts were different.\\
232 - I'll work with whatever you give me. If you just say the words, you'll be giving me a tiny little gray area where I can live in peace for the rest of my life.\\
233 - I can live in gray, Lois. Let me live in gray!\\
234 - Hal, I'm sorry, I have to tell you the truth.\\
235 - Why?\\
236 - Because it's what I believe in.\\
237 - It's what I hang onto. The truth is all that I have.\\
238 - If I could give it up for anybody, I would give it up for you, but I just can't.\\
239 - Heaven's going to suck!\\
240 - We have to be home by 9:30. The baby-sitter said her halfway house goes into lockdown at 10:00.\\
241 - Did she tell you about the mobile over Jamie's crib?\\
242 - She said it looked like somebody took a saw and cut almost all tugh it.\\
243 - That's weird.\\
244 - It's not like he has any enemies or anything.\\
245 - Hey, Malcolm, the place looks great. Look at all these balloons.\\
246 - This is going to be a fun night.\\
247 - If watching your son be humiliated in front of the whole school is your idea of fun.\\
248 - What are you talking about?\\
249 - You're finally getting the attention you always wanted.\\
250 - Oh, come on, honey. I know you're upset. Let's try to have some fun tonight.\\
251 - Sure.\\
252 - If the here and now is all we've got, then let's enjoy it in all its beauty and wonder.\\
253 - I'll get us some churros.\\
254 - Hello, Malc.\\
255 - - Malc? - Forgive me, I'm feeling very odd tonight.\\
256 - What is it called when you look around and you are not filled with festering rage?\\
257 - - Being moderately happy? - That is it!\\
258 - I am moderately happy. I have brake pads, and enough left overfor a side mirror.\\
259 - And now I find that there's a wine tasting booth with an incredibly underpriced Riesling, just 25 cents a glass.\\
260 - So, if you'll excuse me, I think I saw a slightly drunk Ms. Bartlett headed for the ladies' room.\\
261 - I can't wait to see the look on Jamie's face tomorrow when he tries to tickle what's left of Elmo.\\
262 - Then he'll be sorry he started this.\\
263 - Stupid baby.\\
264 - Reese, let me ask you. When you end up in a situation like this, does it ever even occur to you to stop and figure out how you got there?\\
265 - And let him win?\\
266 - I mean, what do you do when your concept of eternity is wrapped up in a person that doesn't believe in eternity?\\
267 - I mean, does this eternity even exist?\\
268 - You might want to talk to a senior.\\
269 - That's it, Mr. Herkabe, you just broke the North High bank.\\
270 - Sometimes you're kissed by the gods.\\
271 - Your trip to the corndog cart has been comped.\\
272 - I should hope so.\\
273 - Ladies.\\
274 - I've been working hard, and I do care about this, but all your stuff blows.\\
275 - Don't worry, Malcolm. Just go up there and do your best.\\
276 - And don't be nervous. No one's expecting much.\\
277 - Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Monte Carlo Night auction.\\
278 - Please gather around.\\
279 - It's a wonderful night and a wonderful cause.\\
280 - I have to say that the members of the North High Boosters have really taught me so much about the true spirit of charity.\\
281 - So instead of the items listed in the program, we came up with some new items, which I think people will be very excited to bid on.\\
282 - First item up: Our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put up for auction, a photograph of herself from eighth grade...\\
283 - With her original nose!\\
284 - Ten dollars!\\
285 - - 20! 30! 40! 50! - 85 dollars!\\
286 - Sold!\\
287 - Next up: Wayne Finster, for the right price.\\
288 - Has volunteered to read out loud all the notes his mother puts in his lunch every day.\\
289 - Five dollars! Ten! 25! 58 dollars and 25 cents!\\
290 - Sold!\\
291 - Next item: Our club president, Phillip, has agreed to show the video his dad took of him crying after he got pulled from the Madison football game.\\
292 - - 50 dollars! 60! 70! 80! - Sold!\\
293 - Over 200 dollars in 30 seconds. I think we've shown what the Booster spirit is really all about.\\
294 - That is so much money!\\
295 - We're raising so much money!\\
296 - For an extra 50 dollars, I'll throw in a picture of me from before fat camp!\\
297 - - In a bikini! - 50 dollars! 60!\\
298 - - I also have notes from my shrink! - 80 bucks! 90!\\
299 - - And my dad taped me singing "Skater Boy" into a hairbrush! - 75 bucks! 80! 90!\\
300 - Our next item up for bid...\\
301 - is me.\\
302 - I will let the top bidder cover my mouth with duct tape every morning for a week.\\
303 - 90! 100! 120! 130! 160! 170! 180! 200! 210! 240! 250!\\
304 - Well, that was quite an auction.\\
305 - Yeah. This was one of the best nights of my life.\\
306 - And I actually did something about myself.\\
307 - I was having this giant conflict about my principles, but it was really just about my own pride.\\
308 - And all I had to do to fix it is get over myself.\\
309 - Excuse me.\\
310 - Hal?\\
311 - I've changed my mind. I do believe in heaven.\\
312 - I knew it!\\
313 - Oh, I always knew you believed in heaven.\\
314 - Keep the whistle. I'm good.\\
315 - Jamie, we need to talk.\\
316 - I'm calling a truce. I know you're willing to keep going it gets, and I respect that.\\
317 - But I realized something. Malcolm and Dewey are both geniuses, so they're gonna team up against us.\\
318 - And since you and I are both mentally the same, we should team up, too.\\
319 - Otherwise, they're gonna do something horrible to us, and we probably won't even  understand it.\\
320 - So...\\
321 - here.\\
322 - Hey, thanks.\\
323 - Reese, what the hell is wrong with you?!\\
324 - What?

5 - Grandma's visiting again. Sometimes she can't spread enough misery with just a phone call.\\
6 - She must have felt a vibration of happiness at the edge of her web and came scurrying down just to crush it.\\
7 - The worst thing is how it affects Mom.\\
8 - Mom, I took 20 bucks from your purse. I'm never going to pay it back.\\
9 - I don't care who started it, you and your brother work it out.\\
10 - See? It's sad.\\
11 - Oh!\\
12 - Lois, I keep finding your mother's teeth everywhere.\\
13 - Is she spitting them out or are they escaping?\\
14 - She must be wearing her smoking teeth. Those are her fancy teeth.\\
15 - Look, I can't fight every battle with her, Hal. I got her to smoke outside. That's today's victory.\\
16 - Now that I have a car, I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.\\
17 - No, Dewey, please don't go. We didn't know it was the baby's thermometer.\\
18 - It's too late for apologies. I'm out of here.\\
19 - Dewey, just name your price. We'll do anything.\\
20 - You think this is about money? This is about respect...\\
21 - Oh, crap.\\
22 - Dad, chili for breakfast?\\
23 - Hey, Jamie ate two bowls and you don't hear him complaining.\\
24 - Why isn't Mom back from Grandma's yet?\\
25 - For God's sakes, Reese, your grandmother lost a leg.\\
26 - Show a little compassion for your mother who's stuck there taking care of that miserable hag.\\
27 - She'll be back when she gets back.\\
28 - And don't take this out on me. I'm not the one who walked into the street.\\
29 - But no one's blaming you for this, Dewey.\\
30 - Dad, I already feel awful about it.\\
31 - Which is exactly what I'm telling you not to do. You need to stay positive.\\
32 - Think about how good you'll feel next time when you remember to look both ways.\\
33 - Shouldn't you boys be getting ready for school?\\
34 - Didn't you hear?\\
35 - They went to four-hour days. It's shameful.\\
36 - - The taxpayers won't even support... - Forget it, Reese.\\
37 - You are not going to misbehave this week. Your mother already thinks I can't be trusted to watch you boys.\\
38 - Like somehow I'm going to do something idiotic and irresponsible.\\
39 - Hey, look at this. Some kid fell asleep at a frat party and another kid glued his face to the floor.\\
40 - Can you imagine what that looked like?\\
41 - Just regular old Super Glue. We've got a ton of that stuff in our garage.\\
42 - Where do people get these ideas?\\
43 - Mother, I was getting the door for you.\\
44 - I don't need your pity! I'm fine!\\
45 - No, you are not fine. You need to relax.\\
46 - If you keep thrashing around, the doctor says it'll make your leg bleed again.\\
47 - Ha! Scare tactics those butchers tell you so you'll get weak and they can sell you more go-go pills.\\
48 - There... and there.\\
49 - I helped get her moved back in and I spent some time in her place. My obligation is fulfilled.\\
50 - Have fun you two.\\
51 - Get back in here. We are not having this argument again.\\
52 - Let him go. It's the little one that owes me his life.\\
53 - See, even she thinks so.\\
54 - Francis, everyone elsen in this family has either school or a job. So you're staying here and helping your grandmother.\\
55 - I don't need help.\\
56 - Look at him. He has nothing between his legs and he manages.\\
57 - - If you think I'm above punching you, you are totally wrong. - Of course you'd hit a cripple.\\
58 - You couldn't even get a white girl to marry you.\\
59 - Stop it both of you.\\
60 - Can you go at least five seconds without screaming at each other?\\
61 - - I am sick of you! - You stupid Nancy boy!\\
62 - - You dried up old hag! If I had been driving that truck myself... - You ought to strangle yourself...\\
63 - Well, I wonder which nightmare I'm going to have tonight.\\
64 - "The Forest of Severed Legs" or "Drowning in Grandma's Blood"?\\
65 - Well, good night.\\
66 - I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.\\
67 - Me, too.\\
68 - Nothing's going to wake me up.\\
69 - Same here.\\
70 - Well... good night.\\
71 - Good night.\\
72 - What's under your pillow?\\
73 - What's under your pillow?\\
74 - I think we both know what's under these pillows.\\
75 - I guess we do.\\
76 - - Good morning. - Good morning.\\
77 - I feel great. Ready to start the day.\\
78 - Me, too.\\
79 - - Think I'll brush my teeth. - I'll join you.\\
80 - Jamie, I am not kidding. You have to the count of three to eat these peas.\\
81 - One...\\
82 - Two...\\
83 - Three!\\
84 - All right. But one of these days you are going to learn that I am serious.\\
85 - Dad, I've been thinking a lot about Grandma losing her leg.\\
86 - I mean, Grandma lost her leg saving my life, but she doesn't really want to talk to me, so I figure the least I can do is honor her leg.\\
87 - You know, pay it some decent last respects. Like maybe have a funeral for it or something.\\
88 - Dewey, you just can't do that. The leg is medical waste.\\
89 - The hospital has to process it and do whatever they do with that stuff.\\
90 - How about this?\\
91 - Tomorrow, we go in the garage and make your grandmother a peg. You can paint it like a candy cane.\\
92 - No, I want the leg.\\
93 - You can't get a leg, Dewey. That's just not going to happen.\\
94 - Hello, Pathology?\\
95 - Yes, this is Judy Green from Dr. Weiss' office.\\
96 - I'm calling about the chop-and-drop he did Thursday on the old lady.\\
97 - Listen, Dr. Weiss thinks he may have left his wedding ring in that leg. He was pretty hammered.\\
98 - Yeah, again.\\
99 - So anyway, we need to get that leg out of there before the lawyers come around and do their Monday-morning quarterbacking.\\
100 - You know what, instead of the usual place, just send it to my house. I'll give you the address.\\
101 - I don't care if you knew the end of that Star Trek episode! I didn't and you ruined it!\\
102 - - You can't let anyone else be happy! - Shut up, monkey!\\
103 - Anyone with half a brain could see the rocks were alive!\\
104 - Both of you, stop it!\\
105 - Francis, it does not matter how horribly you act, you are not getting out of this!\\
106 - You are stuck here, so suck it up!\\
107 - And you... you are old and injured and you need his help. All your yelling and viciousness does not equal physical strength.\\
108 - You cannot bully a can of soup down off the shelf. You cannot scream it down. You need his help.\\
109 - Yeah, you old bat, where's your gratitude?\\
110 - Francis...\\
111 - I am not asking you to do this for her, I'm asking you to do this for me.\\
112 - I am leaving in a few days and I need to know she's being taken care of.\\
113 - You have to find some way you can get along with her.\\
114 - But she's horrible.\\
115 - I know, I know, but just try.\\
116 - Find something you have in common, something you can agree on.\\
117 - I don't think that's possible.\\
118 - For God sakes, you both have such huge reservoirs of hate, you're telling me there's no overlap?\\
119 - What about boy bands?\\
120 - Mom, you hate boy bands, right?\\
121 - They're making a living, give them a break.\\
122 - You see?\\
123 - You're not getting out of this so easily. You stay here and you figure it out right now.\\
124 - Hey, Ida, don't you hate how bossy my mom is?\\
125 - Oh God, she's awful. Always ordering me around, making me jump through hoops for her like every day is her birthday.\\
126 - And God forbid you forget her birthday. Then it's martyr time for the next five weeks.\\
127 - And for what? Everyone knows it's a made-up holiday anyway.\\
128 - And those stupid cards? Money in the garbage.\\
129 - Oh, God yes! What a scam. It's like, "La-la, I'm old, so here's a stupid cartoon with boobs on it."\\
130 - Exactly.\\
131 - No one really remembers the day they had their child. They pretend they do to feel important.\\
132 - I haven't slept in two days.\\
133 - I cut school just to have some time in the house without Reese.\\
134 - I just need an hour. A half hour.\\
135 - Any sleep at all, then I'll have a jump on him. You can't win this on strength. You've got to win it on planning.\\
136 - You saved yourself this time.\\
137 - But your reactions will get slower.\\
138 - And I'll be waiting.\\
139 - Wait! Reese, wait! This is so stupid.\\
140 - We're both ruining our lives over it.\\
141 - I got a "B" on my History midterm.\\
142 - I fell asleep beating up a kid.\\
143 - - We have to stop this. - I totally agree.\\
144 - Okay.\\
145 - Truce?\\
146 - Truce.\\
147 - She wears a size 8  shoe just like me. Why, Dewey?\\
148 - Just checking. Thanks, Mom.\\
149 - Okay. Prince Charming looking for Cinderella.\\
150 - That's all it is.\\
151 - - Grandma, hold still. I can't re-dress your wound until I clean it. - Your breath is disgusting.\\
152 - Do you see what I'm doing, and you're complaining about ?\\
153 - I will go brush my teeth as soon as I'm done.\\
154 - We are gathered here today to pay tribute to...\\
155 - a leg.\\
156 - A leg that saved me.\\
157 - But also kicked me, and stomped on my toes a lot. But that wasn't your idea.\\
158 - Anyway, uh...\\
159 - I'm sorry. I just thought once I had the hole and the severed leg in front of me the words would come naturally.\\
160 - Dad, what are you doing home?\\
161 - Dewey, I know you need your time alone, but I did something I think is gonna make you feel a lot better.\\
162 - Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.\\
163 - I kept thinking, "There must be some way I can help take little Dewey's mind off all this".\\
164 - "There must be some way I can put the fun back in his life."\\
165 - Of course, your mom is probably going to hit the roof when she finds out, but you just let me handle that, huh?\\
166 - Dad, what are you talking about?\\
167 - I'm talking about a lovable furry playmate who you can spend years with, frolicking and... Oh, my God!\\
168 - - What the hell is he eating? - What is who eating?\\
169 - Your dog!\\
170 - You have him for two seconds and this is what happens?!\\
171 - I didn't ask for a dog!\\
172 - - Who brings a dog to a leg funeral?! - A leg funeral?!\\
173 - - Dewey, after I said ? - You didn't say not to,\\
174 - you just said I wouldn't be able to!\\
175 - This is me with your Uncle Vlad.\\
176 - This is the only picture of him sober.\\
177 - And there's Cousin Rega.\\
178 - You smile at her, she jumps into bed with you.\\
179 - And what's wrong with this person? What was his moral failing?\\
180 - My dear old friend, Peter.\\
181 - Look at him, holding a menu like he could read.\\
182 - - Wait, who's that little girl with you and Grandpa? - Oh, Mom, don't you want to watch the news?\\
183 - Who's that little girl? That's you, you big sissy!\\
184 - This was the time your mother sent you to live with us.\\
185 - What?\\
186 - Come on. It wasn't "to live" with you.\\
187 - It was six months. It felt like forever.\\
188 - We put you in a dress because you wouldn't pee like a boy.\\
189 - I don't remember any of this!\\
190 - And you never paid me for the food he ate. Oh, God, what whining; "I want my Mommy.\\
191 - Where's my family, Ooh, you're scaring me!" Blah, blah, blah.\\
192 - What's going on?\\
193 - Francis, it was a very difficult time. Your father was changing jobs, and then Reese came along. He was like a whole pack of wolves by himself. It was just too much.\\
194 - You were a horrible child. You tore a huge gash in your side trying to get out through the window.\\
195 - - That's what this is from? - You cried like a baby when I tried to sew you up.\\
196 - I was a baby!\\
197 - You dumped me off and you left me with this monster?!\\
198 - - Francis, it's not the way you're thinking. You don't even remember it. - No, but you know what? It's good to know.\\
199 - It's really nice to know that as a toddler, your own mother couldn't wait to get rid of you.\\
200 - - Francis... - Actually, I should thank you.\\
201 - 'Cause you waited till I was 15 before you kicked me out for good. That must have been so hard for you.\\
202 - You can't judge me for this. You weren't there.\\
203 -  And whose fault was that?!\\
204 - How did you get in here? Nobody liked looking at you when you were alive.\\
205 - Okay... what's going on?\\
206 - Look, I got into this thing with Reese and it's way out of hand.\\
207 - I haven't slept in three days. If you could just do me a favor, just be on lookout for Reese. If I can get one hour of sleep, then I can have the upper hand and I can end this.\\
208 - - Okay. - Thank you.\\
209 - Wait a minute. Why'd you say okay?\\
210 - - What? - I mean, I just told you and you said okay like it wasn't a big deal.\\
211 - It seems like you'd at least want to think about it for a little bit.\\
212 - Unless this was a setup. That's what this is, isn't it?\\
213 - -What's going on in here? What are you guys up to? -Oh, nice cover. You two have a side deal!\\
214 - No!\\
215 - Or maybe you're just trying to make me think we have a side deal.\\
216 - - Why would I do that? - Exactly!\\
217 - Don't try to make me think that you're confused, because I know you aren't.\\
218 - - Why would I want you to think that?! - Because...\\
219 - There's some angle that I'm not seeing, but I'll get it.\\
220 - - Nice bluff! - Nice fake-out!\\
221 - Oh, yeah? Well, you can play all the smart games you want, but I'm not gonna let you get away with it.\\
222 - I'll glue my own face to the floor! Then what are you gonna do, huh?\\
223 - That'd be the perfect way to make me let my guard down, wouldn't it?!\\
224 - Stevie,\\
225 - I know you'll be mature enough,\\
226 - not to do anything,\\
227 - I would do...\\
228 - Come on, Champion. Come on, boy. You don't want that nasty old leg, do you?\\
229 - - Okay, just kidding. Sorry. - Dad, he's ruining it!\\
230 - - Throw another steak in there. - I am not going to waste another steak.\\
231 - He's not going for it, and it was $12 a pound.\\
232 - It was not! It was bargain meat, and he knows the difference.\\
233 - I am doing my best here, son.\\
234 - Oh, boy.\\
235 - He's gonna finish the whole thing!\\
236 - - Call 911! - Dewey, what part of thislooks like authorities should be involved?\\
237 - God, if only your grandmother wasn't so damned tasty.\\
238 - Now there's no way to feel better.\\
239 - Now I have to feel bad forever.\\
240 - Oh, Dewey.\\
241 - Maybe you can try and think about it this way.\\
242 - Your grandmother...\\
243 - She is the most horrible woman who ever lived, but even she understands the difference between a life that's been lived and a life with potential.\\
244 - You want to pay her back?\\
245 - Live up to that potential.\\
246 - And if you think about it, you might have done her a big favor.\\
247 - Let's face it. Saving your life is her only chance of getting into heaven.\\
248 - Which isn't going to make you that popular in heaven, but we'll deal with that later.\\
249 - Okay.\\
250 - Hey, Dad?\\
251 - Is it okay if we don't keep the dog?\\
252 - Yeah, that sounds fair.\\
253 - - Grandma, you have to sit still or I can't get the bandage on. - Just keep your eyes on the stump, Romeo.\\
254 - Well,\\
255 - okay...\\
256 - I put all the doctors' numbers on the fridge.\\
257 - The safety rail is up in the shower.\\
258 - Thank you, Francis.\\
259 - - I have to tell you something. - What?\\
260 - I wasn't a good enough mother to you and I'm sorry.\\
261 - I shouldn't have left you with her,\\
262 - and I shouldn't have sent you to military school.\\
263 - I got overwhelmed and I took things out on you that weren't your fault. They were my fault, and I'm sorry.\\
264 - But?\\
265 - But nothing. I'd like to think I was a little bit better with the other boys, but that's just further proof that you got a terrible deal.\\
266 - Yes, boo-hoo for the boy with two legs.\\
267 - You deserved a mother who was more patient and more caring,\\
268 - and it breaks my heart that you didn't get that mother.\\
269 - Thank you. Wow.\\
270 - Wow.\\
271 - Wow.\\
272 - I've just waited so many years to hear you say that.\\
273 - Why don't I feel better?\\
274 - What do you mean?\\
275 - I mean, I actually had fantasies where you said that, pretty much word-for-word. It's spooky how close it is, but it's not helping.\\
276 - Why didn't it help?!\\
277 - - You want me to say something else? - No, no, I mean, you said everything! Anything else would just be fake.\\
278 - I mean, that was like the perfect thing, and I am still filled with all this resentment.\\
279 - Oh, my God, this sucks! That was, like, the one thing I was living for and it's just... not working at all!\\
280 - - Can you take the soap opera outside? I want to watch the whore that gives the weather. - Mother, please!\\
281 - - Just try to breathe. - No! You can't just have your life dream stripped away from you and be okay about it!\\
282 - - Do you want a cold washcloth? - I don't think so.\\
283 - - I don't know. I don't know what I want. - Do you want me to give you some money?\\
284 - How much money?\\
285 - I have $200. I only need $30 for the bus.\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - Here.\\
288 - And the Tic Tacs.\\
289 - Okay, honey, just remember that I love you.\\
290 - - In my own imperfect, bad mothering way, I do love you. - I love you, too.\\
291 - I'll call you.\\
292 - Okay, Rockefeller, it's lotion time. Cut your nails.\\
293 - Jennifer, cut it out!\\
294 - You're so bad.\\
295 - Your breath smells like feet.

12 - I'm sorry I'm late.\\
13 - My alarm clock didn't go off and then there was an accident and and road workers and...\\
14 - Where is everybody?\\
15 - Well, it's Ditch Day. None of the students came in.\\
16 - No one told me there was a ditch day.\\
17 - Well, I'm surprised you didn't hear. I mean, everyone was telling their friends.\\
18 - Oh...\\
19 - All right, Charisse, the professor of boozology has some homework for you.\\
20 - What's he doing here?\\
21 - No one told him.\\
22 - Oh, my God.\\
23 - - You could probably use a little... - Val, stop that.\\
24 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\\
25 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\\
26 - What?\\
27 - You are going to die!\\
28 - What is it?\\
29 - I know I always say that gossip rots your soul, but it doesn't count when it's this good.\\
30 - Last night, I covered for Bernice so she could leave early,\\
31 - and when she got home, she found Charlie standing in their living room wearing her red cocktail dress!\\
32 - The one from the Christmas party with all the feathers!\\
33 - Good God!\\
34 - He admitted it's been going on for years.\\
35 - He said it started one day when he accidentally used lipstick instead of Chap Stick.\\
36 - The next thing you knew, he was wearing a teddy under his police uniform.\\
37 - Man is a complicated beast.\\
38 - Can you imagine keeping something like that from your spouse?\\
39 - So glad we don't have any secrets.\\
40 - What is it?\\
41 - Oh, honey, there's something I should confess to you.\\
42 - What?!\\
43 - I...\\
44 - I spent more than $50 on your last birthday present. I know we agreed not to, but I just love you so much.\\
45 - Well, I'm glad you told me.\\
46 - It felt good to come clean.\\
47 - Dad, can I have a sleepover tomorrow?\\
48 - Somebody wants to sleep over? Here?\\
49 - That's fantastic!\\
50 - Who?\\
51 - Chad from my class.\\
52 - Oh, geez, Dewey, I don't think that's a good idea. That kid is really...\\
53 - He's fine.\\
54 - He's just a little strange.\\
55 - Nothing to be scared of.\\
56 - Well, it's not anything to be taken lightly, either.\\
57 - That boy has a lot of serious issues. I don't think you know what you're getting into.\\
58 - Yes, I do.\\
59 - I also know people treat him like a freak for no reason.\\
60 - Even his parents have given up on him.\\
61 - They're just looking for an excuse to have him institutionalized.\\
62 - This is supposed to be convincing me?\\
63 - Dad, I want to prove that he can do normal stuff like a normal kid and have a normal life.\\
64 - No means no, Dewey.\\
65 - No doesn't always mean no.\\
66 - This isn't "PG-movie" no, this is "speargun" no.\\
67 - Dad, listen.\\
68 - I never ask for anything,\\
69 - but I'm asking you to do this for me.\\
70 - It's important.\\
71 - I'm sorry, Dewey, but I know a little bit more about this than you do.\\
72 - And you ask for things all the time.\\
73 - So where'd you go today?\\
74 - Oh, man, it was fantastic.\\
75 - Went down o the pet store,\\
76 - fed a bunch of the pets to the other pets,\\
77 - ended up at the supermarket, where I squeezed all the Wonder Bread into balls till the manager threw me out.\\
78 - I left a little present in his convertible.\\
79 - Well, it was somebody's convertible.\\
80 - You couldn't have bothered to tell me about Ditch Day?\\
81 - There was a ditch day?!\\
82 - Yeah, today.\\
83 - No one told me.\\
84 - Why didn't they tell me?\\
85 - Because no one likes us, Reese.\\
86 - No one.\\
87 - Everybody else was told about it.\\
88 - Even that slow kid who ate cat litter for a dollar.\\
89 - Ducky?\\
90 - How did Ducky get so popular?\\
91 - It's not that he's popular,\\
92 - it's that we're unpopular.\\
93 - Oh, my God.\\
94 - I'm as unpopular as you.\\
95 - Guess who's getting a treat?\\
96 - That's right, it's you, Mr. Boy.\\
97 - In this house, whenever anybody is good for three whole days in a row, they get one of Mama's extra special fruit smoothies.\\
98 - I have never made one before.\\
99 - Oh, this is outrageous!\\
100 - What's the matter?\\
101 - The blender is broken. There's no excuse for this!\\
102 - Honey, we have had it since before Dewey was born.\\
103 - I don't care. They said a lifetime guarantee.\\
104 - A lifetime is not ten or eleven years.\\
105 - Hal, if they want to say a ten or eleven-year guarantee, that's fine.\\
106 - I'll make my blender-buying decisions accordingly, but they said "lifetime."\\
107 - I'm getting my money back or a blender of equal or greater value.\\
108 - How are you going to find the warranty from ten years ago?\\
109 - I'm sure it's with the rest of the papers in the garage.\\
110 - Honey, you'll never find it out there. What did this cost, $19?\\
111 - That's what they want you to say!\\
112 - That's why they don't charge more! That's how they get you!\\
113 - You expecting somebody?\\
114 - Uh, yeah, it's Chad. He's sleeping over tonight.\\
115 - Dewey's having a sleepover?\\
116 - Yeah, we didn't have any plans. I thought it would be nice.\\
117 - Dewey, your friend's here!\\
118 - Hold on.\\
119 - I told you no, and you went behind my back and tricked your mother into letting you have this sleepover?\\
120 - I just told her it'd be a nice thing to do for a kid who doesn't have many nice things in his life.\\
121 - If you call that a trick, then yeah.\\
122 - You don't have to freak out. I know how to handle Chad.\\
123 - You can't believe everything you read in the special needs bulletin.\\
124 - They only say that stuff to get extra funding.\\
125 - That is not the point!\\
126 - Dewey, I made myself very clear. I told you no,\\
127 - and you snuck around my back to you mother as if nothing I said had any impact...\\
128 - Hello, there!\\
129 - You must be Chad's parents.\\
130 - - Yes. I'm Lloyd. - Lloyd.\\
131 - - And this is Evelyn. - Evelyn.\\
132 - And this...\\
133 - - God, where did he go?! - I watched him from the car to the door.\\
134 - Do I have to do everything?!\\
135 - Excuse me.\\
136 - Thank you for inviting me.\\
137 - Hi, Chad.\\
138 - Hey, Dewey.\\
139 - We want to thank you for doing this.\\
140 - I think it's wonderful the boys are getting together.\\
141 - Big books go on the bottom shelf.\\
142 - What did we tell you about touching their things?!\\
143 - Are you trying to prove that you can't go out in public?!\\
144 - This is your last chance, do you understand me, buddy?!\\
145 - - This is your last chance! - Lloyd, do something!\\
146 - You do something! The gene was on your egg.\\
147 - Oh, yeah, it's completely my fault. Now can we go to dinner?\\
148 - At bedtime,\\
149 - these straps are for his arms,\\
150 - and these are for his legs.\\
151 - If you wind up needing to use the harness, make sure he doesn't take a big breath in when you're fastening the buckles,\\
152 - otherwise, he can wriggle out and the whole thing is useless.\\
153 - Completely useless.\\
154 - Say good-bye to your parents, Chad.\\
155 - Good-bye.\\
156 - Here's a list of emergency numbers.\\
157 - Don't try 911.\\
158 - They're not qualified.\\
159 - Maybe they meant to tell us.\\
160 - They just forgot.\\
161 - They didn't forget.\\
162 - How could the whole school snub us like this?\\
163 - Don't they realize how much this hurts?\\
164 - They don't care.\\
165 - There are people in this world that are just plain evil.\\
166 - And every single person at that school is one of those people.\\
167 - No,\\
168 - we can't do this.\\
169 - We can't keep blaming everybody else whenever something like this happens.\\
170 - It can't be an accident that you and I alienate so many people.\\
171 - We're never going to make our lives better if we keep pretending they are the problem.\\
172 - Then what do we do?\\
173 - Well,\\
174 - I mean, if we really want to figure this out,\\
175 - maybe we need to look at ourselves honestly.\\
176 - You're right.\\
177 - What's wrong with us?\\
178 - Well, some parts are easy.\\
179 - - I mean, you're a ruthlessly brutal thug. - I have my moods.\\
180 - And look how it was my first impulse to criticize you.\\
181 - It just shows what a pompous ass I am.\\
182 - I do seem to cause a lot of needless suffering.\\
183 - I usually assume that people are my enemy.\\
184 - I have this need to show off.\\
185 - It's not enough that I know more than everyone.\\
186 - I have to make sure they know I know more.\\
187 - Why do I do that?\\
188 - Don't ask me. I know less than everyone.\\
189 - When I walk into a room, it seems like everybody's talking about things that I could never understand.\\
190 - And when they laugh, I'm always sure that they're laughing at me.\\
191 - Maybe we're both afraid.\\
192 - We're afraid people won't like us.\\
193 - That's why I show off how smart I am and that's why you hit people.\\
194 - We're scared of being rejected,\\
195 - so we act in a way that pushes people away.\\
196 - Oh, man.\\
197 - It's the thing that we hate the most, and yet we keep making it happen again and again.\\
198 - We're so stupid and pathetic.\\
199 - Or they're jealous!\\
200 - Yeah, totally jealous.\\
201 - I mean, they see us, and they don't want to face that they're all jealous,\\
202 - so they make us act all angry and superior!\\
203 - They're in denial.\\
204 - I am really glad we did this.\\
205 - Rough can't go next to smooth.\\
206 - This is exactly what I talked about, Dewey.\\
207 - He's gone through practically everything in the house.\\
208 - He taped my ties to my shirts.\\
209 - So the house gets straightened up.\\
210 - - Wouldn't that be horrible? - Don't you trivialize this. You're in enough trouble already.\\
211 - I'm telling you, once he settles down, this is going to be a perfectly normal sleepover.\\
212 - - We're going to play a board game, we're going to watch a video, we're going to have pizza... - No pizza. I'm already defrosting hamburgers.\\
213 - But I promised Chad pizza. He really likes pizza.\\
214 - No pizza, Dewey. You are on thin ice as it is.\\
215 - From now on, you are going to do exactly as I say. Is that understood?\\
216 - Yes, Dad, I got it. Now can I go play with my friend?\\
217 - Where'd he go?\\
218 - You'll see a lot of this in life, Jamie. The big blender company's don't think we're smart enough to save warranties.\\
219 - They think we run around barefoot all day picking bugs off ourselves. Well, they are in for a big surprise.\\
220 - They design their products specifically to break down three days after the warranties get lost.\\
221 - It's called "planned obsolescence,"\\
222 - like that deathtrap of a highchair you keep falling over in.\\
223 - I'm their worst nightmare, Jamie; a woman who saves everything.\\
224 - And I'm going to go through every shred of it.\\
225 - What's that, Mr. Big-Blender-Company man?\\
226 - You say I'm going to need paperwork?\\
227 - Oh, gee,\\
228 - I don't know if I have it. Oh, wait, I do.\\
229 - Dewey, I told you to keep Chad away from my desk.\\
230 - I just heard a whole bunch of kids from our school are going to stay overnight at that old abandoned house on Spires Road.\\
231 - No one told me.\\
232 - Big shock.\\
233 - I say we go there tonight and scare the crap out of them.\\
234 - - We're going to scare them for being jealous of us? - No, we're going to scare them for being jerks.\\
235 - All right, yeah. Let's do it.\\
236 - They think they can be jerks to us?\\
237 - We'll show them what jerks are.\\
238 - - Hi. I got a half cheese, half pepperoni. - What?\\
239 - - That little... - Listen, I'm kind of in a hurry. It's $12.\\
240 - - Just hold on a second. - Dewey!\\
241 - You get your butt in here right now, Mister!\\
242 - Dad, what is wrong with you? You can't go screaming in the house when Chad's here.\\
243 - I am the parent in this house, and you do what I say!\\
244 - Now when I tell you there is no pizza in this house,\\
245 - there's no pizza! That is the law!\\
246 - Dad... Don't you "Dad" me. You already "Dad-ed" me good with this sleepover.\\
247 - You know what?\\
248 - Sometimes if you're just being bigoted and unreasonable, maybe I don't have to listen to you.\\
249 - You better listen to me.\\
250 - - I am your father and you will respect... - Hey, you know what? This was supposed to go to 12336.\\
251 - I bet you feel like a jackass.\\
252 - I have something to tell you.\\
253 - Hal, it will have to wait.\\
254 - I wasted a half an hour getting Jamie to sleep.\\
255 - He kept crying because I wouldn't let him have the antifreeze bottle in bed with him.\\
256 - Lois, this is important.\\
257 - I was trying to spare you the embarrassment, but you should probably know.\\
258 - Dewey actually asked me first about the sleepover. And he went to you when I said no.\\
259 - Oh, sorry.\\
260 - What do you mean, "sorry"?\\
261 - Maybe you don't understand. He went around my back to get to you.\\
262 - And this is a big upset for you?\\
263 - For God's sake, Hal, they go behind my back to get to you all the time.\\
264 - That is very different. You are the hard ass.\\
265 - I'm the nice, fair one. Dewey knows that.\\
266 - Why would he betray me?\\
267 - Hal, I cannot get worked up about this right now.\\
268 - I have to find that warranty or the blender company wins.\\
269 - Is that what you want, Hal?\\
270 - Are you on their side?\\
271 - Fine. I'll help you.\\
272 - No, Hal. I have a system.\\
273 - Anyway, it seems to be going fine.\\
274 - I haven't heard a peep out of them in hours.\\
275 - Hey, Chad, I can teach you to play Chinese checkers if you want.\\
276 - Chad!\\
277 - White on white...\\
278 - Blue on blue...\\
279 - And yellow on yellow.\\
280 - Chad, don't do this.\\
281 - If someone catches you you'll be in big trouble...\\
282 - Dewey.\\
283 - Just a minute.\\
284 - Hello.\\
285 - Oh, hello, Lloyd.\\
286 - No, everything's going fine with Chad.\\
287 - Well, you can bring it if you think he needs it.\\
288 - We are going to scare the crap out of them.\\
289 - You know what?\\
290 - I don't feel sorry for them. They've got it coming.\\
291 - They deserve every stained pair of underwear they're about to get.\\
292 - Hey, is my eye socket oozing enough?\\
293 - It's perfect.\\
294 - Okay, on the count of three we bust through the door. If one of them has a heart attack, you resuscitate them and I'll scare them again.\\
295 - Ready?\\
296 - One... two... three.\\
297 - What are you guys doing?\\
298 - - Um... - Um...\\
299 - - Uh... - Um...\\
300 - Nothing.\\
301 - You guys trying to scare us?\\
302 - What, are you 12?\\
303 - We weren't trying to scare you.\\
304 - Of course not.\\
305 - That's the opposite of what we were trying to do.\\
306 - We're meeting girls here.\\
307 - Then why are you dressed like that?\\
308 - Because...\\
309 - Um...\\
310 - Uh...\\
311 - Why don't you like us?!\\
312 - I got to say, they had some pretty solid reasons.\\
313 - Come on, Chad.\\
314 - You have to find some way to snap out of this.\\
315 - Look, I went to bat for you.\\
316 - I've been protecting you all day, but this is something I can't cover up.\\
317 - And if your parents find out, they're going to put you away.\\
318 - Are you listening?\\
319 - Yes.\\
320 - Green goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green...\\
321 - Hello, Hal.\\
322 - Evelyn, Lloyd, come on in.\\
323 - So, we were halfway through our first dinner alone in a decade, when someone had to remind me that I didn't give Chad his good night pill.\\
324 - Oh.\\
325 - Okay, well, I'll just, uh, go get him.\\
326 - This in no way justifies what you said before.\\
327 - Chad, I want to show you a little project I've been working on.\\
328 - Look at this.\\
329 - You see where I took my pen and I filled in the letters that needed to be filled in.\\
330 - The "O's," the "A's," the "E's," the "G's."\\
331 - The "Q's," the "P's," the "D's" and the "B's"?\\
332 - Of course.\\
333 - That was you?\\
334 - - What about the nines? - Yes.\\
335 - What about the circles and the percent signs?\\
336 - Absolutely. Otherwise you'll be left with that horrible feeling of uncompleteness.\\
337 - Here they are,\\
338 - sleepover buddies.\\
339 - Has he been okay?\\
340 - Oh, he's been fine.\\
341 - And I think people prejudge Chad sometimes.\\
342 - He's a good kid.\\
343 - Open.\\
344 - I'm sorry, Dad.\\
345 - I thought you were just being...\\
346 - I mean, I had no idea you were...\\
347 - So how crazy are you?\\
348 - Let's just say that's my third set of encyclopedias.\\
349 - If we leave right now, we can still catch the movie.\\
350 - What's this?\\
351 - The warranty?\\
352 - Hey, good for you, Chad.\\
353 - Well, I give up. I'm throwing out that blender.\\
354 - You don't have to. Look what Chad did.\\
355 - Pictures of things belong on the things they're pictures of.\\
356 - Check... and mate.\\
357 - Dewey, what is it?\\
358 - Hal?\\
359 - Honey... I'm sorry.\\
360 - You were lying there asleep and you just looked so beautiful.\\
361 - And the moment was perfect and I never wanted it to end. And then I saw the camera, and...\\
362 - And... I'm weak, Lois.\\
363 - I'm a little man.\\
364 - I know that I can never apologize enough and...\\
365 - I'm sure right now you don't even want to look at me.\\
366 - Hal.\\
367 - Everyone's going to hear about this.\\
368 - We suck.\\
369 - We totally suck.\\
370 - I hate myself so much.\\
371 - What is wrong with us?\\
372 - Everyone else our age heard it "empty house," and we heard "haunted house."\\
373 - Are we just socially stunted in some way that makes us hopeless?\\
374 - I think half of them were really scared.\\
375 - Yeah.

1 - Boy, when you wet the tip, this thing really cracks.\\
2 - Hey, would you hold this for me?\\
3 - What's that on the floor?\\
4 - The poem I wrote about kittens.\\
5 - That's so weird.\\
6 - I guess I have no choice but to bend over...\\
7 - wearing last year's shorts and pick it up.\\
8 - He's really sick, Mom.\\

13 - They're here.\\
14 - Francis and Piama are spending the weekend for Francis' birthday.\\
15 - He's turning 21 tomorrow.\\
16 - I haven't seen Dad this excited since he thought Francis turned 21 last year.\\
17 - Hey, it's the birthday boy. Or should I say birthday man?\\
18 - I know you said not to bring anything, but I brought a salad.\\
19 - Oh, thank you, Piama. That's so thoughtful.\\
20 - I'll just take it in the kitchen and rewash it.\\
21 - Oh...\\
22 - I am so excited.\\
23 - Yeah, it's going to be a great party.\\
24 - No, not the party.\\
25 - The... you know what.\\
26 - Oh.\\
27 - Yeah.\\
28 - Thank you so much. I've been looking forward to this for 12 years.\\
29 - 12 long years.\\
30 - Yes, well...\\
31 - it's going to be everything you dreamed it would.\\
32 - This totally makes the Peter Pan thing worthwhile.\\
33 - Peter Pan?\\
34 - Peter Pan.\\
35 - Peter Pan!\\
36 - Oh, Francis, please. Oh, God, I am so sorry.\\
37 - I didn't know your school play was today.\\
38 - You saw me leave in this costume.\\
39 - Francis, please, stop crying. I am so sorry. Look, I'll do anything to make it up to you.\\
40 - What do you want? I'll do anything.\\
41 - I want to go on a motorcycle trip like you always talk about.\\
42 - Honey, that was way back in college. And you know how your mother feels...\\
43 - I want a motorcycle trip with my dad!\\
44 - Okay. Okay.\\
45 - I'll tell you what.\\
46 - When you turn 21, I promise I will take you on the most awesome, special motorcycle trip, okay?\\
47 - We'll go when you turn 21.\\
48 - Oh, yeah.\\
49 - Motorcycle trip.\\
50 - At first I thought you were just saying it to shut me up.\\
51 - You're just saying this to shut me up.\\
52 - No, son, this is a promise.\\
53 - On the day of your 21st birthday, I swear by all that is holy, you and I will go on a father-son motorcycle trip, so help me God.\\
54 - How are you going to get Mom to let you?\\
55 - I swear on my life, Francis, nothing will stop this.\\
56 - This is the holiest, most sacred promise between a father and a son. Nothing, and I mean nothing, can ever undo this promise!\\
57 - - Boy, I sure liked to nail things down, didn't I? - Oh, yeah. It's going to be great.\\
58 - Wait, wasn't there...?\\
59 - This is sealed in blood.\\
60 - Do you hear me, son? Sealed in blood.\\
61 - Oh, crap.\\
62 - Okay, I'll pitch in three dollars for Francis' birthday present.\\
63 - Me, too.\\
64 - And three from me.\\
65 - So we're agreed.\\
66 - We're giving Francis nine dollars for his birthday.\\
67 - Hey, your friend's outside.\\
68 - What do you mean "friend"?\\
69 - Your friend, Randy somebody. Really big kid.\\
70 - Randy Zane?\\
71 - Yeah, I think he wants to play baseball.\\
72 - What?\\
73 - He's outside right now with his bat.\\
74 - He seems really impatient.\\
75 - You know, I told you boys if you just made an effort you could make friends.\\
76 - You see? You listened to me and it paid off.\\
77 - Just think how much easier your lives would be if you listened to me all the time.\\
78 - God, he looks mad.\\
79 - Which one of us do you think he wants?\\
80 - Reese, it's obviously you.\\
81 - That must've been his bike that you superglued to the train tracks.\\
82 - We don't know that.\\
83 - You were pretty fast and loose with that dog-crap slingshot the other day.\\
84 - How do you know you didn't hit him?\\
85 - What about you?\\
86 - How many people did you convince to buy those algebra pills?\\
87 - You know, our lives would be a lot easier if we didn't all pull this crap at the same time.\\
88 - I suggested a rotating calendar years ago, and you guys ignored me. And here we are.\\
89 - Let's just go tell Mom.\\
90 - We can't.\\
91 - If we send Mom out there, Randy will just tell her what we did, and then they'll both be after us.\\
92 - Did you see that movie where Freddie teamed up with Jason?\\
93 - Is that what you want?\\
94 - Then what do we do?\\
95 - He can't stand out there forever. We'll just wait him out.\\
96 - So what if we have to stay inside for awhile.\\
97 - - Oh, my God, he's still out there. - I think he grew.\\
98 - Why is he smoking two cigarettes?\\
99 - Those are his eyes.\\
100 - Hal, what are you doing?\\
101 - I'm just trying to think of some wise things to say to Francis tomorrow.\\
102 - A father should have some wisdom for his son, don't you think?\\
103 - Well, it is a big day. You only turn 21 once.\\
104 - Hey, remember before he was born and I had that Harley Da...?\\
105 - No motorcycles ever!\\
106 - You do not talk about motorcycles.\\
107 - You do not think, you do not wish, you do not even reminisce about those stupid, idiotic death traps.\\
108 - They do not exist. Motorcycles do not exist.\\
109 - Say it.\\
110 - - Motorcycles do not exist. - What does not exist?\\
111 - - I don't know. - Good.\\
112 - He was out there all night.\\
113 - - Doesn't he get bored? - Do sharks get bored?\\
114 - You know what, we'll just stay inside all day today, too.\\
115 - We can last longer than he can.\\
116 - Mmm.\\
117 - So that's your famous pasta sauce Francis talks so much about?\\
118 - Yeah, I only make it for birthdays and acquittals.\\
119 - One time it was both.\\
120 - I just love the smell of home cooking.\\
121 - Really?\\
122 - Do you know there's a way to get that smell in your own house?\\
123 - Okay, it's all set up.\\
124 - The rental place is delivering two motorcycles to the gas station on 10th and Coolidge.\\
125 - I already have a couple of satchels packed. At 5:30, we'll just slip out and disappear.\\
126 - This is so awesome.\\
127 - So Francis, your birthday dinner starts at 6:00.\\
128 - - I hope you're hungry. - Oh, gosh, I sure am.\\
129 - I'm hungry for all of it. My only problem will be deciding which amazing side dish to eat first.\\
130 - But I guess I'll solve that problem at 6:00 'cause that's when my birthday party starts.\\
131 - Be cool.\\
132 - We're going to be stuck in here forever.\\
133 - It'll be fine.\\
134 - Eventually, he'll get bored, or tired, or die of starvation.\\
135 - But who knows how long that could take?\\
136 - I'm going crazy here. I mean, look at me, I'm reading a book.\\
137 - This is dumb.\\
138 - I'm not going to do this anymore.\\
139 - I'm just going to go out and see if it's me he wants.\\
140 - - What are you, nuts? - I'm not going to live like this.\\
141 - I've been beaten before.\\
142 - I'm just going to get it over with and live the rest of my life.\\
143 - God, he's walking right up to him.\\
144 - Randy's hitting him.\\
145 - He's hitting him. It's not us.\\
146 - You know, for a little kid, he can really take a punch.\\
147 - I can't believe I've been going so easy on him.\\
148 - Give me the tape, and I'll get this side.\\
149 - Oh, I got it.\\
150 - This tape dispenser is tricky. It'll take me longer to explain it.\\
151 - Dewey, are you okay?\\
152 - Boy, that was a beating.\\
153 - I mean, no offense to you guys, but "wow."\\
154 - Why did he beat you up? Did he say?\\
155 - Actually, he said it wasn't me.\\
156 - Then why'd he eat you up?\\
157 - He said it was just a warm-up.\\
158 - Then he said to send out my brother.\\
159 - Which brother, me or Malcolm?\\
160 - He just said "brother."\\
161 - Boy, what a weight off.\\
162 - It's just so great to have this over with. I'm finally free.\\
163 - And I'm getting some major tooth fairy money.\\
164 - You know, Hal, I realized this afternoon we don't have any pictures from any of Francis' birthday parties.\\
165 - I want you to make sure you have plenty of film in the camera.\\
166 - Will do. Get ready for a boatload of memories.\\
167 - Uh, Dad. Can you come out here for a second?\\
168 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
169 - These were supposed to go to the gas station.\\
170 - That's what I'm telling him.\\
171 - Look, this is the address that's on the credit card.\\
172 - But these can't be anywhere near here.\\
173 - You have to take them to the gas station.\\
174 - I'm not even insured to touch these things once they're off the truck.\\
175 - But you know, you want them taken down to the gas station, they are motorcycles.\\
176 - Is everything okay out there, honey?\\
177 - Fine, no problem.\\
178 - Francis just wanted to make sure that we weren't wearing the same outfit tonight.\\
179 - Okay, just help me get these into the garage.\\
180 - Wow. Those are cool.\\
181 - Listen, do not say a word about this. If you just stay quiet, I promise when you turn 21, I will take you on a trip with me on a rocket ship.\\
182 - A rocket ship, Dewey.\\
183 - I swear on my life. I swear on everything that is sacred, as God is my witness.\\
184 - Ow.\\
185 - Oh, how did you...? I don't care.\\
186 - Francis, come on, quickly.\\
187 - - How do I...? - Just kick it into neutral and follow me.\\
188 - Just turn left and gun it!\\
189 - I call you later.\\
190 - I love you.\\
191 - This should have been the greatest day of our lives.\\
192 - Dad and Francis rode motorcycles through the living room, and where were we?\\
193 - Hiding under our beds.\\
194 - "Oh, I'm really looking forward to dinner."\\
195 - What a jerk.\\
196 - I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing to him.\\
197 - All I know is every stroke of this brush strengthens my killing arm.\\
198 - Do you have another bucket?\\
199 - I can get started on the tracks in the living room.\\
200 - Oh, I'll just end up redoing them all myself anyway.\\
201 - Why don't you just watch some TV? Then you'll be out of the way.\\
202 - Lois!\\
203 - No one is as useless as you think I am!\\
204 - My focus should be on hating my husband and planning revenge, not worrying about whether I belong here.\\
205 - You are absolutely right.\\
206 - I'm sorry.\\
207 - You deserve better.\\
208 - Thank you.\\
209 - I appreciate that.\\
210 - So now what?\\
211 - Well, I don't know. We're kind of in uncharted waters here.\\
212 - - Drink? - Absolutely.\\
213 - Oh, man, what a day. What a ride.\\
214 - - That was fantastic! - Yeah.\\
215 - Just wait. Tomorrow we go around the lake to this funky old hot springs you are gonna love.\\
216 - This is the same route I used to take every month with my buddy, Roy,\\
217 - until he got dragged a quarter mile by that school bus.\\
218 - Thanks for doing this, Dad.\\
219 - You know, son, you should always pick battles that are big enough to matter,\\
220 - but small enough to win.\\
221 - Yeah, okay.\\
222 - I say life is the only real counselor.\\
223 - Wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become part of the moral tissue.\\
224 - Dad, you feeling okay?\\
225 - Never mind.\\
226 - Listen, I have got something really special for you.\\
227 - You know, it's kind of a father-son thing to honor the occasion.\\
228 - It was a little expensive, but I am going to sit with my 21-year-old son and share a 21-year-old bottle of Scotch.\\
229 - The guy at Liquor Clown said this was the best.\\
230 - Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sober now. I don't drink anymore.\\
231 - - What? - I'm sober now.\\
232 - I went to AA.\\
233 - What?\\
234 - When did this happen?\\
235 - Last year. It just became a problem, and\\
236 - I kind of bottomed out, so I decided to get some help, and,\\
237 - I've been sober for six months now.\\
238 - And you didn't tell me about this?\\
239 - Well, I'm telling you now.\\
240 - What good is it to tell me now? I'm your father. You could have come to me about this.\\
241 - Instead you go to a bunch of strangers with drinking problems?\\
242 - Well, I'm sorry... I guess.\\
243 - Which one of the 12 steps is the one where you act like your father doesn't exist?\\
244 - Dad, what's the big deal? It was my problem.\\
245 - - I went, and I did what I needed to do to get help. - I'm supposed to help you.\\
246 - I deserved to know.\\
247 - And meanwhile, I plan this whole trip, and now I find out you're sober, and I'm standing here with a bottle of booze like some kind of jackass.\\
248 - You know, it's just a little tough... Wow.\\
249 - It's just little tough to find out.\\
250 - Do you have any other surprises for me? Do I have any grandchildren I never met?\\
251 - - Do you have a boyfriend?! - Dad, come on. This is a nice trip.\\
252 - I want to just enjoy this.\\
253 - I'm going to bed.\\
254 - I liked the thing you said about picking battles.\\
255 - I got it off a billboard.\\
256 - Oh, look at this. You got Francis a watch.\\
257 - That was so nice of you.\\
258 - This is a rare promotional Doobie Brothers EP.\\
259 - Oh. Hal almost cried when he found this at a yard sale.\\
260 - - It still doesn't seem like enough. - Oh, honey, this is just how we get the creative juices flowing.\\
261 - It's tough. You have to make your husband miserable, but I have to make mine miserable  and make it a warning to the other three boys in the house.\\
262 - - Do men ever think about what's gonna happen when they do these stupid things? - No, that's what's weird about men, they never do.\\
263 - I guarantee you those two won't even think about the consequences of their actions\\
264 - until five minutes before they come home.\\
265 - So no matter how low I set the bar, he'll still find a way to crawl under it?\\
266 - You still think there's a bar.\\
267 - That's so cute.\\
268 - Look at him, sleeping peacefully while I'm sitting here going through hell.\\
269 - It's not fair.\\
270 - God, when did this room get so small? I hate this.\\
271 - - Reese, come on, go to sleep. - I can't. I just keep thinking about the beating.\\
272 - How long it'll hurt, how bad it'll be, when it's gonna happen.\\
273 - What if it's on the Fourth of July? That'll ruin it.\\
274 - - I was gonna have pie. - Dude, you have to calm down.\\
275 - - We can wait it out. We can beat this. - I can't take this anymore.\\
276 - I'm going out there. It's probably me he wants, anyway.\\
277 - - Reese, that's stupid. There is no logic in that. - Yes, there is.\\
278 - He is just getting madder and madder. And the longer he has to wait, the worse the beating is going to be.\\
279 - Reese, think about it. Dewey got beat up even though Randy wasn't after him.\\
280 - If you go out there now, he'll beat you up even if you're not the one he wants, just to send a message to me.\\
281 - I don't care anymore.\\
282 - But if you just wait, I'll figure out a way to get out of this.\\
283 - I am not gonna wait while you keep trying to come up with some plan that you'll never come up with.\\
284 - I have to live in the real world.\\
285 - This mud feels fantastic, doesn't it?\\
286 - It's so soothing, I don't even care about all the hundreds of people who left their pubes in here.\\
287 - Come on, Dad. We should be making the most of this.\\
288 - You sulked all the way here, you sulked all the way through the cold plunge, you even sulked when they beat us with juniper branches.\\
289 - Stop being such a baby.\\
290 - I'm sorry I had such high expectations for this trip.\\
291 - For all the trouble I went to, I thought maybe I could maybe be an important part of your life.\\
292 - This has been a nice trip, Dad. This is exactly how I was hoping it would be.\\
293 - It just gets to me, Francis. I mean, how did we get to this point where you're doing all this stuff without me?\\
294 - I mean, you're-you're traveling everywhere, you're getting married, you're doing all these things without even telling me.\\
295 - - And now I find out you even went to AA without telling me? - I can't help it, Dad. I'm a grown-up now. It happens.\\
296 - And I missed it.\\
297 - I mean, here you've grown into this nice, responsible, decent man, and I didn't get to be there for it.\\
298 - I missed you being there, too, Dad.\\
299 - It kind of makes me happy you feel sad about it.\\
300 - - Well, that's something anyway. - Yeah.\\
301 - Five minutes.\\
302 - Holy crap, we've got to get back home! Do you realize how much trouble we're in?\\
303 - Oh, God, you're right. We're dead. We can't go back.\\
304 - No, no, no, no, wait. I'll think of something. I've been married for 20 years, and I've gotten out of a lot of trouble.\\
305 - - Wait, how is it 20 years if I'm 21? - Just shut up and let me think.\\
306 - - Okay. I have something. - What?\\
307 - Ow! God. What the hell was that for?\\
308 - You were in a terrible motorcycle accident that taught you a lesson.\\
309 - Now it's not gonna solve everything, but it's gonna make your apology go down a lot easier because it makes them right,\\
310 - which is what they really want.\\
311 - - Dad, you're brilliant. - There's no time for that. Just do me now.\\
312 - You're gonna want to grab between the second and third knuckle, and go up and back in one smooth motion.\\
313 - But just these two so I can still work the throttle.\\
314 - - I love you, Dad. - I love you, too, son.\\
315 - - You were right, Dewey. I can't tell you how much better I feel. - Told ya.\\
316 - It's really freeing. Especially knowing he still wants the other brother.\\
317 - Malcolm, you got to go out there. It's time. He wants you.\\
318 - No. By October, I'll be strong enough to beat him.\\
319 - Come on, Malcolm. You have school tomorrow. You can pretend to be sick for a few days, but sooner or later, Mom gets involved.\\
320 - - Then what? - I'll think of something.\\
321 - Thinking won't do it, Malcolm. This is not a smart thing. It's a life thing.\\
322 - Randy is like an earthquake. It's just something that's gonna happen.\\
323 - Seriously, Malcolm, the longer you try to put this off, the worse it's gonna to be.\\
324 - I could tell he was holding back. He's got a lot farther he could go.\\
325 - - This is nothing. - No, I'm not giving up. I don't give up.\\
326 - I'm not a quitter. If I have a problem, I think and work and keep working on it until I solve it.\\
327 - Okay, name one time that's ever worked out for you.\\
328 - Well... \\
329 - Did it work five years ago when your hamster died, and you spent so many hours giving it CPR that the doctors had to put a shunt in your mouth to help the sores drain?\\
330 - Did it work with that girl you kept hounding because you thought she was so close to liking you until she finally maced you?\\
331 - No, but I could... I could...\\
332 - Malcolm, think about it.\\
333 - You're right.\\
334 - I really have to go out there.\\
335 - I appreciate you guys looking out for me.\\
336 - We didn't think you'd be so easy to convince.\\
337 - No, not him. Where's the red-haired brother?\\
338 - - There is no red-haired brother. This is it. - Shoot. I have the wrong house.\\
339 - Where's that house with the assbag who works with handicapped kids?\\
340 - Oh, that's Eddie Jeffers. He lives on Comstock.\\
341 - You guys got pounded, and I got off scot-free. Hah! Now whose philosophy looks stupid?\\
342 - You thought I couldn't come up with...\\
343 - Guys, wait. What if we do this tomorrow? You'll be rested. Take some time first.\\
344 - We worked so hard and spent so much on Francis' dinner, it's nice that we can all finally enjoy it.\\
345 - More steak, honey?
\subsection {Episode 17: Butterflies}
1 - Mom didn't go shopping. There's no snacks.\\
2 - I don't want to watch a movie without snacks.\\
3 - There's always...\\
4 - trail mix.\\
5 - Yeah.\\
6 - Trail mix.\\
7 - -Good movie. -Yeah.\\
8 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.17 - Butterflies\\

10 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
11 - Usually I spend every minute I'm at Lucky Aide cursing Mom for making me work here, but lately it hasn't seemed so bad.\\
12 - I'm not sure why.\\
13 - Malcolm, you were right. I put a greasy bag in the fridge, and Craig put his name on it.\\
14 - Yeah, the only way to protect anything is to put it in a nonfat yogurt carton.\\
15 - That's brilliant.\\
16 - Wait. You got something.\\
17 - Thanks.\\
18 - She didn't have anything.\\
19 - So, hey, it turns out I don't have to go with my parents to Yosemite over spring break.\\
20 - So I guess you'll be in town then, huh?\\
21 - Looks like it.\\
22 - You know, me, too. Maybe we can...\\
23 - Malcolm, your break doesn't start for another two minutes.\\
24 - Wendy, your break is over now.\\
25 - This is why orphans get all the hot girls.\\
26 - Oh, God. I've got graveyard shift for the next two weeks?\\
27 - I didn't know I had any joy left in my life to be sucked out.\\
28 - I guess you're going to have to take the bus to work, Malcolm.\\
29 - You're going to be on your own.\\
30 - Great. Figures.\\
31 - If I can bite through my tongue till my teeth meet maybe Mom won't see me smile.\\
32 - All right, here's Jamie's schedule for the next two weeks.\\
33 - -He needs a bath at 6:00, 8:00 and before he goes to bed. -We talked about Jamie's schedule.\\
34 - -I want to talk about our schedule. -We already talked about that schedule.\\
35 - I know, but I like coming home for lunch to be a special treat, not just for my survival.\\
36 - Well, I'm not happy about it either, but working graveyard is just part of the job.\\
37 - Have you told Malcolm you're making him do it with you?\\
38 - Two days ago.\\
39 - -What are you so happy about? -Nothing.\\
40 - I've just never had the whole bed to myself before.\\
41 - You stay off my side of the bed! I don't care if I'm not there.\\
42 - Okay.\\
43 - And stop smiling!\\
44 - Okay.\\
45 - The only bright spot in all this is that Reese has an even crappier spring break job than I do.\\
46 - You didn't do too bad today, kid. Till that possum got up your pant leg, you were way ahead.\\
47 - So... he didn't have rabies, did he?\\
48 - No. No, no, no, no. He checked out fine.\\
49 - Say, uh, you going to be able to sit up soon 'cause we're almost at your house.\\
50 - These fumes are kind of strong. Can I get one of those paper masks next time?\\
51 - Do I look like I'm made of money?\\
52 - You got a different kind of a job tomorrow.\\
53 - What's this?\\
54 - That's a thousand caterpillars.\\
55 - Tomorrow morning, get up before dawn, I want you to go around the neighborhood, sprinkle those on the rose bushes, flower beds, front lawns...\\
56 - And then I want you to take my business card and drop it in the mailbox, you understand?\\
57 - Why do you sound very far away?\\
58 - Don't go to sleep for a while.\\
59 - It sucks you have to work the night shift. Now you're going to miss the party. Debbie's parents are out of town.\\
60 - Probably won't miss much.\\
61 - It's just the same boring people doing the same boring stuff.\\
62 - Whoa, I gotta run. Skinny-dipping starts at midnight.\\
63 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
64 - At what age do you just accept that your life is a piece of rotten garbage and always will be?\\
65 - Twenty-two.\\
66 - But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the heck out of every moment.\\
67 - Take tonight. You're in for a real treat.\\
68 - There's a different rhythm to the night shift.\\
69 - It's a camaraderie, a brotherhood of kindred souls, a nocturnal fraternity of the prowlers of the inky netherworld.\\
70 - -Hello, fellow traveler. -Where's the toothpaste? -I'm on a break.\\
71 - Make sure all the pens are cap-side up with the pocket clips facing forward.\\
72 - This is the benefit of graveyard shift.\\
73 - You don't have all that chaos that goes on during the daytime. You can get things organized the way they're meant to be.\\
74 - You're just trying to torture me. That's why I'm here, just admit it.\\
75 - You're here because you need the money.\\
76 - -I give you three-quarters of my paycheck. -That's why you need the money.\\
77 - That's weird. Did you see anyone?\\
78 - What?\\
79 - Someone left a candy wrapper and change on the counter here, but nobody's been in the store for hours.\\
80 - It was probably a mouse.\\
81 - A mouse that left the exact change?\\
82 - I played tic-tac-toe with a chicken at the county fair, and it beat me eight times in a row.\\
83 - Don't shortchange animals.\\
84 - I didn't see anyone though.\\
85 - Nevermind.\\
86 - Wait, aren't you even curious how that happened?\\
87 - Malcolm, everything doesn't have to be fascinating.\\
88 - Now it looks like the guy in the hockey mask is dead, right? But just keep your eye on that coffin.\\
89 - Hold on.\\
90 - Why aren't you at work?\\
91 - I don't want to hear that you're too good to crawl under houses poisoning rats all day.\\
92 - There are ten guys with MBA's who would love to have that job.\\
93 - I didn't quit. I showed up this morning and the cops were there.\\
94 - It turns out Mr. Krijak was renting out his gas tanks for parties.\\
95 - Now I have to dump this stupid box of caterpillars... for free!\\
96 - Have a nice death, puss-bags.\\
97 - Hey!\\
98 - Get off of me.\\
99 - Oh, a tough guy, huh?\\
100 - Hey...\\
101 - Cut it out, that tickles.\\
102 - Craig, did you do this?\\
103 - Do what?\\
104 - Those vitamins that were recalled.\\
105 - Did you clear off this shelf?\\
106 - Doesn't sound like me.\\
107 - Six coats of wax, and I buttered up my socks.\\
108 - The record's going down.\\
109 - You know, things have been getting really weird around here.\\
110 - I mean, think about it.\\
111 - Last night, all the clocks in the display case were synchronized to the same time.\\
112 - And the night before that,\\
113 - all the fingerprints were cleaned off the freezer doors.\\
114 - Malcolm, I think you're forgetting the graveyard shift motto...\\
115 - "Who cares?"\\
116 - It doesn't matter if no one else knows.\\
117 - You know.\\
118 - Okay, Dewey gets the pancakes and eggs.\\
119 - And Lois has the veal parmesan.\\
120 - Oh, look at you, Jamie.\\
121 - You have changed so much in just a week. Your head's almost symmetrical.\\
122 - Better eat up... don't you need to be in bed before I go to work?\\
123 - Honey, I'm spending sometime with my son who I've barely seen in the last week.\\
124 - You've got 18 years for that.\\
125 - I'm only asking for ten minutes.\\
126 - Wow, another great night's sleep.\\
127 - No fighting for blankets, no elbows in my face, or anything worse.\\
128 - Just all the room in the world.\\
129 - Don't freak out when you get into your side of the bed.\\
130 - It looks bad, but most of it's only a Moon Pie.\\
131 - Did you know the Latin name for this little guy is Danaus plexippus,\\
132 - and that he actually crawls out of his own skin to pupate?\\
133 - Then the outer layer hardens into the chrysalis.\\
134 - That's Greek for "golden."\\
135 - And once they turn into butterflies,\\
136 - they can migrate up to 2,000 miles.\\
137 - Pretty awesome, huh?\\
138 - Oh, got to feed them some more milkweed.\\
139 - Wow.\\
140 - That's the first time I've ever seen Reese take a concerned interest in another living thing.\\
141 - It's kind of nice to know he's got a compassionate side.\\
142 - I want those revolting bugs in the trash by tomorrow morning.\\
143 - Craig.\\
144 - Take a look at this.\\
145 - If you don't mind, I'm trying to get in a quick nap before my break.\\
146 - Seriously. Check out this guy.\\
147 - He's here, and then two hours later...\\
148 - ...he's still there, only in a different outfit.\\
149 - And three hours later, he shows up again in another outfit.\\
150 - Whoa!\\
151 - Did you see that?!\\
152 - Malcolm, please.\\
153 - If I don't get my 16 hours, I'm a bear.\\
154 - What are doing in there?\\
155 - Shopping.\\
156 - You're not shopping.\\
157 - You're the guy from the videotape.\\
158 - You're living here?\\
159 - Malcolm, please. Your mom's going to hear us.\\
160 - How do you know my name? How do you know my mom?\\
161 - I've been here for a while.\\
162 - And you were right about moving the tortilla chips to the salsa aisle. The sales are up at least 15%.\\
163 - I knew it. Wait.\\
164 - How long's "a while?"\\
165 - Three years in January.\\
166 - I was going to move over to foot care, but once you get unpacked, it's...\\
167 - You've been living in this store for three years? Are you crazy?\\
168 - I don't know.\\
169 - I just...\\
170 - Malcolm, I had this super high-pressure job.\\
171 - People were constantly hounding me for answers, decisions, budgets, signatures. My-My nerves were a total wreck.\\
172 - I was wandering around here waiting for my Xanax refill, my-my cell phone and BlackBerry both going off, and I saw this crack.\\
173 - And I decided to hide in there, just for a few minutes, and...\\
174 - ...it was fantastic.\\
175 - I didn't want to leave.\\
176 - And then I didn't, and no one noticed, so I just... stayed.\\
177 - You never left the store in all that time?\\
178 - You guys are pretty well-stocked here. Lots of canned goods, toiletries...\\
179 - Every day I clean a different third of my body in the bathroom sink.\\
180 - -But you can't just live here. -Why not?\\
181 - I-I pay for everything I use,\\
182 - I help out whenever I can. I clean spills, I change light bulbs. I have saved Craig's life at least five times.\\
183 - You're not going to tell on me, are you?\\
184 - I don't know...\\
185 - What about Wendy?\\
186 - I know you like her.\\
187 - And I can help you.\\
188 - I see her all the time. I overhear her conversations.\\
189 - I know everything about her, like why she broke up with her last boyfriend.\\
190 - -Why? -Will you let me stay?\\
191 - Yeah, all right.\\
192 - Okay, so I'm entrusting my love life to a burned-out hermit who lives behind a ball cage.\\
193 - That doesn't make me a desperate loser.\\
194 - I'm doing it anyway.\\
195 - -Okay, Reese... -Shh. Dad, they're pupating.\\
196 - They need peace and quiet while they're developing their delicate new...\\
197 - We got to dump the bugs.\\
198 - What?!\\
199 - Sorry. Your mother wants them gone.\\
200 - No, you can't do this.\\
201 - They never hurt anyone.\\
202 - They have no protection, no one to watch over them.\\
203 - Oh, crap, I'm too late.\\
204 - You bonded with them, didn't you?\\
205 - Well, welcome to my world.\\
206 - Now you're stuck with feelings of unjustified love for a bunch of mindless, ungrateful eating machines.\\
207 - See how you like it.\\
208 - At least yours will be dead in a month.\\
209 - Then I can keep them?\\
210 - Throw them under the tarp with the Playboys.\\
211 - And you better be a sullen jerk to me in front of your mother so she doesn't get wise. You got that?\\
212 - -Go on. -Okay.\\
213 - I overheard her on the phone saying she's sick of guys who play games.\\
214 - She says she just wants someone who's honest and straightforward.\\
215 - That's great. I'm totally honest and straightforward.\\
216 - Actually, you're more like blunt and aggressive.\\
217 - That's okay. You just got to slow down, give yourself a chance.\\
218 - She spent 22 minutes and 18 seconds looking through Hallmark cards. She needs to be treated gently.\\
219 - Here's some stuff she likes.\\
220 - Movies, music, shampoo brands, paper towels...\\
221 - Uh, well, some of it's more useful than others, but learn it all.\\
222 - When the time's right, you can show her how much you have in common with her.\\
223 - Thanks. This is great.\\
224 - Who are you talking to?\\
225 - Um, I was just... singing.\\
226 - Thanks, this is great,\\
227 - As long as we're together, girl.\\
228 - Yeah.\\
229 - In my car.\\
230 - I want you to know something.\\
231 - I've been sleeping in that bed by myself for a week.\\
232 - A week without sharing covers, a week without being smashed, and a week without having anyone's butt shoved into my face.\\
233 - So, what are you angry about?\\
234 - Because during the last week, I've grown half an inch.\\
235 - You lied to me.\\
236 - I'm not the smallest kid in my class from my genetics.\\
237 - It's because I've been stuffed into a bed with Malcolm all my life.\\
238 - Whoo, you don't know that.\\
239 - It could be all the crap we feed you, or the chemical plant near the park.\\
240 - -Dad... -Dewey, I'm sorry.\\
241 - But we can't afford to buy you your own bed. You'll just have to grow after Malcolm goes off to college.\\
242 - Oh, no, then Jamie's going into it.\\
243 - Well, at least you'll always be bigger than he is.\\
244 - Yesterday, I passed Wendy at the time clock and casually mentioned how I liked the smell of bookstores.\\
245 - She was so charmed, I didn't even care how stupid that is.\\
246 - All right, what's going on?\\
247 - What are you talking about?\\
248 - You haven't complained about one thing in the last week.\\
249 - The only time you don't complain is when you're hiding something from me.\\
250 - I'm not hiding anything from you.\\
251 - Malcolm.\\
252 - There you are.\\
253 - Remember last week when you were trying to figure out how that spill got cleaned up?\\
254 - No.\\
255 - But remember those vitamins getting pulled from the shelf, and the ice cream case getting cleaned,\\
256 - and those socks being left out to dry and all those other things that seemed like they were happening by themselves?\\
257 - Not now, Craig.\\
258 - I figured it out. I know what's going on.\\
259 - The store is haunted.\\
260 - Craig...\\
261 - -All right, what's in this bag? -Nothing. I'm restocking.\\
262 - Fresh fruit?\\
263 - A package of all-cotton underwear?\\
264 - A decent book?\\
265 - We don't sell this stuff.\\
266 - Okay, fine.\\
267 - If you must know, I was restocking my locker.\\
268 - I've been having intense stomach problems, and that's what the fruit is for, and the underwear, and sadly, the book, too.\\
269 - And now that you've publicly humiliated me, can I go about my business?\\
270 - Okay, not bad. It's plausible, embarrassing enough for the outburst, and essentially unprovable.\\
271 - I just have to stand my ground.\\
272 - Attention Lucky Aide trespasser.\\
273 - You do not get to do this. You do not get to live off the grid.\\
274 - If anyone on the planet was entitled to hide from all the aggravation, it would be me, but I don't, do you understand?\\
275 - No one gets to shirk their share of the misery.\\
276 - Everyone has to be stuck in this together. That's what's fair. Those are the rules.\\
277 - Now, you obviously know me, so you know what I'm willing to do to find you.\\
278 - So save us both the time and come out now.\\
279 - Let me handle this.\\
280 - Do you know anything about a guy living in the store?\\
281 - No!\\
282 - No, Reese, you're not coming in here with those.\\
283 - But they'll freeze to death out there!\\
284 - I'm sorry, son. I already promised your mom I would get rid of them.\\
285 - And I have four or five other lies in the fire I can't jeopardize.\\
286 - The bugs stay outside.\\
287 - Fine.\\
288 - Then I'll...\\
289 - I'll... I'll fight you for it.\\
290 - Reese, you already fought me for the last English muffin two weeks ago, and I cleaned your clock.\\
291 - But this time, I'm fighting for something I love even more than those muffins.\\
292 - Keep your voice down. You're going to wake Jamie.\\
293 - Good. I want him to hear what kind of heartless monster his father really is.\\
294 - Come on, old man, let's go.\\
295 - All right. But if I throw my back out again beating you up, I am going to kick the crap out of you.\\
296 - Well, the police are on their way.\\
297 - Three years you've been living here. Unbelievable.\\
298 - Didn't you once give me the Heimlich maneuver in Snacks and Nuts?\\
299 - You've got to learn to chew.\\
300 - Easier said, my friend.\\
301 - Mom, can't you just let him go?\\
302 - He didn't even really do anything wrong.\\
303 - He paid for everything he took.\\
304 - He helped out around the store. The guy's just living here.\\
305 - What's wrong with that?\\
306 - I could just disappear, go to the Wal-Mart down the block. I've heard great things about them.\\
307 - He broke the rules, Malcolm.\\
308 - The rules matter.\\
309 - Rules say we get paid time and a half for the graveyard shift.\\
310 - The rules say trespassers are dealt with by the police.\\
311 - You can't just pick and choose what rules you want to follow, or the whole system breaks down.\\
312 - -But... -Malcolm, I'm sorry.\\
313 - But as long as I'm working here, I can't bend the rules for anyone.\\
314 - 7:30. Shift's over.\\
315 - What are you doing?\\
316 - I'm off the clock. I'm going home.\\
317 - Everybody else can do whatever they want.\\
318 - But they better do it quick. They don't have a lot of time.\\
319 - -Thank you. -For what?\\
320 - Great. She lets that guy walk, but makes a federal case whenever I put my phone number in with the birth control pills.\\
321 - -Hi, Malcolm. -Oh, hey, Wendy.\\
322 - Did you get the blue irises I sent you?\\
323 - Yeah, I did.\\
324 - How did you know those were my favorite flowers?\\
325 - Well, you know, I guess we just really have a lot in common.\\
326 - Like loving grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches and Stephen King books.\\
327 - I wouldn't be surprised if you were a big Coldplay fan, too.\\
328 - What the hell are you doing?\\
329 - Following me around? Are you stalking me?\\
330 - No. No, no. I guess we're just really in sync.\\
331 - -Is that so weird? I mean, sometimes two people... -You stay away from me, creep.\\
332 - Don't worry, buddy.\\
333 - Even I get that sometimes.\\
334 - Dad, the toilet lid was up, and Jamie's tongue is blue again.\\
335 - Did you spend all night out there?\\
336 - My choice.\\
337 - It's very bracing out there.\\
338 - Now why don't you help me into the shower and see if we can't save your dad's toes.\\
339 - Oh, my God.\\
340 - Winston, is that you?\\
341 - Geez.\\
342 - I thought you were going to look totally gay as a butterfly, but you look amazing.\\
343 - Harv?\\
344 - And Julio.\\
345 - I knew you'd be one of the first.\\
346 - You were always the head of the class.\\
347 - This is fantastic.\\
348 - Look at all of you guys.\\
349 - Wow.\\
350 - I forgot how many of you there were.\\
351 - Okay.\\
352 - That's a lot of fluttering.\\
353 - That's enough.\\
354 - Get off of me.\\
355 - Get the hell off of me!\\
356 - Help!\\
357 - Help!\\
358 - Good news. Wendy's restraining order has been reduced from 100 feet to 50 feet.\\
359 - If I can yell loud enough, I think I can straighten this out.\\
360 - It's so good to have you back.\\
361 - -Oh. You coming home for lunch? -Mm, and coffee break.\\
362 - No, no!\\
363 - Okay, one more week, then that joke's off limits.
\subsection {Episode 18: Ida's Dance}
1 - <b>NOTICE OF SUSPENSION</b>\\
2 - Here you go, Jamie.\\
3 - What are you doing?\\
4 - Mom's been going through the trash.\\
5 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.18 - Ida's Dance\\
6 - Synchronisation par Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
7 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
8 - Check it out.\\
9 - This is my homework.\\
10 - I've spent every night this year cramming my skull full of integral calculus and conversational Latin.\\
11 - I just needed one class that wasn't going to kill me.\\
12 - And then I saw it... Music Appreciation.\\
13 - It's an actual class.\\
14 - All I have to do is listen to a CD and write down how it makes me feel.\\
15 - It's such an easy "A."\\
16 - No matter how easy an "A" is, a "D" is always easier, Malcolm.\\
17 - Not in this class. I better get started on my homework.\\
18 - "F"!\\
19 - I can't believe that goateed moron gave me an "F."\\
20 - "You obviously didn't even listen to the piece."\\
21 - I listened to it. You saw me.\\
22 - You know, with the right kind of pen, you can turn that "F" into a "P."\\
23 - Mom? Finally!\\
24 - Where have you been?\\
25 - I've been calling for weeks. I must have left ten messages.\\
26 - What on Earth is going on up there?\\
27 - I'm busy.\\
28 - Gorga, Ludwina and Marica need me to help make pickles for the festival.\\
29 - Mom, what are you talking about? Gorga? Marica?\\
30 - Marica's Ludwina's cousin.\\
31 - She married the sailor with the milky eye.\\
32 - And she knows the curse to give you warts.\\
33 - -You're not making any sense. -I have to go. They're calling me.\\
34 - Oh, my God, Hal. She's lost her mind. She thinks she's back in her old village.\\
35 - I have to go up there.\\
36 - Why?\\
37 - Hal, she has one leg, she's demented. She could wander out onto a freeway.\\
38 - I thought we agreed we'd take no extraordinary measures to prolong her life.\\
39 - Fine.\\
40 - There we go.\\
41 - If Mommy asks, you got a bath.\\
42 - -Did you get it? -Oh, yeah.\\
43 - Exhumed Maniac.\\
44 - The guy at the video store said it even creeped him out, and he's an albino.\\
45 - Oh, I love scary movies.\\
46 - There's nothing so primal as a man coming face-to-face with what really terrifies him.\\
47 - We'll keep this a secret from your mother.\\
48 - Got it.\\
49 - There's commercials she won't let me watch.\\
50 - Well, she's gone for five days, we can have a film festival.\\
51 - Now, the thing about horror films is that it's always what they don't show that's scary,\\
52 - because nothing on the screen can ever be as truly frightening as what we imagin...\\
53 - I'm glad they shoved that guy's skin down his throat.\\
54 - I didn't think he'd ever stop screaming.\\
55 - I have a favor to ask.\\
56 - I'm taking Music Appreciation, but I'm not doing so well.\\
57 - I have to get an "A" in this class.\\
58 - I know you know about this stuff, so I'm willing to pay you ten bucks an hour to teach me until I get it right, okay?\\
59 - "The Adagio for Organ and Strings" makes you happy?\\
60 - Are you going to help me or not?\\
61 - So let me get this straight.\\
62 - You, the brilliant genius Malcolm, are coming to me, your little brother, for help on your homework?\\
63 - Yes, Dewey, that's right.\\
64 - So you're a total idiot at music?\\
65 - Yes, Dewey, it seems that way.\\
66 - That's probably why you're such a drag to be around.\\
67 - Yes, Dewey, that's probably why I'm such a drag to be around.\\
68 - Interesting.\\
69 - And that must be why you're hitting yourself.\\
70 - Is this gonna take long?\\
71 - Depends how fast you obey.\\
72 - And that must be why you're hitting yourself.\\
73 - Mom.\\
74 - Oh, thank God you're all right.\\
75 - What are you doing here?\\
76 - Mrs. Kucheck next door told me you were down here.\\
77 - She also said to stop stealing her newspaper.\\
78 - I told her she's free to fight me for it.\\
79 - You didn't return my calls for two weeks.\\
80 - -I was worried. -Oh, yes, so worried.\\
81 - You get the earrings, Susan gets the bracelet. Now go home.\\
82 - Mother...\\
83 - -What is this place? -It's wonderful.\\
84 - It's like being back in the village. Everyone here is from the old country.\\
85 - They got the right kind of pickles.\\
86 - They know the old songs. After 50 years in this stink-hole of a country, I finally feel like I fit in.\\
87 - Wow, I felt surrounded when there was just one of you.\\
88 - You going to introduce her to us or make us wait around like a pack of pigs?\\
89 - Pack of pigs wouldn't leave their nail clippings on the floor for other people to step on.\\
90 - This is my daughter, Lois.\\
91 - Gorga.\\
92 - Ludwina.\\
93 - Big Kathy. Little Kathy.\\
94 - Marica. Floransa.\\
95 - Anca. And Mushka.\\
96 - Is this the fat daughter or the one who drinks?\\
97 - This is the one with the half-wit factory between her legs.\\
98 - Well, I don't know what to say. I planned on two days to get you into an old folks home,\\
99 - two days to fight the court challenge, then I'd fly back on Sunday.\\
100 - Now I'm stuck here... it's $300 just to change my ticket.\\
101 - Good. You'll be here for the festival Saturday.\\
102 - What festival?\\
103 - You stop it.\\
104 - You know it's Saint Grotus's Day.\\
105 - Oh, my God. Saint Grotus's Day? That's still around?\\
106 - It is. And we haven't turned our church into a Burger King either.\\
107 - She's being modest.\\
108 - She was a terrific Grotus Day dancer. Made your children look like poisoned sheep.\\
109 - Best girl between the vlatnis in 15 counties!\\
110 - Not the vlatnis.\\
111 - God, I hated that awful vlatny dance.\\
112 - You loved it. She begged to go.\\
113 - She dragged me seven blocks by my pigtails to some stinking butcher shop full of drunk uncles.\\
114 - I couldn't even see my feet through the flies and the cigarette smoke.\\
115 - When I was 16, I worked up the nerve to tell her I wanted to quit. She fed me nothing but bark for a week.\\
116 - It's her stupid idea of a joke.\\
117 - You're not around fancy big-shots with all their teeth, sipping wine.\\
118 - These are real people. You will not embarrass me in front of my friends by spitting on who you are and where you come from.\\
119 - Fine.\\
120 - Oh. Boshnik bread.\\
121 - I haven't had this in years.\\
122 - Does it work or just cram its face with bread?\\
123 - She works.\\
124 - And not on her back like your slut daughter.\\
125 - Can she make a Saint Grotus's Day tart?\\
126 - I'd have left her in the forest with her hand nailed to a stump if she didn't.\\
127 - You will make the tart this year.\\
128 - The tart? By myself? That thing is gigantic.\\
129 - Yes, let Ida's daughter rest.\\
130 - The old ladies with arthritis can make the Saint his tart.\\
131 - Ida's daughter can sit on her gigantic ass all day and eat bread.\\
132 - Jelly, dear?\\
133 - Fine.\\
134 - I'm here for five days. I was expecting to be miserable anyway.\\
135 - I'll make the tart.\\
136 - We got it started for you.\\
137 - No! Not my eyes!\\
138 - Not my baby's eyes, too!\\
139 - Hey, Dad.\\
140 - What do you want?!\\
141 - I wanted to trade my Fruit Roll-Up for a strawberry one?\\
142 - Sorry, son. Of course you can.\\
143 - But ask for it like a man. Don't go creeping around the kitchen.\\
144 - I'll just come back later. You seem busy.\\
145 - Hey, Dad.\\
146 - Check out tonight's movie.\\
147 - They Peeled My Face.\\
148 - The director went to jail for using real corpses.\\
149 - Listen, Reese, I wanted to talk about movie night.\\
150 - Really?\\
151 - I wasn't going to say anything 'cause it's so gay to talk about feelings,\\
152 - but I used to feel bad that we don't spend any time together.\\
153 - And now I find out that the one thing I like the most, that everyone else thinks is creepy, my dad likes it, too.\\
154 - -How great is that? -Really great.\\
155 - Does it have to be so hot? It's, like, 95 degrees in here.\\
156 - Yes, we'll turn on the air-conditioning and let the tart collapse so you can live like a movie star.\\
157 - -Let's see how you did. -No, it's not done yet.\\
158 - I was nine hours into it when you made me start over because the almonds weren't facing Vadutz.\\
159 - You made vomit.\\
160 - The Saint killed our enemies, then went to hell to ask Jesus to increase the severity of their punishment, and you reward him with vomit?\\
161 - You might as well wipe yourself with the beard of the Most Holy Patriarch.\\
162 - Why is my tart vomit?\\
163 - Stop your temper tantrum!\\
164 - Look here. The 15th layer... you put apricots.\\
165 - Is that correct?\\
166 - The Saint didn't slaughter the peacemakers on the 15th. He waited till the 16th when they trusted him.\\
167 - This thing has, like, 35 layers. Who's gonna know where the apricots are?\\
168 - So if you steal and no one knows, that makes it okay?\\
169 - I taught her better than that, till my arm was going to fall off.\\
170 - She has to start over.\\
171 - What?\\
172 - This is ridiculous.\\
173 - Don't blame yourself, Ida.\\
174 - She was born rotten.\\
175 - That's why the goat refused to breast-feed her.\\
176 - Can I at least have a rag to tie around my head to keep the sweat out of my eyes?\\
177 - Yes, Your Majesty.\\
178 - We have to start from the very begining.\\
179 - What do you feel ?\\
180 - I don't feel anything.\\
181 - It's just dinging, and it's annoying.\\
182 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
183 - Babies understand this music.\\
184 - I'll tell you what's wrong with me. You're teaching me bad on purpose.\\
185 - Great. Now you're stupid and crazy.\\
186 - Am I?\\
187 - I asked to learn the one thing that makes you special, your stupid music,\\
188 - but you can't stand that, can you?\\
189 - You've been sabotaging me from day one.\\
190 - That's it. I quit.\\
191 - You can't.\\
192 - -You made a promise. -I did not.\\
193 - We tried everything and you're an idiot.\\
194 - You are not walking away from this, Dewey.\\
195 - You're going to help me beat this.\\
196 - I don't care.\\
197 - Fail your course.\\
198 - I dropped that class last week.\\
199 - Then why are you bothering me?\\
200 - Because you know music and I don't and that's not fair.\\
201 - It's totally fair.\\
202 - You just hate that you don't get to be better than everybody at everything all the time.\\
203 - Music's my only thing. And you know what?\\
204 - It's greater than everything you have put together, because it's about beauty and love and feeling,\\
205 - and not about proving what a creepy little genius you are to everybody, so excuse me.\\
206 - I'm going to appreciate music.\\
207 - It's all the sweeter because I know you can't.\\
208 - Oh, my God. Dewey. Are you okay?\\
209 - I'm sorry.\\
210 - I'm deaf. I'm deaf.\\
211 - Oh, my God.\\
212 - -Mom's gonna kill us! -Shut up. Calm down.\\
213 - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\\
214 - Your hearing will probably come back in a while.\\
215 - Please, just don't say anything, okay?\\
216 - Let's just keep this quiet for a while.\\
217 - Do you understand?\\
218 - Does a punch mean yes?\\
219 - Good.\\
220 - Well, I finished.\\
221 - I almost gave up when I thought I burned the prunes.\\
222 - But then I fell into this rhythm, and I just lost track of time.\\
223 - The next thing you know, it's done.\\
224 - And it came out perfect.\\
225 - It was a lot of work, but you know something?\\
226 - It feels good.\\
227 - What's that?\\
228 - That's the real tart.\\
229 - You kept screwing up.\\
230 - We just knew it would be easier for everyone if we just made it ourselves.\\
231 - But I worked for days!\\
232 - I'm sorry.\\
233 - I know you'd rather be at the disco shaking your backside at a bunch of drug addicts.\\
234 - You like St. Grotus's Day?!\\
235 - Huh?!\\
236 - You like tarts?!\\
237 - Well, what are we waiting for?\\
238 - Let's celebrate!\\
239 - Well, maybe next time you'll think better before criticizing other people's desserts.\\
240 - What are you doing?\\
241 - Oh, Malcolm.\\
242 - I didn't hear you.\\
243 - I wonder why.\\
244 - Why don't you have a seat?\\
245 - Now I know some people say an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\\
246 - But I think it's simple fairness.\\
247 - I don't know what you're talking about. Just say what you mean.\\
248 - You seem confused.\\
249 - You want me to help you?\\
250 - Well, let's see if I can make it loud and clear.\\
251 - I can't do it.\\
252 - I guess I'm just a better person than you are.\\
253 - You know, there's some diabetes medicine in the fridge you may want to destroy.\\
254 - I am not going to be the bad guy in this, Mother.\\
255 - I just want to understand my daughter's behavior.\\
256 - Why are you so frustrated?\\
257 - Is your husband failing to perform his shameful duty?\\
258 - Mother, just shut up, and leave me alone.\\
259 - After all the Saint did for us, all the enemy churches he burned, why would you destroy his holy cookie?\\
260 - It doesn't even taste good.\\
261 - It's not supposed to taste good. It's supposed to be hard to make.\\
262 - I can't believe you would humiliate me in front of my friends!\\
263 - Friends?\\
264 - Those women are monsters. They treat me like garbage.\\
265 - How can they be your friends?\\
266 - I need some people I can talk to, Lois!\\
267 - Well, you used to need me!\\
268 - I'm going.\\
269 - All right. So now we're both deaf,\\
270 - but that's okay.\\
271 - We've had a while to practice now and we're pretty confident we can hide it from Dad!\\
272 - Boys, listen, I'm going to grab the TV and hide it till your mother gets back.\\
273 - I'm going to tell Reese that it was stolen by junkies, desperate for a quick fix.\\
274 - If he ever suspects, you didn't hear it from me. Oh!\\
275 - Hey, Dad.\\
276 - The guy at the video store finally admitted they have a secret room behind the snuff films.\\
277 - I'm going to go check it out.\\
278 - Sounds like a plan.\\
279 - Boys... give me a hand here.\\
280 - Boys, help!\\
281 - Boys!\\
282 - Help... me!\\
283 - For God sakes, what's wrong with you?!\\
284 - Save your father's eyes!\\
285 - This makes up for everything.\\
286 - Is that supposed to impress me?\\
287 - Mother, I swear to God I almost quit twice between the first and the second corset.\\
288 - -I'm this close to... -All right.\\
289 - You want to dance... we dance.\\
290 - What are you doing?\\
291 - I'm not dancing in this thing.\\
292 - It just gets in the way.\\
293 - Begin we now the wushny sabor!\\
294 - The dance where mistakes are long remembered.\\
295 - More drinking!\\
296 - Noroc!\\
297 - Noroc, Mother.\\
298 - Noroc.\\
299 - The lato vlatnis.\\
300 - Hard as a Cossack's heart.\\
301 - Sharp as a raven's beak.\\
302 - Oh, crap. I hate the knives.\\
303 - You think your dad getting killed by a TV set is funny?!\\
304 - I'll tell you what's funny!\\
305 - Being grounded for the rest of your lives!\\
306 - After about an hour, he managed to spit a piece of glass into my lap.\\
307 - You got to admire that kind of perseverance.\\
308 - Your children and your children's children will grow up grounded in this house!\\
309 - I can't hear what he's saying.\\
310 - But judging by the color of his face, I probably shouldn't ask for the car this weekend.\\
311 - Dad, come on. I've got something to show you.\\
312 - We'll use this system until Mom comes home, then say it was defective, and get a refund.\\
313 - Tonight's going to feel like we're actually inside the guy's torso.\\
314 - Son, sit down.\\
315 - Listen...\\
316 - These movies are torture for me.\\
317 - I chewed blisters into my fingers, I can't sleep, I'm afraid of everything. But...\\
318 - I love you, and I love spending time with you.\\
319 - Oh.\\
320 - Like me and baseball.\\
321 - What?\\
322 - Like when you were so excited to teach me baseball when I was six, and I couldn't tell you how totally boring it is.\\
323 - But... that look on your face when I got you your first mitt?\\
324 - It's the same face I use when I get underwear for Christmas.\\
325 - "Wow, it's like you read my mind!"\\
326 - It's not so bad.\\
327 - We're both just liars for a good cause.\\
328 - Yeah.\\
329 - Like that stupid camping trip.\\
330 - I loved that camping trip.\\
331 - That's what I meant.\\
332 - Hi, Dewey.\\
333 - Mom.\\
334 - Your voice.\\
335 - Your beautiful voice.\\
336 - I can hear you.\\
337 - Well, it's nice to see you too, honey.\\
338 - Every morning those damn birds. They can't keep...\\
339 - Wait. I can hear.\\
340 - I can hear. Oh, my God, I'm so happy.

10 - A motivation seminar.\\
11 - For the whole weekend!\\
12 - Can you believe this?\\
13 - Like I need motivation.\\
14 - And they just told you about it today?\\
15 - They claim it was in some "memo" they sent me three months ago.\\
16 - So now, suddenly my job includes weekend seminars and memo-reading.\\
17 - Can they really force you to go?\\
18 - Lois, they can make you do anything.\\
19 - Once you sign up for a job in this country, you give away the whole kit and kaboodle.\\
20 - Our weekends, our house, our kids... we don't own any of it.\\
21 - Okay, everybody, dinner.\\
22 - This is all just an exercise to remind the little man who's boss.\\
23 - They're just trying to motivate me to keep me in my place...\\
24 - to kill any dreams I might have of ever digging my way out...\\
25 - Oh, my God, it starts at 9:00?\\
26 - Sorry. I forgot how late it was.\\
27 - Why are your fingernails clean?\\
28 - Did you clean your fingernails?\\
29 - I thought I'd try it, and it turns out I like it.\\
30 - It makes me feel good about myself.\\
31 - Well, that's enough of that. It's time for dinner.\\
32 - Damn. Pack of dogs is in the garbage again.\\
33 - Go away. Scat.\\
34 - You know why they like our trash is Jamie's dirty diapers.\\
35 - If he digested his food a little better, there wouldn't be so much for them to eat in there.\\
36 - Filthy, disgusting animals.\\
37 - You know, Mom, if you double-bagged the trash, the dogs might not be able to smell it.\\
38 - Uh-oh. Reese just made the classic mistake of expressing an interest in something that Mom said.\\
39 - All right, Reese, since you're so full of good ideas, why don't you be in charge of cleaning up the garbage from now on.\\
40 - If he just shuts up now, it might not get any worse.\\
41 - I don't see why it matters if some dogs dump a little garbage on our lawn.\\
42 - The backyard's a mess already.\\
43 - Oh, this is hard to watch.\\
44 - Hey, get lost. Get out of here.\\
45 - You come back to laugh at me?\\
46 - You think you're so smart?\\
47 - I am a human being.\\
48 - I am probably smarter than the smartest dog that's ever lived.\\
49 - Now shoo. Shoo.\\
50 - I've got a gun!\\
51 - You make one step, and you're all getting it.\\
52 - Go away!\\
53 - Hey, that's mine! Give it back!\\
54 - Reese, where have you been all night?\\
55 - I started chasing these dogs, and it turned out they were really cool.\\
56 - So we went to the park, and then we found a tennis ball.\\
57 - And I took it from Toffe, and then Toffe took it from me and gave it to Rusty.\\
58 - And then we drank some water.\\
59 - And then we turned over some trash cans.\\
60 - Then Lucky did this hilarious thing where he rubs his butt on the ground.\\
61 - I can't do it.\\
62 - So then we chased this cat that was all like, "Aw!"\\
63 - Stupid cat.\\
64 - Then we stopped at the 7-Eleven, and I went inside and had a Coke while they had some burritos out of the Dumpster.\\
65 - Spike ate his twice.\\
66 - Wait a minute. You spent the night in a dog pack?\\
67 - Yeah. So then there were these squirrels who were like, "We're up in a tree, you'll never get us."\\
68 - You're talking about them like they're friends.\\
69 - They're just animals.\\
70 - Well, I'm sorry that we're not like your friends, sitting around all intellectual, discussing multiplication.\\
71 - You can't get into bed like that. You stink.\\
72 - Hey, I got checked out pretty thoroughly in that department, and I didn't hear any complaints.\\
73 - Every one of you is here because you're successful.\\
74 - Successful at letting yourself down.\\
75 - Nobody's better at settling,\\
76 - making excuses,\\
77 - shortchanging yourself and those who count on you.\\
78 - Congratulations.\\
79 - You all got here the exact same way:\\
80 - one step at a time.\\
81 - Postpone that dream.\\
82 - Reduce that goal.\\
83 - It's just another year.\\
84 - It's just another cookie...\\
85 - Now you tell yourself it's good enough.\\
86 - It's not good enough!\\
87 - You think you can't help it, but you can.\\
88 - I'm going to tear away the nonsense,\\
89 - the dime store philosophies, the catchphrases\\
90 - and bring out your inner Viking.\\
91 - Scott Porter.\\
92 - It says here you'd rather not talk about your recent divorce.\\
93 - Sorry I missed lunch.\\
94 - I was at the library, and I forgot to look at the clock...\\
95 - Do you think I'm a idiot?\\
96 - Huh?\\
97 - Do you think I don't know where you've been?\\
98 - What do you mean?\\
99 - Did you think I wouldn't recognize the signs?\\
100 - The clean fingernails, good posture,\\
101 - the cookie crumbs in your pockets.\\
102 - You're never hungry at dinnertime.\\
103 - You're seeing another mom.\\
104 - I don't know what you're talking about.\\
105 - Don't lie to me!\\
106 - It's not what you think.\\
107 - Who is she?\\
108 - -Why does that matter? -Who is she?!\\
109 - Mrs. Finnegan.\\
110 - It doesn't mean anything.\\
111 - A couple of weeks ago I stopped by her house, and she had her iron out.\\
112 - She was just so nice, and there was cake.\\
113 - Well, it'll be a long time before you get any cake around here.\\
114 - I wasn't expecting any.\\
115 - After everything I've sacrificed for you, all I've done...\\
116 - you come waltzing in here day after day, reeking of her fabric softener.\\
117 - Yes. I like fabric softener.\\
118 - Mrs. Finnegan doesn't mind taking a little time to stop the rinse cycle.\\
119 - And maybe it's nice to have someone who's got more to say to me than just, "Clean your room," "Comb your hair"...\\
120 - Do you love her?\\
121 - Of course not.\\
122 - It's just snacks.\\
123 - Oh, you like her snacks?\\
124 - You like filling up on her cookies?\\
125 - You know they're store-bought.\\
126 - That's beneath you, Mom.\\
127 - Doesn't feel good, does it?\\
128 - Well, you're not here to feel good.\\
129 - You're here to face the lies you tell yourself.\\
130 - You can stop. I think I'm at bottom now.\\
131 - You're not at bottom.\\
132 - I'll tell you when you're at bottom.\\
133 - You think you're fooling anybody with those vertical stripes?\\
134 - What are you, 30 pounds overweight?\\
135 - You might as well be a thousand pounds overweight.\\
136 - Is anyone in this room attracted to her?\\
137 - Do you want to know what you have to do, Angela?\\
138 - Hello.\\
139 - Aw, geez, really?\\
140 - I got to go.\\
141 - Hey, shouldn't somebody...?\\
142 - Angela?\\
143 - What do I do?!\\
144 - Hey... come on...\\
145 - you know...\\
146 - Yes.\\
147 - You're right.\\
148 - I do know.\\
149 - Of course I know.\\
150 - Thank you!\\
151 - Can you do me?\\
152 - Oh, who am I kidding?\\
153 - Guys, I need a night off. I've been out with you I very night this week.\\
154 - They really want me to come.\\
155 - Reese, this is crazy.\\
156 - What could you possibly be getting out of this?\\
157 - You don't know how good it feels.\\
158 - You know where you stand with these guys.\\
159 - I've got Toffe and Jonesy under me,\\
160 - but I'm under Duke, Chewy and Spike.\\
161 - Scout tried to cross the highway yesterday, so I moved up.\\
162 - And Lucky's totally the boss.\\
163 - There's no phonies. You know what a growl means, you know what a lick means.\\
164 - You're kidding yourself.\\
165 - You're not one of them.\\
166 - You're just jealous 'cause I'm popular.\\
167 - Morning.\\
168 - Hi, honey. How was the seminar?\\
169 - Unbe-freaking-lievable.\\
170 - I haven't slept in 48 hours.\\
171 - The Viking guy had to leave suddenly, so I stepped in, and I started talking to people about their lives.\\
172 - And honey, I got to tell you, I have wisdom.\\
173 - Nobody was more surprised than me,\\
174 - but I did so well they have me leading motivational seminars for the next eight weekends.\\
175 - Wow.\\
176 - This is the beginning of something, Lois.\\
177 - The bosses are seeing me in a whole new light.\\
178 - Did they cross you off the probation list?\\
179 - In ink.\\
180 - Morning, son.\\
181 - Hi, Dad.\\
182 - Thanks, Mom.\\
183 - I called Mrs. Finnegan.\\
184 - You what?\\
185 - She knows I know.\\
186 - You're never seeing her again.\\
187 - I can't believe you told her we had an understanding.\\
188 - Morning.\\
189 - Reese, I need you to put your dirty clothes in the hamper before you leave this morning.\\
190 - I already did it, Mom.\\
191 - You did? Why?\\
192 - I feel bad I haven't always pulled my weight around here.\\
193 - I mean, you're the leader. It's my place to respect you.\\
194 - Well... thank you, Reese.\\
195 - Hey.\\
196 - Good morning, Malcolm.\\
197 - There's money on the counter for your yearbook.\\
198 - I don't want to buy a yearbook.\\
199 - I don't want anything that will remind me I ever went to that stupid school.\\
200 - how can you say that?\\
201 - Being part of a group is important.\\
202 - Don't you care about loyalty?\\
203 - I think loyalty is the most important thing there is.\\
204 - Well, I'm glad at least one of my sons knows something about that.\\
205 - Hey! What are you doing here?!\\
206 - This isn't your house! You don't live here!\\
207 - We live here! This is our house!\\
208 - What do you want?! Huh?!\\
209 - What?! What?! What?!\\
210 - What?! What?!\\
211 - What?!\\
212 - What?! What?!\\
213 - You'll have to climb the ladder of achievement one rung at a time.\\
214 - You'll never reach the top if you don't start climbing.\\
215 - And when you reach the top,\\
216 - you realize that the journey never ends.\\
217 - Excuse me.\\
218 - If you're at the top, how come the journey doesn't end?\\
219 - Because at the top of the ladder,\\
220 - there's a car.\\
221 - The question is, will you be driving?\\
222 - Or just a passenger?\\
223 - Whenever you let somebody else drive, he might have errands to do.\\
224 - Where do you think he might stop?\\
225 - The dry cleaners?\\
226 - Very good.\\
227 - Where else?\\
228 - Drugstore?\\
229 - Yes!\\
230 - Where else? Tim?\\
231 - There's a place you can go to have your shoes treated so they won't develop a smell over time.\\
232 - Excellent!\\
233 - Okay, now... what does all this... mean?\\
234 - It means nothing.\\
235 - It means nothing!\\
236 - This is what happens when you let somebody else drive the car.\\
237 - You've all got to be the drivers of your own car.\\
238 - And what do you do if the gas gauge says your tank is empty?\\
239 - Stop at a gas station?\\
240 - No! You keep driving! You don't let anything stop you.\\
241 - Let me hear some "Vroom."\\
242 - You know!\\
243 - Excuse me, Hal. I need to have bathroom break.\\
244 - Need... or want?\\
245 - I'd say need, Hal. I really have to go to the bathroom.\\
246 - -I need to go. -Me, too.\\
247 - So this is something none of us feel we can overcome?\\
248 - This has us beat.\\
249 - Well, then, we can put our work here aside and all go to the bathroom.\\
250 - Only there's no bathroom in the car!\\
251 - Hey, Mom.\\
252 - Here's your lunch.\\
253 - Mm. Meatloaf Sandwich.\\
254 - Oh, morning, dear.\\
255 - Oh, honey, it feels so good to be helping people take control of their lives.\\
256 - Milton in Accounting called me from the Motel 6 this morning.\\
257 - He had to leave his wife and kids, but as soon as the Ice Capades reads his script, he's moving the whole family to New York.\\
258 - What are you doing?\\
259 - Oh, I keep trying and trying to get Jamie to use the potty, but he keeps refusing.\\
260 - Those stupid parenting books say to put stickers all over it, make it a happy place, so I figured why not?\\
261 - I obviously don't know anything about raising children.\\
262 - Damn it!\\
263 - What's wrong with these boys?\\
264 - Honey, let me handle this.\\
265 - You are a superstar! You're not afraid of this potty!\\
266 - This potty is afraid of you!\\
267 - You have to visualize your success!\\
268 - Now, let's look at the five lies you tell yourself that prevent you from being all that you can be!\\
269 - Oh, Hal!\\
270 - Reese, where have you been? Why weren't you in school today?\\
271 - A pack from another neighborhood was sniffing around, trying to move into our territory.\\
272 - Me and the boys had a score to settle.\\
273 - You were out fighting with dogs?\\
274 - What is wrong with you? Is that a bite mark on your leg?\\
275 - This little crazy guy went after Toffee,\\
276 - Oh, man! And then Chewy and Angel went down!\\
277 - So we brought down a couple of theirs! Tit for tat, baby!\\
278 - Oh, we're gonna settle this thing no matter what it costs!\\
279 - It's gonna go on and on until the bitter end!\\
280 - They need me.\\
281 - $120, $140, $160, $180.\\
282 - That'll have to do.\\
283 - I'm giving you a good deal, kid.\\
284 - I didn't get in this business so I could rip off little children.\\
285 - Hey, you need a gun?\\
286 - Let's hear from some more who aren't afraid!\\
287 - I'm gonna be a vice president in two years!\\
288 - Hey, come on, he knows!\\
289 - I'm gonna get out of debt!\\
290 - Hey, she knows!\\
291 - I'm gonna have sex with a member of every race!\\
292 - All right! All right!\\
293 - Now let's see who's next up.\\
294 - Gerry? Is there a Gerry Morrison in the house?\\
295 - Oh, Gerry, it says here that you turned down a promotion four times.\\
296 - Lady Luck smiles, but you give her the old stink eye. Gerry, what's going on?\\
297 - I guess I'm just frightened. I mean, I'm good at what I do now, and if I start trying\\
298 - to move up the ladder, I'll probably let everyone else down.\\
299 - Gerry, did you know that Michael Jordan didn't even see a basketball until he was 30 years old?\\
300 - No, no. I didn't know that.\\
301 - Who tied your tie this morning, Gerry?\\
302 - I did.\\
303 - Somebody just came in, pulled up your pants, shaved your face,\\
304 - combed back that lovely head of hair?\\
305 - No. I did it all myself.\\
306 - You did it all by yourself.\\
307 - You were in charge this morning, Gerry.\\
308 - But somehow when you walked out that door, you let the world take over.\\
309 - Why did you do that?\\
310 - I don't know.\\
311 - Well, I do know, Gerry.\\
312 - It's because you denied the giant that's inside you.\\
313 - You two. Get down on your hands and knees.\\
314 - I actually have a bad back.\\
315 - Is that your back talking, or your mind?\\
316 - -Actually, it's my doctor. -Or your doctor's mind?\\
317 - You tell your back it takes orders from you now.\\
318 - Climb on top, Gerry.\\
319 - What?\\
320 - Climb on top like the giant you are.\\
321 - Okay.\\
322 - I think my back is...\\
323 - A bridge of steel!\\
324 - How does it feel, Giant Gerry?\\
325 - Tall.\\
326 - Damn tall!\\
327 - All your life you've been letting people call the shots for you.\\
328 - Well, no more! Today is the day.\\
329 - You're a giant, Giant Gerry!\\
330 - The world looks better from up here.\\
331 - You bet it does!\\
332 - And that's where you live now.\\
333 - So what are you going to do, Giant Gerry?\\
334 - I'm gonna take that promotion!\\
335 - And I'm gonna become head of Systems Management!\\
336 - I-I'm in Systems Management.\\
337 - Damn right you are!\\
338 - And I'm gonna take you off these seminars and I'm gonna put you on my team full time.\\
339 - I'm gonna work that department,\\
340 - and I'm gonna work it until it's the strongest one in the whole company!\\
341 - And I'm gonna push my workers until they've given me everything that they've got.\\
342 - And then they can all say good-bye to their families\\
343 - 'cause I'm driving straight to the top!\\
344 - Man, that was amazing!\\
345 - They won't be leaving any more messages on our side of the park!\\
346 - Where we going now, Lucky, huh?\\
347 - Lucky, where you leading us?\\
348 - Really?\\
349 - You guys mean it?\\
350 - All right, I won't let you guys down.\\
351 - Let's roll!\\
352 - You found him in a chicken coop?!\\
353 - It's hard to know exactly what happened, ma'am.\\
354 - He and his friends appeared to have had themselves quite a little party.\\
355 - They just don't train ya to handle a scene like that.\\
356 - The law's a little murky in this area, but when we figure out how to charge him...\\
357 - I'll be back.\\
358 - I never thought about how it would end.\\
359 - It just felt so cool to belong.\\
360 - The important thing is you're out.\\
361 - But my boys...\\
362 - They rounded us all up\\
363 - and then these vets came in,\\
364 - and one by one...\\
365 - They killed them?\\
366 - No.\\
367 - But they're not my boys anymore.\\
368 - Mom...\\
369 - Dewey.\\
370 - I want to talk.\\
371 - I really don't feel up to that right now.\\
372 - I know I hurt you and I'm very sorry.\\
373 - Thank you, Dewey.\\
374 - But words are cheap.\\
375 - I wanted to do something that would show you I'm committed to this relationship.\\
376 - I want you to know how much you mean to me.\\
377 - I want you to know that no one can take your place.\\
378 - LOIS IS MY MOTHER I'm going back Tuesday.\\
379 - I passed out before they colored in the drop-shadow.\\
380 - It's not that I don't appreciate...\\
381 - We are going down to the hospital and you're gonna have that lasered off right this...\\
382 - Okay, I know you're trying to...\\
383 - But what is wrong with...?\\
384 - I never imagined you'd be willing to...\\
385 - But that is so stupid!\\
386 - Oh, look, they made a heart!

3 - So, there I was innocently paying the bills,\\
4 - when I was suddenly slapped in the face by a charge for $45.\\
5 - It took me almost an hour to sniff out your little rathole behind the refrigerator.\\
6 - Would you care to explain these?\\
7 - Hal, I'm sorry.\\
8 - Lois, we are poor!\\
9 - I thought we had an understanding.\\
10 - I know. You're right, Hal.\\
11 - I just saw them in the store. And they're not real Christian Louboutins. They're just a cheap knockoff.\\
12 - I just wanted to try them on, just for a second.\\
13 - Then I saw them in the mirror, and they looked so elegant and glamorous,\\
14 - and I guess I just wanted for once in my life to see what it would feel like to be...\\
15 - pretty.\\
16 - Oh, please, I invented that act!\\
17 - Everyone says they'll economize, but I'm the only one rinsing out baggies.\\
18 - I'm the only one splitting two-ply toilet paper. I'm the only one snacking out of birdfeeders!\\
19 - Look at this!\\
20 - $18 for a three-minute...\\
21 - What the...?!\\
22 - Welcome to the Hot Fantasy Sex Line.\\
23 - -What's your name, baby? -This is...\\
24 - Are you aware kids call these numbers?!\\
25 - Put some clothes on!\\
26 - Yeah, baby, would you like that?\\
27 - Oh, you just love not responding, don't you?\\
28 - You're such a bad boy.\\
29 - Well, big spender, I can keep going as long as you can.\\
30 - And that slapshot you took totally turned the game around!\\
31 - Well, I wasn't aiming right for his mouth, but sometimes you get lucky.\\
32 - You guys are not gonna believe what happened!\\
33 - I was at the college, checking out the trees over by the sorority houses,\\
34 - and then this guy comes up to me and asks if I wanted a job!\\
35 - Experimental drug testing?\\
36 - He must've thought I was in college because of my binoculars and everything.\\
37 - Can you believe it?\\
38 - They pay people just to take pills!\\
39 - Why is anyone doing anything else?\\
40 - Reese, this is the kind of job they give to guys on death row.\\
41 - Yeah, and I'm totally skipping that part.\\
42 - Jamie, get out of here. I have to...\\
43 - Francis, I am not going to ask you again!\\
44 - You tell me where you hid my pearl necklace!\\
45 - Somewhere you'll never find it!\\
46 - I have a hiding place so perfect, you could look for a hundred years and it won't matter!\\
47 - Your earrings, your necklace, your bracelet,\\
48 - all your meaningless material possessions you hold so dear, gone forever!\\
49 - Now I can go to military school knowing you're as miserable as I am,\\
50 - 'cause you'll never find it! Ever!\\
51 - The stash.\\
52 - Jamie, where did you...?\\
53 - The stash?! What about the stash?\\
54 - I didn't say anything about the stash.\\
55 - I think I heard you very clearly say "the stash."\\
56 - We don't talk about the stash unless we found the stash.\\
57 - I didn't find the stash!\\
58 - Okay, but I suggest you remember our deal.\\
59 - If any of us does find it, we split Mom's reward three ways.\\
60 - Because we're brothers and we love each other.\\
61 - Malcolm, come on! We're going to be late!\\
62 - All right, all right, I'm coming.\\
63 - Why aren't you wearing your smock?\\
64 - Because the longer I don't put it on,\\
65 - the longer I can pretend I don't work in that soul killing fluorescent tomb.\\
66 - As shocking as it may sound to you,\\
67 - I don't actually like stocking wart cream and telling 80-year-olds which diapers leak the least.\\
68 - "Thank you, Mother, for getting me a job so I don't have to be a bum on the street."\\
69 - "You're welcome."\\
70 - "Can I open the door for you, after everything you've sacrificed for me?"\\
71 - "Why, that's very thoughtful of you."\\
72 - You really got to stop being such a snob. There's pride in doing anything well.\\
73 - I'd rather you were the best toilet scrubber in the world than a slapdash Supreme Court justice.\\
74 - And how about showing me a little bit gratitude?\\
75 - There's nothing embarrassing about working at Lucky Aide.\\
76 - Listen to your mother.\\
77 - She's a beautiful, foxy lady.\\
78 - Okay, everything looks great.\\
79 - You're young. You're in excellent health. You're a perfect candidate for this study.\\
80 - Now, one last question: are you taking any other medications?\\
81 - Of course not.\\
82 - Of course not.\\
83 - Of course not.\\
84 - Of course not.\\
85 - Of course not.\\
86 - Billing. Can I help you?\\
87 - Yes! I've just spent the last half hour trying to explain to you people!\\
88 - You cannot charge me $800 for a phone call I never agreed to!\\
89 - This is wrong and unethical!\\
90 - You're absolutely right, sir.\\
91 - We're bad.\\
92 - What?\\
93 - We've been very bad. We need to be punished.\\
94 - What would you like to do to us?\\
95 - I don't want to do anything to you!\\
96 - Whatever you want, big boy. You're the one paying for this call.\\
97 - Malcolm!\\
98 - Malcolm!\\
99 - Did you hear the news?\\
100 - They fired Sam the stilt guy!\\
101 - Word is he puked into the sunroof of the boss's El Dorado.\\
102 - This is bad, Malcolm, really bad.\\
103 - Bad? He's been coming to work drunk for 20 years.\\
104 - I meant bad for me.\\
105 - This means they're paying attention!\\
106 - Sam was my canary.\\
107 - Now my work has to speak for itself!\\
108 - Don't say I never listen to you, Malcolm.\\
109 - I had to lobby hard for you, but...\\
110 - you're replacing Sam.\\
111 - It's 30 cents an hour more; you get to work outside and wave to all your friends.\\
112 - This is so sweet.\\
113 - I'm gonna make 2,500 bucks,\\
114 - and all I gotta do is swallow 300 pills a day\\
115 - and sneak Jamie's urine into a cup once in a while.\\
116 - Calonil, Frageset. Suppository.\\
117 - These taste the worst.\\
118 - Okay, Jamie, can you help your favorite brother find the stash?\\
119 - Remember this, the necklace?\\
120 - You know what I'm talking about, don't you?\\
121 - Do you know what I'm talking about?\\
122 - Oh, my God! Where did you...?!\\
123 - Can you show Dewey where you found this?\\
124 - Sure, you can.\\
125 - You show me where you found this, and we can write our ticket with Mom.\\
126 - We cut Malcolm and Reese out. It's just you and me.\\
127 - Is it in the bathroom?\\
128 - Mom's underwear drawer? Of course!\\
129 - She'd never think of looking for it there.\\
130 - There's probably a false bottom or something.\\
131 - What are you doing?!\\
132 - God, look at the dump this guy lives in.\\
133 - It's not bad enough I have to take his job.\\
134 - Now I have to take his stilts from him, too?\\
135 - Those stilts are company property, and it's our responsibility to get them back.\\
136 - It's nothing personal.\\
137 - Cough up the stilts, alkie!\\
138 - No, no! Please don't do this to me.\\
139 - I love my job!\\
140 - Malcolm, you gotta help me!\\
141 - Sam, I'm sorry. I feel really terrible about this.\\
142 - Don't drag this out, Malcolm. You got to crush him like a bug.\\
143 - It's kinder that way.\\
144 - You're a ghost, old man. No one can hear you.\\
145 - Malcolm, please!\\
146 - Just tell them you won't do it.\\
147 - Then they'll have no choice.\\
148 - They'll have to take me back!\\
149 - Please, I'm begging you.\\
150 - I'm Uncle Sam!\\
151 - Please! I have nothing else! No family, no friends!\\
152 - This is my life!\\
153 - Please!\\
154 - You want me to kiss your ass and call it ice cream?\\
155 - I'll do it! I'll do it!\\
156 - It's ice cream! That's delicious ice cream!\\
157 - You know who has delicious ice cream? That gas station down on Cedar.\\
158 - Smells a little funky, but mm-mm-mm.\\
159 - Malcolm, please!\\
160 - Please!\\
161 - Sam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
162 - No, no! No, no! Please!\\
163 - Okay, grab the suit and we'll get out of Sam's hair.\\
164 - Please!\\
165 - Sorry, Sam.\\
166 - Please!\\
167 - Sorry.\\
168 - No, Malcolm!\\

179 - Lucky Aide Bug Bombs only $2.49.\\

181 - Compared to now, that was a moment of pride and quiet dignity.\\
182 - Fourscore and seven\\
183 - stool softeners for the price of six.\\
184 - How you doing, honey?\\
185 - The manager says he hasn't heard you announce the Lucky Leader specials all morning.\\
186 - No one cares about the special, Mom.\\
187 - All right, if you want me to get up on a ladder and do it with you...\\
188 - It's a grand old sale It's a high-flying sale\\

195 - Hey! Where's the stopper for your pee hose?\\
196 - Hey, man, you don't look so good.\\
197 - You want to try some of these experimental drugs?\\
198 - What's all this stuff?\\
199 - I'm supposed to chart my progress in these journals.\\
200 - You know, blackouts, hallucinations, routine stuff.\\
201 - You're lactating?\\
202 - Not all the time.\\

205 - My hand isn't writing down what I tell it to anymore.\\
206 - I have to go shave my feet again.\\
207 - Jamie, where did you go? You were supposed to let me follow you!\\
208 - I just turned my back for a second.\\
209 - How did you do that?!\\
210 - Jamie, come on!\\
211 - Do you have any idea how much this means to me?\\
212 - Okay, what do you want?\\
213 - Okay, I'll get you the pony.\\
214 - But, first, you have to show me the stash.\\
215 - Fine. Pony first.\\
216 - Oh, Dewey.\\
217 - I need your help.\\
218 - You're always skulking around, listening in on everyone's conversations.\\
219 - Do you have any dirt on your mom? I need something really big and awful.\\
220 - I did something bad,\\
221 - so I have to find something that she did bad,\\
222 - then I can confess what I did, and it won't seem like such a big deal.\\
223 - Sorry, Dad, but I don't just stash away information...\\
224 - Stash? You found the stash?\\
225 - You and me partners. We cut everyone else out.\\
226 - No! No! I didn't find the stash!\\
227 - Okay, okay. Are you sure she's not having an affair?\\
228 - Because that would be perfect.\\
229 - Sorry, Dad. I think she loves you.\\
230 - Damn!\\
231 - If I can't do the "You did bad, I did bad" thing,\\
232 - then I gotta do the "I did bad, you'll get a big, expensive present" thing.\\
233 - Never get married, Dewey. If you want kids, get your eggs from the state.\\
234 - Mom, what are you doing? I was in the middle of a game!\\
235 - Do you want to explain why I found circled want ads sticking out of your backpack?!\\
236 - -Yes, I do. -I'm not interested!\\
237 - You are not finding another job!\\
238 - Huh?\\
239 - No! I...\\
240 - You are not getting a job away from my constant supervision, and that's it.\\
241 - I'm not going to risk your future by giving you even a second of freedom!\\
242 - This family has too much invested in you.\\
243 - Oh, cheer up.\\
244 - Once I find a proper wife for you, you'll have your precious space.\\
245 - Hi. Yes. Do you have a pair of Christian Louboutins red open-toed sling-backs, size 8 ?\\
246 - Not the knockoffs, the real thing.\\
247 - You do?!\\
248 - Good!\\
249 - Now, I'm in a situation where money is no object, but how much...?\\
250 - Would you put a pair aside for me, please?\\
251 - Right. Yes. They will make a nice surprise.\\
252 - Hello?\\
253 - Reese?\\
254 - Francis, you gotta help me.\\
255 - I don't want to take drugs anymore.\\
256 - Oh, geez.\\
257 - Okay, Reese, I want you to tell me very specifically what kind of drugs did you take?\\
258 - All of them.\\
259 - Dude, didn't you learn anything from when my friends baby-sat you?\\
260 - Remember Richie trying to dry you off in the oven?\\
261 - I don't know how it happened, but I think I did something bad.\\
262 - I don't know what to do.\\
263 - Reese, I want you to listen very carefully.\\
264 - You're going to be okay. I'm gonna talk you through this.\\
265 - Now, the first and most important thing\\
266 - you have to do is...\\
267 - Okay, Jamie, I need you to focus.\\
268 - You got your toy.\\
269 - Now take me to the stash.\\
270 - Here?\\
271 - Do we have to dig for it?\\
272 - Jamie, come back!\\
273 - You can't just go into someone else's house!\\
274 - Get back here!\\
275 - Come on, Jamie! Hurry! Before someone sees you!\\
276 - I'm not kidding. You're going to get caught!\\
277 - See? That's the ringleader!\\
278 - They've been stealing stuff from my house all week!\\
279 - Every two years, they have another baby just so they can fit through the window!\\
280 - Hal? What are you doing here? Is everything all right?\\
281 - Not yet, but it will be...\\
282 - as soon as you put these on.\\
283 - Are you crazy?\\
284 - If loving your wife is crazy, then I'm a drooling lunatic.\\
285 - You deserve the moon and the sky, Lois.\\
286 - Maybe someday I'll be able to buy them for you, but for now,\\
287 - these will have to do.\\
288 - Oh, Hal.\\
289 - Thank you.\\
290 - I accidentally spent $800 on phone sex.\\
291 - I was doing my makeup in the rear view mirror, and I ran over your golf clubs.\\
292 - I burned a hole in your favorite dress.\\
293 - You didn't get that promotion because I called your boss a fat-ass at the Christmas party.\\
294 - I lost my wedding ring three years ago. This is part of a lawnmower.\\
295 - Your Aunt Lucy isn't angry with you. She's dead. I just forgot to tell you.\\
296 - I've read that the Chinese invented stils so they could survive among Panda bears.\\
297 - Of course, that was before they built the Great Wall.\\
298 - After that, only the Emperor was allowed to walk on them.\\
299 - Well, I had to do it behind Mom's back,\\
300 - but I was going through the want ads, and I finally found...\\
301 - That explains the 15-foot high cloud of bourbon I was smelling.\\
302 - You stole my life!\\
303 - Sam, great! I-I was just about to call...\\
304 - Oh, my God! Don't worry, Malcolm.\\
305 - I'll help you!\\
306 - Sam, you've got to listen to me!\\
307 - Hang on!\\
308 - Damn it!\\
309 - What aisle are the screwdrivers in?\\
310 - Wich batteries are the double A?\\
311 - The little ones, or the really little ones?\\
312 - Sam, please listen...\\
313 - I'm never gonna shake this guy.\\
314 - He's way too good.\\
315 - I can't outstilt him.\\
316 - I can't outstilt him, but I can outskate him.\\
317 - Okay, your brother got the funeral he wanted. Now let's get our $15 back.\\
318 - Once again, brains triumph over...\\
319 - This hurts so much worse than it looks.\\
320 - You're a Yankee Doodle dead man.\\
321 - The weird thing is, I always knew I'll died this way.\\
322 - Okay, God, you've had your fun.\\
323 - Please, I'll settle for the lamest, most pathetic miracle you've got lying around.\\
324 - Just...\\
325 - Well, I purposely dropped that bowling ball on your foot\\
326 - so you couldn't go to your high school reunion!\\
327 - I'm two years older than you think I am!\\
328 - Damn it, Hal, we're to point here I don't think either one of us wants to get to!\\
329 - What are we supposed to do?!\\
330 - I've just got so much rage built up...\\
331 - Are these your boys?\\
332 - You little monsters!\\
333 - How dare you get into trouble again?! After all your mother does for you!\\
334 - Your father slaves away to put a roof over your head, and this is how you repay him?!\\
335 - Okay, everybody, let's just calm down...\\
336 - Why don't you mind your own business?\\
337 - We don't need you coming in here and telling us how to handle our children.\\
338 - We know what we're doing. Thank you very much.\\
339 - Mom, Dad, the drugs are weared off.\\
340 - Sundance, baby, is that you?\\
341 - Will you listen to me?!\\
342 - I found you a job!\\
343 - What?\\
344 - I found you a job! I've been trying to tell you.\\
345 - It's perfect for you!\\
346 - It's at the circus!\\
347 - The circus?\\
348 - In what world do you depreciate an elephant over two years?!\\
349 - I want this all redone tonight!\\
350 - What are you looking at? Get back to work!\\
351 - That is fantastic son!\\
352 - Reese's roommate in detox is a lawyer.\\
353 - He thinks he can blackmail him into defending his felony case!\\
354 - That's great.\\
355 - Hey, the feeling is back.\\
356 - Apparently, the medical term for what happened to me is "Holy crap, come look at this".\\
357 - because that's all the ER guys kept saying.\\
358 - But if I ever have to give birth, it'll be really easy.\\
359 - And Mom seems to be in a good mood lately.\\
360 - The toilet's backed up again!\\
361 - I'll get it.
\subsection {Episode 21: Buseys Takes A Hostage}
1 - So, if Rex Huntington is the finest doctor in Spring Valley,\\
2 - why is he defending Jessica in the murder trial.\\
3 - Because, before he got pushed off that mountain and got amnesia,\\
4 - he was the finest lawyer in Spring Valley.\\
5 - What I can't believe is Jessica is having an affair with the judge.\\
6 - I mean, he's totally using her to get his hands on the Farnsworth fortune.\\
7 - You can't ground me!\\
8 - That fire could have been started by anybody!\\
9 - Why don't you ever take my side?! You never listen anything I say!\\
10 - You know, Reese, some very manly men watch soap operas with their mothers.\\

14 - If you are diligent in your efforts, you will find that our spring project\\
15 - will develop your fine motor skills and powers of concentration.\\
16 - Also, it will teach you a vocation that may, one day, lead you a life of semi-independence.\\
17 - Hello, class.\\
18 - Hello, Principal Jeffers.\\
19 - You've come at a very exciting time.\\
20 - We're about to open a new box of key clips.\\
21 - And how are we all today, students?\\
22 - I know no one gives a crap about the kids in this class,\\
23 - but could you get us some books so we could actually learn something?\\
24 - The only thing we've done here for the last ten weeks is make lanyards!\\
25 - You know what subject I hated most when I was a kid? Math.\\
26 - Dewey, I need you to re-sort my pills again.\\
27 - I just finished sorting them. It took me a half hour.\\
28 - I know. But then I unsorted them so I could see if I could sort them by myself.\\
29 - I can't.\\
30 - All right. Just don't touch them anymore.\\
31 - I'll do it with you after school.\\
32 - Dewey, I need your help after school.\\
33 - I'm already helping Hanson.\\
34 - But I need you!\\
35 - The sidewalks told me they wouldn't let me walk home anymore.\\
36 - Can you...?\\
37 - Okay, just wait till I'm done, then I'll walk you home.\\
38 - But, seriously, you guys have to start trying to do a little more for yourselves.\\
39 - Oh, that reminds me. My uncle died,\\
40 - and my parents were wondering if you'd explain death to me.\\
41 - Are you studying?\\
42 - Yeah. My stupid teachers wait until the end of my senior year to tell me I have final exams.\\
43 - In every single class!\\
44 - I've got to get serious now.\\
45 - If the finals are anything like this practice test, it's gonna be brutal.\\
46 - It's just a bunch of true/false questions.\\
47 - So it's a 50-50 chance.\\
48 - Do you know what the odds are of getting one of those right?\\
49 - $23 for the neighborhood association.\\
50 - The annual meeting is tomorrow night.\\
51 - It's been a year already? Those people are relentless.\\
52 - You think, if we showed up once, they'd stop inviting us?\\
53 - -That's always been the pattern. -Hal, don't worry. You have a good excuse.\\
54 - Tomorrow you're cleaning the dead possum out of the chimney.\\
55 - The smell has gotten so bad, I can't tell when Jamie needs changing anymore.\\
56 - You know, if we just wait a few more weeks, it'll disintegrate on its own.\\
57 - Tomorrow, Hal.\\
58 - I'm sick of all those crows on roof.\\
59 - Hey, Dad.\\
60 - What? Wait. You think patriotism is a joke?!\\
61 - Representative government is an outdated sham? I can't believe my ears!\\
62 - What are you talking about?\\
63 - What did he say?\\
64 - I can't even repeat it. I'm sorry, Lois, but the chimney will just have to wait.\\
65 - I'm taking Malcolm to the neighborhood association meeting.\\
66 - Let's hope seeing democracy in action will give our little cynic a wake-up call.\\
67 - Chad, I have to finish correcting everyone's homework.\\
68 - It's been in your mouth a half an hour. Either spit it out or swallow it.\\
69 - Dewey?\\
70 - Oh, hey, Francis.\\
71 - You want to talk to Mom?\\
72 - No. I called to talk to you.\\
73 - Me? Really?\\
74 - Yeah. Listen. I'm up for a job as activities director at a summer camp,\\
75 - but I have to show them what kind of program I can put together.\\
76 - I need you to help me.\\
77 - -You want my help? -Yeah.\\
78 - I have all these great ideas for games, so I'm gonna come home tomorrow so I can play them with you.\\
79 - You know, to make sure they're fun enough.\\
80 - So how does that sound?\\
81 - Like a setup for a cruel practical joke, but I'm willing to take the risk.\\
82 - Excuse me.\\
83 - We're here for the homeowners meeting.\\
84 - Oh, my God! Really?\\
85 - Oh, that's fantastic!\\
86 - Jim Phipps.\\
87 - I'm the association's attorney.\\
88 - So... where is everyone?\\
89 - Well, I kind of am everyone.\\
90 - No one's ever shown up for a homeowners meeting in 20 years.\\
91 - You're kidding. Not one person?\\
92 - Not one... not one...\\
93 - I send out 150 flyers every year, exactly as mandated by the developer, but nobody ever comes.\\
94 - I've tried different fonts, I've upgraded the doughnuts,\\
95 - but people just don't seem to be interested.\\
96 - So, every year, you rent a room, and hold a meeting for nobody?\\
97 - Absolutely.\\
98 - My contract with the developer is very clear.\\
99 - In exchange for a $2,000 annual retainer, I'm to conduct annual meetings,\\
100 - take the minutes, and manage the association's financial interests.\\
101 - Financial interest?\\
102 - Well, actually, there aren't any. I didn't mean to come off so self-important.\\
103 - Only the homeowners can decide where the money goes, so I've just been putting the dues in a savings account.\\
104 - The bank gave me a toaster in 1987. I never even opened the box.\\
105 - So, 150 homes paying 23 bucks over 20 years, passbook interest, minus the retainer...\\
106 - Oh, my God! If my math is right, he's sitting on at least $83,000!\\
107 - Who am I kidding? Of course my math is right.\\
108 - You know, it sure would be nice to have someone finally take charge of this thing.\\
109 - Would you ever consider being president of the neighborhood association?\\
110 - I don't think so. It sounds like... work.\\
111 - Dad, what are you talking about?\\
112 - Of course you want to be president!\\
113 - This is your chance to really do something for the community.\\
114 - -I don't think... -You can't turn this down.\\
115 - You've always told me that a real citizen is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.\\
116 - -This doesn't sound like... -And I took those words to heart!\\
117 - They inspired me.\\
118 - And now I have a chance to see my own dad show me what democracy is all about.\\
119 - You can't deny me that.\\
120 - -Well... -It's not just for me.\\
121 - It's for our family, our block, the whole neighborhood!\\
122 - Think of all the people you could help.\\
123 - The world is waiting for you to make it a better place!\\
124 - Well... Okay. I'll do it.\\
125 - Finally!\\
126 - This is exactly the reason I went into zoning law.\\
127 - I don't see how this helps.\\
128 - Where's Dewey?\\
129 - When I was his age, I was out of school hours ago.\\
130 - Doing independent study...\\
131 - at the library...\\
132 - not smoking.\\
133 - So, it's exciting about the job.\\
134 - Yeah. It's been a long hunt, but it finally paid off.\\
135 - Don't you have to have some kind of degree or something to work with children?\\
136 - You never think anything I ever do is good enough!\\
137 - I happened to do very well at that interview.\\
138 - All I have to do now is just show them that I can put together a good program for the summer.\\
139 - So you don't have the job.\\
140 - I have the job! What don't you understand about that?!\\
141 - I don't know. It just sounds like the real estate thing all over again.\\
142 - Why can't you just have faith in me for once?!\\
143 - Gin. Want to play again?\\
144 - Sure.\\
145 - -You know who's hiring? -I have a job!\\
146 - I am appalled.\\
147 - This completion stitch is kinked.\\
148 - Young lady, if you neglect your education, you deny yourself the keys to success.\\
149 - Dewey, wait!\\
150 - I can't. I have to get home to see my brother.\\
151 - But I need you to help me with the algebra problems you gave me.\\
152 - I went over those problems 20 times!\\
153 - But my head passhrough a magnet, and I think I forgot everything.\\
154 - I'm sorry! I can't!\\
155 - I can't do this anymore.\\
156 - I'm sorry.\\
157 - It's okay, Dewey. We understand.\\
158 - Yeah.\\
159 - Go have fun with your brother. We'll be fine.\\
160 - Everyone turn in their assignments.\\
161 - I have to take this one home with me. It doesn't believe that I have a cat.\\
162 - It's 3:00. It is now time to clear your area!\\
163 - I don't think you want to do anything physical with Chad.\\
164 - Don't test me, young man.\\
165 - I am an educator who is not afraid to use discipline.\\
166 - All right.\\
167 - Now it's a matter for the police.\\
168 - Dewey! What do we do?\\
169 - He's not here.\\
170 - Somebody do something!\\
171 - Excuse me, Mr. Flerch?\\
172 - Well I think of the three ideas we had,\\
173 - this was the best.\\
174 - I win!\\
175 - Good job.\\
176 - Okay, Dewey, of all the things we did today, what seemed like it could be more fun?\\
177 - The rainbow acle course or the tickle maze or the shower of lollipops?\\
178 - I have to tell it was all fantastic.\\
179 - It was by far the best day of my life.\\
180 - I can make you happier.\\
181 - "President, comma, Newcastle Adjacent Neighborhood Association."\\
182 - Hal, that is so fancy.\\
183 - Feel the little duck. That's embossed.\\
184 - So. How's my little bureaucrat?\\
185 - Fantastic.\\
186 - I'm just finishing up the details in all the neighborhood initiatives you've been talking about.\\
187 - I was?\\
188 - Yeah. Remember you said, "I hope I do a good job"?\\
189 - Obviously that mean structural improvements:\\
190 - like installing lights at the basketball court and building a skate park...\\
191 - and Friday night dance parties with a killer DJ.\\
192 - Isn't that kind expensive?\\
193 - You have to think of it as an investment.\\
194 - It's actually expensive not to do it.\\
195 - There's $87,000 in the account?\\
196 - Well, a lot of it gets eaten up servicing the infrastructure.\\
197 - Like, there's no point in having a DJ if you're not going to have a really rock sound system.\\
198 - Why are we just give the homeowners a refund check?\\
199 - We could.\\
200 - But we wouldn't have the money for what you said was the most important thing... security.\\
201 - Security is big.\\
202 - I've been racking my brain, trying find a way to give every area equal protection.\\
203 - I wish there was some magic kind of mobile security system that could weave through the neighborhood.\\
204 - Like a security car?\\
205 - Dad that's brilliant!\\
206 - And then citizens from the neighborhood could drive a car out to make sure there's no trouble.\\
207 - I don't know.\\
208 - Purchasing a car isn't the only expense. You got to think about storage fees...\\
209 - Wait, we could park it at our house.\\
210 - You have a real talent for this.\\
211 - Hey, it's almost lunchtime.\\
212 - Where's Flerch?\\
213 - I don't know.\\
214 - You'd think he'd be here by now, but he definitely isn't.\\
215 - I know. I'm so fed up, I don't even think it's worse complaining about.\\
216 - Listen, guys, I'm sorry I blew up be here yesterday.\\
217 - I guess I just kind needed a break.\\
218 - Forget it Dewey.\\
219 - We need start doing things on our own.\\
220 - And you know what?\\
221 - I think we're already doing things we didn't think we were capable of.\\
222 - 3,081.\\
223 - Did you pull all night?\\
224 - Yeah. Math. I kept getting confused, so I'm making a list of all the numbers\\
225 - 3,082.\\
226 - Where do they stop?\\
227 - The state-of-the-art rehearsal studio is essentially free,\\
228 - because once the garage band makes it big, the community gets ten percent of the record sales.\\
229 - So it's basically the same business model as the extreme sport camp.\\
230 - So, did you get a chance to go through my proposal for a girls' volleyball tournament?\\
231 - Well...\\
232 - -Jim, what are you doing here? -I had to share this with you.\\
233 - What is it?\\
234 - I was so inspired by what your son said,\\
235 - that I went beyond the requirements of my retainer and wrote a new constitution for the Neighborhood Association.\\
236 - Pro bono of course.\\
237 - It's designed, so that everyone in a comunity will have an equal voice in all decisions. I think it'll really get people participating.\\
238 - That sounds great, Jim. Thanks.\\
239 - No, thank you for showing up at that meeting and making me belive again.\\
240 - What a jerk.\\
241 - What? Why?\\
242 - Coming in here with his agenda like you are not doing fantastic job when you are.\\
243 - I think he just want the voice of the people to be heard.\\
244 - You are the voice of the people.\\
245 - You are the one with the vision.\\
246 - You are the one with the amazing ideas topping out of you every second.\\
247 - - Maybe not every second. - Yes.\\
248 - Your brain is a factory of ideas.\\
249 - Please do not close the factory.\\
250 - You know, sometimes it's feels like a factory.\\
251 - Of course it does. You are the leader of this community.\\
252 - Everybody recognizes it and they love for it.\\
253 - Well don't worry son,\\
254 - I won't let the people down.\\
255 - Okay, Dewey, I've got a pretty good handle on these games, I just want ask you some questions.\\
256 - Okay.\\
257 - When I was cheering encouragement at you, did it ever make you feel scared or angry?\\
258 - What? No.\\
259 - Good.\\
260 - And when you lost the candy tag, did it make you feel bad and want to hurt yourself?\\
261 - What do you talking about Francis? This questions are weird.\\
262 - I'm just try understand better, Dewey.\\
263 - I mean, I don't know all the right questions ask kids like you.\\
264 - What you mean "kids like me"?\\
265 - Well, you're in that class.\\
266 - And this is a special camp for children with your...\\
267 - needs.\\
268 - I'm not emotionally disturbed, what the hell is wrong with you?\\
269 - There's nothing wrong with either of us.\\
270 - I'm not in that class because I'm disturbed! I'm in that class so I can help...\\
271 - You're a jerk!\\
272 - Okay, my games obviously have too much sugar.\\
273 - Is everything okay?\\
274 - Yeah.\\
275 - This is my favorite time of day.\\
276 - The sun's about to come up and my mean voice is still asleep.\\
277 - I hate walking to school in the dark.\\
278 - I have to run past people's houses so I don't catch their nightmares.\\
279 - We have to tell Dewey about this.\\
280 - No. This is exactly the kind of thing he doesn't want to be bothered with.\\
281 - We can't handle taking care of Flerch!\\
282 - If he dies, we're gonna have to tell everybody!\\
283 - Are you saying I'm not doing a good job feeding him?\\
284 - I chewed his steak for 20 minutes before I gave it to him!\\
285 - Oh, help me! It's my heart, weakened as it was by a childhood ailment!\\
286 - He's dying! I totally called this!\\
287 - Give him CPR!\\
288 - - I-I'm not strong enough! - We have to keep his heart pumping.\\
289 - Use your legs! Chad, help him breathe.\\
290 - One, two, three, breathe!\\
291 - One, two, three, breathe!\\
292 - One, two, three, breathe!\\
293 - One, two, three, breathe!\\
294 - Wait.\\
295 - I saw this thing on TV once where they helped a guy breathe\\
296 - by cutting a hole in his throat and jamming a pen in it!\\
297 - I've got a pen!\\
298 - Somebody get scissors!\\
299 - Eddie, for God sake, help me!\\
300 - They're gonna kill me!\\
301 - I'm sorry I assumed you could break-dance! I'm actually one-sixteenth Cherokee myself!\\
302 - Dad, you okay?\\
303 - Malcolm, I couldn't sleep.\\
304 - My mind has been on fire with the possibilities of what this neighborhood could become.\\
305 - At first it seemed crazy and kind of stupid,\\
306 - but then I remembered what you said about the factory!\\
307 - In the middle of the night I had a vision.\\
308 - You had a vision without me?\\
309 - - "Mulberry Village"? - Mulberry Village.\\
310 - A new utopia!\\
311 - What the hell is all this stuff?\\
312 - Just a few compulsory guidelines to help people make the transition.\\
313 - "Failure to smile 'Hello,' $50 fine?\\
314 - Not knowing your neighbor's name: $25?\\
315 - Failure to remove your fence: $100?"\\
316 - People can be resistant to change.\\
317 - - What's the "Hug your child" initiative? - Everyone has to publicly hug their child at least once a day.\\
318 - A hotline will be set up so that children can inform on non-hugging parents.\\
319 - You're going to make kids inform on their parents?\\
320 - Parents, neighbors, teachers, everybody! If they've got nothing to hide, they've got nothing to worry about.\\
321 - Tell me about the "reeducation center."\\
322 - Oh! That's where the best, most neighborly children will be plucked from the corrupting influence of their families,\\
323 - and immersed in round-the-clock friendliness training.\\
324 - I call them the Mulberry Youth.\\
325 - Dad...\\
326 - give me the fliers.\\
327 - Thank you, son, but they've already been distributed throughout the whole neighborhood.\\
328 - Like a modern-day Martin Luther, I nailed them to the front doors.\\
329 - Maybe we should go out the back door and spend the rest of the day at the library.\\
330 - Not now, Malcolm. The villagers are coming.\\
331 - Look, I told you, leave me alone.\\
332 - I'm just going to ask your teacher if I can have ten minutes with your buddies at recess.\\
333 - What the hell happened?!\\
334 - Isn't it obvious?\\
335 - I know we're not supposed to ask for help, Dewey, but...\\
336 - this one kind of got away from us.\\
337 - We gotta get out of here. Let's go call the police.\\
338 - You're just gonna bail?\\
339 - You don't understand these kids.\\
340 - If I fix this problem, there's going to be a hundred more.\\
341 - It never stops with them!\\
342 - Dewey...\\
343 - you don't get to choose the people who need your help.\\
344 - Look, I don't know much, but I do know two things.\\
345 - These kids need your help, you gotta do it.\\
346 - And even though I've never met him, that guy is a total dink.\\
347 - I thought when I decided to help, something would come to me, but I'm completely blank.\\
348 - You're all going to jail.\\
349 - If you untie me in the next five seconds, you and you alone will see some slight leniency.\\
350 - Lanyards belong in the lanyard box.\\
351 - What?\\
352 - That's my lanyard. I made it.\\
353 - Mr. Flerch is going to flip out if you don't put it back in the lanyard box.\\
354 - You couldn't have made this.\\
355 - I bought it at a truck stop 200 miles from here.\\
356 - Can I see that, Francis?\\
357 - Can you think of any connection between the thousands of lanyards\\
358 - that were made by the emotionally disturbed children at your school,\\
359 - and this one my brother found for sale at a retail outlet?\\
360 - Mr. Jeffers, I would be horrified to think that a public school principal\\
361 - would use innocent children as slave labor.\\
362 - I don't know what you're talking about, young man.\\
363 - It was all his idea!\\
364 - I'm just his obedient stooge!\\
365 - He dangled Assistant Vice Principal in front of me!\\
366 - It came with parking!\\
367 - I wonder who would get the worst penalty.\\
368 - A bunch of emotionally disturbed kids who tied people up for a little while...\\
369 - or the trusted public servant who forced them into slavery?\\
370 - We could ask a judge, or everyone could just keep quiet about everything.\\
371 - Sound okay to you guys?\\
372 - That depends.\\
373 - Can we get five minutes alone with these guys before you untie them?\\
374 - -What's up with Mom? -She just saw my report card.\\
375 - I flunked out of every single class.\\
376 - What?\\
377 - Every single one of my finals, I got every question wrong.\\
378 - Oh, my God.\\
379 - I know. Now I get to repeat my senior year!\\
380 - Isn't this great?\\
381 - I worked so hard for this.\\
382 - I had to make sure I flunked every class so completely, I couldn't make it up in summer school.\\
383 - Now I don't have to move out or go to college or get a job for a whole 'nother year!\\
384 - This is the greatest achievement of my entire life!\\
385 - Yeah, I know, Mom.
\subsection {Episode 22: Mrs. Tri-County}
1 - Oh, geez...\\
2 - Hey, can one of you boys give me a hand?\\
3 - What do you need?\\
4 - Just hold this steady.\\
5 - Thanks, Malcolm.\\
6 - I'm glad it's you.\\
7 - Whenever Reese helps, he always seems to hurt himself.\\
8 - Malcolm in the Middle - 6.22 - Mrs. Tri-County Synchronisation par Dingo & Tyno, Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com\\
9 - Wait, wait, how about this?\\
10 - "Mother's wonderful, quiet dignity."\\
11 - No, her "sensitive, quiet dignity."\\
12 - What are you guys doing?\\
13 - We were at the mall and they had these entry forms\\
14 - for the Mrs. Tri-County contest.\\
15 - Look at these questions.\\
16 - "How does your mother bring joy into your life?"\\
17 - How about the time she shaved the word "liar" into my head?\\
18 - "She always finds time to dote on our personal appearance."\\
19 - What's so funny?\\
20 - Reese saw a Japanese guy on the Internet puke into an electric fan.\\
21 - They are ahead of us in so many ways.\\
22 - All right, how bad is it?\\
23 - Nothing past second notice so far.\\
24 - What's that?\\
25 - Apparently I've been entered into the Mrs. Tri-County Pageant.\\
26 - What?\\
27 - The boys entered me in this pageant.\\
28 - "...lucky to have her in our lives."\\
29 - "Too special to be kept a secret..."\\
30 - "She suffers in silence..."?\\
31 - Oh, can you believe this?\\
32 - I know. They do all these horrible things\\
33 - and then they go and do something like this.\\
34 - Yes, well, they're good boys.\\
35 - God, I think of suffering through all those pageants\\
36 - slaving for my sister all those years.\\
37 - Susan was always the big star,\\
38 - and I was her invisible little troll.\\
39 - Carrying her gowns for Queen of Harvest Festival,\\
40 - ironing her sash for Miss Mammogram.\\
41 - Well, no one ever appreciates the star maker, Lois.\\
42 - Once I was hemming her dress for Dairy Princess\\
43 - and a photographer stood on my back to take her picture.\\
44 - Bastards wouldn't know a Dairy Princess\\
45 - if it came up and bit them on the ass.\\
46 - Boy, it would really show her if I entered this pageant.\\
47 - What?\\
48 - Well, it wouldn't hurt to go down there and see what it's all about.\\
49 - Great. Let's do it.\\
50 - You little monsters!\\
51 - You have really done it this time!\\
52 - Dad, it was a joke.\\
53 - I didn't know Reese was going to mail the stupid thing.\\
54 - We were just goofing around.\\
55 - I can't believe she took it seriously.\\
56 - You're right, Dewey.\\
57 - Your mother actually believes her sons love her.\\
58 - What a moron.\\
59 - I've got it.\\
60 - Why don't you just blindfold your mother and throw her down some stairs?!\\
61 - That'd be fun!\\
62 - -We're sorry. -Yeah.\\
63 - Well, it's too late for sorry.\\
64 - Here's what's going to happen.\\
65 - We are all going down to the Civic Center as a family,\\
66 - and you boys are going to do everything in your power\\
67 - to make sure this is the most unhumiliating night\\
68 - of your mother's life.\\
69 - This is a big deal.\\
70 - I have to be honest, I'm feeling kind of nervous here.\\
71 - You don't pay mileage, I had to park in the structure,\\
72 - and you call this a gift bag?\\
73 - I saw two judges with the mini-lipstick set\\
74 - and the lemon scented moisturizer.\\
75 - Mr. Herkabe, what are you doing here?\\
76 - I happen to be one of the judges.\\
77 - What, may I ask, are you doing here?\\
78 - You know, curiosity.\\
79 - It's kind of a sociologically interesting...\\
80 - My God, your mother's in the pageant.\\
81 - Well, technically.\\
82 - And I happen to have certain powers\\
83 - that might influence that outcome.\\
84 - Isn't that interesting?\\
85 - What?\\
86 - I just think that's really interesting.\\
87 - Don't you find it interesting?\\
88 - Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to.\\
89 - I'm sorry, sir.\\
90 - They were out of the moisturizer, but I found these.\\
91 - Fine. I'll take the smoked almonds, the loofah glove...\\
92 - Oh, just give me the whole box.\\
93 - All right, ladies, sign in.\\
94 - You'll get your schedules, your parking permits,\\
95 - and your dressing area assignments.\\
96 - Also, make sure that you get back here by 3:00 sharp\\
97 - for a group photo with the state's largest pumpkin.\\
98 - Look at all these old broads trying to look hot.\\
99 - I mean, don't know they know we're done with them?\\
100 - Donna? Donna, is that you?\\
101 - Lois!\\
102 - I haven't seen you since Miss Teen Gas and Power.\\
103 - What a memory you have.\\
104 - Was that the time when the judges\\
105 - carried me around on their shoulders?\\
106 - Darlene, Jeanie, Anne.\\
107 - Look who's here.\\
108 - Look at all of you.\\
109 - I can't believe you're still doing pageants.\\
110 - Well, I actually quit a few years back.\\
111 - It was time to get to know my kids a little better.\\
112 - But then September 11th happened, and...\\
113 - We just can't let them win.\\
114 - So where's your sister?\\
115 - Susan isn't here.\\
116 - I'm entering this myself.\\
117 - I love stuff like that.\\
118 - Don't feel bad.\\
119 - The rest of us don't have a chance either.\\
120 - Donna somehow got Nina Perucci to coach her.\\
121 - Nina Perucci.\\
122 - How did you manage that?\\
123 - Well, Max got a nice bonus for Christmas,\\
124 - and let's just say I had\\
125 - a yeast infection until he wrote the check.\\
126 - Is that your chin?\\
127 - No, Nina.\\
128 - Is that your smile?\\
129 - No, Nina.\\
130 - Is that your bust?\\
131 - No, Nina.\\
132 - She's amazing.\\
133 - She pioneered the use of backstage laxatives.\\
134 - Lois, if we don't sign up right now,\\
135 - we're going to get a dressing area without a hook.\\
136 - Is that what you want?\\
137 - Bye.\\
138 - Well, I think we know who's winning Mrs. Deluded.\\
139 - Donna...\\
140 - I didn't think it was possible, but the Mrs.\\
141 - Tri-County Pageant is about to get even uglier.\\
142 - I made the appointment for your facial tomorrow.\\
143 - I don't want to pick out jewelry\\
144 - until after we choose the gown.\\
145 - Now, the red one is nice, it's tasteful and really sets off your hair.\\
146 - But the blue one has a nicer drape\\
147 - and you cannot beat its "wow" factor.\\
148 - You know what?\\
149 - Let me worry about that.\\
150 - You can concentrate on your talent.\\
151 - I don't know, Hal.\\
152 - I'm not even sure you can call it a talent.\\
153 - What are you talking about?\\
154 - It is going to be great.\\
155 - That's why I blocked out the next three hours for you to work with Dewey.\\
156 - Dad, I have homework.\\
157 - Oh, just buy it from the guy Reese buys his from.\\
158 - Okay, ladies, I know you've all done it\\
159 - a million times before, but let's just walk through it once anyway.\\
160 - Blue line ladies, cross over the red mark.\\
161 - Green line, cross over the yellow mark.\\
162 - Blue line, stop at the orange mark,\\
163 - step left and cross to the green line.\\
164 - Green line, stop to the black mark,\\
165 - step right and cross to the...\\
166 - green line.\\
167 - Malcolm, I need you to do a job for me.\\
168 - It's urgent.\\
169 - I've been exchanging some very meaningful glances with one of the contestants.\\
170 - You know they're all married, don't you?\\
171 - Yes, of course.\\
172 - And that's why it would be indecent of me not to be discrete.\\
173 - Darlene Fisher.\\
174 - Green sweat suit.\\
175 - I need you to pass her this note for me.\\
176 - You want me to find out if she likes you?\\
177 - Forget it.\\
178 - I respect your stand,\\
179 - Malcolm, and I want you to know\\
180 - this will in no way affect my judging of your mother.\\
181 - Or will it?\\
182 - Okay, you're next.\\
183 - Now, no matter what question they ask you,\\
184 - remember to use your key phrases:\\
185 - "empowering women, the beauty within, helping those in need."\\
186 - And don't forget, end with "May God bless America."\\
187 - Right, right, and when do I say the stuff about world peace?\\
188 - No, no, no, no, no,\\
189 - we got rid of that.\\
190 - You don't want to come off like a liberal nut case.\\
191 - Yes, I am a mother, but I also have to remember that I'm a woman.\\
192 - A woman who's not afraid to give because it feels so good.\\
193 - Thank you.\\
194 - Okay, Lois...\\
195 - here's your question if you're ready.\\
196 - "How has motherhood kept you young?"\\
197 - I'm sorry, but I have a problem with the question.\\
198 - Motherhood definitely does a lot of things,\\
199 - but the one thing it does not do is keep you young.\\
200 - Oh, my God,\\
201 - it ages you horribly.\\
202 - Youth is about having choices, but once you're a mother, you have no choices.\\
203 - You're stuck loving your children.\\
204 - You get gray hair loving them.\\
205 - You lose sleep loving them.\\
206 - You lose out on all those other things\\
207 - that you always thought you'd do.\\
208 - But even with all of that,\\
209 - the amazing thing is,\\
210 - you're okay with it.\\
211 - It's like some wonderful... curse.\\
212 - That was amazing.\\
213 - I don't know where you came up with that crap, but you nailed it.\\
214 - Okay, Donna, here we go.\\
215 - "What aspect of being a woman do you find most fulfilling?"\\
216 - What kind of stupid question is that?\\
217 - Excuse me?\\
218 - I don't mean that you're stupid.\\
219 - I... the question is...\\
220 - I mean...\\
221 - I'm not fulfilled.\\
222 - It's awful being a woman, right?\\
223 - Right?\\
224 - I'm cursed with children, too.\\
225 - I never wanted to have kids.\\
226 - I just wanted to...\\
227 - But I do... love America.\\
228 - How 'bout our country, huh?\\
229 - Did you see that?\\
230 - She went up like the Hindenberg.\\
231 - Wow, I guess I'm really doing okay.\\
232 - So are you going to keep wasting time high-fiving yourself,\\
233 - or are we going to get back to work?\\
234 - Okay, honey, that was pretty good.\\
235 - Unfortunately, there are three counties\\
236 - full of women who are "pretty good."\\
237 - We need a winner.\\
238 - I think this would be going so much better\\
239 - if I could sing or dance or play a musical instrument.\\
240 - We'll get to you, Lois.\\
241 - Right now Dewey's our problem.\\
242 - Now, son, I don't know anything about music,\\
243 - but this is how you should be playing it.\\
244 - Now, in the middle part, you're doing\\
245 - And I want to hear more of...\\
246 - That's never gonna happen.\\
247 - You know, I really don't need this from you right now.\\
248 - We've got one day to get the dress ready,\\
249 - our shoes aren't dyed and we have no idea\\
250 - where we're going with our hair!\\
251 - Hal, calm down.\\
252 - What's happening?\\
253 - I thought this was supposed to be fun.\\
254 - It is. See?\\
255 - Mom had better win this thing.\\
256 - I'm getting to know way too much about Herkabe's love life.\\
257 - You got anything yet?\\
258 - This judges' manual is unbelievable.\\
259 - It's over 200 pages of these really specific rules\\
260 - on what's attractive and what isn't.\\
261 - There's a whole page on ankle symmetry.\\
262 - And you know what I learned?\\
263 - What?\\
264 - I'm beautiful.\\
265 - What are you talking about?\\
266 - Everything on my face is the absolute standard of perfection.\\
267 - My lips are exactly twice the length of the distance between my eyes.\\
268 - My philtrum is gracefully tapered.\\
269 - My earlobe is the perfect 1.4 centimeters.\\
270 - And it just goes on and on.\\
271 - You can measure me if you don't believe it.\\
272 - Are you going to help Mom or not?\\
273 - I understand your anger, Malcolm.\\
274 - Unattractive people can become very threatened by this.\\
275 - It's probably why I have so few friends.\\
276 - Malcolm!\\
277 - I need a favor.\\
278 - I already did you a favor with Darlene.\\
279 - Which worked out spectacularly.\\
280 - And athletically.\\
281 - And repeatedly.\\
282 - What else do you want?\\
283 - I need you to break up with her.\\
284 - What?\\
285 - She's gotten so clingy and dependent.\\
286 - She's suffocating me.\\
287 - Feel free to judge me,\\
288 - but remember who's judging your mother.\\
289 - Give her this note.\\
290 - At first I toyed with the idea\\
291 - of lying to her, but then I decided\\
292 - to tell her honestly I find her repellent.\\
293 - It's better to be classy.\\
294 - Malcolm! Find your brother and get back here.\\
295 - The judges need to see all of us\\
296 - gazing adoringly up at your mother.\\
297 - Those Hendersons are making us look like chimps.\\
298 - His smile is fading.\\
299 - Give him another hit.\\
300 - I don't know how you do this.\\
301 - I've never felt such butterflies in my entire life.\\
302 - Good luck, everybody.\\
303 - Your mascara is clumping!\\
304 - What did I tell you about blinking?!\\
305 - What is it?!\\
306 - I know.\\
307 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
308 - welcome to the Miss Tri-County Pageant.\\
309 - Here's your host, Channel Two's acclaimed meteorologist, Dr. Dave Nelson.\\
310 - Hey there, Mrs. Tri-County.\\
311 - A lady from head to toe...\\
312 - A nurse, a maid, a teacher and a hottie...\\
313 - All wrapped up in a bow It's time to sparkle\\
314 - and start the show So come on, take a bow...\\
315 - America needs you like never before\\
316 - and "mom" is just an upside down "wow!"\\
317 - I lost a pin?\\
318 - I lost a pin!\\
319 - Oh, this isn't happening!\\
320 - Hold on.\\
321 - Wait, what are you doing?\\
322 - Now your hair's ruined.\\
323 - So, we'll both be a little off.\\
324 - Come on, everybody, let's go.\\
325 - And please step forward...\\
326 - Charlotte!\\
327 - Ladies and gentlemen,\\
328 - the judges have unanimously decided\\
329 - that these five women will...\\
330 - not be going to the next round!\\
331 - And you ladies are!\\
332 - We're going to take a short\\
333 - break now so our lucky five\\
334 - can get ready for the Glamour Parade!\\
335 - Malcolm. Come here.\\
336 - Malcolm.\\
337 - Reese, what are you doing?\\
338 - Dad's been looking all over for you.\\
339 - I'm leaving, Malcolm.\\
340 - I'm claiming my birthright.\\
341 - What?\\
342 - I'm about to become a star,\\
343 - and from what I understand,\\
344 - I have to ruthlessly separate myself from\\
345 - you pathetic hangers-on,\\
346 - and probably eventually sue your asses.\\
347 - Take care, Malcolm.\\
348 - I'll see you in court.\\
349 - Well, it may be 70 degrees outside,\\
350 - with a 20% chance of rain...\\
351 - ...but it's about to get a lot hotter in here.\\
352 - Where's Jeanie?\\
353 - We were all going to wear tiaras for Glamour Parade and...\\
354 - we're all going to wear tiaras.\\
355 - Thank you, Jeanie.\\
356 - Thank all of you.\\
357 - ...as we present\\
358 - the Mrs. Tri-County\\
359 - Glamour Parade.\\
360 - What's wrong?\\
361 - What happened?\\
362 - Usually,\\
363 - we let the judges decide who gets to wear the tiara.\\
364 - Ladies and gentlemen, please, remain clam.\\
365 - There's no reason to panic.\\
366 - Okay, I'm ready.\\
367 - For what?\\
368 - Whatever it is you do with beautiful people.\\
369 - I'll give you 20% and not a penny more.\\
370 - You may have to travel because\\
371 - I'm going to have a house in Miami, Milan, and that Disneyworld in France.\\
372 - You're welcome to fly my private jet, but I want you to keep it real.\\
373 - I'd also like a falcon.\\
374 - What are you talking about?\\
375 - I can't do anything with you.\\
376 - What? Why not?\\
377 - I've read the book,\\
378 - I measured everything.\\
379 - I'm perfect!\\
380 - It's true, you do have the perfect features for a middle-aged woman.\\
381 - If you want to,\\
382 - have a sex change,\\
383 - come back in 20 years and we'll talk.\\
384 - No, please!\\
385 - This can't be how it ends.\\
386 - I'm supposed to have three rocky marriages and die in a hotel fire!\\
387 - Don't send me home!\\
388 - I'm too perfect to live like a person!\\
389 - Okay, people reacted badly to the crown thing, so you gotta nail the talent portion.\\
390 - Now, I know you think it isn't a talent,\\
391 - but if you commit, we can make\\
392 - those oversized Barbies choke on their own batons.\\
393 - What are you doing?\\
394 - Where's your top hat and fishnet thigh-highs?\\
395 - Just get the car and the kids, Hal,\\
396 - and let's just slink out of here.\\
397 - Wait, you can't just walk away.\\
398 - Oh, yes, I can.\\
399 - This whole thing has been a disaster.\\
400 - I don't belong here.\\
401 - And I hate the way those women make me feel.\\
402 - Come on, they're just a bunch of bitter hags.\\
403 - And I hate the way you've been making me feel.\\
404 - We may have our ups and downs, Hal,\\
405 - but this is the first time I ever felt\\
406 - like I wasn't good enough for you.\\
407 - You're right.\\
408 - I'm sorry.\\
409 - I mean, I know you're perfect, and for once, I wanted the whole world to know it.\\
410 - Well, that's a nice idea,\\
411 - but that isn't going to happen.\\
412 - I don't know why I ever thought I could compete with these women.\\
413 - Hal, I can't handle them.\\
414 - I'm out of my league here.\\
415 - What are you talking about?\\
416 - Do you know why those broads pulled that stunt?\\
417 - They're afraid of you, Lois.\\
418 - Right now you are surrounded\\
419 - by a bunch of idiots who fear you.\\
420 - You're not out of your league, you're at home.\\
421 - Lois, where have you been?\\
422 - Come on, let's go.\\
423 - You're up.\\
424 - You've got to go.\\
425 - Whining isn't going to make me go any faster.\\
426 - Yes!\\
427 - And now our third contestant,\\
428 - Lois, will be accompanied by her lovely daughter, Dewey.\\
429 - There's Mommy.\\
430 - Would the new Mrs.\\
431 - Tri-County like another scoop of fudge ripple?\\
432 - Well, this sash still has a couple of inches of slack.\\
433 - Keep it coming.\\
434 - This is so nice.\\
435 - Look at this.\\
436 - A $40 coupon for new tires,\\
437 - a box of steaks, a label maker!\\
438 - Oh, this is nice.\\
439 - I wish Reese wasn't too busy sulking to enjoy it with us.\\
440 - Give him a little time.
\section {Malcolm in the Middle Season 07}
\subsection {Episode 01: Burning Man}
1 - Boys, cookies!\\
2 - All right!\\
3 - Nuh-uh, not that one.\\
4 - I put Dewey's antibiotics in that one.\\
5 - Take this one. It's biggest.\\
6 - -Did you put anything in this one? -Of course not. Just take it.\\
7 - Then take this one 20 minutes later.\\
8 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.01 - "Burning Man"\\
9 - Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
10 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
11 - There's no doubt about it, we're totally gonna go this year.\\
12 - Totally. It's not even a question.\\
13 - What's there to question?\\
14 - Nothing. Because we're going.\\
15 - -We're totally going. -Totally.\\
16 - Oh, God, Burning Man again?\\
17 - Every year it's the same thing.\\
18 - "This time we're totally going!"\\
19 - "Oh, yeah, totally!"\\
20 - And every year you chicken out with some pathetic excuse.\\
21 - My personal favorite was last year's "really bad Slurpee headache."\\
22 - See? That is exactly the kind of ignorant talk I'd expect from someone\\
23 - who doesn't have any appreciation for what Burning Man is.\\
24 - A week of freedom out in the desert, naked women, getting back\\
25 - to your primal nature, naked women, people doing art, naked women.\\
26 - Are all the women naked?\\
27 - That is all you heard, isn't it?\\
28 - Mom...\\
29 - Dad breakfast...\\
30 - Jamie...\\
31 - Dewey...\\
32 - Dad dinner.\\
33 - <b>WENT TO BURNING MAN BACK MONDAY</b>\\
34 - There. That should get us till tomorrow.\\
35 - I can't believe it. We're really doing it!\\
36 - We're actually going to Burning Man!\\
37 - Hitchhiking?!\\
38 - Hitchhiking on the highway like hobos?!\\
39 - Thank God your mother undercooked the chicken last night, or who knows\\
40 - when we might have found out about this?!\\
41 - What were you thinking?!\\
42 - Sneaking off in the middle of the night to go to some\\
43 - overblown keg party in the desert!\\
44 - That is not what Burning Man is all about.\\
45 - Burning Man is an incredible, interactive experiment in human creativity,\\
46 - where you do art just for art's sake,\\
47 - and you make music from instruments that came to you in dreams.\\
48 - It's the one place where you're free to let go and really see\\
49 - what you're capable of creating without worrying what anyone else thinks!\\
50 - That's what Burning Man is all about!\\
51 - I think she actually might've bought that.\\
52 - This Burning Person sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun. What a great idea, Malcolm.\\
53 - Yeah. Maybe next year we can take Grandma to Mardi Gras.\\
54 - You think I enjoy having powers that I can't control?\\
55 - Believe me, I'd much rather be as stupid as you are.\\
56 - Don't try sucking up to me now.\\
57 - I still can't believe Mr. Barnes let you borrow his fancy RV.\\
58 - This is so classy. This is like Buckingham Palace on wheels.\\
59 - He ripped one on the elevator just before the CEO got on, and I took the blame for it.\\
60 - That's the way things work in the corporate world.\\
61 - You're unselfish, and it paid off.\\
62 - Hey, you boys check out the flat screen TV back in the bedroom?\\
63 - And the two-thirds-scale fold-down pool table?\\
64 - Boy, we're gonna have so much fun in this baby!\\
65 - Whoa, whoa. What was that?\\
66 - I just opened an apple juice for Jamie.\\
67 - And now you can close it back up. I thought I was clear about this.\\
68 - The camper is going back without a single stain, smudge, smell or dent.\\
69 - -Yeah, but I really think Jamie... -Dewey, what is the rule?\\
70 - This one RV is worth three of me.\\
71 - Okay.\\
72 - Help me get this grate off.\\
73 - I'm gonna ditch out when we slow down for a turn.\\
74 - I am not going to Burning Man with Mom and Dad.\\
75 - Reese, we're in the middle of the desert.\\
76 - I know what you're thinking. The road runners are too smart to catch and eat.\\
77 - But the coyotes are idiots.\\
78 - Look, it might not be as embarrassing as we think.\\
79 - If we move quick, we might be able to sneak off\\
80 - without anyone knowing that we came to Burning Man with our parents.\\
81 - We're here!\\
82 - Hey, neighbors!\\
83 - I'm gonna do art, too.\\
84 - I brought my paintbrushes.\\
85 - Okay, let's get moving here.\\
86 - Reese, Malcolm. I want you guys...\\
87 - They're gone.\\
88 - They shimmied under the RV and took off running.\\
89 - Oh. Well, then I guess it's up to you to help me set up a protective perimeter around the camper.\\
90 - We'll need about 40 rocks, at least the size of bowling balls.\\
91 - I'm sorry, son. You snooze, you lose.\\
92 - Now, come on, come on. Don't let the flies get in.\\
93 - Look at this place, it's amazing!\\
94 - That has to be the coolest guy on Earth!\\
95 - See? I told you everything was gonna be all right even with Mom and Dad here.\\
96 - We just need to make sure we look out for each other...\\
97 - -Excuse-me. -Whoa! Ow! Ow! Damn it!\\
98 - I stepped on a cactus. Can you give me a hand?\\
99 - Reese?\\
100 - Hey, buddy?\\
101 - You know where the topless chicks are?\\
102 - And I'm not interested in the uggos or blimps, if you know what I'm saying.\\
103 - Follow me, I'm going that way.\\
104 - Hey, man, want some Stanley?\\
105 - First time at Burning Man?\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - Yeah, I can always tell the newbies.\\
108 - Hey, you guys, you want a little Stanley?\\
109 - What's Stanley?\\
110 - Oh, Stanley was a buddy of mine.\\
111 - We've been coming to Burning Man together almost 20 years.\\
112 - Anyway, he passed on over the winter, and he always said he wanted his ashes\\
113 - scattered here, kind of as a way of spreading the spirit of Burning Man to the people and the family he loved.\\
114 - And you're allowed to do that?\\
115 - Spray a dead guy on people?!\\
116 - I got suspended for a week for putting a mouse's head on the end of my pencil.\\
117 - Burning Man's all about freedom, dude. You can do whatever you want here.\\
118 - Whatever I want?\\
119 - I could kick this over?\\
120 - Or break that?\\
121 - Well, I guess if you really felt you had to.\\
122 - Doesn't that kind of take the fun out of mindless destruction?\\
123 - That's what the flaming catapult's for.\\
124 - Yeah, but the real spirit of Burning Man isn't about destruction.\\
125 - It's about creating, participating, contributing.\\
126 - Building a community that needs you, relies on you.\\
127 - It's about allowing yourself to become part of the whole,\\
128 - and then coming away from it with more than you brought.\\
129 - No, there's no feeling like it in the world.\\
130 - Wow.\\
131 - Yeah, it's a mind-altering journey, son...\\
132 - if you're willing to take it.\\
133 - You know what?\\
134 - I think I want some Stanley.\\
135 - Wow! This stuff is gorgeous. We really have to get some for the house.\\
136 - Howdy!\\
137 - Just getting the old homestead set up.\\
138 - Best hamburgers and dogs you've ever tasted are on me when I get this baby fired up, huh?\\
139 - What's he doing?\\
140 - It's performance art.\\
141 - He's skewering the empty banality of the modern suburban dad.\\
142 - Honey, where'd I put my good basting brush?\\
143 - Honey?\\
144 - Honey?\\
145 - This guy's good.\\
146 - No one told me there was a looky-loo convention in town.\\
147 - Dad, do I have to circle the whole thing?\\
148 - I can't find any more rocks.\\
149 - Son, look, we might be in the desert, but we are still civilized people,\\
150 - and civilized people put up arbitrary boundaries that they will fight to the death to protect.\\
151 - I'm pretty sure we passed some nice-sized rocks when we turned into the camp.\\
152 - That's half a mile away!\\
153 - Don't be silly.\\
154 - Two miles, easy.\\
155 - Here we go!\\
156 - Hal, this place is so great!\\
157 - I met the nicest group of gals down by the Porta Potti's.\\
158 - They call themselves a "tribe," like a group of wild Indians. Isn't that cute?\\
159 - They invited me to the hemp-braiding tent later.\\
160 - What are you using the Porta Potti's for when we have the world's greatest toilet ten feet away in the RV?\\
161 - That thing will suck down a small deer.\\
162 - Mention free food and they start gathering like flies.\\
163 - <b>FIRST AID</b>\\
164 - This is great. I'm gonna spend my entire two days at Burning Man standing in this line.\\
165 - Hey, man.\\
166 - You know, the line's much shorter over in front of the Shaman's tent.\\
167 - The what?\\
168 - Oh, you will love her.\\
169 - She totally cured my plantar's warts.\\
170 - -Thanks, but... -Come on, man.\\
171 - You think I'd lead you wrong?\\
172 - And remember, if you're gonna eat glass, chew at least ten times before you swallow. Okay?\\
173 - Ooh, what do we have here?\\
174 - I stepped on a cactus.\\
175 - The needle went right through my shoe.\\
176 - Let's take a look.\\
177 - It's not a big deal.\\
178 - I think I just need some disinfectant and a band-aid and I'll be...\\
179 - Ma'am?\\
180 - Mmm.\\
181 - You've internalized a lot of criticism, haven't you?\\
182 - Well, I don't know.\\
183 - I guess.\\
184 - But what does...\\
185 - Okay... here's your problem.\\
186 - You have an incredible amount of passion in your soul.\\
187 - But you've got to let down the armor you're using to shield it.\\
188 - You also need a tetanus shot.\\
189 - Okay, she's almost as old as my mom, and obviously crazy as a loon.\\
190 - So why am I so turned on?\\
191 - Most Western medicines numb the body.\\
192 - They silence it.\\
193 - But the body's an amazing thing, Malcolm. It can tell you what's wrong with it.\\
194 - All real healing is just listening.\\
195 - I don't see anything alternative about that.\\
196 - I just don't see colonizing space as the answer.\\
197 - I mean, if we can't solve our problems here,\\
198 - what's the point of just exporting them there?\\
199 - Even Werner Von Braun said that everything science taught him\\
200 - strengthened his belief in the continuity of spiritual existence after death.\\
201 - Okay, I buy that Godzilla came out of the collective purging of Japanese guilt\\
202 - after World War II, but can you explain to me why the costume had to look so fake?\\
203 - Well, let's see...\\
204 - First I'd say...\\
205 - The Go-Go's.\\
206 - Then The Bangles...\\
207 - Bananarama and Josie and the Pussycats.\\
208 - I can't believe it! I hated Charlotte's Web, too!\\
209 - I just wanted to squash that whiny little spider.\\
210 - Deep Dish.\\
211 - Chocolate chip.\\
212 - Oscar the Grouch.\\
213 - Wow. And I thought all that crap everyone said about love was just to piss me off.\\
214 - -So you're going to come? -Oh, absolutely.\\
215 - That sounds like a hoot and a half.\\
216 - Great. It's by the giant foam tongue.\\
217 - Just make a left at the guy in the phone booth full of Jell-O.\\
218 - If you hit the Men's Diaper Brigade you've gone too far.\\
219 - -See you there. -Okay.\\
220 - What's this?\\
221 - The food's all green.\\
222 - I added a little food color.\\
223 - It's artistic.\\
224 - I'm being artistic.\\
225 - Mom's right.\\
226 - I always thought art was just stupid paintings of old dead guys in drag, but I was wrong.\\
227 - Art can be doing something, or even undoing something.\\
228 - Like when I blew up the Muller's mailbox, that was art, and I didn't even know it.\\
229 - Green eggs and toast. I do not like green eggs and toast.\\
230 - Oh, for God's sake, Hal, stretch a little.\\
231 - We're on vacation.\\
232 - Vacation?!\\
233 - Which part of this is vacation?\\
234 - Armor-Alling the tires for six hours, or scraping the dead bugs out of the grill with a toothbrush?\\
235 - Why do they have to play Frisbee so close to the RV?\\
236 - Can't they have fun with that thing without constantly throwing it around?\\
237 - And where's Malcolm?\\
238 - Did he even come home last night?\\
239 - I gotta tell you, Lois, I really don't think I like this place.\\
240 - I think I love this place.\\
241 - No, I'm sure I do.\\
242 - Good morning.\\
243 - Did you know... you are the most incredible woman who ever lived?\\
244 - Well, I knew I was in the top three. But I guess your vote clinches it.\\
245 - So, are we going to spend the day together?\\
246 - I thought we could go check out the Circle of Infinity...\\
247 - Oh, I have a ton of re-birthing ceremonies to do today.\\
248 - But we can get together later. How about that?\\
249 - Sure, that sounds great.\\
250 - What's the matter?\\
251 - Nothing.\\
252 - I'm happy.\\
253 - Really, really happy.\\
254 - No, there's something the matter, but I just can't pin it down.\\
255 - Nothing's wrong.\\
256 - You go do your re-birthing whatevers, and we'll get together later.\\
257 - Contempt. That's it.\\
258 - What are you talking about?\\
259 - You have contempt for me, and for what I do.\\
260 - No, no, not at all.\\
261 - I should really just keep my mouth shut for the next five seconds.\\
262 - Four, three...\\
263 - I mean, it is a pretty silly ritual, but I guess I don't see any real harm in it.\\
264 - You know, I have a lot to do today and I think you should probably go.\\
265 - -No... -Good-bye, Malcolm.\\
266 - This guy's really captured something here.\\
267 - This piece is as vicious as it is funny.\\
268 - What are you looking at?!\\
269 - Haven't you ever seen a man sweep his lawn with a broom before?\\
270 - Okay, that's enough. I've had it.\\
271 - Go on, get out of here, you punks.\\
272 - What the hell is wrong with you people?!\\
273 - Doesn't anybody have respect for personal property anymore?\\
274 - You can think about that for a few days until I give this back to you.\\
275 - I bet orphanages don't take family trips.\\
276 - Or kids raised by animals.\\
277 - How come they get all the breaks?\\
278 - Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes now.\\
279 - Oh, my gosh.\\
280 - This is fantastic.\\
281 - Oh... I wish there was a JC Penney nearby. I'd love to get wallets of this.\\
282 - Who's stupid idea was it to come here, anyway?\\
283 - I'm with you, Malcolm.\\
284 - We don't belong here.\\
285 - This place is full of freaks and weirdoes.\\
286 - And now your mother and Jamie are out there with them, doing God knows what.\\
287 - You're going to be okay, Malcolm, because you are just like me.\\
288 - -I am? -Well, sure.\\
289 - They say we're stubborn, they say we're closed-minded, but I say there's\\
290 - nothing closed-minded about shunning ideas that make you scared and uncomfortable.\\
291 - Yeah.\\
292 - And who cares if they say we're afraid of life?\\
293 - Life is scary.\\
294 - Life is things eating things.\\
295 - I say let everyone out there go ahead and eat each other.\\
296 - You and I we're gonna be in here together, safe and sound.\\
297 - I've been a total idiot.\\
298 - I've got to get over myself.\\
299 - Where are you going?\\
300 - Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you, young man!\\
301 - Get... off... my... property!\\
302 - What? What did I do?\\
303 - -Come with us. -Wait. I want my lawyer.\\
304 - He's the naked guy in the buffalo head.\\
305 - It's okay, Reese, you're not in any trouble.\\
306 - We want you to be the torchbearer for the big Burning Man ceremony.\\
307 - -You do? -Absolutely.\\
308 - I can't think of anyone who has embraced and embodied the spirit of the festival more than you have.\\
309 - Really?\\
310 - Wow.\\
311 - Hey, don't say anything to my lawyer, okay?\\
312 - I don't want to have to give him a piece of this.\\
313 - Open yourselves to the energy of re-birthing.\\
314 - I can do this.\\
315 - I can be open-minded.\\
316 - So it's a little weird.\\
317 - Most rituals are a little weird, right?\\
318 - He really needs a fresh start.\\
319 - We made a lot of mistakes his first two days.\\
320 - Okay, so it's totally insane.\\
321 - I don't care, I'm doing it.\\
322 - I got to tell you, man, you've been fantastic.\\
323 - Thanks.\\
324 - What's this for?\\
325 - What's it for? It's to set him on fire.\\
326 - What?!\\
327 - That's how we end Burning Man, man, by burning the man.\\
328 - But it can't end.\\
329 - I don't want it to.\\
330 - For my first time in my life I've been real, like I belong.\\
331 - We've all been there, man. But it still has to end.\\
332 - But why?\\
333 - That's just the way it is.\\
334 - Look, it's cool if you don't want to...\\
335 - Get back!\\
336 - Everyone just stay back! No one's burning Burning Man!\\
337 - Malcolm?\\
338 - What are you doing here?\\
339 - I did it. I actually did it.\\
340 - You re-birthed yourself...\\
341 - -For me? -No.\\
342 - Well, yeah, originally, but something happened in there.\\
343 - I mean, I was able to open my mind and be accepting of something I didn't believe in.\\
344 - I've never been able to do that before.\\
345 - It's amazing, I actually feel like I've been reborn.\\
346 - It feels fantastic.\\
347 - And it's all thanks to you.\\
348 - Oh, Malcolm.\\
349 - We can never see each other again.\\
350 - -What? -This can never work.\\
351 - You're just way to manuable.\\
352 - The condescending cynic, I could deal with, but this...\\
353 - I don't want you doing things just because I want you to do them.\\
354 - Then I won't. If that's what you want.\\
355 - Crap.\\
356 - I'm sorry, Malcolm.\\
357 - Life is a journey at you have to take on your own.\\
358 - I've tried my own journey. It s sucks.\\
359 - Please, please, please, just take me with you.\\
360 - I don't take up a lot of space.\\
361 - -You have to go now. -But...\\
362 - Great.\\
363 - Who knew this life could be even crappier than the last one?\\
364 - Stay back!\\
365 - Stay back! I mean it!\\
366 - Get in the van, Reese. We're going home.\\
367 - Dad, you gotta help me.\\
368 - They want me to burn Burning Man.\\
369 - Oh, for crying out loud, just torch the bastard and we're out of here.\\
370 - I'm ready.\\
371 - I finally got your precious floor mats clean.\\
372 - -Let's get the hell out of here. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
373 - Are you insane? You're not going into my beautiful van looking like that.\\
374 - Hey!\\
375 - Here come the Trumpet Strumpets.\\
376 - Let's burn the man!\\
377 - Reese.\\
378 - You behave yourself, young man. You hear me?\\
379 - You look incredible, honey.\\
380 - Now get in the van.\\
381 - -No! No, please! -Burning Man! Burning Man!\\
382 - Burning Man! Burning Man!\\
383 - -No! Please, no! -Burning Man! Burning Man!\\
384 - -No, no! Burning Man can't end. -Burning Man! Burning Man!\\
385 - I won't let it!\\
386 - Burning van! Burning van!\\
387 - Burning van! Burning van!\\
388 - Burning van! Burning van...\\
389 - I still can't believe how awesome Burning Man was.\\
390 - Next year we're totally going back, right?\\
391 - Totally.\\
392 - Okay, so Burning Man didn't turn out as great as I thought it would.\\
393 - But I think I'll get over it a lot faster than Dad will.\\
394 - His boss really loved that RV.\\
395 - Don't wait up.\\
396 - I probably won't be home until dawn again.\\
397 - Tonight I'm digging him a new septic tank.\\
398 - Come on, Dewey.\\
399 - First we gotta relocate the pet cemetery.
\subsection {Episode 02: Health Insurance}
1 - -Eat faster! -Don't chew it. Just swallow it!\\
2 - Nothing.\\
3 - Granted, this isn't scientific, but the fact that Reese can't get brain freeze has to prove something.\\
4 - Wait.\\
5 - I'm feeling something in my toes.\\

9 - -We did it! We finally got back at Tim Schwab and his brother. -What'd you do?\\
10 - We found a dead octopus in a dumpster at the seafood store.\\
11 - We shoved its mouth full of medical waste and put it in the Schwabs' air conditioner.\\
12 - That'll teach them to say we're obnoxious.\\
13 - Why didn't you let me help?\\
14 - It couldn't wait, Dewey.\\
15 - With a dead octopus, there's a very small window before it starts smelling like just another dead fish.\\
16 - Reese, your hands still stink.\\
17 - Yeah...\\
18 - Like victory.\\
19 - We can't take a walk without our jackets anymore, Jamie.\\
20 - It's the first cool day of fall.\\
21 - Fall reminds adults about our mortality, but for you, it's just pretty leaves.\\
22 - Hmm. What's this?\\
23 - You're telling me my family's hasn't had health insurance for the last six months?!\\
24 - Yes, I know you never got the check!\\
25 - There must be some sort of grace period.\\
26 - And when those two months are over, what's the grace period on that?\\
27 - No, no, you can't wait until Monday to reinstate us.\\
28 - We can't go through the whole weekend without health insurance.\\
29 - Listen, listen, I am speaking to you from a house full of walking time bombs.\\
30 - Well, then you're just a bunch of lousy, heartless bastards!\\
31 - -Who you talking to? -March of Dimes.\\
32 - I've got to go to work early. Hattie's called another secret meeting about the union.\\
33 - -Uh-uh. -Goodbye.\\
34 - Bye, hon.\\
35 - Listen, Jim.\\
36 - Can I call you Jim?\\
37 - Oh, okay, Steven.\\
38 - Let me level with you.\\
39 - Six months ago my wife asked me to do one thing. One.\\
40 - I was supposed to mail your check.\\
41 - The woman relies on the fact that I can be\\
42 - occasionally trusted to perform very simple menial tasks.\\
43 - Now, if you don't start my insurance, and if anything happens to anyone in this family,\\
44 - I am gonna have to explain to her that her entire life is built on a lie!\\
45 - Well, I just hope that when your marriage blows up in your face, I'm there to see it!\\
46 - Okay, Jamie, for the next two days there's no getting sick. There's no getting owies.\\
47 - All of the safety rules your mother and I told you about, well, starting today, we mean them.\\
48 - Hi, I'm Connie Guzman, Teddy's mother.\\
49 - I guess our little guys are gonna have a play date this morning.\\
50 - Oh, right.\\
51 - I'm, I'm Hal.\\
52 - I was so relieved we could schedule something today.\\
53 - I've got a killer day ahead.\\
54 - What was that?\\
55 - It was just his allergies.\\
56 - Allergies?\\
57 - Or disease?\\
58 - There are a lot of viruses going around.\\
59 - Some of these kids are nothing but walking germ bags.\\
60 - He seems a little unresponsive.\\
61 - Is Jamie's mother home?\\
62 - Boy, I do not like the way this gland feels.\\
63 - What did his poop look like this morning?\\
64 - Mommy...\\
65 - You know, I'm not sure Teddy's up for a play date today.\\
66 - -Oh, Jamie will be so disappointed. -Come on, Teddy.\\
67 - -You're going to Mommy's job interview. -We'll do it again some other time.\\
68 - Just make sure you bring a note from his doctor.\\
69 - What are you doing?! This is not a toy!\\
70 - I didn't think I was cutting my bagel with a toy.\\
71 - This is plenty sharp.\\
72 - Wait!\\
73 - Here.\\
74 - And use the handle.\\
75 - I'm living in a death house.\\
76 - And that's why I propose we affiliate ourselves with the Teamsters.\\
77 - They can deliver a benefits package that's quite substantial.\\
78 - It's all spelled out in this literature.\\
79 - Well, I think this is a bad idea.\\
80 - Bad, bad, bad!\\
81 - Craig, it can't hurt to just listen.\\
82 - When Mr. Cochran finds out we're talking union, we'll lose all our perks.\\
83 - What perks?\\
84 - We get to wear the smocks on our days off.\\
85 - And they're talking about fixing the hand dryer in the men's room.\\
86 - I just want to thank Hattie for organizing this meeting.\\
87 - I think it's about time the people who really do the work around here start standing up for ourselves.\\
88 - I for one, am sick of no overtime, no job security...\\
89 - Excuse me, Joe, I just want to say that Mr. Cochran makes a lot more money than us.\\
90 - And I strongly feel that on that basis alone, he should be trusted.\\
91 - Oh, for God's sake, Craig.\\
92 - You know what really bothers me?\\
93 - When I see Mr. Cochran parking his car out front every morning and we've got to park nine blocks away.\\
94 - -They let us use the shuttle to get to our cars. -That's the city bus, Craig.\\
95 - I appreciate all the anger that's in this room, and God knows I'm not one\\
96 - to shy away from a fight, but I suggest that instead of starting a union,\\
97 - we form a special committee to maybe paint Mr. Cochran's house so he'll want to be nice to us.\\
98 - Sit down and shut up, Feldspar.\\
99 - You know what?\\
100 - I've worked here for almost ten years.\\
101 - I have never felt we needed a union, but when I think about what this place has done to some of us,\\
102 - how it's made us so afraid to even voice our opinions, then I think maybe we do.\\
103 - Okay, but let the record show that I advocated a policy of cowardice and appeasement.\\
104 - Oh. Come here.\\
105 - Hi.\\
106 - Okay.\\
107 - Hattie's still holding these secret union meetings during our breaks.\\
108 - It's so complicated.\\
109 - We would have to pay dues, but we'd save on health insurance.\\
110 - Oh, really? How fast would we get health insurance?\\
111 - Hattie thinks we can start serious talks with the Teamsters next month.\\
112 - Oh, who cares?\\
113 - Boys, breakfast.\\
114 - Hal, where are all the forks?\\
115 - Oh, uh, they were all bent out of shape so I sent them out to that guy who fixes them.\\
116 - The "fork straightener"?\\
117 - It's the man's work, Lois. I don't think we should make fun.\\
118 - Hal, how are the boys gonna eat scrambled eggs without forks?\\
119 - I have to go.\\
120 - Honey, you know what's a great look?\\
121 - I saw this gal the other day, had a bike helmet, and I thought, "Why the heck can't women look this good all the time?"\\
122 - Oh, baby.\\
123 - Hal, you're messing up my hair.\\
124 - Okay, look, just buckle up and drive slowly.\\
125 - Get there late, but get there!\\
126 - Let this be a lesson to every one of you.\\
127 - -What's going on with Hattie? -Cochran fired her this morning.\\
128 - He said it was for dressing provocatively, but he obviously found out\\
129 - that she's been calling the union meetings.\\
130 - That's horrible.\\
131 - Somebody around here's been snitching to Cochran.\\
132 - Craig, is there something you want to tell me?\\
133 - No, no, not really.\\
134 - Why won't you look me in the eye?\\
135 - Why won't you look me in the eye?\\
136 - I can play this game as long as you can, Lois.\\
137 - I'll be watching you, Craig.\\
138 - Nice cover.\\
139 - Oh, my God!\\
140 - What is it?\\
141 - The Schwabs sent out a mass e-mail to everyone at school.\\
142 - They Photoshopped our heads onto a dirty movie.\\
143 - Gross!\\
144 - That can't be a dirty movie. There aren't any girls in it.\\
145 - Oh, my God!\\
146 - I'm not homophobic.\\
147 - If the three of us were gay lovers, I'd be fine with this.\\
148 - But it's not true!\\
149 - This is so humiliating.\\
150 - My abs are way more ripped than that guy's.\\
151 - We've got to respond.\\
152 - Well, I was saving this one to what grade Mr. Watts was going to give me,\\
153 - but we can climb up on their roof and drop a wasp nest down their chimney.\\
154 - I have one ready.\\
155 - I've been teasing the for months to keep them angry.\\
156 - Perfect.\\
157 - What does it take to keep you boys safe?\\
158 - Dad, you don't know what the Schwabs did.\\
159 - I don't care what they did!\\
160 - What is the matter with you boys?\\
161 - Don't you realize you could get killed?!\\
162 - Dad, I'm not going to die.\\
163 - -What? -I'm 17.\\
164 - And so you can't die?\\
165 - I just don't see it happening.\\
166 - I've got news for you, Reese. 17-year-olds die all the time.\\
167 - Oh, come on, Dad.\\
168 - That's just something they tell you so you'll stay off drugs.\\
169 - That's it!\\
170 - You're all grounded in your room for the rest of weekend!\\
171 - You can't do that!\\
172 - I know I'm gonna die, Dad.\\
173 - Nobody is dying in this family until the start of business Monday morning!\\
174 - Okay, should there be an actual fire, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.\\
175 - Did you hear?\\
176 - We did a little investigating.\\
177 - We found out who Cochran's snitch is.\\
178 - -Oh, no... -It's Joe.\\
179 - Joe?\\
180 - -What about Craig? -What about Craig?\\
181 - Uh, does Craig know that it's Joe?\\
182 - Everybody knows.\\
183 - Cochran just promoted Joe to manager. We're going to go congratulate him.\\
184 - Can you hand me some soap?\\
185 - Sure.\\
186 - Wow, I had it completely wrong.\\
187 - Did you get any information I asked for, Felspar.\\
188 - Yes, sir. Lois almost caught me, but I can assure you our secret is safe.\\
189 - Good, good, excellent. Now you've gotta tell me everything.\\
190 - Of course, sir.\\
191 - I'll need a complete list of names thise.\\
192 - They're all here.\\
193 - Just please, sir, make sure this stays quiet.\\
194 - Don't worry about it.\\
195 - Thank you, Mr. Cochran.\\
196 - Looks and brains, you're the complete package, sir!\\
197 - What the hell are you doing talking with Mr Cochran, Craig.\\
198 - Okay, Lois. If you can tell me what you think you saw, that would really help me focus my answer.\\
199 - You grabbed hair! You grabbed hair!\\
200 - Craig, I heard you talking about a list of names.\\
201 - Oh, that. Um.\\
202 - We were just rating all the hottie in the store.\\
203 - Don't worry. You're holding your own in both posture and dimples.\\
204 - -You expect me to fall for that? -I'd appreciated.\\
205 - Craig how could you?\\
206 - Get away from me, you animals!\\
207 - Oh, my God. Joe.\\
208 - Stop!\\
209 - Stay out of this, Lois. This is retail justice.\\
210 - Pull it off.\\
211 - But you're making a mistake. Joe isn't the snitch!\\
212 - What?!\\
213 - The real snitch just confessed to me.\\
214 - -Who is it? -I'm not going to tell you. I don't want you hurting him.\\
215 - -He's a misguided, weak, pathetic individual who... -It's Craig!\\
216 - Wait!\\
217 - Dad, why are you doing this?\\
218 - We're gonna call child welfare, and this time they'll come.\\
219 - Please don't do this, Dad! It's just not necessary.\\
220 - There. Now we can finally have a nice safe week-end around here.\\
221 - Let's do it.\\
222 - I told you this was worth spending Christmas vacation at Home Depot.\\
223 - Wait. Dad's gonna kill us when he realizes we're gone.\\
224 - Maybe we can just pretend we're too secure to care what the Schwabs think of us.\\
225 - Nobody's gonna buy that.\\
226 - We can't let this stand, Dewey.\\
227 - Remember the day everybody started calling Booger Boy "Booger Boy" and he didn't do anything about it?\\
228 - -What is his real name anyway? -Nobody remembers.\\
229 - I'm in.\\
230 - -Dad's under there! -Oh, my God you're right!\\
231 - -Let's go! -No, no, no.\\
232 - -You boys are in so much trouble. -I'm calling Mom.\\
233 - Dad, are you okay?\\
234 - I can't feel anything below my left knee.\\
235 - Is my foot okay?\\
236 - Your foot looks fine.\\
237 - But I think the rest of you is facing the wrong way.\\
238 - I can't find him anywhere. Have you seen Craig?\\
239 - No.\\
240 - So now on Lois, I'm off to the head office. A place we're washing your hands\\
241 - after using the restroom is a matter of personal choice. -Good-bye, Joe.\\
242 - -By the way, what did Cochran give you to cover for me? -What?\\
243 - You know, for throwing Craig under the truck. Taking the heat off me.\\
244 - -You really are Cochran's snitch? -No, I'm getting kickedtairs because of my skills and motivation.\\
245 - But that's impossible. I saw Craig handing Cochran a list of names.\\
246 - What?\\
247 - Oh, those were probably names for that stupid surprise party he's throwing for you.\\
248 - What are you talking about?\\
249 - Craig wanted make a big deal of your tenth anniversary of working here.\\
250 - I told him would just depress you, but know Craig.\\
251 - Cleanup in the storeroom.\\
252 - Oh, my God.\\
253 - Craig!\\
254 - I'm so sorry.\\
255 - Why didn't you tell me you were playing a party?\\
256 - You know ?\\
257 - -Oh Lord, this day just keep getting worse. -Oh, Craig, this is all my fault.\\
258 - I just feel awful about this. I'll do whatever it take to make this up to you. I'll even...\\
259 - Oh, hold on a second.\\
260 - Allo?\\
261 - Mom, it's an emergency. You've go to home quick. Something horrible happened.\\
262 - Allo? Dewey? Dewey!\\
263 - Lois, if you could just get the ropes. My hands are wet, I think wrists are bleeding.\\
264 - I'll be right back.\\
265 - Party starts at 5:00.\\
266 - See? Better than you.\\
267 - -That's not going to work, Dad. -We really have to get to the hospital.\\
268 - I can't go to the hospital!\\
269 - Nobody in this family can go to the hospital. We've got no insurance.\\
270 - Why do you think I've been so concerned about your safety?\\
271 - Dad, it's not the end of the world.\\
272 - Of course it is. Your mother will never forgive me.\\
273 - This is worse than the time I left Dewey in Mexico.\\
274 - This is unforgivable.\\
275 - I'm unforgivable.\\
276 - Whoa. I didn't think Dad would get this pathetic 'till we locked him in a nursing home.\\
277 - This family deserves better than me.\\
278 - Your mother's home, boys.\\
279 - Help me up.\\
280 - I raced home!\\
281 - What is it?\\
282 - -Honey there's something you should know. -Nine minutes and 23 seconds. I win.\\
283 - What are you talking about?\\
284 - We made a bet to see how quickly you could get here if you thought there was an emergency.\\
285 - You don't win. Reese said ten minutes.\\
286 - But you're not allowed to go over.\\
287 - You can't decide that now. That's cheating!\\
288 - You did what?!\\
289 - I don't blame you for being mad, Mom.\\
290 - Reese underestimates you all the time.\\
291 - This is just a game?!\\
292 - You made me race across town thinking one of you was dying and it's just a game?!\\
293 - We got bored. There's not much to do around here.\\
294 - Yeah, maybe if you took us on a trip once in a while...\\
295 - Hal, do you hear this?\\
296 - I'm on it, Lois.\\
297 - I can't believe that...\\
298 - Hal, are you crying?\\
299 - With rage!\\
300 - You know how mad I get when these boys pull stunts like this.\\
301 - There's something fishy about this.\\
302 - Fishy is a nice way to put it, Lois.\\
303 - They are gonna get the grounding of their life.\\
304 - They are gonna feel the full brunt of my wrath.\\
305 - Oh, I've been wrong about so much lately I don't even trust my own radar.\\
306 - I got to get back to work.\\
307 - You start the punishment, Hal, but leave some for me.\\
308 - Drive safely.\\
309 - It's gonna be okay, Dad.\\
310 - It's a very special moment when a father watches his boys lie to their mother for him.\\
311 - There's only one thing that could make this moment prouder.\\
312 - If one of you could saw off my leg.\\
313 - Don't worry, Dad.\\
314 - We'll get your knee taken care of.\\
315 - I told you. We have no medical insurance. There's no way.\\
316 - Dad.\\
317 - This is what we do.\\
318 - Happy anniversary, Lois.\\
319 - I chewed through my ropes so I could have this set up for you when you got back.\\
320 - Oh, Craig.\\
321 - I invited the entire staff, but I guess they didn't show up,\\
322 - on account of seeing me as human garbage.\\
323 - I wish you'd be mad at me.\\
324 - Yell at me, tell me I'm a horrible person. Please.\\
325 - Don't apologize, Lois.\\
326 - If you want to make me happy, just sit down and enjoy your party.\\
327 - Hello, everybody.\\
328 - Here's one I'm sure you'll all remember.\\
329 - Here she comes now, our Lois, Lois.\\
330 - Struttin' down the aisle like she doesn't know us.\\
331 - Hey, she wears a smock and she looks all right, yeah.\\
332 - You gotta scan and stock and mark the cat chow...\\
333 - Meow, meow, meow, meow.\\
334 - Yeah.\\
335 - Yeah.\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - Yeah.\\
338 - -Yeah. -Yeah.\\
339 - Yeah.\\
340 - 'Cause she's been here ten...\\
341 - ...Years.\\
342 - Through the laughs, through the tears.\\
343 - Punchin' in. Punchin' out.\\
344 - 'Cept that time she had gout.\\
345 - I say yeah.\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - Yeah.\\
348 - Yeah.\\
349 - Yeah.\\
350 - -Yeah. -Yeah.\\
351 - Yeah.\\
352 - -Yeah. -Yeah.\\
353 - Yeah, the knee's dislocated.\\
354 - So what are you? Some kind of prodigy genius doctor?\\
355 - No, my dad's a really bad doctor.\\
356 - He lets me use his stuff.\\
357 - -You know, boys. I'm not sure we need Richard. -He does great work, Dad.\\
358 - He set my nose three times.\\
359 - He gave me a tracheotomy with a crazy straw.\\
360 - What kind of anesthetic do you use?\\
361 - Well, in a case like this, you're gonna need about eight c.c.'s of... Grab him!\\
362 - No!\\
363 - Hey, look at that.

1 - While Betty kept the fat man occupied, I ducked down the hallway to his office.\\
2 - If I found his phone records, they would prove that he was the one who called the police station on the night of the murder.\\
3 - All I knew was, the next person through that door would be the man who killed my partner.\\
4 - "Hello, McKendrick," I heard from behind me.\\
5 - I spun around, but standing there was...\\

11 - All right, Reese, you're busted.\\
12 - Of all the stupid... Come on, front and center.\\
13 - Now, don't blame yourself.\\
14 - Dewey, you were smoking?\\
15 - Do you have any idea what a dangerous, disgusting addiction that is?\\
16 - It took me years to quit!\\
17 - Do you want to end up breathing through a hole in your neck?\\
18 - Do you think that's cool?\\
19 - You can breathe through a hole in your neck?\\
20 - What do you think your mother's gonna say about this?\\
21 - You can't tell Mom! She'll kill me!\\
22 - Well, you should've thought of that earlier.\\
23 - Where would you even get cigarettes anyway?\\
24 - There's, like, 20 cartons hidden in your shop vac.\\
25 - Oh, my God. That is my stash from ten years ago.\\
26 - Lois would kill me if...\\
27 - All right, Dewey, under the circumstances, I am giving you your one free pass.\\
28 - -Free pass? -That's right.\\
29 - I have given each of your brothers one free pass, one time that I didn't tell your mother about something they did.\\
30 - All right, Francis, this is your one free pass!\\
31 - Okay, Reese, but this is your one!\\
32 - Okay, Malcolm, this is your one!\\
33 - Please make this my one free pass.\\
34 - All right.\\
35 - We've got some paperwork to sign.\\
36 - Chair.\\
37 - Book.\\
38 - Window.\\
39 - Mama.\\
40 - Come on, Jamie, you can talk, just one word.\\
41 - Hal, has Jamie said anything in front of you yet?\\
42 - Whatever he said, he's a liar, Lois! He hasn't seen anything.\\
43 - What are you talking about?\\
44 - What are you talking about?\\
45 - I'm worried about Jamie. He's...\\
46 - However old he is, and he hasn't said a word yet.\\
47 - I thought that's what we liked about him.\\
48 - You know, it's probably his filthy ears.\\
49 - I bet he's all plugged up with wax and he can't hear anything.\\
50 - I don't think so.\\
51 - Relax, honey. Kids go at their own pace.\\
52 - Heck, in sixth grade, I had a full beard, and I still couldn't tie my shoes properly.\\
53 - Ah. There you are.\\
54 - Stevie, you ran off without your backup inhaler.\\
55 - Thanks... Dad.\\
56 - -Did Stevie tell you his big news? -No. What's going on?\\
57 - Stevie's been accepted as a research subject at the Norvet Biomedical Institute.\\
58 - Dr. Norvet himself picked him for the motor-neuropathy program.\\
59 - It's... nothing.\\
60 - Nothing?\\
61 - Come on, Stevie. This is the most exciting thing that's happened to us since they put your stomach on the inside.\\
62 - Who knows?\\
63 - This Christmas might just be our first ski vacation.\\
64 - Dad...\\
65 - Tomorrow after school we'll go look at snowboards.\\
66 - -Dad... -I said just look.\\
67 - My desk!\\
68 - Reese! What's your problem?\\
69 - He's my problem.\\
70 - I get to come home to my own room and put my own stuff on my own desk.\\
71 - There's such a thing as manners, Stevie.\\
72 - When you're a guest in someone's house...\\
73 - Real classy, Reese.\\
74 - Go ahead, hit him.\\
75 - It's not fair!\\
76 - He's hit me plenty of times.\\
77 - He makes fun of me, he treats me like crap,\\
78 - and just because he's in that chair he gets away with it!\\
79 - I blame...\\
80 - society.\\
81 - Sorry, Stevie.\\
82 - Good.\\
83 - Malcolm, get your dirty socks off this table or I'll feed them to you for dinner!\\
84 - Like I'd taste a difference.\\
85 - I'm gonna do it anyway.\\
86 - What?\\
87 - I'm gonna beat you up anyway.\\
88 - This Friday after school, we're gonna go somewhere private\\
89 - and I'm gonna beat you so bad your wheelchair's gonna need a wheelchair.\\
90 - I want you to think about that for a few days. Picture it.\\
91 - Dream about it, like I'm doing.\\
92 - Even if you tell on me, I will find some way to make this happen.\\
93 - So you might as well have some dignity and keep your mouth shut.\\
94 - Your ass might not know I'm kicking it, but I will.\\
95 - Here you go.\\
96 - All right, Jamie.\\
97 - The doctor said there's no physical reason you can't talk,\\
98 - so that is exactly what you are going to do.\\
99 - Talk.\\
100 - He said the best way to get you started is for me to talk to you constantly\\
101 - about everything happening around you so that you live in a more verbal world.\\
102 - That means Mommy's going to narrate everything she's doing\\
103 - like right now when she's going over here to make you a snack.\\
104 - Then it'll be time to do the laundry, and after that she gets to make dinner for the whole family.\\
105 - Who will wolf it down in ten seconds and leave her to do the dishes by herself before she gets to make the boys' lunches for school the next day.\\
106 - Then she'll get ready for bed after everybody else.\\
107 - And discover that the bathroom is a swampy, hairy mess,\\
108 - and Mommy gets to spend her last waking minutes with a sponge and a can of cleanser.\\
109 - Then it'll be time to wake up in the morning and she'll do it all over again.\\
110 - Day after day, week after week, for the next 30 years until Mommy dies.\\
111 - And with Mommy's luck, even that won't be the end of it...\\
112 - Dewey! Get out here right now.\\
113 - You're smoking again after we talked about this last week?\\
114 - You know what that does to you.\\
115 - I'm cutting back.\\
116 - Cutting back?\\
117 - How many cigarettes are you smoking?\\
118 - Under two packs a day.\\
119 - What?!\\
120 - How is that even possible?\\
121 - I got rid of the cartons in the garage.\\
122 - Well, you didn't get rid of the ones hidden in the crawlspace.\\
123 - Or the rain gutters, or under the ivy.\\
124 - There's thousands of cigarettes hidden all over the place.\\
125 - How could you spend all that money and not even smoke them?\\
126 - I could have gone to private school.\\
127 - Keep it down.\\
128 - Look, Dewey, I'm sorry, but I had such a hard time quitting.\\
129 - The only way I could do it without freaking out was knowing they were there.\\
130 - -I know it sounds crazy. -I'll tell you what's crazy.\\
131 - Being hooked on these stupid things even though I hate the way they taste and smell.\\
132 - Well, those are really stale.\\
133 - You're not getting the fresh, rich flavor...\\
134 - Never mind!\\
135 - The point is, you can beat this.\\
136 - We'll do it together.\\
137 - Listen, you know how much I love coffee, right?\\
138 - Yeah, I've seen you drink it in the shower.\\
139 - Exactly. I must drink three pots a day, easy.\\
140 - Well, I'm willing to give it up for you, cold turkey, if you give up smoking.\\
141 - -Really? -Absolutely.\\
142 - That way we're both suffering.\\
143 - We both know what the other's going through and we can support each other.\\
144 - You and me, Dewey. We'll be a team.\\
145 - That sounds great, Dad.\\
146 - Just let me have one more to get it out of my system. We can start...\\
147 - -Dewey. -All right.\\
148 - Come on, Stevie, pay attention.\\
149 - You just had Hitler invade Malibu.\\
150 - Sorry.\\
151 - What's up with you lately?\\
152 - Hi, guys.\\
153 - Hey, Reese, how'd it go with the principal?\\
154 - Fantastic.\\
155 - I love when they get old and they start just phoning it in.\\
156 - He's actually willing to believe this is from obsessive hand washing.\\
157 - Reese took out Scotty Riselli today. It was brutal.\\
158 - You should have seen it.\\
159 - He hit him so hard, a few times he actually lifted him up in the air.\\
160 - And the blood was, I mean, there's always blood,\\
161 - but Scotty was like one of those big sprinklers, you know?\\
162 - And once he went down, Reese went to work on him.\\
163 - Did you know he had dental tools?\\
164 - Hey, I get Africa.\\
165 - Can I...\\
166 - ask you something?\\
167 - Sure.\\
168 - Do you find...\\
169 - my personality...\\
170 - abrasive?\\
171 - What?\\
172 - Do you think...\\
173 - I'm needlessly...\\
174 - antagonistic?\\
175 - I don't know. Probably. What do you care?\\
176 - I don't...\\
177 - want anyone...\\
178 - to hate me.\\
179 - It's Lisa Filmore, isn't it?\\
180 - Who?\\
181 - I saw you checking her out.\\
182 - You like the big stuff, huh? Nice.\\
183 - Little jiggly-wiggly, little wabbal-abbal-abbal-abbal...\\
184 - You're... a jerk.\\
185 - I'm just being supportive. I'm sorry.\\
186 - Come on. Let's just finish the game.\\
187 - Can't.\\
188 - Today's our...\\
189 - first meeting...\\
190 - at the Norvet Institute.\\
191 - Okay, wait.\\
192 - There's something good about your personality.\\
193 - You completely humor your dad with all his idiotic plans for you to walk, no matter how pointless and stupid it is to try.\\
194 - You're never, like, "Dad, wake up."\\
195 - "I'm never getting out of this wheelchair. I'm going to be a cripple till the day I die."\\
196 - I mean, you know it, but you don't throw it in his face.\\
197 - That's a really nice quality.\\
198 - There, better?\\
199 - And so I spend all this time every morning on my hair, trying to get it just so, although I know no one else notices.\\
200 - It's such a stupid vanity thing.\\
201 - I don't know why I'm so neurotic about my hair. You know, it's just ridiculous if you think about it.\\
202 - Wish I could let it go, but it's like I just can't help myself.\\
203 - Slow down. You haven't had breakfast yet.\\
204 - Well, if you got me the nicotine gum like I asked, then...\\
205 - You okay?\\
206 - Oh, that? That's nothing, Lois. That's just...\\
207 - puberty.\\
208 - You know, when a boy's lungs drop.\\
209 - This is how it hits all the men in my family.\\
210 - Hacking cough, dark circles under the eyes, yellowing fingers.\\
211 - So, there I am, 13 years old, flat-chested as I can be,\\
212 - everyone around me is sprouting, and I'm feeling just horrible about myself.\\
213 - And why?\\
214 - No reason at all.\\
215 - I'm getting straight A's, I'm running the food drive,\\
216 - I'm all-county on the gymnastics team, and none of this means anything to me because I'm so fixated on my bustline.\\
217 - And so like an idiot, I started stuffing my bra with toilet paper.\\
218 - Even after all these years, I remember every morning in the bathroom,\\
219 - shoving these things down my shirt and feeling like such an awkward, ugly, little girl.\\
220 - Thank you.\\
221 - Of course in second-period Spanish I had to sit next to the snooty Janice Montgomery\\
222 - with her tangerine nail polish, which I was dying to try, but of course she wouldn't let me because I had drugstore shoes.\\
223 - Hey, Mom.\\
224 - Look at these stains.\\
225 - You boys are in so much trouble.\\
226 - No more pillowcases for a month.\\
227 - Okay...\\
228 - Fixing something?\\
229 - Dad.\\
230 - Hi.\\
231 - I'm so disappointed in you, son.\\
232 - We had an agreement.\\
233 - What was that?\\
234 - What was what?\\
235 - All right, we both have a problem.\\
236 - This is so degrading.\\
237 - On the way home from school, I almost pulled a cigarette butt out of the gutter.\\
238 - I French-kissed your mother this morning just to lick the coffee off her teeth.\\
239 - But we can do this. We just need to find a way to divert our minds when the pangs get too bad.\\
240 - Hal, what are you doing?\\
241 - What's it look like I'm doing?\\
242 - Can't a father have a friendly game of catch with his son?!\\
243 - We're having fun!\\
244 - I had that dream again last night.\\
245 - Cheerleading tryouts.\\
246 - Like it wasn't bad enough it happened, I have to relive it for the rest of my life.\\
247 - I was so excited to think that I might be a Cougar,\\
248 - and finally feel like I belonged.\\
249 - The routine was nothing, I'd done that stuff in gymnastics for years.\\
250 - And still, I practiced that routine for weeks making sure that it was perfect.\\
251 - The day of the tryouts, I borrowed my sister's good sweater,\\
252 - spent about an hour on my hair, stuffed my bra, even shoved a little extra in there for luck.\\
253 - And when I got down to the gym, I found out I had to go first,\\
254 - in front of the whole squad and everyone else who was trying out.\\
255 - So I just pretended to be braver than I was.\\
256 - I smiled real big, and I went out there and I started my routine.\\
257 - I did a round-off, a cartwheel, a kip-up, it was going great, I was so happy.\\
258 - I landed my back-flip dead solid perfect. I threw up my arms, and instead of everybody cheering...\\
259 - everybody was laughing.\\
260 - And I looked down, and there was a 30-foot-long trail of toilet paper along the tumbling mat.\\
261 - Everything I worked for, everything I wanted so desperately...\\
262 - ruined because of my vanity.\\
263 - And you know what the worst part is?\\
264 - I didn't even learn anything.\\
265 - Deep down, I'm still just as shallow as I was then.\\
266 - All that fussing and primping and time I wasted to shut out laughter that stopped 30 years ago.\\
267 - It's disgusting.\\
268 - If I had any guts I would just cut off my hair right now.\\
269 - You know, just face it down, and beat it!\\
270 - You gonna get that?\\
271 - I can't.\\
272 - Malcolm. It's Abe.\\
273 - Where's your brother?\\
274 - Reese? I don't know, probably pounding the snot out of someone.\\
275 - It's Stevie!\\
276 - -You've got to stop it! -What?\\
277 - What are you talking about?\\
278 - Stevie and I were in the middle of our session at the Norvet Institute,\\
279 - and then he said he had to go fight Reese, and just took off!\\
280 - -I'm terrified that... -Oh, no.\\
281 - Reese, what are you doing?\\
282 - Something I should've done years ago.\\
283 - I've been numbing my legs in ice for an hour now.\\
284 - What?\\
285 - I can't feel a thing down there.\\
286 - See? Nothing.\\
287 - First three times I did that it hurt like hell.\\
288 - Nobody's gonna say this wasn't a fair fight.\\
289 - When Stevie gets here, I'm gonna flop over to him like a fish,\\
290 - yank him out of his chair, and smash his face in, gimp-to-gimp.\\
291 - Reese, you're insane!\\
292 - Am I?\\
293 - They thought Einstein was crazy... until he started kicking ass.\\
294 - Hey. Where's Mom?\\
295 - She's locked in her room with Jamie. She's been there for hours.\\
296 - Oh. Listen, I'm sorry I snapped at you. I was just agitated, but I'm feeling better now.\\
297 - Hey, I really think we're over the hump.\\
298 - We're still a team, okay?\\
299 - Good boy.\\
300 - What are you doing?!\\
301 - What?\\
302 - Oh, this. It's nothing.\\
303 - It's keeping me calm.\\
304 - But we're quitting!\\
305 - No, I'm quitting coffee.\\
306 - You're quitting cigarettes.\\
307 - That's cheating!\\
308 - You do not get to do this.\\
309 - Actually, Dewey, I get to do whatever I want, because I am a grown-up.\\
310 - All right, if that's how you want it.\\
311 - Dewey!\\
312 - What are you doing?\\
313 - Dewey!\\
314 - Don't you dare!\\
315 - The smooth, wonderful taste of betrayal!\\
316 - Oh, yeah?\\
317 - Well, I'm in flavor country, baby!\\
318 - This is good.\\
319 - This is growth.\\
320 - Just do it.\\
321 - Don't be such a chicken.\\
322 - It's the only way to stop hearing it.\\
323 - All those kids laughing, my mother coming to the nurse's office telling me to stop blubbering,\\
324 - she wouldn't have to stuff my bra if I wasn't too lazy to grow them myself.\\
325 - Oh, my God.\\
326 - It was my mother.\\
327 - She was the one stuffing my bra. Oh, my God.\\
328 - She was the one making me feel so horrible and inadequate. Not me.\\
329 - This wasn't about vanity, Jamie.\\
330 - This is about an abusive old bat trying to make her kid into something that she wasn't.\\
331 - Well, I am not going to be that kind of mother.\\
332 - If you don't feel like talking yet, then you don't have to talk.\\
333 - I'm going to love you exactly the way you are.\\
334 - Shut up!\\
335 - Mm. Rich, roasted goodness!\\
336 - Suddenly I'm at a French cafe.\\
337 - Well, I'm with two girls in a speedboat, sucking down a smooth blend of fine tobaccos.\\
338 - Hal!\\
339 - Dewey's drinking coffee!\\
340 - I think crippling my legs made my arms stronger.\\
341 - Like how blind guys have bigger noses.\\
342 - This is gonna be great.\\
343 - Reese, you can't do this. Stevie's our friend.\\
344 - Hey, he's not my friend. He's your friend.\\
345 - He treats me like crap.\\
346 - He insults me and disrespects me...\\
347 - and you let him.\\
348 - What?\\
349 - You always take his side. You always do everything his way, even though we're brothers.\\
350 - Wait. Are you jealous?\\
351 - No, I'm pissed.\\
352 - You and Stevie are going to be friends your whole life,\\
353 - but once you go away to college and you're not stuck with us,\\
354 - we're never gonna see you again.\\
355 - But even so, you're spending the rest of the time left with Stevie instead of...\\
356 - Do I have to tell you I love you?\\
357 - No.\\
358 - Good.\\
359 - Dude, like you said, we're brothers.\\
360 - It doesn't matter if I don't want to be here, I'm stuck here.\\
361 - No matter where I go or what I do, we're always going to be forced together.\\
362 - Christmas, birthdays...\\
363 - We're going to be forced to be around each other for the rest of our lives.\\
364 - Really?\\
365 - What was that?\\
366 - I don't know.\\
367 - You're... mine!\\
368 - Good news, Stevie. I forgive you.\\
369 - Come on, Stevie!\\
370 - I can't walk. This isn't fair!\\
371 - Don't reduce yourself to my level!\\
372 - You're better than this!\\
373 - God, I'm too late!\\
374 - Stevie, please stop!\\
375 - Think of the lawsuit!\\
376 - You know these people will do anything to get our money!\\
377 - The Norvet Institute kicked Stevie out of their program for unauthorized use of their equipment.\\
378 - And Reese will be okay, but he's not allowed out of bed until he stops seeing four of everything.\\
379 - Mom's making Dad find every last one of his old cigarettes.\\
380 - She's going to make him eat any she finds tomorrow morning, so he's pretty motivated.\\
381 - The amazing thing is I'm the only one that got off scott-free.\\
382 - Malcolm, go change Reese's bedpan.\\
383 - Hey. He's my brother.
\subsection {Episode 04: Halloween}
1 - Dr. Baxter's Corvette?\\
2 - Mrs. Smith's mini-van.\\
3 - I want to savor the moment.\\
4 - Malcolm in the Middle - 7.07 - "Blackout" Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script par Raceman. Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
5 - Have you seen Malcolm?\\
6 - No! And you haven't either.\\
7 - -I haven't. -Good.\\
8 - Then we understand each other.\\
9 - And you're going to make yourself scarce tonight.\\
10 - But I'm cooking.\\
11 - Mom and Dad are going out for their anniversary and they're letting me pick dinner.\\
12 - I'm not eating cereal for dinner!\\
13 - Yes, you are.\\
14 - Dad said if I emptied out the rat traps in the crawl space, then I get to pick dinner.\\
15 - That's funny.\\
16 - He didn't consult me, seeing as I have the fist and you have the face.\\
17 - Reese says I don't get to pick dinner.\\
18 - He's right, you don't.\\
19 - Change of plans. Your mother and I are celebrating our anniversary at home. We're having steaks.\\
20 - No fair!\\
21 - I wiped up rat brains!\\
22 - You promised!\\
23 - Dewey, if I kept half the promises I made, this family would plunge into chaos.\\
24 - You come with me now.\\
25 - I didn't do anything!\\
26 - What's going on?\\
27 - Kobe.\\
28 - What?\\
29 - I have Kobe beef.\\
30 - -No way. -Yes!\\
31 - That's like $60 an ounce.\\
32 - I know. I won it in a Minesweeper tournament at work.\\
33 - Years of practicing eight hours a day has finally paid off.\\
34 - I've never even seen Kobe beef.\\
35 - It's like meeting the Pope, but you get to eat him.\\
36 - Exactly. But this is treated much better than any pope was or ever will be.\\
37 - It lives on beer and ice cream.\\
38 - And right up until the moment of slaughter, its rump and thighs are massaged by geishas.\\
39 - It should be eating us.\\
40 - There's only two.\\
41 - One for me... one for the chef.\\
42 - You are the only person in this family qualified to cook up these babies.\\
43 - This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\\
44 - Mom doesn't get any on her anniversary?\\
45 - You didn't hear me.\\
46 - Once in a lifetime.\\
47 - I've had 22 anniversaries.\\
48 - I'm telling your mother I screwed up the reservations and we're having a steak dinner at home.\\
49 - You cook up these next to the prison-grade crap that I'm giving the rest of the family.\\
50 - Where's Malcolm?\\
51 - I have no idea where Malcolm is or what he's doing...\\
52 - Or why he's doing whatever it is that I don't know what he's doing.\\
53 - All right, I know you're hiding something, but I don't care.\\
54 - No, no, Jamie, I don't want anyone to know I'm here.\\
55 - Look...\\
56 - Here's a toy.\\
57 - See? Fun.\\
58 - Hello?\\
59 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
60 - <b>6:42 pm PARENTS' BEDROOM</b>\\
61 - -Hal! -I paid the bill.\\
62 - It's the whole neighborhood.\\
63 - See?\\
64 - God wants our evil plan to work.\\
65 - Go.\\
66 - Hal! I can't see anything!\\
67 - I'll find a flashlight.\\
68 - Oh, would you look at that.\\
69 - Is there a single neighbor that lends us something that doesn't have dead batteries?\\
70 - -What was that? -I'll check.\\
71 - Maybe an emboldened possum.\\
72 - Francis!\\
73 - Mom.\\
74 - What are you doing here?\\
75 - I... need a bandage.\\
76 - I tripped over something in the garage, when the lights went out.\\
77 - What were you doing in the garage?\\
78 - I was hiding from Dad. I wanted to talk to you first.\\
79 - Francis, your father and I have a joint checking account. It doesn't matter who you talk to first.\\
80 - No, it's just... you know how emotional he gets. I don't want him overreacting when he hears what happened.\\
81 - What happened?\\
82 - I think my marriage is over.\\
83 - -That's bad news. -Of course it is.\\
84 - What's going on?\\
85 - We've been fighting about everything lately.\\
86 - I mean, how do you answer when someone asks, "Does your face have to look like that?"\\
87 - I put up with her face.\\
88 - With that nose always pointing at me.\\
89 - Oh, Francis...\\
90 - I still love her; I don't want it to end, but I just... I don't see how it's going to last.\\
91 - Lois, can you come out here? I need you.\\
92 - Just don't tell Dad, okay?\\
93 - He'll be a mess and I'll end up having to take care of him.\\
94 - Okay, I'll get your father out of the way and then you and I can talk later.\\
95 - Francis, I'm so glad you're here.\\
96 - Dad promised we'd all have cereal for dinner tonight, and now he won't let us.\\
97 - Dewey, I understand.\\
98 - And I swear to you by all that is holy that you will be eating cereal tonight.\\
99 - You can count on me.\\
100 - You're not going to do anything, are you?\\
101 - No, I'm not.\\
102 - But I'll tell you what I will do.\\
103 - If you let anyone know I'm here, I will punch you so hard in the stomach,\\
104 - you won't be able to eat cereal for two days.\\
105 - There. Problem solved.\\
106 - The bedroom, where you, Hal, are headed right now.\\
107 - Where did that come from?\\
108 - I'm just trying to celebrate our anniversary.\\
109 - Not just yet.\\
110 - I still have some work to do.\\
111 - Officer, what is this about?\\
112 - You better lock the doors.\\
113 - Actually, Hal, you know, on second thought, I'm really not in the mood.\\
114 - Oh, I see.\\
115 - Stoke the flame.\\
116 - Oh, I like the way you think.\\
117 - Hello?\\
118 - Malcolm! For God sakes, we've been looking all over for you.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Wait, slow down. I can't understand what you're saying.\\
121 - Are you drunk?\\
122 - -You are drunk! -Who's drunk?\\
123 - Malcolm. He's drunk at a party 100 miles down the freeway.\\
124 - Now we both have to go down there, pick him up and drive his car back.\\
125 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
126 - You know what would teach him a lesson?\\
127 - If we made him wait until after we ate dinner.\\
128 - Let him stew in his own juices.\\
129 - His own delicious, savory juices.\\
130 - Get your keys, Hal. I'll meet you in the car.\\
131 - All right!\\
132 - Malcolm... you just stay right where you are.\\
133 - I hate children.\\
134 - So clever.\\
135 - It'll take them two hours on the highway, an hour to figure out I'm not there and then two hours back.\\
136 - So I'd say I have about five hours left to live.\\
137 - How about we make it worthwhile?\\
138 - -That stupid fish! -Malcolm!\\
139 - Crap!\\
140 - -Malcolm! -Crap!\\
141 - Hello?\\
142 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
143 - <b>6:42 pm THE BACKYARD</b>\\
144 - There it is. Sweet!\\
145 - This is going to solve all my problems.\\
146 - Piama. Hi, baby.\\
147 - I found it.\\
148 - It is even more beautiful than I remember.\\
149 - I'm going to grab it and go. They won't even know I was here. I love you.\\
150 - Jamie, go get the stick.\\
151 - Jamie...\\
152 - Oh, did the blackout scare you?\\
153 - Listen, pal, I need the batteries from one of your toys.\\
154 - Where's that frog that used to shock you in the bathtub?\\
155 - Hey, Lois, can you come out here? I need you.\\
156 - What's this? I thought we were going out for our anniversary.\\
157 - Honey, this is going to be even better.\\
158 - We are going to stay home and have Kobe beef.\\
159 - Okay, I thought you'd be a little excited.\\
160 - Ah, I'm sorry, Hal. I'm just a little lost in thought.\\
161 - A friend at work is having, um...\\
162 - marital problems.\\
163 - And that's very sad.\\
164 - But we are going to have Kobe beef.\\
165 - Reese is going to prepare its flesh perfectly because he thinks he's going to get some to eat.\\
166 - But he's not.\\
167 - Isn't that great?\\
168 - -That's a good scheme. -You bet it's a good scheme.\\
169 - -Do you know where my apron is? -I washed it, it's in the bedroom closet.\\
170 - The bedroom.\\
171 - Where you, Hal, are headed right now.\\
172 - Where did that come from?\\
173 - I'm just trying to celebrate our anniversary.\\
174 - Francis!\\
175 - Mom.\\
176 - I don't have a lot of time and I want to talk to you about your marriage.\\
177 - Oh, yeah, great.\\
178 - I'd love to hear what you have to say.\\
179 - Have you and Piama thought about, uh...\\
180 - spicing things up?\\
181 - What?\\
182 - Francis, if it isn't right in the bedroom, it isn't going to be right anywhere else.\\
183 - What?\\
184 - When I say "the bedroom," I mean sex.\\
185 - Yeah, I got it.\\
186 - Francis, marriage isn't mental.\\
187 - It isn't even really about feelings.\\
188 - When you get  right down to it, it's a sloppy, sweaty physical act.\\
189 - Now, your father may have flaws,he may not make a lot of money,\\
190 - but he has never been other than a rigorous and challenging lover.\\
191 - Mom...\\
192 - Can I be frank with you?\\
193 - No!\\
194 - Do you remember sometimes in the morning I'd forget to put juice in your lunchbox?\\
195 - I was lucky I could remember my own name.\\
196 - Because, when your father gets down to work, and is intimate with me, he is like a skilled general invading a country.\\
197 - He doesn't just launch an assault by sea, he uses paratroopers and columns of infantry.\\
198 - And even secret agents.\\
199 - Honey, good for you. Get it all out.\\
200 - We can talk more later.\\
201 - -I'm willing to propose a compromise. -Dewey, give it up.\\
202 - You'll never get anything you want.\\
203 - We have to get rid of Mom and Dad.\\
204 - -Don't worry about it. -I am worried about it.\\
205 - Those Dutch girls won't hold forever.\\
206 - Dutch girls! No!\\
207 - Stay, Dutch girls, stay!\\
208 - We didn't have fun.\\
209 - American parties are supposed to have deejays and African-Americans.\\
210 - I'll get you those.\\
211 - We are leaving.\\
212 - If we wanted to be bored, we could go to Luxembourg.\\
213 - You can't go.\\
214 - While you were in there, a rock star called and said he's going to come over.\\
215 - We don't blame you for our bitter disappointment.\\
216 - We don't know how to overcome your country's Puritan heritage.\\
217 - I can learn!\\
218 - Teach me!\\
219 - Good-bye.\\
220 - No, no, no, please, don't leave.\\
221 - I'll lose face.\\
222 - In American culture, if I say I'm throwing a party and my guests leave, then I'm humiliated.\\
223 - And I have to prove myself in combat against the mayor.\\
224 - I might die.\\
225 - We know your story's a load of crap, but we think you're cute. We'll stay.\\
226 - But if we are not drunk in 20 minutes, we are leaving.\\
227 - Thank you so much for being reasonable. Just go back in my room and stay out of sight.\\
228 - This won't take long, I promise.\\
229 - Dude, I can't believe you admitted you're afraid to fight the mayor.\\
230 - What are we going to do about Mom and Dad?\\
231 - I've got it covered.\\
232 - How?\\
233 - Let's just say that since people started getting prescription drugs in the mail, it's opened a whole new world of possibility.\\
234 - Remember when Dad took away my GameBoy and then he fell asleep at work and he thought he was going to be fired?\\
235 - Tuna salad with cumin and allergy medicine.\\
236 - Reese, do you know how crazy and dangerous that is?\\
237 - Even you wouldn't poison your own family.\\
238 - No? Malcolm, last month, when you thought your watch skipped from Wednesday to Friday...\\
239 - it wasn't the watch.\\
240 - Okay, I've got a plan that isn't insane.\\
241 - I'll make a call to get them out of the house.\\
242 - Oh, here comes Dad. Just keep him occupied.\\
243 - How are the coals looking?\\
244 - Almost ready.\\
245 - Oh, okay. Let me know.\\
246 - -Dad, wait. -What?\\
247 - Where do babies come from?\\
248 - Reese, I'm sure we've talked about this.\\
249 - Yeah, but I'm blanking.\\
250 - Two guys, right?\\
251 - You know, we can talk about this later.\\
252 - You better get that phone. It sounds like it's for you.\\
253 - I hate children.\\
254 - Francis? Francis?\\
255 - I had another thought for you and Piama ballroom dancing.\\
256 - Oh, that sounds great, Mom. But you know, your advice from earlier,\\
257 - it really helped out, so I think we're going to be cool.\\
258 - -That stupid fish?! -Malcolm!\\
259 - Crap!\\
260 - -That stupid fish?! -Malcolm!\\
261 - Crap!\\
262 - Hello?\\
263 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
264 - <b>6:42 pm THE KITCHEN</b>\\
265 - Come on. Follow me, this way.\\
266 - Movies are wrong.\\
267 - America is not a fun country.\\
268 - The public transportation is underfunded and you can't drink beer in the library, and now the lights are out.\\
269 - This country's also full of lying fathers who say you can have cereal and then make you eat steak.\\
270 - I promise you, you'll have fun.\\
271 - Dewey, shut up and get lost!\\
272 - If you understood our culture better, there's no way you'd be here.\\
273 - It's not going to work.\\
274 - Mom and Dad aren't going anywhere. We're going to have to do this another night.\\
275 - There is no other night. They're going home tomorrow.\\
276 - But there is a blackout.\\
277 - What are we supposed to do with a bunch of Dutch girls in the dark?\\
278 - These girls are from Amsterdam.\\
279 - They don't even have a word for virginity there.\\
280 - Is there a high-speed train available to take us to a "juke joint"?\\
281 - We wish to experience typical American culture.\\
282 - And you will.\\
283 - This is a very important part of American culture.\\
284 - Which is getting the parents out of the house.\\
285 - You know, teenage hijinks.\\
286 - In Holland, parents enjoy for children to have pleasure.\\
287 - I know, it's crazy. And yet, we rule the world.\\
288 - Okay, Malcolm, your arrogant American attitude has charmed us.\\
289 - -There will be alcohol? -I promise.\\
290 - You just go and wait in our room and we'll get it all sorted out.\\
291 - I get the easy-looking one on the left.\\
292 - We all speak English.\\
293 - I know.\\
294 - Come on, come on. Let's go.\\
295 - Just because it's drugs, doesn't mean it has to taste bad.\\
296 - I hate children.\\
297 - I can't believe it.\\
298 - Your mother and I, well, all of us, really are missing the greatest beef in the world because your brother Malcolm is drunk!\\
299 - He's not drunk, Dad.\\
300 - -He's hiding under his bed with Dutch girls. -Don't cover for him!\\
301 - Malcolm, you're such a big man when you're getting drunk to impress your friends.\\
302 - But when it's time to drive home and take your punishment, it's "Oh, Daddy, come save me."\\
303 - -That stupid fish! -Malcolm!\\
304 - Crap!\\
305 - You're here!\\
306 - Kinda.\\
307 - You lied to me. You're not drunk at all!\\
308 - You lied to me. You're not getting divorced.\\
309 - Sorry.\\
310 - You sold out your wife and your marriage and got me all...\\
311 - -Excited, Mom? -No. Upset.\\
312 - All so you could steal your father's fish!\\
313 - You can't steal what belongs to you. I reeled it in for five hours.\\
314 - He just swooped in at the last moment and gaffed it.\\
315 - You said if I ever called and said I was drunk I wouldn't get in trouble.\\
316 - That only applies if you're actually drunk!\\
317 - That was ten years ago! Why do you even care?\\
318 - -It was between me and some guys. -What guys?\\
319 - They come around the pool, every day at 3:00, talking smack like all I do is hang around at the pool all day and I never did anything with my life.\\
320 - So I told 'em about the fish.\\
321 - And they said they didn't believe me!\\
322 - Man, I can't wait to see the look on Jason Sullivan's face!\\
323 - 3:00? How old are these people?\\
324 - Good point.\\
325 - A 12-year-old should not be lecturing people about how they have or have not lived their lives!\\
326 - -You're trying to impress a 12-year-old? -Not trying to, going to.\\
327 - I don't want this dead fish in my house. You can have it.\\
328 - But once I help you, you know what you have to do.\\
329 - Learn not to care what other people think?\\
330 - Get a job!\\
331 - Yeah, that'll show 'em.\\
332 - I am going to decide your punishment on a full stomach, Malcolm.\\
333 - Malcolm?\\
334 - Francis?\\
335 - -You lied about being drunk? -What are you doing with my fish?\\
336 - Dinner!\\
337 - I don't know where you get it, the dishonesty. We are your family, and you betray us.\\
338 - God, this is so good, Reese.\\
339 - Thanks.\\
340 - Malcolm, I would like to reach into your ear and tear out that part of your brain that makes you do things like this!\\
341 - -Smoky. -That's the mesquite.\\
342 - I don't even know what's happening in my own house.\\
343 - Really good, Reese.\\
344 - Hey, thanks for your piece, Dewey. You sure you don't want any?\\
345 - No, thanks.\\
346 - That is so nice of you, Dewey.\\
347 - At least we have one boy we can trust.\\
348 - I taste?\\
349 - You don't want that.\\
350 - Reese made this special sleeping sauce for Mom and Dad,\\
351 - but I thought the whole family deserved some.\\
352 - A typical American dinner, no?\\
353 - A special American dinner.\\
354 - Lucky Charms?\\
355 - Danke.\\
356 - Mm, the frosted moons and stars are both magic and also delicious.\\
357 - I can't believe they promised it to you and then just tried to take it back.\\
358 - Forget about them.\\
359 - Let's just enjoy our time together.
\subsection {Episode 05: Jessica Stays Over}
1 - Give me the candy bar.\\
2 - You heard me, Jamie. Give it.\\
3 - Where is it?\\
4 - Where'd it go?\\
5 - Wow, I was five before I got Reese to fall for that.\\
6 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.05 - "Jessica Stays Over"\\
7 - Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
8 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
9 - Sorry.\\
10 - I didn't... Sorry.\\
11 - It's no big deal, Malcolm. You know, one day you will be old enough to shave.\\
12 - -Go. -Oh...\\
13 - Yeah, okay.\\
14 - That's Jessica, our neighbor.\\
15 - Mom and Dad are letting her sleep on our couch for a week until her father's arraigned.\\
16 - Seems he got drunk Friday night, decided to track down her mom and tried to drive a street-sweeper to Mexico.\\
17 - She has some family issues.\\
18 - Malcolm, Reese, Jessica, let's go.\\
19 - -What are you doing? -Are you kidding?\\
20 - No way I'm letting Jessica get a look at the goods.\\
21 - What is taking you boys so long?\\
22 - Tell Sasquatch in there to give us a shot at the bathroom.\\
23 - Hey, Mom, can I borrow your car tonight? Frank Miller's signing his new graphic novel...\\
24 - You're going to drive it the way you threw your pants in a wad behind the hamper yesterday?\\
25 - I don't think so.\\
26 - What?\\
27 - How does her mind even form thoughts like that?\\
28 - Is that a bee?\\
29 - That is how you know it's fresh.\\
30 - You won't find any bees in your store-bought honey, I'll tell you that much.\\
31 - -Where did this come from? -Spoils of war, Dewey.\\
32 - You know that beehive in the toolshed I've been battling for months?\\
33 - Victory is mine.\\
34 - You did it yourself?\\
35 - How'd you know how to do that?\\
36 - It's instinctual.\\
37 - See, human beings were born with everything they need to destroy bees.\\
38 - Except the poison, you have to buy that.\\
39 - I feel kind of sorry for the bees, though.\\
40 - It's survival of the fittest, Dewey.\\
41 - If they had won, they'd be spreading us on toast right now.\\
42 - Big deal.\\
43 - So I don't get the car to go to the book signing.\\
44 - Meeting your heroes is always such a disappointment, anyway.\\
45 - Hi, Malcolm.\\
46 - You got the car?\\
47 - How'd you get the car?\\
48 - I just had a little shopping to do, and your mom insisted I take the car.\\
49 - What do you mean she insisted?\\
50 - I've been begging her for weeks. Every time I ask, she says no.\\
51 - That's where you made your mistake.\\
52 - I just got all vulnerable and poured on stuff about my dad.\\
53 - It was easy.\\
54 - No way.\\
55 - Look, Malcolm, it's not something I'm proud of, believe me.\\
56 - It's how I've learned to survive in my twisted family.\\
57 - They're like a total cesspool of manipulation and emotional blackmail.\\
58 - Everyone screwing everyone over.\\
59 - I don't even know a true, honest way to connect with people anymore.\\
60 - It's sick.\\
61 - I'm sick!\\
62 - Jessica, wait.\\
63 - I'm sorry.\\
64 - Ah, thanks for carrying my bags for me, Malcolm.\\
65 - Told you it was easy.\\
66 - You can bite my American ass, Zhao Lee.\\
67 - What's that?\\
68 - The school made us adopt pen pals from different countries.\\
69 - I got stuck with this loser from China.\\
70 - -What's wrong with China? -It's not what you think, Dewey.\\
71 - He won't send you illegal fireworks or get your nunchucks autographed by the emperor.\\
72 - The guy's a total jerk.\\
73 - It started off with a simple request to apologize for Pearl Harbor.\\
74 - The guy wouldn't do it.\\
75 - He's so arrogant. When I draw squiggles, it's nonsense.\\
76 - When he does it, it's a language.\\
77 - I was so pissed.\\
78 - But then I thought, be the better man, and reason with the guy.\\
79 - "Do you want me to kick your butt?\\
80 - Check yes or no."\\
81 - And there's his response. He couldn't even follow simple instructions.\\
82 - "You need help, Reese."\\
83 - He thinks a whole planet between us is going to protect him.\\
84 - He thinks he's so smart.\\
85 - We'll see who's smart when I mail myself to China and kick him upside-down ass.\\
86 - What?\\
87 - Reese, that's crazy.\\
88 - Name one thing that's crazy about it.\\
89 - You're right. I take it back.\\
90 - I can't wait to see his face when he opens up his mail and I pop out.\\
91 - And how are you supposed to get back after you beat him up?\\
92 - Dewey, you know nothing about Asian culture.\\
93 - After I humiliate him, I earn his respect, plus half his land and his sister, if she's hot.\\
94 - All I got to do is stay off of Mom's radar for the next three days.\\
95 - You call this clean?\\
96 - I have to say, Mom, if you're just going to phone it in, why even bother?\\
97 - You just bought yourself two days grounded in your room.\\
98 - Fine.\\
99 - Maybe you can use that time to learn how to roll socks.\\
100 - Make it three days. You want to try for more?\\
101 - Nope. Three's perfect.\\
102 - Hey, survivor, huh?\\
103 - I guess you weren't around when Uncle Hal came a-knockin'.\\
104 - Oh, all right, all right. Let it go.\\
105 - War's over.\\
106 - All right, knock it off!\\
107 - I mean it!\\
108 - Back off!\\
109 - I'm warning you!\\
110 - Your friends died like cowards.\\
111 - What's wrong with you?\\
112 - Nothing. I'm fine.\\
113 - Aw, this crisper is disgusting. It's like vegetable soup in there.\\
114 - Malcolm, get a sponge and clean it out.\\
115 - Okay.\\
116 - You're not going to fight me or try to weasel out of it?\\
117 - All right, what's wrong?\\
118 - Nothing. It's just...\\
119 - -There's this math test coming up, and... I don't know... -Malcolm, stop.\\
120 - You're going to ace it like you always do.\\
121 - That's just the point. You totally expect me to get a hundred.\\
122 - My teacher expects me to get a hundred. Everyone expects me to get a hundred.\\
123 - Do ynow what it's like every time you do anything in school to have everyone expect you to be perfect?\\
124 - Do you have any idea what kind of pressure that puts on you?\\
125 - It was so easy.\\
126 - I started with this load of crap about my math test and then the rest just came pouring out of me so naturally.\\
127 - Before I knew it she was telling me to take the car and go and have fun with my friends.\\
128 - She even gave me money for gas.\\
129 - Nice.\\
130 - Is that a tear?\\
131 - No.\\
132 - Six boxes of cereal, two gallons of milk, eight peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, adult diapers and Madlibs.\\
133 - You thought of everything.\\
134 - And I also packed some barbells so I can get there in fighting shape.\\
135 - -They look like soup cans. -You noticed.\\
136 - See, there's a lot of things that serve two purs.\\
137 - Like my pillow.\\
138 - It's stuffed with M&M's so I can sleep and snack from the same source.\\
139 - It's the same way NASA designed the old space capsules.\\
140 - The very same.\\
141 - And you'll be ready with the tapes to cover with Mom, right?\\
142 - -Yeah. -All right, let's get moving.\\
143 - I want to be at the post office for the 4:00 pick-up.\\
144 - Should I get you stamped "fragile"?\\
145 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
146 - And the journey begins.\\
147 - Malcolm, you wouldn't happen to know the life expectancy of a bee, would you?\\
148 - -I don't know. -Great.\\
149 - What's the point of hauling around that giant head of yours if you can't retain a few simple facts?\\
150 - Hal, he gets enough pressure from school without his family piling on.\\
151 - Did Mom just defend me?\\
152 - Wow, this vulnerability crap is more effective than I thought.\\
153 - Reese's eggs are stone cold.\\
154 - Dewey, you can bring them to him now.\\
155 - It's about time, butt-munch.\\
156 - She actually expects me to eat this slop?\\
157 - Hal... what are you doing home? It's 10:15.\\
158 - It's that bee, Lois.\\
159 - He attacked me again on my way to the car.\\
160 - I barely made it back in here.\\
161 - The damn thing won't leave me alone.\\
162 - -He's on some crazy vendetta. -Hal!\\
163 - Okay, maybe it's not that crazy when you think about it.\\
164 - I mean, I did kill all his family and friends and basically destroyed his whole world.\\
165 - That's got to come as a blow.\\
166 - Hal, you have got to go to work.\\
167 - I know, you're right.\\
168 - This is absurd.\\
169 - Okay.\\
170 - Here's the plan, Lois.\\
171 - I am going to move very casually toward the back door and draw his attention over there.\\
172 - Once he's diverted, you run lickety-split to my car and drive it right up here to the side doors.\\
173 - Honk the horn. Two short beeps, then one long. I'll count to three we'll open the doors simultaneously.\\
174 - You've got to be kidding me.\\
175 - Hey, I am not going to let some bee run my life.\\
176 - -Where are you going? -Rick Kessler's party.\\
177 - How you getting there?\\
178 - I'm going to tell my mom how I can't beat people's expectations on my science test.\\
179 - Are you a complete moron?\\
180 - What?\\
181 - Amateurs.\\
182 - You are not trying to manipulate a guy here, Malcolm.\\
183 - -You have to use your brain. -But it worked great last time.\\
184 - Which is why you can never use it again. Especially with your mom's radar.\\
185 - Come on, sit down, listen to me.\\
186 - You got lucky the first time.\\
187 - But if you want to pull this off, getting the car two nights in a row, you have to be very, very good.\\
188 - -Why can't I just... -Hey!\\
189 - Do you want to ride Jamie's Big Wheel to the party?\\
190 - I am telling you, you have to share some real fear or feeling of inadequacy.\\
191 - If you are not totally honest, she will see right through your scam.\\
192 - Okay.\\
193 - So, like what?\\
194 - Well, I don't know. What do you got?\\
195 - Well, I, uh...\\
196 - Come on, Malcolm, your biggest problem is choosing one.\\
197 - Okay, well, I'm not that tall.\\
198 - -That's what you're going with? -I don't know. This is hard.\\
199 - We'll go down the list and see which one makes you feel the most uncomfortable.\\
200 - We've established that you're short.\\
201 - Yeah.\\
202 - And pretty scrawny.\\
203 - Yeah.\\
204 - And completely self-absorbed.\\
205 - Yeah.\\
206 - With huge mother issues.\\
207 - Yeah.\\
208 - You don't really put out a sexual vibe.\\
209 - -Hey! -Bingo.\\
210 - It was amazing. We've never really talked like that.\\
211 - She said she felt like a total outcast in high school.\\
212 - She told me all this stuff.\\
213 - Like really personal stuff, but it didn't feel creepy like your mom's telling you stuff.\\
214 - It was more like we were equals.\\
215 - It was great.\\
216 - Good work.\\
217 - Did you get the car?\\
218 - What?\\
219 - Oh, yeah.\\
220 - You know, I think I'm going to skip the party.\\
221 - -You're kidding. -Yeah, I don't know, I just...\\
222 - I don't really feel like going out.\\
223 - You know what?\\
224 - I think I'm going to stay home and start a journal.\\
225 - Stupid jet engine.\\
226 - Why don't you learn how to fly this stupid thing?!\\
227 - Oh, sure, I feel lonely.\\
228 - Sometimes even with my family all around me, I feel like there's this...\\
229 - I don't know, this-this gulf between us that I can't get across and maybe don't even want to.\\
230 - -Does that sound awful? -No, no. I know exactly what you're talking about.\\
231 - There's this deep chasm of loneliness, but the weird thing is, it's...\\
232 - it's not all that horrible.\\
233 - It's almost like this...\\
234 - -This... -Sweet pain?\\
235 - Oh, my God.\\
236 - I thought I was the only one who felt that way.\\
237 - Well, it's not something I really talk about. I can't believe I'm even telling you.\\
238 - Don't worry, Mom. I... I understand. I really do.\\
239 - Oh, look at the time. Malcolm, we've gabbed the whole morning away. I got to get dressed for work.\\
240 - Go ahead. I'll finish the dishes.\\
241 - I m gonna take you up on that.\\
242 - That was genius.\\
243 - Jessica?\\
244 - -You were there the whole time? -Seriously, that was awesome.\\
245 - What are you going for?\\
246 - What? Nothing.\\
247 - Malcolm, it's me.\\
248 - What are you after? I mean you've got her opening up to you. Forget about the car.\\
249 - With that level of intimacy, I'd shoot for a laptop.\\
250 - We were just talking about things we felt.\\
251 - Wow, Malcolm, that's really...\\
252 - -Pathetic. -Shut up.\\
253 - Listen, Monday I need you to get your mom out of the house for a couple of hours after school.\\
254 - Take her to a chick flick or something.\\
255 - You should enjoy that.\\
256 - What for?\\
257 - My boyfriend's coming over, and I'd like to have the house to ourselves, if you know what I mean.\\
258 - What?!\\
259 - Oh, good, you do know what I mean.\\
260 - I wasn't sure with that whole chasm of loneliness crap.\\
261 - You can't hook up in my house.\\
262 - -I've never hooked up in my house. -Okay, Malcolm, it's your decision.\\
263 - Just a little worried how your mom might react when she finds out\\
264 - that the only reason you've been opening up to her is to get her car.\\
265 - That's not even true anymore.\\
266 - Anyway, you'd look just as bad.\\
267 - Malcolm, my dad's in jail, and I live on a couch.\\
268 - Looking bad isn't really a big motivator for me.\\
269 - Now, you owe me.\\
270 - You'd really do it, wouldn't you?\\
271 - Knowing me...\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - Fine, but I can't believe you're being like this.\\
274 - I thought you were helping me because you were my friend.\\
275 - Yeah, Malcolm?\\
276 - Save the girl talk for your mom.\\
277 - "Day 23.\\
278 - "I'm out of food, "but I've never felt so focused  and alive.\\
279 - I see everything now with crystal clarity that..."\\
280 - "Day 24.\\
281 - "I must be getting close.\\
282 - I can smell the docks."\\
283 - I know Mommy wanted us to go to the park.\\
284 - But why go outside where bad things want to hurt Daddy,\\
285 - when we can have just as much fun inside the house, right, Jamie?\\
286 - How about a nice shaving cream beard, huh?\\
287 - I did one last week at work, and everyone loved it.\\
288 - Don't worry, Jamie, it's me he's after, not you.\\
289 - Stop looking at me, Dewey.\\
290 - I'm not looking at you.\\
291 - Don't touch me.\\
292 - -I'm not touching you. -You're practically touching me.\\
293 - -Shut up. -You shut up.\\
294 - -Why don't you? -Why don't you make me?\\
295 - -Why don't you make me? -Maybe I will.\\
296 - He thinks he's on his way to China, and you've just been torturing him in that box?!\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - Can he breathe in there?\\
299 - He's still making noises.\\
300 - And he's got food and water?\\
301 - Yeah.\\
302 - All right.\\
303 - Honestly, Hal, I haven't felt this close to Malcolm since he was four years old.\\
304 - Did I tell you he's taking me to a movie tomorrow?\\
305 - I can't believe it.\\
306 - I mean, put out there, yon't know whether it'll ever come back to you.\\
307 - And then, when it does, it's wonderful.\\
308 - It's worth all the crap you have to put up with.\\
309 - Our boy is growing up, Lois.\\
310 - -I'm very proud of both of you. -Thanks, honey.\\
311 - -Can you turn off the smoke now? -In a minute.\\
312 - -How long do we have the place? -At least two hours.\\
313 - So, what do you want to do?\\
314 - -Jessica, I have to talk to you. -Malcolm, what are you doing here?\\
315 - -Where's Lois? -Still at the movies.\\
316 - I told her everything.\\
317 - I couldn't hold it back from her.\\
318 - We where in the lobby, and I saw something that reminded me of how much she really loves me.\\
319 - This mom was holding up her son so he could get a drink of water, and I thought,\\
320 - "What kind of Mom lets their kid drink from a public king fountain?"\\
321 - She would have yelled at me about all the germs, and I thought about how much she really cares about me, and I couldn't hold it back.\\
322 - -Malcolm, we'll talk about this later. -It was horrible.\\
323 - I tried to explain that getting close to her started off as a way to use her, but...\\
324 - It turned into something real.\\
325 - But she didn't care.\\
326 - She was just too hurt.\\
327 - She said she didn't want to look at me anymore.\\
328 - And then she walked right out of Autumn Encounter and straight into Body Count III.\\
329 - It's too bad, because Autumn Encounter looked really good.\\
330 - Can make myself a sandwich?\\
331 - Wait. Mike, this won't take long.\\
332 - My mom used to make me sandwiches.\\
333 - Now she'll never make me sandwiches again.\\
334 - Malcolm pull yourself together!\\
335 - This is kind of weird.\\
336 - Wait. Wait, Mike. Mike?\\
337 - Hi.\\
338 - Hi.\\
339 - I'm Mike, Jessica's friend.\\
340 - Dewey.\\
341 - Mind if I make myself a sandwich?\\
342 - I don't care.\\
343 - Wait, can you do me a favor first?\\
344 - There's this crate in the garage I can't get open.\\
345 - -You look really strong. -Sure.\\
346 - I bet you weren't expecting this, Zhao!\\
347 - Now you're gonna experience a good old American ass-whuppin'.\\
348 - Hey, quit it!\\
349 - I don't speak Chinese, jackass.\\
350 - All right.\\
351 - You!\\
352 - Okay, let's... stay calm.\\
353 - Let's not do anything stupid.\\
354 - Eat wind, honey sucker!\\
355 - This. Ends. Now.\\
356 - Is everything okay?\\
357 - Everything is just fine.\\
358 - Who's the idiot now?
\subsection {Episode 06: Secret Boyfriend}
1 - Here, I brought one for you.\\
2 - Thanks. And now I'll take yours because you obviously shook mine up.\\
3 - Wait a minute.\\
4 - You wanted me to do that.\\
5 - Of course, you had to have known I was going to know that.\\
6 - Unless you didn't think I was smart enough, but I'm smarter than...\\
7 - You know what? I'm not smart enough to figure it out.\\
8 - So what? Big deal.\\
9 - I'm not sure if I have the gift or he does.\\
10 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.06 - "Secret Boyfriend"\\
11 - Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
12 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
13 - Oh, great. I have Larry Neff as a lab partner; the groper.\\
14 - The experiment's going to be hard enough as it is without my lab partner trying to honk my boobs every five minutes.\\
15 - You think you've got it bad? I got stuck with Vicki Jarret.\\
16 - Brad, not again! You're hilarious!\\
17 - Okay, so she's totally hot.\\
18 - But I'm going to end up doing all the work by myself,\\
19 - which would be fine, but then she'll ask me to explain it.\\
20 - And then she'll just have to cry because the little bulb on top of her spine\\
21 - that she calls a brain will start to hurt, and then I'll end up looking like a jerk.\\
22 - Oh, come on, Malcolm. Give her a chance.\\
23 - Hey, maybe you two can come up with a new formula for lip gloss.\\
24 - Okay, you got your partners.\\
25 - Let's get started.\\
26 - Hi.\\
27 - Hi.\\
28 - I have a confession to make.\\
29 - I requested you as a lab partner.\\
30 - Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.\\
31 - Look, I'll walk you through the experiment, I'll do your homework,\\
32 - but I will not cheat on a test for you, okay?\\
33 - Fair enough.\\
34 - Okay.\\
35 - I'll dry the substrate and remove the ether on the evaporators.\\
36 - You, uh, want to wash the beakers? That's science, too.\\
37 - Come on, Malcolm, I am a part of the team.\\
38 - Vicki, believe me.\\
39 - I would let you help if I had any confidence that you knew what we were trying to do here.\\
40 - But all you do is sit in class and you giggle and whisper to your friends...\\
41 - Hand me the morpholino-cyclohexene, and you mix in the drydioxane with the methylvinylketone.\\
42 - Oh, my God, you're smart!\\
43 - Nobody needs to know that.\\
44 - I don't get it. Why do you need me to be your partner?\\
45 - Maybe I think you're cute.\\
46 - Anyway, it'd be nice to talk to someone about something deeper than the latest ringtone they downloaded.\\
47 - Most of my friends think...\\
48 - I know she's still talking, but I didn't hear anything after "I think you're cute."\\
49 - -Oh, for God's sake! -What is it?\\
50 - A notice for Reese to sign up for Career Day which was last Wednesday. He completely blew it off.\\
51 - What are we going to do with him, Hal? He shows absolutely no interest in his future.\\
52 - Sorry, honey, I thought you had given up on him, too.\\
53 - He doesn't go to school, he doesn't work. He's 18 years old, and he's still Reese.\\
54 - That is not acceptable.\\
55 - What are you going to do?\\
56 - Dad, I did it.\\
57 - I went to the Putt-Putt Palace and I beat your best golf score.\\
58 - Good for you, Dewey. Hey, let's have a look.\\
59 - Four in The Witch's Den. Got caught in the swamp, huh?\\
60 - That's why I always take a pitching wedge.\\
61 - Yeah, but then I birdied Three Little Pigs and Pirate's Cove.\\
62 - Fantastic.\\
63 - Of course, there was an unusually high pollen count when I got my top score, so who knows what it could have been?\\
64 - But that doesn't take anything away from this.\\
65 - It is quite an achievement, son.\\
66 - Hey, a hole-in-one on the 18th?\\
67 - You got a free game!\\
68 - Actually, the ball got stuck in the hole in the clown's mouth.\\
69 - -So the guy said I didn't qualify. -What?\\
70 - Everyone knows you ace the 18th hole, you win a free game! It's a sacred pact!\\
71 - You throw that out, next thing you know you're going to have a man marrying a horse down at City Hall.\\
72 - -Which guy was he? -I don't know.\\
73 - -Really tall, kind of heavy. -Oh, I know him.\\
74 - I was two tickets short of a giant comb and he wouldn't budge.\\
75 - Ended up with a troll keychain that went bald inside a week.\\
76 - So what'd you do about it?\\
77 - It's no big deal, Dad.\\
78 - You let people take advantage of you.\\
79 - But I got my best score ever.\\
80 - Son, I look at this card and all I see is shame.\\
81 - Here we go, honey.\\
82 - Now, I know it's against doctor's orders, but I did get us a little something sweet.\\
83 - Okay, Hal, but you be careful with your new bridgework.\\
84 - Oh, would you look at that?\\
85 - Little Robby was such a cute baby.\\
86 - Oh, that reminds me. Malcolm called while you were out. It seems Robby has burned down the neighbor's pool house.\\
87 - Malcolm says he's at his wit's end with that boy.\\
88 - Are you ready for this?\\
89 - I got an "F" on my math final.\\
90 - Oh, no, Reese, I thought you said you studied.\\
91 - Why do I even waste my time?!\\
92 - You know Mr. Escobar totally has it out for me 'cause I used to call his dad "Braceface."\\
93 - But you are going to pass this time, right, son?\\
94 - Do I look like a genie?!\\
95 - I can't predict the future!\\
96 - So why don't you just do me a favor and get off my back, okay, old man!\\
97 - -You can't treat your father like that! -Shove a cork in it, you crazy old hag!\\
98 - -My heart pills. -You'll get these when I get a sandwich.\\
99 - Off your wrinkled butt! Go, go, go!\\
100 - Reese, you may think you're pulling some kind of scam, but I'm on to you!\\
101 - You are getting a job starting tomorrow!\\
102 - And keep your dirty mitts off your father's toupee!\\
103 - I had the weirdest dream last night.\\
104 - This crazy witch with snakes for hair was screaming at me.\\
105 - It was like she was going to kill me, but for some reason it was really important to her that I get a job.\\
106 - Did she have bugged out crazy eyes?\\
107 - Yeah!\\
108 - She shows up in a lot of my dreams.\\
109 - Good morning, Reese.\\
110 - You going to get a job today?\\
111 - Okay, this is a little freaky.\\
112 - I don't see you looking in the want ads.\\
113 - You know, I had a job, Mom, and looking back on the whole experience, I've come to the conclusion that it's just not for me.\\
114 - -I'm done with the job thing. -I'm sorry, Reese...\\
115 - But not working isn't one of your options.\\
116 - Okay, I think I know what's going on here.\\
117 - Now, look, I want you to know that I'm not criticizing you and Dad.\\
118 - You obviously don't mind wasting your lives doing meaningless, repetitive tasks for unappreciative bosses.\\
119 - I respect that.\\
120 - Do you mind telling me what you intend to do?\\
121 - -I'd like to finish my cereal. -All right, Reese, that's it!\\
122 - I am tired of fighting you on this. Until you get a job, this free ride is over.\\
123 - Is anyone else getting a little tired of her?\\
124 - I'm sorry, Spiderman.\\
125 - Hey, where were you? You missed it.\\
126 - Randy Gerber shoved an entire Tater Tot up a ninth grader's nose.\\
127 - Oh, I forgot to tell you.\\
128 - Vicki and I are going to walk over and get lunch at the mall.\\
129 - Malcolm, what are you doing? We both agreed she's cheerleader scum.\\
130 - But that's before she made out with me for an hour behind the gym.\\
131 - Shut up!\\
132 - I know. I can't believe it either. And you know what else?\\
133 - She's sweet and kind and smart. Really smart.\\
134 - So the nasty, self-absorbed shallow thing is just an act?\\
135 - Wow, she's good.\\
136 - Somebody's a little late.\\
137 - Sorry. My friends are having a raging debate on glitter versus gloss.\\
138 - I couldn't just duck out of it.\\
139 - Didn't Fermat's last theorem settle that?\\
140 - He wishes.\\
141 - -Hey, guys. -Hey.\\
142 - What's with the geek?\\
143 - I thought chem lab wasn't till fifth period.\\
144 - Actually, Vicki and I are going to the mall to get lunch.\\
145 - You are so funny.\\
146 - Come on, son, keep up.\\
147 - And remember, just because a person is in a position of power, doesn't mean you can let them intimidate you.\\
148 - Can't we just stick a potato in his exhaust pipe like we did with your boss?\\
149 - There he is. Excuse me.\\
150 - -May I help you? -You better talk to this guy.\\
151 - He's pretty steamed.\\
152 - I got a hole-in-one on the 18th hole and I didn't get a free game.\\
153 - I remember you. Ball got stuck.\\
154 - I thought we went over this.\\
155 - We did.\\
156 - But for some reason, I just wanted to come over here and make sure.\\
157 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! My son is not done with you yet.\\
158 - Go on, tell him, Dewey.\\
159 - I have friends.\\
160 - Excuse me?\\
161 - I have friends.\\
162 - Friends who don't mind driving an extra 30 miles to the next miniature golf course, even if it does have a crow problem.\\
163 - -Are you threatening me? -Boy. Sure sounds like he is to me.\\
164 - Listen, kid, your ball didn't ring the bell.\\
165 - Ball doesn't ring a bell, no free game.\\
166 - And yet the boy feels like he got a hole-in-one.\\
167 - Listen, if you want to think you got a hole-in-one, I'll give you a scorecard.\\
168 - You can give yourself 18 holes-in-one.\\
169 - Excuse me.\\
170 - Dewey, no!\\
171 - Don't worry, I got him, but I am not always going to be here!\\
172 - Come on. Calm down.\\
173 - Malcolm, what happened? I thought we were meeting at the bookstore last night.\\
174 - You actually expect me to show up after the way you blew me off yesterday?\\
175 - Please don't be that way.\\
176 - What happened yesterday means nothing.\\
177 - What really matters is how special you are to me.\\
178 - Special?\\
179 - Yes. I really want to be with you, Malcolm. I just can't be seen with you in public.\\
180 - What? Are you serious?\\
181 - You have to appreciate my situation.\\
182 - I'm incredibly popular. I've been homecoming queen twice.\\
183 - And there's a certain image of me that people here are really invested in.\\
184 - How do you think this makes me feel?\\
185 - Look, nerdball, I have no idea where the Math Club meets. Did you lose your laminated map?\\
186 - All that matters is that you know how crazy I am about you.\\
187 - I think it's really romantic.\\
188 - It's like Romeo and Juliet.\\
189 - Our love has to be hidden.\\
190 - -I'm not hiding it. -I wish you would.\\
191 - So what you're saying is you can't be seen with me in the cafeteria or the quad or at dances.\\
192 - Or at games.\\
193 - I can only see you someplace where, God forbid, we won't run into any of your friends?\\
194 - Right!\\
195 - Okay.\\
196 - That breakfast looks pretty good.\\
197 - Yeah, it is.\\
198 - You want to do me a favor and go stink it up someplace else?\\
199 - How do you think I feel? I have to smell me all the time.\\
200 - Look, I've been having a tough week.\\
201 - Is there any chance you could lend me a couple bucks?\\
202 - Oh, sorry. I don't have my wallet on me.\\
203 - I'll catch you next time.\\
204 - God bless you.\\
205 - You know, Dewey, what Reese is doing is pointless and idiotic, but I think you can really learn something from him.\\
206 - This is what it looks like when someone stands up for themselves.\\
207 - I didn't get the free game, Dad.\\
208 - I accept that we don't always get what we want.\\
209 - Being part of this family has really prepared me for that.\\
210 - Listen, do me a favor, will ya?\\
211 - Talk to your brother.\\
212 - I'll see what I can do.\\
213 - Do you think you could help a guy a little down on his luck?\\
214 - Here.\\
215 - Don't tell your mother.\\
216 - Smells like a dead squirrel's in the wall again. Hal...\\
217 - Oh, my God, it's you. Reese, you smell like an open sewer.\\
218 - And whose fault is that?\\
219 - Yours. All you have to do to stop this nonsense is get a job.\\
220 - Excuse me, but I think I've made it pretty clear where I stand on that issue.\\
221 - Well, you can't stay here like this.\\
222 - Is that an apology?\\
223 - No, it's an invitation to live in the backyard.\\
224 - Listen to yourself! You don't even sound the least bit guilty.\\
225 - I've given you enough chances.\\
226 - Out!\\
227 - Okay, but if the cats start disappearing from the neighborhood, don't blame me!\\
228 - Things are going better than ever with Vicki.\\
229 - We went on a picnic, to the movies, and she even lets me ride in her car...\\
230 - as long as I keep my head down.\\
231 - Oh, by the way, I was able to get out of that student council meeting, so I'm free after school.\\
232 - Hey, great. I was thinking that...\\
233 - the hydroxide ions necessary for the neutralization must be supplied by a weak base such as ammonium hydroxide.\\
234 - What is with you, freak? Every time I turn around you're hounding Vicki about that stupid experiment.\\
235 - Is he bothering you?\\
236 - Yeah, kind of.\\
237 - Leave Vicki alone.\\
238 - Okay, butt-wipe?\\
239 - You know, I was kind of skeptical at first,\\
240 - but now I see what you two have is really beautiful.\\
241 - Oh, no, you don't!\\
242 - Reese!\\
243 - Okay, what now?\\
244 - What on earth do you think you're doing?\\
245 - We're testing out our new heating system.\\
246 - I think it's going to be a very comfortable winter.\\
247 - Hi. Lloyd Johnson. I'm an associate of your son's.\\
248 - Get out of here before I turn the hose on you.\\
249 - You can't treat Lloyd like that after what the CIA did to his brain waves.\\
250 - Reese, I want you to get this eyesore out of here right now.\\
251 - Eyesore? That is a sub-zero box. It's a hell of a lot nicer than anything we've ever thrown out.\\
252 - All right, you won't get rid of it, I will.\\
253 - I could've told you those boxes are reinforced.\\
254 - With some curtains and a couple of plants, it was going to look very nice.\\
255 - Oh, just shut up and help me get in the house!\\
256 - Look, Vicki...\\
257 - I know, I know, but...\\
258 - It's a school dance, so my being there shouldn't be an issue.\\
259 - No, no, I know.\\
260 - Of course it'll fool everybody.\\
261 - But I just think it's kind of weird that you got me a date.\\
262 - I don't even like Cindy that much and, you know, I want to be with...\\
263 - What'd you do that for?\\
264 - Consider this an intervention, Malcolm.\\
265 - I'm declaring you incompetent to run your own love life.\\
266 - What are you talking about?\\
267 - Vicki and I have this incredible relationship.\\
268 - There are worlds inside that I have yet to discover.\\
269 - And I know she feels the same way about me.\\
270 - Really? Is that why she threw a soda can at you?\\
271 - That was my fault. I wasn't supposed to be in the quad.\\
272 - Malcolm, you deserve better.\\
273 - I mean, there are lots of girls who'd be proud to actually be seen with you in public.\\
274 - Oh, really? Like Who?\\
275 - Like me.\\
276 - What?\\
277 - But...\\
278 - But all we do is fight all the time.\\
279 - Figure it out, genius.\\
280 - Here's some ice for your back, Mom.\\
281 - There.\\
282 - I also made you some soup 'cause I figured you might get hungry later.\\
283 - You know, really hungry.\\
284 - No, I'm okay now, Reese.\\
285 - Well, I'm going to go back outside and bang out the dents in my bedroom.\\
286 - Reese?\\
287 - You should move your box closer to the garage. You'll be out of the wind that way.\\
288 - Thanks.\\
289 - Wait a minute.\\
290 - I really appreciate you helping me out. If there's anything you need...\\
291 - I'm fine.\\
292 - I found a mattress in the alley and Lloyd's going to let me hang with him tomorrow at his freeway off-ramp.\\
293 - Well, I was going to say if you wanted my soup you could have...\\
294 - As long as you're not going to eat it, 'cause I can take it or leave it.\\
295 - Malcolm, where have you been?\\
296 - Cindy has just been sitting there bored out of her mind.\\
297 - Yeah.\\
298 - I'm not going to the dance.\\
299 - I'm just here to tell you I don't think we should see each other anymore.\\
300 - I thought things were going really great between us. Would you mind moving over behind that plant?\\
301 - No, I'm not hiding anymore, Vicki.\\
302 - You may not realize it, but there are girls who would be thrilled to be seen with me in public.\\
303 - Malcolm, please...\\
304 - I think that...\\
305 - Hey, Vicki, that Huzbat kid is dancing again. It's hilarious.\\
306 - What's going on?\\
307 - I'll be with you in a moment.\\
308 - Malcolm, I know this has been really difficult for you.\\
309 - It's just a lab experiment, okay?\\
310 - Just give it a little more time.\\
311 - Things will get better.\\
312 - I don't care if the cobalt crystals aren't dissolving, it's Friday night.\\
313 - Just give me another chance.\\
314 - Forget it, Vicki. It's over.\\
315 - Whatever!\\
316 - Can't I at least go back to bed?\\
317 - I'd say yes if I thought you could live with yourself, son.\\
318 - No.\\
319 - We are going to get you your free game.\\
320 - This is the moment of truth and we can stand tall knowing we have the moral high ground.\\
321 - Now lift the fence so I can crawl under.\\
322 - That's it, now line it up.\\
323 - And easy with the backswing.\\
324 - Dad, this is ridiculous.\\
325 - I can't see a thing.\\
326 - All right, Dewey, I am tired of your attitude.\\
327 - Now you are owed a fun time.\\
328 - And if you're not having fun, then we're just a couple of idiots playing miniature golf at midnight!\\
329 - Okay, you want to have fun?\\
330 - Let's have fun.\\
331 - Great.\\
332 - The ball is stuck in there now.\\
333 - Good.\\
334 - No, no, no, no. We are not quitting that easily.\\
335 - Look, son, I know you're angry but if you're really honest with yourself, you'll realize you're not mad at me.\\
336 - It sure feels like I am.\\
337 - No, you are mad at the jerk that runs this place.\\
338 - Bet he's at home right now sitting in his barcalounger with a big bowl of popcorn on his lap chuckling at us with the boobs that he...\\
339 - Hey. What was that?\\
340 - Hey, Dewey...\\
341 - The door's locked. What's going on?\\
342 - I told you I was happy without my free game, but you wouldn't listen.\\
343 - Dewey!\\
344 - I'm your father. Let me out!\\
345 - Just because someone's in a position of power, you can't let them intimidate you, right?\\
346 - Don't you walk away...\\
347 - Dewey!\\
348 - Hey!\\
349 - You're standing up to me. Good boy!\\
350 - Wait!\\
351 - That's all I wanted.\\
352 - Hey, what's this? Raccoons.\\
353 - Dewey! Don't you even care that your father is being eaten by raccoons?!\\
354 - Help!\\
355 - I did it!\\
356 - I told Vicki it was over.\\
357 - And it felt so good.\\
358 - Wow, that's great, Malcolm.\\
359 - To be honest, I didn't think you had the strength to do it.\\
360 - So that's it.\\
361 - Now we're free to be together.\\
362 - Yeah.\\
363 - You know, there's just one problem.\\
364 - I don't feel that way about you, Malcolm.\\
365 - What?\\
366 - -But what about what you said? -Yeah, I lied about that.\\
367 - I just couldn't stand to see someone make a fool of you.\\
368 - Someone besides me, that is.\\
369 - But...\\
370 - Great.\\
371 - I just blew off Vicki, and now I'm left standing here looking like a complete idiot.\\
372 - But you recognize it.\\
373 - See, you're getting better already.\\
374 - You're so sure of yourself, aren't you?\\
375 - Well, the truth is, I didn't need you. I could've figured this out on my own.\\
376 - Yeah, sometime after your secret marriage and three secret kids.\\
377 - Shut up.\\
378 - Look, Malcolm, I'm on your side.\\
379 - I mean, do you really think I just hang out with you out of pity?\\
380 - You're an amazing...\\
381 - complicated guy who's...\\
382 - always surprising me.\\
383 - I mean, who knows where things could go between us.\\
384 - Yeah, nothing.\\
385 - Good night, Malcolm.\\
386 - Okay, the heating pad's plugged in, here's your aspirin.\\
387 - And let me know if you need anything else.\\
388 - I'm really sorry about your back, Mom.\\
389 - Thank you, Reese.\\
390 - I'm still angry with you.\\
391 - But you've really come through for me.\\
392 - Your blankets and new sheets are in the trunk of my car. You can move back in if you want.\\
393 - Thanks, Mom.\\
394 - I'd like that.\\
395 - Reese!\\
396 - Reese!\\
397 - Get in here, do you hear me?!\\
398 - What's the matter with you?\\
399 - Are you deaf?\\
400 - It's time for my sponge bath.\\
401 - You think these stomach folds are going to scrape themselves out?\\
402 - I'm going to get a job. I'm going to have a life of my own away from here.\\
403 - And just in case I don't, you can clean out your own damn stomach folds!
\subsection {Episode 07: Blackout}
1 - Dr. Baxter's Corvette?\\
2 - Mrs. Smith's mini-van.\\
3 - I want to savor the moment.\\
4 - Malcolm in the Middle - 7.07 - "Blackout" Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script par Raceman. Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
5 - Have you seen Malcolm?\\
6 - No! And you haven't either.\\
7 - -I haven't. -Good.\\
8 - Then we understand each other.\\
9 - And you're going to make yourself scarce tonight.\\
10 - But I'm cooking.\\
11 - Mom and Dad are going out for their anniversary and they're letting me pick dinner.\\
12 - I'm not eating cereal for dinner!\\
13 - Yes, you are.\\
14 - Dad said if I emptied out the rat traps in the crawl space, then I get to pick dinner.\\
15 - That's funny.\\
16 - He didn't consult me, seeing as I have the fist and you have the face.\\
17 - Reese says I don't get to pick dinner.\\
18 - He's right, you don't.\\
19 - Change of plans. Your mother and I are celebrating our anniversary at home. We're having steaks.\\
20 - No fair!\\
21 - I wiped up rat brains!\\
22 - You promised!\\
23 - Dewey, if I kept half the promises I made, this family would plunge into chaos.\\
24 - You come with me now.\\
25 - I didn't do anything!\\
26 - What's going on?\\
27 - Kobe.\\
28 - What?\\
29 - I have Kobe beef.\\
30 - -No way. -Yes!\\
31 - That's like $60 an ounce.\\
32 - I know. I won it in a Minesweeper tournament at work.\\
33 - Years of practicing eight hours a day has finally paid off.\\
34 - I've never even seen Kobe beef.\\
35 - It's like meeting the Pope, but you get to eat him.\\
36 - Exactly. But this is treated much better than any pope was or ever will be.\\
37 - It lives on beer and ice cream.\\
38 - And right up until the moment of slaughter, its rump and thighs are massaged by geishas.\\
39 - It should be eating us.\\
40 - There's only two.\\
41 - One for me... one for the chef.\\
42 - You are the only person in this family qualified to cook up these babies.\\
43 - This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\\
44 - Mom doesn't get any on her anniversary?\\
45 - You didn't hear me.\\
46 - Once in a lifetime.\\
47 - I've had 22 anniversaries.\\
48 - I'm telling your mother I screwed up the reservations and we're having a steak dinner at home.\\
49 - You cook up these next to the prison-grade crap that I'm giving the rest of the family.\\
50 - Where's Malcolm?\\
51 - I have no idea where Malcolm is or what he's doing...\\
52 - Or why he's doing whatever it is that I don't know what he's doing.\\
53 - All right, I know you're hiding something, but I don't care.\\
54 - No, no, Jamie, I don't want anyone to know I'm here.\\
55 - Look...\\
56 - Here's a toy.\\
57 - See? Fun.\\
58 - Hello?\\
59 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
60 - <b>6:42 pm PARENTS' BEDROOM</b>\\
61 - -Hal! -I paid the bill.\\
62 - It's the whole neighborhood.\\
63 - See?\\
64 - God wants our evil plan to work.\\
65 - Go.\\
66 - Hal! I can't see anything!\\
67 - I'll find a flashlight.\\
68 - Oh, would you look at that.\\
69 - Is there a single neighbor that lends us something that doesn't have dead batteries?\\
70 - -What was that? -I'll check.\\
71 - Maybe an emboldened possum.\\
72 - Francis!\\
73 - Mom.\\
74 - What are you doing here?\\
75 - I... need a bandage.\\
76 - I tripped over something in the garage, when the lights went out.\\
77 - What were you doing in the garage?\\
78 - I was hiding from Dad. I wanted to talk to you first.\\
79 - Francis, your father and I have a joint checking account. It doesn't matter who you talk to first.\\
80 - No, it's just... you know how emotional he gets. I don't want him overreacting when he hears what happened.\\
81 - What happened?\\
82 - I think my marriage is over.\\
83 - -That's bad news. -Of course it is.\\
84 - What's going on?\\
85 - We've been fighting about everything lately.\\
86 - I mean, how do you answer when someone asks, "Does your face have to look like that?"\\
87 - I put up with her face.\\
88 - With that nose always pointing at me.\\
89 - Oh, Francis...\\
90 - I still love her; I don't want it to end, but I just... I don't see how it's going to last.\\
91 - Lois, can you come out here? I need you.\\
92 - Just don't tell Dad, okay?\\
93 - He'll be a mess and I'll end up having to take care of him.\\
94 - Okay, I'll get your father out of the way and then you and I can talk later.\\
95 - Francis, I'm so glad you're here.\\
96 - Dad promised we'd all have cereal for dinner tonight, and now he won't let us.\\
97 - Dewey, I understand.\\
98 - And I swear to you by all that is holy that you will be eating cereal tonight.\\
99 - You can count on me.\\
100 - You're not going to do anything, are you?\\
101 - No, I'm not.\\
102 - But I'll tell you what I will do.\\
103 - If you let anyone know I'm here, I will punch you so hard in the stomach,\\
104 - you won't be able to eat cereal for two days.\\
105 - There. Problem solved.\\
106 - The bedroom, where you, Hal, are headed right now.\\
107 - Where did that come from?\\
108 - I'm just trying to celebrate our anniversary.\\
109 - Not just yet.\\
110 - I still have some work to do.\\
111 - Officer, what is this about?\\
112 - You better lock the doors.\\
113 - Actually, Hal, you know, on second thought, I'm really not in the mood.\\
114 - Oh, I see.\\
115 - Stoke the flame.\\
116 - Oh, I like the way you think.\\
117 - Hello?\\
118 - Malcolm! For God sakes, we've been looking all over for you.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Wait, slow down. I can't understand what you're saying.\\
121 - Are you drunk?\\
122 - -You are drunk! -Who's drunk?\\
123 - Malcolm. He's drunk at a party 100 miles down the freeway.\\
124 - Now we both have to go down there, pick him up and drive his car back.\\
125 - Oh, for God's sake!\\
126 - You know what would teach him a lesson?\\
127 - If we made him wait until after we ate dinner.\\
128 - Let him stew in his own juices.\\
129 - His own delicious, savory juices.\\
130 - Get your keys, Hal. I'll meet you in the car.\\
131 - All right!\\
132 - Malcolm... you just stay right where you are.\\
133 - I hate children.\\
134 - So clever.\\
135 - It'll take them two hours on the highway, an hour to figure out I'm not there and then two hours back.\\
136 - So I'd say I have about five hours left to live.\\
137 - How about we make it worthwhile?\\
138 - -That stupid fish! -Malcolm!\\
139 - Crap!\\
140 - -Malcolm! -Crap!\\
141 - Hello?\\
142 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
143 - <b>6:42 pm THE BACKYARD</b>\\
144 - There it is. Sweet!\\
145 - This is going to solve all my problems.\\
146 - Piama. Hi, baby.\\
147 - I found it.\\
148 - It is even more beautiful than I remember.\\
149 - I'm going to grab it and go. They won't even know I was here. I love you.\\
150 - Jamie, go get the stick.\\
151 - Jamie...\\
152 - Oh, did the blackout scare you?\\
153 - Listen, pal, I need the batteries from one of your toys.\\
154 - Where's that frog that used to shock you in the bathtub?\\
155 - Hey, Lois, can you come out here? I need you.\\
156 - What's this? I thought we were going out for our anniversary.\\
157 - Honey, this is going to be even better.\\
158 - We are going to stay home and have Kobe beef.\\
159 - Okay, I thought you'd be a little excited.\\
160 - Ah, I'm sorry, Hal. I'm just a little lost in thought.\\
161 - A friend at work is having, um...\\
162 - marital problems.\\
163 - And that's very sad.\\
164 - But we are going to have Kobe beef.\\
165 - Reese is going to prepare its flesh perfectly because he thinks he's going to get some to eat.\\
166 - But he's not.\\
167 - Isn't that great?\\
168 - -That's a good scheme. -You bet it's a good scheme.\\
169 - -Do you know where my apron is? -I washed it, it's in the bedroom closet.\\
170 - The bedroom.\\
171 - Where you, Hal, are headed right now.\\
172 - Where did that come from?\\
173 - I'm just trying to celebrate our anniversary.\\
174 - Francis!\\
175 - Mom.\\
176 - I don't have a lot of time and I want to talk to you about your marriage.\\
177 - Oh, yeah, great.\\
178 - I'd love to hear what you have to say.\\
179 - Have you and Piama thought about, uh...\\
180 - spicing things up?\\
181 - What?\\
182 - Francis, if it isn't right in the bedroom, it isn't going to be right anywhere else.\\
183 - What?\\
184 - When I say "the bedroom," I mean sex.\\
185 - Yeah, I got it.\\
186 - Francis, marriage isn't mental.\\
187 - It isn't even really about feelings.\\
188 - When you get  right down to it, it's a sloppy, sweaty physical act.\\
189 - Now, your father may have flaws,he may not make a lot of money,\\
190 - but he has never been other than a rigorous and challenging lover.\\
191 - Mom...\\
192 - Can I be frank with you?\\
193 - No!\\
194 - Do you remember sometimes in the morning I'd forget to put juice in your lunchbox?\\
195 - I was lucky I could remember my own name.\\
196 - Because, when your father gets down to work, and is intimate with me, he is like a skilled general invading a country.\\
197 - He doesn't just launch an assault by sea, he uses paratroopers and columns of infantry.\\
198 - And even secret agents.\\
199 - Honey, good for you. Get it all out.\\
200 - We can talk more later.\\
201 - -I'm willing to propose a compromise. -Dewey, give it up.\\
202 - You'll never get anything you want.\\
203 - We have to get rid of Mom and Dad.\\
204 - -Don't worry about it. -I am worried about it.\\
205 - Those Dutch girls won't hold forever.\\
206 - Dutch girls! No!\\
207 - Stay, Dutch girls, stay!\\
208 - We didn't have fun.\\
209 - American parties are supposed to have deejays and African-Americans.\\
210 - I'll get you those.\\
211 - We are leaving.\\
212 - If we wanted to be bored, we could go to Luxembourg.\\
213 - You can't go.\\
214 - While you were in there, a rock star called and said he's going to come over.\\
215 - We don't blame you for our bitter disappointment.\\
216 - We don't know how to overcome your country's Puritan heritage.\\
217 - I can learn!\\
218 - Teach me!\\
219 - Good-bye.\\
220 - No, no, no, please, don't leave.\\
221 - I'll lose face.\\
222 - In American culture, if I say I'm throwing a party and my guests leave, then I'm humiliated.\\
223 - And I have to prove myself in combat against the mayor.\\
224 - I might die.\\
225 - We know your story's a load of crap, but we think you're cute. We'll stay.\\
226 - But if we are not drunk in 20 minutes, we are leaving.\\
227 - Thank you so much for being reasonable. Just go back in my room and stay out of sight.\\
228 - This won't take long, I promise.\\
229 - Dude, I can't believe you admitted you're afraid to fight the mayor.\\
230 - What are we going to do about Mom and Dad?\\
231 - I've got it covered.\\
232 - How?\\
233 - Let's just say that since people started getting prescription drugs in the mail, it's opened a whole new world of possibility.\\
234 - Remember when Dad took away my GameBoy and then he fell asleep at work and he thought he was going to be fired?\\
235 - Tuna salad with cumin and allergy medicine.\\
236 - Reese, do you know how crazy and dangerous that is?\\
237 - Even you wouldn't poison your own family.\\
238 - No? Malcolm, last month, when you thought your watch skipped from Wednesday to Friday...\\
239 - it wasn't the watch.\\
240 - Okay, I've got a plan that isn't insane.\\
241 - I'll make a call to get them out of the house.\\
242 - Oh, here comes Dad. Just keep him occupied.\\
243 - How are the coals looking?\\
244 - Almost ready.\\
245 - Oh, okay. Let me know.\\
246 - -Dad, wait. -What?\\
247 - Where do babies come from?\\
248 - Reese, I'm sure we've talked about this.\\
249 - Yeah, but I'm blanking.\\
250 - Two guys, right?\\
251 - You know, we can talk about this later.\\
252 - You better get that phone. It sounds like it's for you.\\
253 - I hate children.\\
254 - Francis? Francis?\\
255 - I had another thought for you and Piama ballroom dancing.\\
256 - Oh, that sounds great, Mom. But you know, your advice from earlier,\\
257 - it really helped out, so I think we're going to be cool.\\
258 - -That stupid fish?! -Malcolm!\\
259 - Crap!\\
260 - -That stupid fish?! -Malcolm!\\
261 - Crap!\\
262 - Hello?\\
263 - <b>6:42 pm </b>\\
264 - <b>6:42 pm THE KITCHEN</b>\\
265 - Come on. Follow me, this way.\\
266 - Movies are wrong.\\
267 - America is not a fun country.\\
268 - The public transportation is underfunded and you can't drink beer in the library, and now the lights are out.\\
269 - This country's also full of lying fathers who say you can have cereal and then make you eat steak.\\
270 - I promise you, you'll have fun.\\
271 - Dewey, shut up and get lost!\\
272 - If you understood our culture better, there's no way you'd be here.\\
273 - It's not going to work.\\
274 - Mom and Dad aren't going anywhere. We're going to have to do this another night.\\
275 - There is no other night. They're going home tomorrow.\\
276 - But there is a blackout.\\
277 - What are we supposed to do with a bunch of Dutch girls in the dark?\\
278 - These girls are from Amsterdam.\\
279 - They don't even have a word for virginity there.\\
280 - Is there a high-speed train available to take us to a "juke joint"?\\
281 - We wish to experience typical American culture.\\
282 - And you will.\\
283 - This is a very important part of American culture.\\
284 - Which is getting the parents out of the house.\\
285 - You know, teenage hijinks.\\
286 - In Holland, parents enjoy for children to have pleasure.\\
287 - I know, it's crazy. And yet, we rule the world.\\
288 - Okay, Malcolm, your arrogant American attitude has charmed us.\\
289 - -There will be alcohol? -I promise.\\
290 - You just go and wait in our room and we'll get it all sorted out.\\
291 - I get the easy-looking one on the left.\\
292 - We all speak English.\\
293 - I know.\\
294 - Come on, come on. Let's go.\\
295 - Just because it's drugs, doesn't mean it has to taste bad.\\
296 - I hate children.\\
297 - I can't believe it.\\
298 - Your mother and I, well, all of us, really are missing the greatest beef in the world because your brother Malcolm is drunk!\\
299 - He's not drunk, Dad.\\
300 - -He's hiding under his bed with Dutch girls. -Don't cover for him!\\
301 - Malcolm, you're such a big man when you're getting drunk to impress your friends.\\
302 - But when it's time to drive home and take your punishment, it's "Oh, Daddy, come save me."\\
303 - -That stupid fish! -Malcolm!\\
304 - Crap!\\
305 - You're here!\\
306 - Kinda.\\
307 - You lied to me. You're not drunk at all!\\
308 - You lied to me. You're not getting divorced.\\
309 - Sorry.\\
310 - You sold out your wife and your marriage and got me all...\\
311 - -Excited, Mom? -No. Upset.\\
312 - All so you could steal your father's fish!\\
313 - You can't steal what belongs to you. I reeled it in for five hours.\\
314 - He just swooped in at the last moment and gaffed it.\\
315 - You said if I ever called and said I was drunk I wouldn't get in trouble.\\
316 - That only applies if you're actually drunk!\\
317 - That was ten years ago! Why do you even care?\\
318 - -It was between me and some guys. -What guys?\\
319 - They come around the pool, every day at 3:00, talking smack like all I do is hang around at the pool all day and I never did anything with my life.\\
320 - So I told 'em about the fish.\\
321 - And they said they didn't believe me!\\
322 - Man, I can't wait to see the look on Jason Sullivan's face!\\
323 - 3:00? How old are these people?\\
324 - Good point.\\
325 - A 12-year-old should not be lecturing people about how they have or have not lived their lives!\\
326 - -You're trying to impress a 12-year-old? -Not trying to, going to.\\
327 - I don't want this dead fish in my house. You can have it.\\
328 - But once I help you, you know what you have to do.\\
329 - Learn not to care what other people think?\\
330 - Get a job!\\
331 - Yeah, that'll show 'em.\\
332 - I am going to decide your punishment on a full stomach, Malcolm.\\
333 - Malcolm?\\
334 - Francis?\\
335 - -You lied about being drunk? -What are you doing with my fish?\\
336 - Dinner!\\
337 - I don't know where you get it, the dishonesty. We are your family, and you betray us.\\
338 - God, this is so good, Reese.\\
339 - Thanks.\\
340 - Malcolm, I would like to reach into your ear and tear out that part of your brain that makes you do things like this!\\
341 - -Smoky. -That's the mesquite.\\
342 - I don't even know what's happening in my own house.\\
343 - Really good, Reese.\\
344 - Hey, thanks for your piece, Dewey. You sure you don't want any?\\
345 - No, thanks.\\
346 - That is so nice of you, Dewey.\\
347 - At least we have one boy we can trust.\\
348 - I taste?\\
349 - You don't want that.\\
350 - Reese made this special sleeping sauce for Mom and Dad,\\
351 - but I thought the whole family deserved some.\\
352 - A typical American dinner, no?\\
353 - A special American dinner.\\
354 - Lucky Charms?\\
355 - Danke.\\
356 - Mm, the frosted moons and stars are both magic and also delicious.\\
357 - I can't believe they promised it to you and then just tried to take it back.\\
358 - Forget about them.\\
359 - Let's just enjoy our time together.
\subsection {Episode 08: Army Buddy}
1 - God, Jamie.\\
2 - How in the world did you get a hold of one of these?\\
3 - Do you have any idea what could happen if you play around with one of these?\\
4 - Look. See?\\
5 - This isn't a game.\\
6 - This is not a toy.\\
7 - Call... your mother!\\

11 - Hi, hon. How was your day?\\
12 - It is Big Super Crazy Day at the Lucky Aide. I feel like I have been hit by a truck.\\
13 - Oh, here's your herbal tea.\\
14 - The thing is absolutely nothing is on sale.\\
15 - They take all the stuff off the shelves, dump it in the bins and the people go nuts.\\
16 - I dropped my car keys in one of 'em. I had to wrestle a woman for 20 minutes to get 'em back.\\
17 - Oh, God, my neck is killing me.\\
18 - Got it.\\
19 - Then this 90-year-old man with glaucoma comes in. He wants to pay for his toiletries with a bag full of pennies.\\
20 - Feet up.\\
21 - We finally settled on five dollars, six buttons and a run-over bottle cap.\\
22 - Feet down.\\
23 - I swear, Hal, I could hardly stand up through my shift.\\
24 - I'm afraid I'm going to have to break down and buy those custom orthotics for my shoes.\\
25 - Dr. Fletcher said I've got the pronation of a circus clown.\\
26 - Well, if you need 'em, you need 'em. That's all there is to it.\\
27 - That right heel looks like it could use some pumice.\\
28 - Hal, what would I do without you?\\
29 - I swear I couldn't make it through the day if you weren't here to pick up the pieces and put me back together again.\\
30 - Oh, nonsense, honey. I'm only doing what any husband would do.\\
31 - Any husband who cares.\\
32 - There.\\
33 - Back in.\\
34 - Now if you'll lean forward, I'll get that spot between your shoulder blades.\\
35 - Actually, that's the one part of me that doesn't hurt today.\\
36 - Really?\\
37 - Did I mention the washer is out again?\\
38 - I got it.\\
39 - It's not fair. You owe me ten dollars, Malcolm.\\
40 - You promised to pay me back a month ago.\\
41 - Dewey, it seems to me you're the only one holding onto this.\\
42 - The rest of us have moved on.\\
43 - You keep hounding people.\\
44 - Pretty soon, no one's going to want to borrow money from you.\\
45 - He fakes. He fakes again.\\
46 - A behind-the-back pass to...\\
47 - Do you get points for missing your mom's head?\\
48 - That rim's a little loose.\\
49 - Mom, how did you do that?\\
50 - Orthotics, boys.\\
51 - They can change your life.\\
52 - Give me a hand with the groceries, Malcolm.\\
53 - I might as well.\\
54 - I don't think I'll be playing basketball ever again.\\
55 - What the...?\\
56 - I've been waiting to get you alone, you miserable, scum-sucking piece of garbage.\\
57 - Short Stack, is that you?\\
58 - I don't believe it!\\
59 - What the hell are you doing here, you ugly grub eater?\\
60 - I had a few days' leave. Thought I'd spend it with my favorite idiot.\\
61 - Who's this?\\
62 - Only my best buddy from the army.\\
63 - Remember that story I told about that girl soldier who went all crybaby when she got her first care package from home?\\
64 - Abby's the one that kicked her ass and made her shut up.\\
65 - It was what any platoon leader would have done.\\
66 - I'm Abby Tucker. It's nice to meet you.\\
67 - I'm Lois. This is Malcolm.\\
68 - Oh, right, Pea Pod.\\
69 - I see what you mean.\\
70 - So, you're a platoon leader.\\
71 - It's nice the army let women have some authority once in a while.\\
72 - Yes, ma'am... although it does feel a little weird to give orders to men.\\
73 - Well, it shouldn't.\\
74 - Men are like dogs: it calms them down when they know their boundaries.\\
75 - Look, if you don't mind, she's only got a couple free days, and we've got a ton of catching up to do.\\
76 - Sure.\\
77 - I want my money.\\
78 - I want my money.\\
79 - I want my money.\\
80 - I want my money.\\
81 - I want my money.\\
82 - Dewey! I heard you the first 500 times.\\
83 - Just shut up.\\
84 - I want my money.\\
85 - I want my money.\\
86 - -I want my money. -You know.\\
87 - You're right.\\
88 - I wasn't being fair to you.\\
89 - A deal's a deal.\\
90 - I've been saving all this stuff for you for a special occasion.\\
91 - But today's as good a day as any.\\
92 - Happy Dewey day.\\
93 - You're giving me garbage.\\
94 - I once lent five bucks to Francis, and all I got was a double-dip swirly.\\
95 - Consider yourself lucky.\\
96 - Hi, honey, sorry I'm late.\\
97 - I had to stop by and pick up this puppy on my way home.\\
98 - Why don't you rub yourself up against this for a while, while I get your foot bath ready.\\
99 - I'm making a small adjustment on the pH, which I think you're going to find especially refreshing.\\
100 - Hal, you can forget about all that.\\
101 - I wore my new orthotics today.\\
102 - See?\\
103 - It was miraculous.\\
104 - All the pain and tension disappeared everywhere.\\
105 - It was like once my feet were properly supported, the rest of my body fell in line like a family of ducks.\\
106 - Well, how about that?\\
107 - So, I guess Crazy Days have quieted down a little, huh?\\
108 - Are you kidding? Today we started After Crazy Day Sale. It was wild.\\
109 - And wouldn't you know, the old blind guy with the pennies was back.\\
110 - He has the most delightful stories about his health.\\
111 - Did you know that men can get yeast infections?\\
112 - Imagine that.\\
113 - So, honey, you can put all that paraphernalia away. I don't need it anymore.\\
114 - Isn't that wonderful?\\
115 - Yeah. I couldn't be happier, hon.\\
116 - Shut up.\\
117 - Are you absolutely sure you don't want to sleep inside tonight?\\
118 - Ma'am, your backyard is more than adequate.\\
119 - Oh, and you folks don't have to worry about that possum any longer.\\
120 - Oh, well, thanks.\\
121 - I have to confess, I'm a great admirer of yours, ma'am.\\
122 - Me?\\
123 - Yes, ma'am.\\
124 - Reese told me so many amazing stories about you.\\
125 - Is it true you once made him cut the front lawn with a pair of manicure scissors?\\
126 - I can't take all the credit for that.\\
127 - After all, he was the one who didn't refill the ice cube tray.\\
128 - Malcolm, Reese, get the lead out!\\
129 - Say it, or I'll lick your ear!\\
130 - I'm a worthless sack of pus, and I will always be your bitch!\\
131 - You know it's true, but it's still nice to hear once in a while.\\
132 - So, is the latrine free?\\
133 - I think Dewey's still using it.\\
134 - That's okay. I dug my own.\\
135 - So when are you guys going to hook up and get it over with?\\
136 - What? What are you talking about?\\
137 - Oh, come on.\\
138 - Every time I turn around, she's got her hands all over you.\\
139 - She clearly digs you, dude.\\
140 - You take that back.\\
141 - What's your problem?\\
142 - I mean, I wouldn't turn my back on her, but I think she's kind of hot.\\
143 - No, she isn't.\\
144 - Buddies can't be hot.\\
145 - I don't believe you.\\
146 - The best friend I ever had wakes me up in the middle of the night,\\
147 - gives me a stinging face fart, and you go and turn it into something ugly!\\
148 - I sold those comics you gave me.\\
149 - Turns out they're pretty crappy.\\
150 - Dewey, we're done with this.\\
151 - In fact, Captain Danger 243 even had a misprint.\\
152 - Funny how people in the comic world are very interested in misprints.\\
153 - Especially when there's only five such copies in existence, and Quentin Tarantino has the other four.\\
154 - What are you talking about?\\
155 - Is it hot in here, or is just money?\\
156 - Oh, my God, this is fantastic!\\
157 - Who knew we were sitting on such a gold mine here?\\
158 - We? I don't think so.\\
159 - Dewey... you didn't think the whole garbage thing was for real, did you?\\
160 - You told me I should be happy with what you gave me, and I have to say...\\
161 - I am. Here's 20 bucks. Make yourself scarce.\\
162 - What? This is my room. You can't buy me out of here for 20 bucks.\\
163 - -Here's $40. -Forget it! I'm not...\\
164 - Okay.\\
165 - I'll be damned if I'm gonna call that washing machine repairman again.\\
166 - I could only find the Japanese version of the manual, but I think I get the gist of it.\\
167 - It's all taken care of, honey.\\
168 - What? What do you mean?\\
169 - After dinner, I felt so energized, I thought I'd take a look.\\
170 - Turns out one of Jamie's toys was jammed between the drum and the housing.\\
171 - Isn't that wonderful I don't have to bother you with all this anymore?\\
172 - Well, that's strange.\\
173 - What's that, dear?\\
174 - My orthotics they were right here in my shoes. I left them there last night.\\
175 - Where could they be?\\
176 - Beats me... unless...\\
177 - Wait a minute.\\
178 - Oh, for the love of...\\
179 - that darn kid!\\
180 - Who?\\
181 - Jamie. See, there's a little piece of jelly on the back of the shoe see that?\\
182 - We have to face it, Lois: we are raising a klepto.\\
183 - What would he want with my orthotics?\\
184 - Who knows?\\
185 - Yesterday, he took the last donut.\\
186 - Well... I doubt we'll ever see those orthotics again.\\
187 - Oh, and just when you were feeling so good.\\
188 - Oh! Why, God, why does this always happen to us?\\
189 - Why can't we just once catch a break?\\
190 - You did have them.\\
191 - Why are they covered in dirt? Did you bury them, you little devil?\\
192 - Isn't he a clever kid?\\
193 - Well, thanks again for the company, although I still don't know what you find so fascinating about my job at the Lucky Aide.\\
194 - Are you kidding?\\
195 - The way you handled that unruly mob without once firing over their heads.\\
196 - You are incredible.\\
197 - So you want to do some buddy stuff.\\
198 - You know, wrestle, horse around.\\
199 - No funny business, no strings attached.\\
200 - Yeah, sure.\\
201 - Just give me a second.\\
202 - What are you doing that for?\\
203 - My lips are a little bit chapped. You want some?\\
204 - What else did you buy?\\
205 - Shampoo and nail files, some Q-tips. Why?\\
206 - You don't have to get all fem on me!\\
207 - What's the matter, big dog?\\
208 - Afraid I can't take you anymore?\\
209 - What's wrong, Reese?\\
210 - We have to get some stuff out in the open.\\
211 - Punch me if I'm wrong, but there's something in the air around here that smells a whole lot more than friendship.\\
212 - God, am I that obvious?\\
213 - So it's true?\\
214 - Don't be mad, Reese.\\
215 - I swear I did not intend for this to happen.\\
216 - It's just a silly schoolgirl crush, and I know it won't go anywhere.\\
217 - I'm sorry.\\
218 - The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.\\
219 - Am I making you uncomfortable, Reese?\\
220 - No, it's cool.\\
221 - It's nothing I can't handle.\\
222 - That's good.\\
223 - I need someone to dry.\\
224 - Yes, ma'am.\\
225 - Damn! I never should have let her see me in my bike shorts.\\
226 - Hold it.\\
227 - You're not going anywhere.\\
228 - You don't even like this show.\\
229 - What's more important is, you don't either.\\
230 - Oh, good, a sing-a-long.\\
231 - Nice and loud now.\\
232 - Have I told you how much I love my orthotics?\\
233 - Yes. You made up a little song about them at dinner, remember?\\
234 - Are you coming to bed?\\
235 - Oh, I can't.\\
236 - I'm just too up to sleep.\\
237 - Well, if you're really looking to release some tension,\\
238 - I guess there's something I could do for you.\\
239 - If you ask nicely.\\
240 - Hal, you are sweet, but I'm going to take a rain check.\\
241 - I'm jogging on down to the high school to run a few laps.\\
242 - Hold these while I get my running shoes.\\
243 - Okay, you're done.\\
244 - The school day's officially over.\\
245 - This was worth way more than $45.\\
246 - You know, I have to agree.\\
247 - So tomorrow we'll go with Mom's earrings and something that shows off your figure.\\
248 - No, I'm done with this.\\
249 - I'm not going to humiliate myself anymore for money that's rightfully mine.\\
250 - Then you'll never know how much you could have had.\\
251 - Trust me, I really don't care.\\
252 - Not at all?\\
253 - No.\\
254 - Not even to the nearest thousand?\\
255 - Thousand?\\
256 - Nah, you're right. This is getting kind of boring.\\
257 - I'm sure I can find some other way to torment you.\\
258 - No! No!\\
259 - This is working out great.\\
260 - Look, I'm even breaking out in hives.\\
261 - You don't want to throw that away.\\
262 - I got it. How about I go walking through the mall tomorrow...\\
263 - wearing swim fins and goggles.\\
264 - We'll see.\\
265 - How long have you been here?\\
266 - Since last night.\\
267 - To be honest, I'm a little hurt that no one seemed to miss me.\\
268 - Is this about Abby?\\
269 - You were right, Malcolm.\\
270 - She wants me bad.\\
271 - This is a disaster.\\
272 - Why?\\
273 - You've got a girl that's crazy about you.\\
274 - But it's just wrong.\\
275 - She's my buddy.\\
276 - The best friend I've ever had.\\
277 - But in a roll around the floor and make her smell my armpit kind of way.\\
278 - Everyone has their own kind of foreplay.\\
279 - The important thing now is how you feel about her.\\
280 - It's hard to say.\\
281 - Now when I think about her, I get all nervous in my stomach.\\
282 - Like my bowels could cut loose at any moment.\\
283 - That's love, dude.\\
284 - You'd think somebody would put that in a song.\\
285 - Listen, I know we've had our differences, but I say this as a brother.\\
286 - You're not that great a catch.\\
287 - This girl might be the best shot you'll ever get.\\
288 - You need to suck it up and at least tell her how you feel.\\
289 - Otherwise, you might end up looking like an idiot.\\
290 - Do we still have the skirt that goes with these?\\
291 - Who's the lamebrain who left the trash cans in the middle of the driveway?!\\
292 - Yes!\\
293 - I hate these things.\\
294 - Oh, honey, what happened?\\
295 - I was standing at my cash register putting up these cute little butterfly decals,\\
296 - when suddenly, I got the most excruciating cramp in my leg.\\
297 - It was like that time Francis chomped down on me, only I couldn't turn the hose on it.\\
298 - You know, if they're going to fix one problem and just cause another, I don't want any part of them.\\
299 - Why don't I get the footbath ready?\\
300 - It's my own damn fault for thinking there was a magic pill to give me my life back.\\
301 - I should have known it was too good to be true.\\
302 - You can't trust the banks.\\
303 - You can't trust your own kids.\\
304 - And you obviously cannot trust doctors.\\
305 - God, Hal, you're the only person I still have to believe in. I'm so happy I can still trust you.\\
306 - Oh. Sorry. I was... looking for Reese.\\
307 - Well, if the refrigerator door isn't open, he's probably not home.\\
308 - Hal, get rid of these.\\
309 - I'm gonna try to walk it off.\\
310 - Well, honey, you know, it may not be all their fault.\\
311 - I've made up my mind.\\
312 - I do not want them anymore.\\
313 - Looks like a mild strain of the gastrocnemius.\\
314 - Used to see it all the time in boot camp.\\
315 - Uh, you might want to try massaging that muscle.\\
316 - You think so?\\
317 - Well, I'd be happy to do it for you.\\
318 - Oh, would you?\\
319 - Abby, that would be great.\\
320 - Go ahead.\\
321 - Don't be timid.\\
322 - No, really... dig in.\\
323 - Oh, yeah!\\
324 - Oh, God, that's the spot.\\
325 - Oh, yes.\\
326 - Yes.\\
327 - Don't stop.\\
328 - That's it.\\
329 - That's a little high.\\
330 - I'm sorry.\\
331 - Did you just make a pass at me?\\
332 - Ma'am, forgive me.\\
333 - Oh, no, no, no, it's not that I'm not flattered, but I'm the mother of, like, five children. I've been married for 100 years.\\
334 - -Why would you think...? -I was wrong, ma'am.\\
335 - I was way out of line.\\
336 - Do I give off that kind of vibe?\\
337 - Because I would hate to think people are walking around with me giving them false hopes.\\
338 - Would it help if I changed my hair?\\
339 - -Ma'am, I really have to go. -Sure.\\
340 - Don't beat yourself up.\\
341 - I'm sure there are many women who find you very attractive.\\
342 - Don't forget the cherry.\\
343 - There. Happy?\\
344 - In truth, it was better conceptually.\\
345 - Just give me my money and leave me alone.\\
346 - Tough words for a human sundae.\\
347 - What do you know?\\
348 - That's the last of it.\\
349 - Really? That's the last of it?\\
350 - So it appears.\\
351 - Aha! Who looks like the idiot now, huh?\\
352 - I've got all the money all $148 of it, and what do you have, little man?\\
353 - Nothing!\\
354 - Except my self-respect, but it's hard to put a price on that.\\
355 - Wait, maybe I can.\\
356 - <b>I have a surprise for you in the garage. - Reese.</b>\\
357 - Reese?\\
358 - You in here?\\
359 - I have a present for you.\\
360 - What?\\
361 - Something I've never given another girl in my entire life.\\
362 - I hope you like it.\\
363 - Reese, what the...?\\
364 - Oh my God, you tied a bow.\\
365 - I'm giving you my innocence.\\
366 - I've saved myself for you, Abby.\\
367 - -Let's not wait any longer. -I'm gay.\\
368 - What?!\\
369 - I like women.\\
370 - Are you kidding?\\
371 - No. I thought you knew.\\
372 - You dropped your bow.\\
373 - So, you don't think I'm attractive, not even a little?\\
374 - Look, uh, maybe if you were the last person on earth,\\
375 - or we were trapped on a desert island, and you had surgery...\\
376 - Nope. You're still dog meat.\\
377 - This is fantastic!\\
378 - We're buddies again!\\
379 - We're right back where we started!\\
380 - Wait a minute.\\
381 - But If I'm not the girl you're hung up on around here...\\
382 - Oh, my God.\\
383 - Oh, my God!\\
384 - -Reese, it was just a stupid... -Big Gloria, the meter reader?\\
385 - Yes.\\
386 - Yes. There was an awkward scene.\\
387 - It turns out she's taken, but that's not why I'm leaving.\\
388 - May not be seeing you for a while, Big Dog.\\
389 - So, this really is it then?\\
390 - You take care of yourself, Reese.\\
391 - You're a great guy, you know that?\\
392 - You're more than that.\\
393 - You're the best friend I've ever had.\\
394 - I'll miss you, too, buddy.\\
395 - A little more, and you will be just like new.\\
396 - All I got to say is that you better be good to her.\\
397 - Oh! Sweet mother of God!\\
398 - You home wrecker!\\
399 - Hal, what are you doing?\\
400 - Saving our marriage!\\
401 - What?!\\
402 - I was... I was...\\
403 - I was trying to put your orthotics back together the way they were, but I...\\
404 - There's only so much I can take, Lois.\\
405 - At some point, a man has to take a stand.\\
406 - What do you mean, put them back the way they were?\\
407 - Did you do something to my orthotics?\\
408 - Yes, and I'd do it again.\\
409 - -Why?! -Because...\\
410 - Because I miss the old you.\\
411 - I missed the Lois who would come home racked with pain and tension and snarling like a rabid bobcat.\\
412 - That Lois needed me to make her feel better.\\
413 - Oh, Hal.\\
414 - So, now you know.\\
415 - Now you can go out and get new...\\
416 - orthotics, and I'll just try to stay out of your way.\\
417 - Hal, you are being ridiculous.\\
418 - These things are not gonna replace you.\\
419 - Remember that time I got that nonstick German waffle iron?\\
420 - I was walking on air for weeks, but it didn't last.\\
421 - True.\\
422 - Remember when our kids made us happy?\\
423 - Oh, well, we were both just being stupid there.\\
424 - But the point is, something's always gonna come up.\\
425 - I'll be miserable again.\\
426 - You promise?\\
427 - Of course.\\
428 - Come on.\\
429 - Now, I am gonna get another pair, Hal.\\
430 - Fine, but I don't want to know about 'em.\\
431 - And keep them out of our bedroom.
\subsection {Episode 09: Malcolm Defends Reese}
1 - Reese, are you trying to sneak out?\\
2 - No. I'm trying to get comfortable in this crappy bed, if you don't mind.\\
3 - Fine. Then you won't mind if I stand right out here in the hall until I see you go to sleep.\\
4 - She can't stay awake all night.\\

8 - Fascinating timeline, Reese.\\
9 - So let's see.\\
10 - It was the moon landing, the War of 1812, then the Lincoln-Kennedy shoot-out.\\
11 - It's embarrassing enough having Reese in my class this year.\\
12 - What's worse is Herkabe's made him his personal whipping boy.\\
13 - Reese, I'm just looking through my notes here, and it appears that that was your 20th wrong answer in a row.\\
14 - And you know what that means, don't you?\\
15 - Monkey dance!\\
16 - Monkey dance! Monkey dance!\\
17 - Monkey dance?\\
18 - Your first right answer.\\
19 - Well, let's not leave your audience waiting.\\
20 - Wait, Reese.\\
21 - Stop.\\
22 - This isn't right.\\
23 - Okay, continue.\\
24 - Lois, hello, it's me, Claire.\\
25 - Hey, come on in.\\
26 - Hi, sweetie.\\
27 - Claire, you are a godsend.\\
28 - Thank you for taking him on such short notice.\\
29 - Is this schedule gonna work for you?\\
30 - Oh, good Lord, Lois. Any schedule works for me.\\
31 - What have I got to do with my time?\\
32 - Poke around a big, empty house, waiting for one of my kids to call?\\
33 - We both know that's not gonna happen.\\
34 - You know, you raise them, you put the through college,\\
35 - and loan them money to buy a house, and suddenly, they don't need you anymore.\\
36 - God forbid you should express a need to them.\\
37 - I could tell you stories...\\
38 - Bet you could.\\
39 - -Yeah. -Well.\\
40 - -Again, thank you. -I'm glad to do it, honestly.\\
41 - Takes my mind off my shingles.\\
42 - Good Lord, you've never felt pain like that in all your waking days.\\
43 - It's just dreadful.\\
44 - Did I tell you about the pain?\\
45 - -I think you did this morning. -It's worse than my arthritis, which is crippling.\\
46 - It feels like someone's stabbing you all over with tiny, razor-sharp knives.\\
47 - Oh, pray God you never get it, Lois.\\
48 - Oh, listen to me just going on and on about myself.\\
49 - Wind me up and I can talk all day.\\
50 - Well, like I said, I have a million things to do.\\
51 - You know, so do I, so do I.\\
52 - I have laundry stacked up just waiting for me.\\
53 - And I have so neglected my scrapbooking that it's a scandal. Do you scrapbook, Lois?\\
54 - They've got these really cute kits. It's a lot of fun.\\
55 - My niece Terri well, she prefers Teresa, but she's a Terri.\\
56 - Anyway, she got me started on it.\\
57 - Well, what else is she gonna do with herself? She's barren, poor thing.\\
58 - You're still mad at me?\\
59 - You threw at my head, Dad.\\
60 - It was a brushback pitch, Dewey.\\
61 - I got to protect the plate or you're gonna be taking me downtown all day.\\
62 - Hi.\\
63 - Hi.\\
64 - Did you do your vocab?\\
65 - Yeah. It wasn't so bad.\\
66 - Yeah, it was pretty easy.\\
67 - Yeah.\\
68 - So I'll see you in school?\\
69 - Talk to you later.\\
70 - What was that about?\\
71 - That's Gina.\\
72 - She's from my class.\\
73 - Do you like her?\\
74 - I don't know.\\
75 - I guess so.\\
76 - Well, you played it cool, son.\\
77 - Maybe too cool.\\
78 - Feel this shoulder, Lois.\\
79 - It's like a sack of burning jelly in there.\\
80 - Go ahead, give it a squeeze.\\
81 - It is spongier than the thing on your back.\\
82 - Hal, your home.\\
83 - Hi, honey.\\
84 - Hi, Hal.\\
85 - Hello.\\
86 - This is Claire, Jamie's new babysitter.\\
87 - I just moved into the Franklin's old house.\\
88 - -Hey, that's a nice place. -It is, it is on the outside.\\
89 - Of course it's full of dry rot. I must have called the guy 50 times...\\
90 - Claire was just leaving.\\
91 - Well, heck, why don't you stay and have dinner with us?\\
92 - No, no.\\
93 - Got to run.\\
94 - I hope it wasn't too much trouble cooking for my special diet, Lois.\\
95 - It's been a bit of an adjustment after the doctors took out six feet of my colon.\\
96 - You know what I call it now?\\
97 - My semicolon.\\
98 - My semicolon!\\
99 - Claire, I really have to go to sleep now.\\
100 - Oh, God, I wish I could sleep.\\
101 - I toss and turn all night. I start off on my stomach, then I flip over to my back.\\
102 - No, wait, no.\\
103 - I start on my back, I flip over to my stomach...\\
104 - I don't know.\\
105 - I can't think any more.\\
106 - Is it...\\
107 - "C"?\\
108 - I'm sorry, Reese. That's incorrect.\\
109 - Hammy?\\
110 - Yes!\\
111 - Fort Ticonderoga is correct.\\
112 - I was looking for a close race, but, Hammy, you've really run away with this thing.\\
113 - I'm sorry, that's all the time we have today, but join us again tomorrow for another exciting installment of... "What Is Dumber Than Reese?"\\
114 - You're nothing but a bully and a sadist, you know that?!\\
115 - How could you possibly take any satisfaction in humiliating Reese?!\\
116 - It's Reese!\\
117 - You have to stop this, now!\\
118 - Well, well, well, that took you long enough.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - I've been trying to get your attention since the semester began.\\
121 - I'm surprised you didn't say something last week, when Reese was curled up in a fetal ball under my desk.\\
122 - What do you want from me?\\
123 - Come with me.\\
124 - I won it my senior year.\\
125 - -Football trophy? -Behind that.\\
126 - -The soccer trophy? -Behind that.\\
127 - -There's just a bunch of crappy ribbons. -Behind the spelling bee award.\\
128 - That thing that looks like it broke off that other trophy?\\
129 - I cannot be responsible for the myopic value this sports-obsessed administration places on academic achievement.\\
130 - But that little plaque represents the highest GPA in the history of the school, and it is mine, Malcolm, all mine.\\
131 - So what?\\
132 - So wha...\\
133 - I had to work hard for that plaque.\\
134 - I had to score higher than Edna Fornby, who'd held the title for 38 years.\\
135 - A towering intellect, blind since birth, went on to be a Rhodes scholar.\\
136 - Really classy lady.\\
137 - Cried like a baby when I took it from her.\\
138 - What a night.\\
139 - And now, you are on track to take it from me.\\
140 - What's your point?\\
141 - I can't let that happen.\\
142 - And if you don't want to see me destroy your brother every day for the rest of the year...\\
143 - you won't let it happen.\\
144 - -Are you serious? -As a heart attack.\\
145 - Now, I can't just give you a "B."\\
146 - People are watching.\\
147 - For some reason, I rub people the wrong way.\\
148 - But that doesn't stop you from tanking the course on your own.\\
149 - Are you really that shallow and petty?\\
150 - You have no idea.\\
151 - So, you know, take a few days, think it over.\\
152 - It'll give me more time to think up some challenges for Reese.\\
153 - Do you think hot coals would set off the sprinkler system?\\
154 - Lois, I was just gonna bring Jamie home.\\
155 - Thought I'd save you the trip.\\
156 - Come on, Jamie.\\
157 - Thanks, Claire. See you tomorrow.\\
158 - Won't you come in?\\
159 - I'd love to, but I have such a busy schedule.\\
160 - I understand.\\
161 - Busy, busy, busy.\\
162 - No one has any time anymore.\\
163 - Oh, my goodness, I walked you all the way home.\\
164 - You get out of those work clothes, and I'll make some tea.\\
165 - Hey, Dewey, look at this.\\
166 - I got the microwave to work without closing the door.\\
167 - That's great, Dad.\\
168 - So, did you, uh... talk to Gina?\\
169 - No.\\
170 - Oh.\\
171 - It's just that you said you would talk to her later, and,\\
172 - I mean, if I remember, she remembers.\\
173 - Maybe I'll talk to her tomorrow.\\
174 - Tomorrow?\\
175 - Gee, Dewey, if I'm Gina, I don't know what's going on.\\
176 - It's no big deal, Dad.\\
177 - Dewey!\\
178 - Come here.\\
179 - Look... I know it's not easy figuring this stuff out.\\
180 - You want to be with her, but you just don't know what to say, and you feel like such a doofus.\\
181 - I know.\\
182 - So here's what you're gonna do.\\
183 - You're gonna go in the house right now and call her.\\
184 - Right now?\\
185 - Or you could wait till you're old, toothless, alone, living in a welfare hotel,\\
186 - hoping the couple screaming next door invites you over to dinner sometime.\\
187 - It's up to you.\\
188 - It's called leaky gut.\\
189 - Hal.\\
190 - Why don't we go out to dinner?\\
191 - Doesn't that sound good?\\
192 - Well, I'm helping Dewey with a project, hon.\\
193 - Why don't you go with Claire?\\
194 - When it's quiet, you can hear it dripping.\\
195 - Hear that?\\
196 - You ready?\\
197 - No, wait.\\
198 - I need more time.\\
199 - Believe me, I have been through it.\\
200 - You just want to run away, hide under the covers and cry.\\
201 - But you know what?\\
202 - That's how you know you're a man.\\
203 - Hello?\\
204 - Hello?\\
205 - Hello.\\
206 - Gina. Hi, this is Dewey's dad.\\
207 - He just called to say that he was thinking of you.\\
208 - Oh, and he thinks that homework is dumb.\\
209 - Really?\\
210 - She thinks homework is dumb, too.\\
211 - Reese.\\
212 - I think it's terrible what Herkabe's been putting you through in class.\\
213 - I really feel bad about the way he's treating you.\\
214 - I'll bet I could make you feel worse!\\
215 - Thought it over.\\
216 - What happened to your lip?\\
217 - Reese.\\
218 - He's a troubled young man.\\
219 - God knows I've tried my best with him, but you can't let that fact poison...\\
220 - Relax, I'm gonna do it.\\
221 - You will?\\
222 - Reese can't help who he is. And you can't help being a jerk.\\
223 - I'm the only one who has a choice over what I do.\\
224 - So, yeah, I'll take your sick little deal so you can keep your pathetic, meaningless plaque.\\
225 - Thank you, Malcolm.\\
226 - I know that you think that this compromised victory will taste like ashes in my mouth,\\
227 - but there's something I learned a long time ago.\\
228 - Ashes don't taste that bad.\\
229 - Okay, class, we'll start this morning with an oral quiz.\\
230 - Who was the victor in the disputed presidential election of 1896.\\
231 - Um...\\
232 - Malcolm?\\
233 - Surely you know this.\\
234 - Tilden.\\
235 - What was that?\\
236 - Tilden!\\
237 - That's incorrect.\\
238 - What an idiot!\\
239 - Monkey dance! Monkey dance!\\
240 - Monkey dance!\\
241 - Monkey dance!\\
242 - Monkey dance! Monkey dance!\\
243 - We have a problem.\\
244 - What?\\
245 - Some wavy-haired blond boy was chatting up Gina at the bike racks after school.\\
246 - Don't you work, Dad?\\
247 - Never mind that. The point is, you should have been there.\\
248 - It was probably Stephan.\\
249 - He's no threat.\\
250 - I saw him, Dewey.\\
251 - He's an Adonis!\\
252 - Okay, what you need here is some sort of romantic gesture.\\
253 - What do you mean?\\
254 - Just off the top of my head, you could send her a nice box of expensive chocolates.\\
255 - I'm not sure.\\
256 - Too late. You already did.\\
257 - You just dropped off a big box on her front doorstep, rang the bell and ran like hell.\\
258 - You also trampled some of her rose bushes.\\
259 - Congratulations, son.\\
260 - You're in the game.\\
261 - Hal, I have to do something about Claire. She is driving me crazy.\\
262 - Oh, Hal, that is so sweet.\\
263 - It's not for you.\\
264 - Didn't you learn your lesson with Francis?\\
265 - That Jenny Thompson was a stuck-up snot.\\
266 - Hal, I have bigger problems.\\
267 - I cannot stand that woman.\\
268 - Which normally isn't an issue, except, I can't afford to tell her off and lose her.\\
269 - She's good with Jamie, she's right down the street, she's incredibly cheap.\\
270 - She'd be perfect if she weren't the most annoying person on the face of the planet.\\
271 - I feel like the top of my head is going to explode if I hear her say another word.\\
272 - What rhymes with dreamy?\\
273 - Hal, for God's sake.\\
274 - I heard what you said, Lois.\\
275 - Look, you just have to completely disengage with her.\\
276 - Take Jamie when she drops him off, nod pleasantly, you can even smile, and then, slam the door in her face.\\
277 - And don't beat yourself up over it.\\
278 - Some people are just crazy.\\
279 - Do we have any fun stickers?\\
280 - B-minus! Ha!\\
281 - I did better than you.\\
282 - For the first time...\\
283 - Wait.\\
284 - A, B, C, D...\\
285 - Never mind.\\
286 - Buck up, Malcolm. Only 12 more weeks, and then I'll back off and let you pick the course you want to tank.\\
287 - Hey, we're not in your stupid class anymore, all right?\\
288 - Will you just leave me alone?\\
289 - Oh, a sullen rebuke. What a bonus.\\
290 - You know, I might make them get me a bigger plaque when I beat you, Malcolm.\\
291 - Ugh! How can they let it get so dingy?\\
292 - Hey, Slick!\\
293 - Instead of pushing dust around over there, why don't you polish up these trophies? It's disgraceful.\\
294 - You know, I'll admit, it wasn't easy beating old Fornby.\\
295 - Of course she had the added advantage of being blind and club-footed, no distractions,\\
296 - but still, I had to bust my hump that last semester.\\
297 - Did you know, instead of seventh period gym, I created my own AP class?\\
298 - While those Cro-Magnons were chasing balls and sweating like swine,\\
299 - I was sitting in an air-conditioned room with my tie unloosed, discussing Renaissance poetry.\\
300 - You wore a suit to school?\\
301 - And a silk handkerchief.\\
302 - They hated me because I made them look ridiculous.\\
303 - Okay, Dewey, you set the table with the box of candy.\\
304 - Now it's time to reap your reward.\\
305 - She's not going to feel like I'm trying to buy her, is she?\\
306 - Let me teach you a valuable lesson about women, Dewey.\\
307 - They think they deserve everything you give them.\\
308 - They all like to think they're special...\\
309 - even the ones that aren't.\\
310 - Now go.\\
311 - You can do it, Son!\\
312 - Yes?\\
313 - Is Gina home?\\
314 - Are you the kid that sent her that candy?\\
315 - Um... maybe.\\
316 - Don't you know she's allergic to nuts?\\
317 - Oh, God.\\
318 - Hello, Lois.\\
319 - Hi, sweetie.\\
320 - I made you a snack in the kitchen.\\
321 - What a day.\\
322 - Jamie was fine, but I got that horrible ringing in my ear. It was just dreadful. Do you ever get that?\\
323 - Well, you're blessed if you don't.\\
324 - I never noticed those cushions before. They're darling.\\
325 - What did you pay for them? They look so comfortable. Mind if I try 'em out?\\
326 - I'd like you to go now, Claire.\\
327 - Oh, good, because I have a ton of things to do.\\
328 - You know how it is, though, something always comes up.\\
329 - What I would like is for you to be in your own house now.\\
330 - Boy, so would I.\\
331 - I really have to clean my bathroom tile grout. It's disgusting.\\
332 - Get your fat butt out of my house!\\
333 - You're so funny. Although, I could lose a little weight here...\\
334 - Get out!\\
335 - Get out! Get out!\\
336 - Get out! Get out!\\
337 - Get out!\\
338 - Wow. Where did that come from?\\
339 - I have put up with this this long because I needed you for Jamie, but I've had it, lady.\\
340 - I'll send you a check for the money I owe you, and after that, I never want to see your face again.\\
341 - Well, now, I...\\
342 - Okay, I'm glad we finally got all that out in the open, 'cause now that we know we have issues, we can talk about them.\\
343 - You can't do this. Just because I missed one stupid gym class!\\
344 - It is a dark day for North High,\\
345 - but given recent information that has come to our attention regarding the previous GPA record holder and his failure\\
346 - to meet the physical education requirement, I have no choice.\\
347 - I take no pleasure...\\
348 - in the pain this unfortunate incident has caused, but rules are rules.\\
349 - So, I am directing that this plaque be returned to Edna Fornby,\\
350 - who though blind and crippled, managed to pass gym.\\
351 - Tough break, Mr. Herkabe.\\
352 - I know it was you, Malcolm.\\
353 - And I wouldn't be so quick to gloat. I'm not defeated yet.\\
354 - I'm like Napoleon at St. Helena, plotting my return.\\
355 - You mean Elba.\\
356 - He died on St. Helena.\\
357 - Oh, shut up!\\
358 - I have to call Mother before she hears it from someone else.\\
359 - Hey, honey.\\
360 - Hal, it's terrible.\\
361 - Oh, what happened?\\
362 - Claire died.\\
363 - What?\\
364 - Her sister just called.\\
365 - I guess no one really saw it coming.\\
366 - I feel so bad.\\
367 - Are you baking cookies?\\
368 - Snickerdoodles.\\
369 - Boy, life is so precarious, isn't it?\\
370 - You know, just yesterday, she was sitting right here, and then...\\
371 - Hal, you know what I just thought of?\\
372 - We never go dancing. Why don't we go dancing tonight?\\
373 - Doesn't that sound like fun?\\
374 - Yeah, sure.\\
375 - I guess.\\
376 - Excuse me, honey.\\
377 - You okay?\\
378 - Oh...\\
379 - You know, I've been thinking.\\
380 - Maybe she's not the right girl for you.\\
381 - She sure has made this hard on us.\\
382 - There's no "us," Dad.\\
383 - It's you.\\
384 - Every idea you have about girls is wrong.\\
385 - How was I ever born?\\
386 - Well, by that time, your mother was pretty much stuck in the relationship, and...\\
387 - Thanks a lot, Dad.\\
388 - I liked Gina.\\
389 - I really did.\\
390 - I'm sorry, Dewey. I feel terrible.\\
391 - Maybe there's some way I can help you...\\
392 - -No! -Okay, right.\\
393 - I will stay out of it.\\
394 - I can make this right.\\
395 - I have better candy.\\
396 - You'll like this candy.\\
397 - It's really good.\\
398 - Come on, just hop in the car.\\
399 - Come on, give me a break.\\
400 - Don't you remember your first love?\\
401 - What are you doing here?\\
402 - Reclaiming what is rightfully mine. Once I complete this course, they'll be forced to reinstate me.\\
403 - You can't take a class 20 years later.\\
404 - Who is being petty, now, Malcolm?\\
405 - No, no, no. You will soon discover what my cable guy learned the hard way you can't defeat Lionel Herkabe.\\
406 - You see, Malcolm...\\
407 - Hey, Mr. Herkabe.\\
408 - How do you like dodge ball?\\
409 - Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!\\
410 - You are just making yourself look weak and foolish!\\
411 - I might stop hitting you if you dance like a monkey.\\
412 - Like...\\
413 - like this?\\
414 - You call that a monkey dance?\\
415 - Some things you don't do for trophies.\\
416 - You treasure them here where it counts the most.\\
417 - You think that hurt?\\
418 - That didn't hurt.\\
419 - Oh, God, make it stop!\\
420 - No one can take that away.\\
421 - Hi.\\
422 - Hi.\\
423 - Your dad's really weird.\\
424 - You have no idea.\\
425 - You want to eat lunch together tomorrow?\\
426 - Okay.\\
427 - Bye.\\
428 - Bye.\\
429 - Sorry to bother you.\\
430 - I'm Claire's sister, Donna.\\
431 - Oh, hi. Hi.\\
432 - Come on in.\\
433 - I don't want to impose.\\
434 - I just want to thank you for being so nice to my sister.\\
435 - She often spoke of you.\\
436 - Oh. Well, you know, I thought the world of her.\\
437 - Come on now, Lois.\\
438 - I think we both know that Claire required a certain amount of patience. Am I right?\\
439 - Anyway, you wouldn't believe the flight I took coming here.\\
440 - First, they grounded the plane, which, you know, you think, better they do that than trying to fly it with something wrong.\\
441 - Then they said they're going to fix it, and I'm thinking, oh!\\
442 - You know, Donna, I'm sorry, but you happened to catch me at a really busy time.\\
443 - Oh, you think you're busy, try planning a funeral.\\
444 - Not that I'm complaining...

12 - That's where they get you, son.\\
13 - See, it says $12.99, but that doesn't include the hidden costs.\\
14 - Shipping, handling, box tops...\\
15 - By the time you're through you're paying on the high side of $15.\\

22 - Well, don't you think it would be nice to get a little dressed up for it?\\

35 - Wow, everyone's taking these yearbook pictures pretty seriously, huh?\\
36 - Are you kidding?\\
37 - This is how everyone's going to remember us for the rest of our lives.\\

39 - I mean, our children are going to look at these pictures years from now to see what we used to be like.\\

48 - I see that a lot with you scrawny ones.\\
49 - No, that's not...\\
50 - Come on, Chachi, let's get it over with.\\
51 - I made a mistake. I'd like to re-sched...\\
52 - Take that, society.\\
53 - Next!\\
54 -        ,    .                   ?\\
55 -       !\\
56 -                                 ,       I didn't know what time it was,\\
57 - and then I was late for a spelling test because I didn't know what time it was,\\
58 - and then David Klausner beat me up because I didn't know what time it was!\\
59 - You want to know what time it is, Dewey?\\
60 - It's half past a roof over your head, clean clothes, and three meals a day.\\
61 - That's what time it is!\\
62 - Let me tell you something, Mom.\\
63 - The roof leaks, the clothes are hand-me-downs, and the food stinks!\\
64 - -Room! -Dirty.\\
65 -                 .\\
66 - Our credit card company sent us a collection notice and an application for a new card.\\
67 -     ,         !\\
68 -             ?\\
69 -                          $10,000!\\
70 -      ?!\\
71 - You're joking!\\
72 - No, no, no! It says it's from a McClellan Fellowship Genius Grant to further his education...\\
73 - No strings attached!\\
74 - I can't believe it! This is fantastic!\\
75 -                  !\\
76 - I've never seen so many zeroes on that side of the decimal point!\\
77 - Can you imagine what he could do with that?\\
78 - Imagine what anyone could do with that!\\
79 - Imagine what we could do with that.\\
80 - What are you talking about?\\
81 -     .\\
82 - All I'm saying is that we can do a lot with this kind of money.\\
83 - -But it's not ours, Hal; it's Malcolm's. -Of course, it's Malcolm's.\\
84 - But we have to take a moment to think about what a teenager is going to do with $10,000.\\
85 - Well, you know he's just going to blow it all on Legos and penny candy.\\
86 - Besides, it's not like Dr. Braniac. He isn't gonna get a free ride to whatever college he wants to go to, right?\\
87 - I don't think I like where this is going, Hal.\\
88 - Lois, all I'm thinking about is protecting Malcolm.\\
89 - I mean, sure, he's got that brilliant mind, but right now it is being held hostage by gallons of crazy teenage hormones.\\
90 - All I'm saying is maybe we should hold onto this for a little while, before we decide what to do with it.\\
91 -   ,       ...\\
92 - Thanks, Mom, for letting me go to picture day dressed like this.\\
93 - You made me look like a total jackass!\\
94 - It's not your picture; you don't care what I look like.\\
95 -                         ?\\
96 -   .\\
97 - Geez, my feet are killing me.\\
98 - I told you, you gotta let the blood drip into your shoes.\\
99 - Once it coagulates, then it's like walking on puffy clouds.\\
100 - Look at all these people, sitting here, just waiting for death.\\
101 - Yeah, I'd like to show those animal rights whackos this place.\\
102 - This is exactly what would happen to cows if it wasn't for us.\\
103 - Wait here. I'm gonna get someone to sign for the delivery.\\
104 - Thanks for beating Hitler.\\
105 - Now we're gonna watch something else.\\
106 -             .\\
107 - This is pretty sweet.\\
108 - Man, it's true what they say old age is wasted on the old.\\
109 - Hal, there's nobody home.\\
110 - We can't be too careful.\\
111 - Meet me at the clothesline!\\
112 -          ,    ?          ,                 .\\
113 - You're acting like you have something to hide!\\
114 - What are you talking about?                       .\\
115 - Since when is it a crime to get some fresh air?\\
116 - No, I thought about it, and it is just wrong.\\
117 -                                                  .\\
118 - Besides, the check is made out to him. The bank probably wouldn't even...\\
119 - Put that away!\\
120 -   ,        ,                   !\\
121 -     ,             .\\
122 - No, we're not going to do this.\\
123 - Honey, you are looking at this all wrong.\\
124 - We will pay him back.\\
125 - We are like a bank.\\
126 - And banks don't give you back the same exact money that you gave them.\\
127 - They use it, and then pay you back with different money later on.\\
128 - It's what makes our economy the envy of the world.\\
129 - I don't know. It just seems wrong.\\
130 - Look at it as a forced savings plan.\\
131 - We're actually doing him a favor.\\
132 - Lois, I can honestly say that I was not a good father to Malcolm until I forged his signature on that check.\\
133 - And we're going to pay him back, right?\\
134 - Absolutely every cent we spend.\\
135 - Plus interest.\\
136 - With no hidden handling fees.\\
137 -     .\\
138 -      .\\
139 - Honey, we have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of here.\\
140 -     ,                .\\
141 - I'll follow in 30 seconds.\\
142 - Go on!\\
143 -      .          !\\
144 - Sorry, pal, you had your chance.\\
145 -   ! You have to take my picture again!\\
146 -     !\\
147 - I thought I didn't care what people think of me, but I do.\\
148 - I really do!\\
149 - Look, kid, I'm making 20 cents a head, and re-shoots come out of my pocket.\\
150 - That adds up to "I don't give a crap."\\
151 - Don't blame me that you're a no-talent clown who couldn't even cut it at Sears!\\
152 - I'm not going anywhere until you take my picture!\\
153 - Fine.\\
154 -            .\\
155 - Let's just get rid of some of that shine.\\
156 - What did you do?!\\
157 - I look terrible!\\
158 - It looks pretty good to me.\\
159 - But that's just one clown's opinion. Next!\\
160 - Aren't you the meat delivery guy?\\
161 - What the hell are you doing here?\\
162 - I, um...\\
163 - He's my grandson.\\
164 - He's here visiting me.\\
165 - Hi, Grandma.\\
166 - It's great to see you.\\
167 - You can drop the act, kid.\\
168 - I haven't lost my marbles.\\
169 - I just like seeing someone have some fun around here.\\
170 - Clothesline.\\
171 - I got an estimate for the new pipes!\\
172 - Think of it, Hal clean water, on demand,\\
173 - the decision of hot or cold water entirely up to us!\\
174 - Yes, well, we could spend the money on new pipes, or we could put a down payment on her.\\
175 - -Where did you get this? -At the boat show.\\
176 - Boat show?\\
177 - Lois, I was on my way to work, when all of a sudden I see this giant billboard for the boat show, only 60 miles away!\\
178 - Now I'm not saying there's an invisible hand guiding our lives, but what are the odds?\\
179 - We're not wasting the money on a boat.\\
180 - It's not wasting, it's investing!\\
181 - A boat is a money-maker, Lois.\\
182 - Do you know how many opportunities we have missed out on because we weren't traveling in the right circles?\\
183 - Where are all the connections being made,\\
184 - the elbows being rubbed, the deals going down?\\
185 - -The yacht club! -Forget it!\\
186 - We're not spending Malcolm's money on a boat.\\
187 - That's final!\\
188 - Lois...\\
189 - You're looking at this the wrong way.\\
190 - It's not Malcolm's money anymore.\\
191 - Until we pay him back, it's ours.\\
192 - All right, maybe I was reaching too far with the big one, but just take a look at these...\\
193 - Huh?\\
194 - You can choose the Wave Skimmer or the Weekender.\\
195 - What do you think?\\
196 - I like this one.\\
197 - Unbelievable!\\
198 - You know what's going on, Mom? How could he do this to me?!\\
199 - Malcolm, I know it looks bad, but let me explain!\\
200 - Don't try and stick up for him, Mom.\\
201 - Oh, Malcolm, I know he's not perfect, but I love him.\\
202 - You love my yearbook photographer?\\
203 -   .\\
204 - Well... maybe love is too strong a word for it, but he does great work.\\
205 - The guy's hired to take good yearbook pictures!\\
206 - Now my grandchildren are gonna look at my photo in 50 years and think that their grandfather was a dork!\\
207 - Well, then I'm going to have to rethink my feelings for him.\\
208 -        ?\\
209 - Uh, yes.\\
210 - 'Ello, Guv'nor.\\
211 -                        ?\\
212 -             .\\
213 -    ?\\
214 - Clothesline.\\
215 -                    ?\\
216 -            .\\
217 -      ?!\\
218 - -How did... -He just is!\\
219 - Look, it's isn't important how it happened. Let's just move on with this, okay?\\
220 - Look, Dewey, you understand we're not stealing this money.\\
221 - Every cent is going back to Malcolm. We're a bank.\\
222 - Yeah, well, this bank is getting a Rolex. A big one.\\
223 - That money is going towards new pipes for the house!\\
224 - She can spend her share any way she wants.\\
225 - And I'm spending my share on a Rolex.\\
226 - I think I've earned it.\\
227 - There are no shares! Listen to me!\\
228 - We are not splitting up that money!\\
229 - Who put you in charge?\\
230 - Yeah, who put you in charge? Let's vote.\\
231 - There will be no voting!\\
232 - I vote there's voting.\\
233 - Me, too.\\
234 - -I'm going to get the money. -It's not there anymore.\\
235 -                .\\
236 -        .\\
237 -                                                .\\
238 -                         .\\
239 -      ?\\
240 - I was the one who came up with this idea... -The money is safe.\\
241 - Give it!\\
242 - And that...\\
243 - is the French Tuck!\\
244 - I don't know. It sounds to me like he was asking to be beaten up.\\
245 - That's what I said!\\
246 - Just because you're a crossing guard, you're suddenly off limits?\\
247 - "Walk, don't walk..."\\
248 - Who the hell is he to boss me around?\\
249 - It's nice to see someone with a little spirit.\\
250 - So many young people just lie about the house,\\
251 - just watching their Miami Vice and MTV's.\\
252 - Pie?\\
253 -               .\\
254 - I never knew old people could be nice.\\
255 - I thought you were all wrinkled bags of skin babbling about how stuff used to cost less.\\
256 - No, some are like that, but there's a few of us who still have some life left.\\
257 - Who's the geezer?\\
258 -            .\\
259 - Handsome, isn't he?\\
260 - You want me to push you over to him?\\
261 - No, I don't think that would be a good idea.\\
262 - See, we're not allowed to have romances around here.\\
263 - It's as if they don't think we're capable of having feelings anymore.\\
264 - That is totally unfair!\\
265 - I mean, as long as the two of you can see each other naked and still keep your lunches down,\\
266 - you should be able to do whatever it is you want to do.\\
267 -             .\\
268 - Okay, I alphabetized all the seniors' names,\\
269 - helped lug your equipment for three days from here to your shop\\
270 - and I held the lights for those creepy photo shoots.\\
271 - You have to take another picture of me.\\
272 - You held up your part of the bargain, I'll hold up mine. Sit down.\\
273 -             !\\
274 - Chin to the left...\\
275 - Square your shoulders...\\
276 -        !\\
277 - What did you do to me?!\\
278 - I look like a freak!\\
279 - Kid, that's you.\\
280 - That's what you look like.\\
281 -                                          !\\
282 -                     !\\
283 - Put on a special filter, or-or brighter lights...\\
284 -      ,              !\\
285 -           ,      .           -       ,                     .\\
286 -                       ,             .\\
287 - Where have you been?\\
288 -        .\\
289 - That story better hold up, Mister.\\
290 - Your father wants to count the money again.\\
291 - I just think we all get along better when we know it's all here.\\
292 - By the way, I'm going to need some of this.\\
293 - I got an estimate to fix my transmission.\\
294 - This receipt is from 1986, Hal! I can see where you erased the date!\\
295 -        .\\
296 - Oh, yeah? Well, how do I know this plumber's for real, and not just some actor that you hired?\\
297 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I held auditions while you were at work, Hal!\\
298 - I knew it!\\
299 - Listen to yourself! You've gone insane!\\
300 - That would be pretty convenient for you, wouldn't it?\\
301 - Well, you are not locking me away!\\
302 - I haven't trusted either of you since I was six!\\
303 - All right, all right, let's just split it.\\
304 - Three ways, and we'll all be happy.\\
305 - I wouldn't say happy, but it's a start.\\
306 -           -          .\\
307 - We just stop this nonsense and give the money back to Malcolm.\\
308 - Okay, you can have your pipes.\\
309 - No, Hal, this isn't a bargaining tool.\\
310 - This money has turned us into animals.\\
311 - I'm going down to the bank tomorrow morning and getting a cashier's check in Malcolm's name.\\
312 - Then the three of us can slink away and forget that this whole thing ever happened.\\
313 - Can't you control that woman?\\
314 - Watch your tone, young man!\\
315 - Or else what?\\
316 - You'll just cave, like you did with Mom.\\
317 - All right, that's it! Go to your room!\\
318 - I think maybe we should both go to our rooms.\\
319 - Fine!\\
320 - Code blue! Code blue!\\
321 - I think some of these are Viagra. Go for it.\\
322 - What can we do to repay you?\\
323 - Give me a five-minute head start.\\
324 - Honey, we want to apologize.\\
325 - Yeah.\\
326 - You were right.\\
327 - We were turning into monsters.\\
328 - The bad kind.\\
329 - You're just so much stronger than we are.\\
330 - Thank God for your levelheadedness.\\
331 - Thank God there was someone in this house who was able to keep their sanity.\\
332 - And you taught us a lot of important lessons about...\\
333 - honesty and trust.\\
334 -  ...\\
335 - if you'll just tell us where you hid the money...\\
336 - I've done something very bad.\\
337 -      ?\\
338 - There was this antique store across the street from the bank.\\
339 - And I saw this dollhouse in the window.\\
340 - And the next thing I knew, I was walking out with it.\\
341 - It was like that money in my pocket killed the old Lois\\
342 - and replaced her with a crazy person...\\
343 - It's okay, honey. I mean...\\
344 - So what if you spent a couple hundred dollars on a dollhouse? It's no big deal.\\
345 - Now where's the rest of the money?\\
346 - There isn't any.\\
347 -      ?!\\
348 - You-You spent ten thousand dollars on a stupid dollhouse?!\\
349 - They wanted 12.\\
350 -       ,    ...\\
351 - it has a tiny little dumbwaiter, and the lights really work.\\
352 -        ,       .\\
353 -     ,        ,     .\\
354 -                                         ,                    .\\
355 - It felt good to do something nice for a change.\\
356 - I'm seriously thinking about peppering that into my repertoire.\\
357 - Are you the one who helped Judith and Teddy get together yesterday?\\
358 - Yes, I am, and I would do it again.\\
359 -                          .\\
360 - I mean, who does it hurt to let two old people be happy?\\
361 - You whore!\\
362 - You stole my husband!\\
363 - No, I just used him without your permission and gave him back to you...\\
364 - Just like someone did with my sewing machine.\\
365 - Look at her.\\
366 - I couldn't say no! How can you say no to that?\\
367 - Oh, shut up, you old fool!\\
368 - Wait! I can fix this!\\
369 - Just get back at him by sleeping with someone else!\\
370 - How about him?\\
371 - When he has his teeth in, he's quite the looker!\\
372 - Okay, I sold my car.\\
373 - Well, we'll add that to what I got for my engagement ring and my grandmother's pearls.\\
374 - No one wanted to buy my bike, but a bunch of kids did pay to watch me eat a centipede.\\
375 - We're doing the right thing.\\
376 - We should all remember that.\\
377 - Quit sermonizing.\\
378 - I'll get enough of that from the nut-jobs on the bus.\\
379 - You guys aren't gonna believe it!\\
380 -                           $3,857!\\
381 -               ,        !\\
382 -             ,     .\\
383 -   ,             .\\
384 - This couldn't have come at a better time!\\
385 - I know exactly what I'm gonna do with it!\\
386 - *Beverly Hills*\\
387 - *That's where I want to play*\\
388 - *Living in Beverly Hills*\\
389 - Let's see them call me a dork now.

3 - For the love of God!\\
4 - We should have left for the airport nine minutes ago!\\
5 - Dewey's in this big-deal piano competition in St. Louis this weekend.\\
6 - It's being held at a huge, fancy hotel.\\
7 - Prominent musicians from all around the world are going to be there.\\
8 - And the best part is, Reese and I don't have to go.\\
9 - This is unbelievable!\\
10 - She's leaving us alone in the house for the whole weekend!\\
11 - She's losing it!\\
12 - Shh. Don't remind her. Be cool.\\
13 - ...Four, and Dewey's makes five...\\
14 - I still feel like I'm forgetting something.\\
15 - Okay, listen, they're not likely to do another Patrick Swayze festival for four, maybe five years,\\
16 - so I'm counting on you to tape the whole thing.\\
17 - Let's go!\\
18 - We still have to drop Jamie off at Mrs. Foley's.\\
19 - I still feel like I'm forgetting something.\\
20 - Hi, Mom. I thought we were gonna miss you.\\
21 - Be careful with those bags, you cow.\\
22 - Hi, Raduca.\\
23 - Family, howdy.\\
24 - You're here to work, not gossip like a fishwife.\\
25 - What's Grandma doing here?!\\
26 - You never said Grandma was coming!\\
27 - Oh, I didn't?\\
28 - Ah, well, then, it's just a nice surprise for you boys.\\
29 - Remember last month when you came in after curfew and you said, "What are you going to do about it?"\\
30 - Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.\\
31 - These are sex organs of four different animals.\\
32 - And a little oregano.\\
33 - Reese, I've watched you grow all these years.\\
34 - You are the one hope for this family.\\
35 - I just pray you are ready to become a man.\\
36 - Hey, what was that for?\\
37 - You are ready.\\
38 - Dewey, slow down.\\
39 - No, we have to get to Gate Seven or we'll miss our connecting flight.\\
40 - Oooh. Cinnabons!\\
41 - No! No Cinnabons, no bretzels, no frozen yogurt.\\
42 - You can raid the mini-bar when we get to the hotel.\\
43 - Do I have your permission to go to the bathroom?\\
44 - No. If you go to the other side of the partition,\\
45 - then we'll all have to go through security again.\\
46 - Dad, you tell her.\\
47 - Dad?\\
48 - Ooh, it's Paris.\\
49 - It's even more beautiful than I imagined!\\
50 - In our country, after a boy turns 16, he becomes a barochi.\\
51 - We watch this boy for one year.\\
52 - Then, when he is ready, he is plucked from is mother's teat\\
53 - and thrown into the town square,\\
54 - where he must battle with the other boys for dominance.\\
55 - Wait, up until this point, they're still breast feeding?\\
56 - It keeps families close.\\
57 - The boys fight each other with all their might.\\
58 - When it is over, the one left standing is the man.\\
59 - The rest are dronska.\\
60 - Then more breasts are offered to the proud young man.\\
61 - But these are not the withered spigots of the mother, no.\\
62 - These are the ripe, inviting pleasure domes\\
63 - of the virgins of the village, presented dripping with wine.\\
64 - Our family comes from the coolest country in the world.\\
65 - And it must continue, Reese.\\
66 - You must carry on with this ritual.\\
67 - Grandma, this is not only moronic, it's impossible.\\
68 - For one thing, there is no village full of boys for Reese to fight.\\
69 - No, we will have to make do.\\
70 - -The closest thing we have to a boy is you. -What?\\
71 - You shall be the rock on which his knife is sharpened.\\
72 - There will be contests of strength and endurance.\\
73 - When he defeats you, he shall be a man.\\
74 - What if I defeat him?\\
75 - And once you are a man, you shall get this.\\
76 - The whole plate of potatoes?\\
77 - You will take Raduca for your bride.\\
78 - You mean...\\
79 - Like I marry her? Now?\\
80 - That is why I brought Raduca to this country.\\
81 - You brought her here six months ago. She's been working as your slave.\\
82 - I should get something for my trouble.\\
83 - Grandma, you can't take two teenagers who've never met each other and force them into some sham marriage.\\
84 - That's not the way things work in civilized countries.\\
85 - If I get a wife, does that mean I get to have sex?\\
86 - So much sex you won't believe it.\\
87 - I'm in.\\
88 - Well, Dad, this makes it all worth it.\\
89 - They never have "Dewey"s.\\
90 - Look, there's no one there.\\
91 - Ma'am, we need you to get back in line.\\
92 - We're just trying to get in the empty one.\\
93 - That line is for first class and commodores club passengers only.\\
94 - Excuse me?\\
95 - Mom, we need to make this flight.\\
96 - So, this airport's policy is that increased security should only inconvenience poor people?\\
97 - I don't make the rules, ma'am.\\
98 - No, no one makes the rules.\\
99 - Why would anyone want to take responsibility?\\
100 - Mom!\\
101 - Ma'am, step over here, please.\\
102 - I know what it is. It's the underwire on my bra. It always sets these things off.\\
103 - You seem to have something under your shirt.\\
104 - Yes, as I said,\\
105 - I have a bra on under my shirt, and there is an underwire in my bra.\\
106 - Code 25.\\
107 - I can't believe this is the first underwire to come through this place.\\
108 - Surely you people have encountered bras before.\\
109 - This is punishment for what I said about the first-class line, isn't it?\\
110 - Ma'am, I need to touch your breasts.\\
111 - You need to touch my what?!\\
112 - I'm required to probe with the back of my hand.\\
113 - If you like, you can request up to two female witnesses.\\
114 - Let me understand this.\\
115 - Because I made a comment about first class, I am being singled out for a public feel-up?\\
116 - Oh for God's sake, Mom, just let her touch your boobs!\\
117 - The kid makes a lot of sense, ma'am.\\
118 - Now, do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way?\\
119 - Okay, the tickets are changed. The next flight leaves in 15 hours.\\
120 - So I get no time to practice and no sleep tonight.\\
121 - You should have seen what happened the first time I touched 'em.\\
122 - No, I'm canceling everything. I'm chartering a helicopter and getting out of...\\
123 - Sorry. Oh, I...\\
124 - What? No, I just tripped over some stupid kid that was playing around the floor.\\
125 - I'm sorry... I-I'm so sorry.\\
126 - Two boys enter, one man emerges.\\
127 - You must beat him at every contest...\\
128 - or there will be no bride for you.\\
129 - I really appreciate you doing this for me.\\
130 - Listen, moron, I'm not doing this to help you get married.\\
131 - I'm gonna try to win to keep you from flushing your life down the toilet.\\
132 - We begin with the Trial of Pain.\\
133 - Raduca, the strings.\\
134 - This trial teaches an important lesson.\\
135 - Until you can ignore your own pain, you cannot truly ignore the pain of others.\\
136 - The first one to take two steps backwards is the victor.\\
137 - I don't get why this is supposed to hurt so much.\\
138 - Go.\\
139 - I didn't think anything above my waist could be so sensitive.\\
140 - Why don't you want me to be happy?!\\
141 - I'm only doing this because I love you!\\
142 - Must...\\
143 - take... mind off...\\
144 - ear pain!\\
145 - The victor!\\
146 - That was so easy!\\
147 - I barely worked up a sweat.\\
148 - May I help you?\\
149 - Oh, hi, yes.\\
150 - It kills me to have to do this, but I'm gonna return this.\\
151 - No... please, Mr. Saunders, don't do that.\\
152 - I implore you.\\
153 - We know our service got a little slack last year, but we have improved.\\
154 - We have expanded the buffet.\\
155 - Before you make a decision, let us get you a massage or a manicure.\\
156 - We have complimentary 30-year-old Scotch and a full bar.\\
157 - Can't we please, please, persuade you to give us another chance?\\
158 - Well, all right.\\
159 - But let's not have a repeat of last time.\\
160 - You are now one step closer to your manhood.\\
161 - The next trial takes place within the Sack of Fellowship.\\
162 - Once inside the sack you will face a choice:\\
163 - To work together or to fight each other.\\
164 - If you work together, you'll both lose.\\
165 - So now what happens?\\
166 - I don't know.\\
167 - I'm still trying to figure out why there's a dog in here.\\
168 - Grandma, what are we supposed to do?\\
169 - Just get out.\\
170 - -That's it? -That's it.\\
171 - Okay, Reese, you beat me fair and square.\\
172 - Just-Just help me get out...\\
173 - How's it going, sport?\\
174 - Fantastic. I've been practicing for hours.\\
175 - Of course, I'm screwed if we have to play on real pianos.\\
176 - Ah, buck up, son. We're all sacrificing.\\
177 - Why are your nails shiny?\\
178 - No reason.\\
179 - Can I at least have a dollar for the soda machine?\\
180 - Nope. All gone to the great tip fairy.\\
181 - Boy, these chairs are hard.\\
182 - Stop, thief!\\
183 - I'm sorry!\\
184 - -You crushed my fingers. -I didn't mean to. Let me see.\\
185 - Look what you did to me.\\
186 - Keep the fingers elevated, Dewey, and don't worry.\\
187 - I know where I can find some Evian ice.\\
188 - Cool!\\
189 - Grandma's got props for the next one.\\
190 - I'm done, Reese.\\
191 - I'm not going through any more of these trials.\\
192 - What's the matter?\\
193 - I thought we were finally doing something as a family.\\
194 - If you want to let that crazy old bat ruin your life, fine.\\
195 - Knock yourself out.\\
196 - How is she ruining my life?\\
197 - She's getting me a bride.\\
198 - A female bride.\\
199 - I mean, what are the odds that a girl is ever going to want me?\\
200 - You can get a girl, Reese.\\
201 - If you just didn't act like a vicious, stupid thug all the time.\\
202 - Come on, Malcolm, let's be realistic.\\
203 - Grandma, Malcolm doesn't want to play anymore.\\
204 - So I guess I win by forfeit.\\
205 - What?!\\
206 - You cannot become a man by forfeit.\\
207 - You must go through all the trials.\\
208 - You must win every one.\\
209 - But they're your rules. Can't you just change them?\\
210 - These are not my rules. These are the ways of our people.\\
211 - -The ways cannot die. -Yes, they can.\\
212 - They should.\\
213 - They should be murdered and mashed up and\\
214 - dumped down a salt mine along with nuclear waste and left there\\
215 - to fester and rot in a toxic pool of its own filth!\\
216 - Your pretty words don't hide your fear.\\
217 - What?!\\
218 - You are afraid of the next trial because it is a test of intelligence.\\
219 - You are afraid to find out who is really the smart one in the family.\\
220 - He goes around with his nose in a book, sucking in facts.\\
221 - He doesn't have what we have.\\
222 - You and I have street smarts.\\
223 - Oh, here we go.\\
224 - Every moron who's willing to act like a criminal is loaded with street smarts.\\
225 - Well, let me tell you something, Grandma, you're either smart or you're not.\\
226 - Saying you have street smarts just means you're willing\\
227 - to do things that smart, sensitive people are too decent to do.\\
228 - That's not a sign of intelligence.\\
229 - It's not.\\
230 - It's not!\\
231 - I promise to always love and respect you.\\
232 - As long as you stay in a 20-pound weight range.\\
233 - Arturo, I would be a dead man without you.\\
234 - Mr. Saunders.\\
235 - Please. Mr. Saunders is my father.\\
236 - You can call me...\\
237 - what my first name is.\\
238 - If you'll just follow me.\\
239 - Now, do I disrobe for a salt glow, or just strip to the waist?\\
240 - Sit down here.\\
241 - Our teleconference service was down for an hour.\\
242 - I'm sorry it took so long to set up, but everyone's ready for you now.\\
243 - London, Berlin, Tokyo.\\
244 - Tokyo?\\
245 - Mr. Saunders, we finally meet face to face.\\
246 - Yes, uh...\\
247 - Well...\\
248 - Hi, there.\\
249 - I'm afraid we can't wait for your reply any longer.\\
250 - We need an answer from you.\\
251 - You need an answer from me?\\
252 - We have five governments involved.\\
253 - If you can't decide, we shall have no choice but to sever all ties.\\
254 - That means Malaysia, that means Taiwan, that means the entire eastern sector!\\
255 - We need you to choose now, sir.\\
256 - Is it yes... or no?\\
257 - Okay, um...\\
258 - Just...\\
259 - Fine. You have us at a disadvantage.\\
260 - We will wire another six million into your account.\\
261 - All right, then.\\
262 - The answer is yes.\\
263 - Very good.\\
264 - We'll begin shipping the antidote at once.\\
265 - Excellent.\\
266 - By the way, Are-Are we...\\
267 - good guys?\\
268 - Hey, honey.\\
269 - What have you been doing?\\
270 - Well, I can honestly say I have no idea.\\
271 - -Do you want me to...? -No.\\
272 - Stupid hot sauce.\\
273 - You okay?\\
274 - Dewey's been absolutely horrible to me.\\
275 - I know we missed the flight, I know I hurt his fingers,\\
276 - I know this isn't the greatest day of his life, but\\
277 - he's been acting like I'm trying to ruin his contest on purpose.\\
278 - Well, honey, it has been an awful lot of stuff in a row.\\
279 - What are you saying, Hal?\\
280 - You agree with him?\\
281 - You actually think that I would...?\\
282 - This is the final test.\\
283 - The game of Vishnok will show us who has the brains around here.\\
284 - -Grandma, how do we play? -Shh!\\
285 - You will listen!\\
286 - The rabbits run to their lair.\\
287 - The moon embraces you.\\
288 - The horse turns to lead.\\
289 - The apple holds the key.\\
290 - You have two minutes.\\
291 - What are we doing?\\
292 - I don't know.\\
293 - -Did you feel this? -What?\\
294 - The rabbits run to their lair.\\
295 - The moon embraces you.\\
296 - The horse turns to lead.\\
297 - The apple holds the key.\\
298 - Ha! I beat him! It's over!\\
299 - ...proski, verontut...\\
300 - The marriage is off.\\
301 - After 2,000 years your ways are dead.\\
302 - I am content the ways have been followed.\\
303 - What?!\\
304 - No. No, you don't get to pretend you're okay with this.\\
305 - I never followed your ways.\\
306 - Well, I did, but it was for a different reason...\\
307 - Pack up my things, cow. We leave in five minutes.\\
308 - No, wait.\\
309 - Don't go!\\
310 - I got two out of three.\\
311 - There must be some way I can marry Raduca.\\
312 - It is impossible. You're not a man.\\
313 - The most you can ever hope to be now is a very butch woman.\\
314 - Well, I'm going to marry her anyway!\\
315 - It is forbidden.\\
316 - The ways don't allow you.\\
317 - Well, then from now on, I reject your ways forever!\\
318 - Listen, I'm not the perfect guy.\\
319 - I might not even be a good guy.\\
320 - But if you marry me,\\
321 - we'll both be certain for the rest of our lives that I never could have done any better.\\
322 - She will never marry a dronska like you. She's a good girl.\\
323 - I will marry you.\\
324 - -I forbid you to do this! -You cannot forbid me.\\
325 - I am American girl now.\\
326 - I have iPod.\\
327 - I wear thong.\\
328 - I shave!\\
329 - Hide your shame, whore!\\
330 - You can't talk to my wife that way.\\
331 - I'm going to spend the rest of my life with the woman I probably love.\\
332 - Well, apparently only permanent blindness gets you bumped up to first class.\\
333 - Well, the redness is going down.\\
334 - I think you can compete just fine.\\
335 - Why don't you just cut the act, Mom?\\
336 - You got what you wanted.\\
337 - What are you talking about?\\
338 - You don't like watching me be successful, because it reminds you that you never did anything with your life.\\
339 - And now, instead of taking joy in your kids' accomplishments,\\
340 - you undermine us so we won't show you up.\\
341 - Maybe it's unconscious, maybe you know you're doing it,\\
342 - but that's what's been going on this whole trip.\\
343 - So what?\\
344 - Huh?\\
345 - You think you're the first kid in the world whose parents ever sabotaged him?\\
346 - Please, Dewey, parents undermine their children all the time.\\
347 - My dad told me I would never amount to anything and live a life of hardship and constant disappointment.\\
348 - Wait. We're talking about Mom.\\
349 - Well, you shouldn't be.\\
350 - This is your life.\\
351 - Crap flies at you. You got to learn to deal with it.\\
352 - Besides, which story would you rather tell...\\
353 - The one where you show up at a contest, play something and get a prize,\\
354 - or the one where your family torpedoes you and even though you are crippled and blind, you still come through to win first place?\\
355 - I guess the second one's a better story.\\
356 - Of course it is.\\
357 - Okay, Mom.\\
358 - Let's go to St. Louis.\\
359 - Damn straight. Let's win this thing.\\
360 - Wow, that Chinese kid was good.\\
361 - I have to hand it to you, Mom, having Grandma look after us sure kept us out of trouble.\\
362 - Where's your brother?\\
363 - In Vegas.\\
364 - I now pronounce you man and wife.\\
365 - I'll do everything I can to make you happy.\\
366 - As soon as we get home, I'm kicking Dewey and Malcolm out of the big bed.\\
367 - TO BE CONTINUED...
\subsection {Episode 12: College Recruiters (2)}
1 - There you go.\\
2 - Liver and beans again?\\
3 - It's all we had.\\
4 - You've done it again, honey.\\
5 - Jamie, I'm sorry if you don't like it, but I worked very hard to make this\\
6 - and nobody leaves until their plates are clean.\\
7 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.12 - "College Recruiters"\\
8 - Synchronisation par Max & Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
9 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
10 - Oh, I'll definitely call you back.\\
11 - Hold on. Let me get a pen.\\
12 - What's the number again?\\
13 - Great. I got it.\\
14 - I'll call you, I promise.\\
15 - If that wasn't a relative, I'm going to be very upset.\\
16 - It's just another college recruiter.\\
17 - Just another college recruiter?\\
18 - You know, when I was applying, believe me, there were no recruiters.\\
19 - If I hadn't found that ad inside that matchbook,\\
20 - I may not have pursued higher education at all.\\
21 - But they're calling me all the time.\\
22 - I must get ten calls a day.\\
23 - Then each one must be handled like that's the university you're going to.\\
24 - It's called options.\\
25 - Why do you think guys date ugly women?\\
26 - I swear I will to kill my mother!\\
27 - She just slinks down here and marries off my son to some Eastern European bimbo.\\
28 - The old reptile.\\
29 - I can't believe her leg hasn't grown back.\\
30 - Honey, calm down.\\
31 - No. I am going to kill her.\\
32 - You know, if young person dies, it looks suspicious.\\
33 - When old people die, it's just the way of the world. There's no investigation.\\
34 - Well, at least Reese is independent now.\\
35 - Independent?! He's living in our garage! How independent is that?\\
36 - I read about this old woman who drowned in her bowl of soup.\\
37 - -It happens. -Honey, look at the up side.\\
38 - Malcolm is going off to college, Francis is with Piama, now Reese is married.\\
39 - They've all flown the nest.\\
40 - We're done.\\
41 - We still have Jamie and Dewey.\\
42 - I'm all packed up.\\
43 - Good for you.\\
44 - Are you going somewhere?\\
45 - He's going to Francis's.\\
46 - Let's go over the rules again.\\
47 - When you are on a bus, what are you to do?\\
48 - Talk to no one, don't let anyone sit next to me, try to look sickly\\
49 - and learning-impaired, cough every few minutes and nose-picking's okay.\\
50 - Encouraged.\\
51 - And what if you are on the bus for a few hours and you have to go to the bathroom really, really bad?\\
52 - I still don't go.\\
53 - That's my boy.\\
54 - Mom, Dad, I would like to invite you to a garage-warming.\\
55 - Raduca thought that the least we could do is show our appreciation by treating you to a meal.\\
56 - -Well, I don't know what to say. -We would be delighted to come.\\
57 - What are we having?\\
58 - Looks like baloney, some kind of yellow cheese,\\
59 - half liter of Mountain Dew and...\\
60 - Wheat Crisps.\\
61 - Wonderful.\\
62 - Huh?\\
63 - This is where you live?\\
64 - Yeah.\\
65 - Where's Piama?\\
66 - Her sister's in prison.\\
67 - Or marrying somebody in prison.\\
68 - Whatever it was, she bought a dress.\\
69 - So what's the deal with the beard?\\
70 - Oh, this thing?\\
71 - I don't know. I was trying to find a job and not really finding anything and...\\
72 - kinda felt like something was holding me back.\\
73 - I think this makes me stand out from the crowd.\\
74 - Mission accomplished.\\
75 - So this is how you live?\\
76 - No fridge, no real furniture, and the only decoration's a stolen bus bench?\\
77 - Isn't that great?\\
78 - Francis, this is...\\
79 - everything I've ever dreamed of!\\
80 - This is exactly how I'll live when I grow up!\\
81 - Thanks, Dewey.\\
82 - You know, it's not easy to create this kind of lifestyle.\\
83 - Hey, you want to listen to some music?\\
84 - Sure.\\
85 - Hey, Kipler, turn that crap down!\\
86 - Feel that bass? That's a powered subwoofer!\\
87 - I'm not going to be mean.\\
88 - I'm going to very nicely tell them their marriage is a sham and must be dissolved.\\
89 - That might backfire. Look what happened when my mother tried that with us.\\
90 - And what choice do we have?\\
91 - We can't let them live like hobos in our filthy garage.\\
92 - So beautiful.\\
93 - Please to enter.\\
94 - Raduca, I have to say it is incredible what you've done with this place.\\
95 - No, no, no, this was Reese.\\
96 - He gets credit.\\
97 - Reese... you did this?\\
98 - He is very determined when you give him task.\\
99 - Now, sweetie, you can't give me all the credit.\\
100 - We both stomped that spider nest together.\\
101 - Ah, yes, honeymoon.\\
102 - I am very impressed.\\
103 - Is this homework?!\\
104 - Yeah, Raduca won't let me watch any television until it's finished.\\
105 - Wives. Am I right?\\
106 - Education is key to better life.\\
107 - Reese!\\
108 - Chair!\\
109 - I can't remember when I've had a baloney and Wheat-Crisp casserole this good.\\
110 - Reese has studying for green card exam.\\
111 - We must know every spouse's detail.\\
112 - Favorite color, toilet habit, my menstruation cycle.\\
113 - I think I'm done.\\
114 - Reese! Plates!\\
115 - Did you see the way she talks to him?\\
116 - She has broken his spirit.\\
117 - -He's not our Reese anymore. -I know.\\
118 - -It's fantastic. -Yeah.\\
119 - Here's our little scholar.\\
120 - What?\\
121 - Malcolm, this is Milt Anderson, a recruiter from M.I.T.\\
122 - Dad...\\
123 - We talked about this, and you're sitting here and listening to what he has to say, got it?\\
124 - But...\\
125 - Now, Malcolm, I know you've got a lot of questions.\\
126 - Yeah.\\
127 - You're from M.I.T.\\
128 - That's right. Mississippi Institute of Technology.\\
129 - What?\\
130 - Now, I know everybody always assumes it's Massachusetts.\\
131 - And hey, they do good work, too, but can they offer you\\
132 - the same kind of God-centric approach to science that we do?\\
133 - Now, I know you're a gentleman,\\
134 - and you're not going to want to make a decision until you come down and...\\
135 - taste some of the best catfish that ever melted into your mouth!\\
136 - Dad, could I talk to you for a second?\\
137 - Of course.\\
138 - Any chance you could air ship some of those ?\\
139 - Dad, this is a complete waste of time.\\
140 - I've already told you there are only four colleges in the whole world\\
141 - that have the nuclear biology programs that I'm interested in.\\
142 - And this M.I.T. and Kolumbia with a K aren't on the list.\\
143 - Maybe this isn't the school of your dreams, but you need a fallback position.\\
144 - Forget about it, Dad.\\
145 - This is my decision and I'm not talking to these bozos.\\
146 - All right, fine. I'll do it for you.\\
147 - But one day, you'll thank me.\\
148 - Uh, Milt, you'll have to excuse Malcolm.\\
149 - He, uh, had to do some... brain exercises.\\
150 - You know, mental squats and such. Anyway...\\
151 - tell me about your science department.\\
152 - Well, I'd love to. Let me just find my brochure.\\
153 - Here, why don't you take one of my key chains?\\
154 - It lights up!\\
155 - What else you got in there?\\
156 - I like that beer cozy.\\
157 - But I suppose it's either or.\\
158 - Why do we have to get a stupid green card anyway?\\
159 - I hate studying. It's so boring.\\
160 - Shut up and look at my breasts!\\
161 - This is the kind of thing that it will be on test.\\
162 - Note the number and the position of the beauty marks.\\
163 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
164 - Eyes down here!\\
165 - I'm sorry.\\
166 - That's okay.\\
167 - Sometimes it's better to see water slides from a distance.\\
168 - You make plans for a perfectly good time, and they go and fix the hole in the fence.\\
169 - I just wish I had the kind of money to buy us tickets.\\
170 - I would have lent you the six bucks.\\
171 - Hey, I don't roll that way.\\
172 - It's bad enough I'm letting my little brother buy me dinner tonight.\\
173 - So what do you want to do until then?\\
174 - We could wrestle.\\
175 - You want to wrestle for seven hours?\\
176 - You in there! Were is my rent?\\
177 - Mr. Banner, I can't open the door right now.\\
178 - Bark right now.\\
179 - It's my dog. He's crazy.\\
180 - And big.\\
181 - So, Greco-Roman or freestyle?\\
182 - Oh, no. No more studying. I need a break.\\
183 - Reese, what are you doing here?!\\
184 - What's that?\\
185 - Who's there?\\
186 - Raduca, who is this?!\\
187 - Um, this is, um, Bela, and I have known him for many years because...\\
188 - he is my brother.\\
189 - I can't believe you!\\
190 - You had your brother in town and don't tell me?!\\
191 - Get over here!\\
192 - Sorry I kept you boys waiting.\\
193 - I thought I had 4:30.\\
194 - You told me 4:30 a week ago.\\
195 - Boys, please, it's my fault.\\
196 - I've just had so many recruiters calling, they've got me coming and going.\\
197 - Tea?\\
198 - Waybridge, huh?\\
199 - Guess Nick beat us here.\\
200 - I just like the color.\\
201 - It doesn't mean anything.\\
202 - You know, Grandville has terrific sweaters.\\
203 - In fact, we have a collapsible umbrella people love.\\
204 - Please, it's not about merchandise.\\
205 - It's about education.\\
206 - Of course, it is easier to study when you're dry and toasty.\\
207 - You got it.\\
208 - Now... tell me about your respective universities.\\
209 - At Grandville, the head of our physics department just won a Nobel prize.\\
210 - That's very impressive.\\
211 - At Euclid, we think it's about results.\\
212 - For example, 70% of Euclid graduates take care of their parents in retirement.\\
213 - Oh, I like that.\\
214 - How can you keep those stats? Do you have no shame?\\
215 - Your Nobel prize was shared, okay?\\
216 - Your cyclotron in underfunded.\\
217 - How dare you!\\
218 - Boys...\\
219 - Excuse me.\\
220 - Hello.\\
221 - Oh, um, yes.\\
222 - Hi, Barry. Yes, I've been thinking about you, too.\\
223 - Listen, I can't talk.\\
224 - Is that Barry from Michigan?\\
225 - Well, never you mind who's here.\\
226 - Yes, I got your muffins.\\
227 - They were delicious and very thoughtful of you.\\
228 - Oh, stop! You are relentless.\\
229 - I hope I didn't keep you up last night with all that noise.\\
230 - Geez, Reese, I don't want to hear about your sex life.\\
231 - What?\\
232 - No, I was getting the oil stains out of the driveway.\\
233 - For your information, marriage isn't just about sex.\\
234 - It's about commitment.\\
235 - Anyway, you know we can't have sex until after the waiting period.\\
236 - The waiting period?\\
237 - Poor, naive Malcolm.\\
238 - All women, when they get married, require a waiting period of six months to a year.\\
239 - You know, if you got your nose out of a book, and started living life a little, you might know these things.\\
240 - Raduca is a delicate flower,\\
241 - and it's going to take some time for her to get used to the idea of being with a man.\\
242 - Who's that?\\
243 - Her brother Bela.\\
244 - Doesn't look much like her.\\
245 - Shows how much you know.\\
246 - I've never seen two people closer in my life.\\
247 - Mom, when  Raduca found out I took the food out of your refrigerator, she was pretty upset.\\
248 - She says we shouldn't be living off you.\\
249 - Really?\\
250 - I owe you 14 slices of bologna...\\
251 - a half a liter of soda...\\
252 - Reese, I was against your marriage from the beginning.\\
253 - I thought it was a mistake for you to be tied down so early in life.\\
254 - But, I see you and Raduca together and, I must say, I think she's good for you.\\
255 - You do?\\
256 - Why are you saying that?\\
257 - Well, I'm giving you my blessing.\\
258 - I see what's happening here.\\
259 - You're using reverse psychology.\\
260 - It's not working.\\
261 - No, I'm really just saying that I like her, and I like how you are when you're with her.\\
262 - Nice try, Mom, but I'm staying with Raduca.\\
263 - And I approve.\\
264 - You'd like me to think so, wouldn't you?\\
265 - Yes, I would.\\
266 - Well, I'm staying with her, Mom.\\
267 - Check and mate.\\
268 - Well, if you were worried about today's activities, you can just relax.\\
269 - My neighbors are on vacation, so good-bye, Seelys, hello, cable television.\\
270 - I have a better idea.\\
271 - There's a job center I thought we could go to.\\
272 - Oh, I get it.\\
273 - My little bro is worried about me.\\
274 - Maybe a little.\\
275 - Plus, cable is so overrated.\\
276 - Look, Dewey, I know it may seem like I don't have a lot going on, but I've got plenty of irons in the fire.\\
277 - Like my screenplay.\\
278 - It's only five pages.\\
279 - They're probably going to bring in some high-priced rewriter. Why should I do his work for him?\\
280 - Do you have any other irons?\\
281 - Look, I know it's tough to break into Hollywood. I'd be pretty stupid to rest everything on that.\\
282 - That's why I'm training a possum.\\
283 - To do what?\\
284 - Dial a phone, hop on one foot, walk like John Wayne...\\
285 - Stuff that people who visit roadside circuses like to see.\\
286 - So, does that put your mind at ease?\\
287 - Francis, you have to get a life.\\
288 - I have a life.\\
289 - I've got my hobbies, my bus bench, the guys at the apartment pool.\\
290 - I'm only 12, and I can see that this is a dead end.\\
291 - So you know what I should do better than I do.\\
292 - You're just like Mom.\\
293 - Maybe Mom has a point.\\
294 - Maybe just hanging out by the pool isn't going to be the stepping-stone you're hoping for.\\
295 - You never supported me!\\
296 - All I'm saying is jobs don't just drop out of the sky.\\
297 - I hate you!\\
298 - Fighting Irish or Golden Gophers?\\
299 - Blue and gold.\\
300 - Dad, I'm sorry.\\
301 - I know we fought about this, but,\\
302 - the truth is I'm actually glad you kept those college guys off my back.\\
303 - Well, son, it hasn't been easy.\\
304 - Today I've got two lunches, a coffee...\\
305 - Oh! And I'm going bowling with a guy from Yale.\\
306 - Thanks to you, I was able to clear my head and make my decision.\\
307 - No, you haven't.\\
308 - I have a lobster dinner next Tuesday.\\
309 - I've decided to go to Harvard.\\
310 - Harvard?\\
311 - I waited at that frozen yogurt shop for two hours, and he never showed!\\
312 - I just wrote a letter of early acceptance. I'm mailing it today.\\
313 - They can accept me as early as tomorrow, and all this will stop.\\
314 - Stop?\\
315 - Thanks again, Dad.\\
316 - It's a big relief to me.\\
317 - Harvard?\\
318 - You're destroying your life!\\
319 - Sorry, Francis.\\
320 - I guess visiting wasn't such a great idea.\\
321 - Thanks for trying to show me a good time.\\
322 - I only need bus fare to get home, so I'm leaving you the rest.\\
323 - Good-bye, Francis.\\
324 - Wait.\\
325 - Francis, you look great.\\
326 - Thanks.\\
327 - I realized you were right.\\
328 - For some reason, I'sitting around waiting for my life to start happening.\\
329 - I know that it's childish amd immature of me to think that some job is just going to fall out of the sky.\\
330 - Hey, man, what's up?\\
331 - Francis, you're never going to believe this! Hey.\\
332 - Remember how you were always telling us to "rock on"?\\
333 - Yeah, Travis. Rock on.\\
334 - That's what we did!\\
335 - And now they signed my band, Ass Bandit, to a record contract.\\
336 - We actually have a song on the radio, and we were wondering if you wanted to manage us.\\
337 - Really?\\
338 - Yeah, man! You were always there for us,\\
339 - borrowing our money so we couldn't get wasted on beer,\\
340 - taking our car so we'd be stuck here and have to practice all the time, and it totally paid off.\\
341 - Now we are going to tour Europe!\\
342 - You got to come with us, Francis.\\
343 - All you got to do is make sure the hotel rooms kick ass and the chicks are hot.\\
344 - I don't know...\\
345 - Sounds like a lot of traveling.\\
346 - Aw, what the hell?\\
347 - I'll do it.\\
348 - Tawny port.\\
349 - I want this to be a night to remember.\\
350 - I think it could be.\\
351 - Malcolm told me that he was very excited about Bagley-Owens University.\\
352 - Well, we're very excited about Malcolm.\\
353 - Are you really?\\
354 - Well, perhaps this will convince you.\\
355 - Oh, Vince...\\
356 - I don't know what to say.\\
357 - Just say, "Yes, Malcolm will be going to Bagley next fall."\\
358 - I'm such a mess, I can't even get it on my finger.\\
359 - Let me help.\\
360 - Dad...\\
361 - Malcolm, what are you doing here?\\
362 - What was my letter of intent to Harvard doing in your secret money drawer?\\
363 - Harvard?\\
364 - Is this true, Hal?\\
365 - You're damn right it is!\\
366 - I think this dinner's over.\\
367 - -Vince, I can explain. -I don't want to hear it.\\
368 - Good-bye, Vince.\\
369 - This is my decision.\\
370 - My future.\\
371 - You're a kid.\\
372 - You could change your mind. You just needed a cooling-off period.\\
373 - I almost married a Mexican woman two weeks before I married your mother.\\
374 - What are you doing?\\
375 - You're mortgaging my future for some dinners and a few sweaters?\\
376 - I got other stuff: ponchos, seat cushions...\\
377 - All right, I was going to let you make the final decision,\\
378 - I just liked the attention.\\
379 - No,no... I loved the attention.\\
380 - If I was a woman, I'd be a slut.\\
381 - You were just leading all these guys on.\\
382 - I know.\\
383 - It's just...\\
384 - Malcolm, I'm an average guy, in the middle of my life,\\
385 - in a job that can replace me in an hour.\\
386 - I was never an important man.\\
387 - You're the only important thing I've ever done.\\
388 - Oh, God!\\
389 - Don't feel bad, Dad.\\
390 - You raised me.\\
391 - You deserve the attention.\\
392 - No!\\
393 - Vince left the check.\\
394 - Reese, what's wrong?\\
395 - I got the results of our green card test in this envelope.\\
396 - But I just can't open it!\\
397 - I know I didn't pass. I totally panicked.\\
398 - Oh, Reese, don't be silly.\\
399 - These tests are for people who aren't living together. Who aren't in love.\\
400 - You have a real marriage. This is no problem.\\
401 - -But, Mom, what if I...? -You'll be fine.\\
402 - This is a mother's promise to her son.\\
403 - Oh, wow, Reese. I'm so, so sorry.\\
404 - Quit stalling! How did I do?\\
405 - The INS is denying Raduca's request for a green card.\\
406 - They're questioning the validity of your marriage.\\
407 - They want her to report to their office tomorrow.\\
408 - You said Raduca had a tail?\\
409 - Might have a tail!\\
410 - I don't know what the hell is going on back there! I was nervous.\\
411 - Reese, I feel just terrible.\\
412 - That's it.\\
413 - It's the end of my marriage.\\
414 - The one thing that was going right in my life is ruined.\\
415 - No, Reese. Nothing is ruined.\\
416 - If you love this girl, you'll find a way to overcome this obstacle.\\
417 - I don't know.\\
418 - Remember when I told you you couldn't keep that tarantula?\\
419 - Six months later, what did I find in my salad?\\
420 - My tarantula.\\
421 - You hung onto it because you loved it.\\
422 - And you love Raduca.\\
423 - We are not going to let the United States government smash her with a shoe.\\
424 - Come on.\\
425 - Let's go tell her we'll figure out a way to work this thing out.\\
426 - Oh, my God!\\
427 - How come your brother doesn't have a waiting period?!\\
428 - Dewey, I just got off the phone with your English teacher.\\
429 - She said you got an "F" on your paper.\\
430 - An "F"!\\
431 - You keep this up, you'll fail the class, which will go on your record,\\
432 - which will determine where you are placed in high school\\
433 - and where you will go to college, if anywhere.\\
434 - Don't go to college.\\
435 - It's okay with me.\\
436 - How do you think you're going to make your way in the world?\\
437 - You don't get it, Mom.\\
438 - Things take care of themselves.\\
439 - Rock on.

12 - After all those years of stepping on cracks,\\
13 - it finally paid off.\\
14 - I mean, it's no broken back, but I'll take it.\\
15 - Honey, come on. You'll have plenty of time to yell at the boys once you beat this thing,\\
16 - but right now you've got billions of germs inside of you that you need to focus your hatred on.\\
17 - Besides, you're highly contagious.\\
18 - Okay.\\
19 - Okay.\\
20 - Wait, what's on your face?\\
21 - I can't wait until everybody at school finds out you got the kissing disease from Mom.\\
22 - Which will happen right about...\\
23 - now.\\
24 - I didn't kiss her. You saw it.\\
25 - What I saw was you and Mom making out on the couch.\\
26 - Dewey?\\
27 - It was disgusting.\\
28 - She licked her finger and touched my face.\\
29 - Spare us the perv details.\\
30 - Okay, Jamie. Here we go.\\
31 - None of Mommy's monster germs are in here.\\
32 - But don't get too comfortable in the big boys' room. It's only temporary.\\
33 - He's never leaving, is he?\\
34 - What?\\
35 - No. This is just until it's safe to go back into our room.\\
36 - You said the same thing when Dewey moved in.\\
37 - Are you gonna take him back now that your ringworm's better?\\
38 - I told you we are still on yellow alert with that!\\
39 - Ready, Malcolm?\\
40 - Yeah.\\
41 - God, I hate sleeping on the couch.\\
42 - Oh, wait.\\
43 - No, no, no.\\
44 - We can't have you out there in the general population.\\
45 - Well, then, where am I gonna sleep?\\
46 - Right this way.\\
47 - Come on.\\
48 - Oh, God.\\
49 - Okay, I can get through this.\\
50 - I'll read books.\\
51 - I'll sleep a lot.\\
52 - I'll apologize in advance.\\
53 - I have gas to beat the band.\\
54 - Good job, Jamie.\\
55 - What the hell was that?\\
56 - He's my slave.\\
57 - You don't get to have a slave. You're my slave.\\
58 - Slaves can have slaves.\\
59 - This is America.\\
60 - Okay, I'll tell you what.\\
61 - I'll give you your freedom if you give me Jamie.\\
62 - Really?\\
63 - Your attitude's been pretty lousy lately.\\
64 - I know you've been spitting in my sandwiches.\\
65 - I mean, I still eat them, but now the trust is gone.\\
66 - Wait.\\
67 - Don't you have something you can read over there?\\
68 - I'm too tired to turn the page.\\
69 - Stick 'em up!\\
70 - Who wants a snack?\\
71 - Here we go.\\
72 - All right.\\
73 - A little bit closer.\\
74 - Sorry, just a minor setback.\\
75 - Hal, we're fine.\\
76 - Thank you for your trouble.\\
77 - Wait, don't eat it without the fun.\\
78 - Yeah.\\
79 - Just leave.\\
80 - Well, forgive me.\\
81 - I thought you might appreciate having some human interaction.\\
82 - You're in here every five minutes, when what we really need is rest. Hal, just go.\\
83 - Please, find something to do.\\
84 - Finally.\\
85 - Malcolm, quit hogging the covers.\\
86 - You're just like your father in bed.\\
87 - Hey, there.\\
88 - Look at you carrying that big leaf.\\
89 - All right. \\
90 - You'll be a hero when you walk in with that.\\
91 - The queen's not gonna tell you  to get out.\\
92 - Oh, hey, Steve.\\
93 - Steve, hey.\\
94 - Oh, hey, Hal.\\
95 - Hey, I was just, uh...\\
96 - So what's going on in your life, huh, fun stuff?\\
97 - Oh, no, no. You know me and Carol. Just boring, boring, boring.\\
98 - Just a stay-at-home couple.\\
99 - Yeah, me, too.\\
100 - Oh, Lois has mono.\\
101 - I've got her quarantined in the bedroom for two weeks.\\
102 - So she's really out of commission, huh?\\
103 - Oh, yeah.\\
104 - That's rough.\\
105 - And there's no chance she'll come out of it sooner?\\
106 - No, I'm afraid not.\\
107 - But thanks for asking.\\
108 - You know what?\\
109 - Uh, Carol and I are having a luau in about an hour.\\
110 - Just a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.\\
111 - Why don't you come by?\\
112 - Wow, you guys really do this up right.\\
113 - Well, they had to outdo a whole medieval feast\\
114 - at John and Stacy's and '70s Night at the Wongs.\\
115 - Wait...\\
116 - So...\\
117 - You guys do this all the time?\\
118 - Hal...\\
119 - I'm such a jerk. I never extend myself.\\
120 - I just get in my car. I go to work. I live in my own little world.\\
121 - I never think to knock on a neighbor's door and say, "Hey, let's have a luau."\\
122 - In fact, in fact, when Lois gets better, we'll do this at our house.\\
123 - Yeah, we should really talk about that at some point.\\
124 - You're right. I'm being pushy.\\
125 - Friendships develop over time.\\
126 - Yeah. Okay.\\
127 - No.\\
128 - No.\\
129 - No.\\
130 - No.\\
131 - God, no.\\
132 - No.\\
133 - No.\\
134 - We're staying.\\
135 - You said we both have to agree on something or we won't watch it.\\
136 - When you own your own house, you can make a rule and break it.\\
137 - That's not fair.\\
138 - Look at this boring leather jacket.\\
139 - Now look at the same leather jacket covered in brilliant scratch-resistant rhinestones.\\
140 - Oh, God. Get the remote.\\
141 - It's on your side.\\
142 - Fine, you want to watch the shopping channel all night, that's what we'll watch.\\
143 - Before now, this many rhinestones would have taken hours, even days to apply.\\
144 - But now there's the Pizzazzler!\\
145 - It'll change your life.\\
146 - See?\\
147 - That's what we need.\\
148 - Amen, we've been screwing around with medicine and bed rest when all we needed were some shiny beads.\\
149 - Quick, easy, fun and so simple to use.\\
150 - Do you think we could pizzazzle this thick wool peacoat?\\
151 - I don't think they can.\\
152 - Impossible.\\
153 - Pizzazz-yes!\\
154 - I didn't see that coming.\\
155 - Works on denim, satin, leather, pleather...\\
156 - Look at that oven mitt.\\
157 - Oh, come on, it's got nothing on that wallet.\\
158 - Vinyl, suede, ultrasuede, even carpet.\\
159 - Pizzazzler,\\
160 - it'll change your life.\\
161 - You know, it actually has.\\
162 - He's broken. I'm taking you back as my slave.\\
163 - -What? We had a deal. -You gave me damaged goods.\\
164 - Look.\\
165 - Jamie, get me a soda and it'd better be cold,\\
166 - or I'm gonna brain you.\\
167 - See?\\
168 - It's not my fault you don't know how to work him.\\
169 - Jamie, get him a soda.\\
170 - All right, but you're doing that because I want you to, not because he wants you to.\\
171 - Make him think that, Dewey.\\
172 - Malcolm, this is coming out great.\\
173 - Do you think it's gonna be uncomfortable?\\
174 - Maybe, but you're gonna have to make sacrifices if you're gonna be pizzazzulous.\\
175 - Oh, well, I didn't think of it pizz-at way.\\
176 - Okay, I'm going over to Dave and Tina's.\\
177 - Everything okay in here?\\
178 - We're fine.\\
179 - Fizzazzine.\\
180 - Fizzazzine.\\
181 - Feeling mizzazzuch bizzetter.\\
182 - Are you taking your pills?\\
183 - Gizzo awazzay.\\
184 - Yeah, lizzeave us alazzone.\\
185 - Okay, well...\\
186 - Gizzazzood bizzazzye.\\
187 - What?\\
188 - Hal, you're not making any sense.\\
189 - That's really weird, Dad.\\
190 - Sorry.\\
191 - Feel better.\\
192 - Oh, I'll tell ya.\\
193 - I get no respect.\\
194 - No respect at all.\\
195 - This is the guy from the luau I was telling you about.\\
196 - He's hysterical.\\
197 - Ever notice that stop sign on Maple?\\
198 - Evidently, Mary Keller thinks it's a slow-down-and-check-for-cops sign.\\
199 - That Hal is so great.\\
200 - Too bad he's stuck with that woman.\\
201 - That is right, Jay.\\
202 - She never stops there.\\
203 - I will terminate her.\\
204 - You know who'd be perfect for him? Ellie.\\
205 - - She's just coming out of that bad divorce. - Stop. That is terrible.\\
206 - Hey, ask me for a burger with cheese.\\
207 - I'll have a burger with cheese.\\
208 - You can't handle the cheese.\\
209 - I'll introduce them.\\
210 - Ellie, this is Hal.\\
211 - Hi.\\
212 - Hi.\\
213 - So, Carol tells me you're here on your own?\\
214 - Yeah, yeah. My wife kicked me out.\\
215 - Oh, that's terrible.\\
216 - So, are... are  you out of the house?\\
217 - No, no, no. I'm sleeping on the couch.\\
218 - But we're being smart about it.\\
219 - I mean, no contact at all.\\
220 - I think it's for the best, given our situation.\\
221 - Believe me, I know.\\
222 - Well, would you like to join me in a drink?\\
223 - My, oh, my. Do you think we'll both fit?\\
224 - It's so good to get out and meet all you great people.\\
225 - I have a confession to make. This is my first night out in a long time.\\
226 - I've been kind of a hermit lately.\\
227 - That was me, too, but now I wish I hadn't waited this long.\\
228 - I had no idea there was something so amazing right here on my block.\\
229 - Oh, Hal.\\
230 - Well, maybe we can do this again sometime.\\
231 - Well, Phil and Jenny are having a Mexican fiesta tomorrow.\\
232 - Are you asking me?\\
233 - Yeah, are you going?\\
234 - Sure.\\
235 - I'm sorry. I don't know how to do this.\\
236 - Just say good night.\\
237 - Good night, Hal.\\
238 - Good night.\\
239 - Russell makes a mean Singapore Sling.\\
240 - Oh, and you know that probate lawyer, Mrs. Chaffley?\\
241 - The one who's always on my ass about the lawn?\\
242 - Well, she can stand on her head and drink a pitcher of beer in seven seconds.\\
243 - Glad you had a good time, Hal.\\
244 - We're doing fine here, too.\\
245 - So, what do you wanna do now?\\
246 - You wanna Pizzazzle some more?\\
247 - No, I'm kinda Pizzazzled out.\\
248 - How about if I do your hair?\\
249 - Only if I get to do yours, too.\\
250 - Dizzeal!\\
251 - Thanks, little man.\\
252 - Aha! I see how you're doing it.\\
253 - You have a tack in your hand.\\
254 - Nope.\\
255 - That was just a pat on the head.\\
256 - So you're pushing the soft spot?\\
257 - No, Reese. I'm just being nice.\\
258 - So he doesn't know when the hit's gonna come.\\
259 - Reese, there's no trick.\\
260 - I'm just showing him respect.\\
261 - You're not making any sense.\\
262 - Don't overthink it.\\
263 - Oh, I got it.\\
264 - No, wait. I don't.\\
265 - He's my little brother.\\
266 - I'm just treating him the way I want to be treated.\\
267 - Show me the hand thing again.\\
268 - *Wishing and hoping and thinking and praying*\\
269 - *Praying and dreaming each night of his charms*\\
270 - *That won't get you into his arms*\\
271 - *So if you're looking to find love you can share*\\
272 - *All you gotta do is hold him and kiss him*\\
273 - *And love him and show him...*\\
274 - Oh, Hal, the last few nights have been so magical.\\
275 - The barbecue, the... disco party.\\
276 - Don't forget fondue night.\\
277 - I think I've gone up a whole pant size.\\
278 - I think I'm falling in love with someone.\\
279 - Wow, you know, you're pretty great.\\
280 - It wouldn't surprise me if he was falling in love with you, too.\\
281 - Well, good night.\\
282 - Good night.\\
283 - Good for her.\\
284 - I can do your nails again.\\
285 - I don't know what you could possibly do to improve them.\\
286 - Well, we have to do something.\\
287 - Truth or Dare.\\
288 - Truth.\\
289 - What's the worse thing you've ever done?\\
290 - Total immunity?\\
291 - Pinky swear.\\
292 - All right, well, I'm not sure if this counts,\\
293 - but when the Harrises were on vacation I drove their car for a week.\\
294 - Malcolm!\\
295 - It's not as bad as it sounds.\\
296 - They left their window unlocked.\\
297 - And a lot of people leave a spare car key in the kitchen drawer.\\
298 - Except the Goldmans.\\
299 - They left theirs in a fake soup can in the cabinet.\\
300 - Well, I'm off to Steve and Carol's... again.\\
301 - Fine, Hal.\\
302 - Hey, you know that Ellie Johnson down the street?\\
303 - She is a lot more fun than you think.\\
304 - I think she found a fella.\\
305 - Good for her.\\
306 - Should be a great party tonight. Steve's doing kabobs.\\
307 - Hal, I thought about it and it's just...\\
308 - too soon.\\
309 - Well, they did say 7:30.\\
310 - I mean, I'm not...\\
311 - ready.\\
312 - I hope you understand.\\
313 - Well, if you're not ready, you're not ready.\\
314 - You have such an amazing attitude, Hal.\\
315 - Don't ever lose that.\\
316 - So I guess I should just go.\\
317 - Good-bye, Hal.\\
318 - Good...\\
319 - Good-bye, Ellie.\\
320 - Okay, now say something nice to him.\\
321 - Like how you feel about him, but only good stuff.\\
322 - I don't know. He's...\\
323 - ...not that bad.\\
324 - Good. Now tell him that.\\
325 - You're not horrible like the rest of those buttmunches.\\
326 - There you go. Now pat him on the shoulder.\\
327 - It's like a slap, but slower.\\
328 - Good.\\
329 - Now see if he'll get you a soda.\\
330 - -Get me a soda! -No, no.\\
331 - Do it with me.\\
332 - Would you mind...\\
333 - Would you mind...\\
334 - ...getting me...\\
335 - ...getting me...\\
336 - ...a...\\
337 - ...a...\\
338 - ...soda?\\
339 - ...soda?\\
340 - -You stupid... -Nothing else.\\
341 - I just realized I totally lost sight of what's really important.\\
342 - There you go.\\
343 - It's not that I like having a slave getting me things.\\
344 - It's that I like to have a slave so I can watch him suffer while he gets me things.\\
345 - What?\\
346 - The fact that I had to ask for this makes it taste like bile.\\
347 - Thank you for helping me figure that out.\\
348 - What was that for?\\
349 - Sorry, man. I had to get the taste out of my mouth.\\
350 - I still can't believe you ate that dead fly.\\
351 - Hey, I play for keeps.\\
352 - All right, truth or dare?\\
353 - Truth.\\
354 - Remember when I was in fifth grade and I set the couch on fire?\\
355 - How'd you know it was me?\\
356 - I planted all that evidence, I had Stevie as an alibi. Even Dad thought it was Reese.\\
357 - Honestly?\\
358 - I had no idea.\\
359 - You were the first person I saw when I started yelling, and you just crumbled.\\
360 - You were bluffing,\\
361 - but you seemed so sure.\\
362 - Of course, I seemed sure.\\
363 - With you boys, if I showed the slightest weakness or hesitation the whole thing falls apart.\\
364 - Half the time, I'm just going on blind instinct.\\
365 - After all these years, five kids, keeping up that act.\\
366 - That's gotta be exhausting.\\
367 - Tell me about it.\\
368 - Plenty of days I come home tired from work.\\
369 - The last thing I wanna do is be Lois.\\
370 - I guess I do the same thing.\\
371 - Sometimes when I come home from school,\\
372 - I don't feel like arguing with you.\\
373 - But it's like that's my job.\\
374 - It's funny, isn't it?\\
375 - I bet half the time if we knew what the other one was really thinking, we'd just burst out laughing.\\
376 - We probably would.\\
377 - Where's Ellie?\\
378 - Oh, she said she just wasn't ready.\\
379 - Oh, yeah.\\
380 - Well, what a shame.\\
381 - But you know sometimes people just cling to these relationships that don't make sense to anybody else, right, Hal?\\
382 - What?\\
383 - Nothing.\\
384 - No, you clearly said something. What are you, what are you driving at?\\
385 - Well, it's just that, you know, you're so fun and Lois is so...\\
386 - Mojitos?\\
387 - No, no, mojitos. You were saying something about my wife, so let's just hear it.\\
388 - Well, um, this is nothing against you, Hal,\\
389 - it's just that your wife is kind of a...\\
390 - pill.\\
391 - What?\\
392 - Well, maybe that's your opinion, buddy, but that's not the opinion of everyone else here, is it?\\
393 - So that's how it is, huh?\\
394 - Well, let me tell you something.\\
395 - I think all of you people are just jealous!\\
396 - My wife happens to be the most wonderful,\\
397 - amazing, beautiful woman in the world, and I don't care to eat with anyone who thinks otherwise.\\
398 - See me cowering?\\
399 - This is how a slave acts.\\
400 - You'll get it. We'll both just have to be patient.\\
401 - Now, let's start at the beginning.\\
402 - "No, I won't get you a soda."\\
403 - Come on. Put some wrist into it.\\
404 - Wait, you're missing my eye. Get my eye.\\
405 - Oh, don't worry Hal, I'll take down the rhinestones.\\
406 - No, leave them. Last night was like making love inside of a star.\\
407 - You know, Hal, now that I'm feeling better you can take me to one of those great parties.\\
408 - Oh, I don't think so, honey.\\
409 - I never really fit in with those people.\\
410 - Well, if they don't appreciate you, I don't want anything to do with them.\\
411 - Oh, for the...!\\
412 - Who left the refrigerator open?\\
413 - Malcolm?!\\
414 - Sorry, Mom, I didn't...\\
415 - Mom, remember the...?\\
416 - What the hell are you laughing at? You think wasting electricity is funny?\\
417 - Not as funny as your pathetic parenting skills.\\
418 - -Isn't it interesting that you treat your kids like criminals... -Oh, well, why don't you just live on the street...\\
419 - - ...and they end up turning into criminals? You must be so proud. -...and see if a bunch of strangers will give you free, cold food?\\
420 - -You have all your kids afraid of you. Is that what you want? -That's all you want, free stuff, right?\\
421 - -You want me to be afraid of you? -You think everybody's just gonna give you...
\subsection {Episode 14: Hal Grieves}
1 - We are not stopping until we find that smell.\\
2 - Check out that black thing.\\
3 - Was that even food?\\
4 - I believe it was cheese at one time.\\
5 - No, that's not it.\\
6 - -Nope. -No.\\
7 - Hey, what about that?\\
8 - Oh, God!\\
9 - Isn't that the school rat that Dewey was taking care of last summer?\\
10 - No, that's not it.\\
11 - Malcolm in the Middle - 7.14 - "Hal Grieves" Synchronisation par Tyno, Script par Raceman. Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
12 - No, no, no, don't hang up. We've almost made our decision.\\
13 - I get three meat toppings for the price of one!\\
14 - No, no! Buy two pizzas, get one free!\\
15 - That's two free cheese pizzas!\\
16 - I'd rather eat vomit!\\
17 - The prospect of a deal sends this family into a frenzy.\\
18 - When you throw in pizza, they need me to keep from totally losing perspective.\\
19 - Shut up, everyone!\\
20 - Just shut up!\\
21 - If we're not having deep-dish, then I swear I will tear up these "free cheesy bread" coupons right now!\\
22 - Damn your cheesy bread! I need toppings!\\
23 - Why don't we just get the stuffed crust special?\\
24 - And lose my free bucket of soda? Are you insane?!\\
25 - Now, listen, Dennis, I'm a reasonable man,\\
26 - but I can't go back to my family with a lot of lawyer talk about coupon expiration dates.\\
27 - So why don't we just reduce the two three-fers to two-fers?\\
28 - Five toppings on each, and we'll just grandfather in the wacky wings, okay?\\
29 - No, no, hold on, hold on. This call-waiting guy will not take a hint!\\
30 - Hello. I can't talk right now. I...\\
31 - Yes.\\
32 - What?\\
33 - Dad, come on, you're gonna lose those wings!\\
34 - What?\\
35 - My father died.\\
36 - It was weird going to Grandpa's funeral.\\
37 - We hardly even knew we had a grandpa, and now we don't.\\
38 - Reese is taking it really hard.\\
39 - Why! Why!\\
40 - Why couldn't he die before he lost all his money?\\
41 - You okay?\\
42 - Yeah, I'm fine.\\
43 - Are you sure?\\
44 - It seems a little weird that the second you come home from your father's funeral, you turn on Sports Bloopers.\\
45 - Hey.\\
46 - Hal...\\
47 - It is not healthy to keep all this bottled up.\\
48 - I agree.\\
49 - I just don't have anything to unbottle.\\
50 - I mean, I thought I'd cry when I saw him in the box.\\
51 - I thought I'd cry when they closed it.\\
52 - I thought I'd cry when they put it in the ground and I threw dirt on him, but...\\
53 - nothing.\\
54 - Actually, I did get a little misty listening to the funeral we passed on the way out.\\
55 - Do you know that man was the shoeshine guy on the same corner for 40 years?\\
56 - Hal.\\
57 - You don't have to be brave.\\
58 - I'm not.\\
59 - You know me.\\
60 - I cried at that movie about the boxing wallaby.\\
61 - I remember.\\
62 - I think I'm not feeling anything because I never really had a relationship with him.\\
63 - I mean, I suppose he knew my name, but he'd always just call me "buddy."\\
64 - Oh, Hal.\\
65 - So, now a relationship that was totally meaningless and trivial is over.\\
66 - It's hard to get too upset.\\
67 - Hey, Lois. I'm returning the Newsweek you lent me on Y2K.\\
68 - It's okay, Abe. Hal's asleep.\\
69 - Good.\\
70 - How's he doing?\\
71 - Well, he seems to be doing fine, but he can't be.\\
72 - His father just died. He got more upset when his transmission gave out.\\
73 - Well, he did just have it rebuilt.\\
74 - But I know what you're saying.\\
75 - Sounds like he needs to talk to someone.\\
76 - Abe, thank you! I know he respects you.\\
77 - Not me. I don't want to see him cry.\\
78 - He needs to talk to a professional.\\
79 - A therapist?\\
80 - No, a professional actor.\\
81 - I suggest William Shatner, TV's Captain Kirk.\\
82 - What?\\
83 - That's who I turn to in a time of need.\\
84 - Lois...\\
85 - There's this wonderful service where they hook up ordinary people with celebrities.\\
86 - You pay a fee, and you get a phone call from your choice of participating TV or movie stars.\\
87 - Well, mostly TV stars.\\
88 - And you think this is something Hal would want?\\
89 - Absolutely! He's a huge fan of classic Trek.\\
90 - It's not something you share with your wife.\\
91 - Lois, believe me, I don't think I would've gotten through my social anxiety disorder\\
92 - without a few late-night discussions with Agent Mulder.\\
93 - It turns out the truth was right in here.\\
94 - Apparently, Shatner's not available.\\
95 - He's being knighted.\\
96 - Well, thanks for trying, Abe.\\
97 - Oh, it's not over yet.\\
98 - I am not going to rest until a classic TV star puts Hal's spirit at ease.\\
99 - I know you didn't love him, but this is a funeral. Don't you care?\\
100 - You kidding?\\
101 - About this guy?\\
102 - We weren't even close.\\
103 - Check it out.\\
104 - Now I'm happy.\\
105 - Now I'm sad.\\
106 - Oh, now I'm happy.\\
107 - Boo-hoo, now I'm...\\
108 - sad...\\
109 - Hey, dead guy, why are you hitting yourself?\\
110 - Who knew we could have fun with Dad?\\
111 - That's who that is?\\
112 - I thought it was, like, a math teacher or something.\\
113 - Why aren't you sad?\\
114 - Why aren't you throwing yourselves on my coffin and begging to be buried instead of me?\\
115 - Are you guys feeling as little as I am?\\
116 - I felt sadder when my wart fell off.\\
117 - I guess he just didn't make much of an impression on us when he was alive.\\
118 - Boys...\\
119 - Boys, don't go.\\
120 - Dewey, you always loved me.\\
121 - No, boys!\\
122 - Don't you miss me?\\
123 - I miss me.\\
124 - Wake up, boys! You don't want breakfast to melt!\\
125 - Ice cream?\\
126 - Last time I checked, you can't have a sundae bar without it.\\
127 - Wake up, Malcolm.\\
128 - Dad... it's 5:00 in the morning.\\
129 - Well, I couldn't sleep until my sons are as happy as I can make them.\\
130 - Today's special, every scoop comes with a hug!\\
131 - And it doesn't stop here.\\
132 - We've got a full day of pick-up basketball in the park, a barbecue, more ice cream,\\
133 - then I thought we'd take a nap underneath a tree, and then catch fireflies.\\
134 - What about school?\\
135 - I've got that covered.\\
136 - Please excuse my son. He has... the flu...\\
137 - explosive diarrhea...\\
138 - a rare bone disease...\\
139 - We may have to get you a cane.\\
140 - Cool!\\
141 - Does Mom know?\\
142 - Please, will you let me worry about your mom, okay?\\
143 - Seriously, though, don't tell her.\\
144 - Now,\\
145 - who wants a ride on top of the car?\\
146 - Abe, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm not sure...\\
147 - Lois, do you know what it cost me to get Leonard Nimoy's private number?\\
148 - Ferengi noses don't grow on trees.\\
149 - -Let's just... -It's ringing!\\
150 - Hello?\\
151 - Mr. Nimoy?\\
152 - This is he.\\
153 - We apologize for disturbing an important man like yourself.\\
154 - But my friend's father just died,\\
155 - and he could use some sage advice from a learned actor- director-poet-photographer-vocalist.\\
156 - I'm sorry, but in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\\
157 - was Ricardo Montalban the gentlemen he seems to be?\\
158 - Because a little birdy told me...\\
159 - Abe!\\
160 - I'd be happy to help your friend.\\
161 - It's very sad when a man loses his father.\\
162 - I've been through loss myself.\\
163 - Oh, that's very kind of you, Mr. Nimoy.\\
164 - I'm his wife.\\
165 - So will this be charged to your credit card?\\
166 - What?\\
167 - Well, that's eight dollars a minute for the Nimoy, and for another five,\\
168 - I'll leave an outgoing message on your answering machine as...\\
169 - Mr. Bob Hope!\\
170 - How about that Brooke Shields? She's got legs that go all the way down to the ground that I've got to tell you...\\
171 - Nimoy's Bob Hope is great.\\
172 - Is there nothing the man can't do?\\
173 - Hey.\\
174 - You doing okay?\\
175 - Oh, yeah, you know, I'll drop the kids off at school,\\
176 - maybe look through a photo album.\\
177 - Well, that's what bereavement days are for.\\
178 - I love you.\\
179 - I love you, too.\\
180 - Okay.\\
181 - I've got clear shot to the refrigerator.\\
182 - Who's gonna stop me?\\
183 - Nice.\\
184 - Pudding!\\
185 - It's your mother!\\
186 - Hurry up.\\
187 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
188 - God, I hate school.\\
189 - What's to eat in this dump?\\
190 - Good night, boys.\\
191 - Good night, Dad.\\
192 - What a day.\\
193 - Memorable, huh?\\
194 - And if you thought today was fun, tomorrow's gonna make it look like garbage.\\
195 - Quick question.\\
196 - If I died in my sleep tonight, who'd be sad?\\
197 - -I would! -Me! Me!\\
198 - Sure. Of course we'd be sad.\\
199 - You boys have just earned some s'mores.\\
200 - Back in a jiff.\\
201 - Wait, Dad.\\
202 - You don't have to do this.\\
203 - I think I know what's going on. If you want to talk about stuff...\\
204 - Malcolm, all I'm interested in right now is filling your bellies with marshmallowy goodness.\\
205 - -But, Dad... -Don't worry.\\
206 - I'll make yours double thick.\\
207 - This is so awesome.\\
208 - Yeah. I don't know what alien worm burrowed into Dad's brain, but I'd like to shake its hand.\\
209 - Don't you guys see what's going on?\\
210 - This is all because of Grandpa.\\
211 - Ever since he died, Dad's been feeling bad because he doesn't miss him enough.\\
212 - So now he's trying to compensate by bonding with us.\\
213 - That's just a lot of fancy language for all-you-can-eat s'mores.\\
214 - This isn't fun and games, Reese.\\
215 - He's got a real emotional problem.\\
216 - You think Dad could really be doing this to buy our love?\\
217 - I guess.\\
218 - I say we squeeze him for all he's got.\\
219 - It's the least we could do for him.\\
220 - Where's Dad?\\
221 - It was weird.\\
222 - I got up early this morning and found him sitting at the kitchen table\\
223 - looking at a picture of him and Grandpa with this peaceful smile on his face.\\
224 - Really?\\
225 - Yeah.\\
226 - Then he said he really worked some things out last night.\\
227 - And then he just took off for work.\\
228 - Hey, get your greedy mitts off my lunch!\\
229 - I was just moving it to get to my lunch.\\
230 - What lunch?\\
231 - Later.\\
232 - Oh, God.\\
233 - Get off me.\\
234 - Found you!\\
235 - Well, you have to admit it was a pretty good hiding place.\\
236 - I was in there for over an hour.\\
237 - I helped.\\
238 - And you should share the prize.\\
239 - Hey, where's Malcolm?\\
240 - He had to go to school.\\
241 - Yeah, he said this was stupid.\\
242 - Too bad. I guess he misses out on Motocross!\\
243 - Sweet!\\
244 - I mean,\\
245 - I guess it's okay.\\
246 - Come on. It'll be better than yesterday.\\
247 - What was yesterday?\\
248 - I can't quite remember. Can you, Dewey?\\
249 - I knocked you into pudding.\\
250 - I guess the problem with memories is that they fade.\\
251 - Especially in the minds of young people that are scrambled with video games and death metal.\\
252 - I can barely remember my own name.\\
253 - Hey, you know what doesn't fade?\\
254 - Things.\\
255 - Like these pants.\\
256 - I can still remember the crisp September day when Mom gave them to us.\\
257 - She had a little lipstick on her upper tooth.\\
258 - -Her eyes crinkled... -She smelled like lilacs.\\
259 - Hey, you know what?\\
260 - I can get you things.\\
261 - I don't know.\\
262 - You'd have to drive us to some kind of mall or something.\\
263 - You boys go get in the car.\\
264 - I'm going to call the credit card company and have them up my limit.\\
265 - Taken care of.\\
266 - Nice.\\
267 - It's just a shame I'll have to catch it with a dirty mitt.\\
268 - I want to remember how great you are in spring, summer, fall...\\
269 - and winter, too.\\
270 - Wow, Dad, you buy out the whole store?\\
271 - No one's got a better dad than us.\\
272 - Except Joe Garoogian.\\
273 - Dewey!\\
274 - You don't deserve to remember how good Dad is.\\
275 - You only deserve to remember me whacking the crap out of you.\\
276 - Not so fast, Reese.\\
277 - The boy's just being honest.\\
278 - Now tell me, what is it about this Joe's father that's so great?\\
279 - His dad's vice president of an electronics company.\\
280 - He can get any type of TV, video game or stereo he wants.\\
281 - Is there an electronics store near here?\\
282 - Tech Boys on Willow.\\
283 - Price Town's closer, but they have crap for high-def.\\
284 - I've got something for Hal that I think may do the trick.\\
285 - Abe, I thought we were done with this.\\
286 - I thought we were, too, Lois, until 3:00 this morning,\\
287 - when I found myself in a collectibles auction site and saw this baby.\\
288 - Yes, it's a Vulcan lyre with ten preprogrammed Christmas carols.\\
289 - Abe, I'm sorry. I know you're trying to help, but this is not what Hal needs.\\
290 - You're right.\\
291 - I guess I got carried away and lost sight of what got us started in the first place...\\
292 - to hook Hal up with a member of the original cast of Star Trek.\\
293 - That's not what got this started.\\
294 - Abe, Hal's father died.\\
295 - And I will not let him die in vain.\\
296 - I will call Sulu.\\
297 - I will call Chekhov.\\
298 - And if they say no, so help me,\\
299 - I will call the Gorn.\\
300 - Abe, stop, just stop.\\
301 - I appreciate your trying to help, but I don't need any of this.\\
302 - I'm going to take Hal to a bed and breakfast for a nice weekend, and that's it.\\
303 - He just needs some emotional comfort.\\
304 - So you think a weekend of nurturing and sex is going to get him through this?\\
305 - Do you even know this man?!\\
306 - What the hell's all this?\\
307 - Turns out Dad still has some grieving left to do.\\
308 - I can't believe you.\\
309 - You lied to me and you totally took advantage of him.\\
310 - I don't see it that way.\\
311 - They say money can't buy love...\\
312 - but they're wrong.\\
313 - I'm actually starting to love Dad.\\
314 - Now I'm not saying somebody couldn't come along and outbid him,\\
315 - but right now, he's the front-runner.\\
316 - You can't do this.\\
317 - This is wrong.\\
318 - You're giving all this back.\\
319 - Who are you to question his process?\\
320 - Reese, he's crazy.\\
321 - Mom's crazy.\\
322 - But she's the kind of crazy where all she does is yell at us and punish.\\
323 - Now Dad's crazy in a way where he buys us an XBox 360.\\
324 - And you want to mess with that?\\
325 - You're just afraid of happiness, Malcolm.\\
326 - You can delude yourself all you want.\\
327 - -All this is going back to the store. -Hey, give that back!\\
328 - -You had your chance! -Reese, this is over!\\
329 - This is the only good thing that's ever happened around here and you're ruining it!\\
330 - Boys! What are you doing?\\
331 - Today's a happy day.\\
332 - You're supposed to remember this the rest of your lives.\\
333 - I need to talk to you, Dad.\\
334 - Dad, if you love us, don't listen to him.\\
335 - Look at what you're doing.\\
336 - Look at the money you're spending.\\
337 - Look at the reason why you're spending it.\\
338 - Something is very wrong.\\
339 - I hear you, Malcolm.\\
340 - I understand that things have gotten a little unbalanced and,\\
341 - -and I know what I need to do. -Thank God.\\
342 - I'm going to buy you a car.\\
343 - It's moments like this that really define character.\\
344 - I love you, Daddy!\\
345 - No, it's not our honeymoon, but I would like the honeymoon suite.\\
346 - What?\\
347 - No, that must be a mistake.\\
348 - My credit card can't be maxed out. I just paid the bill.\\
349 - Reese!\\
350 - Get me out of this.\\
351 - Malcolm's getting a car.\\
352 - We only did this so Dad wouldn't buy us something more expensive.\\
353 - I miss Grandpa.\\
354 - I know this is wrong.\\
355 - But somehow my body's not doing anything to stop it.\\
356 - Maybe that means at some level, I don't even know it's wrong.\\
357 - And if I don't know if it's wrong, then I can't get blamed for doing it.\\
358 - Right?\\
359 - Now, a high-tech package comes with a CG rearview imaging system, a GPS and a DVD.\\
360 - I don't absolutely need a DVD player.\\
361 - Sure you do, Malcolm.\\
362 - Every time you stop at a red light, I want you watching movies, thinking of your dad.\\
363 - What else have we got?\\
364 - Want to sports package?\\
365 - That's like asking if we want doors.\\
366 - There it is, every option we offer, including some I didn't even know about.\\
367 - Floormats have undercoating.\\
368 - Comes with a 14-year warranty.\\
369 - We don't sell many of those.\\
370 - All it needs...\\
371 - is your signature.\\
372 - What?\\
373 - My dad had the same pen.\\
374 - He must've been a great guy. This is a great pen.\\
375 - We don't really need to get into that right now.\\
376 - See, I just lost my dad.\\
377 - I'm sorry.\\
378 - Bet he would've loved to see his grandson driving that sports pack.\\
379 - I don't know if he would have.\\
380 - He was pretty emotionally distant.\\
381 - He had a lot of trouble showing love.\\
382 - Yeah.\\
383 - Old-timers, eh?\\
384 - But I didn't care.\\
385 - I didn't care if he had trouble.\\
386 - I loved him.\\
387 - He was my dad.\\
388 - You know, I see that you're in a lot of pain right now, and...\\
389 - I'm going to need some grief counseling, too, if I let you take me up on this offer I'm giving you.\\
390 - I remember coming downstairs in the morning,\\
391 - and he would be at the table and he would say, "Hey, buddy,\\
392 - I'm doing four things at once:\\
393 - I'm watching TV.\\
394 - I'm reading the newspaper.\\
395 - I'm drinking coffee, and I'm talking to you."\\
396 - Isn't that amazing?\\
397 - You know, I got a guy whose wife died who's looking at this car, so...\\
398 - He didn't have to do anything for me.\\
399 - He was my dad.\\
400 - Dad...\\
401 - You don't have to do anything for me, either.\\
402 - But if you want to...\\
403 - that'd be great.\\
404 - I lost my dad.\\
405 - I know.\\
406 - You're a dead man.\\
407 - Hello?\\
408 - I'm George Takei.\\
409 - I played Sulu on Star Trek.\\
410 - Did your grandfather die recently?\\
411 - Yes.\\
412 - Allow me to extend my deepest condolences.\\
413 - I got a call from a neighbor that your father might like to talk to me.\\
414 - And when I called back, the line was busy. So I decided to come over.\\
415 - It was a six-hour bus ride with a lot of stops.\\
416 - May I have some water, please?\\
417 - Sorry, my parents aren't home.\\
418 - But you can use the hose out front.\\
419 - Delightful.\\
420 - If you don't mind, I'll make camp on your front lawn in anticipation of their return.\\
421 - Improvisation: my stock and trade.\\
422 - In episode 18, "The Squire of Gothos,"\\
423 - the script read, "the crew ad-libs hello."\\
424 - Well, I was off to the races.\\
425 - Well, I've got a lot of homework.\\
426 - Ooh, mushrooms!\\
427 - May I help myself?
\subsection {Episode 15: A.A.}
1 - Mom, Reese is poking me!\\
2 - That's it, you two.\\
3 - Either side of the couch, now!\\
4 - He's still poking me!\\
5 - Reese, go to your room!\\
6 - I don't want you within 30 feet of him!\\
7 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.15 - "A.A."\\

10 - Come on, Hal! We're going to be late.\\
11 - Fine, but I don't see what the big deal is.\\
12 - So what if he stopped drinking for a year?\\
13 - I thought that's what you're supposed to do in AA.\\
14 - Francis' one-year anniversary of sobriety is very important to him.\\
15 - Sounds to me like it was just dreamed up by the greeting card companies.\\
16 - What is wrong with you?\\
17 - Francis has joined AA, and is turning his life around.\\
18 - These are the people who helped him do that, and he wants us to meet them.\\
19 - Where were they when he needed to learn to ride a bicycle?\\
20 - Or when he lost his first tooth?\\
21 - We did all the heavy lifting.\\
22 - And now these guys get all the glory.\\
23 - I can't believe you're jealous of these people.\\
24 - Well, what does he need us for?\\
25 - He's got them now. We're useless.\\
26 - We're like his appendix.\\
27 - Now he's just going to open up his stomach,\\
28 - remove us, and put us in a jar up on a shelf,\\
29 - right there in the living room...\\
30 - or the...\\
31 - den, or...\\
32 - a mantlepiece, if he's got one.\\
33 - I'm gonna go wait in the car.\\
34 - Where's Jamie?\\
35 - There he is.\\
36 - He's been dying to go to that sitter's all morning.\\
37 - I swear that woman feeds him nothing but sugar all day long.\\
38 - I'm coming!\\
39 - Bye, Mom. Say hi to Francis.\\
40 - Oh, wait, wait, all right. You've got your food money.\\
41 - You've got your emergency numbers.\\
42 - We'll be home Sunday night around 9:00.\\
43 - But before I forget.\\
44 - This is the one thing left in this house that I care about.\\
45 - I don't want to spend the next two days worrying about\\
46 - "How will they break it, where will they hide the pieces,\\
47 - how will they lie to me about it when I come home."\\
48 - So...\\
49 - There. Now I can relax.\\
50 - I'm bored.\\
51 - Mom and Dad are gone. You want to make some crank calls?\\
52 - Nah.\\
53 - I guess I'm getting old. I'm really not inspired.\\
54 - We could cherry bomb Ms. Waller's mailbox.\\
55 - What's the point?\\
56 - She'd just chase me, have an asthma attack.\\
57 - The neighbors would call 911.\\
58 - I'd get away with it because of her blackout.\\
59 - We'd both just be going through the motions.\\
60 - You're right.\\
61 - Terrorizing the same old neighbors year after year just doesn't feel satisfying anymore.\\
62 - Maybe we're growing up.\\
63 - Maybe we don't need to go out and create random havoc.\\
64 - Hey, guys, I was digging around in the garage,\\
65 - and I found the spare key to Dad's car!\\
66 - Do you know what this means?\\
67 - We can key stuff!\\
68 - No, we have mobility.\\
69 - We can drive over to the next city.\\
70 - And key stuff there!\\
71 - And key stuff there, and cherry-bomb stuff there.\\
72 - Reese, we have access to a car with no adult supervision.\\
73 - We can do whatever we want, and if we get caught?\\
74 - They'd blame Mom and Dad for being absentee parents.\\
75 - -This is the perfect crime. -I was thinking we could drive to the arcade.\\
76 - Arcade?\\
77 - What are you, 12?\\
78 - Yeah.\\
79 - Dewey, get out of the way. Malcolm and I have to plan some pain.\\
80 - What about South High?\\
81 - I think their band practice starts in two hours.\\
82 - Perfect. I still have some connections at the slaughterhouse.\\
83 - One phone call, and I got a trunkful of pig's blood.\\
84 - It's humble, but it's home.\\
85 - Actually, they just walled off a bedroom from the apartment next door...\\
86 - but anyway, it's home.\\
87 - Uh, you know, Francis, your mother and I passed a motel on the way here...\\
88 - Nonsense. I won't have my parents staying at some motel.\\
89 - You can sleep here.\\
90 - -On the rug? -It's a futon.\\
91 - Believe it or not, someone was actually going to throw that away.\\
92 - You know, my back...\\
93 - Hal, let him do this.\\
94 - All righty, we'll stay.\\
95 - Great!\\
96 - You know, I'm really glad you guys came up here for my celebration.\\
97 - Speaking of which...\\
98 - -Piama! -It's fine.\\
99 - Really, Mom, I have a handle on it.\\
100 - Besides we're not just celebrating my sobriety.\\
101 - We're also celebrating my new job.\\
102 - Francis, that's wonderful!\\
103 - What is it?\\
104 - A laser-etched crystal.\\
105 - It's the perfect fusion of science and art.\\
106 - The detail is amazing.\\
107 - And you can see everything on this nude fairy.\\
108 - That's me.\\
109 - You can put whatever image you want in these crystals, but it all adds up to one thing:\\
110 - financial independence in five to twelve years.\\
111 - We're starting our own business.\\
112 - We already looked into the franchise and locked down the location.\\
113 - Now all we have to do is work out the financing.\\
114 - Oh?\\
115 - Don't worry, Mom, we don't need any money...\\
116 - we already got $10,000 from Piama's mom's lawsuit settlement.\\
117 - The newspaper used her picture without her permission for an article on mental defectives.\\
118 - All we need from you guys is to co-sign the loan.\\
119 - We hate to ask, but...\\
120 - you're the only people Piama and I could turn to for this.\\
121 - Did you hear that, honey?\\
122 - He's turning to us.\\
123 - -How much? -It's just a small business loan:\\
124 - $20,000.\\
125 - $20,000?!\\
126 - And none of your drunk friends could help you out on this, huh?\\
127 - Not at all. Oh, and don't worry, the bank already ran your credit.\\
128 - It's horrible, but all that means is they just crank up the interest rate.\\
129 - In what world would you think we would sign that?\\
130 - Honey, come here.\\
131 - Let's hear the boy out.\\
132 - You heard him; he needs us.\\
133 - Hal, I'm not going to sign anything. We're in enough debt as it is.\\
134 - Lois...\\
135 - I hate to do this, but can we talk about this later?\\
136 - We really got to get to my AA party.\\
137 - Of course!\\
138 - I got to tell you, son, I am drunk as a skunk with pride right now.\\
139 - Okay, we have 12 hours and eight gallons of gas.\\
140 - This is our radius of destruction.\\
141 - So much to do, so little time.\\
142 - What about my old 4th grade teacher?\\
143 - If we get Mr. Bradshaw, then we can't moon the girls' school.\\
144 - No, the mooning is a definite.\\
145 - For you to even suggest that makes me really question your commitment.\\
146 - If I give you Bradshaw, then I can't do donuts on the lawn of my old basketball coach.\\
147 - -What about the arcade? -Not now, Dewey.\\
148 - -All right, I'll give you the donuts. -Great.\\
149 - So which way are we leaning on the whole cat show situation?\\
150 - If you get me that coyote, then I'll get you to the cat show.\\
151 - The arcade is on the way to the cat show.\\
152 - Out!\\
153 - Hey, are we peeing in the mailbox on Fifth, or aren't we?\\
154 - I've already drank three of these. Do not embarrass me out there.\\
155 - Come on, Reese, we are so close.\\
156 - Do you really need five minutes to work over your old lab partner?\\
157 - Yeah.\\
158 - Why do something if you're not gonna do it right?\\
159 - All right, do you think you could work your boy over in the back seat of the car?\\
160 - What are you getting at?\\
161 - After we push over those gravestones,\\
162 - we can pick up the lab partner.\\
163 - By the time you're done with him, we're at the promenade,\\
164 - where we do our pedestrian-only drive through.\\
165 - Then it's a straight shot down 45th street, just in time for the old folks' health walk.\\
166 - A quick streak, and dude...\\
167 - we're done!\\
168 - -Yeah! -Ah!\\
169 - All right, we have to get going.\\
170 - We need the car key.\\
171 - Are we going to the arcade?\\
172 - We already told you we don't have time for that, Dewey.\\
173 - You know something?\\
174 - I don't remember where I put it.\\
175 - Stupid! How could you misplace it?!\\
176 - Wait a minute... he's lying.\\
177 - Dewey, give us the key now!\\
178 - Nope.\\
179 - All right, Dewey, we can either do this the easy...\\
180 - No fair.\\
181 - That's just what I was going to do.\\
182 - Crash!\\
183 - Frankie, my man!\\
184 - -Little Miss P. -Hey, baby.\\
185 - Crash, I'd like you to meet my dad.\\
186 - Hello.\\
187 - Stay strong, brother.\\
188 - Okay.\\
189 - And this is my mother.\\
190 - She's real?\\
191 - Excuse me?\\
192 - It's...\\
193 - I thought...\\
194 - I don't know what I thought.\\
195 - I'm sorry. Excuse me.\\
196 - What was that all about?\\
197 - Give it up, Dewey!\\
198 - No!\\
199 - -Tell us where the key is! -No!\\
200 - Tell us where the key is!\\
201 - No.\\
202 - -Give us the key. -No.\\
203 - That was our last worm!\\
204 - -It's no use; he's immune. -It's our own fault...\\
205 - we've been torturing him since Mom brought him home from the hospital.\\
206 - Remember when he was a baby?\\
207 - I could make him cry, just like that.\\
208 - Now we're stuck with this.\\
209 - We've all come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\\
210 - None of us could have gotten to where we are today if it wasn't for everyone here.\\
211 - But there is one man that I would especially like to thank.\\
212 - Francis!\\
213 - Francis...\\
214 - Your honesty has really helped me through this.\\
215 - I went through life feeling pretty sorry for myself.\\
216 - Thinking that I was brutalized and abused,\\
217 - but then I heard your horror stories\\
218 - and I realized that my junkie abusive mom wasn't that bad at all.\\
219 - Oh, sure, she beat me,\\
220 - she left me in that dumpster, and all but...\\
221 - she was a saint compared to "L."\\
222 - I don't know how you survived it, man, but I thank God you did.\\
223 - "L"?!\\
224 - Hal, can you believe this?\\
225 - They are so open here.\\
226 - It's just so raw!\\
227 - It's beautiful.\\
228 - Let's be fair.\\
229 - We all have an "L" in our lives.\\
230 - My "L" was the Vietnam War.\\
231 - Thankfully, though, I don't have to visit my "L" on Christmas and holidays.\\
232 - I can leave my "L" buried deep in the darkest recesses of my mind.\\
233 - And I thank God for that.\\
234 - Stay strong, Francis.\\
235 - And now, let's hear from the man of the hour.\\
236 - Our very own Francis.\\
237 - Thanks, George.\\
238 - Thank you all.\\
239 - A lot of horrible things have been said tonight,\\
240 - and I appreciate your honesty,\\
241 - but that's in the past.\\
242 - We need to clean the slate and start over, and to do that,\\
243 - we need to make amends to the people we have wronged.\\
244 - To my beautiful wife, Piama...\\
245 - for all the terrible things I put you through...\\
246 - I'm sorry.\\
247 - And to my brothers, who aren't here right now...\\
248 - for all the times I couldn't be there for you 'cause I was in my own...\\
249 - messed-up place...\\
250 - I'm sorry.\\
251 - To my father...\\
252 - I put you through so much,\\
253 - yet you were always there for me.\\
254 - I'm sorry.\\
255 - And to my mother, L...\\
256 - I forgive you.\\
257 - You forgive me?!\\
258 - Okay, it's a bit extreme, but Dewey has left us no choice.\\
259 - Since he's withstood our most horrible tortures,\\
260 - Reese and I have to do something that goes against everything we believe in this house.\\
261 - How thin do you want the ham?\\
262 - Same as the last sandwich.\\
263 - How's the milkshake?\\
264 - Mm, quite nice.\\
265 - You'll notice there's no snot, spit or pee in there.\\
266 - I thought it tasted different.\\
267 - And the massage is amazing.\\
268 - You got tension out of my shoulder I didn't even know was there till it was gone.\\
269 - I feel eight!\\
270 - Can we get you anything else?\\
271 - Well, there is one thing...\\
272 - Nah.\\
273 - No, what is it?\\
274 - It's a little childish.\\
275 - Nonsense, Dewey. Come on, this is your day.\\
276 - I would really love a piggy-back ride around the neighborhood.\\
277 - I'll get my shoes.\\
278 - Guys, this is fantastic.\\
279 - I really think we've healed a lot of wounds today.\\
280 - Really? That's great, Dewey.\\
281 - You know, I was thinking, you're full...\\
282 - you're relaxed, you're watching your favorite TV show...\\
283 - Do you think we could have that, uh, car key now?\\
284 - You know something?\\
285 - You guys have earned it.\\
286 - You really have.\\
287 - And I wish I could give it to you.\\
288 - -What do you mean? -You guys threw me a curve ball.\\
289 - I had no idea it was going to go this way.\\
290 - Bravo.\\
291 - But I swallowed it.\\
292 - What?\\
293 - I know. It was foolish and spiteful, but...\\
294 - this was before we reconnected.\\
295 - Hey, is there any more of this shake left?\\
296 - Unbelievable!\\
297 - You invite me up here for a celebration, and instead, you blindside me?!\\
298 - You told complete strangers that I'm a monster!\\
299 - Mom, I acknowledge your anger.\\
300 - Well, get ready to acknowledge a lot more!\\
301 - Oh, you "forgive me," Francis?\\
302 - Do you forgive me for 27 hours of labor?!\\
303 - For staying up all night with you when you were sick with 105-degree temperature?!\\
304 - For the thousands of hours I spent trying to get you to do your homework?!\\
305 - Yes, Mom, I forgive you.\\
306 - So it's all my fault that your life is messed up and you're an alcoholic?!\\
307 - I'm the source of everything wrong with your life?!\\
308 - Mom, I'd love to get into this, but we don't talk about these things outside the meeting.\\
309 - Well, get your coat. We're going back.\\
310 - Uh, Lois, let's not ruin Francis' special day.\\
311 - Why not? Apparently, I've ruined everything else!\\
312 - What's past is past.\\
313 - "What's past is past"?!\\
314 - So you think this is all my fault, too?!\\
315 - Can we discuss this in the other room?\\
316 - There is no other room!\\
317 - Just admit it, guys: You've been beat.\\
318 - Are you kidding?\\
319 - Now that we know where the key is, it's only a matter of time.\\
320 - Here's Grandma's special cereal.\\
321 - That stuff is so powerful, she had to eat it in the bathroom.\\
322 - The recoil is going to put you through the ceiling, little man.\\
323 - I don't know why we're going through all this trouble. I had a much faster way to do this.\\
324 - We're not cutting him open, Reese.\\
325 - This will still work out.\\
326 - We just have to adjust the destruction list.\\
327 - The way I look at it,\\
328 - we have to skip paint ballooning the Tai-chi group,\\
329 - the charity 10K won't get its phony route markers,\\
330 - and I'm afraid planting the porn magazines in the feminist bookstore will have to wait till another time.\\
331 - It's like you're killing my children!\\
332 - -Wait. Wait... -Shut up, Dewey!\\
333 - That's not the end I want to be hearing from!\\
334 - You're taking his side in this?!\\
335 - I'm not taking anyone's side.\\
336 - There are no sides!\\
337 - I'm just saying look at it from Francis' side.\\
338 - He crucified me in that meeting!\\
339 - You're right to feel attacked by these people, but this is about Francis.\\
340 - He's building a new life.\\
341 - We've got to go easy on him.\\
342 - He's only been sober for one year.\\
343 - He's a one-year-old. You're fighting with an infant!\\
344 - That infant dragged my name through the mud and now wants us to give him $20,000!\\
345 - This is an investment in a business for our son.\\
346 - What?! He's quit drinking, and now magically, he knows how to run a business?!\\
347 - See? You are still stuck in this stupid death struggle,\\
348 - that you have had with him since he was born!\\
349 - Francis has changed, and you have got to face that fact!\\
350 - No! Francis has not changed!\\
351 - He has just changed his tricks to get what he wants.\\
352 - This whole day has been about getting us to sign that loan!\\
353 - There you go again!\\
354 - I know for a fact this is not about the loan!\\
355 - -How? How do you know that? -Because I've already signed it, okay?!\\
356 - So can we just move on?!\\
357 - What?!\\
358 - -Nothing yet. -I wish there was something I could do.\\
359 - -I feel so helpless. -Just think good thoughts.\\
360 - Reese, quick, the colander!\\
361 - Where do we start?\\
362 - I guess you just...\\
363 - go for it.\\
364 - Dewey!\\
365 - -He had the key all along! -No!\\
366 - That little...\\
367 - What are you doing?\\
368 - There could be a spare.\\
369 - I cannot believe you went behind my back on this!\\
370 - If you think you're going to get away with this, you are sadly mistaken!\\
371 - $20,000, Francis?!\\
372 - How in the world would you...\\
373 - -What's this? -The loan.\\
374 - If you're not on board, we won't do it.\\
375 - What?\\
376 - I don't want you and Dad fighting because of us.\\
377 - This is not how we wanted to start our business.\\
378 - Piama and I will just get the money from someone else.\\
379 - But I was...\\
380 - -Really? -Absolutely.\\
381 - Come on. Let's go get something to eat.\\
382 - Oh, that new Thai place just opened up around the corner.\\
383 - Sounds good to me.\\
384 - Dad, you better get your jacket. It might get cold.\\
385 - Okay.\\
386 - Francis?\\
387 - Yeah, Mom?\\
388 - Are you sure you don't want the money?\\
389 - Mom, I don't want anything you don't want to give.\\
390 - -Mom... -I want you to have the loan.\\
391 - I was wrong.\\
392 - You've changed.\\
393 - Are you serious?\\
394 - -Really, you don't have to do this. -Oh, I know.\\
395 - That's why I want you to have it.\\
396 - So that you and Piama can start your business with our blessing.\\
397 - Wow, Mom, this is huge!\\
398 - -Well, it is a lot of money. -Not the loan...you.\\
399 - -What? -You actually admitted you were wrong.\\
400 - That's the first step.\\
401 - Are you ready to take the next one?\\
402 - What are you talking about? What step?\\
403 - The first step to admitting you're an alcoholic.\\
404 - I'm not an alcoholic.\\
405 - Okay, you're not ready.\\
406 - This is my fault. They tell us not to do this. It...\\
407 - has to come from you. Is everybody ready to go?\\
408 - Francis, I don't drink.\\
409 - I mean, maybe I have a glass of champagne on my birthday...\\
410 - -Every birthday? -What does that have to do with anything?\\
411 - -I think we should get going... -Come on, Mom, you have the classic signs.\\
412 - Irrational behavior, not able to control your emotions.\\
413 - Everybody else is the problem.\\
414 - Francis, I do not drink.\\
415 - I am not an alcoholic.\\
416 - Mom, you don't have to drink to be an alcoholic.\\
417 - Yeah, you do!\\
418 - Alcoholism.\\
419 - It's in the name.\\
420 - I think your mother's right on this.\\
421 - No, she's not.\\
422 - I barely drank, and I'm an alcoholic.\\
423 - It's true; I've only seen him tipsy once.\\
424 - He gets sick. I can't even give him cough syrup.\\
425 - How the hell can you call yourself an alcoholic if you don't even drink?!\\
426 - What do you mean?! My life was a wreck!\\
427 - I had no future, no hope.\\
428 - -I had all the signs. -Except for the alcohol part.\\
429 - Why do you keep harping on that?!\\
430 - Why do you have to do that?!\\
431 - You never let me have anything!\\
432 - You wouldn't let me have that bike or those throwing stars!\\
433 - Now you won't let me have alcoholism...\\
434 - the one thing I'm doing right in my life!\\
435 - Unbelievable.\\
436 - If it's not me, it's alcohol, right?\\
437 - The problem's always somewhere else.\\
438 - Francis, you need to take a look in the mirror.\\
439 - Come on, Hal, let's go home.\\
440 - Wait a minute.\\
441 - You can't walk out on me!\\
442 - This is your problem, too!\\
443 - At least you support me, right, Dad?\\
444 - You know, I thought I did, son, but then I realized I was just doing it for all the wrong reasons.\\
445 - I was just trying to buy your love.\\
446 - See you on your real birthday, son.\\
447 - You know, maybe Mom was right.\\
448 - I was blaming her and the alcohol for my problems...\\
449 - when the real problem was always right in front of me...\\
450 - Me?!\\
451 - Yes, you.\\
452 - Who else could it be?\\
453 - Why didn't you tell me I wasn't an alcoholic?!\\
454 - How am I supposed to know?! You seemed messed up to me.\\
455 - You made me look like an idiot!\\
456 - -That wasn't hard to do. -Was that an insult?!
\subsection {Episode 16: Lois Strikes Back}
1 - Reese, I just bought that for you. Will you look at...\\
2 - Give it to me.\\
3 - Let me see what I can do with it.\\
4 - I sneezed in chem lab and spilled acid on it.\\
5 - I'm not wearing these stupid shorts anymore.\\
6 - Everyone's making fun of me.\\
7 - A denim tie.\\
8 - How cool is that?\\

12 - No way!\\
13 - No way! That's awesome.\\
14 - Okay. I can't wait to see you.\\
15 - No, I can't wait to see you more.\\
16 - No, I can't wait to see you more.\\
17 - Okay, you win.\\
18 - All right, Cindy's only a few blocks away, so everybody calm down.\\
19 - When she gets here, just try to be cool. I want to make a good impression.\\
20 - Do I have a bat in the hanger?\\
21 - You've asked me five times. The answer's still yes.\\
22 - So, this is pretty exciting, Reese.\\
23 - When did you meet this girl?\\
24 - I haven't actually met her.\\
25 - Her cousin goes to school with me,\\
26 - and Cindy saw me at the dance last week and thought I was hot.\\
27 - Oh, well, I don't blame her.\\
28 - I mean, forgetting I'm your mother for a minute,\\
29 - if I saw you walking down the street, I would think, there is one hot guy.\\
30 - Yeesh.\\
31 - Cindy and I talked on the phone almost every night last week,\\
32 - and we totally have the same sense of humor.\\
33 - She said she saw me put the plastic dog poop in the punch bowl at the school dance,\\
34 - and we both agreed that the real stuff would have been funnier.\\
35 - You put plastic poop in the punch bowl?!\\
36 - Once again, you completely miss the point.\\
37 - So, what kind of loser would want to go out with you?\\
38 - This kind of loser.\\
39 - And if she kisses half as good as her picture does, this is going to be sweet.\\
40 - Okay, there she is. Everybody, get out of here.\\
41 - No, wait.\\
42 - She'll probably want to meet you.\\
43 - Okay, you can stay, just don't say anything stupid.\\
44 - How's my hair?\\
45 - Can you smell my pits?\\
46 - Why'd you let me put on this stupid shirt?\\
47 - Reese, relax. All you have to do is just be yourself.\\
48 - You're right, Mom.\\
49 - Thanks.\\
50 - Enjoy your date, Reese!\\
51 - And the pig was actually wearing lipstick?\\
52 - Reese was devastated.\\
53 - I can just imagine.\\
54 - And-And I don't like it.\\
55 - No, no, no, not one little bit.\\
56 - Now, uh, what is it that you want me to do?\\
57 - Look, I know that Reese has not been a model student,\\
58 - and once again, I want to apologize for your tires.\\
59 - And your mailbox.\\
60 - And your lawn fountain.\\
61 - But what those girls did is just cruel, and I need to see them punished.\\
62 - All right, you let me see what I can find out.\\
63 - Now, these girls are obviously quite clever.\\
64 - I mean, where do you even... find a pig?\\
65 - And then we have to get it over to your house, and put makeup on it.\\
66 - Reese was completely blindsided, huh?\\
67 - You know what?\\
68 - I have had it.\\
69 - How would you like it if I called the Superintendent and told him all about this?\\
70 - Great. I'll put him on the speaker phone.\\
71 - REESE & CINDY For King and Queen\\
72 - Unbelievable.\\
73 - I've never witnessed anything like that in my entire life.\\
74 - There's no excuse for it.\\
75 - How did an immature jerk like that get to be Principal of a high school, Hal? How?\\
76 - -Well, with what they... -He actually laughed.\\
77 - He couldn't care less that our son is curled up on his bed and completely devastated by this.\\
78 - Honey, I think you actually got chunks of cutting board in the salad.\\
79 - -Well, I happen to be very upset, Hal. -I'm upset, too. And this...\\
80 - Principal sounds like a real idiot, but,\\
81 - you've talked to him, and if he's not going to do anything about it, I don't see what else we can do.\\
82 - Well, you know what, Hal?\\
83 - That's just unacceptable to me.\\
84 - It's just the way it is.\\
85 - Kids do cruel things to each other.\\
86 - But, you know, they bounce back when you're young.\\
87 - And I actually think that Reese is coming around a little bit.\\
88 - Well, I brought him soup yesterday, and he couldn't even make a sound.\\
89 - Now, I really...\\
90 - I really think thing's are going to turn out okay.\\
91 - Are you trying to calm me down?\\
92 - No.\\
93 - I just don't think it leads anywhere good when you get like this.\\
94 - Get like what?\\
95 - Well...\\
96 - you know.\\
97 - No, I don't know.\\
98 - How is it I get?\\
99 - Well...\\
100 - If I have a problem,\\
101 - I would love for you to explain it to me.\\
102 - You know what, honey? This seems like a-a longer conversation,\\
103 - and it just so happens that I am right in the middle of a project in the garage.\\
104 - I'm fixing that drawer from our bathroom cabinet.\\
105 - You know how you've always had to keep your makeup brushes in the pockets of your robe?\\
106 - Well, I finally got around to it, and wouldn't you know,\\
107 - it's time for that second gluing.\\
108 - But if you let it dry too much,\\
109 - you might as well make a bird's nest out of it.\\
110 - But then I'd have to sand it and paint it, and that's a whole different magilla.\\
111 - But when I'm done, we will roll up our sleeves, and we will get through this.\\
112 - I mean, if you have to vent, go ahead.\\
113 - I am your sounding board.\\
114 - I don't care if you have to bite my head off.\\
115 - It's okay, it's what I'm here for.\\
116 - I am your rock.\\
117 - You've always been there for me, and I'll be there for you,\\
118 - even though physically, I may be in the garage, and you in the kitchen.\\
119 - No matter where I am, I'm there.\\
120 - I want names.\\
121 - How many were there?\\
122 - Good. At least you can hear me now.\\
123 - Just nod when you see one.\\
124 - Kristin?\\
125 - It's okay.\\
126 - She can't hurt you now.\\
127 - You just love that beautiful hair.\\
128 - Don't you, sweetie?\\
129 - Damn this drawer!\\
130 - What do you want from me?!\\
131 - And you can kiss that baby good-bye.\\
132 - Another walk off home run for Hal, and the crowd is on its feet.\\
133 - Hal! Hal!\\
134 - I can't take this anymore, Reese.\\
135 - You have to stop this and get on with your life.\\
136 - Did I remind you of your life?\\
137 - Look, Reese.\\
138 - It's my ant farm. I've been raising them for months.\\
139 - I know all their names and love each and every one of them.\\
140 - Here, have fun.\\
141 - Why does everything I love always turn into a pig?\\
142 - Hey, I've got it.\\
143 - You'll love this.\\
144 - Today at lunch, Rick Jensen sat in beef stew.\\
145 - And then spilled lemonade on his crotch.\\
146 - It was a perfect storm.\\
147 - Kids were coming from other schools to laugh at him.\\
148 - Was he able to get his pants clean?\\
149 - Come on, Reese.\\
150 - You should get back to bed.\\
151 - I'll bet his mom wasn't able to get his pants clean.\\
152 - Hi, Malcolm. How was school?\\
153 - Okay, I guess.\\
154 - Well, there was this one weird thing.\\
155 - This girl named Kristin, she's one of the girls that picked on Reese.\\
156 - You're not going to believe what happened to her.\\
157 - Oh, my God!\\
158 - Oh, my God! Oh!\\
159 - My hair! Oh, my God.\\
160 - Oh, my God!\\
161 - Who did this?!\\
162 - Who did this?!\\
163 - They tried to get it all out, but I heard the janitor ended up having to cut off all her hair with a hedge trimmer.\\
164 - Really?\\
165 - That's terrible.\\
166 - People can be so cruel.\\
167 - Oh, absolutely.\\
168 - Ugh! I know, exactly.\\
169 - You know, Kristin could not stop sobbing.\\
170 - I'm even earing now, she's a complete wreck.\\
171 - I know. Did you see her without her hair?\\
172 - You know, I never realized she had such a tiny head.\\
173 - Oh, but you know what the best part is?\\
174 - Now Dylan's available.\\
175 - Does he?\\
176 - No. Get out!\\
177 - Okay, rookie...\\
178 - Show me what you got.\\
179 - Okay...\\
180 - At least we know you're not on steroids.\\
181 - Mom, what are you doing here?\\
182 - I'm here to pick up some things for Reese.\\
183 - You know, so he can catch up on his school work.\\
184 - I hope you rented a truck.\\
185 - You know what?\\
186 - Everyone seems very amused by your brother's pain.\\
187 - Well, I think people better start thinking twice.\\
188 - Oh, my God!\\
189 - Who did this?\\
190 - Moppet?!\\
191 - Baby?!\\
192 - No!\\
193 - It's you!\\
194 - There you are.\\
195 - You took off so fast from school, we didn't get a chance to talk about what happened to Diane.\\
196 - I'm a very busy woman, Malcolm.\\
197 - It isn't easy running this household.\\
198 - I can imagine... cooking, shopping, cutting the heads off of dolls.\\
199 - I have no idea what you're talking about.\\
200 - Come on, Mom, it's pretty obvious what's going on here, and I think it's sick!\\
201 - Did you see Diane's reaction?\\
202 - No, I didn't...\\
203 - Was she crying?\\
204 - She had to be wrapped in a blanket and carried to the school nurse's office.\\
205 - Terrible, just terrible.\\
206 - There's a salad in the fridge and you boys can make yourselves sloppy Joe's whenever you're hungry.\\
207 - I've got some errands to run.\\
208 - Oh, "errands," right?\\
209 - I know what you're up to, Mom.\\
210 - Oh, yes, Malcolm, you've caught me.\\
211 - I've got to return an overdue video, go to the cleaners, and pick up milk and cereal for the morning.\\
212 - Guilty as charged.\\
213 - Oh, nice try.\\
214 - Now, I want you to look me in the eye and...\\
215 - Mom, I know you're behind all this, and sooner or later you're going to have to talk to me.\\
216 - For God's sake, Malcolm, can't I have a moment's rest?\\
217 - No, you can't!\\
218 - Tell me, did it feel good to cut through Elmo's neck?\\
219 - Did it?!\\
220 - Mom?\\
221 - Mom?\\
222 - Runners on second and third, with two out.\\
223 - Here's the wind-up, and the pitch.\\
224 - You know, it's a shame to see some of these veterans hang on a little too long.\\
225 - Oh, sure, they were great once,\\
226 - but there comes a point when you just have to say "I'm done," and hang them up.\\
227 - Dad, you've got to do something.\\
228 - Mom has been stalking those girls who humiliated Reese like some kind of vigilante.\\
229 - What? Are you sure about this?\\
230 - Yes. She's nailed two of them so far,\\
231 - and she just climbed out of the bathroom window to go get the third.\\
232 - This sounds like a lot of supposition, Malcolm.\\
233 - I mean, it would be a different story if you had hard evidence or an eyewitness.\\
234 - I saw her at school today.\\
235 - She was there when these butchered dolls' heads rolled out of one of the girls' lockers.\\
236 - And what exactly do you mean when you say you were "there"?\\
237 - Dad, stop it--don't you care?\\
238 - Of course, I care, But I think what we need right now is caution and prudence.\\
239 - A proactive wait-and-see... if you will.\\
240 - So you're not going to do anything?\\
241 - Listen, when your mother gets like this,\\
242 - we need to vigilantly keep abreast of all the developments\\
243 - in a fully-engaged yet cautiously-detached...\\
244 - Oh, forget it... if you're not going to help me,\\
245 - then I'll just stop her myself, and you can stay here and play your ridiculous little game.\\
246 - Good.\\
247 - Sorry about the delay, folks.\\
248 - There was a fan on the field.\\
249 - Now let's see if this bonus baby is really worth all the money that they paid for him.\\
250 - My God, that could've killed...\\
251 - You wouldn't believe the homework Mr. Hendricks has been dumping on us lately.\\
252 - Lift your arm.\\
253 - I mean, okay, your wife moved out.\\
254 - Don't take it out on us.\\
255 - If his behavior with her is anything like it is in math class, I totally get it.\\
256 - Hey, how is he doing?\\
257 - He's having a very good day.\\
258 - Hello?\\
259 - Hello.\\
260 - This is the Edgewood Hotel.\\
261 - I'm calling to verify a room with a queen-sized bed for tonight.\\
262 - I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.\\
263 - Oh?\\
264 - The reservation was made by Heidi Kaczenski.\\
265 - She also requested a bottle of champagne and the romance package.\\
266 - I think you'd better cancel that reservation.\\
267 - Heidi! Get in here this minute!\\
268 - Dad, what is so important? I...\\
269 - You and Scott got a hotel room for tonight?!\\
270 - What?!\\
271 - That was the hotel calling.\\
272 - How could you do this to us?!\\
273 - I didn't do anything. I was in my room getting ready for the dance.\\
274 - You really don't know anything about this?\\
275 - No!\\
276 - What's this?\\
277 - Oh, my God!\\
278 - That is not mine!\\
279 - I don't know what the hell you were thinking,\\
280 - but as of right now, you and Scott are through!\\
281 - I hate you! I hate both of you!\\
282 - I saw something move.\\
283 - There's somebody out there.\\
284 - What's going on out here?\\
285 - I'll tell you what's going on.\\
286 - I saw this punk peeking in your window.\\
287 - What?!\\
288 - I can't believe this!\\
289 - Jordan, I thought you were a good kid!\\
290 - But I was just...\\
291 - You picked the wrong night to mess with me, you little perv!\\
292 - Well, let's see what the police have to say about this.\\
293 - I need to talk to you.\\
294 - Not now.\\
295 - Please, I need to tell you something.\\
296 - I've been a terrible mother.\\
297 - It's okay, Mom.\\
298 - I've known that for a long time.\\
299 - No, you don't understand.\\
300 - When those girls humiliated you...\\
301 - Instead of trying to comfort you and help you deal with your feelings,\\
302 - I just got caught up in my own anger and went on a rampage.\\
303 - What?\\
304 - All I was worried about was making them pay, and they did.\\
305 - But what disturbs me is...\\
306 - how much I enjoyed crushing those three girls and watching them suffer.\\
307 - I tapped into some dark, ugly place inside of me.\\
308 - I was acting like...\\
309 - ...you.\\
310 - Oh, God, who am I kidding? I wasn't acting like you.\\
311 - I am you.\\
312 - There's this horrible thing that's part of us that makes it seem okay to do really scary stuff.\\
313 - I must have gotten it from Grandma, and I passed it on to you, sweetie.\\
314 - And all I can say is...\\
315 - I'm sorry.\\
316 - I'm deeply, deeply sorry.\\
317 - There's one left?\\
318 - No, Reese...\\
319 - That doesn't matter.\\
320 - Yeah, yeah, I know that, Mom.\\
321 - I'm just trying to let it sink in.\\
322 - You know, that girl will be getting away with it.\\
323 - She doesn't matter.\\
324 - What matters is us.\\
325 - I get that stuff about us, Mom.\\
326 - That was amazing.\\
327 - I was just thinking about what must be going through her head.\\
328 - But you're right, it's not about her.\\
329 - Exactly.\\
330 - What do you mean what's going on inside of her head?\\
331 - You know, how she thinks she beat you.\\
332 - "I'm perfect, and I got away with it, and that tired, frumpy housewife\\
333 - just didn't have what it took to finish the job."\\
334 - If you think you're manipulating me, you're wrong.\\
335 - That girl just needs to know she can't go around hurting people without there being consequences.\\
336 - And that way, she'll grow up to be a very nice young lady.\\
337 - Got it.\\
338 - And I want to make it clear that this is a one time thing, due to very special circumstances.\\
339 - Understood.\\
340 - Now get back there and fill up those balloons with paint.\\
341 - And I'll tell you what, Joe.\\
342 - The idea that man came from an ape still rankles me.\\
343 - I say prove it.\\
344 - Point well taken, Skip,\\
345 - but the good news here at the ballpark is that the rain delay is finally over, and we can get back to playing America's...\\
346 - I think we have enough.\\
347 - Let's move.\\
348 - I knew I'd find you here!\\
349 - Well, congratulations, Columbo.\\
350 - Now, move, we're in a hurry.\\
351 - Mom, no!\\
352 - What you're doing is crazy.\\
353 - It goes against everything you've ever taught us.\\
354 - You don't get it, Malcolm.\\
355 - This is a one time thing, due to very special circumstances.\\
356 - Tell him, Mom.\\
357 - Get out of our way!\\
358 - This is not going to happen.\\
359 - They're moving.\\
360 - -Adjust left. -Adjusting left.\\
361 - Direct hit.\\
362 - Oh, my God!\\
363 - Stop it!\\
364 - Make them stop!\\
365 - Let go of me you coward?\\
366 - Stop it!\\
367 - This is nice.\\
368 - Just the two of us.\\
369 - I was just thinking the same thing.\\
370 - Stop it!\\
371 - Stop!\\
372 - It's a shame it was over so quickly.\\
373 - I know.\\
374 - Maybe we can go bowling together some time.\\
375 - I'd like that.\\
376 - Unbelievable.\\
377 - So as long as you can rationalize your behavior,\\
378 - I guess you can do whatever you want.\\
379 - There are no rules, huh, Mom? Is that what you're saying?\\
380 - Oh, Malcolm, for Pete's sake. Don't be so upset.\\
381 - I'll do something with you next week.

26 - You lose a weekend, but you save 73 cents a batch.\\
27 - I'll bet a buck.\\
28 - -I'm out. -Fold.\\
29 - Me, too.\\
30 - Damn, you could see through these glasses, can't you?\\
31 - Oh! Oh, my tooth!\\
32 - Please, let the dentist take a look.\\
33 - It's this one.\\
34 - Uh-oh, #31 is cracked.\\
35 - -Is that important? -Only for eating and talking.\\
36 - It's one of the glory boys.\\
37 - You better get that fixed.\\
38 - Great.\\
39 - My company doesn't have a dental plan anymore.\\
40 - They got us a foosball table instead.\\
41 - So where you been going?\\
42 - The dental college. It's not too bad,\\
43 - but they do make you sign a death waiver.\\
44 - Forget about that.\\
45 - Come by my office on Monday, and I'll take care of it.\\
46 - -Really? -Absolutely.\\
47 - Wow, it's been so many years since I've been to a real dentist.\\
48 - Do you supply the ether rag, or should I bring my own?\\
49 - God, I'm so bored.\\
50 - Everything's boring.\\
51 - It makes ditching school almost seem like a bad choice.\\
52 - Even talking about boring is getting boring.\\
53 - Yeah, boring.\\
54 - Bored, bored, bored, bored...\\
55 - -Wait! You see that? -What?\\
56 - It's a dead squirrel!\\
57 - Gentlemen, our week just filled up.\\
58 - Sorry, not interested.\\
59 - Sure, it looks good to you now,\\
60 - but it's just going to wind up in the closet with all the others.\\
61 - Pass.\\
62 - Your loss.\\
63 - See you, suckers.\\
64 - Mom?\\
65 - Why aren't you in school?!\\
66 - You're in trouble, young man!\\
67 - Oh, I don't think so.\\
68 - You're in the middle of an alley trying to get on a bike.\\
69 - You are ashamed of something.\\
70 - I can always smell shame.\\
71 - It's kind of like rotten coconut.\\
72 - Okay.\\
73 - There's this stupid bike-a-thon at work.\\
74 - Some idiot made a big stink about how the store's not doing enough for charity.\\
75 - -Then don't do it. -I have to.\\
76 - I'm the idiot.\\
77 - And I... I...\\
78 - I can't ride a bike...\\
79 - And it's very embarrassing.\\
80 - So you really can't ride a bike?\\
81 - No.\\
82 - Hey, everybody! My mom can't...\\
83 - You don't understand!\\
84 - My father didn't believe in training wheels!\\
85 - Mom!\\
86 - He just tied me to the bike and pushed me down the hill.\\
87 - Mom, there's glass down here!\\
88 - I came back with three teeth in my hand, and he just pushed me down all over again.\\
89 - After that, I just told people I knew how to ride.\\
90 - And I've been living with this lie ever since!\\
91 - Mom!\\
92 - If you tell anybody, I will kill you!\\
93 - -Do you hear me? -I won't tell a soul!\\
94 - -Let me up, and I can help! -What?!\\
95 - I know how to ride a bike! I'll teach you!\\
96 - You'd really do that?\\
97 - Absolutely. And you don't have to be embarrassed.\\
98 - No one will ever find out your horrible secret.\\
99 - No, lady, I don't want your drugs!\\
100 - Wow, and I thought Reese was the one dragging us down.\\
101 - Maybe we should see how he's doing with his squirrel.\\
102 - If I know Reese, all the good parts are gone by now.\\
103 - Nothing exciting ever happens around here.\\
104 - Wow...\\
105 - we even have boring miracles.\\
106 - It must have fallen from a plane or something.\\
107 - Wow, this is brand-new.\\
108 - At least what I think a mattress would look like new.\\
109 - -It's got no lumps. -No weird stains.\\
110 - No springs sticking out of it.\\
111 - -It's got tags! -It's got tags!\\
112 - It's like sitting on a cloud...\\
113 - with two clouds under it.\\
114 - This is amazing.\\
115 - I'm in ass heaven.\\
116 - Maybe it's worth some money.\\
117 - Sell it or keep it?\\
118 - Let's think about this for a second.\\
119 - Oh, my God, we totally fell asleep.\\
120 - That wasn't sleep.\\
121 - Sleep makes you feel like you've been beaten up.\\
122 - We got to keep this thing.\\
123 - Enjoying Lord of the Rings in high-def?\\
124 - Oh, it's unbelievable.\\
125 - No lines, no commercials...\\
126 - I'm bringing Lois here for our anniversary.\\
127 - I still can't get over all this.\\
128 - A real sink to spit in.\\
129 - I really don't have to swallow it.\\
130 - Hal, are you crying?\\
131 - They're good tears.\\
132 - How much longer will it take?\\
133 - I'm done.\\
134 - You can't be.\\
135 - I didn't bite down on the pain stick.\\
136 - No, it's done; I finally got the temporary crown on.\\
137 - I got to tell you, Hal, it was in pretty bad shape,\\
138 - but I think you're going to be happy with the results.\\
139 - Wow, you really are a friend.\\
140 - Two thousand dollars?!\\
141 - Excuse me, but this can't be right.\\
142 - Trey said he would take care of it.\\
143 - The doctor handed me the bill himself.\\
144 - You don't understand.\\
145 - I'm a friend of Trey's.\\
146 - And he gave you the friend discount: ten percent.\\
147 - You mean he was going to charge me more?!\\
148 - Can I have the key to the bathroom?\\
149 - Careful, it'll cost you $200 in a bathroom fee!\\
150 - You know what?\\
151 - You can tell Trey that this is what I think of his bill.\\
152 - -That was your parking validation. -I know.\\
153 - Could I have another one?\\
154 - Morning.\\
155 - Morning.\\
156 - -Last night was... -Fantastic.\\
157 - I'm glad we got these 600-thread-count sheets.\\
158 - Anything else would have been an insult to this beautiful mattress.\\
159 - We really have been living like beasts.\\
160 - A good night's sleep.\\
161 - Just think what we can do with all this new energy.\\
162 - Yeah.\\
163 - -Five more minutes? -I'm right behind you, buddy.\\
164 - -See? Just do that. -I can't.\\
165 - -You want me to show you again? -No, Reese.\\
166 - I'm afraid.\\
167 - So you're chicken, huh?\\
168 - Yes!\\
169 - Oh.\\
170 - Mom, you might not know this, but I used to be afraid of a lot of things.\\
171 - Thunder, frogs, mailboxes...\\
172 - You were afraid of mailboxes?\\
173 - I used to imagine that if I stuck my hand in a mailbox, it would slam shut and rip my hand off,\\
174 - but I simply conquered my fear by ripping the lid off of every mailbox in the neighborhood.\\
175 - I turned that fear into hate.\\
176 - And you have to hate that bike just as much.\\
177 - -I don't have hate. -You've got hate in there.\\
178 - You just have to find it.\\
179 - Do you hate work?\\
180 - Surprisingly, no.\\
181 - What about your life?\\
182 - Your best years are gone, and they weren't so good.\\
183 - I don't hate my life, Reese.\\
184 - What about the stuff I've done to you,\\
185 - like when I baked your shoes,\\
186 - or broke your wedding china,\\
187 - or when I sold those tickets to those fifth graders to watch you shower?\\
188 - You did what?!\\
189 - Perfect! Now direct that anger to the bike!\\
190 - Don't let me fall!\\
191 - Okay, I think we've made a lot of progress!\\
192 - That's enough for today!\\
193 - So, lately, I've been going to the library with Mom.\\
194 - That's all. I don't want anyone following us.\\
195 - Like I said, it's just the library, where we do...\\
196 - library things.\\
197 - Has anyone seen our bicycle pump?\\
198 - Hal's in. Your bet.\\
199 - Five dollars?\\
200 - -I'll call. -Hi, guys.\\
201 - -Where should I put this? -I'll take care of it.\\
202 - -Thanks. -Uh-huh.\\
203 - This is about the dental visit, isn't it?\\
204 - You know, I don't recall a dental visit.\\
205 - I recall a mugging!\\
206 - I'm surprised you'd bring it up, considering you ran out on the bill.\\
207 - -Con artist! -Welsher!\\
208 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's this about?\\
209 - I went to Trey to get my tooth fixed for free like he promised,\\
210 - and then this pirate hands me a bill for $2,000!\\
211 - Free?! I never said I'd fix it for free!\\
212 - -You said you'd take care of it! -And I took care of it!\\
213 - I fixed it!\\
214 - Now Hal is walking around here pain-free with a stolen smile!\\
215 - How dare you?!\\
216 - We were all here. Now, who's right?\\
217 - I think the answer is pretty clear.\\
218 - -Hal! -Trey!\\
219 - What are you talking about?\\
220 - The man said he'd take care of it.\\
221 - Everyone knows what that means.\\
222 - Yeah, it means he'd fix it for free.\\
223 - Thank you!\\
224 - You're just saying that because it was your cheap-ass caramel corn that broke his tooth in the first place.\\
225 - It had nothing to do with the caramel corn!\\
226 - Guys, guys, guys, this is ruining the game.\\
227 - Malik, you do mediation at your law firm.\\
228 - -Can't you help out? -Fine.\\
229 - Fellas, I want you both to just sit down and listen to each other.\\
230 - Trey, can't you see where "I'll take care of it" could be misinterpreted?\\
231 - -Well, I suppose it could. -Yeah!\\
232 - And, Hal, can't you see that Trey is a professional?\\
233 - He went to years of medical school.\\
234 - And then he gave up and became a dentist.\\
235 - Trey deserves to be compensated for his work.\\
236 - It's natural and it's fair.\\
237 - I guess it is.\\
238 - I'm sorry, Trey.\\
239 - No offense taken.\\
240 - So, Malik, how much do we owe you?\\
241 - Ah, nothing. We're friends.\\
242 - A-ha! You see?\\
243 - It's not the same!\\
244 - You came to me as a professional.\\
245 - You get a salary for your work.\\
246 - Imagine going to somebody's house, playing Tetris, shuffling papers\\
247 - and making long- distance calls, and nobody paid you?!\\
248 - That's it!\\
249 - I don't want your repo thugs coming after me, so here!\\
250 - So, Peterson puts the report on my desk and says, uh...\\
251 - Hal, if your tooth hurts, don't eat.\\
252 - I'm fine.\\
253 - -Hal, just stop it. -Stop what?\\
254 - We're all afraid you're going to choke to death.\\
255 - -You can't eat if you don't chew. -I don't need to chew.\\
256 - I am fine.\\
257 - The key is relaxing the esophagus.\\
258 - Jamie, I hope you're paying attention.\\
259 - So, Mom, how's the bike-a-thon going?\\
260 - Just great.\\
261 - -I'm really excited about it. -You are, huh?\\
262 - How long have you been riding?\\
263 - Long enough.\\
264 - Fascinating!\\
265 - Hey, you know what I could go for?\\
266 - Another piece of cake.\\
267 - There is no more.\\
268 - -What about that piece? -My piece?\\
269 - That's okay. I don't need another piece of cake.\\
270 - I can just continue talking.\\
271 - So, what was I talking about?\\
272 - Oh, yeah, your bike riding.\\
273 - These chairs are so uncomfortable.\\
274 - They have no idea how to conform to our bodies.\\
275 - Hal, you have an infection. You have to see a dentist.\\
276 - I made an appointment with Dr. Voorhees tomorrow.\\
277 - Isn't that the guy we took Dewey's hamster to?\\
278 - He's a doctor.\\
279 - If he isn't in the society pages, then you're not impressed, huh, Lois?\\
280 - Go back to Trey!\\
281 - -We'll find the money somehow. -No way!\\
282 - Well, you are going to have to find some way to deal with this.\\
283 - I know and I have.\\
284 - I'm not an idiot, Lois.\\
285 - Now, please, will you hand me my scream box?\\
286 - Hey, what's all the noise?\\
287 - You know the rule.\\
288 - The only sound allowed in this room is snoring.\\
289 - I've been waiting ten years to see Conrad Horner perform,\\
290 - and I overslept and completely missed it.\\
291 - Oh, he'll come back in a few years.\\
292 - He's 98.\\
293 - I got there in time to get a program off the floor and see his ambulance drive away.\\
294 - Oh, well.\\
295 - You know what would help?\\
296 - Sleep.\\
297 - I actually dreamed I was in this bed sleeping.\\
298 - Sleep is all we ever do anymore.\\
299 - Do you even know what day it is?\\
300 - I don't even know what year it is.\\
301 - Get up!\\
302 - Don't you have a test tomorrow?\\
303 - It could affect college, your future!\\
304 - I'm pursuing my dreams right here in a much more direct way.\\
305 - Well, I'm done with it.\\
306 - Fine! More room for me.\\
307 - So that's your plan?\\
308 - You're going to sleep for the rest of your life?\\
309 - That's pretty pathetic.\\
310 - I'll leave my mark.\\
311 - Long after I'm gone, the memory coils in this bed will still remember the contours of my body.\\
312 - Listen to yourself. That's insane.\\
313 - This bed is evil.\\
314 - It's draining your soul, Malcolm!\\
315 - Malcolm?\\
316 - Okay, Mom, I think today we might break the 12-inch distance record we set yesterday.\\
317 - It's white-knuckle time.\\
318 - I'm not doing this anymore.\\
319 - -What?! -You know I can't do it.\\
320 - I just cannot get on that bike again. It's just too hard.\\
321 - Oh, it's too hard?\\
322 - Well, why didn't you say so?\\
323 - When things get tough, you got to just give up and run away from your dreams.\\
324 - Lower your expectations.\\
325 - That's fine. I've had my fun.\\
326 - If you want to quit, go ahead and quit.\\
327 - All right, Reese, you made your point. Let's give it a try.\\
328 - No, I was really saying quit.\\
329 - I want to thank Hal for inviting us all over for a special afternoon game.\\
330 - I don't want to be the one to break up the game here.\\
331 - -I have nothing to be ashamed of. -If you're implying...\\
332 - Gentlemen, gentlemen, no one is implying anything.\\
333 - All I'm saying is it's hard keeping the game together.\\
334 - And despite our differences, I think we can all agree this is nothing like the hidden jack incident of '91.\\
335 - -Here we go. -You are damn right. Here we go.\\
336 - Don't throw around accusations. I will not be accused of cheating.\\
337 - I never said you were cheating.\\
338 - I said it looked like you were cheating. That's totally different.\\
339 - I don't need to cheat.\\
340 - You're not that good a poker player.\\
341 - So the card I needed to make my straight just decided on its own to leave the table?\\
342 - Guys, guys, come on.\\
343 - I'm just saying we made it through that,\\
344 - we can make it through this.\\
345 - I have a feeling by the end of this game,\\
346 - the problem will be solved.\\
347 - Show 'em.\\
348 - Pair of twos.\\
349 - Beats me.\\
350 - Me, too.\\
351 - Pair of two's the winner.\\
352 - Wow, I win again?\\
353 - Oh, I must be on a real lucky streak. I must have a thousand dollars here.\\
354 - Wait a minute.\\
355 - Dead hand. Cards over.\\
356 - You had a flush! Look!\\
357 - You're letting me win!\\
358 - You are?!\\
359 - We're just trying to get this thing settled.\\
360 - I don't want your money if I didn't win it.\\
361 - I have no need for your pity!\\
362 - I can't stand it anymore!\\
363 - I'll give you the dental work for free. Happy?\\
364 - Let's go right down to my office right now and put back that crown.\\
365 - -It's settled. -No!\\
366 - I am not some charity case,\\
367 - and I am not going to relieve you of your conscience, either.\\
368 - -Hal! -No!\\
369 - You will be the one to have to live with the pain, not me!\\
370 - Give me that glass of ice water!\\
371 - -No! -No!\\
372 - I hope you're happy!\\
373 - Hal, Stop! Think about it.\\
374 - -Hal! Hal! -Hal! Come on, Hal!\\
375 - My back's killing me.\\
376 - What happened?\\
377 - Malcolm, you're awake.\\
378 - We were worried about you for a while.\\
379 - What happened to the new mattress?\\
380 - -What are you talking about? -The mattress!\\
381 - I know there was a mattress.\\
382 - Maybe it was a dream.\\
383 - It wasn't a dream!\\
384 - The mattress was perfect and white, and it felt like a cloud!\\
385 - It fell out of the sky, and it made me happy!\\
386 - Was it just a bed, or was there a beanstalk, too?\\
387 - Maybe it was a dream.\\
388 - You were happy, Malcolm.\\
389 - Of course it was a dream.\\
390 - Okay, Mom, this is it.\\
391 - Once you're up, don't look down.\\
392 - -But... -Trust me.\\
393 - Just start pedaling.\\
394 - I'm going to make sure you get through this.\\
395 - You are not alone.\\
396 - -Thank you, Reese. -Now go!\\
397 - Oh, my God!\\
398 - I'm doing it!\\
399 - I'm riding!\\
400 - Don't worry, Mom! It's for your own good.\\
401 - Reese?!\\
402 - Try to go slow, Mom! I'm going to crash into you!\\
403 - I'm going to prove to you that falling isn't so bad!\\
404 - No, Reese, I'm doing fine, see?\\
405 - Mom, it's the only way!\\
406 - Reese, it worked!\\
407 - I'm not afraid.\\
408 - I can ride.\\
409 - Thank you.\\
410 - Mommy...\\
411 - Help me! Help me!\\
412 - So...\\
413 - Want to tell me what's going on here?\\
414 - It's cool, Officer.\\
415 - You see, we tied him up because he's got a painful, busted tooth,\\
416 - and he refused to let us fix it.\\
417 - Help! Help me!\\
418 - I need help!\\
419 - Okay. Drive safe.\\
420 - Thank you, sir.\\
421 - Help! Help me!\\
422 - Help me!

9 - They have really made some changes.\\
10 - They're used to be a Banana Republic over there.\\
11 - Now it's over there.\\
12 - Can we please just get my underwear and get out of here?\\
13 - Malcolm, you know it's hard to buy underwear for you.\\
14 - You have your father's irregular crotch.\\
15 - Nothing to be ashamed of, son.\\
16 - If a woman really loves you, it won't botherher a bit.\\
17 - Will you look at that?\\
18 - They turned a Soap Town into a Soap And Such.\\
19 - Hi. Are you here to take class?\\
20 - Yes, that's why I came in here, to take class.\\
21 - It's dancing, right?\\
22 - Yes. Just sign up at the counter.\\
23 - So, you're the new guy.\\
24 - What? Oh, yeah, hi.\\
25 - It's all right.\\
26 - I don't mind a little competition,\\
27 - but just so you know what you're up against.\\
28 - So the person who keeps his or her hand on the vehicle the longest\\
29 - is going to drive out of here in this brand-new truck!\\
30 - Oh, Hal, look at that truck.\\
31 - Can you imagine if we could finally get rid of the van?\\
32 - That piece of junk's costing us a hundred bucks a month in duct tape alone.\\
33 - All right, the contest is going to begin in ten seconds.\\
34 - If all the contestants are ready, here we go.\\
35 - In seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\\
36 - And we're off!\\
37 - I can't believe we never entered one of these contests before.\\
38 - It's going to be a long ride, honey.\\
39 - We got our first loser.\\
40 - Ha! Idiot!\\
41 - Number two.\\
42 - Ha! Damn it all to hell!\\
43 - Come on, pal, here we go, here we go.\\
44 - There we go.\\
45 - Oh, geez.\\
46 - No, no, no, Jamie!\\
47 - You have to stay in your chair until breakfast is ready, okay?\\
48 - Listen, your mommy's going to be home in a couple days,\\
49 - just as soon as she wins that truck.\\
50 - And then everything will be back to normal.\\
51 - Oh, eggs.\\
52 - Hello!\\
53 - Oh, hi, Hal, how's it going?\\
54 - Oh, uh, everything is...\\
55 - everything's great, honey.\\
56 - Oh, good. Listen, I was thinking this might be the perfect time for you to get to your "To Do" board.\\
57 - Well, um, you know, I am not sure that I'm going to be able to...\\
58 - Hal, I'm making this sacrifice for the whole family.\\
59 - I think the least you can do is catch up on some housework.\\
60 - Okay, okay, I'll talk to you later.\\
61 - Oh, geez.\\
62 - DO TO-DO LIST\\
63 - What was that?\\
64 - Nothing!\\
65 - Oh, my God, Dad's middle management trophy... The Middie.\\
66 - We have no choice but to confess and take the punishment.\\
67 - You're a good brother.\\
68 - Are you sure you've never danced before?\\
69 - No, never.\\
70 - You really have a gift.\\
71 - She's right.\\
72 - Turns out, I'm naturally talented at science and dancing...\\
73 - two things that are guaranteed to get you beat up.\\
74 - All right, partner up.\\
75 - You know, our dance competition's coming up next week.\\
76 - You can choose any girl in the class to be your partner.\\
77 - Really? Any girl?\\
78 - You and Danielle would be a dream together.\\
79 - Who?\\
80 - I think I need a little time to think about it.\\
81 - Say hi to Angela for me.\\
82 - So who's Angela?\\
83 - She's my best friend.\\
84 - He's helping her move.\\
85 - -Huh. -What?\\
86 - No, I am not worried about him and Angela.\\
87 - Good for you.\\
88 - I actually met my husband when he helped me move.\\
89 - Boy, there's nothing sexier than a man coming to the rescue.\\
90 - The two of you lug that mattress up the stairs, you get it laid down on the floor in the bedroom.\\
91 - You're both already sweaty.\\
92 - Anyway, I think you're making the right choice.\\
93 - A truck will never let you down.\\
94 - I've got to go.\\
95 - Oh, another one out !\\
96 - Can't we just throw the thing in the trash?\\
97 - That is the worst possible place.\\
98 - Dad accidentally throws his car keys out three times a week,\\
99 - and he always ends up going through the barrels.\\
100 - What was that?\\
101 - There's a handle here.\\
102 - Oh, my God, do you know what this means?\\
103 - Yes!\\
104 - Rabbits have been using our technology!\\
105 - No, it's a bomb shelter. People built these in the '50s and '60 in case of a nuclear war.\\
106 - This is incredible.\\
107 - What the hell... ?\\
108 - Dad?\\
109 - Boys, are you down there?\\
110 - Dad, look, we have a bomb shelter.\\
111 - Oh, good God.\\
112 - I never knew this was here.\\
113 - Isn't it amazing?\\
114 - All right, let's get out of here. We don't know how stable this place is.\\
115 - There could be snakes and rats and...\\
116 - Is that my trophy?\\
117 - Yeah.\\
118 - Here!\\
119 - You broke the Middie!\\
120 - They only give out 200 of these a year!\\
121 - Wait!\\
122 - Hurry, get the trash cans!\\
123 - You boys let me out of here!\\
124 - You better not burry me in here with the rats!\\
125 - You want to see what's on TV?\\
126 - Okay.\\
127 - Help me out!\\
128 - They let me pick Hanna as my partner.\\
129 - We really got a shot at winning this competition.\\
130 - Plus, I get to touch her body, like, a lot.\\
131 - Sorry.\\
132 - Dad, if you can hear me, knock once on the hatch.\\
133 - Okay, it's pretty obvious we've all made some mistakes here.\\
134 - There's no point in trying to figure out who's right and who's wrong.\\
135 - The important thing is you forgive us so we can forgive you so we can let you out.\\
136 - Now if we're all on the same page, knock once on the lid.\\
137 - He agreed. We're both witnesses.\\
138 - You know Dad, I really think...\\
139 - It's a trick!\\
140 - I just...!\\
141 - Vengeance!\\
142 - Back, Dad!\\
143 - Back, Dad!\\
144 - Back!\\
145 - Back!\\
146 - I don't know if I can trust Dad after this.\\
147 - You're insane.\\
148 - I'm just saying, how much food could there be down there?\\
149 - Eventually, this will take care of itself.\\
150 - Reese!\\
151 - He's had a long life.\\
152 - What is he, like, 70?\\
153 - Forget it.\\
154 - Ah, you're right.\\
155 - I forgot about Mom.\\
156 - She's bound to notice eventually, no matter how busy she is.\\
157 - And once she latches onto something, you know how she never lets it go.\\
158 - Well, hello.\\
159 - Mr. President.\\
160 - Well, looks like we're in this Cold War together.\\
161 - So, Jack...\\
162 - what are you drinking?\\
163 - So what if she's a klutz? She's still beautiful, right?\\
164 - I can't wait for the competition.\\
165 - You and me out there in front of everyone?\\
166 - All right, she's totally hot, but she's got no presence.\\
167 - Her footwork's sloppy and her jazz square'sall over the place.\\
168 - I'm just going to have to make my peace with this.\\
169 - I chose Hanna for the contest and now there's nothing I can do about it.\\
170 - Oh, my ankle!\\
171 - I'm so sorry. Are you all right?\\
172 - It hurts.\\
173 - I can't stand on it.\\
174 - Oh, my God, what a terrible accident.\\
175 - It was an accident.\\
176 - I'm so sorry.\\
177 - It was.\\
178 - Good! Perfect.\\
179 - All right now just turn and...\\
180 - I'm so glad you were still available for the competition.\\
181 - I was really upset by Hanna's, um...\\
182 - accidental injury, but I think you and I might win this thing.\\
183 - Well, if we can do it with our dancing,\\
184 - maybe you could stop sleeping with the judges.\\
185 - That'll free up my evenings.\\
186 - Who knew she banters, too.\\
187 - Salisbury steak... my old friend.\\
188 - Ha-cha.\\
189 - Hello, ladies.\\
190 - Dad?\\
191 - Dad, you alive?\\
192 - The minute I get out of here, you boys are in so much...\\
193 - ...trouble!\\
194 - Hey, if he's not willing to negotiate, we've got no choice.\\
195 - We're going to have to split up.\\
196 - Okay, I'll meet you in Mexico in five years.\\
197 - Wait a minute.\\
198 - What if we do everything on his "To Do" board and then let him out?\\
199 - That's brilliant.\\
200 - He couldn't be mad at us if we did all this for him.\\
201 - He's got stuff on here that he's been meaning to do for years.\\
202 - "Change Dewey's diaper."\\
203 - So, for the contest, what do you think we should wear?\\
204 - I was thinking about a really hot sequined backless number.\\
205 - And for me, something classy.\\
206 - Just so you know, I was holding back in there.\\
207 - You two have no idea what I'm going to unleash tomorrow at the contest.\\
208 - Well, if it's anything like what you unleashed during stretching, we're pulling out of the competition.\\
209 - Insults are for those who can't express themselves... in motion!\\
210 - I think I'm falling in love with him.\\
211 - You, too?\\
212 - So, I'll see you tomorrow?\\
213 - Right.\\
214 - Oh, there was one more thing.\\
215 - Nope, that wasn't it.\\
216 - See ya.\\
217 - I'm sure it's nothing, Cheryl, but you'll probably feel better after a doctor's taken a look at it.\\
218 - There's another one. She's down and we're here in the...\\
219 - Wow, Mom, just four left. That's great.\\
220 - Yeah, and it'll be three before you know it.\\
221 - Mom, I need some advice on something.\\
222 - Sure.\\
223 - I started taking this dance class, and...\\
224 - Good for you.\\
225 - I just signed up to meet a girl.\\
226 - Of course.\\
227 - I got to dance with the girl I wanted, but...\\
228 - she had an accident and I started dancing with this other girl and...\\
229 - I didn't think there'd anything other than dancing there, and...\\
230 - And now she likes you and you're going to break her heart?\\
231 - No, that's not it.\\
232 - I like her, too.\\
233 - You both like each other?\\
234 - Yeah.\\
235 - So why are you bothering me?\\
236 - I'm working here.\\
237 - The point is I like her, but she's not exactly what I consider to be...\\
238 - a cute girl.\\
239 - Oh, this is going to be a tricky one.\\
240 - Here, hold this.\\
241 - What is wrong with you?\\
242 - You're attracted to her, she's attracted to you.\\
243 - The only problem is in your head.\\
244 - Listen, if you're trying to build relationships on looks, you are in for a world hurt.\\
245 - Take Janet here.\\
246 - 20 years ago she marries her husband because she thinks he looks like Lee Majors.\\
247 - And today he's lost all his hair, he's gained 200 pounds,\\
248 - and she is stuck with a blimp who won't even put on his shirt to come to the dinner table.\\
249 - She is reduced to trying to win attention by bringing home a truck. I mean, how sad is that?\\
250 - That is what I'm doing, isn't it?\\
251 - There's another one.\\
252 - 36 down. There's only three left here, ladies and gentlemen.\\
253 - You see that ?\\
254 - That took courage.\\
255 - I'll tell you, Jack, they made women in those days.\\
256 - There's nothing wrong with a little meat on the bones.\\
257 - Now that is a fanny.\\
258 - Ah, Jack, you died too young.\\
259 - We beat 'em.\\
260 - Now they're wearing blue jeans and eating cheeseburgers in Red Square.\\
261 - Oh, and we made it to the moon.\\
262 - Big waste of money.\\
263 - l'll tell you what I miss the most, Jack.\\
264 - All these years, we have never had a president as cool as you.\\
265 - Here's to you, buddy.\\
266 - You're right to look at me like that.\\
267 - You just can't drink a martini without an olive.\\
268 - Oh, would you look at that. We have a back door.\\
269 - I'll be right back, Jack.\\
270 - After you finish the fireplace, I'll start scrubbing the shower tiles.\\
271 - And I'll give Jamie a bath, then we can both do the gutters.\\
272 - All right, but first we have to shampoo the rug to give it time to dry.\\
273 - If you are 99% sure you turned your oven off, don't drive yourself crazy.\\
274 - Besides, dogs have an instinct to run away from fire.\\
275 - Well, there was number three.\\
276 - And then they were two.\\
277 - Don't go anywere, folks, we're going to crown a winner.\\
278 - So it's just you and me.\\
279 - All the little children have gone home.\\
280 - You have any kids?\\
281 - Four.\\
282 - Five.\\
283 - -Epidurals? -Please.\\
284 - You tear?\\
285 - Like an old sock.\\
286 - All right ladies, it's time for another bathroom break.\\
287 - You're not taking a break, Mabel?\\
288 - I'm good.\\
289 - Me, too.\\
290 - Hey, Danielle. Before we go there, there's something I need to tell you.\\
291 - I like you a lot.\\
292 - You do?\\
293 - I mean, great.\\
294 - You know, I'd never would have expected it.\\
295 - And now, Malcolm and Danielle.\\
296 - Why wouldn't you have expected it?\\
297 - Huh?\\
298 - Why wouldn't you have expected to like me?\\
299 - It wasn't a criticism of you. It's just that...\\
300 - Sometimes I can be really shallow about these things.\\
301 - Malcolm?\\
302 - So what kind of guys do you like when you're shallow?\\
303 - No, it's nothing. It's just that...\\
304 - I've made mistakes in the past going after guys just based on their looks.\\
305 - So you almost didn't go out with me because I'm not good-looking enough?\\
306 - Would you let it go, okay? I like you.\\
307 - Now dip me.\\
308 - -Face or body? -What?\\
309 - Face or body, which don't you like?\\
310 - Or maybe you don't like any of it.\\
311 - It's all fine.\\
312 - It's good enough. Now dip me.\\
313 - I can't believe you'd think like that.\\
314 - For God's sakes!\\
315 - You know, you're no prize.\\
316 - No, we can't let Dad out until we do everything on the list.\\
317 - If Dad's going to act like...\\
318 - I can explain.\\
319 - Wait a minute.\\
320 - You've been sneaking out the whole time?\\
321 - Is that party mix?\\
322 - You're damn right it's party mix.\\
323 - This is the only thing that has kept me sane while I was trapped in that hellhole.\\
324 - Then why are you going back?\\
325 - I am not on trial here.\\
326 - I can't believe he wasn't really trapped.\\
327 - Come on, Dewey, let's go mess up the house.\\
328 - I did it! I won the truck!\\
329 - Lois, you're not going to believe what these boys have done.\\
330 - -They trapped me in a hole... I was there for three days. -He wasn't trapped...\\
331 - Did you hear what I said? I said I won the truck!\\
332 - -Oh, my God! -You won the truck!\\
333 - We won the truck!\\
334 - We won the truck!\\
335 - We won the truck!\\
336 - We won the truck!\\
337 - Let's go for a ride.\\
338 - Just a sec.\\
339 - First I have to change my pants.
\subsection {Episode 19: Stevie in the Hospital}
1 - Jamie, time to get going. Let's put your shoes on.\\
2 - Wonder what's gotten into him.\\
3 - I have no idea.\\
4 - Now pay attention. I'm only going to show this to you one more time.\\
5 - The rabbit comes out of his hole,\\
6 - and runs around the tree.\\
7 - But he won't stop laughing at you.\\
8 - So you grab him by the tail\\
9 - and it rips off in your hand.\\
10 - You follow the trail of blood back to his hole.\\
11 - And then you reach in, pull the rabbit out and then you strangle him!\\
12 - And then you're ready to walk around.\\

16 - What do you say, Reese?\\
17 - You want to take the new boat out this afternoon?\\
18 - Maiden voyage. Just you and me.\\
19 - Father and son slicing through the waves, wind in our hair.\\
20 - And look.\\
21 - I re-did the aft bathroom.\\
22 - Sorry, Dad, I start my new job today.\\
23 - Oh, come on!\\
24 - You don't actually do any work the first day.\\
25 - You're just filling out forms and deciding on a nemesis.\\
26 - Did you know how hard it was to get this job?\\
27 - Everywhere else I applied called my references.\\
28 - Thank God telemarketing has no standards.\\
29 - Basically, I get to harass old people and shut-ins all day.\\
30 - I'm getting paid to do what I love.\\
31 - -Picture this, Dewey... -Not gonna happen.\\
32 - Give me one good reason.\\
33 - You're forcing me to say exactly why I don't want to do this\\
34 - and it's not going to make you happy and it's not going to make me happy.\\
35 - So why don't we just leave it alone?\\
36 - How 'bout it, Malcolm?\\
37 - You're gonna be out of the house soon.\\
38 - This could be our last chance to spend some quality together time.\\
39 - I can't, Dad.\\
40 - You know it was Stevie's big surgery yesterday.\\
41 - They just moved him out of intensive care and I really want to go visit him.\\
42 - Damn!\\
43 - See you tonight.\\
44 - Mom, did you remember to buy the baking soda for my class project?\\
45 - Ah, I forgot.\\
46 - What? I asked you like five times.\\
47 - That I remember.\\
48 - My science partner's going to hate me.\\
49 - I was supposed to bring in the baking soda for a volcano.\\
50 - Now it's just going to be a mountain full of vinegar.\\
51 - Just do what your brother did.\\
52 - Take the baby powder and blame the guy who brought the vinegar.\\
53 - I'm glad you changed your mind and decided to join me.\\
54 - It's nice to know that at least one of my sons isn't too busy to spend a little time with the old man.\\
55 - Oh, here, look.\\
56 - The deck is real teak.\\
57 - There's even a working foghorn. Listen.\\
58 - Easy, it's not a toy.\\
59 - You're sitting on my bench.\\
60 - What?\\
61 - That's my bench.\\
62 - I don't think anybody owns the benches, young man.\\
63 - I'm sure you can... find another one.\\
64 - I don't want to find another one.\\
65 - I always sit here.\\
66 - Jamie, I'll handle this.\\
67 - Kid, I didn't see you wiping off the pigeon poop with your son's blankie.\\
68 - I've earned this bench so take a hike.\\
69 - Okay, let's set her out there and aim for the horizon.\\
70 - She's in God's hands now.\\
71 - Well... in mine.\\
72 - Steady.\\
73 - Steady as she goes.\\
74 - Look at her.\\
75 - She is yar.\\
76 - Are you crazy?!\\
77 - What do you think you're doing?!\\
78 - I'm think I'm sinking your boat!\\
79 - Ma'am, anyone who enjoys breathing will benefit from the new Ionator 5150.\\
80 - This amazing all natural purifier has been proven to remove 63%...\\
81 - ...of all airborne pathogens including asbestos,\\
82 - cigarette smoke and Taiwanese dust mites.\\
83 - If you order now, we guarantee...\\
84 - ...you'll probably be dead by morning.\\
85 - But you're right, buddy, your life's not worth 50 bucks,\\
86 - so please let me off the phone so I can start saving people who want to live.\\
87 - All right, fine, I'll put you down for two, but next time, don't jerk me around.\\
88 - How's everything going over here?\\
89 - People are so stupid they'll believe anything.\\
90 - I threw the fact sheet out the window and just started making stuff up.\\
91 - Ah, no problem. I made up the fact sheet.\\
92 - Six sales in 20 minutes. You're a natural.\\
93 - Keep this up and you got a good shot at winning the sales contest.\\
94 - What contest?\\
95 - We're tallying total sales over on the big board.\\
96 - First prize is a flat-screen TV.\\
97 - Second prize is a barbecue grill.\\
98 - Third prize is one of our air purifiers.\\
99 - But believe me, you don't want that.\\
100 - Keep up the good work.\\
101 - Hello, I'm calling from Air Scrub Air Filters.\\
102 - No, no, no, don't put Mommy on the phone.\\
103 - Just get her credit card.\\
104 - How was Stevie?\\
105 - I didn't get to see him.\\
106 - You left for the hospital over three hours ago.\\
107 - I tried taking the express bus,\\
108 - but somehow I ended up on a shuttle to the airport.\\
109 - Seriously, they need to label those things better.\\
110 - They're bright red and say "airport shuttle" on the side.\\
111 - We drove right past the hospital, but the stupid driver wouldn't let me out.\\
112 - When did people stop caring?\\
113 - Calm down, Malcolm. It's no big deal. You can go tomorrow.\\
114 - Yeah, if the buses will let me.\\
115 - Hey, sweetie, how was your day?\\
116 - I love this new job.\\
117 - If you claim to be a doctor on the phone, no one questions it, not even other doctors.\\
118 - All right, would someone care to explain something to me?\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Why is this sleeve slightly shorter than this sleeve?\\
121 - Maybe one of your arms is getting longer.\\
122 - They're not. I measured them.\\
123 - That's crazy.\\
124 - Oh, you'd like me to think so,\\
125 - but I know someone has been messing with my stuff.\\
126 - The mirrors on my car are askew, my toothbrush is wet,\\
127 - and the lint trap in the dryer, which I emptied this morning, is now magically full of lint.\\
128 - Should you even be doing laundry in this condition?\\
129 - I want to know who's responsible and I want to know now.\\
130 - Mom, why would we do any of that to you?\\
131 - Yeah, Mom, why would we?\\
132 - Excuse me, what room is Stevie Kenarban in?\\
133 - Let me check.\\
134 - He's in room 220 right up the elevator.\\
135 - Thank you.\\
136 - I was going to come visit yesterday morning,\\
137 - but I had this giant hole in my lunch bag and everything just spilled out.\\
138 - My tuna sandwich was fine,\\
139 - but my orange started rolling down this hill, and by the time I caught up with it,\\
140 - I was late for school.\\
141 - It's still room 220.\\
142 - Where would it be possible to find a gift?\\
143 - I would try the gift shop.\\
144 - Good idea. Thanks.\\
145 - You're welcome.\\
146 - Can I help you find something?\\
147 - Yeah, do you have any cards that don't say "Get well"?\\
148 - This is a hospital. Usually, we're rooting for the patient.\\
149 - I get it, it's just that all these cards are really generic.\\
150 - And this is for my best friend, so I need something special.\\
151 - How about flowers?\\
152 - I'm not asking him to marry me.\\
153 - This bear's pretty popular.\\
154 - Let's see.\\
155 - He's allergic to the fur, the stuffing plastic eyes.\\
156 - And what's this tag made out of?\\
157 - Okay...\\
158 - Let's go with the hula guy.\\
159 - You're sure?\\
160 - Definitely.\\
161 - So we've narrowed it down to ten possibilities.\\
162 - Let's go over the pros and cons one more time.\\
163 - Attention: It is now 9:00. Visiting hours are over.\\
164 - What?\\
165 - I can't believe you let this happen!\\
166 - Reese is sales machine.\\
167 - If he keeps up this pace, he's going to win the whole thing.\\
168 - Don't worry.\\
169 - I gave him the list of people that told us to go to hell.\\
170 - Listen, we wouldn't be calling again if it wasn't an emergency.\\
171 - The utility company's informed us that there's an alarming amount of graydon in your home.\\
172 - Now, your family's been chosen to survive,\\
173 - but your neighbors aren't going to be so lucky.\\
174 - Look, don't buy it from Air Scrub.\\
175 - Buy it from one of our competitors. I gave you the number, but for the love of God hurry!\\
176 - Happy Air, how may I help you?\\
177 - And there isn't any kind of construction or quarantines,\\
178 - and you're not planning on moving the hospital before I can get there?\\
179 - Fine. Go take care of your precious bus crash.\\
180 - I want to make sure I cover all my bases.\\
181 - I got the directions,\\
182 - I got a gift, his favorite cookies.\\
183 - This time there's nothing that can stop me from visiting Stevie.\\
184 - There are very few things in this world as valuable as friendship.\\
185 - Damn.\\
186 - What's wrong, Dad?\\
187 - Nothing, I just put the battery in backwards.\\
188 - Oh, God. Why now?\\
189 - I can't leave him like this.\\
190 - I'm here for you, Dad.\\
191 - I think I can handle it, Malcolm.\\
192 - I just need to get a little water out of the hull.\\
193 - How'd that happen?\\
194 - It's nothing.\\
195 - Some punk kid swamped me.\\
196 - And you're just gonna let him get away with that?\\
197 - It's no big deal. I'll just go to another part of the lake.\\
198 - Why? So he can sink you there, too?\\
199 - You've to fight back.\\
200 - What did you always teach me about standing up for myself?\\
201 - I can't beat up a ten-year-old.\\
202 - I suppose I could hold him down while you hit him.\\
203 - No, Dad. Let's beat him on the water.\\
204 - With just a few modifications, we can make this boat unstoppable.\\
205 - We can reinforce the rudder for better steering and put a titanium tip on the prow.\\
206 - We'll slice his boat in half!\\
207 - We can really do all that?\\
208 - Absolutely.\\
209 - Could we put a little skipper on the deck?\\
210 - I don't see why not.\\
211 - Malcolm, it's times like these I'm certain you weren't switched at birth.\\
212 - Thanks, Dad.\\
213 - Now come on. We got a lot of work to do.\\
214 - Cookie?\\
215 - Oh, thank you.\\
216 - Gotcha!\\
217 - Sorry, Hal, I thought you were someone else.\\
218 - What are you doing?\\
219 - How long have you been in there?\\
220 - Just a few hours.\\
221 - A few hours?!\\
222 - What's going on?\\
223 - I don't know, Hal.\\
224 - I think one of the boys is screwing with me.\\
225 - My bookmark was on the wrong page.\\
226 - I found a loose thread on my smock.\\
227 - The car radio was tuned to a station next to the one that I always listen to.\\
228 - Oh, my God, I sound insane, don't I?\\
229 - Honey, what you need is to take a step back and clear your head.\\
230 - You know what helps me?\\
231 - Working with Malcolm to weaponize my boat.\\
232 - I understand you're very upset,\\
233 - but if you'd just let me get a word in.\\
234 - I know I'm the new guy, but you've been on the phone for a half hour and you haven't close this deal?\\
235 - Remember your ABCs.\\
236 - Always Be Selling.\\
237 - I can't interrupt him when he's in the middle of...\\
238 - Hey, this isn't tele-listening.\\
239 - Give me the phone.\\
240 - I'll show you how to churn butter.\\
241 - All right, gabby, we have better things to do than talk to you all day.\\
242 - Now, give me one reason why you don't need an air purifier.\\
243 - I'm going to kill myself.\\
244 - Nice try.\\
245 - I use that excuse all the time.\\
246 - No, I'm serious.\\
247 - I just feel like I can't go on.\\
248 - I'm clinically depressed.\\
249 - And my cat dies because he was allergic to me!\\
250 - Oh, and my wife rans off with my brother Ted,\\
251 - and then my family just touched the inside that I'm not allowed to...\\
252 - Get the manual!\\
253 - All right, Dewey, I know what's going on. I know it's you.\\
254 - If it were Reese, he'd be bragging to everyone about it.\\
255 - Malcolm doesn't have the patience.\\
256 - So, that leaves you, Dewey.\\
257 - If I had any proof, we'd be having this conversation while I was walling you up inside your bedroom closet.\\
258 - This is about the volcano, isn't it?\\
259 - All right, I acknowledge that perhaps I was a little inconsiderate of your needs,\\
260 - but that in no way justifies these petty attacks.\\
261 - Still, we have to move on.\\
262 - So, here's the deal:\\
263 - In the future, I promise to be more attentive and aware of your feelings,\\
264 - not that being the loving mother I am, I wouldn't be doing that anyway.\\
265 - And in return,\\
266 - you will promise to stop this stupid campaign to drive me crazy.\\
267 - Just give me a little sign that we understand each other.\\
268 - Good.\\
269 - Now, just be cool, Malcolm.\\
270 - As far as anyone knows, we're just a normal father and son who love each other.\\
271 - Stay calm.\\
272 - There's a woman with a stroller.\\
273 - Wave with me so it looks natural.\\
274 - Good, she's buying it. Arms down.\\
275 - No one suspects a thing.\\
276 - Steer clear of those ducks.\\
277 - We'll deal with them later.\\
278 - I hope this kid shows up soon.\\
279 - I was planning on visiting Stevie today.\\
280 - You just saw him yesterday, didn't you?\\
281 - Not exactly.\\
282 - But you did see him over the weekend, right?\\
283 - No.\\
284 - Wait.\\
285 - How many times have you seen Stevie?\\
286 - If you add them all up...\\
287 - none.\\
288 - None?\\
289 - Malcolm, I can't believe what I'm hearing.\\
290 - Your best friend is in the hospital, and you're here helping me stalk a ten-year-old.\\
291 - I'm trying, but visiting someone in the hospital isn't as easy as you might think.\\
292 - Malcolm, don't you see what you're doing?\\
293 - You're just avoiding an unpleasant situation.\\
294 - I know.\\
295 - It's just that Stevie and I have never really talked seriously about his illnesses.\\
296 - We've kind of had this unspoken agreement that he was just a regular kid.\\
297 - If I had to see him lying in his hospital bed,\\
298 - hooked up to God knows what, it's kind of hard to pretend like nothing's wrong.\\
299 - I just don't know what to say.\\
300 - Son, don't think about it.\\
301 - Sometimes all you have to say is hello.\\
302 - That's a great way to put it.\\
303 - So simple.\\
304 - I got it off that bus bench over there.\\
305 - It's an ad for a long-distance company.\\
306 - You get yourself down to that hospital and show Stevie that you give a damn.\\
307 - -Thanks, Dad. -All right.\\
308 - It's high noon somewhere.\\
309 - Not this time.\\
310 - Oh, no! What am I ever going to do?\\
311 - What about this?\\
312 - Say hello to my little friend!\\
313 - Hey, you broke my boat!\\
314 - It's that kind of party, little man.\\
315 - That was my grandad's boat.\\
316 - He gave it to me before he died.\\
317 - He started it.\\
318 - There just doesn't seem like there's any reason to go on living.\\
319 - I'm overweight, I don't have any friends. I just...\\
320 - Look, look, this is pointless.\\
321 - I'm just gonna hang up now. No one cares about me.\\
322 - Listen, Lyle.\\
323 - I'm as lost as you are.\\
324 - I mean... I may not even graduate high school.\\
325 - I'm completely broke.\\
326 - If I disappeared, who would notice?\\
327 - But now I've got a purpose.\\
328 - Maybe you and I were meant to talk today.\\
329 - You mean like... like fate?\\
330 - Exactly.\\
331 - Maybe life is like a roller coaster,\\
332 - and you only go down so you can fun coming back up.\\
333 - Maybe.\\
334 - Well, I... I actually feel a little better.\\
335 - Now, this is what I want you to do.\\
336 - I want you to walk to the bathroom,\\
337 - and I want to hear you flush those pills down the toilet.\\
338 - They're gone.\\
339 - I-I did it.\\
340 - I don't know what to say. Thank you, Reese.\\
341 - Thank you.\\
342 - Don't thank me, Lyle.\\
343 - This is all you.\\
344 - You should feel good about yourself for what you did today.\\
345 - You should treat yourself to something really nice.\\
346 - Why don't you take out your credit card and buy a dozen air purifiers.\\
347 - Well, that... That sounds a little expensive.\\
348 - I just saved your life and now you're questioning me?!\\
349 - Look, I'm, I'm sorry. I was just saying...\\
350 - Every minute I'm talking to you, the price is going up!\\
351 - I want those numbers now, do you hear me?\\
352 - Let me find my wallet...\\
353 - Just give him the damn TV.\\
354 - Look who's in the hospital.\\
355 - Stevie Kenarban. What a surprise.\\
356 - Well, if you think I came down here to feel sorry for you,\\
357 - you've got another think coming.\\
358 - 'Cause I didn't feel sorry for you when they bolted your spine or you got that mold on your brain,\\
359 - and I'm not going to feel sorry for you now.\\
360 - Glad you didn't die.\\
361 - See you when you get out.\\
362 - Oh, and here's your cookie.\\
363 - I told you... he'd come.
\subsection {Episode 20: Cattle Court}
1 - Dewey.\\
2 - Is that what I think it is?\\
3 - You know the rules about animals in the house.\\
4 - Okay, okay, I'll get rid of it.\\
5 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.20 - "Cattle Court"\\
6 - Synchronisation par Tyno, Script original par Raceman.\\
7 - Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.tk & Malcolm-France.com\\
8 - And we can all thank Reese for the wonderful dinner he brought home from work.\\
9 - Oh, way to go, son.\\
10 - And someday, all that toner I keep bringing home will come in handy, too.\\
11 - So, what's new and exciting down at the old meat packing plant?\\
12 - Tons.\\
13 - They have me back on the floor where all the action is.\\
14 - And they upgraded to the new Slaughter-Bot.\\
15 - Now it has six chainsaw arms, and it doesn't get jammed on the horns anymore.\\
16 - You people wonder why I wake up screaming all the time.\\
17 - Dig in, everybody.\\
18 - What kind of meat is that?\\
19 - Don't knock it.\\
20 - This is the stuff that keeps the cow from falling apart.\\
21 - So, Malcolm, you have any exciting plans for when you're grounded this weekend?\\
22 - You gonna alphabetize all the stuff in your closet?\\
23 - Or you can update all those exciting new countries onto your globe.\\
24 - Hey, you could finally give the corns on your feet the attention they deserve.\\
25 - It's bad enough you're punishing me.\\
26 - You don't have to mock me while I'm so miserable.\\
27 - I am so happy.\\
28 - I'm sneaking out to a concert Friday night while Mom works the late shift.\\
29 - The band sucks, but I have backstage passes.\\
30 - And if that's even one-billionth as insane as I've always imagined it, I can die happy.\\
31 - Well...\\
32 - I couldn't eat another bite.\\
33 - The pay channels seem to be on an unusually low scramble tonight, so if you'll all excuse me.\\
34 - Dad?\\
35 - What's this?\\
36 - "This coupon entitles you to one free game night with Dad."\\
37 - Let's go.\\
38 - Dewey, I wrote this in a blind panic in the hall closet while everyone was singing you "Happy Birthday."\\
39 - You're not gonna hold me to this, are you?\\
40 - Does it have an expiration date?\\
41 - No.\\
42 - Listen, I'll tell you what.\\
43 - In exchange for this, I'll give you two coupons good for future services.\\
44 - What kind of pack rat are you?\\
45 - Don't you ever throw anything away?\\
46 - All right, fine!\\
47 - Let's go.\\
48 - And I'll start burning through some of these free hugs. I don't need them hanging over my head.\\
49 - I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't sell you that box.\\
50 - It's damaged.\\
51 - I don't see any damage.\\
52 - Thank you for choosing Lucky Aide.\\
53 - Craig, I need you to cover my Friday night shift.\\
54 - There's a lifetime movie I want to see.\\
55 - Heather Locklear is a welfare mom trying to get her kids back.\\
56 - Friday?\\
57 - I wouldn't want you to miss that, Lois.\\
58 - I cried my eyes out at the part where...\\
59 - Shh!\\
60 - Right. We'll talk later.\\
61 - Craig, how could you let her do that to you?\\
62 - I would have totally spilled the romance with the hunky social worker.\\
63 - No. Why do you let her push you around like that?\\
64 - She didn't even ask.\\
65 - She just assumed that you'd have nothing better to do than to pick up her crappy shifts.\\
66 - That's not right.\\
67 - She does this all the time.\\
68 - She takes advantage of you without any consideration of your feelings.\\
69 - Doesn't that upset you?\\
70 - I guess I am a little cheesed off.\\
71 - There you go.\\
72 - I knew you were too much of a man to let her get away with this.\\
73 - You're gonna show her that Craig Feldspar can't be pushed around.\\
74 - Thank you, Malcolm, for opening my eyes.\\
75 - You've awoken a sleeping giant, and he's very cranky.\\
76 - Six, seven,\\
77 - eight, nine, ten.\\
78 - I win.\\
79 - Wow, I smoked you again, Dad.\\
80 - Looks like I'm just better at life than you.\\
81 - Good for you, Dewey.\\
82 - But I hope you know that this isn't how things work in the real world.\\
83 - It's very oversimplified.\\
84 - I mean, you can't just break into a zoo, roll a couple of elevens and suddenly become the dean of a university.\\
85 - I did.\\
86 - Son, I'm just trying to give you a life lesson here.\\
87 - Yes, that's my orange limo sitting at the finish line, isn't it?\\
88 - Interesting.\\
89 - Dewey goes straight to bed with no dessert.\\
90 - Interesting.\\
91 - Here's your seat, Reese... all warmed up.\\
92 - And a low-carb lunch just like you asked for.\\
93 - No, thanks.\\
94 - I brought my own lunch today.\\
95 - What?\\
96 - You can't have blood sausage without the blood, can you?\\
97 - You'd better get moving.\\
98 - I have science next period, and those lab stools are freezing.\\
99 - Is it okay if I sit here?\\
100 - This is on a dare, huh?\\
101 - If you have to touch me, I'm okay with that,\\
102 - but I have to approve any photographs.\\
103 - No, it's just that I couldn't sit and watch kids eating the flesh of murdered animals.\\
104 - Is that the special?\\
105 - Is that why you're sitting alone?\\
106 - Are you a vegetarian, too?\\
107 - Yes, I am.\\
108 - The very thought of eating meat makes my taste buds cry in disgust.\\
109 - I just thought I was the only one.\\
110 - You're not alone.\\
111 - -Hi. How are you doing? -Hi.\\
112 - So, Craig,\\
113 - did you tell my mom that you couldn't cover her shift for her Friday night?\\
114 - Oh, I think I did far better than that.\\
115 - Huh?\\
116 - Patience, my friend. My trap is about to spring.\\
117 - This stupid pen doesn't work.\\
118 - I was up all night scribbling with it.\\
119 - Watch her face as her whole world comes crumbling down.\\
120 - Okay, I didn't see that coming.\\
121 - But who would?\\
122 - That's it? That's what you did to get back at her?\\
123 - Relax, Malcolm. That is just the first course in my tasty menu of revenge.\\
124 - That was supposed to stick.\\
125 - Don't worry, her finger sponge is as dry as a bone.\\
126 - Dad?\\
127 - What's going on? I got your message at school.\\
128 - Is everything okay?\\
129 - Everything's about to be.\\
130 - Have a seat.\\
131 - You pulled me out of a math test to play a game with you?\\
132 - This is much more important than some useless math test.\\
133 - I have to make sure that you understand you got lucky last time.\\
134 - Life won't always go your way, Dewey.\\
135 - And the sooner you learn that lesson, the better.\\
136 - Sit down.\\
137 - Sit.\\
138 - "You study hard and become an astronaut."\\
139 - All right.\\
140 - Wha... ?!\\
141 - What... what kind of lesson is this stupid game teaching you?!\\
142 - Where's the card that tells you your hemorrhoids are not covered by your health plan, huh?!\\
143 - Oh, would that not make a fun game?\\
144 - Hey, Malcolm. Did you know that henna parties were so last year?\\
145 - I had no clue.\\
146 - Craig, I just checked the schedule and it still says that you're covering for my mom Friday night.\\
147 - I thought you were going to do something about that.\\
148 - Oh, I think she suffered enough.\\
149 - Her name tag's been on upside down all night.\\
150 - Craig, don't you want to be taken seriously?\\
151 - I'm taken seriously.\\
152 - No, you're not.\\
153 - Especially not by my mom.\\
154 - She has nothing but complete and utter contempt for you.\\
155 - That's not true.\\
156 - Oh, yeah? She said the reason she ever makes eye-contact with you is because the rest of you is too hard to look at.\\
157 - She did?\\
158 - And you think she doesn't know that her name tag's upside down?\\
159 - Of course she does. She just doesn't care,\\
160 - because it was only Craig the doormat who did it.\\
161 - You mean nothing to her.\\
162 - Nothing at all.\\
163 - You have to stand up to her.\\
164 - For once in your life, Craig, be a man!\\
165 - I hate her!\\
166 - Okay, so I lied and destroyed a man so I could go to a concert.\\
167 - I'll get him a T-shirt.\\
168 - There.\\
169 - I've just got to remember third, fourth and ninth leaves and every other tomato.\\
170 - I don't understand wou can't just eat vegetarian for one meal.\\
171 - You know I get my headaches if I go too long without meat.\\
172 - And you don't see lying to Carrie as a problem?\\
173 - Come on, Dewey, tell me how this is any different than her wearing makeup?\\
174 - It's not about me it's about her fantasy of me.\\
175 - And I owe it to her to live up to that fantasy.\\
176 - Now hand me that stapler.\\
177 - This is amazing.\\
178 - Isn't it great finding someone with the same values?\\
179 - Exactly.\\
180 - We couldn't be more on the same page.\\
181 - Hey, give me back my hat!\\
182 - You want your hat back, come and get it.\\
183 - Oh. Oh, no.\\
184 - Hey, look at those gorgeous dogs.\\
185 - Who gives a crap?\\
186 - I mean, except us.\\
187 - When is America going to finally realize that dogs are not our enemy?\\
188 - Wow, they really love you.\\
189 - Yeah. This happens all the time.\\
190 - I guess they can smell that I really love animals.\\
191 - Get out of here, you mangy bastards!\\
192 - What? What's wrong, Reese?\\
193 - Hey, you know what I realize?\\
194 - That is not my hat.\\
195 - What are you talking about?\\
196 - Some crazy guy just shoved it of my head and took off.\\
197 - I have no idea what's inside of it!\\
198 - Oh, my God, is this bacon?!\\
199 - That's not mine, I swear!\\
200 - I've been set up!\\
201 - And that is not my pork chop!\\
202 - Oh, my God, the conspiracy goes all the way to the top!\\
203 - What are you doing?\\
204 - Trying to instill in Dewey the values sadly neglected by Mr. Milton Bradley in those cowardly Parker Brothers.\\
205 - I mean, how does kids are supposed to learn about how life really works?\\
206 - Non from that G-rated fairy tale.\\
207 - You can't just play a "Joy In The Circus" card and walk away scot-free.\\
208 - "Found A Tumor?"\\
209 - That takes you to the Chemo Spinner.\\
210 - Oh, come on, Carrie, you've got to get over this vegetarian hang up.\\
211 - You can't honestly tell me those animals were innocent.\\
212 - They were sent to the slaughterhouse for a reason.\\
213 - And if you don't think they're planning some kind of uprising, you're just aluding yourself.\\
214 - Hello?\\
215 - She didn't have an answer to that one, did she?\\
216 - Malcolm, do you know what's going on with Craig?\\
217 - No. Why?\\
218 - He left this bizarre weepy message on the answering machine.\\
219 - I mean, it's more bizarre and weepy than usual.\\
220 - Did something upset him at work?\\
221 - Oh, right.\\
222 - I think they switched from cylindrical-shape ice cream scoopers to the conical ones.\\
223 - He took it really hard.\\
224 - I'm going out to play.\\
225 - Oh, sorry, son, but you are staying in to play.\\
226 - -That's him! -He's the murderer!\\
227 - What?! No!\\
228 - He ate my husband!\\
229 - He deep-fried my parents!\\
230 - Order!\\
231 - Order in my court.\\
232 - Let's behave like animals, people.\\
233 - Your Honor, the defendant is charged with 63,428 counts of murder!\\
234 - What?!\\
235 - Each count is by the slice!\\
236 - It's not my fault you're all so delicious!\\
237 - This isn't fair. Say something.\\
238 - That's not what you said in the hallway.\\
239 - I didn't do anything wrong!\\
240 - Didn't do anything wrong?\\
241 - Your Honor, I'd like to present some evidence.\\
242 - I warn you, these photographs are extremely graphic.\\
243 - What? That's just my breakfast.\\
244 - Is anybody else getting hungry?\\
245 - Your Honor, the defendant obviously shows no remorse for his crimes.\\
246 - I've heard enough.\\
247 - You make me sick to my stomachs.\\
248 - I say he's guilty.\\
249 - How does the jury find?\\
250 - Guilty!\\
251 - That's not fair.\\
252 - They're just following you like sheep.\\
253 - You have been found guilty by a jury of your food.\\
254 - I sentence you to be lightly seared and served with a Cajun peppercorn sauce.\\
255 - Well, Dewey, looks like you pulled another "Debilitating Depression" card.\\
256 - Back to the lockdown ward for you, my friend.\\
257 - Dad, we've been playing all night.\\
258 - Can't we stop?\\
259 - That is exactly what I'm trying to teach you, son.\\
260 - You can't just quit when things get tough.\\
261 - You have to grind it out day after day after day to feed your kids, to pay your mortgage.\\
262 - That's how real life works.\\
263 - Unless, of course, you pull the "Suicide" card.\\
264 - But there's very few of those in the deck.\\
265 - Well, my turn.\\
266 - Oh, morning, Reese.\\
267 - I'm making sausage for breakfast, your favorite.\\
268 - No way!\\
269 - You can't pin that on me!\\
270 - I'm innocent!\\
271 - I'm innocent, you hear!\\
272 - Craig, what are you doing here?\\
273 - Just stopped in to say my good-byes.\\
274 - Good-bye?\\
275 - Yup, quit my job at Lucky Aide,\\
276 - bought a little secondhand Vesper and I'm about to hit the road.\\
277 - What?\\
278 - That's right.\\
279 - I'm going to finally fulfill my dream of eating a Swedish pancake in every IHOP in America.\\
280 - It's only been done twice, you know, and one of those was undocumented.\\
281 - Craig, that's crazy. Why are you doing this?\\
282 - Oh, you know, it's the same old story.\\
283 - Girlfriend crowding me, too many friends jockeying for face time.\\
284 - A man needs his freedom, Lois.\\
285 - What more can I say?\\
286 - Anyways, I won't be able to cover your Friday night shift after all.\\
287 - I know this is all my fault, but maybe this will be good for him.\\
288 - He's made a realistic decision to evaluate his life.\\
289 - How can that be bad?\\
290 - I don't have much money, but I've got my banjo.\\
291 - I figure I'd pay for my meals with songs,\\
292 - the kindness of strangers should take care of the rest.\\
293 - Well, then I guess it's good-bye.\\
294 - You know I've never been really big on the sissy stuff, so I'd better just haul tush.\\
295 - I wasn't going to say anything until he got to the banjo stuff,\\
296 - but he'll be dead before sundown.\\
297 - Mom, I think there's something you should know.\\
298 - Remember last week when you asked Craig to cover for you on the schedule?\\
299 - You ruined his life so you could go see some band?!\\
300 - Are you that selfish?\\
301 - Apparently, because there's a part of me hoping you'll still let me go.\\
302 - Okay, that part's gone.\\
303 - Get in the car! We got to go find him!\\
304 - Reese, I still don't understand what we're doing here.\\
305 - I've worked here all this time and I didn't understand.\\
306 - Understand what?\\
307 - This is a crime against nature.\\
308 - Would you like to be slathered in a delicious sauce and charbroiled to order?\\
309 - I don't think so.\\
310 - Wow, wait up.\\
311 - You're free!\\
312 - You're all free! Go and live your lives!\\
313 - Earn this.\\
314 - You're a hero, Reese! Look at them run!\\
315 - It's beautiful, isn't it?\\
316 - I mean, besides the flies and crap and stuff.\\
317 - Oh, my God! They're heading under the freeway!\\
318 - This is it, the open road.\\
319 - A great new chapter's about to be written,\\
320 - a new legend about to be born.\\
321 - Will I travel from town to town solving crimes like Knightrider,\\
322 - or administer frontier justice like the guy from Kung Fu?\\
323 - I guess we'll just have to see.\\
324 - Okay, America, get ready to meet Craig Feldspar.\\
325 - Craig, wait!\\
326 - Oh, God!\\
327 - Craig, are you all right?!\\
328 - Craig, Craig!\\
329 - Kit, is that you?\\
330 - Just help me back on my hog.\\
331 - I'll be fine.\\
332 - Thanks. I'm good to go.\\
333 - Oh, Craig, don't be ridiculous. You're not going anywhere.\\
334 - Why? Do you need somebody to paint your lawn or mow your house?\\
335 - Look, Craig, Malcolm told me about that.\\
336 - I admit I take you for granted sometimes, I apologize for that,\\
337 - but we can talk about that later.\\
338 - You have to come back.\\
339 - I can't.\\
340 - Why? Craig, come on.\\
341 - Aren't you interested at all to see how my mom punishes me?\\
342 - No.\\
343 - Why not?\\
344 - Because for the last 12 years, I've dedicated my life to a relationship that can't exist.\\
345 - I can't go back to that.\\
346 - Craig, what do you want from me?!\\
347 - I want more!\\
348 - I'm sorry.\\
349 - I can't give you more. You know that.\\
350 - There's got to be something.\\
351 - There's got to be some scenario where you could see us together. Please?!\\
352 - Anything!\\
353 - Okay, this is the only universe this could possibly exist in.\\
354 - I'm 90 years old.\\
355 - Hal is dead.\\
356 - I have dementia and I need someone to keep me from catching myself on fire.\\
357 - There's no money for a nurse, the kids won't do it,\\
358 - and I'm asleep 22 hours a day.\\
359 - Then and only then maybe could we be together.\\
360 - It's like you're reading straight out of my diary.\\
361 - Six, seven, eight.\\
362 - I win!\\
363 - I got to tell you, Dad, I really thought this was just going to be another one of your stupid,\\
364 - useless lessons like the time you made us nurse that rabid squirrel back to health.\\
365 - But this one really worked.\\
366 - I can't believe it, but I really learned some valuable things about...\\
367 - life and about how the world really works.\\
368 - Thank you.\\
369 - That's loser talk!\\
370 - What?\\
371 - I am living in Successful Estates while you are being buried in a piano box!\\
372 - In your face, drug addict!\\
373 - Hotcha! I won!\\
374 - I won! Oh, yes, indeed, I won!\\
375 - I won, I won, I won...
\subsection {Episode 21: Morp}
1 - Man, I hate finals.\\
2 - I was up all night studying.\\
3 - Not me, I slept like a baby.\\
4 - What are you doing?\\
5 - Just making sure I know the answers for my history test today.\\
6 - There's more than one way to be a genius, Malcolm.\\
7 - Malcolm in the Middle 7.21 - "Morp"\\

10 - Hey, Dewey, what have you got there?\\
11 - I have to do an autobiography for my English class,\\
12 - and my teacher wants me to include a few pictures from my early childhood.\\
13 - Well, it looks like you have a lot to choose from.\\
14 - Yeah. You guys really did a great job with Francis...\\
15 - And Reese...\\
16 - And Malcolm.\\
17 - Now why don't we take a look at a few of my precious memories.\\
18 - Spider.\\
19 - There.\\
20 - Now we have that memory.\\
21 - Will you stop feeling sorry for yourself, there must be a hundreds of pictures of you in here.\\
22 - Well, here is poor, neglected Dewey having great time at SeaWorld.\\
23 - It's so blurry, you can't even tell that's me.\\
24 - Well, you can't prove it's not.\\
25 - Dewey, at least we got you a memory book. That's more than we've done for Jamie.\\
26 - And I suppose that makes you feel pretty good about yourselves.\\
27 - You want to know the truth?\\
28 - You were the fourth child.\\
29 - By the time you came along, this house was in a state of complete chaos.\\
30 - The only sleep I got was when I'd nod off on the drive to work.\\
31 - So forgive us if we didn't get a chance to take every picture, every video, or get you every vaccination.\\
32 - -I wasn't vaccinated? -Tell you what, Dewey.\\
33 - You get whooping cough, I promise I'll take a ton of pictures.\\
34 - You won't believe it!\\
35 - I just got asked to the prom by Nick Tompkins!\\
36 - Oh, great, it's prom time already.\\
37 - An evening of posers and phonies out to make the rest of us feel like crap.\\
38 - It's just like every other day of high school, except it costs a thousand dollars.\\
39 - That's inspired.\\
40 - "A Night To Cherish"?\\
41 - It makes last year's "A Night To Remember" seem so shallow.\\
42 - Yeah, I wouldn't expect you to show up, anyway, Carla.\\
43 - You'll probably be home alone in your room,\\
44 - listening to Morrissey and gouging out the eyes of the models in Vogue magazine.\\
45 - Aw, does this mean we're not best friends anymore?\\
46 - That was great.\\
47 - You're Carla, right?\\
48 - The one who read the phone book out loud at the talent show.\\
49 - Yeah. I was surprised they let me get all the way to the B's.\\
50 - You know what sucks about this school?\\
51 - Students, teachers, the textbooks, the asbestos-filled building and the toxic dump it's built on?\\
52 - Well, that, plus they never offer anything for people like us to do.\\
53 - You know what would be cool?\\
54 - If there was a party that was the complete opposite of the prom.\\
55 - You mean like a "morp."\\
56 - What?\\
57 - A morp, the complete opposite of the prom.\\
58 - Morp. I like that.\\
59 - Yeah, instead of paying $500 for a dress, we could just wear jeans and a sweatshirt.\\
60 - And instead of a limo, we can all just take the bus.\\
61 - We should totally do this.\\
62 - -Can I get your number? -Sure.\\
63 - It wasn't me who threw that pudding at you!\\
64 - Well, you should have thought of that before you started looking like the guy who did!\\
65 - Excuse me?\\
66 - You're Reese, aren't you?\\
67 - Wait a second, I'm in the middle of something.\\
68 - Don't worry, somebody will find you, they do drug searches on Fridays.\\
69 - Okay, what?\\
70 - What are you doing prom night?\\
71 - That's a Saturday.\\
72 - I'll be throwing shopping carts into the reservoir.\\
73 - My name is Jeanie.\\
74 - For the past four years, I've been super-focused on keeping a perfect GPA.\\
75 - But now that I've got my acceptance letter from Brown,\\
76 - I feel like I've got some time to experience high school social life.\\
77 - So I want you to take me to the prom.\\
78 - Yeah... that sounds like a fun night, except...\\
79 - the next morning I wake up like an idiot with no shopping carts in the reservoir.\\
80 - I'll pay you $200.\\
81 - Two hundred dollars?!\\
82 - Just to go out on a date?\\
83 - And the career counselor said I should be a mechanic.\\
84 - I can't wait to throw this in his face.\\
85 - Yeah...\\
86 - You're basically a tear down,\\
87 - but I think I can get you ready.\\
88 - Meet me here tomorrow at 3:00.\\
89 - How sweet is this?\\
90 - I think she likes you.\\
91 - You know, I felt pretty bad after our little conversation the other day. So...\\
92 - I did a little poking around the garage myself, and you'll never guess what I found.\\
93 - Dewey's artwork.\\
94 - Kindergarten, first grade.\\
95 - Oh, look, art camp.\\
96 - It's all here.\\
97 - Sorry, Dad, I don't know what to say.\\
98 - Wait a minute, here's a drawing I did of Grandma.\\
99 - And it's beautiful.\\
100 - You did a really nice job with her whiskey bottle.\\
101 - I also have her missing a leg.\\
102 - Interesting, since she didn't lose it until last year.\\
103 - Dewey, if you're trying to tell me that you can predict the future...\\
104 - So you're neglectful, and you think I'm an idiot.\\
105 - That's nice.\\
106 - I spent over an hour on this rainbow, Dewey!\\
107 - You're not an easy boy to love, you know!\\
108 - Thanks for coming to the meeting.\\
109 - This morp of ours is going to blow those prom zombies away.\\
110 - Do we have to call it a meeting?\\
111 - That sounds like something the dance committee would call it.\\
112 - Okay, you're totally right, this isn't a meeting.\\
113 - But I still think that we need to have some sort of plan.\\
114 - Hey, how crazy is this?\\
115 - So you know how everyone wears formal clothes the prom, right?\\
116 - So how about if we all went naked?\\
117 - I'm not sure that's such a good idea.\\
118 - Can we go naked?\\
119 - -No. -Here we go.\\
120 - King Malcolm handing down his rules from the mountaintop.\\
121 - Will there be uniforms?\\
122 - Little flags with your picture on them?\\
123 - A.J., you moron, the can drive was not a fascist conspiracy, and neither is this.\\
124 - Oh, my God.\\
125 - The backbiting, the name-calling... this is just like French club!\\
126 - Exactly. This is turning out like every other school event.\\
127 - We got some weasly tyrant pushing everybody around.\\
128 - The scared masses.\\
129 - A poet willing to speak the truth.\\
130 - I say we should all be free to make our own anti-prom statement.\\
131 - And each choose our own location to do it in.\\
132 - In other words, we all stay home on prom night like we do every year?\\
133 - That'll send a message.\\
134 - Look, guys, the morp is too good of an idea to let personality conflicts get in the way.\\
135 - We have been outsiders that have never belonged to anything.\\
136 - And now, for one night, we can be a part of something.\\
137 - And do it in a way that allows us to all to be individuals.\\
138 - Malcolm's right.\\
139 - Let's make this happen.\\
140 - I have an idea for refreshments.\\
141 - What if we get a big punch bowl, and then we all drink punch.\\
142 - You know, ironically.\\
143 - I guess I could write our manifesto.\\
144 - I've already got the first 1,500 pages.\\
145 - That's great.\\
146 - And I'll arrange for us to use the boiler room in the basement.\\
147 - The only problem is, it's full of desks. We'll have to move all those out.\\
148 - Who's got Friday night open?\\
149 - Let's review the evening.\\
150 - What time do you pick me up?\\
151 - I ring your doorbell at 6:00.\\
152 - I'm prompt because it's a sign of respect.\\
153 - And when you get to my house...\\
154 - I know.\\
155 - No throwing eggs at the door.\\
156 - Also a sign of respect.\\
157 - And when we're at the dance, and it's time to say something nice,\\
158 - what do you say?\\
159 - I don't know, "Thanks for shaving?"\\
160 - -We went over this! -Right, right, right.\\
161 - "Every time I look at you you somehow become more beautiful."\\
162 - His teeth are done.\\
163 - They're not white enough.\\
164 - Don't you people realize that we're running out of time here?\\
165 - Look at this.\\
166 - He's not even close.\\
167 - I want his face flawless, his hair shorter and shinier.\\
168 - He's an illiterate thug.\\
169 - I don't think it's too much to ask that he looks perfect!\\
170 - You heard the lady.\\
171 - Make me glow.\\
172 - Lois, I don't want to alarm you, but there is a naked man in your house!\\
173 - What took you so long?\\
174 - The boys left for the prom a half hour ago.\\
175 - Yeah, I know, I got a flat tire on my way to Jamie's babysitter.\\
176 - I had to drive back on the rim.\\
177 - There were a lot of sparks, but I don't think anything caught fire.\\
178 - The main thing is that you and I have...\\
179 - Dewey!\\
180 - What are you doing here?\\
181 - I live here.\\
182 - Honey, Dewey's here!\\
183 - What's he doing here?\\
184 - Don't you have a prom to go to?\\
185 - I'm not in high school.\\
186 - He says he's not in high school!\\
187 - Oh, for God sakes, Hal, we're just going to have to take a raincheck.\\
188 - No!\\
189 - Okay, look, I'm very sorry, but you got to get out of here.\\
190 - What?\\
191 - But I'm researching a history report on-ine.\\
192 - If it's money you want, you got it.\\
193 - Here, you ought to be able to have a good time with that.\\
194 - You can go to a movie, grab a burger.\\
195 - Hey, the Hyatt has a piano bar.\\
196 - -But I don't have any shoes. -Buy some!\\
197 - I love you, son.\\
198 - Listen, maybe we'll go to the zoo sometime, huh? Just you and me!\\
199 - Wow. Quite a turnout.\\
200 - Yeah.\\
201 - We even got three home-schooled kids.\\
202 - Here, Carla, hey, Malcolm.\\
203 - Have some punch.\\
204 - There's nothing in there.\\
205 - I know.\\
206 - It's a statement about how completely empty the real prom experience is.\\
207 - The cookies are just cookies.\\
208 - I love your wrist corsage.\\
209 - Yeah. I found it in the crisper drawer.\\
210 - Good job, guys.\\
211 - This sucks the least of anything I've ever done in my life.\\
212 - I met a guy here who hates Starbucks more than I do.\\
213 - This is fantastic, Malcolm.\\
214 - All these people would have been home tonight feeling lonely and miserable.\\
215 - You should feel really proud.\\
216 - Yeah, I guess.\\
217 - What do you mean "you guess"?\\
218 - I know, I know, it just...\\
219 - I thought it would feel better.\\
220 - There's something missing.\\
221 - I didn't see the schedule of events.\\
222 - What time is everyone going to nude up?\\
223 - I just have to come out and say it.\\
224 - I was incredible, and you were no slouch yourself.\\
225 - I'm the lucky one, Hal. All I had to do was show up.\\
226 - Did you hear the phone ring?\\
227 - Hal, I couldn't have heard the space shuttle land.\\
228 - Hi. This is Dewey. Remember me?\\
229 - Your fourth son?\\
230 - Nah, I don't expect you to miss me,\\
231 - but at some point, Dad, you may miss the wallet you threw at me,\\
232 - You gave him your wallet?!\\
233 - So here's the deal: If you'd like to see all your money and credit cards again...\\
234 - Wait a minute.\\
235 - That bell ringing in the background.\\
236 - I know I've heard that before!\\
237 - So here's the deal: If you'd like to see all your...\\
238 - That is Saint Matthew's.\\
239 - No, wait.\\
240 - Saint Luke's on Third.\\
241 - It's definitely a Lutheran bell.\\
242 - If you'd like to see your all your money and credit cards again, meet me where they're building the new library,\\
243 - at the corner of Washington and Olive.\\
244 - Ah! That's it!\\
245 - Dinner and the limo were fantastic,\\
246 - and your parents were delightful.\\
247 - You didn't tell me that they were Asian, too.\\
248 - Here come Mike and Anna.\\
249 - Just smile and don't be yourself.\\
250 - Hi, Jeanie.\\
251 - Is that Reese?\\
252 - Hello, it is such a pleasure to see you.\\
253 - So you've met.\\
254 - Yeah, he steals my lunch every day and throws me in a garbage can.\\
255 - Your mother makes a marvelous tuna fish sandwich.\\
256 - Give her my best, will you?\\
257 - I've never seen Reese so...\\
258 - un-psycho-like before.\\
259 - How could I be anything but a perfect gentleman around someone as breathtaking as Jeanie?\\
260 - -Bye. See ya. -See ya.\\
261 - Reese, that wasn't in the script.\\
262 - I'm sorry. Are you going to spray me again?\\
263 - No, it was actually really nice.\\
264 - I liked it.\\
265 - Would you like to have this dance with me?\\
266 - I'd be delighted.\\
267 - You can go ahead and grab my butt.\\
268 - You're paying for it.\\
269 - Now, remember, we only have to be nice to him until he gets close enough to the van to grab him.\\
270 - Do you folks have a young boy you don't care about?\\
271 - What?\\
272 - He wanted me to give you this.\\
273 - You see the way Dewey's throwing around my money?\\
274 - He has minions!\\
275 - Oh, well, at least he returned my HMO card.\\
276 - "If you want another..." Oh, great! If I want another piece of my wallet,\\
277 - we have to meet him at the corner of Temple and Fourth,\\
278 - "Wear what's in the bag."\\
279 - Oh! Will you look at this?\\
280 - It's bad enough we have to traipse all over town looking for him, now we have to dress up?!\\
281 - How's he even gonna know if we're wearing this?\\
282 - I'll tell you how.\\
283 - The little monster has a camera in here.\\
284 - If you think you're going to make a fool out of me, I've got news for you, little man:\\
285 - It's not going to happen!\\
286 - Malcolm, I don't understand this.\\
287 - The morp is going great downstairs. Why do we have to come up here?\\
288 - It finally hit me:\\
289 - These people have to know that we're having a good time without them.\\
290 - Why do you care what they think?\\
291 - I don't care, but I want them to know I don't care.\\
292 - Perfect.\\
293 - Hey, Malcolm.\\
294 - Isn't this a great party?\\
295 - Open your eyes, Reese. Everything about this night is completely phony.\\
296 - Maybe it is phony, but maybe something that starts out as phony can turn into something real.\\
297 - You may call this corny, Malcolm,\\
298 - but this really is a night to cherish.\\
299 - Reese...\\
300 - Sorry, Steve, official prom business.\\
301 - Can I have your attention, everybody?\\
302 - I just thought you people should know\\
303 - that while you're up here enjoying what you have deluded yourselves into thinking is the greatest night of your lives,\\
304 - the people who you've excluded from this charade are downstairs right now,\\
305 - having a party that obliterates yours.\\
306 - You think you're on the inside, but you're on the outside.\\
307 - How does that make you feel?\\
308 - *I feel good*\\
309 - *I knew that I would know*\\
310 - *I feel good*\\
311 - *I knew that I would know*\\
312 - *So good*\\
313 - *So good*\\
314 - *I got you*\\
315 - This is our fifth stop, Hal.\\
316 - Is this gonna go on all night?\\
317 - Well, he's certainly dragging it out.\\
318 - So far, all he's given me back from my wallet is crap!\\
319 - I got my library card, my organ donor card...\\
320 - Oh, wait, he did give me back my tip chart.\\
321 - God knows how much of your money he's spent on presents and party supplies.\\
322 - So Dewey wants a party?\\
323 - You hold him down, I'll give him a party!\\
324 - -Can I help you? -Oh, uh...\\
325 - Yes, uh...\\
326 - "I'm Dewey's jackass father."\\
327 - -The sex maniacs are here! -Cool!\\
328 - If you can keep your hands off your wife long enough, pull up to the window.\\
329 - You guys were so much hotter in my mind when Dewey told me the story.\\
330 - Just give us our stuff.\\
331 - Here you go.\\
332 - Ah, my driver's license.\\
333 - We're getting closer.\\
334 - Look at that.\\
335 - He drew a mustache on you.\\
336 - No, I did that.\\
337 - I wanted to see how it looked.\\
338 - -Punch? -No, thanks.\\
339 - Look, I know that was embarrassing, but all those people up there think you're a creep, anyway, so nothing lost.\\
340 - I guess.\\
341 - Oh, my God!\\
342 - So there really is a party going on down here.\\
343 - Look, we're having a great time.\\
344 - We're just enjoying just being with each other.\\
345 - Yeah, but this place is so dark and creepy.\\
346 - Didn't the janitor kill someone down here a few years ago?\\
347 - Okay, you've come down to see the freak show. You've had your fun.\\
348 - Why don't you leave us alone?\\
349 - You know what?\\
350 - You guys should just come upstairs.\\
351 - What?\\
352 - Yeah, there's only a month left of school, and all this stuff about who's cool and who's not, I mean, it's just kind of silly, isn't it?\\
353 - Oh, really?\\
354 - Was it silly in fourth grade, when I was the only kid on our street you didn't invite to your birthday party?\\
355 - I sent you an invitation.\\
356 - -You stood me up. -No, I didn't.\\
357 - I would have loved to have gone.\\
358 - -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God.\\
359 - What are you doing?\\
360 - Suddenly a hug solves everything?\\
361 - Come on, guys, let's go to the prom.\\
362 - Carla?\\
363 - Heather?\\
364 - This isn't the way I thought it would happen,\\
365 - but I just got asked to the prom!\\
366 - A.J., you can't be serious.\\
367 - Hey, it took guts for those girls to come down here and apologize.\\
368 - And I'd like to think I'm big enough to be able to admit I'd like to have sex with one of them.\\
369 - You can't just let them say "I'm sorry" after 12 years of treating us like crap!\\
370 - Wait a minute, they never even said "sorry!"\\
371 - This is a trap!\\
372 - These are the same people who made fun of your clothes all through school,\\
373 - and laughed at your haircuts, and called you Malcolm-Balcolm!\\
374 - You'll be sorry!\\
375 - Finally.\\
376 - Now we've got some breathing room in here.\\
377 - *She doesn't wait for me*\\
378 - *And now that she's gone*\\
379 - *I feel that she'll never be*\\
380 - *Back in my arms* -You're a really good dancer.\\
381 - When I'm with you, it doesn't even feel like we're dancing.\\
382 - It's like we're floating.\\
383 - I misjudged you, Reese.\\
384 - I just chose you because you weren't completely hideous, and I knew you wouldn't have a date.\\
385 - But you're so much more than that.\\
386 - You've made me feel wonderful.\\
387 - It's been a really great night for me, too.\\
388 - You helped me find a little part of me that I didn't even know was there,\\
389 - the part that isn't a gigantic jackass.\\
390 - You know...\\
391 - I wasn't planning on the night ending this way,\\
392 - but why don't we get out of here,\\
393 - grab a blanket and a bottle of wine and go to the beach.\\
394 - -You mean it? -Yes, Reese.\\
395 - I really want you.\\
396 - It's 12:00 already?\\
397 - Too bad, I was having fun.\\
398 - Well, see you at school.\\
399 - Reese, where are you going?\\
400 - It's midnight. I'm off the clock.\\
401 - But what about us?\\
402 - And all those things you said?\\
403 - Well, if I want to make a career out of this, I've gotta satisfy my customers.\\
404 - And I think I did.\\
405 - Tell your friends.\\
406 - Why do we have to haul all this stuff in here when we have no intention of giving him a party?\\
407 - We have to humor him until he reveals himself. This has got to be the place.\\
408 - There you are!\\
409 - You are in so much trouble, young man!\\
410 - I want my wallet now.\\
411 - Here.\\
412 - At least we got here before you spent all my cash.\\
413 - It cost so much to keep this place open after hours,\\
414 - I had to put that on your credit card.\\
415 - Okay, Mr. smart guy.\\
416 - Now you can help us load all this stuff back in the car.\\
417 - I know you think you're having a party, but you can forget about it.\\
418 - This isn't for me.\\
419 - It's too late for my childhood, but it's not too late for his.\\
420 - Jamie?\\
421 - Here's a camera.\\
422 - So now you have no excuse for not documenting every important event in Jamie's life.\\
423 - Starting tonight with his party.\\
424 - This is a really nice camera. How could you afford...?\\
425 - Right.\\
426 - Here, sweetie.\\
427 - Let's go have some cake.\\
428 - That was a good thing you did, son.\\
429 - Thanks.\\
430 - Enjoy the cake.\\
431 - That's the last thing you're going to eat in a long time that hasn't been dipped in sardine juice.\\
432 - Hey! Finally!\\
433 - A picture for your memory book.

19 - Those thieving Harvard bastards!\\
20 - Well, well, well...\\
21 - Mr. Knows How To Multiply is freaking out about his future\\
22 - while I am set for life.\\
23 - Reese, don't you think it's even a little bit sad to become a janitor at your own high school?\\
24 - Assistant janitor. All mop and no paperwork.\\
25 - Okay, I've packed all your winter clothes,\\
26 - your comic books and half your knickknacks.\\
27 - Guess what.\\
28 - We have the same Quiet Riot CD, roomie.\\
29 - Stop calling me that.\\
30 - I'm not your roommate for another two weeks.\\
31 - 12 days!\\
32 - The second you graduate, you are out of this house and into his.\\
33 - What other jobs can you get?\\
34 - I've already got three shifts in the cafeteria,\\
35 - Monday and Wednesday at the bookstore\\
36 - and mopping the dorms at night.\\
37 - I don't know, I guess I could chop vegetables during chem lab.\\
38 - This is outrageous!\\
39 - Kids with half your brains are getting full rides!\\
40 - They didn't correct their interviewer on his pronunciation of "Sarte."\\
41 - Sartre.\\
42 - I don't care.\\
43 - We will find the money somehow.\\
44 - This is as good a time as any to talk about it.\\
45 - I do have a private life.\\
46 - I'll keep it confined to my own room,\\
47 - but you should probably know my safe word.\\
48 - It's weird to think about.\\
49 - Pretty soon you guys will be gone.\\
50 - Yeah.\\
51 - And this...\\
52 - just sitting around hanging out...\\
53 - We're not going to have many more of these.\\
54 - No, we sure won't.\\
55 - Seems like only yesterday you and I were going to homecoming,\\
56 - putting the school paper to bed, fretting over our first big date with Sharon Hines.\\
57 - That kiss went on forever.\\
58 - Uh, Mr. Kenarban, Stevie's supposed to help me work on my speech.\\
59 - Right, right.\\
60 - Mr. Valedictorian.\\
61 - Congratulations again.\\
62 - I'm glad my son can help you out with your big, important speech.\\
63 - It's probably that selflessness that got him the second spot.\\
64 - Dad!\\
65 - I'm not insulting salutatorian. It's...\\
66 - It's quite an honor.\\
67 - I'm just glad that even after I got Cedric Hampton to be the school's commencement speaker,\\
68 - they still had the integrity to make you valedictorian and not my crippled son.\\
69 - Go!\\
70 - I wonder if moving out and being on my own is going to change me?\\
71 - Do you think I'll get a British accent?\\
72 - Absolutely.\\
73 - Hey, wait.\\
74 - You know what us moving out means.\\
75 - What?\\
76 - We can get rid of the nuclear option.\\
77 - -Oh, my God. -You're right.\\
78 - What's the... nuclear option?\\
79 - Evidence of the worst thing we ever did.\\
80 - This is what made sure that no matter how bad we screwed each other over,\\
81 - there was always a limit.\\
82 - None of us could push anyone to a point where they had nothing to lose.\\
83 - Or they'd just pull the trigger and destroy all of us.\\
84 - How bad... can it be?\\
85 - One time we made Mom think... she had cancer.\\
86 - But we had a really good reason.\\
87 - Stop saying it'll be all right!\\
88 - You'll never be able to raise them alone!\\
89 - Mom, I know this is a bad time, but...\\
90 - can you sign these report cards?\\
91 - It's not like we're proud of it.\\
92 - I mean, we were proud of it, but we're not proud of it now.\\
93 - The point is, we can get rid of it.\\
94 - Dewey, I think you should do this.\\
95 - Really?\\
96 - Me?\\
97 - You're going to be the oldest around here soon.\\
98 - It'll be good for your maturity.\\
99 - This is your show.\\
100 - Make us proud.\\
101 - I always pictured this day coming, except both of you were dead.\\
102 - What the heck, it still feels great.\\
103 - Listen, I am begging you.\\
104 - I just need $5,000.\\
105 - You think I would be calling you if I wasn't desperate?\\
106 - Look, I know how much you hate me, but...\\
107 - No kidding, I'm at rock bottom.\\
108 - I've got no money, no prospects and nowhere else to turn.\\
109 - Well...\\
110 - Can I speak to a senior loan officer?\\
111 - So, 3:15 you make the last round of the bathrooms.\\
112 - Toilet 12 is a bit of a diva.\\
113 - Then you rinse your mop in hot water and disinfectant, and you hang it on a yellow peg.\\
114 - Any questions?\\
115 - Yeah. Why would you ever go home?\\
116 - This job is better than I could ever imagine.\\
117 - A cool uniform,\\
118 - the power to cordon off wet floors.\\
119 - You're not just some creepy loner hanging around the school.\\
120 - You're the janitor!\\
121 - Don't get too excited, kid.\\
122 - You'll be gone after 30 days.\\
123 - Oh, no, I am really committed to this.\\
124 - No, no, no, you don't understand.\\
125 - This is a union gig.\\
126 - Once you get past the 30-day probation, you're locked for life.\\
127 - Full benefits, medical, everything.\\
128 - So they never keep a new guy for more than a month.\\
129 - Hey, I'm sorry, kid.\\
130 - You really seem to be a natural at this.\\
131 - I've never seen anybody take to garbage the way you do.\\
132 - There's got to be some way.\\
133 - I mean... I mean, what if there was a mess...\\
134 - a mess that was so big and sticky and disgusting,\\
135 - that it was impossible to clean up in less than 30 days?\\
136 - It's a beautiful thought, kid.\\
137 - But there's no such thing as a 30-day mess.\\
138 - Yeah?\\
139 - Well, they also said they'd never put a man on Mars.\\
140 - Sorry we're late.\\
141 - You wouldn't believe the fight we got in over shower curtains.\\
142 - Those dolphins were gay.\\
143 - You think all dolphins are gay.\\
144 - All dolphins are gay.\\
145 - Dolphins can kill sharks.\\
146 - Gay guys can kill sharks, and they're still gay.\\
147 - Can we begin?\\
148 - With this fire, a terrible secret that bound us together is gone forever.\\
149 - Jamie will grow up in a world without the fear that haunted every second of our lives.\\
150 - He'll learn to give birthday presents out of love, not blackmail,\\
151 - and to share out of the generosity of his heart, not the dread in the pit of his stomach.\\
152 - With this fire, a curse is lifted and a brilliant new dawn is born.\\
153 - -Amen. -Amen.\\
154 - Nice touch.\\
155 - You know, if you want me to take a look at your valedictory speech, I'd be happy to.\\
156 - Mom, stop it.\\
157 - I don't want anyone to see it until it's ready.\\
158 - Fine.\\
159 - But if you ever want some fresh ears...\\
160 - No, I'm really happy with it. Just let me do this.\\
161 - Okay, okay.\\
162 - But why are you quoting a rap group when there are people\\
163 - like Paul McCartney out there who are just as relevant\\
164 - and don't go around showing off the tops of their underpants?\\
165 - It's a start.\\
166 - Susan, I'm sorry.\\
167 - Mom just bullied me into giving her our last ticket for graduation.\\
168 - Because the last time I stood up to her someone dumped a pig's head down our chimney.\\
169 - Besides, she's already on her way.\\
170 - She's driving down with Francis and Piama.\\
171 - Lois, I really think he's going to do it this time! You've got to stop him!\\
172 - There you are.\\
173 - I drove by 80 miles of blunt objects just to get to you.\\
174 - I hope you run!\\
175 - You better make that first swing count, Princess.\\
176 - Hi, Mom.\\
177 - Finish your cigarette and I'll make you some lunch.\\
178 - Come on, you can help me make your beds.\\
179 - I don't know why those two can't get along...\\
180 - You had to make a speech first, didn't you?\\
181 - Hal...\\
182 - Right.\\
183 - Son, don't feel bad.\\
184 - In some parallel universe, you did it.\\
185 - Oh, no.\\
186 - They canceled my Pierson Grant.\\
187 - That was $3,000!\\
188 - They're using the money to do a study on what happens to kids who can't afford college.\\
189 - They're offering me 50 dollars to be a part of it.\\
190 - Show it to me.\\
191 - It's beautiful, Grandma.\\
192 - I just cracked the lid a quarter inch and it burned off all the hair in my nose.\\
193 - Good. Who takes the fall?\\
194 - Huh?\\
195 - Your patsy... who is your patsy?\\
196 - It's a good thing you called me.\\
197 - If you're going to make this big mess, they're going to blame someone.\\
198 - And you can make it anyone you want.\\
199 - A teacher, a neighbor.\\
200 - If you're lucky, a whole family goes down.\\
201 - And you get to sell their dog.\\
202 - You are amazing.\\
203 - If you ever brushed your teeth, I would kiss you.\\
204 - You want 8,000 dollars?\\
205 - Yes.\\
206 - All right, the way this works is you come back next week...\\
207 - That won't be necessary.\\
208 - I'm not going to pay you back.\\
209 - Hear me out.\\
210 - There's no way I can get the money to pay you,\\
211 - but instead of making you go through that whole, stupid charade where you keep calling me\\
212 - and I keep making lame excuses until you hunt me down,\\
213 - I am willing to go straight to the leg-breaking.\\
214 - Really?\\
215 - Yes.\\
216 - Whenever you say, I just show up and you start snapping bones.\\
217 - Arms, legs, whatever.\\
218 - Invite anyone you want.\\
219 - I promise, I will scream and cry and beg for mercy,\\
220 - and make it so loud and so horrible that no one who sees it will ever miss another payment again.\\
221 - Now, you can't buy that kind of publicity.\\
222 - Couldn't I just not give you the money and still break your arms and legs?\\
223 - Wouldn't that accomplish the same thing?\\
224 - True. But...\\
225 - Then I think your point starts to get muddled.\\
226 - Maybe we should sleep on it.\\
227 - Will you straighten up those magazines?\\
228 - The Kenarbans will be here any minute and I don't want their fancy friend to think he's visiting a hobo camp.\\
229 - Yeah, Mom, let's all jump through hoops so the big corporate fat cat doesn't have to see anything real.\\
230 - You know, Francis, it wouldn't hurt you to jump through a hoop or two.\\
231 - Are you even still looking for a job?\\
232 - As a matter of fact...\\
233 - As a matter of fact, I don't have to.\\
234 - I got a lot of irons in the fire right now. I got three different ideas for children's books,\\
235 - and I'm considering applying for a bounty hunter's license.\\
236 - Are you insane?!\\
237 - In what world is that even remotel...?\\
238 - Piama, will you help me get the good china on the closet ?\\
239 - I love finally having an excuse to use these.\\
240 - I took them out once when that congressman was going door to door but,\\
241 - he just clogged up our toilet and left.\\
242 - By the way, Mom, I think it's high time we cleared the air about that day\\
243 - you threw away my Harlem Globetrotter autographs.\\
244 - Harlem who? What are you talking about?\\
245 - I'm not saying there was definitely some unconscious racism going on,\\
246 - but I do think someone could benefit from a little self-examination in a quiet moment.\\
247 - Dewey, can I see you in your room for a second?\\
248 - Okay, it's pretty obvious I just saved your ass.\\
249 - Now I want to know why.\\
250 - So, right when we walk in, I fake a seizure.\\
251 - When I fall, I make sure my skirt comes up over my hips.\\
252 - I'm going commando, so you'll have plenty of time to sneak this out of the car.\\
253 - I love you, Grandma.\\
254 - You're a good boy.\\
255 - Are you kidding me? That whole cancer scare was fake?!\\
256 - I played cards with her in the hospital for no reason?\\
257 - Why didn't you just get rid of this?\\
258 - I don't know.\\
259 - I couldn't.\\
260 - The thought of destroying it just made me... sad.\\
261 - I get it, Dewey.\\
262 - You love your brothers.\\
263 - You didn't have much to keep you together, but you had this.\\
264 - And now I have this.\\
265 - Something really horrible to blackmail you guys with that I'm totally clean on.\\
266 - Mom's friend Jenny.\\
267 - We're good.\\
268 - So Mr. Hampton,\\
269 - You got all the subroutines, the GUI, all of that into 16K?\\
270 - I can't get a Boolean sort in that.\\
271 - You youngsters are spoiled by all that cheap RAM.\\
272 - When I started out, I had an 8-bit bus that ran at 4.7 megahertz, and I was happy to have it.\\
273 - This is fantastic.\\
274 - I haven't understood a word you've said for the last ten minutes.\\
275 - Oh, you don't have to be that impressed.\\
276 - Sure, now he owns a GulfStream jet and a baseball team,\\
277 - but there was a time when this guy's name was Accident Pants.\\
278 - Remember that?\\
279 - Remember that?\\
280 - I remember somebody begging me for a loan.\\
281 - Remember that?\\
282 - Remember that?\\
283 - Now, listen, I'm really not here to socialize.\\
284 - I've seen some of the programming you boys have done.\\
285 - The server-to-server algorithm. The evolution simulator, that's all good stuff.\\
286 - He thinks...\\
287 - we're geniuses.\\
288 - Well, good enough for a two-year contract, anyway.\\
289 - Full benefits, stock options.\\
290 - We're talking six figures-- each.\\
291 - Oh, my God!\\
292 - Wait, how many is six?\\
293 - I'm not being charitable.\\
294 - I'm locking you in while you're still cheap, but I need an answer right now.\\
295 - Otherwise it's not worth it to me.\\
296 - Well, I...\\
297 - That's a very generous offer, Mr. Hampton, but no.\\
298 - Mom, what are you...?\\
299 - Malcolm's going to college, he's going to finish his education.\\
300 - But thank you very much.\\
301 - He wasn't asking you, he was...\\
302 - Ma'am, I completely understand.\\
303 - I should have talked to you first.\\
304 - Consider the offer withdrawn.\\
305 - Sorry, kid. 24/seven job. You'd need your whole family behind you.\\
306 - And don't be mad at your mom. She's only trying to look out for you.\\
307 - Who knows how far I would've gone if I went to college?\\
308 - What's that noise?\\
309 - Nothing, Dad. Just a little hungry.\\
310 - All right, Malcolm, I know you're angry.\\
311 - You might as well say what you have to now and get it out of your system.\\
312 - Oh, my eyes!\\
313 - I'm so sorry, Jamie.\\
314 - I didn't know I had you hanging upside down until that last layer of gunk came off.\\
315 - Well, we might as well go ahead and have kids.\\
316 - I'm not afraid of changing diapers anymore.\\
317 - Good job, Reese.\\
318 - Hey, I am the victim here!\\
319 - Those are my hopes and dreams you're scrubbing out of your cracks!\\
320 - Anybody else hungry?\\
321 - Oh, mother...\\
322 - You know what?\\
323 - I'm glad!\\
324 - This is appropriate.\\
325 - Now my life looks exactly how I feel.\\
326 - How could you screw me over like that?\\
327 - Because you were going to take that job,\\
328 - and we are not going to let you throw your life away.\\
329 - How is being rich throwing my life away?!\\
330 - Because it's not the life you're supposed to have!\\
331 - The life you're supposed to have is you go to Harvard,\\
332 - and you earn every fellowship and internship they have.\\
333 - You graduate first in your class, and you start working in public service,\\
334 - either district attorney or running some foundation,\\
335 - and then you become governor of a mid-sized state,\\
336 - and then you become president.\\
337 - What?!\\
338 - Of the United States.\\
339 - Dad?\\
340 - I'm sorry, son. It's true.\\
341 - I thought you knew.\\
342 - Our expectations started out much smaller, but you just kept upping the ante.\\
343 - What if I don't want to be president?\\
344 - It's too late that. You're gonna do it.\\
345 - Oh, really?\\
346 - Have you decided my position on capital-gains tax cuts?\\
347 - What are my foreign policy objectives?!\\
348 - That doesn't matter.\\
349 - What does matter is you'll be the only person in that position who will ever give a crap about people like us.\\
350 - We've been getting the short end of the stick for thousands of years, and I, for one, am sick of it.\\
351 - Now, you are going to be president, mister, and that's the end of it.\\
352 - Did it ever occured to you that I could have taken this job,\\
353 - gotten really rich and then bought my way into being president?\\
354 - Of course it did.\\
355 - We decided against it.\\
356 - What?!\\
357 - Because then you wouldn't be a good president.\\
358 - You wouldn't have suffered enough.\\
359 - I've been suffering all my life.\\
360 - I'm sorry, it's not enough.\\
361 - You know what it's like to be poor, and you know what it's like to work hard.\\
362 - Now you're going to learn what it's like to sweep floors and\\
363 - bust your ass and accomplish twice as much as all the kids around you.\\
364 - And it won't mean anything because they will still look down on you.\\
365 - And you will want so much for them to like you, and they just won't.\\
366 - And it'll break your heart.\\
367 - And that'll make your heart bigger and open your eyes and finally you will realize\\
368 - that there's more to life than proving you're the smartest person in the world.\\
369 - I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path.\\
370 - You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.\\
371 - That's Dewey.\\
372 - Really?\\
373 - This is unbelievable.\\
374 - You actually expect me to be president.\\
375 - No, no, I'm sorry.\\
376 - You expect me to be one of the greatest presidents in the history of the United States.\\
377 - You look me in the eye and you tell me you can't do it.\\
378 - And as the Dalai Lama eloquently stated last summer on my yacht,\\
379 - "Wisdom is the light by day,\\
380 - vertue is the protection by night\\
381 - And as we go down the path of life, there's often confusion and fear,\\
382 - because we fail to remember that we have this Wisdom within us.\\
383 - It's there to call on,\\
384 - to get us through the dark night of the soul,\\
385 - to help us achieve a new dawn with new possibilities...\\
386 - AmeriSys Industries?\\
387 - What's that?\\
388 - Shh!\\
389 - It's my employee badge.\\
390 - Please don't tell Mom, it'd make her too happy.\\
391 - She'd never let me live it down.\\
392 - You got a job?\\
393 - For the last two months.\\
394 - It's at this giant corporation.\\
395 - I'm in this tiny little cubicle, surrounded by hundreds of other tiny little cubicles,\\
396 - inputting numbers into a computer all day.\\
397 - And I love it.\\
398 - I love everything about it.\\
399 - I love the stability and the regular paychecks.\\
400 - I love my parking space.\\
401 - I love getting those stupid joke e-mails.\\
402 - Oh, did you get the one about the two Irish guys?\\
403 - That's a classic!\\
404 - And now with the valedictory speech,\\
405 - please welcome Malcolm...\\
406 - Like all of you, I'm praying for this speech to be over soon.\\
407 - Most of us have been dreaming of this day for years,\\
408 - the day we leave childhood and achieve independance.\\
409 - But even if we move thousands of miles away,\\
410 - there's no escape.\\
411 - Our families are coming with us.\\
412 - They'll be with us forever.\\
413 - In our habits, our gestures, and in the choices we make.\\
414 - So we'll never be set-free,\\
415 - we'll never be alone.\\
416 - As Paul McCartney once said...\\
417 - THREE MONTHS LATER\\
418 - Oh, my God!\\
419 - What kind of monster would do something like this?\\
420 - Oh, Hal, for God's sake, don't touch it!\\
421 - Man, if Mom ever found out it was the two of us...\\
422 - Hey...\\
423 - The five-settings heating pad!\\
424 - You listen to me, you really do!\\
425 - Someone's cake is ready.\\
426 - Mom, you can yell and scream all you want. It's not going to change me!\\
427 - I will look for a job when I am damn good and ready!\\
428 - You just can't stand that your son is still a free spirit!\\
429 - Chicken casserole for dinner?\\
430 - Mmm. Home at 5:00.\\
431 - This is so nice.\\
432 - Reese is gone. Malcolm's off to Harvard.\\
433 - I don't know how you did it, but everything worked out exactly as planned.\\
434 - What's wrong?\\
435 - And when they found the peepholes in the bathroom,\\
436 - they fired Al and brought me on full time.\\
437 - Grandma's right, it's good to have a patsy.\\
438 - So how's it going with you, Mr. Ivy League Big Shot?\\
439 - It's great.\\
440 - It's a whole new world.\\
441 - Listen, I've got to get to my Calc class. I'll talk to you later.
