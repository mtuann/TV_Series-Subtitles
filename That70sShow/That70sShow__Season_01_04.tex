a poodle's ass.\\
43 - Boy, just when you think
you've seen everything...\\
44 - A poodle's ass
walks into your party.\\

66 - I found it just sitting...\\
67 - You know...\\
68 - Around.\\
69 - Well, put 'em away, son.\\
70 - Why, I intend to, sir.\\
71 - Oh, honey, honey, on
your way to the basement,\\
72 - could you pop these
in the fridge?\\
73 - They're warm.\\
74 - Ha ha ha ha!\\
75 - Check it out.\\
76 - I see that every day.\\
77 - He's alive!\\
78 - Good news.\\
79 - My dad...\\
80 - Is thinking of giving me...\\
81 - The vista cruiser.\\
82 - You're getting a car?\\
83 - Ooh. Have I told you how
incredibly attractive you are, Eric?\\
84 - No.\\
85 - Michael: You told me
he was cute.\\
86 - No, I didn't.\\
87 - I remember, 'cause you said\\
88 - not to say anything
in front of Eric.\\

important here, people.\\

100 - but talk to you\\
101 - whoa, yeah\\
102 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
103 - Wow, marcia. A
football in the face.\\
104 - That's gotta hurt.\\
105 - Ouch!
My nose!\\
106 - That's gonna be
huge in the morning.\\
107 - Huger than my boobs?\\
108 - Well, bigger than the left one.\\
109 - Why are we watching this
without the sound?\\
110 - I am totally confused.\\
111 - Here.
Use the earphone.\\
112 - So...\\
113 - What's the deal
with the vista cruiser?\\
114 - The deal is,

132 - Well, i'm getting a soda.\\
133 - Yep. Me, too.\\
134 - Sit down.\\
135 - You don't want me to go
to the concert. Is that it?\\
136 - I didn't know
if you liked music.\\
137 - Michael!\\
138 - I didn't invite you
to the concert\\
139 - because I know you
really don't like my friends.\\
140 - Did you tell them that?\\
141 - No.\\
142 - Michael, don't tell
our private conversations\\
143 - to other people, Michael.\\
144 - We have to have our own
private conversations.\\
145 - Also, I didn't think you'd be
interested in Todd rundgren.\\
146 - Like you said, he's no frampton.\\
147 - I love Todd rundgren.\\
148 - I have the 45 of hello, it's me.\\
149 - Remember the night
we listened to it?\\
150 - We can have fun at the concert,\\
151 - especially in the car
on the way back.\\
152 - Ok, you can go.\\
153 - Only if you want me to.\\
154 - Oh, I want you to.\\
155 - Jackie...\\
156 - I guess you're going
to the concert with US.\\
157 - Yeah!\\
158 - Mm-hmm.
I can't wait.\\
159 - So, Michael,\\
160 - you want to go back to my house\\
161 - and listen to
Todd rundgren records?\\
162 - Yeah. Sure.\\
163 - Ok. Bye.\\
164 - You kids have fun!
Bye!\\
165 - Bye-bye now!\\
166 - Oh, they're so darn cute.\\
167 - The minute you turn your back,\\
168 - they go at it like dogs.\\
169 - Ooh, they're frisky.\\
170 - You can't leave them alone.\\
171 - No.\\
172 - You know...\\
173 - My sister thinks that we...\\
174 - Shouldn't be left alone.\\
175 - US?\\
176 - Yes.\\
177 - We're alone now.\\
178 - Well...\\
179 - Yeah.\\
180 - Eric...\\
181 - Relax.\\
182 - We've lived next door
to each other forever.\\
183 - You could have had me
when I was 4.\\
184 - Really?\\
185 - And there I was all day
long on the hippity-hop.\\
186 - Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!\\
187 - Stupid!\\
188 - Stupid.\\
189 - Ever since yesterday,\\
190 - I can't stop thinking about you.\\
191 - I mean,\\
192 - I've known you
practically my whole life.\\
193 - I want you.\\
194 - I want you so bad.\\
195 - Eric, it's a car.\\
196 - Let's just leave
these 2 kids alone.\\
197 - Yeah.\\
198 - Say, hey there, Donna.\\
199 - Hey, dad.\\
200 - Ah, you kids.\\
201 - Standing around the driveway.\\
202 - It's so darn cute.\\
203 - You know,
you may not realize it,\\
204 - but this is the most fun
you're ever gonna have.\\
205 - So it's all downhill
from here, sir?\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - What happened
to your dad's hair?\\
208 - He got a permanent.\\
209 - So that's permanent?\\
210 - Baby, baby, baby, baby,
baby, oh\\
211 - I may not say this right
because I am new too English...\\
212 - But she has
tremendous breasts, yes?\\
213 - Michael, who is this guy?\\
214 - Oh, that's Fez.\\
215 - He's a foreign exchange student.\\
216 - Who did we exchange for him?\\
217 - Donna, I have to go
to the ladies' room.\\
218 - Donna!\\
219 - I, too, must go to the bathroom.\\
220 - Eric?\\
221 - No, it... Doesn't work
that way with guys.\\
222 - Kelso, how much longer\\
223 - are we gonna have
to deal with the whole\\
224 - Jackie experience?\\
225 - Don't worry.\\
226 - I'm breaking up with her.\\
227 - Never gonna happen.\\
228 - It's over.\\
229 - She's cuttin' in
to my free time.\\
230 - I...\\
231 - Am hooked
on a feeling\\
232 - I'm high
on believing\\
233 - So, is red still thinking about
giving you the car maybe?\\
234 - Ha ha.\\
235 - Even if we do get it,\\
236 - we're gonna need
some serious gas money,\\
237 - 'cause the cruiser's a boat.\\
238 - I know it's a boat.\\
239 - This whole gas shortage bites.\\
240 - Who's getting a boat?\\
241 - There is no gas shortage, man.\\
242 - It's all fake.\\
243 - The oil companies
control everything.\\
244 - Like, there's this guy
who invented this car...\\
245 - That runs on water, man.\\
246 - It's got a fiberglass,
air-cooled engine\\
247 - and it runs on water.\\
248 - So it is a boat.\\
249 - No, it's a car.\\
250 - Only you put water in the
gas tank instead of gas.\\
251 - Ha ha ha ha.\\
252 - And it runs on water, man!\\
253 - I never heard of this car.\\
254 - Hey, Jackie's good
for gas money.\\
255 - You are such a whore.\\
256 - When does the boat
get here, whore?\\
257 - Eric!\\
258 - Yeah, dad?\\
259 - I need to talk to you!\\
260 - Eric...\\
261 - Your mother and I
have been talking.\\
262 - Since I've been cut back
to part-time at the plant...\\
263 - And the, uh, the hospital
is so close,\\
264 - I can take the Toyota to work,\\
265 - and your mom can take the bus.\\
266 - Honey...\\
267 - Honey, really, I'd rather walk.\\
268 - When I ride the bus
in my nurse's uniform,\\
269 - people always show me
their scars.\\
270 - Then I'll drop you off
on my way to the plant.\\
271 - Well, no. I don't want
to be any trouble.\\
272 - Then Eric can drop you off.\\
273 - He's a teenager. He
doesn't want to drop off-\\
274 - well, if he can't drop his
own mother off at work,\\
275 - then I'll be damned
if he's getting a car.\\
276 - Ok.\\
277 - Excuse me.\\
278 - Am I getting the car?\\
279 - We didn't say that.\\
280 - Things don't just drop
into your lap, Eric.\\
281 - Not in this life.\\
282 - A car is a responsibility.\\
283 - You'll need insurance.\\
284 - Do you have any idea
how much insurance is?\\
285 - A car is a privilege.\\
286 - Oil changes, road flares...\\
287 - Fluids.
That's your job!\\
288 - A car is not
a bedroom on wheels.\\
289 - Always yield. Always.\\
290 - Lori's friend got pregnant in
a car. Don't let that happen.\\
291 - If I find one beer can
in that car, it's over.\\
292 - And no doughnuts, either.\\
293 - Ants.\\
294 - So...\\
295 - Do I get the car?\\
296 - Bitching!
Eric.\\
297 - Not in front of your mother.\\
298 - Thank you, pop...\\
299 - Sir.\\
300 - Yeah. Well...\\
301 - Clean the attic.\\
302 - Kelso, that's sweet.\\
303 - Actually, I'm riding shotgun.\\
304 - No, you're not.\\
305 - Well, I'm not riding
in the back.\\
306 - Why don't we let Eric decide?\\
307 - Eric?\\
308 - Kelso...\\
309 - Get in the back.\\
310 - Taking it for a spin, eh?\\
311 - Yes, sir.\\
312 - Well, have a good time.\\
313 - Oh, uh...\\
314 - One more thing.\\
315 - Very important.
About the car.\\
316 - She's old, so...\\
317 - No trips out of town.\\
318 - Ever.\\
319 - Understood?\\
320 - Well...\\
321 - Have fun.\\
322 - Well, I guess that's
that. We're not going.\\
323 - Eric, do you want to go?\\
324 - He said no trips out of town.\\
325 - It's your car.
Do you want to go?\\
326 - He's god.\\
327 - I think god would want US
to go to Milwaukee.\\
328 - Eric, you are a 17-year-old man.\\
329 - I'm gonna go with
whatever you say.\\
330 - It's your decision.\\
331 - It is my decision.\\
332 - And my decision is...\\
333 - We're going to a concert.\\
334 - Yeah!\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - The kids are off.\\
337 - I wonder where they're going.\\
338 - Out of town.\\
339 - Are you sure?\\
340 - Of course.\\
341 - I told them not to.\\
342 - So I guess they'll
be gone for a while.\\
343 - Yeah.\\
344 - Let's go.\\
345 - I'm telling you,
we're out of gas.\\
346 - We're not out of gas.\\
347 - It's the battery.\\
348 - It's 6 years old
and shot to hell.\\
349 - I know what.\\
350 - I'll just call my dad.\\
351 - Kelso, tell her.\\
352 - He can't take the car
out of town.\\
353 - I'm not calling his dad.\\
354 - Jackie...\\
355 - Parents talk to each other\\
356 - about how we screw up.\\
357 - Why would he talk about that?\\
358 - They can't help it.\\
359 - Look, say there's a party, see.\\
360 - And all of our parents
are there. Together.\\
361 - Hi, red.
Say, isn't it great\\
362 - all our kids
are such good friends?\\
363 - Yes, Jackie's dad.\\
364 - They're quite the gang of
young people. Ha ha ha ha!\\
365 - Kitty, I love what
you've done with the kitchen!\\
366 - Yes. Aqua and yellow.
Blah, blah, blah.\\
367 - Yak, yak, yak.\\
368 - Speaking of kids,\\
369 - wasn't it lucky triple-a
pulled Eric's butt out of the fire\\
370 - when he took the car to
Milwaukee without your permission?\\
371 - What?\\
372 - Why, that twisted little monkey.\\
373 - I'm grounding him for 10 years.\\
374 - Kids. What are you
gonna do?\\
375 - I say we torture them\\
376 - with plenty of pointless
rules and advice.\\
377 - Hey, everybody,\\
378 - let's hustle.\\
379 - Now... we are in
the middle of nowhere,\\
380 - and I have to go
to the ladies' room.\\
381 - Donna?\\
382 - So...\\
383 - Where you going?\\
384 - Rundgren concert.\\
385 - Cool.\\
386 - So... what, do you
want a battery?\\
387 - 'Cause I can get you a battery.\\
388 - Are they cheap?\\
389 - Or possibly free?\\
390 - 32 bucks. Minimum.\\
391 - All right.
I tell you what.\\
392 - We'll trade you our battery,\\
393 - plus 5 bucks for
one of your batteries.\\
394 - Well, that's a really
sweet deal, my friend...\\
395 - But how about this?\\
396 - How about one battery
for 2 concert tickets?\\
397 - No. We can't give up
2 tickets.\\
398 - Ok.\\
399 - It's either that
or none of US go.\\
400 - So who's out?\\
401 - Well, there's always Jackie.\\
402 - Of course Jackie.
I mean, Jackie's gone.\\
403 - But who else?\\
404 - Oh, I don't know.\\
405 - Jackie's date?\\
406 - Come on. You know
I'm breaking up with her.\\
407 - You guys are chopping me out!\\
408 - I've had to listen to
her for a good hour.\\
409 - A really long hour.\\
410 - God hates me.\\
411 - How can you say god hates you?\\
412 - At least you have
a woman's love.\\
413 - Be happy...\\
414 - Whore.\\
415 - This suit is for leisure.\\
416 - But many times I wear it
to get down to business.\\
417 - Hey, guys,\\
418 - he's dating a man.\\
419 - I'm ok with it.\\
420 - We are so cool to be ok with it.\\
421 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
422 - Kevin.\\
423 - I'll explain later.\\
424 - This isn't working.\\
425 - No.
It's a boy scout belt.\\
426 - The buckle's got a big...\\
427 - No. Michael, before you
speak, please hear my words.\\
428 - I think we should break up.\\
429 - Now?\\
430 - You're not having a good time.\\
431 - I'm having a good time.\\
432 - Really?\\
433 - Yeah!\\
434 - Oh, Michael, I am so glad
you don't want to break up.\\
435 - You were so nice to give your
ticket away so you could be with me.\\
436 - Well...\\
437 - Yeah.\\
438 - That says you don't need music,\\
439 - concerts,\\
440 - friends...\\
441 - You know what you need, Michael?\\
442 - I don't know.\\
443 - Me. You need me.
M-e, Michael!\\
444 - Yeah.\\
445 - I... i guess.\\
446 - Yeah. You're just
too shy to say that...\\
447 - Lover.\\
448 - So...\\
449 - When were you a boy scout?\\
450 - Hello, it's me\\
451 - What a great night.\\
452 - You know, it's amazing\\
453 - what one act of civil
disobedience can do for you.\\
454 - I mean, there's a whole world
that's waiting to be driven to.\\
455 - We could go to...\\
456 - Canada.\\
457 - We got a new battery.
What's stopping US?\\
458 - You know, I think
Canada closes at 9:30.\\
459 - Yeah.\\
460 - You know, I never
would have done this\\
461 - if you hadn't talked me into it.\\
462 - I didn't talk you into anything.\\
463 - Well...\\
464 - I'm gonna call it a day.\\
465 - Good night.\\
466 - Good night.\\
467 - By the way...\\
468 - Thanks for the ride.\\
469 - What was that for?\\
470 - I just... Wanted to see
what it was like.\\
471 - What was it like?\\
472 - You were there.\\
473 - Yeah, i... i wasn't ready for it.\\
474 - What would you
have done differently?\\
475 - I don't know.\\
476 - Something with my lips.\\
477 - Sounds good.\\
478 - Let's try that next time.\\
479 - When exactly is next time?\\
480 - Good night.\\
481 - Yeah, I'm really
gonna sleep after that.\\
482 - ...to me\\
483 - that you got
to have free...\\
484 - Freedom\\
485 - 'cause I never want
to make you change\\
486 - for me\\
487 - Boy, we're good!
Ha ha!\\
488 - We are really good!

61 - Look, I know money is tight,\\
62 - so I don't want a big birthday.\\
63 - I'll decide when money is tight.\\
64 - Now, what kind of
gift do you want?\\
65 - Don't worry about the cost.
As long as it's reasonable.\\
66 - Okay. I would like
a cassette player for the car.\\
67 - A cassette.
Not an eight-track.\\
68 - No eight-track, okay?\\
69 - You know, I don't know why
they don't just\\
70 - put record players in cars.\\
71 - The point is,\\
72 - I don't want an
eight-track tape player.\\
73 - - Then you won't get one.
- Oh, but, honey, he wants one.\\
74 - No, I want a tape player,
just not an eight-track.\\
75 - You'll get a Delco.\\
76 - A genuine GM part
for your genuine GM car.\\
77 - It doesn't have to be a Delco.
It's just for music.\\
78 - See, now there's
your first mistake.\\
79 - Parts have to be
compatible, Eric.\\
80 - You're not burning cheap gas
in that car, are you?\\
81 - No, sir.\\
82 - Well, I'm going out.\\
83 - Good. Um...\\
84 - I want you to run
to the store for me.\\
85 - Get a large can of frosting\\
86 - and 15 small bags of M&M's.
Plain, not peanuts.\\
87 - They're for your sister.\\
88 - That was close.\\
89 - - So?
- What?\\
90 - What are you going to get Eric
for his birthday?\\
91 - I don't know.\\
92 - Nothing seems right.\\
93 - I want to give him
something special.\\
94 - He kissed you!\\
95 - Get in the car.
Donna, get in the car\\
96 - so we can talk.\\
97 - Okay, what happened?\\
98 - Jackie, I'm not gonna talk
to you about this.\\
99 - Then who are you gonna talk to?\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - We get home from
the Rundgren Concert\\
102 - and I'm sitting on
the hood of the car,\\
103 - and I kissed him.\\
104 - French or American?\\
105 - I can't believe I'm
talking to you about this.\\
106 - Guys, no.\\
107 - Okay, so...\\
108 - Look, I've lived next door
to Eric my entire life\\
109 - and we talk about
everything together.\\
110 - We love the same music,
we love the Packers.\\
111 - Then I kissed him,
and everything changed.\\
112 - Now I don't know if he's my
boyfriend or best friend.\\
113 - If he's my boyfriend,
I'd lose my best friend.\\
114 - If I screw it up, I lose both.\\
115 - Now I have to get him
this gift and I don't know...\\
116 - Donna, Donna!\\
117 - I've solved it.\\
118 - Get him a scented candle.\\
119 - A scented candle?\\
120 - It's practical and romantic.\\
121 - Oh, yeah.\\
122 - Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!\\
123 - I have the
ball last. I win.\\
124 - No, you didn't win.\\
125 - Yes, I had the ball last and...\\
126 - Holy Mother.\\
127 - Hello, Laurie.\\
128 - Hello, Kelso. Hyde.\\
129 - Who is the goddess?\\
130 - The goddess is Eric's sister.\\
131 - She's not a goddess.\\
132 - She's more
the earth mother whore type,\\
133 - which works for me.\\
134 - - Laurie.
- Eric.\\
135 - - Shouldn't you
put some clothes on?
- Why?\\
136 - Aren't you a little cold?\\
137 - No, in fact, I'm hot.\\
138 - Oh, then why don't
you go upstairs?\\
139 - I am waiting for my jeans
to come out of the dryer.\\
140 - And I want you to
stay off my case.\\
141 - It'll only take me a minute.\\
142 - I don't think Kelso's
gonna last that long.\\
143 - Too bad.
It's not like I'm\\
144 - completely naked under this.\\
145 - I'm wearing underwear.
See?\\
146 - If we were at the beach,
you wouldn't even notice me.\\
147 - If we were at the beach,\\
148 - Kelso would be in
the water right now.\\
149 - So, I understand you
have the wagon now.\\
150 - I want to borrow it
tomorrow night, I need it.\\
151 - Okay. But I need a favor.\\
152 - For you? I don't think so.\\
153 - Come on.\\
154 - Look, just tell Mom I'm too old\\
155 - for surprise parties.\\
156 - But you're the baby,
and Mama loves her baby.\\
157 - If you do it, you can borrow
the Vista Cruiser.\\
158 - - All night.
- All night?\\
159 - Fine.\\
160 - Then, it's a deal, baby.\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - Your sister wants me.\\
163 - I mean, you saw her
coming on to me, right?\\
164 - Let him go.\\
165 - Remember?
I said, "Hello, Laurie."\\
166 - And Laurie said...\\
167 - Hello, Kelso.\\
168 - I'm waiting and I want you.\\
169 - Baby. Take me now.\\
170 - I need it bad.
I need it all night.\\
171 - And Mama loves her baby.\\
172 - I'm completely naked under this.\\
173 - And I'm hot for you, Kelso.\\
174 - What?\\
175 - You didn't see it?\\
176 - Get out of the yard!\\
177 - So, how's your friend Janice?\\
178 - Pregnant.\\
179 - Oh, she was such a nice girl.
How does that happen?\\
180 - Well,\\
181 - first the egg travels down
the fallopian tube to the uterus\\
182 - where it attaches to the wall.\\
183 - Eric, for God's sakes,\\
184 - that's no language
for a woman to hear.\\
185 - It's okay, Red.
I know\\
186 - what a fallopian tube is.\\
187 - I think Mom does, too.\\
188 - Well, I just don't like\\
189 - my little boy
bandying those words about.\\
190 - You're still my baby.\\
191 - Thanks, Mom.\\
192 - Laurie?\\
193 - Quit staring at your sister
and eat your carrots.\\
194 - Oh, yeah, Eric
wanted me to tell you\\
195 - that he thinks he's
too old for a party.\\
196 - Keys.\\
197 - There's no party.\\
198 - Laurie, loose lips.\\
199 - Oh, Laurie, I just remembered.\\
200 - I can't loan you
the Vista Cruiser\\
201 - on account of I hate you.\\
202 - Laurie, you're not
driving the Vista Cruiser.\\
203 - It's old and undependable.\\
204 - It could break down
and you'd be at the mercy\\
205 - of any maniac who came along.\\
206 - It's okay for Eric,
but you're taking the Toyota.\\
207 - Oh, and, uh, here's $20.\\
208 - Will that cover gas?\\
209 - Oh, well, it should.
Honey, honey.\\
210 - Give her another
$10, just in case.\\
211 - You know, I could
probably use some gas money.\\
212 - Yeah,
and if a frog had wings,\\
213 - he wouldn't bump
his ass when he hops.\\
214 - Coming. I'm coming.\\
215 - Donna?\\
216 - Donna, it's 3:00 a.m.
Are you crazy?\\
217 - Crazy? Crazy in love with you.\\
218 - What is it about you
that drives me\\
219 - wild with passion and desire?\\
220 - Well, I am 17 now.\\
221 - Shut up, and sit down.\\
222 - I have to give you
your birthday present.\\
223 - It can't wait any longer.\\
224 - Close your eyes.\\
225 - This is my birthday present?\\
226 - No, that's my nightgown.\\
227 - I'm your present.
Open your eyes, birthday boy.\\
228 - Surprise!\\
229 - Birthday breakfast.\\
230 - And this is it, young man.
A few gifts tonight, the end.\\
231 - And it is too late to change
your mind about a party now.\\
232 - So don't think
you're getting one\\
233 - or you will be
sorely disappointed.\\
234 - Happy birthday.\\
235 - You know, the lawn's
not gonna cut itself.\\
236 - Thanks, Mom, Dad.\\
237 - Hey, little brother.
Nice tent.\\
238 - Look, I know what
you're all doing here.\\
239 - What are you talking about, man?\\
240 - We're just hanging out.
Like always.\\
241 - Except we're dressed nice.\\
242 - But that doesn't mean anything.\\
243 - Hi, kids.
Um...\\
244 - I need your help with something.\\
245 - Jackie, Donna,
Michael, Steven...\\
246 - young man with an accent,
could you give me a hand?\\
247 - Not you, Eric.\\
248 - God, I can't take it.\\
249 - - But I...
- No.\\
250 - - No, I...
- No.\\
251 - Eric? Eric, honey.\\
252 - Honey, could you come up here
for a second?\\
253 - Shut up. He's coming.\\
254 - Surprise!\\
255 - Wow!\\
256 - I mean, yeah.\\
257 - It's an eight-track tape player.\\
258 - - I see that.
- Just what you asked for.\\
259 - You made such a big deal
about it, I wrote it down.\\
260 - - Cassettes. Great. Thanks, Hyde.
- You're welcome.\\
261 - Oh! Let's put them in the
eight-track and play them.\\
262 - Hey, it's a hot-shave dispenser.\\
263 - Oh, he won't need
that for a long time.\\
264 - A long, long time.\\
265 - Of course he will.
He's almost like a man.\\
266 - - I got you something.
- No.\\
267 - Donna, help me
find my purse... now!\\
268 - Jackie, you didn't
even bring a purse.\\
269 - Duh.\\
270 - You can't give him your present\\
271 - in front of his guy friends.\\
272 - I am one of his guy friends.\\
273 - Look, Donna, I have put\\
274 - a lot of thought into this gift.\\
275 - Please do not wreck this for me.\\
276 - I'm sorry.
I guess I was being selfish.\\
277 - It's okay.\\
278 - Okay, it's time we disappeared.\\
279 - What? Honey,
the party just started.\\
280 - I know. That's why we're
going over to Bob's.\\
281 - Well, I wanted to
give Eric a party.
- And you did.\\
282 - You make a mess,
you're all grounded.\\
283 - You darn kids.\\
284 - Well, you know, what if they run\\
285 - out of ketchup or something.\\
286 - - Let's go.
- Okay. We have more buns\\
287 - and, uh, sweet pickles if
you don't like the dill.\\
288 - Okay, I'd love to stay,
but I'm leaving.\\
289 - Hey, buy us some beers?
We'll pay double.\\
290 - Do you really think that beer\\
291 - will make your
little party better?\\
292 - Yes.\\
293 - I admit it would give
you young people\\
294 - a sense of maturity...\\
295 - but it would be
a false maturity,\\
296 - and that would be wrong.\\
297 - So you're not going to do it?\\
298 - Of course not.\\
299 - Now, I'm going off to join
my legal friends\\
300 - at a party with a keg.
Bye.\\
301 - So, Laurie...\\
302 - where's the party?
You know, maybe we'll\\
303 - cruise by later.\\
304 - In your dreams, you idiot.\\
305 - Okay, you guys had to see that.\\
306 - Three fours, I need them.\\
307 - Bob is very good at Yahtzee.\\
308 - - The liquor cabinet.
- It's locked.\\
309 - - What if there's an emergency?
- They'll call.\\
310 - - What if they
run out of chips?
- They'll starve.\\
311 - I'm gonna fix
myself a Tom Collins.\\
312 - Red?\\
313 - - No, Kitty needs one.
- I am just so worried.\\
314 - Oh, my Lord.
Laurie's leaving.\\
315 - Well, honey, she's in college.\\
316 - She doesn't want
to hang around with them.\\
317 - Well, maybe I should
make a call, just in case...\\
318 - Kitty, what could happen?\\
319 - What could happen?\\
320 - Well, plenty could happen.\\
321 - Oh, plenty.\\
322 - Now that
the adults are gone,\\
323 - we can be as bad as we want.\\
324 - Who wants to give
Eric a venereal disease?\\
325 - Hey, look. Coasters.\\
326 - Forget coasters!\\
327 - Please, fellas...\\
328 - my mom put out
coasters for a reason.\\
329 - I think I'm gonna put my drink\\
330 - directly on the furniture.\\
331 - That way, it will leave a ring.\\
332 - No!\\
333 - Why, oh, why didn't
I beg my mother to stay?\\
334 - Quiet, you silly American.\\
335 - I am making a long distance call\\
336 - on your parents' phone.\\
337 - But that's immoral.\\
338 - Ha! In my country of...\\
339 - Wherever it is I am from,
I can never tell.\\
340 - Morals get in the way
of a good dirty time.\\
341 - But first,
I need to eat some chips.\\
342 - What? Out of chips?\\
343 - Now I am mad.\\
344 - I must shoot something.\\
345 - Not the littlest hobo!\\
346 - Why?\\
347 - You're over-reacting.\\
348 - Oh, Kitty, when Valerie\\
349 - went off to school,
I felt the same way\\
350 - but this little book
of poems helped me.\\
351 - It's called,
"Verses from an empty nest."\\
352 - Read her that one about\\
353 - - the little bird
that lost its way.
- Ooh, yeah.\\
354 - "The little bird
that once did sing\\
355 - "is now alone
with broken wing."\\
356 - Oh, God.\\
357 - Yep, that sounds nice.\\
358 - I need a refill.\\
359 - But, honey, usually
you only drink one.\\
360 - Well, tonight I'm having two.\\
361 - Wait on the porch,
and I'll get Eric.\\
362 - It's dark out there.\\
363 - And you're giving
him a candle. Yeah.\\
364 - - Here, matches.
- He might not
want to light it.\\
365 - Don't say that.
Don't even think it.\\
366 - Now, when he opens it,
he'll say cool or something.\\
367 - And then you give
him a look like this.\\
368 - So, what did you get from Donna?\\
369 - Nothing, yet.\\
370 - Oh.\\
371 - Maybe it's the big gift.\\
372 - You know, the really big gift.\\
373 - You guys know what I'm saying\\
374 - when I say,
"the big gift," right?\\
375 - Yeah, we got it.\\
376 - And we got it.\\
377 - I'm not even from
here and I got it.\\
378 - Oh, Eric.\\
379 - Donna's on the porch.\\
380 - He's getting the big gift!\\
381 - Oh, a sand candle.
This is very cool.\\
382 - Oh, it's nothing.\\
383 - Are you okay?\\
384 - Oh, I'm fine. Yeah.\\
385 - 'Cause you, you had a look
like you might be\\
386 - sick or something.\\
387 - I am just being
completely stupid.\\
388 - Hey, that's my job.\\
389 - I was worried about the gift.\\
390 - Why? This is a very cool gift.\\
391 - I'd light it if I had matches.\\
392 - Oh. Here.\\
393 - You thought of everything.\\
394 - Well... Happy birthday.\\
395 - Aw!\\
396 - Look at this.\\
397 - Oh!\\
398 - We never thought to
put a candle out here.\\
399 - Oh, it is just so romantic.\\
400 - Let's keep moving.\\
401 - There's nothing to see out here.\\
402 - Thanks, Dad.\\
403 - Oh. We have
candles in the bedroom,\\
404 - don't we?\\
405 - This is it. He's going for it.\\
406 - Oh, no.\\
407 - It's his birthday,
she should kiss him first.\\
408 - She did last time.\\
409 - - What?
- Nothing.\\
410 - Shut up and watch.\\
411 - Come on, Forman, go for it.\\
412 - The door's open,
we can hear you.\\
413 - We can see you.\\
414 - Is he kissing her?\\
415 - None of us
can see them, Fez.\\
416 - Eric,
are you kissing her?
\subsection {Episode 03: Streaking}
1 - Push. Push.\\
2 - Come on, you gotta push it.\\
3 - - How much longer?
- 10 seconds.\\
4 - You gotta push harder
or it's not gonna work.\\
5 - This is so stupid.\\
6 - It's not stupid.
You're gonna love it.\\
7 - I'm not, not gonna love it.\\
8 - Okay, that's time.\\
9 - Step away from the door.\\
10 - - Ah!
- Oh!\\
11 - Kelso, you're a genius.\\
12 - Yeah, well, it's magic.\\
13 - Oh, my God. Finally.\\
14 - I am so dehydrated.\\
15 - Oh, here. Piggly-Wiggly
Diet Creme Soda.\\
16 - I told you my top three choices
were Tab, Fresca, or Diet Rite.\\
17 - Again, you get Piggly-Wiggly
Diet Creme Soda.\\
18 - Then I'll just have water.\\
19 - You know, there's
a hose in the backyard.\\
20 - I've noticed that the pop
selection has really went downhill\\
21 - since your dad got laid off.\\
22 - He's not laid off,
he's just part-time.\\
23 - And shut up.\\
24 - Kids.\\
25 - Kids, kids, kids, kids,
kids, kids, kids...\\
26 - The President is coming.\\
27 - What President?\\
28 - The President of these United
States, Gerald R. Ford, the 36th...\\
29 - Eighth... 40th...\\
30 - I don't know.
He's the President.\\
31 - Why would Ford
come to Point Place?\\
32 - Because we are
a whistle stop along\\
33 - his Wisconsin campaign trail.
My dad organized it.\\
34 - Dear, the next time\\
35 - you know a president
is coming to town,\\
36 - please give me a little more
notice. I need to vacuum.\\
37 - Eric, you tidy up this basement.\\
38 - A pie! I gotta make a pie!\\
39 - Wow. The President's coming.\\
40 - You know what we should do?
That door thing again.\\
41 - Yeah!\\
42 - Hanging out\\
43 - Down the street\\
44 - The same old thing\\
45 - We did last week\\
46 - Not a thing to do\\
47 - But talk to you\\
48 - Whoa, yeah\\
49 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
50 - - So how's the car?
- Real good.\\
51 - By real good, you mean
you rotated those tires\\
52 - like I asked you to?\\
53 - Dad, don't they
rotate every time I drive?\\
54 - - You being a smart mouth?
- Yes, and I'm sorry.\\
55 - Tuna casserole again?\\
56 - Well, okay, how about we
don't pay the car insurance\\
57 - and we'll all have steak?\\
58 - All right.\\
59 - Well, just imagine,
President Ford is coming here.\\
60 - Uh, Red, we need to get rid
of the oil stains in the driveway.\\
61 - It's not like he's
coming to our house.\\
62 - And if he did,
I'd kick him in the keister.\\
63 - Stop it. How can you say that?
You voted for Gerald Ford.\\
64 - Kitty, no one voted
for Gerald Ford.\\
65 - But he still is our President.\\
66 - Oh, the boy's old enough
to hear that kind of talk.\\
67 - Eric, say that your job was sent to a
plant in Guatela-who-the-hell-cares.\\
68 - Now, are you gonna vote for
the guy that let that happen?\\
69 - Red, President Ford didn't
take your job. He took Nixon's.\\
70 - Eric, we're waiting.\\
71 - Um...\\
72 - Well...\\
73 - I believe that everyone's political
opinion is valid and worth hearing.\\
74 - Well, that's...
That's perfect, Eric.\\
75 - Use that line
when you run for Miss America.\\
76 - Settle down
and we'll start the assembly.\\
77 - Now, concerning
the canned goods drive.\\
78 - Motor oil is not a food.\\
79 - I'm sorry, it's not. And all your
booing isn't gonna make it one.\\
80 - Now...
As you all know,\\
81 - President Ford will be
visiting our fair city.\\
82 - And I know there are some
of you ne'er-do-wells out there\\
83 - that might be
planning some sort of,\\
84 - quote-unquote,
social statement-type protest.\\
85 - I can't believe this.
Who cares if Ford is coming?\\
86 - It's better than when the Oscar
Mayer Weeniemobile drove through.\\
87 - They didn't even stop.\\
88 - They just slowed down and threw
a bunch of hot dog whistles at us.\\
89 - Two girls in a phallic RV.\\
90 - Driving around,
handing out things you blow.\\
91 - What a great country.\\
92 - So let me tell
you another thing,\\
93 - Mr. or Mrs. Punk.\\
94 - Protesting accomplishes nothing.\\
95 - Oh, sure,\\
96 - you might see a chance\\
97 - to prove your manhood\\
98 - or show you're cool,\\
99 - but this is our President.\\
100 - Our President, darn it!\\
101 - So no shenanigans, you hear me?\\
102 - And if that's your
kind of attitude,\\
103 - you might just as
well go home right now.\\
104 - So President Ford
should be arriving at noon.\\
105 - Oh, man!
Deviled eggs.\\
106 - Are... Are these
for anybody?\\
107 - Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Mr. Pinciotti.\\
108 - - Hi.
- Hi, kitten.\\
109 - Now, look, we're talking
about adult stuff here.\\
110 - Why don't you and your friend
head up to your room?\\
111 - Now, the most important part
of our presidential rally\\
112 - is the townspeople
"Q & A" section.\\
113 - Just so everyone's clear,\\
114 - the "Q" stands for "Question",
the "A" for "Answer."\\
115 - All yours, Jack.\\
116 - This is where normal folks
step up to the microphone\\
117 - and ask the President questions.\\
118 - Now, the important thing is to
choose the right person, you know.\\
119 - A working-class guy.
Your average Joe.\\
120 - I guess someone you
and I would call a loser.\\
121 - So, of course,
I thought of you.\\
122 - We'd like you to ask
President Ford a question.\\
123 - So what do you say to that?\\
124 - I say, no, thank you,\\
125 - and I want my
crescent wrench back.\\
126 - - I'll do it.
- No, no. You keep
working on your pies.\\
127 - Just imagine, Red,
you, the little guy,\\
128 - get to have your opinions heard by
the most powerful man in America.\\
129 - Take advantage of
this opportunity.\\
130 - Turn that light off.\\
131 - Sorry.\\
132 - Look, guys, we gotta do something
that says we will not pay homage\\
133 - to a corrupt electoral system.\\
134 - I know. A bloody coup.\\
135 - That's good,\\
136 - but we're looking
for something great.\\
137 - Something that would make our
founding fathers proud, man, you know?\\
138 - - Let's streak!
- Bingo!\\
139 - Yeah!\\
140 - I've always wanted to do that,\\
141 - just run buck naked
through a sea of people.\\
142 - Be free and shake it around.\\
143 - All right, who's in?\\
144 - Will people be chasing us
with torches and pointy sticks?\\
145 - - No.
- Then I am in.\\
146 - Great! Eric?\\
147 - - Are you in?
- Okay, streaking. I'm...\\
148 - Don't get me wrong,
I'm completely pro-nudity,\\
149 - but I think my dad might kill
me, and I'm anti-being killed.\\
150 - Hey, if there wasn't
some huge downside\\
151 - to doing something this stupid,\\
152 - it wouldn't be worth doing,
you know?\\
153 - Good point.\\
154 - Oh! And I could write
some really great slogan like\\
155 - "I hate the fuzz" on my ass.\\
156 - If you hate the fuzz
on your ass,\\
157 - why don't you just shave it off?\\
158 - Who, me? Ha ha ha!\\
159 - Pretty snazzy, eh?\\
160 - Looking good, Dad.\\
161 - I got one for you, too.\\
162 - We're gonna wear them
to meet the President.\\
163 - No. No way.\\
164 - Honey, you're missing
the big picture.\\
165 - Let me go get the other
jumpsuits. You'll see.\\
166 - Mom, why are you doing this?\\
167 - Honey, there are lots of things
I do to make your father happy\\
168 - that I don't really like.\\
169 - Mom, ugh!\\
170 - No, not that. I love that.\\
171 - I meant like fishing.\\
172 - See? When we stand together,
we're the American flag.\\
173 - I'm not wearing
a striped jumpsuit.\\
174 - Oh, no, honey.
You're the field of blue.\\
175 - Bye, now.\\
176 - But, Donna,
you're part of the family.\\
177 - Oh, my, this hurts.\\
178 - - Yello.
- Good news, Bob.\\
179 - I've been thinking about it, and
I've decided I will ask Ford a question.\\
180 - Oh, jeez, Red.
This is good news.\\
181 - And I
could sure use it right about now.\\
182 - Yeah, well, glad I could help.\\
183 - Oh, I'm gonna ask him
a question, all right.\\
184 - And it's gonna be
a damn good one.\\
185 - Red.\\
186 - Now, don't worry.\\
187 - I'm simply gonna ask him how
the hell he's gonna fix this economy.\\
188 - Oh, honey,
he wouldn't know that.\\
189 - He's the President.\\
190 - All this food for 45 cents,
it is unbelievable.\\
191 - Oh, I see.\\
192 - So, Forman, the rally's tonight,
man. What's your decision?\\
193 - Yeah, are you gonna
streak or not?\\
194 - Don't pressure him.\\
195 - No, I've been doing
some thinking, and I'm in.\\
196 - - All right.
- Well, you're gonna look
like a bunch of idiots.\\
197 - A bunch of naked idiots.\\
198 - Thanks, Kelso.\\
199 - Look, we must keep this quiet.\\
200 - It can't go beyond this table.\\
201 - If my father finds out what we've
planned, he will nail me to the wall.\\
202 - Why are you all sitting on
one side of the table, huh?\\
203 - Okay, now.\\
204 - Make way for my
Presidential pies.\\
205 - See? Cherry,
mock apple, blueberry.\\
206 - See that?
Red, white, and blue.\\
207 - It's like the beginning to
Love, American Style in pie.\\
208 - Look. Lookit.\\
209 - See, honey, you're not looking.\\
210 - Yeah, pie.\\
211 - Here, Dad. Mr. Pinciotti
wanted me to give you this.\\
212 - - What is it?
- It's your question
for President Ford.\\
213 - But I'm working on my question
for President Ford.\\
214 - Right. Well, this is the one
the committee made up for you.\\
215 - "What has been
your favorite parade?"\\
216 - This is asinine.\\
217 - - Macy's?
- No contest.\\
218 - Right.\\
219 - Can I borrow your trench coat?\\
220 - I can ask the President
any damn thing I want.\\
221 - It's my right.\\
222 - I'm not gonna be a puppet
for Bob's committee.\\
223 - Right, I'll take real
good care of it\\
224 - and I'll bring it back
as soon as I possibly can.\\
225 - Honey, just take the coat
and leave.\\
226 - No. Eric, a man\\
227 - has to stand up and be heard.\\
228 - I will not sit quietly by\\
229 - while everything is
taken away from me.\\
230 - They took my job, my stability.\\
231 - Now they want to take away
my right to free speech.\\
232 - You still have the Toyota,
it gets great mileage.\\
233 - Where is the America
that I knew as a boy?\\
234 - Where?\\
235 - You tell me, dear God, where?\\
236 - Okay, I really hate being
in this room right now.\\
237 - Okay, when the President
starts his speech here,\\
238 - I'll blow my Oscar
Mayer whistle and we go.\\
239 - Did you write, "I hate
the fuzz" on your butt?\\
240 - Yeah.\\
241 - Donna,
here's your lipstick back.\\
242 - Keep it.\\
243 - - You got the masks?
- Yeah, I got three
Snoopys and one Nixon.\\
244 - Not it.\\
245 - Damn. Fez, how'd you know
how to do that?\\
246 - My country invented "not it."\\
247 - So can we go already?\\
248 - I'm itching to
release the hound here.\\
249 - It's go time.\\
250 - Oh, well, now look at you guys.\\
251 - What is it with you
young people and Columbo?\\
252 - Bye.\\
253 - Bye.\\
254 - Aren't you going, Donna?\\
255 - No. My dad's gonna make me
wear this really queer jumpsuit.\\
256 - I don't know if I can do it.
It's just too embarrassing.\\
257 - You know, Donna, my
grandmother came from Sweden,\\
258 - and she had this
thick, thick accent,\\
259 - and it embarrassed me to no end.\\
260 - Well, I asked her not to come
to my high school graduation\\
261 - 'cause I didn't want my
friends to hear her talk,\\
262 - and she didn't come.\\
263 - Sixteen years later,
she got the gout and died.\\
264 - You see?\\
265 - No.\\
266 - All families are embarrassing.\\
267 - And if they're not
embarrassing, then they're dead.\\
268 - All right, try
and blend in, huh?\\
269 - ...see you
alone like that,\\
270 - so I came over and here you are.\\
271 - Hey, you hitting
on my girlfriend?\\
272 - Michael, he's not...\\
273 - Hey, man! All right,
you wanna go? Come on!\\
274 - Yeah, let's go, cowboy!\\
275 - - You are so lucky
I'm naked, pal.
- Shut up.\\
276 - There's supposed to be
a blue field of stars there.\\
277 - Oh, honey.\\
278 - Now, if we just start
to sway back and forth,\\
279 - it'll look like the flag
is waving in the wind.\\
280 - Oh, God.\\
281 - Hey, there's another guy
in a trench coat.\\
282 - I bet he's a streaker, too.\\
283 - Fez, he's with Secret Service.\\
284 - - How about that man?
- Yeah, Secret Service.\\
285 - - And that man?
- Yeah.\\
286 - And that man with
the dog? - Yeah.\\
287 - - Oh, the dog is looking at us. Come here, boy.
- No, Fez!\\
288 - Oh! Man, I just
thought of something.\\
289 - What?\\
290 - What are we going to do
with our trench coats?\\
291 - I mean, after we rip them off, we
can't come back here and get them.\\
292 - - Oh!
- Oh, shucks.\\
293 - God, this is all my fault.
You know what?\\
294 - I'll hold the coats.
You guys streak.\\
295 - - Thanks.
- Thanks.\\
296 - I just thought
of something, too.\\
297 - We're naked, and
there's a lot of dogs here.\\
298 - Maybe we should just sit down.\\
299 - - I'm in.
- Me, too.\\
300 - - Me, too.
- Okay.\\
301 - Ladies and gentlemen...\\
302 - ...the President of the
United States of America,\\
303 - Gerald R. Ford!\\
304 - Ooh!\\
305 - Yay!\\
306 - Ooh!\\
307 - Yay!\\
308 - Ooh!\\
309 - Hey. What are you doing
hiding over... Oh, okay.\\
310 - Back off. I am a flag.\\
311 - Are you gonna streak?\\
312 - No, we took a vote
and it's unanimous.\\
313 - We're all very chicken.\\
314 - That's too bad. It's been a
while since I've seen you naked.\\
315 - - You've never seen me naked.
- Like a zillion times.\\
316 - When we were kids, you were always
running around the neighborhood naked,\\
317 - screaming, "Wee, wee!
Pee, pee!"\\
318 - Now it's time for the "Q & A"
portion of our program.\\
319 - First up, I'd like to
introduce Red Forman.\\
320 - Red is a father of two
wonderful children,\\
321 - and how he's managed to
keep them clothed and fed\\
322 - while being cut back to halftime
at the plant is beyond me.\\
323 - But he doesn't blame the
President for his misfortune.\\
324 - No, sir.
He only blames himself.\\
325 - I give you Red Forman.\\
326 - Mr. President...\\
327 - I...\\
328 - I...\\
329 - Come on, Red.\\
330 - Your dad is bombing.\\
331 - Wee, wee! Pee, pee!\\
332 - Wee, wee! Pee, pee!\\
333 - Hey, Gerry.\\
334 - Here's my question.\\
335 - How the hell could
you pardon Nixon?\\
336 - - Hey, son.
- Hi, Dad.\\
337 - Hey, um, good job
at the rally today.\\
338 - Not bad.\\
339 - I kind of stumbled
there at the start,\\
340 - but I think I nailed him
with a good one.\\
341 - Well, anyway, it was...\\
342 - It was pretty cool.\\
343 - Yeah, well,\\
344 - sometimes a man's gotta do
what he thinks is right.\\
345 - Yeah, I'm gonna call it a night.\\
346 - All right, son.\\
347 - Good night.\\
348 - Good night, Dad.\\
349 - Oh, and, uh,\\
350 - next time,
don't wear black socks.\\
351 - You look like an ass.\\
352 - How could they not catch you?\\
353 - I guess no one wants
to tackle a naked guy.\\
354 - So true.\\
355 - Hey, you didn't, uh...\\
356 - You didn't see anything,
did you?\\
357 - No.\\
358 - Well,\\
359 - maybe just a bit.\\
360 - But not the bit.\\
361 - Wait, what do you mean "bit"?
\subsection {Episode 04: Battle of the Sexists}
1 - I'm waiting.\\
2 - Forget it.\\
3 - Just say it and she'll go home.\\
4 - Fine.\\
5 - You're right, Jackie, the
Fonz could beat up Bruce Lee.\\
6 - Thank you. Now, Michael,
call me tonight at 8:00.\\
7 - - But that's when
Chico and the Man is on.
- I know.\\
8 - But I like it when
you describe it to me.\\
9 - Oh, do your Chico impersonation.\\
10 - I don't think these guys
really want to hear my...\\
11 - - Sure we would.
- Go ahead, Michael. By all means. Please.\\
12 - All right.\\
13 - Looking good!\\
14 - I love this!\\
15 - Hey, Kelso, quick question.\\
16 - Why can't you date someone
a little less annoying?\\
17 - Like who?\\
18 - - What about Barbara Vansen?
- She's just as
annoying as Jackie.\\
19 - - Yeah, but her boobs are huge.
- So?\\
20 - Do you find that annoying?\\
21 - Pam Macy.\\
22 - Now she's got
some knockers, baby.\\
23 - True, but they're not
bigger than Barbara's.\\
24 - - Yeah, they are.
- You're dreaming.\\
25 - It's like comparing
Exodus and Deuteronomy,\\
26 - both of which have taught us
very valuable lessons.\\
27 - Oh. Hi, Dad.\\
28 - Damn dryer's broken.\\
29 - Ah, nuts.
I need my vice grips.\\
30 - Have you seen Pam in a tube top?\\
31 - It's like you're
looking at the Grand Tetons.\\
32 - In a tube top.\\
33 - Look, the issue isn't,
are Pam's big, right?\\
34 - The issue is, are they
bigger than Barbara's?\\
35 - Because Barbara's are
bigger than the walls of Jericho,\\
36 - which, as we all know,
came tumbling down, right?\\
37 - - Hello, Mrs. Forman.
- Hi. Eric, did your
father come down here?\\
38 - - Yeah, he's fixing the dryer.
- Oh, dear.\\
39 - You know, ever since
the plant cut back his hours,\\
40 - he spends all his
time fixing things.\\
41 - Things that don't need fixing.\\
42 - Things I need.
Things I use. Things I love.\\
43 - I gotta go hide the crock pot.\\
44 - Sounds like your
dad is losing it.\\
45 - If he's like this now, he's
gonna be a total headcase\\
46 - if they shut down the plant.\\
47 - He's going to be
this pathetic guy\\
48 - with breasts
the size of watermelons!\\
49 - Is what Moses said
to the Egyptians.\\
50 - Kelso, go home.\\
51 - Hanging out\\
52 - Down the street\\
53 - The same old thing\\
54 - We did last week\\
55 - Not a thing to do\\
56 - But talk to you\\
57 - Whoa, yeah\\
58 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
59 - Forman has the ball.\\
60 - He fakes left. He fakes right.
The crowd is on their feet!\\
61 - They're chanting, "Forman!
Forman!"\\
62 - That's game.\\
63 - - I've got winners.
- No, I've got to go.\\
64 - It's almost 8:00,
and I've got to call Jackie.\\
65 - Looking good!\\
66 - Shut up.\\
67 - Pinciotti has the ball.
Forman guards her closely.\\
68 - She tries to shake him,
but she can't.\\
69 - Pinciotti actually scores!
Hell freezes over!\\
70 - - A monkey types Hamlet!
- One nothing.\\
71 - Losers out.\\
72 - Pinciotti, the underdog,
up by five.\\
73 - She fakes right. She fakes
left. She fakes right, then left.\\
74 - She fakes faking right and
fakes left. Now she's actually...\\
75 - - Donna, what are you doing?
- Running out the clock.\\
76 - There is no clock.\\
77 - Sucker.\\
78 - And that's game!
Man, what a slaughter.\\
79 - I just wiped the court with
you, from one end to the other.\\
80 - I gotta go inside,
but I'll leave the light on.\\
81 - I don't want you to
gloat in the dark.\\
82 - Well, hey, Eric, don't
you want your balls back?\\
83 - Okay, now look,
that's a little uncalled for.\\
84 - Oh, uh, yeah.
Thanks.\\
85 - Is this table wobbling?\\
86 - I don't think so.\\
87 - No, it's definitely wobbling.\\
88 - Well, honey, anything will
wobble if you shake it hard enough.\\
89 - Give me a hand, Eric. We're
gonna flip this table over.\\
90 - Honey, we're eating.
We're eating.\\
91 - Yeah, let's just put
a sugar packet under it.\\
92 - Sugar packet?\\
93 - That's what's wrong
with this country, Eric.\\
94 - Nobody wants to roll up
their sleeves and work.\\
95 - They're all looking for
their sugar-packet solution.\\
96 - Well, not me.
I'm getting the saw.\\
97 - Mom, has Dad gone crazy?\\
98 - I'm afraid so, dear.\\
99 - Donna beat you in basketball?\\
100 - Is this true, Eric?\\
101 - Yeah.\\
102 - What, is that a big deal?\\
103 - Of course not.\\
104 - Unless Donna happens to be,
you know, a girl.\\
105 - Especially a girl you love.\\
106 - You know, in my country,
if a woman beats you,\\
107 - it makes her want you.\\
108 - Really?\\
109 - Yes, but this is America, wuss.\\
110 - Wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss.
Wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss.\\
111 - Kelso. Kelso!\\
112 - Would you stop that?\\
113 - Wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss, wuss!\\
114 - Wait, wait, wait.
What about Kelso?\\
115 - I mean, Jackie has
him totally whipped.\\
116 - Whipped like the family pig.\\
117 - I am not pig-whipped.\\
118 - Where do you
even get that stuff?\\
119 - Are you kidding?\\
120 - Michael, call me at 8:00.\\
121 - Michael,
do your Chico impression.\\
122 - Michael, rub oil on my thighs
while I spank you.\\
123 - Please, someone else talk now.\\
124 - - I think we got it.
- That's lovely, Red.\\
125 - - Solid as a rock.
- It sure is. Thank you.\\
126 - Now, um...\\
127 - Why don't you go watch TV
while I get lunch ready?\\
128 - Kitty,\\
129 - take your hand
off of that melon.\\
130 - You know,
you haven't gone fishing...\\
131 - Kitty, take your hand
off that melon.\\
132 - Well, I gotta get back to work.\\
133 - Midge, this table
is a little wobbly.\\
134 - Stick some sugar
packets under it, will you?\\
135 - Hello?\\
136 - Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God!\\
137 - Donna, it's for you.\\
138 - Hello?\\
139 - You beat Eric at basketball!
How could that happen?\\
140 - So I beat Eric at basketball.
What's the big deal?\\
141 - Eric will never be your boyfriend
if you keep beating him at stuff.\\
142 - Okay, it is like
in West Side Story.\\
143 - Now, if Maria beat Tony
at one-on-one,\\
144 - they would have
never fallen in love.\\
145 - Yeah, and Tony never would
have been killed in that knife fight.\\
146 - And neither will Eric
if you're not careful.\\
147 - No. Don't worry about it.
Someone will stab Eric. Bye.\\
148 - Honey, I think your
annoying friend is right.\\
149 - - What?
- Certain things change.\\
150 - Eric and I have been
playing games our whole lives.\\
151 - And sometimes he wins
and sometimes I win.\\
152 - No, I mean the rules change.\\
153 - Women have to pretend
to be weak and fragile\\
154 - so that men can feel superior.\\
155 - That's insane.\\
156 - If women don't learn
to stand up for themselves,\\
157 - men will always
control the world.\\
158 - Oh, honey, men don't
control the world.\\
159 - - Shush!
- Okay, I'll see you later.\\
160 - Honey, could you
open this jar for me?\\
161 - Sure thing, pudding.\\
162 - I'm so lucky to have my big,
strong grizzly bear around.\\
163 - First of all, yuck.\\
164 - Second, things don't even
work like that anymore.\\
165 - That's what the Equal
Rights Amendment is for.\\
166 - That's good, dear.
You stick to your principles.\\
167 - And 40 years from now,\\
168 - you can tell all your cats
how you won a basketball game.\\
169 - Okay, she was going like,
"That is so gross!"\\
170 - And I went like,
"It takes one to know one!"\\
171 - And she was,
like, "Nuh-uh."\\
172 - And I went,
"Yeah, uh-huh."\\
173 - Uh-huh.\\
174 - Man, are you still on the
phone? Come on, let's go.\\
175 - - I can't.
- The movie starts in
five minutes. Let's go.\\
176 - I can't.\\
177 - Wuss.\\
178 - Jackie, hold on.\\
179 - Okay, I'll tell her
there's an emergency,\\
180 - and I gotta go.\\
181 - She'll buy that, right?\\
182 - Yeah, except for one thing.\\
183 - Jackie? Jackie?\\
184 - - Don't be her whipped pig.
- Yeah, look,\\
185 - she hung up on you. Let's go.
You call her later, okay?\\
186 - Yeah, she hung up on me.
Let's go.\\
187 - Yeah! Way to be,
way to be. - That's right.\\
188 - - Do you want to
play air hockey?
- With you?\\
189 - I'd love to,
but I'm kind of tired,\\
190 - and my wrist hurts, and I think
I'm coming down with the flu.\\
191 - Well, it's just as well.
I'm pretty bad at it.\\
192 - - You know, one game
isn't going to kill me.
- Okay.\\
193 - - You serve first.
- Okay.\\
194 - Whoa! No way you could
stop that.\\
195 - That was going so fast,
you couldn't even see that.\\
196 - I saw that.\\
197 - Whoo.\\
198 - Well, that's game.\\
199 - That's...\\
200 - That's great.\\
201 - - Are you okay with that?
- Sure.\\
202 - Bingo.\\
203 - - Crud.
- No. Now look.\\
204 - We'll get rid of these chairs
and we will sit on the floor\\
205 - like those nice Japanese
people in Flower Drum Song.\\
206 - I'll have to make new legs
for that damn thing.\\
207 - I'll be in the garage
if you need me.\\
208 - Okay, now, you take
your time and you do a good job.\\
209 - You call me if
you need anything.\\
210 - Shh!\\
211 - I mean, if...\\
212 - Is it me, or is that
refrigerator too loud?\\
213 - What refrigerator?\\
214 - Red, there is no noise.\\
215 - There is no noise.\\
216 - You'll be swell\\
217 - You'll be great\\
218 - Gonna have
the whole world on a plate\\
219 - - Hey, nice shot.
- Thanks.\\
220 - - You want to play?
- I don't know.\\
221 - Okay, why not?\\
222 - Look, game's to 21.
I'll take it out first.\\
223 - Have you been practicing?\\
224 - Well,\\
225 - a little.\\
226 - My goodness, what a super shot.\\
227 - Donna, what are you doing?\\
228 - I'm\\
229 - losing to you,
you big, strong grizzly bear.\\
230 - Donna, you're intentionally
throwing the game.\\
231 - - I'm throwing the game?
- Donna!\\
232 - I didn't want you to feel bad
about losing to a girl again.\\
233 - Well, thanks, 'cause being
pitied is so much better.\\
234 - God, I can't believe
you care about this.\\
235 - All I did was beat you
at a few lousy games.\\
236 - A few? No, two. Try two
lousy games. Not a few. Two.\\
237 - And I don't care.
So please leave my property.\\
238 - As long as you don't care.\\
239 - God!\\
240 - Have you been standing there
the whole time?\\
241 - No, I came out to get
one of your father's tools.\\
242 - He's in there
working on my refrigerator.\\
243 - So I gather you and Donna
are going through a rough patch.\\
244 - No, Mom, we're in a school play\\
245 - about two people
who hate each other.\\
246 - Oh.
Okay, Mr. Smartmouth,\\
247 - but when you get older,
you are going to realize\\
248 - that it's pretty silly to get upset
about losing a game to your girlfriend.\\
249 - You know what? I don't
want to talk to you about this.\\
250 - Well, you know what? I don't
want to talk to you about this.\\
251 - But I will tell you one thing.\\
252 - Your father and I have played
many games over the years,\\
253 - and we never kept score
and we always had fun.\\
254 - Now what did I
come out here for?\\
255 - Oh.\\
256 - Your father's
fixing my refrigerator.\\
257 - Red, honey,
forget the refrigerator.\\
258 - There's something wrong
with the garage door.\\
259 - Michael.\\
260 - We need to talk.\\
261 - And I am over here.\\
262 - Oh God. What am I gonna do?\\
263 - Well, you could, and I know
this is a radical suggestion,\\
264 - but be a man?\\
265 - You're right, Hyde.\\
266 - No more excuses.\\
267 - She will crush him, yes?\\
268 - Like the spirit of
your Mayan forefathers.\\
269 - My forefathers were not Mayan.\\
270 - Like anyone cares.\\
271 - So, Michael.\\
272 - So, Jackie.\\
273 - I didn't mean to make you
hang up on me.\\
274 - I'm sorry.
It will never happen again.\\
275 - That's okay. You were
obviously under a bad influence.\\
276 - Yeah.\\
277 - I'm thirsty.
Michael, get me a pop.\\
278 - Oh, yeah.\\
279 - I'm sorry. I remember saying,
be a man, not be a wuss.\\
280 - I am ashamed to know you.\\
281 - Uh-huh.\\
282 - Uh-huh.\\
283 - All right, all those who
are getting some, hands up.\\
284 - Anybody else?\\
285 - Getting some? Hyde? Fez?\\
286 - Yeah.\\
287 - What are you doing?\\
288 - Oh, just shooting some hoops,
waiting for an apology.\\
289 - Well, when you think of
one, I'll be glad to hear it.\\
290 - Okay, look,\\
291 - we're both acting like jerks.
I'm sorry.\\
292 - Yeah, I'm sorry, too.\\
293 - You know, maybe we shouldn't
play basketball anymore.\\
294 - Or any games, for that matter.\\
295 - Yeah, maybe.\\
296 - End of an era, huh?\\
297 - Hey, remember when we were 8\\
298 - and I beat you at wrestling?\\
299 - That was fun.\\
300 - Donna, you sat on my chest
and made me eat a clump of dirt.\\
301 - - All right, screw it. You want to just play?
- Yeah, I do.\\
302 - Hey, you're not going to make me
eat a clump of dirt again, are you?\\
303 - We'll see.\\
304 - Forman has the ball. He
fakes left, he blows by Pinciotti.\\
305 - Pinciotti leaps on his back!\\
306 - What do you want?\\
307 - - Give me the ball!
- What do you want?\\
308 - You want it? You want it?
You want some of this?\\
309 - Okay, foul?\\
310 - So now suddenly we're
calling every little thing?\\
311 - - What are you doing?
- Reaching for a clump of dirt.\\
312 - No. Don't.\\
313 - - Must reach clump of dirt.
- Not while I still breathe.\\
314 - - What?
- Nothing.\\
315 - Donna!\\
316 - You gotta go.\\
317 - - That's my dad.
- Right.\\
318 - - See you.
- Bye.\\
319 - - Hey, wait. Who won?
- I wasn't keeping score.\\
320 - Cool. Me, neither.\\
321 - Well, that was pretty sad, Eric.\\
322 - What?\\
323 - Come on, I'm going to teach
you how to play basketball.\\
324 - We got four hours
till your bedtime,\\
325 - and we are gonna
drill, drill, drill.\\
326 - But I thought that
Mom needed your help.\\
327 - I can't hear you,
Eric, I'm ironing.\\
328 - We'll start you off
with 100 squat thrusts.\\
329 - - Dad, we don't even
know who won.
- She did. Now hit it.\\
330 - One.\\
331 - Two.\\
332 - Three.\\
333 - Four.\\
334 - 98.\\
335 - 99.\\
336 - 100.\\
337 - Okay. Let's play.\\
338 - So Barbra Streisand
became this huge star, right?\\
339 - But Kris Kristofferson
could not take it anymore,\\
340 - so he drinks and drinks
and crashes his car.\\
341 - Isn't that romantic?\\
342 - Say, "Yes, it is."\\
343 - Yes, it is.\\
344 - Oh, I just love romantic
movies, don't you?\\
345 - "Yes, I do."\\
346 - Yes, I do.\\
347 - You know what would be a
good romantic scene in a movie?\\
348 - That night we had by the reservoir
when we went skinny-dipping.\\
349 - Remember?\\
350 - "No, describe it to me."\\
351 - No, describe it to me.\\
352 - Michael, you're so bad.\\
353 - Okay, the water was really cold,\\
354 - so when I dove in,
well, you know.\\
355 - No, I don't know.\\
356 - Michael!\\
357 - - Um, Dad,
about this table...
- Eric.\\
358 - What about the table?\\
359 - Just that it is
so darn great, Red.\\
360 - I think I ought to
shave down the legs.\\
361 - No, that would
just ruin it, Red.\\
362 - For God's sakes, I know
how to cut the legs off a table.\\
363 - You're telling me.\\
364 - What was that?\\
365 - Nothing, sir.
\subsection {Episode 05: Eric's Burger Job}
1 - Ooh. I just want to hear the
guitar solo one more time.\\
2 - Not again.
Use the headphones.\\
3 - Good. Now, wrap the cord
around your neck.\\
4 - Would you guys respect me
if I worked in the town dump?\\
5 - The town dump? No.\\
6 - Now, the state dump...\\
7 - Why are you looking for a job?\\
8 - Everything costs money.
Gas, clothes,\\
9 - fun.\\
10 - Dates. Dates cost money.\\
11 - No, Kelso, that is prostitution.\\
12 - Dating is prostitution, man.\\
13 - Only you don't always get
what you pay for.\\
14 - Said the man who's
never had a girlfriend.\\
15 - What, you guys don't
remember Esther, the biker chick?\\
16 - Hey, whatever happened to her?\\
17 - She's dating my uncle.\\
18 - Well, I'm going home for dinner.\\
19 - Oh, by the way, Mom and Dad
are going to the Playboy Club\\
20 - at Lake Geneva this weekend.\\
21 - Do you guys want souvenirs?\\
22 - - Ooh, ashtrays.
- A woman.\\
23 - Your parents are
going to be out of town?\\
24 - - Really?
- Yeah.\\
25 - I mean, I'll be babysitting
my sister Tina all weekend.\\
26 - Just me. Alone.\\
27 - Watching TV.\\
28 - I might order a pizza.\\
29 - I got an idea!\\
30 - We'll have a party at Donna's.
A toga party!\\
31 - Michael! Michael!\\
32 - Maybe Donna doesn't want to
throw a party.\\
33 - Maybe she wants to be alone.\\
34 - Yeah, just me, alone.\\
35 - If someone happens to stop by,
that'd be pretty cool.\\
36 - So we're on.
I'll bring the beer!\\
37 - Donna, I have never been to
an American party. May I come?\\
38 - Uh, yeah, I don't care.\\
39 - Uh, so, uh, Eric, are
you gonna be there?\\
40 - - What? Yeah. Sounds fun.
- Cool. Catch you guys later.\\
41 - Whoo-hoo-hoo!\\
42 - Party at Donna's.\\
43 - You are both so stupid.\\
44 - Ow! Why?\\
45 - This is a first.
I actually agree with Jackie.\\
46 - What? You're
saying that I'm stupid?\\
47 - Donna just put on the full court
press, man, and you dropped the ball.\\
48 - What are you talking about?\\
49 - All she said was that she'd be
alone Saturday night with a pizza.\\
50 - Oh, God, I'm so stupid.\\
51 - Hanging out\\
52 - Down the street\\
53 - The same old thing\\
54 - We did last week\\
55 - Not a thing to do\\
56 - But talk to you\\
57 - Whoa, yeah\\
58 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
59 - So, Dad, the guys and I are
thinking about getting jobs.\\
60 - No, no, no.
You have a job.\\
61 - It's your job
to get good grades,\\
62 - go to college,
graduate and leave me.\\
63 - Kitty, when I was his age,
I worked in a slaughterhouse.\\
64 - It was a good experience.
I learned how to use a hammer.\\
65 - Uh, the new Fatso Burger's
hiring people.\\
66 - Jackie's dad owns it. I
guess I could get a job there.\\
67 - There is plenty of time
later to get a job\\
68 - to grind the joy
out of your life.\\
69 - It's never too early.
But let me tell you something.\\
70 - Work is not about fun.
It's about work.\\
71 - It's about seeing how much crap
you can take from the boss-man.\\
72 - And then taking some more.\\
73 - And remember...
Hey, look at me.\\
74 - Only quitters quit.\\
75 - So, can I work?\\
76 - Well, we're sure as hell
gonna find out, now, aren't we?\\
77 - So, big party Saturday night.\\
78 - Whoopee.\\
79 - I can't believe Forman missed
all of those signals.\\
80 - What signals?\\
81 - Oh, no. Poor me,\\
82 - all alone in my big house.\\
83 - Just me and my nightie.\\
84 - If only there was some
scrawny little neighbor boy here.\\
85 - He's not scrawny.\\
86 - - You know,
why am I even talking to you?
- I'm all you got.\\
87 - Oh, my God.
So everybody knows?\\
88 - I'm afraid so.\\
89 - I just wanted to spend
some time with him alone,\\
90 - and now I can't.\\
91 - How does that make you feel?\\
92 - Frustrated.
It's frustrating as hell.\\
93 - I mean, I really
put myself out there.\\
94 - I see. And do you have trouble
sleeping at night?\\
95 - Sometimes, yeah, I do.\\
96 - Do you think you'd sleep better\\
97 - if you had a scrawny little
neighbor boy up next to you?\\
98 - Okay, let's hear it.\\
99 - - Hello,
my name is Eric Forman.
- No, no, no, no.\\
100 - Not with a loose hand. Firm.\\
101 - Not like a fish. Again.\\
102 - - Hello, my name...
- No. Step into it.\\
103 - - Stand up straight.
- Straight up
and hold the fish.\\
104 - - Don't be a smartmouth.
- Right. No smartmouth.\\
105 - Hello, my name is Eric Forman.\\
106 - And?\\
107 - And...\\
108 - Oh, oh, oh, um,\\
109 - tell them about your
junior achievement experience.\\
110 - They could give
a rat's ass about that.\\
111 - Okay, show them your honorable
mention from the science fair.\\
112 - - Again?
- Right, rat's ass.\\
113 - Don't slouch.\\
114 - Wouldn't that fall under the
"stand up straight" category?\\
115 - See? That's a smartmouth.\\
116 - You're fired, Mr. Smartmouth.\\
117 - See? That's how that works.\\
118 - First of all, people who
work at Fatso Burger are special.\\
119 - Now, I know you're looking
at me and wondering,\\
120 - "How do I get
where Ricky is?"\\
121 - Well, if you work hard,
pay attention,\\
122 - and use the proper
finger-release technique\\
123 - on the slant cup dispenser,
you could be me.\\
124 - Now, let's get started.\\
125 - Why do you want
a career at Fatso Burger?\\
126 - I just think it will be
a wonderful experience.\\
127 - My girlfriend's dad owns it.\\
128 - I love the uniforms.\\
129 - To unionize the workers, man.\\
130 - Tell me, what do you consider
your best quality?\\
131 - I'm a real people person.\\
132 - I don't answer stupid questions.\\
133 - I speak Dutch.\\
134 - My eyes.\\
135 - Oh, and I guess my butt, too.\\
136 - Name something about yourself
that you consider to be a weakness.\\
137 - I allow people
to boss me around.\\
138 - I love chocolate.\\
139 - I'm brutally honest. Pinhead.\\
140 - Um...\\
141 - - Where do you see
yourself in five years?
- Fatso Burger.\\
142 - Covered in gold chains.\\
143 - Rock star.
Or, no, movie star.\\
144 - No, yeah, rock star.\\
145 - Prison.\\
146 - Well, I'd like to thank you
all very much for coming in.\\
147 - Eric, welcome to
the Fatso Burger family.\\
148 - Oh, yeah!\\
149 - - Oh, Daddy. I'm so sad.
- Why, kitten?\\
150 - Because Fatso Burger
hired Eric instead of Michael.\\
151 - - I know, kitten.
- Why would they
do that, Daddy?\\
152 - Let me tell you a little story
about Doofus and Diligent.\\
153 - Doofus is friendly,
but he doesn't follow directions well.\\
154 - Now, Diligent always
does his job by the book.\\
155 - This is how the book says
to do it. "Wipe left to right."\\
156 - Uh-oh. Looks like a big
order just came in.\\
157 - "Let me help, guys,"
says Diligent.\\
158 - "But wait a second.
Where's Doofus?"\\
159 - What do you know about that?\\
160 - Let's see what happens here.\\
161 - "Uh-oh, I was in such
a hurry to get back to work,\\
162 - "I almost forgot."\\
163 - Thatta boy, Diligent.\\
164 - "Hey, there, Doofus.\\
165 - "You're supposed to wash your
hands after using the facility."\\
166 - "Ha! No way, Diligent.
That's for squares."\\
167 - So Michael's a Doofus?\\
168 - And how.\\
169 - We expect you to be responsible
when we're out of town.\\
170 - - No parties.
- And I want you to be
nice to your sister.\\
171 - Don't make Tina eat dirt.
I mean it.\\
172 - And no boys.
They only want one thing,\\
173 - and it's a dirty,
dirty thing they want.\\
174 - Enough said.\\
175 - Looking sharp, Eric.\\
176 - - You gonna be
around this weekend?
- Yes, sir.\\
177 - Good. Make sure no guys are
hanging around Donna, Capisce?\\
178 - - So, I got a job.
- Yeah?\\
179 - Yeah, it seems I'm really
Fatso Burger material.\\
180 - And I really wish I
hadn't just said that.\\
181 - No, it sounded cool.\\
182 - Um...\\
183 - So, are you still coming
to the party on Saturday?\\
184 - Well, I work late on
Saturday night, but...\\
185 - I mean, if I get off early
I could, like, swing by.\\
186 - Sounds good.\\
187 - Yeah, I mean,
it might be really late,\\
188 - so, like, everyone else
might be gone.\\
189 - Well, um, you know,\\
190 - if I'm still up, I could
leave the light on\\
191 - if you want me to.\\
192 - Yeah. No, I mean, yeah,
that would be great.\\
193 - 'Cause that way, with
the light on, I couldn't... fall.\\
194 - Yeah.\\
195 - - Okay.
- Yeah.\\
196 - - Okay.
- Sounds good.\\
197 - - Okay.
- Yeah.\\
198 - Hey, Donna.\\
199 - - That light?
- Yeah.\\
200 - - Cool.
- Okay.\\
201 - Bye, Mom.\\
202 - Oh, Eric, I'm going to the
reservoir. You wanna go?\\
203 - Nope. I gotta work.\\
204 - Eric, I'm meeting everyone
at the hub. You wanna go?\\
205 - Nope. I gotta work.\\
206 - Hey, Eric, I'm going to see
a movie. You wanna go?\\
207 - Nope. I gotta work.\\
208 - Eric, I just got this new
bikini, but I think it's too small.\\
209 - - Could I model it for you?
- Nope.\\
210 - I gotta work.\\
211 - Hey, how's that
mopping coming along?\\
212 - Well, I'm just happy to be
part of the Fatso Burger family.\\
213 - You dumb ass.\\
214 - Hear, hear, my
minimum-waged friend,\\
215 - I demand service.\\
216 - Welcome to Fatso Burger.
How may I serve you?\\
217 - That is so sad, burger boy.\\
218 - You know, Jackie,
I've been wracking my brain\\
219 - trying to figure out
why this guy didn't hire me.\\
220 - Michael, I am so tired of
hearing that. You still have me.\\
221 - - You know what
I think it is?
- What?\\
222 - I'm great-looking,
and he's jealous.\\
223 - I'm telling you, Jackie,
this body is a curse.\\
224 - Besides, if you worked here,\\
225 - you couldn't see me
whenever I wanted you to.\\
226 - Lover.\\
227 - Oh, yeah!\\
228 - Please stop touching each other.\\
229 - It gives me needs.\\
230 - Are you ready to rock and roll?\\
231 - Toga!\\
232 - Hey, man, nice dress.\\
233 - You brought three beers,
meathead?\\
234 - We'll share.\\
235 - Here's to our wasted youth, huh?\\
236 - Party.\\
237 - - Hey, Fez.
- Good evening, Donna.\\
238 - Which of these ladies are easy?\\
239 - Donna, some of your creepy
friends are using Dad's stereo.\\
240 - You guys, no one's
allowed in the house!\\
241 - Hello, pretty lady.\\
242 - Hi!\\
243 - She's not a pretty lady,
she's my sister, and she's 14.\\
244 - - You know, in my country...
- It's illegal here.\\
245 - Oh, I see.\\
246 - Michael, you and I need to talk.\\
247 - Inside.\\
248 - Okay.\\
249 - I'm miserable.
This party sucks.\\
250 - You know what'll
make you feel better?\\
251 - A scrawny little neighbor boy.\\
252 - Why don't you take off, go
see him, I'll watch the kids, huh?\\
253 - Yeah. Thanks, Hyde.\\
254 - You're welcome.\\
255 - Welcome to Fatso Burger.
How may I serve you?\\
256 - - Honey, it's me.
- I know. I have to say that.\\
257 - Oh. Oh, Okay.\\
258 - Well, I was on a break
from the hospital,\\
259 - so I thought I'd bring you
some nice, hot soup.\\
260 - Oh.\\
261 - Oyster crackers.\\
262 - Oh, thank God, something to eat.\\
263 - - So, how's it going?
- It's great.\\
264 - - So, how's it going?
- It's terrible.\\
265 - - Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.\\
266 - I'm exhausted, I'm
behind on all my homework\\
267 - and I think this polyester
uniform is giving me a body rash.\\
268 - Oh, oh, um, I swept
the driveway for you.\\
269 - Oh! Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.
I forgot.\\
270 - That's okay. You know what?
Here, I'll do this.\\
271 - You sit down and
you eat your soup.\\
272 - You know,\\
273 - Eric, if you want to quit, your father
and I will completely understand.\\
274 - Did Dad tell you that?\\
275 - Well, you leave
your father to me.\\
276 - You just worry about you.\\
277 - Hey, Forman.
Who said you were on break?\\
278 - - I did.
- And who are you?\\
279 - - I'm his mother.
- Good enough, then.\\
280 - Michael, sit.
We need to talk.\\
281 - Whoa!\\
282 - Ahoy, Jackie.
Welcome aboard the USS Kelso.\\
283 - You know, sometimes I'm beginning
to think you're a real screw-up.\\
284 - You see, one day, I want a house
and kids, and maybe a chandelier.\\
285 - And if you can't give me
those things, Michael,\\
286 - then this is all
a big waste of time.\\
287 - You just...
You gotta try harder.\\
288 - Wait, Michael,
something feels wet.\\
289 - "Dear Penthouse."\\
290 - No, no! You
popped the waterbed.\\
291 - It must've been my roach clip.\\
292 - Jackie, maybe they won't notice.\\
293 - I am in love with a Doofus!\\
294 - Hey.\\
295 - Donna?\\
296 - Oh, uh, welcome to Fatso
Burger, how... Screw it.\\
297 - - What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was bored.\\
298 - Really? You left your
own party to come see me?\\
299 - It's not much of
a party without you there.\\
300 - - You're so queer.
- Shut up.\\
301 - Um, Eric, the whole
reason I told you\\
302 - my parents were going away
was so we could hang.\\
303 - Together.\\
304 - - You know, alone.
- Yeah.\\
305 - I know, it's just, uh...\\
306 - So, um...\\
307 - Look, Donna, I'm sorry, okay?\\
308 - I would love to come over,
but this is my job.\\
309 - And, work isn't fun, you know?\\
310 - It's work.\\
311 - And only quitters quit.\\
312 - Well, as long as you know
what's important.\\
313 - I'll, um, see you around.\\
314 - Well, what do you know,
Kelso? We're out of beer.\\
315 - You know what?\\
316 - Forman's old man's
got a fridge in the garage,\\
317 - and I know he's got beer in it.\\
318 - It was his idea.\\
319 - Remind me to kick your ass.\\
320 - Uh, hey, Red.\\
321 - Um, uh, is Forman around?\\
322 - Well, he sure as hell
is not inside that fridge.\\
323 - Mr. Pinciotti, you're home.\\
324 - Good.\\
325 - Yeah, came back early.\\
326 - Yeah, missed the kids too much.\\
327 - What're you doing here?\\
328 - Oh, uh, I was just
coming home from work,\\
329 - and I noticed that someone
left your porch light on.\\
330 - You can't even see
that from your house.\\
331 - - Good eye.
- Thank you.\\
332 - You know, Eric,
that's what I like about you.\\
333 - I ask you to look out for
Donna, and here you are\\
334 - in the middle of the night
hanging around the back door\\
335 - doing your job.\\
336 - You're a good guy, Eric. I don't
care what they say about you.\\
337 - Ha! Gotcha.\\
338 - Goodnight now.\\
339 - Okay, well, I was just gonna...\\
340 - - Yeah, there you go.
- Okay.\\
341 - Goodnight then.\\
342 - Goodnight, Eric.\\
343 - - Dad.
- Eric.\\
344 - - Dad, I'm quitting my job.
- You're quitting?\\
345 - Yeah, I'm quitting.\\
346 - I'm irresponsible,
I'm a quitter,\\
347 - and I couldn't kill
a cow with a hammer.\\
348 - So what do you say to that?\\
349 - Everybody quits
their first job, Eric.\\
350 - It's no big deal.\\
351 - What?\\
352 - That's it?\\
353 - I gotta say, Dad, I'm a
little disappointed here.\\
354 - - I mean, it wasn't
a man's job anyway.
- Red.\\
355 - Well, come on, Kitty,
it was a hair-net,\\
356 - name-tag, nothing kind of a job.\\
357 - Now, that's more like it.\\
358 - It's just as well. It was cutting
into your chores anyway.\\
359 - You did a half-assed job
sweeping the driveway.\\
360 - I thought he did
a wonderful job.\\
361 - It didn't look wonderful to me.\\
362 - Okay, then.\\
363 - Sweep it yourself.\\
364 - Hey, hey, hey, Forman.
Where's that big Fatso smile?\\
365 - Ricky, how did you start
working at Fatso Burger?\\
366 - Great story.\\
367 - I was gonna go to college,\\
368 - but they made me
Assistant Manager,\\
369 - just threw the money at me,
so I never got to go.\\
370 - But now I'm my own boss.\\
371 - Well, that's not true.
I answer to a lot of people.\\
372 - Okay. I quit now.\\
373 - - Oh, yeah,
I certainly would.
- Yeah.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Keg}
1 - Will this day ever end?\\
2 - Yesterday did.
But today's Friday. So, no.\\
3 - Oh, God,
it's Destroy and Giveback.\\
4 - - Yeah,
why do they call them that?
- You're about to find out.\\
5 - Hey, Foreplay.\\
6 - Ohh!\\
7 - I believe this is yours.\\
8 - - You broke his pencil. That was great!
- And you gave it back.\\
9 - All right, enough horseplay.\\
10 - Pipe down.\\
11 - I said, pipe down!\\
12 - Now, I've got an announcement
before study hall.\\
13 - Whoever burned their initials
in the football field,\\
14 - I hope you're happy
with yourself, punk.\\
15 - There will be no football practice
today until we've reseeded.\\
16 - And I've watched that team,
I'm not impressed, boy.\\
17 - Let me tell you, they need
all the practice they can get.\\
18 - On a happier not...\\
19 - Eric?\\
20 - Donna?\\
21 - Do you need something to do?\\
22 - Actually, we need to be excused.\\
23 - Donna and I are taking
pictures for the yearbook.\\
24 - Yeah.\\
25 - If you say so, Eric.\\
26 - You wouldn't lie.\\
27 - Well, I might.\\
28 - This is great.
Eric Forman skips class.\\
29 - Yeah, well,
danger is my middle name.\\
30 - Why are we moving?\\
31 - - Mommy.
- What are you
guys doing in here?\\
32 - What are you guys doing in here?\\
33 - I cut class.\\
34 - Yeah, right. So was there
like a fire drill or something?\\
35 - No, look, I do bad things.\\
36 - Look, I've ditched class before.\\
37 - Is Opie getting angry?\\
38 - What did I tell you
about calling me Opie?\\
39 - Opie, look out for that keg
in the middle of the road!\\
40 - Wow!\\
41 - It is a keg.\\
42 - Of beer.\\
43 - It must be a sign.\\
44 - Of beer.\\
45 - Oh, that's it.
I'm cutting class every day.\\
46 - Hanging out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - Whoa, yeah\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - How did you find it?\\
55 - We were driving down the
road, man, and there she was.\\
56 - Oh, it was the beer
in the headlights.\\
57 - That is my first American joke.\\
58 - Wow. How often do you find
a mysterious keg of free beer?\\
59 - Only once in a while.\\
60 - You're right, Forman.
Man, you are absolutely right.\\
61 - When God gives you a keg,
you've gotta...\\
62 - Kill a virgin.\\
63 - No.\\
64 - Throw a party.\\
65 - Whoa!\\
66 - Go for it, Eric.\\
67 - Yeah, we'll throw a party.
Gonna charge 2 bucks a head.\\
68 - 2 bucks a head.\\
69 - A keg is equivalent to
seven cases, that's 168 beers.\\
70 - If we each drink
three beers a piece...\\
71 - - No way. Sophomores
gonna drink one, maybe.
- True.\\
72 - Yeah. And the freshman,
he's gonna drink a half.\\
73 - So that averages out
to 1.5 beers per person,\\
74 - which means we can invite
112 people. That's 224 bucks.\\
75 - Cash.\\
76 - Which is decent.\\
77 - Okay, grab some ice out of
the deep freeze, I'll grab the tub.\\
78 - That is one sweet mama.\\
79 - Yeah.\\
80 - Hey, gang.\\
81 - Oh, oh, don't mind me.\\
82 - Just came down to do
an emergency presoak\\
83 - on my nurse's uniform.\\
84 - You remember Mr. Wilbur,
the fireman?\\
85 - Well, he came in today
with a sebaceous cyst,\\
86 - which is a, um,
a pocket of fluid\\
87 - that's kind of like a pussy
bath oil bead under the skin.\\
88 - And you think it's solid,
but if you take an instrument\\
89 - and you pierce the core\\
90 - and then you apply pressure
with your thumb...\\
91 - Well, hi, snicklefritz, what
are you doing with the tub?\\
92 - Oh. The tub.\\
93 - We were just working
on a class project.\\
94 - We're making a volcano.\\
95 - Snicklefritz.\\
96 - Out of ice? Well, I
think it might melt.\\
97 - You heard her.
Let's move it, gang.\\
98 - Okay, well, have fun.\\
99 - Guys, we've got to
get the keg out of here.\\
100 - Where are we having the party?\\
101 - Beats me. If you guys need me
I'll be with Jackie\\
102 - over at our
secret make-out place.\\
103 - - Secret make-out place.
- It's this vacant house
over on Sherman.\\
104 - I mean, this place is great.
It's totally private.\\
105 - I mean, you can get away
with about anything there.\\
106 - So, if you guys find a place
for that keg, let me know.\\
107 - I've got an idea!\\
108 - That's a Sylvania,
isn't it, Red?\\
109 - You didn't buy that
in my store, did you?\\
110 - No, Bob,
I got a good deal on it.\\
111 - You got me.\\
112 - - You got me, Red.
- Yeah.\\
113 - Well, I am just so excited.\\
114 - Rich Man, Poor Man.\\
115 - I missed the first episode.\\
116 - Here's the irony
of the show, Kitty.\\
117 - The rich, safe guy is boring.\\
118 - It's the poor, rugged one, played
by the very talented Nick Nolte\\
119 - who is so exciting.\\
120 - Well, super.\\
121 - Now, who would like a drink?\\
122 - Ooh!\\
123 - Let's do daiquiris.\\
124 - Ooh, I don't know
if we have enough ice.\\
125 - Eric took a whole tub full.\\
126 - He took a tub of ice?\\
127 - Oh, the kids are
making a volcano.\\
128 - Right, that's why Donna left
with all the plastic cups.\\
129 - Plastic cups?\\
130 - Sure, plastic volcano cups.\\
131 - If I didn't know better, I'd say
they were having a kegger.\\
132 - Oh, jeez!\\
133 - Let's go, Bob.\\
134 - Ooh, Rich Man, Poor Man,
I love it.\\
135 - I just hope I don't
get too emotional.\\
136 - Oh, so do I.\\
137 - Those kids could be anywhere.\\
138 - Needle, meet haystack.\\
139 - Look, they left the house
in a wood-paneled ocean liner.\\
140 - We should be able to find them.\\
141 - Yep, it's a real
asphalt jungle out here.\\
142 - The sun goes down,
the rats come out.\\
143 - I lost my mailbox last year.\\
144 - Oh, yeah.
You know what it is.\\
145 - The evil spilling over
from Sheboygan.\\
146 - How many stories do you suppose
there are in this naked burg?\\
147 - Eight, Bob.
There are eight.\\
148 - Michael, this is our
secret make-out place.\\
149 - I did not swipe the key from
my mother's real estate office\\
150 - so that you could have a party.\\
151 - I know it's like a bonus.\\
152 - And I'm doing it for you, baby.\\
153 - Okay.\\
154 - Empty pool,
empty house, full keg.\\
155 - You sure know how to
show a girl a good time.\\
156 - Yeah, well, I don't color
outside the lines often,\\
157 - but when I do,
jump back, Loretta.\\
158 - I don't care when you ate,
Fez, get in the pool now.\\
159 - If I get a cramp,
it will be on your head.\\
160 - Okay.\\
161 - Hurry up and drink your keg.\\
162 - Hurry up and drink a keg?\\
163 - Jackie, will you just
mellow out?\\
164 - I mean, this rules. We've got a keg,
and soon everybody's gonna be here.\\
165 - - Everybody?
- Everybody who matters.\\
166 - And for the first time,
Jackie, that includes you.\\
167 - No, get away from me!\\
168 - You heard her, let's drink beer.\\
169 - - Me first.
- No way, I spotted it.\\
170 - No, I saw it, too,
I just didn't say anything.\\
171 - You saw a keg and you
didn't say anything?\\
172 - Back of the line.\\
173 - All right, how do you
get the beer out?\\
174 - - Through the tap.
- What tap?\\
175 - No!\\
176 - Okay, we really need a tap here.\\
177 - I got my Swiss Army knife.\\
178 - Oh, great, we can
whittle the beer out.\\
179 - All right, look, they sell
taps at the liquor store.\\
180 - Yeah, and who's got
the money to buy it, huh?\\
181 - Why would I bring money to our
secret make-out place, Michael?\\
182 - Okay, I've got my gas money.\\
183 - No, Eric, we're not going to
take your gas money.\\
184 - Hey, it doesn't matter.\\
185 - By the end of the night,
we'll have made over $200.\\
186 - Yeah.\\
187 - Michael, how are we
gonna make $200?\\
188 - I don't know.\\
189 - Hey, who's buying the tap?\\
190 - You buy, I'll fly.\\
191 - No, Michael, you are...
Michael, come back here!\\
192 - Michael, I'm talking to you.
Michael!\\
193 - Welcome to the pool.
I am your host, Fez.\\
194 - $2, please.\\
195 - What is going on?\\
196 - I didn't want to
tell you before, Jackie,\\
197 - but we've taken it upon
ourselves to help your mom\\
198 - show off the house
at 2 bucks a head.\\
199 - He's lying to Jackie, man.\\
200 - I lie to Jackie.\\
201 - You know, it seems to me that
the scrawny little neighbor boy\\
202 - is willing to engage
in criminal acts\\
203 - for that saucy
redhead next door.\\
204 - Shut up. How do you know he's
not doing it to impress his friends?\\
205 - You know, peer pressure.\\
206 - Because his
friends aren't saucy.\\
207 - Kelso's saucy.\\
208 - Kelso? Please,
I'm saucier than Kelso.\\
209 - Then the door
burst open wide\\
210 - And my daddy stepped inside\\
211 - And he kissed my mama's face\\
212 - And he brushed
her tears away\\
213 - The night Chicago died\\
214 - Would you turn
that damn thing off?\\
215 - Keep your eyes peeled
for that Vista Cruiser.\\
216 - Okey dokey.\\
217 - Sorry.\\
218 - Hey. See you got
some new steins here.\\
219 - Hi, I'm 25.\\
220 - I know I look young, but my
dad asked me to come down here\\
221 - and pick up a tap for his keg.\\
222 - And, uh, he's 43, so we're
both legal. No problem there.\\
223 - Uh, I'm not gonna be
drinking the beer or anything.\\
224 - 'Cause I don't believe in it,
but no offense to you.\\
225 - - I think selling
liquor is a great thing.
- Yeah, here you go.\\
226 - Yeah.\\
227 - - 'Cause I'm 25, right?
- 'Cause you got money.\\
228 - Yeah, but I am 25.\\
229 - Don't need to be.
Can't drink a tap.\\
230 - No, I can prove it you. I
got my IDs out in the wallet.\\
231 - Happens all the time.
Take care.\\
232 - - Yeah, but I...
- Leave, now.\\
233 - Yeah.\\
234 - Kelshmo. Whatcha got there?\\
235 - Boy, that was really funny,\\
236 - that thing you did with my
name, Kelshmo. I gotta go.\\
237 - Oh! Aww.\\
238 - I believe this is yours.\\
239 - - You broke his thing.
- And you gave it back.\\
240 - - Yeah, that was great!
- Yeah!\\
241 - So you see what I'm saying
about the poor man?\\
242 - Yes, you have made your point.
Many times.\\
243 - He's a bad boy,
he's had some rough breaks,\\
244 - but he isn't bad in his soul.\\
245 - Okay. Okay.
Enough daiquiris for you.\\
246 - Kitty, what do you
look for in a man?\\
247 - Oh, well, I'm married.\\
248 - I'm kind of through looking.\\
249 - Kitty, you can always look.
It helps you to fantasize.\\
250 - Like. Some nights, I'm doing
the news with Walter Cronkite.\\
251 - Okay, I'm just...\\
252 - You know, I'm gonna
finish your daiquiri.\\
253 - - It's broken.
- I got duct tape.\\
254 - Duct tape? Do you know how
much pressure runs through that tap?\\
255 - I got a whole roll of duct tape.\\
256 - I can't work like this.\\
257 - Forman, you need to get
your dad's tap now.\\
258 - My dad doesn't have a tap.\\
259 - Red's got
bicentennial swizzle sticks.\\
260 - He's got fake lemons
with real lemon juice.\\
261 - He's got toothpicks
shaped like swords.\\
262 - Red Forman is a cocktail dad.\\
263 - And cocktail dads
have beer taps.\\
264 - Yeah, come on, Eric,
we never ask you for anything.\\
265 - You guys ask me for everything.\\
266 - So, what's one more thing?\\
267 - No, forget it. I've done
enough today already.\\
268 - Count me out.\\
269 - Hey, Kelshmo,
what, your tap is broken?\\
270 - Why'd you do something stupid
like buy a stupid, broken tap?\\
271 - What are you, stupid?\\
272 - It wasn't broken
until you broke it.\\
273 - Oh, man.\\
274 - Don't beat yourself up.
You had no way of knowing.\\
275 - - Anyways, we gave it back.
- Yeah, broken.\\
276 - Hey, lay off him, all right?
He feels bad enough already.\\
277 - - Oh, he should
because he's a moron.
- What did you say?\\
278 - I said that you're both morons.\\
279 - What are you going to do?
You're gonna beat me up?\\
280 - What, you weigh 400 pounds
together? It doesn't matter.\\
281 - The fact is that the tap is
broken, and it's your fault.\\
282 - Morons!\\
283 - You are so rude.\\
284 - Give us our 4 bucks back.\\
285 - Okay. Fez.\\
286 - Familiar?\\
287 - Wow, Eric,
you just tore their money.\\
288 - And gave it back.
That was great.\\
289 - That was awesome.\\
290 - But enough of
this levity, wench!\\
291 - We came here to have a party,\\
292 - and as God is my witness,
there will be a party.\\
293 - Nope, I haven't sold
a keg all day,\\
294 - but a young guy did
come in for a tap.\\
295 - Young guy, huh?\\
296 - Look, they got
pina colada in a can.\\
297 - Bob, we're doing something here.\\
298 - All right.\\
299 - You know, I might have heard
something about a party.\\
300 - Can't recall.\\
301 - Maybe Andrew Jackson
could remind me.\\
302 - Andrew Jackson, huh?\\
303 - He's not in.\\
304 - But Abe Lincoln's hanging out
with the Washington twins.\\
305 - Would they have any knowledge
of the festivities?\\
306 - So, a real wisenheimer, huh?\\
307 - Well, let's see
how smart you are\\
308 - when I snap off your head!\\
309 - Okay, okay, man.\\
310 - They said something about
a vacant house on Sherman.\\
311 - I know that place. It's the
vacant house on Sherman.\\
312 - Good work, Starsky.\\
313 - Let's roll.\\
314 - Everybody in the deep end!\\
315 - My mother is showing the house!\\
316 - - Now?
- People work.\\
317 - Okay,
quiet down, everybody.\\
318 - The deck is new,\\
319 - and this lovely tile walkway
leads directly to the pool.\\
320 - Which is filled with
some of the local kids.\\
321 - Heavily Caucasian.\\
322 - It's a nice neighborhood.\\
323 - Sometimes Bob
pretends he's poor.\\
324 - I call him Buster.\\
325 - He knocks on the door,
and I answer it in my teddy.\\
326 - And he says, "Does the rich lady
need any help around the house?"\\
327 - And I say, "I know a something
that needs attending to\\
328 - "in the bedroom."\\
329 - I'll spare you the details,\\
330 - but it ends in whoopee.\\
331 - You know, this is as
much fun to make\\
332 - as it is to eat.\\
333 - You know, speaking of which,\\
334 - how do you get Bob
to play those games?\\
335 - I have a reward system.\\
336 - Huh?\\
337 - You know, sometimes Red
would wear a sailor's uniform.\\
338 - Really?\\
339 - Yeah, but he was in the Navy.\\
340 - Ooh, kitty.\\
341 - Does he still have
his sailor's uniform?\\
342 - Oh, no.\\
343 - Just has the hat.\\
344 - I stole my dad's tap.\\
345 - Back from those thieves.\\
346 - We were worried sick.\\
347 - You had us driving
all over town.\\
348 - We missed Rich Man, Poor Man.\\
349 - - Excuse us, Red.
- What are you doing?\\
350 - - We're just gonna
grab this keg...
- Get out of here!\\
351 - - We're not finished with this.
- Neither are we.\\
352 - Now, you take her home and
you wait for me. That's an order.\\
353 - Ditto.\\
354 - Come here.\\
355 - I can't stay mad at you
with that cute face.\\
356 - Get your ugly butt home.\\
357 - My dad's gonna kill me.\\
358 - You're always saying that.\\
359 - Yeah, well, this time
he's gonna kill me.\\
360 - I mean, I cut class,\\
361 - I trespassed, I had stolen beer\\
362 - and then I swung into a pool
full of cops on a garden hose\\
363 - carrying my dad's tap.\\
364 - Yeah, that was so cool.\\
365 - Really?\\
366 - Really.\\
367 - You looked dangerous.\\
368 - Did I mention that I
killed a guy in algebra?\\
369 - Good night, killer.\\
370 - Bring it on, Red.\\
371 - I love that boy.\\
372 - Eric's a good kid.\\
373 - And that Donna's
real sweet, too.\\
374 - Man, that Donna's real hot.\\
375 - - Hey, that's my daughter.
- I'm just saying that...\\
376 - You don't think
I know what you're saying?\\
377 - All right, Bob, it's time to go.\\
378 - We'll just take...\\
379 - Hey, hey, hey!
Get out of here.\\
380 - All right.\\
381 - Fine.
\subsection {Episode 07: That Disco Episode}
1 - The game is Anaconda. Big Ace.\\
2 - Eight ball. Red Lady.
Jackson. Fiver. Wild Man...\\
3 - Oh, my God, Michael,
they opened up a disco.\\
4 - Where at?\\
5 - In Kenosha.\\
6 - You can wear your
David Bowie butt-huggers.\\
7 - Michael, that would be super.\\
8 - Laugh if you want, man, but
my butt looks pretty good in those.\\
9 - Come on, are you guys crazy?
I mean, a disco? No way.\\
10 - I don't know. It might be
kind of fun to go dancing.\\
11 - Or we could go.\\
12 - I've got nothing. I fold.\\
13 - Man, if you're out,
go make some popcorn.\\
14 - Take her with you.\\
15 - What is disco?\\
16 - Disco is from hell, okay?\\
17 - And not the cool part of hell
with all the murderers...\\
18 - but the lame-ass part where
the really bad accountants live.\\
19 - Excuse me, what are you doing?\\
20 - Looking at Kelso's cards.\\
21 - That's cheating.\\
22 - Eric,
we can't find the popcorn!\\
23 - Hey, um... Donna, why don't
you take a look at my cards?\\
24 - Then you won't have
to wait for me to leave.\\
25 - No. Come on, take a look.
Tell me what I have, you cheater.\\
26 - You've got nothing.\\
27 - Yeah, but I'm gonna bluff.
So, watch out.\\
28 - Donna has stuff for Eric. Yes?\\
29 - Not stuff. Thing.\\
30 - Donna has a thing for Eric.\\
31 - Why do you have
a thing for Eric?\\
32 - He makes me laugh, he
doesn't ask me stupid questions...\\
33 - he's smart, and you know.\\
34 - No, I don't know.\\
35 - I know.\\
36 - It is because Eric is noble, and a
woman wants her first lovemaking...\\
37 - to be in the arms of
a man she can trust.\\
38 - Fez.
Yes?\\
39 - Go make popcorn.\\
40 - Hanging out\\
41 - Down the street\\
42 - The same old thing\\
43 - We did last week\\
44 - Not a thing to do\\
45 - But talk to you\\
46 - Whoa, yeah\\
47 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
48 - Dad, I want to talk to you
about my curfew on Saturday.\\
49 - We're going to
a disco in Kenosha.\\
50 - Oh, dancing in Kenosha,
that's quite a drive.\\
51 - Can I push my curfew to 2:00?\\
52 - Or 1:30?\\
53 - Or 1:00?
Done.\\
54 - So, who's going?\\
55 - Oh, Donna, I'm sure.
They're practically dating.\\
56 - Can I have some gas money?\\
57 - Dating? Since when?\\
58 - Mom, we're not dating.\\
59 - Why not? She likes you.\\
60 - Thanks, Mom.
About that gas money.\\
61 - Well, now, she's interested.
I can tell.\\
62 - And dancing is the
quickest way to a gal's heart.\\
63 - Remember, Red...\\
64 - when we used to go dancing at
the Avalon on Mackinaw island?\\
65 - Oh, Mackinaw. Now, that's quite
a drive. I'll bet the mileage is...\\
66 - Volare\\
67 - You see what you did?\\
68 - You got your mother started.\\
69 - Volare\\
70 - Man, I can't
believe you and Jackie\\
71 - are dragging
everybody to the disco.\\
72 - It's so sad.\\
73 - No, I'm just going to
meet Kenosha chicks.\\
74 - I'm breaking up with Jackie.\\
75 - Oh, get a tall chick.\\
76 - Because you and Jackie
look so silly together.\\
77 - Okay, that's all the deposit
bottles. And the aluminum cans.\\
78 - We've gotta have at
least $1.15 worth of gas.\\
79 - Come on, my dad's
got a ton of empties.\\
80 - I can't believe they're gonna\\
81 - waste all their money
on a stupid disco...\\
82 - when they could buy
a really big bag...\\
83 - Of caramels.\\
84 - Not going to
that disco, huh?\\
85 - No. Phony people
listening to crappy music\\
86 - does not sound
like my kind of time.\\
87 - You can't dance, can you?\\
88 - I can dance.\\
89 - Oh, I don't think so, pal.\\
90 - I can dance.\\
91 - Not one step.\\
92 - You're right. Not one step.\\
93 - Well, then you got
a problem, son...\\
94 - 'cause women wanna dance.\\
95 - They always wanna dance.
Always.\\
96 - Why?\\
97 - Because they can get close
and wiggle their bodies around...\\
98 - in front of a man
in a safe atmosphere.\\
99 - See, I don't really wanna
wiggle around in public.\\
100 - Well, of course not. You're a man. My
point is, you're going to have to learn.\\
101 - Otherwise, later on in life...\\
102 - you're gonna be
wiggling all by yourself.\\
103 - Now, if you want...\\
104 - I can help you out.\\
105 - Okay, now, that was good.
Okay, let's try it again.\\
106 - Okay, now, left, right, left...\\
107 - turn, and step. Okay.\\
108 - I can't keep up with
the music, Mrs. Forman.\\
109 - Now, let's
not get discouraged.\\
110 - All right. I am just
gonna turn this music off.\\
111 - Now, you follow me.\\
112 - Okay, you can do this. Okay.\\
113 - Left, right, left...\\
114 - turn and step.\\
115 - Okay. No. Look at me,
not at your feet.\\
116 - Okay, you know what now,
put your arm around me.\\
117 - A little bit lower. Put your
hand in the small of my back.\\
118 - Feel how you can guide me?\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - Okay, left...\\
121 - You're leading.\\
122 - Okay, now, tell me where
to move with your hands.\\
123 - Uh-huh. Left, right, left...\\
124 - turn, okay,
eye contact in the turn.\\
125 - Okay and dip.\\
126 - Okay, well, now,
let's just do it again.\\
127 - Hello? Anybody home? I'm
bringing back your thermos.\\
128 - Oh. Put your hand
there. Oh. That's perfect.\\
129 - You are better than Red.\\
130 - Oh, I am exhausted.
That is sweaty work.\\
131 - Mrs. Forman, I would
really appreciate it\\
132 - if maybe we didn't tell anybody
about what we're doing here.\\
133 - Oh, mum is the word.\\
134 - Tomorrow after school, okay?\\
135 - Thanks.\\
136 - And, Steven, you were good.\\
137 - Okay, I thought about it,
and I'm going to the disco.\\
138 - Just on the off chance\\
139 - they might mix up
a little rock and roll, man.\\
140 - Yeah, I have something to say.\\
141 - I went to the mall today...\\
142 - and I bought
a pair of new shoes.\\
143 - And they are
the coolest kicks in the cave.\\
144 - So, no more for Kelso.
He's toasted.\\
145 - I would like some toast
if you are making some.\\
146 - Or food of any kind would
be good. I am starving.\\
147 - Oh, I read somewhere\\
148 - there are these people
in India who fast, man.\\
149 - Yeah.\\
150 - And their minds are so advanced,\\
151 - they can actually think
themselves to death, man.\\
152 - Whoa. I hope I'm not
doing that right now.\\
153 - My mind's always doing things
that I don't even know about.\\
154 - Man, we always think of so
many brilliant things down here...\\
155 - but then later,
I can't remember any of them.\\
156 - I mean, they're brilliant, man.\\
157 - Someone go make toast right now.\\
158 - Hey, we should record
our conversation, man.\\
159 - Yeah, then we could play
it back and write it down.\\
160 - I'll bet that's how the writers
at National Lampoon do it.\\
161 - Yeah, I read somewhere that
there are these people in France.\\
162 - What do they do?\\
163 - You see, they're incredibly...\\
164 - French.\\
165 - See, that's brilliant, man.
I'm getting a tape recorder.\\
166 - Where's my toast, you idiots?\\
167 - Eric?
Yeah, Dad?\\
168 - Listen, I know you need
gas money for Saturday night.\\
169 - So, if you're willing to do a few
extra chores, I'll pay you $10.\\
170 - Sure. I can do that.\\
171 - Now I need you to
sweep the garage,\\
172 - clean the leaves out of the
gutters, get the dry cleaning\\
173 - and fix that
shelf in the pantry.\\
174 - Now run that back to me.\\
175 - Okay, fix the shelf, sweep
the garage, pick up the leaves...\\
176 - Pick up the dry cleaning.\\
177 - Yeah.\\
178 - The gutters?\\
179 - Fix the gutters.\\
180 - Clean. Clean the gutters.\\
181 - Clean out the gutters, fix
the shelf, sweep the leaves.\\
182 - The garage.\\
183 - - Fix the garage.
- Sweep it.\\
184 - Listen, I'm not gonna pay you
$10 for nothing.\\
185 - Sweep the garage, pick up
the cleaning, clean up the gutters\\
186 - fix the shelf.\\
187 - Do that, and you got
yourself gas money.\\
188 - Didn't you say
something about leaves?\\
189 - They're in the gutters.\\
190 - Right. Pick them up.
Clean them up.\\
191 - I've gotta make toast.\\
192 - Ya!\\
193 - Oh, jeez, Midge. Kitty
and that boy are at it again.\\
194 - You smell great.
What did you do?\\
195 - I took a bath.\\
196 - I was thinking of
you the whole time.\\
197 - Yeah, you know, I do the
same thing in the shower.\\
198 - What?
Nothing.\\
199 - Okay, let's take some pictures.\\
200 - I'm ready.
Steven, get in closer.\\
201 - Okay, let's all smush
together. Okay. Big smiles.\\
202 - Nice. Okay, now, girls.\\
203 - Look how pretty. Smile. Nice.\\
204 - Now, boys. So handsome.\\
205 - Okay, now. One, two...\\
206 - Hey, Mom, why don't I
take a picture of you?\\
207 - No, no, no, no.\\
208 - Okay, you'll be late. Bye now.\\
209 - You're the best.\\
210 - Oh, you go
get them, tiger.\\
211 - Kitty, I need your advice.\\
212 - Well, sure. What is it?\\
213 - I have this married friend.\\
214 - And she's about to throw
everything away\\
215 - because she's attracted
to a much younger man.\\
216 - It's Stella.
No.\\
217 - Oh, I knew that Stella
was open for business.\\
218 - It's not Stella.\\
219 - Well, do I know her?\\
220 - Yes. Very well.\\
221 - Oh, Midge.\\
222 - Does Bob know?\\
223 - Yeah. And he
doesn't know what to do.\\
224 - Kitty, I don't know what to do.\\
225 - Midge. Listen.\\
226 - I think your friend
should think about\\
227 - all the people
she's gonna hurt...\\
228 - and tell this younger man,
whoever he is, I don't wanna know...\\
229 - that it has to stop.\\
230 - Thank you.\\
231 - I just hope my
friend takes your advice.\\
232 - I'm sure your friend will.\\
233 - Hmm. Younger man?
Wonder what that's like.\\
234 - Jackie, where'd you go?\\
235 - I had to get something
for you to bite on\\
236 - 'cause I told everyone
you were having a seizure.\\
237 - When do they play
the disco music?\\
238 - This is disco music.\\
239 - No. This is samba.\\
240 - Fez, it's disco, man.
It's crap.\\
241 - Oh, I think I like this crap.\\
242 - Come, Jackie, let's get down.\\
243 - No, I think I'm a little tired.\\
244 - Don't resist me, mama.\\
245 - It's boogie time.\\
246 - I think you just lost your date.\\
247 - Yeah, it's cool 'cause
Jackie and I are history!\\
248 - She must not weigh that much.\\
249 - She touching his ass?\\
250 - Listen. Merengue.\\
251 - Fez, you're crazy.\\
252 - Wow, they are really good.\\
253 - Yeah, if you want
to dance that way.\\
254 - I would love to dance that way.\\
255 - You wanna dance?\\
256 - Sure.\\
257 - You dance.\\
258 - This is a side of
you I've never seen.\\
259 - Yeah. Actually,
you're my first dance.\\
260 - I'm your first? I'm honored.\\
261 - This is nice.\\
262 - Donna, man, I feel
like I wanna kiss you.\\
263 - You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't want.\\
264 - I'm not kidding.\\
265 - Shut up and dance.\\
266 - Fez, you're an amazing dancer.\\
267 - Actually, Jackie, you are
the reason I am amazing.\\
268 - You see, when a man dances, he
should display the woman to the room\\
269 - like a beautiful flower.\\
270 - Oh, Fez.\\
271 - Michael!\\
272 - All right, pal, that's it.\\
273 - It's you and me,
right here, right now.\\
274 - Why did you have
to interrupt us?\\
275 - Jackie is my girl, Fez.\\
276 - But you are
breaking up with her.\\
277 - Where do you
even get that stuff?\\
278 - Okay.
I'll be running away now.\\
279 - Michael!\\
280 - Michael, it's not his fault. You just
don't know how to dance with me.\\
281 - I don't know how to dance, so you
just take off with some other guy?\\
282 - I know, Michael.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.\\
283 - But all I wanted to be
was displayed like a flower.\\
284 - You know that you are my flower.\\
285 - That is so beautiful.\\
286 - Put me down.\\
287 - Oh, Michael.\\
288 - Okay, I am passing out now.\\
289 - Okay, Bob, what is it?\\
290 - Just curious.\\
291 - What's the word
on that Hyde kid?\\
292 - Steven?\\
293 - He's a little rebellious.
He just needs some direction.\\
294 - Apparently,
he's getting it, Red.\\
295 - I kind of walked
into your living room\\
296 - and he and Kitty\\
297 - were in some sort of
provocative embrace.\\
298 - I think he was putting
the moves on your wife.\\
299 - Oh, my God.\\
300 - Now I've got to kill him.\\
301 - Get your deer rifle, Bob.\\
302 - Hold on, Red.
I could've been mistaken.\\
303 - You know what you saw.
Get the damn gun.\\
304 - Maybe she was choking, you
know, on some food or something.\\
305 - I can't take that chance. What
choice do I have as a man?\\
306 - Come on, Red.
They could've been dancing.\\
307 - Jeez, I'm sure she was
teaching him dancing...\\
308 - 'cause they were all
going to that disco.\\
309 - Dancing, huh?
Yeah.\\
310 - Jeez, Bob\\
311 - that would be downright logical.\\
312 - Good thing I didn't shoot him.\\
313 - Hyde, you were
right about disco music.\\
314 - It is evil.\\
315 - Its pulsing rhythm
made me do a bad thing.\\
316 - Yeah, well, me, too.\\
317 - Kelso is my friend.
I cannot take his woman.\\
318 - You're a good guy, Fez.\\
319 - Actually, I could take
his woman, but I won't.\\
320 - Come on, I'll walk you home.
See you guys.\\
321 - See you.
Good night.\\
322 - Hey, uh, Hyde dancing.
What a surprise.\\
323 - Yeah, who knew?\\
324 - Yeah. You looked like
you were having a good time.\\
325 - Yeah, you know, disco fever.
You catch it. But I'm better now.\\
326 - Wow, what a weird night. Hey,
did you see Kelso's shoes?\\
327 - Yeah. Remember when he saw
that girl wearing the same shoes?\\
328 - Actually, that was pretty sad.\\
329 - Yeah. So...\\
330 - Hey, um, do you
recall that night\\
331 - we crossed the Rio Grande?\\
332 - What?\\
333 - I can see it in your eyes.\\
334 - What are you talking about?\\
335 - How proud you were to fight\\
336 - For freedom in this land\\
337 - Shut up. Don't.\\
338 - There was something
in the air that night\\
339 - The stars were bright\\
340 - Fernando\\
341 - I'm sorry. I hate dance music.\\
342 - Why did you go?\\
343 - I like you.\\
344 - So, you're in like with me?\\
345 - Donna, I'm in...\\
346 - I can't dance.\\
347 - You'll learn.\\
348 - There was something
in the air that night\\
349 - The stars were bright\\
350 - Donna, I really want to
kiss you again.\\
351 - Fernando\\
352 - Shut up and dance.\\
353 - They were shining
there for you and me\\
354 - And liberty, Fernando\\
355 - Though I never
thought that we could lose\\
356 - There's no regret\\
357 - If I could do
the same again\\
358 - I would, my friend
Fernando\\
359 - If I had to
do the same again\\
360 - I would,
my friend, Fernando\\
361 - I'm saying,
the earth is a farm.\\
362 - That's brilliant.\\
363 - A farm.\\
364 - A farm put here by
aliens, man. And we're the cattle.\\
365 - We're cattle.\\
366 - And the government
knows it. It's out there, man.\\
367 - What is?\\
368 - The truth.\\
369 - What are you saying?\\
370 - Out there is the truth.\\
371 - The truth is out there, man.\\
372 - That's seriously brilliant.\\
373 - See, you are all stupid.
\subsection {Episode 08: Drive-In}
1 - Yeah, that's right, 100 bags of manure.\\
2 - Yeah, the wife and I are
redoing the front lawn.\\
3 - And, uh, tell you
what, if I'm not there,\\
4 - just dump it all
on the front porch.\\
5 - Bye-bye.\\
6 - Yeah, man, Coach Jefferson
is gonna freak.\\
7 - He just shouldn't
have given me that "D."\\
8 - Oh, no. Dick Tracy
is trapped in a giant clam.\\
9 - Farewell, sweet Dick!\\
10 - A man being eaten
by a giant clam.\\
11 - Now, I'm not
Sigmund Freud, but...\\
12 - Eric.\\
13 - The Omen's playing
at the drive-in.\\
14 - You know what this means for us?\\
15 - It's make-out city.\\
16 - I really like you
as a friend, Kelso.\\
17 - Can I bring a girl?\\
18 - Yeah. Man,
it's gonna be great.\\
19 - Horror movies turn on chicks
faster than porno.\\
20 - Really? Faster than that?\\
21 - Yeah. If only somebody would
make a porno horror movie.\\
22 - Well, then there'd be
no stopping you.\\
23 - Eric.\\
24 - Is that kid from, uh,\\
25 - not America down here?\\
26 - Dad, it's Fez.\\
27 - Yeah, whatever.\\
28 - The Erdmans called
and they, they want him to...\\
29 - Go home.\\
30 - Kelso, stop saying
"porno."\\
31 - I didn't say it,
Mr. Forman. Fez did.\\
32 - You are a bitch.\\
33 - Hangin' out\\
34 - Down the street\\
35 - The same old thing\\
36 - We did last week\\
37 - Not a thing to do\\
38 - But talk to you\\
39 - Whoa, yeah\\
40 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
41 - Okay, you know
what this is, Red?\\
42 - Some lady magazine.\\
43 - It's Cosmo.\\
44 - Oh, no.\\
45 - I'm gonna tell you
something, Red.\\
46 - I just took the "how spontaneous
is your relationship?" quiz.\\
47 - And you know what?\\
48 - What?\\
49 - We got three out of 10.\\
50 - And I cheated.\\
51 - Gee, I, uh, I can't help but
notice that you're pouting.\\
52 - Oh, no, no.
I'm not pouting.\\
53 - That would upset our routine.\\
54 - God knows, I wouldn't want
to move in a new direction\\
55 - and accidentally slip in a
puddle of fun or anything.\\
56 - Okay. Here's a thought.\\
57 - How about you and I\\
58 - treat ourselves to a night out?\\
59 - Just the two of us.\\
60 - Well, that'd be great, Red.\\
61 - We'll go to Phillies.\\
62 - Phillies, huh?\\
63 - So, you'll have
the Salisbury steak,\\
64 - and I'll have
the baked chicken. Again.\\
65 - Well, maybe I won't have
the Salisbury steak.\\
66 - I enjoy their ham.\\
67 - Oh, ham.\\
68 - Well, okay, then I can change
one answer on the quiz.\\
69 - So, okay,
we have four out of 10.\\
70 - We have moved up from
"predictable as the tides"\\
71 - to "humdrum."\\
72 - I'll just go change.\\
73 - Damn Cosmo.\\
74 - Ooh.\\
75 - Son, when we took you in
as an exchange student,\\
76 - you became our responsibility.\\
77 - And we're concerned about this
gang of ruffians you hang out with.\\
78 - They are my friends.\\
79 - That's exactly what
they want you to think.\\
80 - Now, we're not inflexible.\\
81 - I mean, we looked the other way
when you started wearing cologne.\\
82 - But now,\\
83 - you've brought the devil's
music into our home.\\
84 - Oh, no. That is not
the devil's music.\\
85 - It is Eric's.\\
86 - Rebecca, show the boy.\\
87 - Now, listen to what happens
when she plays it backwards.\\
88 - That cannot be good
for the record.\\
89 - There it is!
"Devil love me."\\
90 - "Devil lives!"
It's clear as day.\\
91 - What's funny?\\
92 - In my language,
the record just said,\\
93 - "I want to sex
your monkey."\\
94 - Which I have never done.\\
95 - So, Donna, I was thinking we
should go see a movie tonight.\\
96 - Oh, cool. I'd love to see
All the President's Men.\\
97 - Oh.\\
98 - Well, I actually hear
that isn't very good.\\
99 - Oh.\\
100 - Yeah.\\
101 - Hey, uh, I was thinkin'
maybe The Omen.\\
102 - Isn't that at the drive-in?\\
103 - Is that at the...\\
104 - Yeah, no, I guess it is.\\
105 - So, do you want to go?\\
106 - Tonight?\\
107 - Um, yeah, sure.\\
108 - When the
child was five years old,\\
109 - something terrible happened.\\
110 - The truth. Where does it end?\\
111 - The Omen?
That's at the drive-in.\\
112 - I know. I don't
know what to do.\\
113 - I really like Eric,\\
114 - and I'd like to have a
physical relationship, but...\\
115 - It's called, "make out," Donna.\\
116 - Say it.\\
117 - All right, make out.\\
118 - But I don't want
it to be public,\\
119 - I don't want it to be tacky,\\
120 - I don't want there
to be pressure,\\
121 - and now it's this tacky,
public pressure make-out thing.\\
122 - I understand.\\
123 - Everybody wants their
first make-out to be special,\\
124 - in some place romantic.\\
125 - Like Ireland.
Or Disney World.\\
126 - Disney World?\\
127 - Right, sorry.\\
128 - So, let's focus.\\
129 - He asked you to the drive-in.\\
130 - Did Donna say yes?\\
131 - And you said, "yes"?\\
132 - Yes.
Yes.\\
133 - Yes!
Oh, this is great.\\
134 - Me and Jackie will
come with you. No.\\
135 - Will you come with us? Why?\\
136 - Why not?\\
137 - Well, you'd be like competition.\\
138 - You'd be like a loophole.\\
139 - Loophole?
Competition?\\
140 - Yeah, I'd have to keep
up with you and Jackie,\\
141 - and that would make me nervous.\\
142 - I, I could always talk
to you if I get nervous.\\
143 - 'Cause you've got to be
bored with sex by now.\\
144 - What do you mean?
What do you mean?\\
145 - You and Jackie...
You and Kelso...\\
146 - Have done it
like a million times.\\
147 - True. We have never done it.\\
148 - Yeah. Slid into home
on the second date.\\
149 - He got to third base once
and that was an accident.\\
150 - Whatever.
Whatever.\\
151 - Don't worry, we'll be there.\\
152 - Fine.
We won't come.\\
153 - Perfect.
Thanks.\\
154 - Okay, now, see?
This dress says,\\
155 - "Look at me. Notice me.
Stare at me!"\\
156 - It's all wrong.\\
157 - No, you look terrific.\\
158 - Especially for dinner
at the Lion's Head.\\
159 - The Lion's Head? I thought
we were going to Phillies.\\
160 - Well, I, uh, changed my mind.\\
161 - Well, you never do that.\\
162 - The Lion's Head.\\
163 - It is so fancy.\\
164 - And it's different.\\
165 - I mean, hell, we haven't
been there in years.\\
166 - It'll be fun. Hmm?\\
167 - Oh, oh, this is so exciting!\\
168 - Oh, oh.\\
169 - Okay, now, if we are going
to go to someplace that fancy,\\
170 - I have to shave your neck.\\
171 - I'll get the clippers,
you hop in the tub.\\
172 - I am telling you, I heard it.\\
173 - The devil is singing
backwards on the record.\\
174 - It's not the devil, man.\\
175 - It's Congress.\\
176 - They passed a secret law\\
177 - to put backward messages
in our records, man.\\
178 - They want to kill rock and roll\\
179 - because they know
it makes us horny, man.\\
180 - Doesn't, uh,\\
181 - doesn't pretty much
everything make us horny?\\
182 - Cartoons make me horny.\\
183 - Oh, uh, and food.\\
184 - When you play
the record backwards,\\
185 - you can hear the devil speak.\\
186 - I am starting
to hear him everywhere. Ay.\\
187 - Satan is your master, Fez.\\
188 - Worship satan.\\
189 - Ay.\\
190 - Before you worship satan,
get him a cherry pop.\\
191 - Get satan a cherry pop.\\
192 - Get satan a cherry pop.\\
193 - A pop, man.
Get me a pop.\\
194 - Fez, man, get me a pop.\\
195 - Oh, I'm sorry.
I misunderstood.\\
196 - Satan's second choice
is root beer.\\
197 - Ay.\\
198 - Werner, party of two.\\
199 - Werner, party of two.\\
200 - Red?\\
201 - What is this place?\\
202 - Excuse me.\\
203 - What happened
to the Lion's Head?\\
204 - Burned down. Five
dead. Real sad.\\
205 - Welcome to Blanigan's.
May I take your name?\\
206 - I'll get back to you.\\
207 - Well, what do you think?\\
208 - Well, um,
it certainly is different.\\
209 - It might not be so bad.\\
210 - On your left, sparky.\\
211 - The staff is
certainly enthusiastic.\\
212 - Well, I'm sure I can
get us a nice, quiet table.\\
213 - Happy birthday\\
214 - Happy birthday\\
215 - Happy birthday\\
216 - To you\\
217 - I'll put our name on the list.\\
218 - Forman. Party of two.\\
219 - Okey-dokey.
That'll be about two hours.\\
220 - Here's 20 bucks.\\
221 - All right. We'll have
something in about 15 minutes.\\
222 - You don't want this place
to burn down twice, do you?\\
223 - All right. We have
something right now.\\
224 - That's what I thought.\\
225 - Well, sweetheart,
this is our lucky night.\\
226 - Oh, uh, would you check this?\\
227 - Sure.\\
228 - Looks real good.\\
229 - All right, let's go.\\
230 - Um, maybe I should, uh,\\
231 - go back to my house
and pop some popcorn,\\
232 - 'cause they always overcharge.\\
233 - Jackie and Kelso.\\
234 - What are you guys doing here?\\
235 - Nothing. What are
you guys doing here?\\
236 - Donna and I are going
to the drive-in. Remember?\\
237 - Thank you, Eric,
we'd love to go.\\
238 - Michael, get in the car.\\
239 - But, I don't think...\\
240 - Get in the car.\\
241 - Look, this isn't what
we talked about at all.\\
242 - I, I'm sorry, man.\\
243 - I'll take it slow.\\
244 - Try to keep up.\\
245 - Whoo-hoo!
Going to the drive-in.\\
246 - Hello. I'm Guy,
and I'll be your waiter.\\
247 - Would either of you
like to help yourself\\
248 - to our Blanigan-tastic
salad bar?\\
249 - What's a salad bar?\\
250 - Oh, it's right over there.\\
251 - All the salad fixin's. And you
make your own Blanigan-tastic salad.\\
252 - You mean my wife
has to make her own salad?\\
253 - It'll be worth the trip.\\
254 - - You're kidding, right?
- Red.\\
255 - No, no, no, Kitty, it's okay.\\
256 - Guy, my wife didn't get all
dressed up for a special night out\\
257 - so that she could make
her own salad.\\
258 - See, she could do that at home.\\
259 - For free.\\
260 - But she wouldn't have eight
Blanigan-tastic dressings\\
261 - to choose from
at home, would she?\\
262 - Are you being a wiseacre?\\
263 - Red, honey, honey. Your
neck vein. It's poking out.\\
264 - Sir, I can't bring her a salad.\\
265 - I'll get in trouble.\\
266 - What the hell kind
of a restaurant is this?\\
267 - You've got eight people
singing "Happy Birthday,"\\
268 - and nobody can bring
my wife a damn salad.\\
269 - Red, honey. Neck vein,
neck vein, neck vein.\\
270 - Come on, Kitty,
let's get out of here.\\
271 - Happy birthday\\
272 - Oh, screw your
freakin' birthday!\\
273 - God, this movie
even sounds gross.\\
274 - That's not the movie.\\
275 - And, so...\\
276 - You guys okay up here?\\
277 - No, um, I want popcorn.\\
278 - And I want Eric and
Kelso to go get it.\\
279 - Oh, Eric can go get it.\\
280 - No, Michael. Go.\\
281 - I didn't bring you here
to suck Kelso's face off.\\
282 - I know,\\
283 - I'm sorry.\\
284 - This is so awkward.\\
285 - You're right. And I wasn't
being a very good friend.\\
286 - No more making out.\\
287 - I promise.\\
288 - All right, uh,
about the popcorn,\\
289 - I need money.\\
290 - What? I don't want popcorn.
Get back in the car.\\
291 - She doesn't know what she wants.\\
292 - No. Michael,
Michael, no.\\
293 - We are gonna watch the
movie with Eric and Donna.\\
294 - But I missed the beginning.\\
295 - The little kid's the devil. They
have to kill him. Watch the movie.\\
296 - Look at me, Damien.\\
297 - It's all for you!\\
298 - Donna, it's, it's just,
it's just a movie.\\
299 - Do you wanna sit somewhere else?\\
300 - So bad.\\
301 - So.\\
302 - Here we are.
Back at Phillies.\\
303 - Yep. Good ol' Phillies.\\
304 - Good food at a fair price.\\
305 - You're ordering the
Salisbury steak, aren't you?\\
306 - Nope. I'm going
for the ham.\\
307 - Red, don't put your hat on
the counter, it's all greasy.\\
308 - Hey, pal, can I get
some half-and-half?\\
309 - Well, isn't this familiar?\\
310 - Okay, now, here's how we sneak
the devil music past Ozzie and Harriet.\\
311 - Observe.\\
312 - Alice Cooper, meet Pat Boone.\\
313 - Don't
resist me, Pat Boone.\\
314 - No, you're hurting me.\\
315 - Come on, take it.
No, it hurts.\\
316 - Come on.
No. Oh!\\
317 - But what if my
host parents hear it?\\
318 - Then satan commands us
to kill them, Fez.\\
319 - No.\\
320 - I'll tell you what.
We'll use the headphones.\\
321 - Yes.\\
322 - Kitty, I'm sorry about tonight.\\
323 - Oh, it's not your fault, Red.\\
324 - You know how emotional
I get when I read Cosmo.\\
325 - Boy, do I.\\
326 - You know, okay,
at least we gave it a try.\\
327 - I guess we have slowed
down, flattened out.\\
328 - Oh, at our age, it's inevitable.\\
329 - Okay, that's it!\\
330 - Red! Oh, my Lord!\\
331 - You're not flashing back
to Guadalcanal, are you?\\
332 - Hold on, Kitty.\\
333 - The night's not over.\\
334 - You know, the stars
are really just...\\
335 - Forget it.\\
336 - What?\\
337 - Nothing.\\
338 - So, uh,\\
339 - Jackie and Kelso certainly
made themselves comfortable.\\
340 - Yeah.\\
341 - It's a roomy car.\\
342 - Yeah, it is.\\
343 - You know, the bench
seat in the Vista Cruiser...\\
344 - Is the same as what's in
the full-size Pontiac Catalina.\\
345 - Wow, that's interesting.\\
346 - Smooth move, Forman!\\
347 - Okay, kids, break it up.\\
348 - Let's go.\\
349 - Whoa.\\
350 - Hey, you're adults.\\
351 - Damn right we're adults.\\
352 - I'm sorry, sir. My mistake.\\
353 - That's quite all right,
we all make mistakes.\\
354 - Now, why don't you go bust
some pot-smoking teenagers\\
355 - before I give you a good
adult-size kick in the ass.\\
356 - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\\
357 - Enjoy your evening.\\
358 - Oh, Red.\\
359 - That was so sweet.\\
360 - You let him off with a warning.\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - But you're not
gettin' off that easy.\\
363 - Oh, Red!\\
364 - Da, da, da
da, da, da, da\\
365 - Raindrops keep fallin'
on my head\\
366 - Ba, ba\\
367 - Just like a guy whose
feet are too big for his head\\
368 - In-a-gadda-ga-vida, honey\\
369 - This loud music
will not damage my hearing?\\
370 - No, no.
It's good for ya.\\
371 - Hey, Dad.\\
372 - Hey, son.
How was the movie?\\
373 - It was pretty gory.\\
374 - Yeah? How'd it end?\\
375 - I don't remember.\\
376 - Atta boy.\\
377 - So, how was your night?\\
378 - It was fantastic.\\
379 - Well, that's great.
Goodnight, Dad.\\
380 - Goodnight, son.
Oh, and, um,\\
381 - be quiet goin' upstairs.\\
382 - Your mother is very tired.\\
383 - So, Phillies was fun.\\
384 - Yes indeedy.\\
385 - Very dependable.\\
386 - As always.
\subsection {Episode 09: Thanksgiving}
1 - Laurie's bus isn't here yet.\\
2 - Dad, can we get in the car and
turn on the heat? I'm freezing.\\
3 - I'm not wasting gas just
so you can be comfortable.\\
4 - Well, can we at least
go wait inside?\\
5 - I'm not going in that bus
station with those people.\\
6 - God, I'm freezing.\\
7 - Oh, Eric, I forgot to tell you, your
sister's bringing a friend home,\\
8 - so you'll be
sleeping in the basement.\\
9 - The basement? They
should sleep in Laurie's room.\\
10 - Oh, and Red, I've been thinking.\\
11 - Maybe this Thanksgiving
we should skip the big turkey.\\
12 - Small ones are on
sale at Piggly Wiggly.\\
13 - This family doesn't
scrimp on holidays.\\
14 - Can you imagine my mother
sitting down to a chicken?\\
15 - Red, your mother
won't eat my cooking anyway,\\
16 - so that won't be a problem.\\
17 - Dad, they should
sleep in the basement.\\
18 - Red, last Thanksgiving she
said her jaw wasn't strong enough\\
19 - to chew the turkey.\\
20 - And that was
a magnificent turkey.\\
21 - Dad, it's my room.\\
22 - I work myself to the bone
for that...\\
23 - All right, that's it! Hold it.\\
24 - Now, Kitty, don't get
worked up over my mother.\\
25 - And you, you're
sleeping in the basement!\\
26 - And we're all having
a happy damn Thanksgiving!\\
27 - Mommy, Daddy. This is Kate.\\
28 - Hi.\\
29 - Hi, sweetheart. Oh, let's get in
the car, you must be freezing.\\
30 - So, you're Eric.\\
31 - Your sister didn't
tell me you were so cute.\\
32 - We are going to have
so much fun this weekend.\\
33 - You can sleep in my room!\\
34 - - Get Kate
settled into your room.
- Yeah.\\
35 - Oh, yeah, and hey, don't forget
to show her your GI Joe dolls.\\
36 - That's such a good idea.\\
37 - That'll give you a chance to tell
Dad about that professor you're dating.\\
38 - - What?
- Dad, he's joking.\\
39 - Gosh, I hope it doesn't get too
cold tonight. I sleep practically naked.\\
40 - So, Kitty, looking
forward to Thanksgiving?\\
41 - Yes.\\
42 - - Red's mother is coming.
- Mmm.\\
43 - What's that pet name
she has for you?\\
44 - Whore.\\
45 - Oh, you know, she doesn't bother
me as much as she does Red,\\
46 - and he's tense enough,
what with Christmas coming up,\\
47 - and him only working part-time.\\
48 - Part-time, huh? That's rough.\\
49 - Ooh! When Bob gets tense,
we take a bubble bath together.\\
50 - Soaking my naked body
really relaxes him.\\
51 - Oh!\\
52 - Oh, yeah.\\
53 - - Mom, Grandma's on the phone!
- Oh, I gotta go.\\
54 - Hanging out\\
55 - Down the street\\
56 - The same old thing\\
57 - We did last week\\
58 - Not a thing to do\\
59 - But talk to you\\
60 - Whoa, yeah\\
61 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
62 - So this Kate, is she hot?\\
63 - Of course she's hot.
All college girls are hot.\\
64 - I mean, we've all seen
the brochures, right?\\
65 - Okay, Donna. Help me
play some music. Right now.\\
66 - - So she's hot.
- Oh, so hot.\\
67 - Okay.\\
68 - Are you okay?\\
69 - - Um, yeah.
- Donna, how can you be okay?\\
70 - There's a college woman
sleeping in his bed.\\
71 - He's sleeping in the basement.\\
72 - Donna, stairs are not gonna
stop a high school horndog.\\
73 - Barbed wire will not stop
a high school horndog.\\
74 - A wall of fire
will not stop a high...\\
75 - Jackie, I get it, I get it.\\
76 - Poor Donna.\\
77 - So naive.\\
78 - So what do you guys wanna do?\\
79 - Eric,\\
80 - I hope it doesn't
get too cold tonight.\\
81 - I sleep practically naked.\\
82 - Naked.\\
83 - Naked.\\
84 - Yeah, well,\\
85 - I guess I'm just gonna...\\
86 - Just gonna...
I'm tuckered out,\\
87 - so I might as well go home.\\
88 - So, tell me about school.\\
89 - Oh. Well, I've decided to
major in philosophy.\\
90 - That's good, because they just opened up
that big philosophy factory in Green Bay.\\
91 - Eric, what did I tell
you about being funny?\\
92 - I'm not.\\
93 - That's right.
Now, sweep the garage.\\
94 - Yes, sir.\\
95 - I wonder if the Pilgrims
were clever enough\\
96 - to put peanut
butter on their celery.\\
97 - Kitty, could you get that?
I'm fixing the drawer.\\
98 - Oh, dear God.\\
99 - Your mother has already called
me five times this morning, Red.\\
100 - - You answer it.
- Kitty, I don't want
to talk to her.\\
101 - She gave birth to you.\\
102 - Hello.\\
103 - Hi, Ma.\\
104 - Really?\\
105 - It's for you.\\
106 - Hello, Mother Forman. Mmm-hmm.\\
107 - Just like I told you, I don't
know, half an hour ago,\\
108 - the kids will be there at noon
to pick you up.\\
109 - Yep, you're right. I need to
work on my attitude. Bye then.\\
110 - You know,\\
111 - I could have married Bill Bower.\\
112 - His mother was dead.\\
113 - What if he yells at me?\\
114 - He's not gonna yell at you.
You're doing him a favor.\\
115 - Go, go.\\
116 - Red, what a surprise
to run into you.\\
117 - I live here, Bob.\\
118 - Yep, yep, yep, yep.\\
119 - Okay, I'm going in.\\
120 - Actually, Red, I just
wanted to ask you a favor.\\
121 - My appliance store gets
real busy over the holidays,\\
122 - and I could use
a little help down there.\\
123 - Oh, you offering me a job?\\
124 - Now, I don't want you to get
the wrong idea. This is not charity.\\
125 - - Charity?
- No, not charity.\\
126 - I'm not looking
for work anyway, Bob.\\
127 - - But...
- Good night, Bob!\\
128 - Midge, he yelled at me!\\
129 - Come in.\\
130 - Wow.\\
131 - What?\\
132 - I was just coming up here
to get something to sleep in.\\
133 - So,\\
134 - I guess I'll see you later then.\\
135 - You can stay and talk
a minute, if you want.\\
136 - Okay.\\
137 - Close the door.\\
138 - Okay.\\
139 - So,\\
140 - Kate,\\
141 - that's short for Katherine,
right?\\
142 - Yeah.\\
143 - Have a seat.\\
144 - So, have you thought about
where you want to go to school yet?\\
145 - Oh.\\
146 - Well, I like your school.\\
147 - I found that it was really...\\
148 - Well, I have to go to bed now.\\
149 - Wait, we are in bed.\\
150 - Okay, I see.\\
151 - Okay.\\
152 - So, good night.\\
153 - Good night.\\
154 - Eric.\\
155 - Just one second?\\
156 - Okay, baseball,
Vietnam, Richard Nixon,\\
157 - Pat Nixon, Pat Boone, the
girl that does the weather... No!\\
158 - Okay, jelly fish,
really big spiders.\\
159 - Come on, dig deep, okay.\\
160 - The day we backed over Skipper
in the driveway,\\
161 - and instead of going to the county
fair, I had to bury him in the backyard.\\
162 - Okay.\\
163 - I'm good.\\
164 - And good night.\\
165 - Good morning, Red.
Happy Thanksgiving.\\
166 - Yeah.\\
167 - Well...
You're up awful early.\\
168 - Well, luckily I heard
the phone ring,\\
169 - when your mother called
at 5:00 this morning.\\
170 - Yeah, that is lucky.\\
171 - Mmm-hmm.\\
172 - Oh, before I forget,\\
173 - Laurie told me
what she wants for Christmas.\\
174 - A portable TV for her dorm room.\\
175 - I'm working part-time,
she wants a TV. Great.\\
176 - Maybe Bob can get you a
good deal on one from his store.\\
177 - I don't need any
help from that damn Bob.\\
178 - You know what he did yesterday?\\
179 - - He offered me a job.
- He did?\\
180 - Well, we have to move away
from such an evil man.\\
181 - Well, you're a lot of
fun in the morning.\\
182 - Hey, turkey boy.\\
183 - Wanna show me your giblets?\\
184 - So you made out
with a college girl?\\
185 - Kind of.\\
186 - - Start talking.
- Yeah.\\
187 - Tell it like a story,
like a sexy story.\\
188 - Okay.\\
189 - She, like, jammed her
entire tongue into my mouth.\\
190 - And you wouldn't think a girl had,
like, that much tongue, you know?\\
191 - That is great!\\
192 - Oh... Oh, yeah.\\
193 - What?\\
194 - I don't know,
I feel kind of guilty.\\
195 - Almost like... Dirty.\\
196 - Dirty is good.\\
197 - I like feeling dirty.\\
198 - No, no, I mean, I feel bad.\\
199 - Look,
I think I gotta tell Donna.\\
200 - Really?\\
201 - Well, on behalf
of men everywhere...\\
202 - Yeah, man, I mean
the right thing to do\\
203 - is juggle them both until
it all blows up in your face.\\
204 - Look, you guys don't
understand. I can't hide anything.\\
205 - The minute she looks at me
she's gonna know.\\
206 - Hey. What are you
guys talking about?\\
207 - I kissed a girl.\\
208 - - Shocking!
- I am appalled!\\
209 - You what?\\
210 - You know that friend my sister
brought home from college?\\
211 - - The slutty one.
- Yeah.\\
212 - I kissed her.\\
213 - Why are you telling me this?\\
214 - I feel guilty,\\
215 - because it was like,\\
216 - really kissing.\\
217 - So what we do
isn't really kissing?\\
218 - I thought you should know,
considering that you and I have a thing.\\
219 - Right?\\
220 - Well, obviously we
don't have a thing,\\
221 - if you're running around
kissing slutty girls, right?\\
222 - Okay, you're mad.\\
223 - Mad? No.\\
224 - Why should I be mad?\\
225 - I mean, in fact, you can kiss
whatever you want.\\
226 - Start with your own butt!\\
227 - Why are you here?
Why are you always here?\\
228 - It's Thanksgiving.
Don't you have families?\\
229 - Um...\\
230 - Hey, Donna, you wanna talk?\\
231 - I guess Donna
didn't take it very well.\\
232 - Take what well?\\
233 - Eric made out with Kate.\\
234 - - Anything else?
- Your son is a whore.\\
235 - Eric,\\
236 - Now, Donna just came through
here looking very upset.\\
237 - Would you have any idea
what that's about?\\
238 - I have no idea.
She seemed fine when we...\\
239 - - You already know, don't you?
- Of course I know.\\
240 - Donna is such a sweet kid.\\
241 - How could you do this to her?\\
242 - I don't know.\\
243 - You know, it seems like bad
things are always happening to me,\\
244 - like I have bad
luck or something.\\
245 - Son, you don't have bad luck.\\
246 - The reason that bad things happen
to you is because you're a dumbass.\\
247 - Now fix it.\\
248 - Look, Donna,\\
249 - can we talk?\\
250 - - I'll leave you two...
- No.\\
251 - You should stay. We don't have
secrets in our house.\\
252 - We don't sneak around on each other like
a little horny rat kissing other girls.\\
253 - Look, Donna,\\
254 - please come to my house
for Thanksgiving dessert.\\
255 - Everyone's gonna be there.
You always come.\\
256 - Please don't let some stupid
thing that I did wreck that.\\
257 - Well, I can't depend on you,\\
258 - so why should you be able
to depend on me?\\
259 - Look,\\
260 - Donna, please, okay?\\
261 - I'm really sorry.\\
262 - - And I feel really bad.
- Good!\\
263 - - Poor thing.
- Mom!\\
264 - Oh, you.
Of course I meant you.\\
265 - As a food editor, I wanted
to find out for myself\\
266 - just what makes
the modern turkey so good.\\
267 - Amen. Let's eat.\\
268 - Now, is everything on the table?
I still feel like I forgot something.\\
269 - Oh, my God,
I forgot your mother.\\
270 - No!\\
271 - Hello, Mother Forman.\\
272 - No, I didn't forget you.\\
273 - I don't know, the kids left a
half hour ago to pick you up.\\
274 - I can't imagine
what's keeping them.\\
275 - Put that back.\\
276 - Hi.\\
277 - The Toyota is blocking
the car, I need the keys.\\
278 - Could you hold on one teeny tiny
second? For the love of God, move!\\
279 - Are you sure they're not
there? Look out your window.\\
280 - Now do you have your glasses on?\\
281 - Where's your grandma?\\
282 - She's not coming.\\
283 - She said she's going to
Cousin Joel's for Thanksgiving.\\
284 - Oh. That's not so bad.\\
285 - Actually, she said it was a
shame she couldn't spend\\
286 - what might be her last
Thanksgiving with her family.\\
287 - But she does hope we
all enjoy ourselves.\\
288 - Well, you know what?
That's just fine.\\
289 - I don't need to kiss some
old lady's A-S-S on my holiday.\\
290 - You heard what I spelled.\\
291 - Forget it.\\
292 - Mmm.\\
293 - Ohhh.\\
294 - Ahhh.\\
295 - Ahhh.\\
296 - Whoo.\\
297 - So,\\
298 - you give an employees'
discount down there at your store?\\
299 - Twenty percent.\\
300 - Does that cover,
anything like, oh, say,\\
301 - portable TVs?\\
302 - Oh, heck, yeah.\\
303 - Congratulations, Bob,
you just hired me.\\
304 - Good.
I'm glad to hear it, Red.\\
305 - You know, you'll have to
call me Mr. Pinciotti at work.\\
306 - Oh, I got you good that time.\\
307 - Donna, I am so glad you came.\\
308 - I only came
because my mom made me, okay?\\
309 - Hey, Donna, all right, good
to see you. I got you some pie.\\
310 - I don't want any stupid pie.\\
311 - What? I didn't kiss her.\\
312 - Hey, there, Bob.
You wanna piece of pie?\\
313 - Oh, yeah.\\
314 - Hey, Donna.\\
315 - - Oh, don't get all
tough with me!
- Yeah?\\
316 - - Yeah!
- Okay.\\
317 - No. Look, we need to talk.\\
318 - I'll start. Get out!\\
319 - What do you want me to say?
I already apologized.\\
320 - You just want to forget about
us because I kissed some girl?\\
321 - Why'd you do it?\\
322 - Well, I have it on pretty good
authority that I'm a dumbass.\\
323 - So you liked it?\\
324 - Yeah, I liked it.\\
325 - "No" would have
been a better answer.\\
326 - Donna,\\
327 - look,\\
328 - that kiss was great,\\
329 - and if I could
take it back, I would.\\
330 - Because it's not worth ruining
what you and I have.\\
331 - Eric, you are a dumbass.\\
332 - So is that like,\\
333 - "I forgive you, dumbass,"\\
334 - or "Get out of my house,
you dumbass"?\\
335 - Mostly the first one.\\
336 - Wow.\\
337 - - Tongue.
- Oh, yeah.\\
338 - Okay, well, let's go to dessert.\\
339 - Just one second?\\
340 - Donna?\\
341 - Just one minute.\\
342 - Silk sheets.\\
343 - Joe Namath's butt.\\
344 - Strawberries.\\
345 - Slow dancing.\\
346 - The washing machine
with an unbalanced load.\\
347 - Well, I'm good.\\
348 - You haven't told anybody else
about last night, have you?\\
349 - I mean,
it's kind of embarrassing.\\
350 - I mean for me. Not you.\\
351 - No, Kate,
that's our little secret.\\
352 - So, Kate, you and Eric, huh?\\
353 - Like The Graduate,
older woman, younger man.\\
354 - You know, if breaking up
couples is your thing,\\
355 - you can do your
thing with me, 'cause...\\
356 - Michael!\\
357 - Hello, Kate.\\
358 - May I see your giant tongue?
\subsection {Episode 10: Sunday, Bloody Sunday}
1 - Damn!
Oh!\\
2 - Kelso misses another
one.\\
3 - I believe that's H-O-R.\\
4 - Ah! You are a whore.\\
5 - No, the game is Horse.\\
6 - Okay. You know what,
Michael? I'm gonna go home.\\
7 - I'm gonna do my homework.\\
8 - You do your homework
on a Saturday night?\\
9 - Yeah.
Okay.\\
10 - Look, I mean, look at me.\\
11 - I've got a 1,000-word
term paper due Monday...\\
12 - but you don't see me sweating.\\
13 - I've got a whole
crappy Sunday to do it.\\
14 - Jackie, don't go home.\\
15 - I mean, Steve Martin's
hosting Saturday Night.\\
16 - I hate that show, okay?\\
17 - They have commercials that you
think are real but they're not real.\\
18 - And then you
wanna buy the stuff.\\
19 - Okay. See you, Michael.\\
20 - Bye! Bye-bye!\\
21 - Shut up.\\
22 - Kelso, Jackie does her
homework on Saturday night.\\
23 - That's so hip.\\
24 - You guys don't have to
worry about Jackie anymore\\
25 - 'cause I'm breaking up with her.\\
26 - We are so tired of
hearing you say that.\\
27 - No. I am.
I'm breaking up with her.\\
28 - Yeah, when?\\
29 - I'm picking my moment.\\
30 - Hey, where's Fez?\\
31 - Make that shot, whore.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - Whoa, yeah\\
39 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
40 - Well, now, aren't the waffles extra
delicious this wonderful morning?\\
41 - Did you quit smoking again?\\
42 - And why do you ask, little one?\\
43 - You're kind of talking like
Snow White, so I figured...\\
44 - Eric!\\
45 - Which is great, um,
I really want you to quit.\\
46 - Well, I should've quit
a long time ago.\\
47 - I'm a nurse.
I know better.\\
48 - More sausage?\\
49 - I'll get it.\\
50 - Hello?\\
51 - That's too bad.\\
52 - Well, sure. Be glad to.\\
53 - Yeah. See you soon.\\
54 - Goodbye.\\
55 - Who was that, dear?\\
56 - Uh, my mother.\\
57 - Seems like...\\
58 - Uncle Paul broke
his ankle and, uh...\\
59 - she's going to church with
us today.\\
60 - No, she's not.\\
61 - It's Paul's turn to take her.\\
62 - Well, like I said,
he broke his ankle.\\
63 - Broken ankle, whatever.
It's his turn.\\
64 - Kitty, the man is injured.\\
65 - Okay. That is just great.\\
66 - I will just take a chicken
out of the freezer...\\
67 - ...because queen Bernice...\\
68 - doesn't like ham.\\
69 - Okay, look, I'll just call her
and tell her we can't make it.\\
70 - Oh, Red, Red, Red, Red, Red...\\
71 - You know who'll
get blamed for that.\\
72 - But why should she blame you?
She's my mother.\\
73 - Something she
never lets me forget.\\
74 - Look, uh, you could tell her
I'm sick or something.\\
75 - Eric, go upstairs...\\
76 - and put on that shirt
your grandmother gave you.\\
77 - Eric, just stay there. Your
mother is just being ridiculous.\\
78 - You know what's ridiculous, is
giving your mother our phone number.\\
79 - What's being ridiculous is...\\
80 - Hold it. Hold it.\\
81 - Hold it. Now, look...\\
82 - let's just stay calm.\\
83 - Mom, if it'll help you out,
I'll hang out with Grandma...\\
84 - so she'll leave you alone.\\
85 - What do you say?\\
86 - First of all, Eric, I'm the
one who says "hold it."\\
87 - When you pay the bills,
you get to say "hold it."\\
88 - Now get in the car, 'cause
we're going to church...\\
89 - and we're gonna have
a damn nice Sunday.\\
90 - Well, you're damn right.
Just try and stop me.\\
91 - Damn.\\
92 - Here she comes.\\
93 - Oh, God, Red, I don't
think I can do this.\\
94 - Kitty, do us all
a favor and light up.\\
95 - I'm fine.\\
96 - Careful, Grandma.\\
97 - It's just my dress.\\
98 - Well, It's nice to see you,
Bernice.\\
99 - I hate this car. You
know, I just hate this car.\\
100 - Your brother Jerry
has a beautiful car.\\
101 - A Lincoln.\\
102 - But then, he makes more money,
a lot more money than you do.\\
103 - All righty, then.\\
104 - So, Kitty, Eric tells me
that you quit smoking.\\
105 - Yes, I did quit.
And I just... I feel great.\\
106 - Well, good for you, dear.\\
107 - In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\\
108 - Please stand for a moment
of silent meditation.\\
109 - Dear God. Thank you
so much for helping me quit...\\
110 - such a filthy, disgusting...\\
111 - soothing, delicious habit.\\
112 - Oh, God, I can't do this.
No, no, I'm fine. Amen.\\
113 - Dear God...\\
114 - what's with all the Polacks?\\
115 - Dear God.\\
116 - I don't mean to bother you
on your day off\\
117 - but I promised to
help out with Grandma\\
118 - and I have a term
paper due tomorrow.\\
119 - If you could either get
her to leave early today...\\
120 - or burn down
the school tomorrow.\\
121 - I mean, either or, God's choice.\\
122 - It'd really help me out, man.
God. Lord. Uh, Amen.\\
123 - Dear Lord.\\
124 - Would it kill you to give the
Packers a winning season? Amen.\\
125 - Oh, and, uh, watch over my
loving family blah, blah, blah.\\
126 - Welcome to
Worship for Shut-ins.\\
127 - Change it.\\
128 - All right, change that.\\
129 - How did we change
channels before Fez?\\
130 - I don't think we did.\\
131 - Oh, you guys, I gotta
work on my term paper.\\
132 - Where's Grandma?\\
133 - Oh, she's in the bathroom, so I've
got, like, 20 minutes, half hour tops.\\
134 - What's the assignment?\\
135 - All right.\\
136 - "In 1,000 words describe
the three branches\\
137 - "of the United States
government and their functions."\\
138 - I'll never make it.\\
139 - Well, go up and tell them
you have homework to do.\\
140 - No, I wanna keep
peace in the family.\\
141 - Yeah, Donna, Forman wants
the Hallmark card family.\\
142 - The what?\\
143 - You know, Grandma comes over.\\
144 - To
my mother-in-law on this beautiful Sunday.\\
145 - Your smiling face,\\
146 - your kind embrace has
made my home a happy place.\\
147 - And I'm so happy you're the one...\\
148 - to whom I gave my loving son.\\
149 - And
I'm so happy you're both happy...\\
150 - 'cause otherwise
life would be crappy.\\
151 - I don't want that.\\
152 - Yeah, you do. I can see it
in those wide, hopeful eyes.\\
153 - But the reality is this...\\
154 - To my daughter-in-law,
you took my son.\\
155 - You wrecked my life.\\
156 - You stole my youth.\\
157 - You hate my wife.\\
158 - I do my best.\\
159 - Now, that's a joke.\\
160 - I'm going out.\\
161 - I need a smoke.\\
162 - Damn it, Eric! Quit hiding
from your grandmother.\\
163 - She's old, she could
die. Now, move it!\\
164 - I thought she
was in the bathroom.\\
165 - False alarm.
Ah...\\
166 - Look, go take care of your
grandmother. We can do this.\\
167 - Thanks.\\
168 - All right,
how many words does he have?\\
169 - His name, the date, the class.\\
170 - Seven.\\
171 - - He's screwed.
- Yeah.\\
172 - Use his middle name.\\
173 - See? Now, this would
never happen to me.\\
174 - That is why I do
my homework on Saturday.\\
175 - This is a moment, Kelso.
Pick it.\\
176 - I think you all could learn
something from me right now.\\
177 - Moment number two.\\
178 - All right.
Jackie, we need to talk.\\
179 - You know what?\\
180 - I did the same paper last year
in history. I think I got an "A."\\
181 - You want me to go
home and get it?\\
182 - Let me think...\\
183 - Yeah!\\
184 - Hold on, Donna.\\
185 - Jackie, we need to talk about
this whole...\\
186 - Jackie, why don't you go ahead?\\
187 - Okay.\\
188 - Do not break up with her yet,
you understand me?\\
189 - Say you understand me.\\
190 - All this time I thought
you didn't like Jackie.\\
191 - Just don't break
up with her yet.\\
192 - Okay. Okay.\\
193 - All right.\\
194 - Hey, what do I need
Jackie for, man?\\
195 - I know more about
this stuff than she does.\\
196 - The three true
branches of the government\\
197 - are military,
corporate, and Hollywood.\\
198 - I need a pencil.
I got it. I got it.\\
199 - Jackie, run!\\
200 - Love!\\
201 - I hope you're hungry. Yup,
the chicken will be done soon.\\
202 - I can't eat chicken. You
know I have an irritable bowel.\\
203 - You should have made a ham.\\
204 - Oh, boy, Grandma...\\
205 - that was a great service
this morning. Don't you think?\\
206 - Well, I think the pastor talked
too much about forgiveness.\\
207 - Some people
shouldn't be forgiven.\\
208 - This is why theology is such
a rich...\\
209 - You know, Bernice, some
people don't need forgiveness...\\
210 - they just need
a little understanding.\\
211 - Oh, too true.
Have you seen Godspell?\\
212 - You know,
what I don't understand...\\
213 - is how in hell a brilliant
young man, like my Red...\\
214 - could have thrown
away everything.\\
215 - Grandma! Why don't we go into
the living room and I'll rub your feet.\\
216 - What a wonderful boy.
Oh, look at how thin you are.\\
217 - Is your
mother feeding you enough?\\
218 - You should come
and live with me.\\
219 - No.\\
220 - I was just on my
way to the garage.\\
221 - To, uh, fix this.\\
222 - Dad, just watch your game.\\
223 - No, no, it's just the Packers.\\
224 - Eric, where've you been hiding?\\
225 - Well, I've been doing
some homework.\\
226 - Oh, that's important.\\
227 - Yeah. You know, actually,
it's a really interesting...\\
228 - Eric, a little less talk
and a little more rubbing.\\
229 - Oh...\\
230 - You're the only one who's
not afraid of my bunion.\\
231 - Oh, dear.\\
232 - Okay.\\
233 - Oh...\\
234 - Goodbye,
Eric, I am going home now.\\
235 - No, wait,
Fez, you haven't met Grandma.\\
236 - Oh.\\
237 - Hello, Grandma.\\
238 - Oh...\\
239 - In my village, we worship feet.\\
240 - And these dogs
are a holy treasure.\\
241 - You wanna rub them?\\
242 - May I?\\
243 - Knock yourself out.\\
244 - Hey, Dad.
Damn it, Eric!\\
245 - Don't sneak up on a person
like that when they're doing this.\\
246 - How's it going in there?\\
247 - I rubbed her feet.\\
248 - Now, you're a brave one.\\
249 - Better get back in there.\\
250 - Hey, Dad,
you coming back inside?\\
251 - Eric...\\
252 - I love your
grandmother very, very much.\\
253 - I just can't talk to her
or spend any time with her.\\
254 - Did I mention that I'm
in there rubbing her feet?\\
255 - You know, son...\\
256 - sometimes you've just gotta
play through the pain.\\
257 - What?\\
258 - I don't know. Just get
back in there. Yeah, right.\\
259 - "With their sugar-coated ideals\\
260 - "designed to anesthetize
the ignorant masses.\\
261 - "Why? So that the military
slash corporate branches\\
262 - "can carry out
world domination."\\
263 - All right, read that back to me.\\
264 - Okay.\\
265 - You didn't get that?\\
266 - All right, let's just
use the encyclopedia.\\
267 - Oh, oh...\\
268 - You just want to vomit up
facts from an encyclopedia?\\
269 - Yes.
Okay, fine.\\
270 - You know what?
Vomit away.\\
271 - I will not be
a part of this, then.\\
272 - Eric, are you down here?\\
273 - He's not down here,
Mrs. Forman.\\
274 - Donna, good, why don't
you come up and eat with us?\\
275 - I need all the help I can get. Not
you, Steven. Grandma doesn't like you.\\
276 - Lucky bastard.\\
277 - Well, what am I supposed to eat?\\
278 - Oh, um, you know, help
yourself to the deep freeze.\\
279 - But everything's frozen.\\
280 - And I have a dryer.\\
281 - Honey, these, uh, cheesy
potatoes are delicious.\\
282 - Thank you, honey.\\
283 - They really are great,
Mrs. Forman.\\
284 - We have them
whenever Grandma comes over...\\
285 - 'cause Mom knows how much
she loves them. Right, Grandma?\\
286 - They make me sick.\\
287 - I'm allergic to dairy.\\
288 - Oh, how sad.\\
289 - Ma, this is Wisconsin.
You're not allergic to dairy.\\
290 - Well, maybe she's just allergic
to my dairy.\\
291 - If you're allergic to dairy you
shouldn't put cream in your coffee.\\
292 - I mean, cream is dairy.\\
293 - Donna, just, no...
No, okay?\\
294 - You shut up, Eric!
Who the hell are you?\\
295 - Grandma, that's Donna,
you've known her for 16 years.\\
296 - I have not. Anyway, I
like your new friend better.\\
297 - The feeling is mutual.\\
298 - Done.\\
299 - I heard a noise in, uh,
the garage.\\
300 - Raccoons.\\
301 - Bye.\\
302 - Well, um, I couldn't
eat another bite.\\
303 - I've had enough.\\
304 - I'm going back downstairs.
Excuse me.\\
305 - So, what say we watch
Lawrence Welk, huh, Grandma?\\
306 - No, I'm going to watch
Lawrence Welk with my new friend.\\
307 - You up for
another foot rub, Desi?\\
308 - Ooh! Fry time.\\
309 - Hot! Hot!\\
310 - What are you doing?
Huh?\\
311 - Um, just working on your report
here, and having some fries.\\
312 - Wait, you put French fries
in my mom's dryer?\\
313 - Yeah, the fish sticks
are too flaky, so I just...\\
314 - I don't even need to...\\
315 - Finally.
Where have you guys been?\\
316 - We had to look
for the paper...\\
317 - and eat...\\
318 - and then some
stuff happened, you know.\\
319 - Your shirt's on inside out.\\
320 - Yeah, that's the stuff.\\
321 - Where's the paper?\\
322 - Right. Okay, see?\\
323 - It wasn't on the three
branches of the government...\\
324 - it was on the four food groups.\\
325 - Okay, look,
my dad's got the World Books.\\
326 - I'll just run next
door and get "G."\\
327 - Ooh! I'll go with you.\\
328 - You can break up with her now.\\
329 - You know, I'm tired of everybody\\
330 - trying to tear me
and Jackie apart.\\
331 - Moron, every day you say
you're breaking up with her.\\
332 - Well, you guys don't
know her like I do.\\
333 - I mean, it's not just
about fooling around.\\
334 - She buys me stuff.\\
335 - She hoovered your chest, man.\\
336 - You know what?\\
337 - I don't care anymore.\\
338 - All I wanted was a little help with
my paper and you've done nothing!\\
339 - We put your middle name in.\\
340 - Jean-Claude?\\
341 - Yeah, that's two words.\\
342 - You guys suck.\\
343 - Just thank God for Donna.\\
344 - Okay, bad news, my mom
sold some out at the garage sale.\\
345 - But we have
"B," "X," and "R."\\
346 - All right.
All right.\\
347 - Now, you listen up. I have
had an extremely stressful day.\\
348 - And I am not proud
of what I'm about to say...\\
349 - but someone give me a cigarette!\\
350 - Now!\\
351 - But, Mom, we don't smoke.\\
352 - Cut the crap, Eric.
I am a nurse.\\
353 - I know that one in five teenagers
smoke. One, two, three, four, five.\\
354 - Now, I'm going to close my
eyes, and when I open them...\\
355 - there had better be a cigarette
between these two fingers.\\
356 - Come on, people.
Hop to!\\
357 - Thank you.\\
358 - Light?\\
359 - Kitty. Kitty.\\
360 - Kitty.\\
361 - Well, there you are, Red.\\
362 - Ma says the cat bit her, so
I'm down here looking for it.\\
363 - Dad, we don't have a cat.\\
364 - That's what I thought.\\
365 - Well...\\
366 - You know, we really...\\
367 - We shouldn't leave your
poor little foreign friend\\
368 - up there alone with Grandma.\\
369 - It's really kind
of nice down here.\\
370 - Oh, thank you for
a wonderful dinner.\\
371 - Well, you are so very welcome.\\
372 - Well, I hope
I wasn't any bother.\\
373 - Oh, Ma, you're no bother.
You're as welcome as...\\
374 - flowers in May.\\
375 - Bernice, here, I wrapped up
some chicken for you to take home.\\
376 - Oh, thank you, dear.\\
377 - And I hope you put some of
those cheesy potatoes in there.\\
378 - You know how much I love them.\\
379 - What?\\
380 - I thought you
made such a big deal\\
381 - about how you
were allergic to...\\
382 - Eric!\\
383 - It's been a perfectly nice
Sunday. Let's not spoil it.\\
384 - Sweetheart...\\
385 - I hope I didn't make too
big a deal about my allergy.\\
386 - Oh, no, Ma, he's a kid.\\
387 - He, uh...
He overreacts.\\
388 - You know, this is the
cutest little car.\\
389 - I just love it.\\
390 - Eight hundred and twenty-five,
eight hundred and twenty-six...\\
391 - Eric, what are you doing?
It's 1:00 in the morning.\\
392 - I'm just finishing
up some homework.\\
393 - What are you doing down here?\\
394 - Oh, well, um...\\
395 - Snow White came
down to gun a stick.\\
396 - Look, Mom,
I wish you wouldn't smoke.\\
397 - I know. I know. This is
my last one. I promise.\\
398 - By the way, um...\\
399 - thanks for your help
with your grandma today.\\
400 - Can I ask you a question?
Mmm-hmm.\\
401 - What does she have
against you, Mom?\\
402 - Well...\\
403 - About 25 years ago,
your father was dating this...\\
404 - very attractive,
well-to-do woman\\
405 - that your grandma
liked, and, um...\\
406 - and he married me instead.\\
407 - And she never forgave me.\\
408 - That bitch.\\
409 - Now, who was the lady
with the cotton-candy dress?\\
410 - That's Norma Zimmer,
the champagne lady.\\
411 - She is very talented.\\
412 - And you see those two dancing?
That's Bobby and Sissy.\\
413 - I like his tight pants.
Uh, she's a slut.\\
414 - You know,
I have seen this show before.\\
415 - But the band leader's voice
was much more masculine.\\
416 - Ooh! Bubbles!
\subsection {Episode 11: Eric's Buddy}
1 - All right, this is basically
all you need to know\\
2 - about Bohr's theory
of atomic structure.\\
3 - Cool, man. Thanks,
I appreciate it.\\
4 - Listen, you don't mind me
being your chemistry lab partner?\\
5 - No. Why would I mind?\\
6 - Just 'cause I, you know,
I tend to blow things up.\\
7 - Whoa.\\
8 - Buddy, what are you doing?\\
9 - Unlocking my car.\\
10 - No way.\\
11 - This is your car?\\
12 - Oh, so you're the guy I hate.\\
13 - Yeah, that would be me.\\
14 - Can I just...\\
15 - Yeah, man.\\
16 - I'm so glad
you're my lab partner.\\
17 - I could take you for
a ride if you want.\\
18 - No way. Let's go!\\
19 - Hey, don't do that.\\
20 - I'm kidding.\\
21 - Here you go, Red.
Your very first paycheck.\\
22 - Thanks, Bob. You know,
I really appreciate the job.\\
23 - Yeah, I just wish you had
a commission check in there.\\
24 - Well, I haven't sold
a damn thing.\\
25 - Yet. But if I paid people
for almost selling something,\\
26 - you'd be rich.\\
27 - But I don't.
So you're not.\\
28 - But, hey, today is your day.\\
29 - Oh, hi. May I help you?\\
30 - Yes. I'd like to
buy a refrigerator.\\
31 - Well, what kind of
refrigerator would you like?\\
32 - Well, I don't know.\\
33 - Okay. What kind of features
are you looking for?\\
34 - Um...\\
35 - I'd like it to be cold.\\
36 - Yeah. Uh, well.\\
37 - How many cubic feet of food does
your family consume in a week?\\
38 - Gee, I don't know.\\
39 - I do know I like Harvest Gold.\\
40 - See, now there's
your first mistake.\\
41 - Now, color is the last thing
that you want to consider.\\
42 - You see, I can't
sell you something\\
43 - if you don't know
what you really want.\\
44 - Yes.\\
45 - It was wrong of me to walk
in here, ready to write a check.\\
46 - But thanks.\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - Whoa, yeah\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - Hey!\\
56 - Hey! Hey, hey, hey!\\
57 - Brr!\\
58 - Where the hell is Forman, man?
This isn't like him.\\
59 - I'm really
starting to get worried.\\
60 - What if something
happened to him?\\
61 - Nothing happened to him.\\
62 - What if he's lost
or hurt somewhere?\\
63 - Calm down, Lassie, I'm
sure Timmy's just fine.\\
64 - Maybe we should
check the school morgue.\\
65 - Kelso, the school
doesn't have a morgue.\\
66 - Then what do we pay
all those taxes for?\\
67 - You know what kills me? You
do better in school than I do.\\
68 - I'm worried, man.\\
69 - Okay, fine. Let's
just be logical, right?\\
70 - Forman's not gonna
just ditch us.\\
71 - The Cruiser's battery is
probably dead or something.\\
72 - You know what? It's
starting to get late.\\
73 - Maybe we should
just start walking?\\
74 - No. I'm not walking.\\
75 - If God wanted us to walk, he
wouldn't have given us Forman.\\
76 - Oh, my God.
That's Buddy Morgan.\\
77 - Oh, man, I had such a crush
on him in seventh grade.\\
78 - He is driving the fiery
chariot of the sun god.\\
79 - He's with Eric?\\
80 - This is a serious clique breach.\\
81 - A serious clique breach?
That's the worst kind.\\
82 - You see, Buddy is in
the rich kid clique.\\
83 - They mingle with
the jock clique.\\
84 - Then you have your smokers
and your heads. Okay?\\
85 - Rich kids can be smokers,
and jocks can be heads,\\
86 - but jocks cannot be smokers,
unless they're rich.\\
87 - What about Larry Mosely?
He's a rich jock smoker head.\\
88 - Okay, now you're
just being difficult.\\
89 - Hey, guys. Buddy, you
know everyone. Right?\\
90 - Hi. No, I don't think
we've actually met.\\
91 - - No, I am Fez.
- Hi.\\
92 - My gosh, Buddy,
with a car like that,\\
93 - you must be knee deep in whores.\\
94 - Okay, let's head
back to my house.\\
95 - Now, Red, you know,
working as a salesman\\
96 - is different from
working at a plant.\\
97 - You need time to adjust.\\
98 - You need to use
your people skills.\\
99 - Kitty, I don't have
any people skills.\\
100 - Okay, come on, now.\\
101 - Come on. Buck up.\\
102 - You can do this. All
you have to do is smile.\\
103 - That is the most important
people skill of all.\\
104 - So come on.
Let me see it. Come on.\\
105 - Okay, you just keep on smiling.\\
106 - They're finally
getting off the island.\\
107 - No, Fez, they're not
getting off the island.\\
108 - But they have a coconut radio.
What could go wrong?\\
109 - Oh, Jilligan.\\
110 - Oh. There you guys are.
Where have you been?\\
111 - Where have we...
Where have you been?\\
112 - We've been worried
sick about you.\\
113 - We had to walk all the way
here, man. My feet are killing me.\\
114 - Are your fingers broken?
You can't use a phone?\\
115 - Do you know it's
freezing outside?\\
116 - And I'm wearing my uncle's
boots, so now I have a blister.\\
117 - Shaggy, Scooby,
we've got company.\\
118 - Huh. Buddy Morgan.\\
119 - Yeah, I know you.\\
120 - Yeah, I guess it's my fault.
I gave Eric a ride home.\\
121 - - So, uh...
- Get out of my chair!\\
122 - Okay.\\
123 - I really have to be
going anyway, so...\\
124 - Oh, hey, your car is
still at school, huh?\\
125 - Yeah, you're damn right it is.\\
126 - I could drop you
off if you want.\\
127 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
128 - And hey, guys, I'm real
sorry I forgot about you.\\
129 - - Did you want to drive?
- Hell, yeah!\\
130 - I call backseat.\\
131 - Did you see that?
He just ditched us again.\\
132 - Do you even know how
difficult it is to clique jump?\\
133 - Eric has achieved
something very special,\\
134 - and you're both
ruining it for him.\\
135 - Who cares?\\
136 - I'm tired and I never want
to walk anywhere again.\\
137 - Michael, walk me home.\\
138 - Okay.\\
139 - Okay, what's your problem with
Buddy? I mean, he seems nice enough.\\
140 - Screw him, man.\\
141 - I mean, he's got the money,
the car, the family.\\
142 - The teachers like him,
the counselors like him.\\
143 - Everybody likes him.
I hate him.\\
144 - Hyde, don't you think you're
overreacting just a little bit?\\
145 - Donna, let me tell
you something, okay?\\
146 - When high school's over, Buddy
Morgan's going to a great college.\\
147 - You know where I'm gonna be?
Sitting right here in my uncle's boots.\\
148 - Well, at least you've
got great friends.\\
149 - And I'll always be your friend.\\
150 - Thanks, Donna.\\
151 - That was sympathy, Hyde.\\
152 - Not an opening for you
to put your hand on my knee.\\
153 - Sorry.\\
154 - Move your hand.\\
155 - Now, ma'am, I'm a friendly guy\\
156 - and I want to help you.\\
157 - But if you don't know
how many amps you need,\\
158 - there's nothing I can
do for you. Think, lady.\\
159 - Wait. Bob!\\
160 - Hi, there, I'm Bargain Bob.\\
161 - Ooh! I see you're
looking at blenders.\\
162 - Now this one here,
all wrong for you.\\
163 - I'd say it's between these two,\\
164 - but this one, visualize
yourself blending with this one.\\
165 - Huh?\\
166 - Oh, yeah.\\
167 - Okay! Just take that over to the
cashier and have a beautiful day.\\
168 - Number 10, your order is ready.\\
169 - Yeah, I'll be right there.\\
170 - Number 10.
I have limited counter space.\\
171 - Please remove your hot dog.\\
172 - All right.\\
173 - I don't see why you can't just
serve us our food, Frank.\\
174 - We are paying
customers, you know.\\
175 - Hey, I did not lose
a leg in Vietnam\\
176 - so that I could serve
hot dogs to teenagers.\\
177 - You have both your legs, Frank.\\
178 - Like I said, I did not
lose a leg in Vietnam.\\
179 - Hey, guys.\\
180 - Hey, man, where's Forman?\\
181 - Uh, I don't know.
He's not with me.\\
182 - He's with that damn Buddy again.\\
183 - You know, he only hangs out with
Buddy 'cause he's got a Trans Am.\\
184 - So? You guys only
hang out with Eric\\
185 - 'cause of the Vista Cruiser
and the basement.\\
186 - We've been friends with
Forman since he was a kid, man.\\
187 - Way before he had
any of that stuff.\\
188 - That's right.\\
189 - Remember when he used to have
that tree house and the go-kart?\\
190 - Hey, you.\\
191 - Buy something or get out.
I've got a big wedding coming in.\\
192 - Frank, you don't have
a big wedding coming in.\\
193 - Oh, did I say wedding?\\
194 - Because I meant to say,
"buy something or get out."\\
195 - Fine. I'll go some
place else, then.\\
196 - Come on, let's go.\\
197 - I'm not going anywhere.
I just bought a hot dog.\\
198 - I'm outta here.\\
199 - Hello, welcome to the Hub.
May I help you?\\
200 - That was a great movie, huh?\\
201 - Yeah. I mean,
who would have thought\\
202 - working at a car wash
could be so much fun?\\
203 - So what do you wanna do now?\\
204 - I don't know.\\
205 - Oh, ahh!\\
206 - What?\\
207 - Nothing. I forgot
to call Donna.\\
208 - Oh, Donna.\\
209 - So she's like your girlfriend?\\
210 - I don't know. It's...\\
211 - I don't know.\\
212 - You know, it's okay
to be confused, Eric.\\
213 - Yeah, you know,
sometimes I feel like...\\
214 - I don't know, like
we're in a movie, right?\\
215 - And I'm nervous around her,\\
216 - and I feel like I'm
playing this part, right?\\
217 - - But it's not me.
- Mmm-hmm.\\
218 - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\\
219 - What?\\
220 - You're gay!\\
221 - Me? No, I'm not gay.\\
222 - You're not?\\
223 - But you just kissed me.\\
224 - Okay, I'm gay.\\
225 - Can you take me home now?\\
226 - And just because
Johnny's a boy,\\
227 - don't think that appearance and
physique aren't important to him, too.\\
228 - Johnny and Janey
both need reassurance\\
229 - that they are accepted and
respected for what they are.\\
230 - Look, I'm not gay.\\
231 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
232 - - Are you sure?
- Yes!\\
233 - 'Cause I just thought that...\\
234 - Why would you think that?\\
235 - 'Cause we've been spending
so much time together.\\
236 - Because we're friends.\\
237 - I've been
friends with Hyde for years,\\
238 - and I've never put
the moves on him.\\
239 - - Who could blame you? That guy's a jerk.
- Yeah, well...\\
240 - Yeah, but that's not the
reason. It's because I'm not gay.\\
241 - Right.\\
242 - I'm sorry for kissing you.\\
243 - That's okay.
I mean, it's...\\
244 - Let's just forget about it.\\
245 - - Do you wanna
listen to the radio?
- Hey!\\
246 - Look, I told you I wasn't gay.\\
247 - I'm dead weight.
I'm quitting, Kitty.\\
248 - Now, you can't quit.\\
249 - Why not?\\
250 - Because if things keep going
like this, Bob's going to fire you.\\
251 - It's a joke, Red.\\
252 - Oh, I know!
Let's do some role-playing.\\
253 - What?\\
254 - Some role-playing.\\
255 - I'll be the interested customer\\
256 - and you be the helpful salesman.\\
257 - Does this end up in the bedroom?\\
258 - We'll see.\\
259 - Okay, here we go.\\
260 - My, that's a lovely blender.\\
261 - This is stupid.\\
262 - Red.\\
263 - Well.\\
264 - It's got stainless steel rotor
blades so it can crush ice,\\
265 - which is why I keep
it out here at the bar.\\
266 - And it has the highest
wattage that you can get\\
267 - without moving up to
the industrial model\\
268 - which would cost
you twice as much.\\
269 - Now, see, we have had
this blender all these years,\\
270 - and I never knew
that's why we bought it.\\
271 - You didn't know that?
How could you not know that?\\
272 - Red, everybody doesn't research\\
273 - every product
before they buy it.\\
274 - Well, then they're dumbasses.\\
275 - That's right. And that's why they
need you to tell them what to buy.\\
276 - Hmm.\\
277 - Well.\\
278 - I think you are just
tailor-made for this job.\\
279 - Heck, I go in to buy something,\\
280 - all I know is what color I want.\\
281 - You're one of them.\\
282 - Well, I think you should
be nice to me, Red.\\
283 - Because I think I might be
interested in purchasing a mattress.\\
284 - Kitty, we don't even sell...\\
285 - Oh!\\
286 - I miss Eric.\\
287 - Well, you still have me.\\
288 - It's not the same, Jackie.\\
289 - I can talk to Eric about things
that I can't talk about with you.\\
290 - Okay, like what?\\
291 - Well...\\
292 - For instance, the
annoying things that you do.\\
293 - Michael!\\
294 - See? I can't talk to you.\\
295 - Hey, Eric, how's it...\\
296 - So what's everyone looking at?\\
297 - What are we looking at, man?
We haven't seen you in days.\\
298 - Oh, what, Hyde? You had to walk
all the way home from school again?\\
299 - That's not the only reason
we're upset with you.\\
300 - That's my only reason.\\
301 - I thought you
had another reason.\\
302 - No, that's pretty much it.\\
303 - Where's Buddy?\\
304 - Oh, Buddy? Oh.\\
305 - Buddy got...\\
306 - Busy.\\
307 - Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he
has a lot to do. He is popular.\\
308 - Yes, and so obviously gay.\\
309 - Buddy is not gay!\\
310 - Please, Fez.
That's just stupid.\\
311 - If Buddy was gay, he
would have been all over me.\\
312 - He would've.\\
313 - See you guys later.\\
314 - So, Forman. Uh, now that
the scary kids are gone,\\
315 - is Buddy gay?\\
316 - I don't think it's
really my place to...\\
317 - He's gay.\\
318 - Okay, guys, hypothetical
situation, crazy scenario,\\
319 - wouldn't happen in
like a million years.\\
320 - Let's just...
Let's say, okay,\\
321 - that Buddy made a move on me.\\
322 - Eric, he's not gonna make a move
on you if he knows you're straight.\\
323 - I don't know. I mean,
Forman is pretty irresistible.\\
324 - I don't think he'll make
a move on me again.\\
325 - Again?\\
326 - Or for the first time.
You know...\\
327 - I gotta go.\\
328 - You know, Donna,\\
329 - if Forman ever decides to dabble\\
330 - in the love that dare not
speak its name,\\
331 - I'm here for you.\\
332 - Well, you got your
variable speed here.\\
333 - It's completely
stainless steel throughout\\
334 - so you know it'll last forever.\\
335 - Comes with everything you see.\\
336 - And so, the only decision you'd
have to make is what color do you want.\\
337 - - I'll take white.
- Can't go wrong there.\\
338 - Thank you so much.\\
339 - You know, you're the most
helpful salesman I've ever had.\\
340 - Oh.\\
341 - Thank you.\\
342 - Well, you go ahead and
look around. I'll write this up.\\
343 - I sold a Mix Master.\\
344 - Jeez, Red, that's great. What
did I tell you? Today is your day.\\
345 - Hello, Kitty,\\
346 - guess who sold a Mix Master?\\
347 - Hey, Buddy. Um...\\
348 - I'm gonna need
those chemistry notes back.\\
349 - Oh. Yeah.\\
350 - Listen, man, if you don't want
to be my lab partner anymore\\
351 - then I'll understand.\\
352 - No, no. Oh,
I didn't mean it like that.\\
353 - Um...\\
354 - Look, we're still friends.\\
355 - Really?\\
356 - Yeah.\\
357 - Actually, Buddy, um...\\
358 - I wanted to ask, why...\\
359 - Why, why\\
360 - me?\\
361 - I don't know, man.
You know, it's probably,\\
362 - it's probably the same reason
that Donna likes you, you know.\\
363 - You're smart and sensitive\\
364 - and nice-looking.\\
365 - Okay, first of all,
I'm not really that smart.\\
366 - Those notes I gave you, copied.\\
367 - Okay, and as for sensitive,
sometimes I can just be downright mean.\\
368 - You're so cute.\\
369 - Well, that is...\\
370 - Well, I guess I am.
\subsection {Episode 12: The Best Christmas Ever}
1 - Man, the Grinch has a big butt.\\
2 - Yes. Nothing says Christmas
like a big, green Grinch ass.\\
3 - Hold the
ladder for me.\\
4 - So, Eric, what are you
doing Christmas Eve?\\
5 - Well, my parents are having
the same, lame Christmas party\\
6 - they have every year.
All the adults.\\
7 - "Hey,
neighbor, is that mistletoe?"\\
8 - All right,
how does that look?\\
9 - It's great, man.
Looks fabulous.\\
10 - Guys, the ornaments are up here.\\
11 - Oh, yeah.
Looks great.\\
12 - Oh, I just love Christmas.\\
13 - It's all about good
tidings and cheer.\\
14 - And shopping.\\
15 - Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's
what Jesus was going for.\\
16 - Hey, I give, too.\\
17 - Every year, my friends
and I deliver gift baskets\\
18 - to the unfortunate.\\
19 - I think you mean less fortunate.\\
20 - Okay, whatever. Bums.\\
21 - Oh, what are you guys
doing watching cartoons?\\
22 - Holiday Inn is on.\\
23 - Where the
treetops glisten\\
24 - La, la, la, listen\\
25 - Eric, come on, help
me get the decorations.\\
26 - Sure, Mom.\\
27 - You know what my favorite
Christmas gift of all time is?\\
28 - Lite Brite.\\
29 - It's fun making
things with Lite Brite.\\
30 - Well, It is.\\
31 - Man, my favorite gift is cash.\\
32 - That way you can buy whatever
you want. Know what I mean, Donna?\\
33 - Like, let's just say
somebody gave you, uh,\\
34 - $6 and some change, right?\\
35 - You know, to buy a
present. What would you get?\\
36 - Hyde, it doesn't matter
how much a gift costs\\
37 - as long as it's personal
and sentimental.\\
38 - You know what's both
personal and sentimental?\\
39 - Diamonds.\\
40 - We were going through a box\\
41 - of Christmas decorations...\\
42 - and we found the Christmas rat.\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - Whoa, yeah\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - So, um, Laurie, seeing
anyone special at college?\\
52 - Oh, I like to date around.\\
53 - Slut!\\
54 - Well, bless you.\\
55 - Thanks, Mom.\\
56 - Hey, uh, Dad, instead of
being at your party this year\\
57 - I was thinking of throwing
a party in the basement.\\
58 - I mean, I think I'm old enough.\\
59 - Fine.\\
60 - Fine?\\
61 - Every year he just
mopes around here\\
62 - like it's the end
of the world, anyway.\\
63 - All right! Thanks, Dad.\\
64 - So now who's going
to sing the high parts on\\
65 - The Little Drummer Boy?\\
66 - Traditionally it's the man
who can't grow facial hair.\\
67 - Dad, one more
thing about the party.\\
68 - Um, I need some money.\\
69 - All right, Eric.\\
70 - I want you to pick
out this year's tree.\\
71 - And, whatever you don't spend...\\
72 - you can use for your party.\\
73 - You know how much I hate
haggling with those tree...\\
74 - Haggling is part of being
an adult. Here's $40.\\
75 - I want $50.\\
76 - Knock it off!\\
77 - Pick out a good one.\\
78 - Okay, fine.
Throw your party.\\
79 - But can I at least make you
some punch and cookies?\\
80 - Mom, no.
Just punch?\\
81 - No, Mom.\\
82 - You can't have a Christmas
party without punch.\\
83 - That, that's just insanity!\\
84 - Merry Christmas.\\
85 - You know, Bob, I just
want to thank you again\\
86 - for the job, you know?\\
87 - Aw. I always need extra
help during the holidays.\\
88 - I feel like you're my
second-in-command around here.\\
89 - So listen...\\
90 - how about you close up for
me on Christmas Eve, huh?\\
91 - Why would we be open?\\
92 - It's a big night, Red.\\
93 - See, picture a guy driving home
from work on Christmas Eve.\\
94 - Fa, la, la, la, la\\
95 - Bob, nobody works
on Christmas Eve.\\
96 - All of a sudden, he realizes
he forgot to buy a gift!\\
97 - Then he passes
by the store here,\\
98 - sees we're the only place open.\\
99 - So what does he do?\\
100 - He comes in here
and buys a fridge.\\
101 - So this guy's insane?\\
102 - Not my place to judge.\\
103 - So what do you say?\\
104 - Fine.\\
105 - I knew I could
count on you, Red.\\
106 - Of course, you'll have to
wear the Santa Claus suit.\\
107 - Ah, you got me there, Bob.\\
108 - No, I'm serious, Red.\\
109 - No. You got me
there, Bob.\\
110 - Forman, man, would you relax?\\
111 - This is a good plan.\\
112 - We cut down the tree,
keep the $40 for beer.\\
113 - Car.\\
114 - Where?\\
115 - Kelso, "Car" means get down.\\
116 - Okay, I'm done.\\
117 - No, I disagree, Kelso.
See, if you were done,\\
118 - the tree would probably
be more horizontal.\\
119 - No, I mean I'm done.\\
120 - Car!\\
121 - All right, cut it yourself.\\
122 - Fine, Kelso.\\
123 - Do you believe him?\\
124 - Hyde, did you have to
write your name in the snow\\
125 - so close to the tree?\\
126 - Sorry.\\
127 - Now we
got $40 for beer.\\
128 - You know what else we
should do? Not get any presents.\\
129 - No presents.
That way...\\
130 - we got more money for beer.\\
131 - Shut up!\\
132 - Oh, Eric. This is
the most beautiful tree\\
133 - I think we have ever had.\\
134 - Oh, And it's just...
It's so fresh.\\
135 - Mrs. Pinciotti?\\
136 - Look, I was thinking
about getting a present for...\\
137 - this girl. And, um...\\
138 - you know, she's
about Donna's age\\
139 - so I was kinda wondering
what Donna likes.\\
140 - Perfume. Donna
wears White Shoulders.\\
141 - It's not just for shoulders,
you can wear it anywhere.\\
142 - Really?
Sure.\\
143 - Like your neck, or the mall.\\
144 - Wow!\\
145 - All right, well, How much
does a bottle of that run?\\
146 - Mmm, about $12.\\
147 - Oh.\\
148 - Well, what about a
bottle of crappy perfume?\\
149 - What does that run?\\
150 - Gosh, I don't know.
I'll call Bob's mom.\\
151 - Oh, you did not get this
from a lot. You stole it.\\
152 - I haggled.\\
153 - With who?
Smokey the Bear?\\
154 - You stole it.\\
155 - Well, I mean,
you're one to talk.\\
156 - You're flunking out of college.\\
157 - How'd you know?
I didn't.\\
158 - Shut up!\\
159 - Shut up.
You shut up!\\
160 - You shut up!\\
161 - Okay.
Okay.\\
162 - Okay, now be
careful with this one.\\
163 - It's very, very old.\\
164 - Oh, it looks terrible.\\
165 - Laurie, hang that one
around on the back side.\\
166 - Okay, Grandma.\\
167 - You know, Kitty, you've
got two red ones together.\\
168 - Uh-huh, so I do.
Thank you, Bernice.\\
169 - Eric, help me
hang these stupid ornaments.\\
170 - I can't. I'm
planning a party.\\
171 - I don't get it.\\
172 - How come the little drummer
boy gets to have a party?\\
173 - Because I asked,
you stupid sister.\\
174 - That's not clever.\\
175 - I don't have time to be clever.\\
176 - I'm planning a party, Miss...\\
177 - Dumb girl.\\
178 - I'll get it.\\
179 - Oh, hi, is Michael here?\\
180 - There's no Michael here.
You have the wrong address.\\
181 - Michael, I want you to drive
me and my friends around\\
182 - on Christmas Eve.\\
183 - Why?\\
184 - To distribute gift baskets
to the less fortunate bums.\\
185 - Okay, but we better be
back in time for the party.\\
186 - Yes. Perhaps you lovely
ladies would like to join us?\\
187 - I don't think so.\\
188 - Well, we are supposed to
be helping the less fortunate.\\
189 - Okay.\\
190 - Jackie, come here.\\
191 - Why?\\
192 - Just come here.\\
193 - Hyde, if you want
to make out with me,\\
194 - the answer's probably no.\\
195 - Yeah, okay.
Look, Jackie...\\
196 - I know this girl, right?\\
197 - And I want to get her
a Christmas present.\\
198 - Oh, my God, it's Donna!\\
199 - It's not Donna.\\
200 - Okay, it's not Donna.\\
201 - So how much do
you have to spend?\\
202 - $6.\\
203 - You don't deserve
a girl like Donna for $6.\\
204 - I'm not trying to get Donna.\\
205 - Good, 'cause you won't, for $6.\\
206 - You know what? Thanks
a lot, never mind, bye-bye.\\
207 - We will see you tomorrow, babes.\\
208 - May I ask you a question?\\
209 - Sure.\\
210 - What the hell are you doing?\\
211 - What?\\
212 - Buying Donna a gift.
You know Eric likes her.\\
213 - I know, man, but, you
know, they're not officially...\\
214 - Still, in my country, I would
string you from the tallest tree.\\
215 - We're not in your country, Fez.\\
216 - Right. So good
luck with Donna.\\
217 - Remember, every day is
Christmas at Bargain Bob's!\\
218 - We're back
from the store.\\
219 - Kitty, I made a few
changes on your grocery list.\\
220 - I don't like your taste in dip.\\
221 - No, oh, Laurie. No, that
punch is for Eric's party.\\
222 - Here, why don't you take
this tonic out to the bar?\\
223 - Make sure we have
enough rum and vodka.\\
224 - Oh, all that rum and vodka.
Kitty, you have a problem.\\
225 - It's for the party, Bernice.\\
226 - Oh, that's convenient.\\
227 - All I know is that\\
228 - my Red didn't start to
drink until he met you.\\
229 - And I didn't start to
drink until I met you.\\
230 - Merry Christmas.\\
231 - Okay, Bernice,
here, um...\\
232 - help me get more
of the party supplies.\\
233 - Merry Christmas.\\
234 - Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.\\
235 - This should probably go here.\\
236 - Mistletoe?\\
237 - Yeah, it's really
more for decoration.\\
238 - Is that a fact, neighbor?\\
239 - Um, No.\\
240 - Here, Eric,
where do we put the beer?\\
241 - Oh, uh, put it in
the ice chest.\\
242 - Okay, now, here you go. Punch
and cookies, just like I promised.\\
243 - No, Mom! Mom!\\
244 - Eric, Mom made it for you.\\
245 - The least you could do
is drink a lot of it.\\
246 - You know, you two...\\
247 - you are just the best Christmas
present a mother could have.\\
248 - Ooh.\\
249 - Hello, Laurie.\\
250 - Kelso.\\
251 - So...\\
252 - Um...\\
253 - Cool.\\
254 - Merry Christmas.\\
255 - Ooh, punch.\\
256 - Yeah. Can I
pour you some?\\
257 - No, thank you.\\
258 - But if you would like...\\
259 - you can bend over and
put my gifts under the tree.\\
260 - Whoa, gifts? No, no, I
thought we said no gifts.\\
261 - No, Kelso, you said no gifts.\\
262 - What's Christmas without gifts?\\
263 - Yeah, man.
Where's your heart?\\
264 - Nobody tells me
anything around here!\\
265 - Now I gotta go get something
for Jackie. She'll kill me!\\
266 - Hey, cheer up.
Have some punch.\\
267 - I don't want any punch.\\
268 - I gotta get a gift for Jackie.\\
269 - Who I'm breaking up with.\\
270 - Hi, Mr. Forman.\\
271 - Kelso, what are you doing
here? It's Christmas Eve.\\
272 - I know, I'm looking
for a Christmas gift.\\
273 - You know, you're the only place\\
274 - in this whole town that's open.\\
275 - Yeah, I know.\\
276 - What can I get for $17?\\
277 - Well, we've got some really
nice heavy-duty extension cords.\\
278 - No.\\
279 - How much is that refrigerator?\\
280 - Hello, ladies. So
glad you could make it.\\
281 - May I get you something to
drink? We have beer, you know.\\
282 - What else do you have?\\
283 - We have punch,
but we also have beer.\\
284 - Punch is fine.\\
285 - Punch it is. Okay.\\
286 - Would you like to chase down
that punch with a nice beer?\\
287 - Oh! I am kicking
your ass!\\
288 - Good game, Mr. Forman.\\
289 - Oh, you're leaving?
Come on.\\
290 - Come on, we'll play
another game.\\
291 - No, Jackie's waiting
for me. I really...\\
292 - One more game, come on.\\
293 - You know who you remind
me of? Freddy Prinze.\\
294 - No, Ricardo Mottleblonde.\\
295 - You said,
"Mottleblonde."\\
296 - No, I didn't.\\
297 - Okay, shut up.\\
298 - Okay, Fez...\\
299 - I want you to say
something, like, really slow.\\
300 - Hello, my darlings.\\
301 - And when I say hello,
you know what I mean.\\
302 - Hey! He was
my friend first.\\
303 - Man, what's going on
with the pep squad?\\
304 - Yeah, they seem
extra stupid tonight.\\
305 - Jackie, this is for you.\\
306 - Ooh! Michael,
what is it?\\
307 - It's hot rollers!\\
308 - And with steam!\\
309 - Mele kalikimaka
is the thing to say\\
310 - On a bright
Hawaiian Christmas day\\
311 - Hiya, Red.
How'd it go tonight?\\
312 - Well, I sold a set of
hot rollers, Bob.\\
313 - And a, uh... ...pong game.\\
314 - I'll get it.\\
315 - May I help you?\\
316 - Ma'am, do you own...\\
317 - the 1969 tan Oldsmobile
station wagon in the driveway?\\
318 - No, I don't.\\
319 - Do you know who does?\\
320 - Yes, I do.\\
321 - Could you get them, please?\\
322 - Sure. Red!\\
323 - Sir, we believe your
vehicle was involved\\
324 - in the unlawful removal
of state property.\\
325 - What?\\
326 - We're gonna have to
confiscate that tree.\\
327 - The tree?
No, I mean...\\
328 - No... it's all done.
I mean, look at it.\\
329 - No!\\
330 - Hey. I got you something.\\
331 - It's no big deal.
But, you know, Christmas.\\
332 - Suddenly Hyde's getting bashful?\\
333 - Oh, wow!\\
334 - This is great.\\
335 - Hey, what is it?\\
336 - It's a picture of me and Hyde.\\
337 - Yeah, it's me and
you in fifth grade.\\
338 - I've had it in my drawer
forever, so I just framed it.\\
339 - That is so sweet.\\
340 - Yeah, that is so sweet.\\
341 - Um... Hey!\\
342 - Look, why don't you
open my present? Oh.\\
343 - Oh, White Shoulders.\\
344 - I love this stuff.
Thank you.\\
345 - You're welcome.\\
346 - Oh...\\
347 - Oh, my God,\\
348 - you can see my training
bra through my shirt.\\
349 - Yeah, I remember
that training bra.\\
350 - Gee, I, uh...
I wish I'd...\\
351 - gotten you something like...\\
352 - Man. Dude, it's nothing.\\
353 - It's not nothing.\\
354 - This is so thoughtful.\\
355 - It's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever given me.\\
356 - Next to the perfume.\\
357 - Right. I wrapped
it myself.\\
358 - I know how you like things...\\
359 - wrapped, so...\\
360 - Eric...\\
361 - before you explain the beer...\\
362 - maybe you can
tell me why there are\\
363 - two state troopers
in the living room\\
364 - confiscating our Christmas tree?\\
365 - Oh, that...
Um...\\
366 - funny story, and a true
story. You're gonna laugh...\\
367 - Get to the point!\\
368 - We cut the tree off the
side of the interstate.\\
369 - Well, that's just great, Eric.\\
370 - Now the party's over,
you're grounded,\\
371 - and I want what's
left of my $40.\\
372 - Kelso, give it to him.\\
373 - Oh, no!\\
374 - Yeah, I sort of spent
it on Jackie's gift.\\
375 - Oh, Michael, my hot rollers!\\
376 - You got in trouble
for me, Michael?\\
377 - Oh, I love you...\\
378 - ...Michael!\\
379 - Oh, God bless us,
everyone!\\
380 - And Hyde loves Donna.\\
381 - Whoa!\\
382 - She's crazy, man!\\
383 - Eric, what
the hell is going on here?\\
384 - Have these girls been drinking?\\
385 - No. Look, Dad, I swear.
Just Mom's punch.\\
386 - Lousy with hooch!\\
387 - You see? You see, Red? She's
drunk, man. That's drunk talk.\\
388 - False.\\
389 - Come on, Jackie. I'll take
you and the "sob sisters" home.\\
390 - Eric, the rest of that beer
goes in my refrigerator.\\
391 - Donna, your father's
upstairs. I suggest you join him.\\
392 - Steven, you help Eric
clean up. And Kelso...\\
393 - go home!\\
394 - Eric, do something. Your
father's taking my women!\\
395 - Thanks for the gifts, guys.\\
396 - Merry Christmas.\\
397 - So what'd you get?\\
398 - ID Bracelet.\\
399 - Cool.\\
400 - Is your name on it?\\
401 - Yeah. What'd you get?\\
402 - Tube socks.
Good!\\
403 - I mean, tube socks are good.\\
404 - Thanks for working tonight.\\
405 - Sorry it was a slow night.\\
406 - No problem.\\
407 - Merry Christmas, Red.\\
408 - Merry Christmas, Bob.\\
409 - Now give me a hug.\\
410 - No, Bob.
Really, I'm fine.\\
411 - Hey, it's the '70s.
Men can hug.\\
412 - No, Bob, they can't.\\
413 - Come on, it's Christmas.\\
414 - Hey, look, mistletoe.
\subsection {Episode 13: Ski Trip}
1 - All right guys,
this is no sweat.\\
2 - If we leave right after school\\
3 - we should make it to
Jackie's ski cabin\\
4 - by, like, 6:00.\\
5 - Man, I can't wait. A
trip to my favorite place.\\
6 - Anywhere but here.\\
7 - And I'm betting that Alpine
Valley is gonna give the kid\\
8 - many make-out opportunities
with Donna this weekend.\\
9 - The kid is in.\\
10 - What's with
the whole "kid" thing?\\
11 - It's cool.\\
12 - It's not cool?\\
13 - Not cool. Dorky.\\
14 - Guess who made out with
Pam Macy behind the gym?\\
15 - Everyone.\\
16 - No!\\
17 - Me!\\
18 - Kelso, a lot of people
hang out behind the gym.\\
19 - Yeah, that's what's so great
about it. Everybody saw it!\\
20 - Oh! That's great, man.\\
21 - Yeah. Because now everybody
can tell Jackie, you moron.\\
22 - Yeah and then she's
gonna dump you\\
23 - and we won't be able
to go up to her ski cabin.\\
24 - She's never gonna find out.\\
25 - You are a dog,
Michael, a dirty, dirty dog!\\
26 - What did I do?
You kissed Pam Macy.\\
27 - I trusted you, Michael,\\
28 - and now all my friends
are laughing at me.\\
29 - I can't even show my face in the\\
30 - third floor bathroom anymore.\\
31 - And that's the cool bathroom.\\
32 - But, I...\\
33 - No, Michael.
We're through.\\
34 - Okay. If that's the way
you want it, we're through.\\
35 - And Monday, when we get back\\
36 - from that ski trip, it's over.\\
37 - No, Michael.
No, no, no, no, no.\\
38 - You won't be
skiing this weekend.\\
39 - Oh, that's just great, Jackie.\\
40 - Cancel the ski trip and
disappoint all our friends.\\
41 - Oh, no, no, no.
We are still going.\\
42 - Well, they're surely
not going without me.\\
43 - Right, guys?\\
44 - Oh, and did I mention
my parents are not coming\\
45 - so it'll be just us?\\
46 - So, we'll see you Monday!\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - Whoa, yeah\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - Uh-huh. So, Eric's going
away for the weekend.\\
56 - Uh-huh. Whole
house to ourselves.\\
57 - You know what that means?\\
58 - Dinner in front of the TV.\\
59 - No.\\
60 - You dog.\\
61 - Now, Eric, you're
gonna be driving in snow,\\
62 - so I'll put together an
emergency roadside kit for you.\\
63 - In case you run into trouble.\\
64 - Okay, that'd be great.\\
65 - Preparation makes all the
difference, Eric. Take kitty litter.\\
66 - I can't tell you how many times\\
67 - kitty litter got me
out of a tight spot.\\
68 - I remember one time in the '70s.\\
69 - Oh, my God, Eric.\\
70 - Oh. It's a road flare.\\
71 - A road flare
can save your life.\\
72 - I said, "A road flare
can save your life."\\
73 - What? Check. Great. Road
flare. Right.\\
74 - Okay, now, good.
How was school today?\\
75 - Oh, okay, you know my
PE Teacher, Coach Wilson?\\
76 - Well, he had this crusty
stuff in the corner of his lip.\\
77 - So Kelso says to him...
Kelso, says,\\
78 - "Hey, coach, check out
that crusty stuff..."\\
79 - Last week, the coach...\\
80 - Dad?\\
81 - Dad, are you even listening?\\
82 - Of course I'm listening.\\
83 - And you know what I'm hearing?\\
84 - You need to buckle down.\\
85 - I've told you over and over
again that school is so important.\\
86 - What you do
now determines...\\
87 - Oh, Red, that is so good.\\
88 - Oh, ooh, ooh,\\
89 - right there.
Ooh!\\
90 - That hasn't been
touched in years.\\
91 - Hey, Donna, man, I brought my
double sleeping bag. You know?\\
92 - Great. Can Eric
and I borrow it?\\
93 - Oh, Hyde, watching
you fail over and over...\\
94 - It is like Charlie
Brown and the football.\\
95 - Yeah, man, I just...
I just don't get it.\\
96 - No, because Eric already has it.\\
97 - Hey.\\
98 - Oh.\\
99 - Hey, Kelso.\\
100 - Um...\\
101 - Look, I just wanna
make sure we're cool.\\
102 - 'Cause this weekend is, like,\\
103 - really important
for me and Donna.\\
104 - So, uh, thanks
for understanding.\\
105 - Yeah. I understand.\\
106 - I understand that
we're not friends anymore.\\
107 - Okay, look, man, you
brought this on yourself.\\
108 - I know I did, but that's
no reason for me to suffer.\\
109 - No, that is a great
reason for you to suffer.\\
110 - What... I'm going.\\
111 - Fine. Go.
See if I care.\\
112 - Oh, come on, man.
Wait...\\
113 - Well, here's your emergency
roadside kit.\\
114 - Kitty litter?\\
115 - Oh, Kitty litter.
Right.\\
116 - Um, honey, I put some
sandwiches in your duffel bag.\\
117 - Now, um, why do you need
such a big bag of oregano?\\
118 - Donna's Italian.\\
119 - Okay, stay warm.\\
120 - Okay,
I see what's going on.\\
121 - You're not really going skiing.\\
122 - This is all just a gag. You're
trying to get me all worked up\\
123 - so you can go, "Oh, just
kidding, buddy!"\\
124 - Yeah, you got me.\\
125 - That's a nice burn.\\
126 - It sure is.\\
127 - Bye-bye.\\
128 - Aw.
He's not going.\\
129 - He'll be back.\\
130 - Yup.\\
131 - Any second now.\\
132 - He's probably just
going around the block.\\
133 - I gotta hand it to him,
he got me there.\\
134 - That's a major burn.\\
135 - Yup.\\
136 - There he is.
I knew it!\\
137 - Oh, no, that's not him.\\
138 - I have never seen snow before.\\
139 - It is so beautiful.\\
140 - Do you know what the
best part of this whole trip is?\\
141 - That Michael is not here.\\
142 - He'd just be sitting
here telling me\\
143 - how cute I look in
my fur-trimmed coat.\\
144 - I know I look cute. I don't
need him here for that.\\
145 - Forman, man, what's all
this crap that Red gave you?\\
146 - I don't know. He's
obsessed with kitty litter.\\
147 - I think he might
be going insane.\\
148 - Far out.\\
149 - What the hell was that?\\
150 - I don't know.
I guess we hit some ice.\\
151 - Oh, great, we're stuck.\\
152 - Look, I made my first snowball.\\
153 - I love snow so much, my
fingers are numb with joy.\\
154 - That's frostbite, Fez.\\
155 - How rude.\\
156 - I hate your white man's winter.\\
157 - Get in the car, Fez.
Get in the car.\\
158 - Eric, do something.\\
159 - Yeah, man, stop goofing around.\\
160 - It's freezing.\\
161 - This is awful. We're
all going to die!\\
162 - And I love Michael.\\
163 - Shut up!\\
164 - Okay, think, Eric, think.\\
165 - Why kitty litter?\\
166 - Use the gum, Eric.\\
167 - Dad? What're
you doing here?\\
168 - I'm not here.
You're imagining me.\\
169 - Now who's insane,
Mr. Smartmouth?\\
170 - Yeah, I guess I am.\\
171 - Use the gum to stick
the candle in the can.\\
172 - The candle heats the can,\\
173 - which melts the snow
behind the tire.\\
174 - Then pour on the
kitty litter for traction.\\
175 - Now you think you
can handle that?\\
176 - Yes, sir.
Good.\\
177 - Because you don't
want me back out here.\\
178 - I may be a figment
of your imagination...\\
179 - I'm still freezing my ass off.\\
180 - Michael, what are
you doing down here?\\
181 - You know what?\\
182 - I think Eric actually went.\\
183 - What a jerk.\\
184 - Well, why don't you just go to
Jackie's cabin and talk to him?\\
185 - I can't, I don't have a car.\\
186 - And besides, Jackie hates me
forever 'cause I kissed Pam Macy.\\
187 - You know, when
Mr. Forman and I were dating,\\
188 - I saw him kissing a girl
in a movie theater once\\
189 - and I forgave him.\\
190 - You forgave him for
kissing another girl?\\
191 - Yes, sir.\\
192 - I mean it wasn't... It
wasn't so much kissing.\\
193 - As it was, uh...
Uh, groping,\\
194 - sloppy, pawing,
nibbling nightmare.\\
195 - But, but you forgave
him.\\
196 - Yeah. I forgave
the bastard.\\
197 - Cool!\\
198 - Okay. Candles, check.\\
199 - Chianti, check.\\
200 - Fancy nut mix, check.\\
201 - And how's my pretty lady?\\
202 - Oh, you are so full of crap.\\
203 - Well, hello there.\\
204 - Hey.\\
205 - Thanks for stopping.\\
206 - Are you going all
the way to Alpine Valley?\\
207 - Oh...\\
208 - I'm going wherever you're going.\\
209 - Wow. That's lucky.\\
210 - So tell me, did it hurt?\\
211 - What?\\
212 - When you fell down from heaven.\\
213 - No, I'm fine.\\
214 - All right,
we made it!\\
215 - Yeah, just in time. That
storm was getting nasty.\\
216 - I am so cold.\\
217 - The snow has stolen my manhood.\\
218 - Okay...\\
219 - There's only one bedroom.\\
220 - It was gonna be
for Michael and I,\\
221 - but since our love is...\\
222 - Dead...\\
223 - you two should take it.\\
224 - All right.\\
225 - Want to go check out our
room? - Definitely.\\
226 - Where are you guys going?\\
227 - I thought we were
gonna hang the, uh...\\
228 - I am freezing.\\
229 - The winter in my
country is 70 degrees.\\
230 - We must hold each
other for warmth.\\
231 - Stop touching me!\\
232 - But I am going to die!\\
233 - Okay, Fez...
Ooh! Amaretto.\\
234 - You know what, man?
This'll warm you right up.\\
235 - Take a sip of that.\\
236 - Yum, liquid candy.\\
237 - Kitty, you're talking
about something\\
238 - that happened over 20 years ago.\\
239 - And there you
were at the movies,\\
240 - in front of God and everybody\\
241 - slurping on horse face,\\
242 - Lyn Taylor like
she was a Popsicle.\\
243 - Kitty...
A big,\\
244 - easy, horse-faced popsicle.\\
245 - Horse face?\\
246 - She was a runner-up in
the Miss Wisconsin pageant.\\
247 - Which she lost because
she was such a horse face.\\
248 - Thanks for the burger.\\
249 - Oh, and the hat.\\
250 - I just like to see that smile.\\
251 - You seem kinda down
about your friend Eric.\\
252 - Yeah.\\
253 - It's just...
You know,\\
254 - he's always been there
for me. Mmm-hmm.\\
255 - Like when people
used to call me dumb...\\
256 - he'd say, "He's not
as dumb as you think."\\
257 - People don't like to
talk about it but, uh...\\
258 - guy-to-guy relationships\\
259 - are pretty special, you know?\\
260 - They can be the most
beautiful thing in the world.\\
261 - I don't know why I do
this stuff. It's just, like...\\
262 - I get these urges, you know,\\
263 - and I can't control them.\\
264 - Shoot, I wrote
that country song.\\
265 - I've been cheated\\
266 - Been mistreated\\
267 - When will I be loved\\
268 - Okay, that's probably
just Jackie crying.\\
269 - Yeah.\\
270 - All right, all right.
That's too much.\\
271 - Can you please go out
there and break that record?\\
272 - Yeah.\\
273 - Okay. What's going on?\\
274 - Spy vs.
Spy, man, they kill me.\\
275 - No, with her.\\
276 - She seems upset or something.\\
277 - Okay, look, where's Fez?\\
278 - Fez? Oh.
Well, he killed\\
279 - that entire bottle of amaretto\\
280 - and then he ran outside, saying
he had to make a snow angel.\\
281 - But he was in his underwear.\\
282 - Okay, look, you either need
to go get Fez or console Jackie.\\
283 - All right, I'll take Donna.\\
284 - Jackie.
Jackie. Yeah. Jackie.\\
285 - Okay.\\
286 - Oh. Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, okay.\\
287 - Yeah, okay, no, I can
see you're upset.\\
288 - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Now, listen, all right?\\
289 - If it's any consolation...\\
290 - Pam Macy would
give it up to anybody.\\
291 - Well, what do you know?
We're all alone.\\
292 - God, Hyde, you can be
such a jerk, you know that?\\
293 - Oh, come on,
I'm just goofing around.\\
294 - No, you're not.\\
295 - Look, I'm up here
with Eric. All right?\\
296 - Eric, get it?
Not you.\\
297 - I know, okay?
I know.\\
298 - Look, do you think
I like hitting\\
299 - on my best friend's girlfriend?\\
300 - I don't.\\
301 - But I look at you,
I mean, look at you.\\
302 - I can't help it.\\
303 - Well, you better.\\
304 - It's so clear to me now.\\
305 - I can't just go around using
people as my sexual playthings.\\
306 - You know what I mean, Gus?\\
307 - 'Cause people's feelings
are, are way more important\\
308 - than those sexual urges.\\
309 - You're good people, son.\\
310 - You, too, man.\\
311 - Well...\\
312 - This is where you get off.\\
313 - And one more thing.
Next time,\\
314 - take a bus. You're
too pretty to hitch.\\
315 - Aw, thanks, man.\\
316 - Bye, Gus.\\
317 - Hey, Fez!\\
318 - Fez! Hey, man.\\
319 - Kelso. You're here.\\
320 - Yeah. I got a ride
with the nicest guy.\\
321 - Listen, pfft,\\
322 - I had a lot of time to
think on the way up here.\\
323 - And, well, I'm sorry.\\
324 - Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.\\
325 - I should never have come
up here without you, man.\\
326 - I am a winter nymph.\\
327 - I love the snow.\\
328 - Hooray America!\\
329 - Michael!
Oh, Michael!\\
330 - You walked
all the way here in a\\
331 - driving snowstorm
just to be with me\\
332 - didn't you, Michael?\\
333 - And you would never ever do
that for Pam Macy, would you?\\
334 - No?\\
335 - Lover.
You know it.\\
336 - Can one of you
guys put his pants on?\\
337 - Kitty, this can't just be
about me and Lyn Taylor.\\
338 - What's really bothering you?\\
339 - Okay.\\
340 - I just want to know why not me?\\
341 - Why not you what?
I married you.\\
342 - Yeah, but when we were
dating, you just sat there.\\
343 - You... You held my
hand politely.\\
344 - Didn't you think
that I might enjoy\\
345 - a passionate manhandling\\
346 - in a public place?\\
347 - Well, I respected you.\\
348 - I'm an old-fashioned guy.\\
349 - I don't think that you should\\
350 - grope and maul the one you love.\\
351 - Until you get to Florida...\\
352 - at the Fontainebleau...\\
353 - with the door locked
and a carton of cigarettes.\\
354 - Oh, Red, our honeymoon.\\
355 - Mmm.\\
356 - Let's go upstairs.\\
357 - No. Let's go
to the movies.\\
358 - Well, uh...\\
359 - Here we are.\\
360 - Tsk. Yep.\\
361 - So, I still
can't believe that...\\
362 - Kelso cheated on
Jackie with Pam Macy.\\
363 - I mean, that is just
a seriously uncool move.\\
364 - Yeah.\\
365 - I mean, to risk
everything for...\\
366 - Eric, I would never
do that to you.\\
367 - You can trust me.\\
368 - Really?\\
369 - Absolutely.\\
370 - I would never kiss Pam
Macy behind the gym.\\
371 - Oh...\\
372 - You know, never
say never, Donna.\\
373 - Well, this night
turned out okay.\\
374 - Pretty romantic.\\
375 - Yeah, it's just how I
imagined it. Just you and me...\\
376 - I do not feel too good.\\
377 - Thank you.\\
378 - Okay, maybe it's not
just how I imagined.\\
379 - Cover your ears, this
part gets pretty gross.
\subsection {Episode 14: Stolen Car}
1 - Forman, man.
It's a...\\
2 - tiny, little scratch. And
Red's never gonna see it.\\
3 - No, Red sees everything. He
sees when I put cheap gas in the car.\\
4 - I got it.\\
5 - We'll put my "gas, grass, or
ass" bumper sticker over it.\\
6 - Listen, Forman, whatever
happens, we'll all take the rap.\\
7 - Yeah.\\
8 - How'd you scratch
the car, Eric? Have fun.\\
9 - See you, Forman.
Later.\\
10 - Well?\\
11 - Well, uh...\\
12 - Sir, I was, um, pulling
out of this parking space.\\
13 - Well, creeping is more
like it. I was creeping...\\
14 - You were screwing around,
backed into a hydrant.\\
15 - I see the paint marks.
No!\\
16 - And by "no," I mean "exactly."\\
17 - But it wasn't my fault, sir.\\
18 - Kelso was giving me a...\\
19 - A what?\\
20 - Kelso was giving
me a purple nurple.\\
21 - It's, um, when you grab
somebody's nipple through their shirt\\
22 - and twist it really hard...\\
23 - until it becomes purple.\\
24 - Give me the keys.\\
25 - Dad, I...\\
26 - Your driving privileges
are suspended\\
27 - until you learn
some responsibility.\\
28 - Dad, I'm very responsible.\\
29 - No, no you're not.\\
30 - Responsible people don't go
around getting their nipples twisted.\\
31 - See, when you say it
though, it just sounds weird.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - Whoa, yeah\\
39 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
40 - Love!\\
41 - Oh, my God.\\
42 - "Hair Do's and Don'ts of\\
43 - "Olympic Gold Medalists."\\
44 - Oh, my God,\\
45 - is that Dorothy Hamill?
She's a virgin.\\
46 - Speaking of, um...\\
47 - You know, those girls at school
who do it, like, all the time?\\
48 - Yeah.\\
49 - All right, is it just me,\\
50 - or do they seem more relaxed?\\
51 - Hi.\\
52 - Hey, what are
you guys doing?\\
53 - They are talking about sex.\\
54 - Come on, Fez, chicks
don't talk about sex, man.\\
55 - It's dirty.\\
56 - Yes, we do.\\
57 - Especially when it involves
Michael Kelso, my dreamboat.\\
58 - Oh, Great. Now we have to talk
about Jackie and Kelso's sex life.\\
59 - This is my worst nightmare.\\
60 - All right, you know
what?\\
61 - Before you guys got here,
Jackie and I were actually\\
62 - having a pretty good time.\\
63 - I know.
I was surprised, too.\\
64 - Hey, Donna, you
wanna go to my house?\\
65 - You know what? Okay.\\
66 - So what do you guys wanna do?\\
67 - We could walk to The Hub.\\
68 - Too far.\\
69 - We could walk to...
Too far.\\
70 - Man, this sucks.\\
71 - I just can't believe that
Red took away my car\\
72 - because of one
stupid little scratch.\\
73 - I know, man. Who would
think Red would overreact?\\
74 - I did.\\
75 - I have noticed Red
is a real hard-ass.\\
76 - One toe over the line, sweet
Jesus, you are clobbered.\\
77 - You know what
I'm saying?\\
78 - Hey, guys. Check
it out.\\
79 - Did you get a car?
Yeah.\\
80 - My cousin Sully
loaned me his wheels.\\
81 - - Yes.
- So where to?\\
82 - You just want to hang?\\
83 - Yeah.
Cool.\\
84 - Snookums?\\
85 - Yes, Pookie?\\
86 - Do you want turkey or tuna
sandwiches tonight for dinner?\\
87 - Tonight? Tonight's
meatloaf night.\\
88 - Right, but I have my class\\
89 - at the community college
in Kenosha tonight.\\
90 - I told you about it last week.\\
91 - You most certainly did not.\\
92 - Yes, I did, remember?\\
93 - You were watching Baretta.\\
94 - Oh, Midge, you can't tell me
anything while I'm watching Baretta.\\
95 - It's complicated.\\
96 - Bob, I've been
telling you for months\\
97 - how I've needed
to expand my mind.\\
98 - Is this about jewelry?
'Cause I'll buy you jewelry.\\
99 - No, sweetie.
It's about me\\
100 - becoming a whole person.\\
101 - Midgie, don't take this the
wrong way, but that's just stupid.\\
102 - Well, I don't think
it's your decision.\\
103 - Well, I'm the man of the house\\
104 - and I say you're not going
to community college.\\
105 - You can't tell me
what to do, you big ass!\\
106 - What are we looking at?\\
107 - That scratch.\\
108 - What scratch?\\
109 - The scratch that
Eric put in the car.\\
110 - I got most of it out
with rubbing compound...\\
111 - but you should
have seen it before.\\
112 - It was a doozy.\\
113 - Well, that must have
been quite an accident.\\
114 - Was he killed?\\
115 - See, that's where his
smart mouth comes from.\\
116 - Driver safety is
serious business, Kitty.\\
117 - Well, you're right, Red.\\
118 - We should teach him a lesson.\\
119 - So when he comes home,
I'll hold him down\\
120 - and you burn him
with a cigarette.\\
121 - Just so you know, Donna, when I
finally decide to do it with Michael...\\
122 - I have the whole
thing planned out.\\
123 - First...\\
124 - I'll be wearing
a very sexy Renoir.\\
125 - Don't you
mean peignoir?\\
126 - Yeah, okay, whatever.
Stop ruining this, Donna.\\
127 - Okay.\\
128 - And then there'll
be candles everywhere.\\
129 - And also, there'll
be a gigantic banner.\\
130 - And then Michael will come in.\\
131 - And the wind will be blowing...\\
132 - and then we will have the
most magical night of our lives.\\
133 - So, if you have it all
planned out... Mmm-hmm.\\
134 - ...why are you, uh...\\
135 - Why're you still waiting?\\
136 - I want it to be
really, really special.\\
137 - Well, I mean, how could it
not with a gigantic banner?\\
138 - Exactly.\\
139 - Bob doesn't want me to take
this class, but it sounds so exciting.\\
140 - It's all about
female empowerment.\\
141 - It's called, "The Woman Warrior.\\
142 - "Fighting Female
Stereotypes."\\
143 - That's the professor.
Isn't he cute?\\
144 - Uh-huh. Darling.\\
145 - So you want to come?\\
146 - Oh, well, um, I can't
say I'm not tempted.\\
147 - Yes, I can.
I'm not tempted.\\
148 - Don't you want to become
an empowered woman?\\
149 - Well, you know, I just... I don't have
time to be an empowered woman.\\
150 - I'm too busy
running this household.\\
151 - You're so lucky, Kitty.
You have it all.\\
152 - A great family
and a great career.\\
153 - How did you talk Red into
letting you work?\\
154 - Okay, well, one day we
sat down, we did all our bills\\
155 - and we realized we were
going to lose the house.\\
156 - This backseat sucks.\\
157 - Plus it's too small.
Fez's leg is touching mine.\\
158 - No. Your leg
is touching mine.\\
159 - I shouldn't even
be in the back seat.\\
160 - You know, I should
be driving my own car.\\
161 - Well, the reason you're not
driving your own car, Forman\\
162 - is because you're irresponsible,
and you scratched it.\\
163 - Yeah. That's
a good one.\\
164 - I'm trying to drive
the car here, man!\\
165 - No. Put it back, I like that song.\\
166 - Pipe down,
now, back seat Charlie.\\
167 - All right.\\
168 - The back seat sucks.\\
169 - Welcome to my sad little world.\\
170 - Oh, great, no pickles.
Now we gotta go back.\\
171 - Shut up!\\
172 - Hey, why does
Sully have a statue\\
173 - of the Virgin Mary
on his dashboard?\\
174 - Maybe he's, like,
religious or something.\\
175 - Wasn't Sully in
prison for arson?\\
176 - Yeah.\\
177 - People who burn stuff
believe in God, too, Hyde.\\
178 - Why does his key
chain say, "I love Bingo"?\\
179 - Sully must love Bingo.\\
180 - All right, I'm starting to think\\
181 - that maybe this
isn't Sully's car.\\
182 - Then whose car is it?\\
183 - Ooh yeah\\
184 - This is great.
I'm dead.\\
185 - You know, when we were in my
car, and I was running the show\\
186 - I don't remember one
single time we all got arrested.\\
187 - That's true.\\
188 - Eric, will you just relax?
We're all in trouble here.\\
189 - Oh, no, no, no.
No-no-no.\\
190 - We're not all in trouble here.\\
191 - Your parents have seven kids.\\
192 - They won't even
notice you're gone.\\
193 - Your parents don't even
live in this country.\\
194 - And your mom,
probably one cell over.\\
195 - So, that just leaves me.\\
196 - I'm the only one who's
really in trouble here.\\
197 - Look, Forman, I'll be in
as much trouble as you are\\
198 - as soon as Edna sobers up.\\
199 - I will be deported.\\
200 - They're gonna send me back to\\
201 - my homeland, the
beautiful island of...\\
202 - Okay, who's the ringleader here?\\
203 - He is.\\
204 - You get one phone call.\\
205 - To anywhere?\\
206 - One local phone call.\\
207 - So,
who should we call?\\
208 - I'd call Red, but
I feel safer in jail.\\
209 - I, um, don't know
my phone number.\\
210 - I can't call Edna, man.
It's poker night.\\
211 - No offense, but isn't every
night poker night for Edna?\\
212 - No, no, n. I got
it. I'll call Jackie.\\
213 - Her dad's a lawyer,
and she's got a checkbook.\\
214 - Hello?\\
215 - Jackie! Oh, thank
God you're home.\\
216 - I was driving a stolen
car and I got arrested.\\
217 - Oh, Michael, this is just
like the book Prisoner of Love\\
218 - where Cliff,
the rugged yet sweet\\
219 - motorcycle mechanic
was thrown into jail.\\
220 - And then his true love, Tasha,\\
221 - was forced to be
a slave girl but for this\\
222 - really rich, mean guy.\\
223 - Jackie, I'm not kidding
around. I'm really in jail.\\
224 - Oh, my God.
Are you okay?\\
225 - Yeah, I guess.
But I'm a little cold.\\
226 - It's lonely in
the joint, Jackie.\\
227 - Oh, my God.
You're really in jail.\\
228 - What if you never get out?\\
229 - That would really suck.\\
230 - Yes, it would, Michael.
And I promise\\
231 - the minute you
get out of prison,\\
232 - I'm gonna prove my love to you.\\
233 - Cool. Thanks.\\
234 - Michael, do you even know
what I'm saying to you?\\
235 - Yeah.\\
236 - No.\\
237 - We're gonna make love,
you idiot.\\
238 - All right!\\
239 - You two have a nice little talk?\\
240 - Oh, yeah.\\
241 - You know what's funny?\\
242 - What?\\
243 - Nothing! Because you forgot
to ask her for help, you moron!\\
244 - My God, you're right.\\
245 - Give me another dime.\\
246 - We only had one dime.\\
247 - We only got one phone call.\\
248 - Oh, my God.\\
249 - Somebody give me a spoon.\\
250 - I'm gonna dig my
way out of here.\\
251 - Look at this. Here we
are, sitting down to dinner\\
252 - and Eric's not even home yet.\\
253 - Well, honey, you
took away his car.\\
254 - He has to walk everywhere.\\
255 - Walking is good for him.\\
256 - Red, why do you have
to be so hard on him?\\
257 - Same reason my old
man was hard on me.\\
258 - To prepare me for the world.\\
259 - You know, Kitty,
when I was his age...\\
260 - I could have parachuted
onto a deserted island\\
261 - with nothing but a Swiss army
knife, and I would've survived.\\
262 - Oh, okay, then we've learned
something. No skydiving for Eric.\\
263 - I'll tell you, Kitty,
the world is a tough place.\\
264 - You drop your
guard for one second...\\
265 - and it'll kick you
right in the ass.\\
266 - Well, you're right.\\
267 - Red, the world is hard.\\
268 - So wouldn't it be nice if Eric
came home to a place that wasn't?\\
269 - All right, Kitty.\\
270 - When you win the lottery...\\
271 - you can buy him Disneyland.\\
272 - I can't believe she
went to that class.\\
273 - Married women do not
abandon their families.\\
274 - Sure they do, Dad.
It's the '70s.\\
275 - I know what decade it is.\\
276 - Doesn't change
the fact I'm eating\\
277 - a sandwich
instead of a hot meal.\\
278 - Well, you want me to
microwave it for you?\\
279 - I just don't understand
why she needs this.\\
280 - I've given her a great life.\\
281 - Dad, that's not the issue.\\
282 - The whole point of the
Equal Rights Amendment\\
283 - is so that women don't have
to define themselves by a man.\\
284 - Donna, is this about clothes?\\
285 - 'Cause I can buy you clothes.\\
286 - This is pointless.\\
287 - Hey, while you're up,
you wanna get Daddy a beer?\\
288 - Honey?\\
289 - Eric, you've gotta
do something, man.\\
290 - Me? What about you,
Kelso? Or Hyde?\\
291 - I can't talk to cops, man.
I go insane with rage.\\
292 - Oh. And me, too.
Nuts.\\
293 - Eric, you gotta help us.\\
294 - So now I'm back in charge?\\
295 - This is so typical.\\
296 - Okay, you know what? Fine.\\
297 - Once again, I'll suck it up,\\
298 - be the man and save
all your sorry asses.\\
299 - Officer, I need to
talk to you, please.\\
300 - You gotta let me go!\\
301 - Please, God.
My dad's gonna kill me.\\
302 - You stole a car, kid.\\
303 - What kind of cop would I be
if I just let you go?\\
304 - My best friend the cop?\\
305 - Look, it really wasn't my fault.
We borrowed it from a friend.\\
306 - Yeah, haven't heard that
one before. Guess what?\\
307 - They didn't
really steal the car.\\
308 - They borrowed it from a friend.\\
309 - Well, actually, they did.
Turns out this guy Sully\\
310 - borrowed it from his grandmother\\
311 - and she forgot and
called it in stolen.\\
312 - Nice old lady, though.
She plays Bingo.\\
313 - Oh, my God, this is great.
So, we're free to go?\\
314 - Yeah. Which one are you?\\
315 - Eric Forman.\\
316 - Forman? Is your
dad Red Forman?\\
317 - Uh, yeah.\\
318 - You poor bastard.\\
319 - Well, thank you.
Here.\\
320 - So?
So.\\
321 - So call a cab.
We're sprung.\\
322 - What? We're free?\\
323 - All charges dropped.\\
324 - Wait, that is what
you wanted, right?\\
325 - Let's get
the hell out of here.\\
326 - Yeah.\\
327 - Oh.\\
328 - Hi, Bob.\\
329 - Midge, I, uh,
I've been thinking.\\
330 - If taking that class made you
happy, then I guess I'm happy.\\
331 - Oh, sweetie, it
means so much to me.\\
332 - And it's only twice
a week, so it's not...\\
333 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
334 - I thought this
was a one-time deal.\\
335 - Bob, you can't learn total\\
336 - female empowerment in one night.\\
337 - It takes 10 nights.\\
338 - Wait. Uh-uh. Midge,
you are not going back.\\
339 - Aphrodite, the Goddess
of War wouldn't take this\\
340 - and neither will I!\\
341 - Hey, Dad.
Hold it.\\
342 - About the car.\\
343 - I know it was...\\
344 - And I, uh...\\
345 - You see, when I was a kid, uh...\\
346 - Maybe I came down...\\
347 - Um. Here's the keys.\\
348 - Thank you, sir.\\
349 - So where you been
all night? Prison.\\
350 - Yeah, okay.\\
351 - Jackie.\\
352 - Michael, you've been sprung.\\
353 - Oh!\\
354 - You don't know what it's
like on the inside, Jackie.\\
355 - Did they beat you?\\
356 - Yeah.\\
357 - Damn those police.\\
358 - Oh, no. It was Hyde.
But he really frogged me.\\
359 - Oh, poor baby.\\
360 - Thanks, Jackie.\\
361 - Okay, so let's do this thing.\\
362 - Oh! This is so perfect.\\
363 - I don't even miss the peignoir,\\
364 - the pirate shirt, or the wind.\\
365 - What about the banner?\\
366 - It's okay.\\
367 - The important thing is,
I'm here with you.\\
368 - And I'm prepared to
give myself to you...\\
369 - body, mind, and soul.\\
370 - Michael, this is going to be the
most magical night of our lives.\\

372 - My parents are at the A&P,\\
373 - so we only have,
like, 15 minutes.\\
374 - You guys enjoying your burgers?\\
375 - Got enough pickles on them?\\

Burger does them.\\
377 - Lots and lots
of pickles. Yes, yes.\\
378 - Yeah.
It's great.\\
379 - Got enough room back there?\\
380 - Uh, actually, it's a
little bit crowded.\\
381 - Good. That's the way

\subsection {Episode 15: That Wrestling Show}
1 - You and Jackie did not do it.\\
2 - No. We so did it.\\
3 - You're always
saying that you did it.\\
4 - Kelso, she wears the pants,
and they have never come off.\\
5 - Look at my face. This
is a face that did it.\\
6 - Holy smokes, I think he did it.\\
7 - Kelso did it!\\
8 - I
did it! I did it! I did it!\\
9 - Yeah.
Congratulations, man.\\
10 - Plus, you did it in record time.\\
11 - Yeah, you think?\\
12 - No, you moron. You've been
kissing her ass for over a year.\\
13 - Yeah, but that's over, man.\\
14 - It's hard to explain to you kids\\
15 - that have never
had sex before...\\
16 - but when you're with a woman,\\
17 - something chemical
happens to her.\\
18 - Now, Jackie is totally different.
She's like my love slave.\\
19 - Oh, yeah, I'm that
good.\\
20 - Hey, guys.\\
21 - Hi, sweetie.
How are you?\\
22 - Well, actually,
I'm a little bit chilly.\\
23 - But I left my
coat up in the car.\\
24 - I'll go get
it for you. Miss me.\\
25 - Handy little thing, isn't she?\\
26 - Okay, that was so cool.\\
27 - Cool? And by "cool" I
mean "wrong and stupid."\\
28 - All right, shut up.
Wrestling's back on.\\
29 - Oh, I love wrestling!\\
30 - Come on, you're not
even fighting back.\\
31 - Why would he fight back?\\
32 - Don't forget,
this Saturday night...\\
33 - pro wrestling is coming...\\
34 - to the National Guard Armory
in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\\
35 - Watch Rocky Johnson
take on 20 snarling midgets.\\
36 - Now, back to the action.\\
37 - Rocky Johnson's coming to
Kenosha? Oh, man, we gotta go.\\
38 - I'm in.
I love midgets, man.\\
39 - Eric, I need
to see you up here.\\
40 - Okay, I'll be right up.\\
41 - You are not going up?\\
42 - I'll go up when I'm ready.\\
43 - Oh!\\
44 - So I just said to myself,\\
45 - "I don't care if all I have
is dirty laundry and no money.\\
46 - "I'm going home
to see my parents.\\
47 - "Because I love
them very much."\\
48 - Aw...\\
49 - Oh, my.\\
50 - Oh, well, will
you look at these?\\
51 - Yeah, Mom, all the
girls are wearing them.\\
52 - Eric, where have you been?\\
53 - Yeah, Eric, I called
you five minutes ago.\\
54 - I was watching wrestling.\\
55 - Did you take those books back
to the library like I asked you?\\
56 - Uh, yeah.
I took them back.\\
57 - Then why did I see them
in the backseat of your car?\\
58 - I took them back to the car.\\
59 - Which means that they're
practically at the library.\\
60 - You know, Dad, I feel
sorry for all the good kids...\\
61 - who wanted to read those books.\\
62 - That's who I feel sorry for.\\
63 - Okay, it's five books.
A nickel a book.\\
64 - Uh, big deal, I'm out a quarter.\\
65 - It's not about the money, son.\\
66 - It's about the rules.\\
67 - And without rules, we might
as well all be up in a tree\\
68 - flinging our crap at each other.\\
69 - Uh... Okay.\\
70 - The library closes in a half an
hour, so get your ass over there.\\
71 - Dad, you know, all my
friends are downstairs so...\\
72 - Hey, hey, hey pal,
I'm not the bad guy here.\\
73 - Now, you screwed yourself\\
74 - when you didn't
return those books.\\
75 - Now go.\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - No.\\
78 - Did you say, "no"?\\
79 - Are you telling me, "no"?\\
80 - Is that what I'm hearing?\\
81 - Yeah.\\
82 - Oh, dear.\\
83 - Hanging out\\
84 - Down the street\\
85 - The same old thing\\
86 - We did last week\\
87 - Not a thing to do\\
88 - But talk to you\\
89 - Whoa, yeah\\
90 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
91 - Well, all right!\\
92 - You know what's interesting?\\
93 - No.\\
94 - When you talk to Laurie, you
actually have a conversation\\
95 - but with Eric,
you just give orders.\\
96 - Kitty, he said no to me.\\
97 - Well, he's getting older, Red.\\
98 - I think it's time you two
developed a friendship...\\
99 - 'cause if you don't,
he'll move away\\
100 - and we'll never see him again.\\
101 - Is that what you want?\\
102 - Red.\\
103 - I can't be friends with Eric.\\
104 - He's too twitchy.\\
105 - Red, until I see you
make some kind of effort\\
106 - I'm just gonna
keep bringing it up.\\
107 - Threats aren't
gonna work, Kitty.\\
108 - In the middle of every
newspaper you're reading\\
109 - every nap you're taking, every
football game you're watching,\\
110 - I'll be there talking,
talking, talking.\\
111 - Bob, I'm thinking
of starting therapy.\\
112 - Okay, I'm gonna be...\\
113 - Bye.\\
114 - Therapy?
That's for crazies.\\
115 - You know, the unexamined
self is an unfulfilled self.\\
116 - How can you be unfulfilled?\\
117 - I put a roof over your head,\\
118 - I pay the bills,
I take care of you.\\
119 - Yeah, but what do I do?\\
120 - You fill out that
sweater real nice.\\
121 - You are so...\\
122 - cold!\\
123 - What? That's a compliment.\\
124 - Sit down, Laurie,
have some ribs.\\
125 - Mom, you know I'm on
my water and yogurt diet.\\
126 - Okay, well, isn't this nice?\\
127 - My whole family
together. Mostly.\\
128 - Having family fun. Because
that's what dinner is for.\\
129 - Right, Red?\\
130 - Okay, uh...\\
131 - So. Eric...\\
132 - what happened at school today?\\
133 - Why? What'd you hear?\\
134 - What's wrong with you?\\
135 - I can't ask a simple question?\\
136 - Red, you need some potatoes.\\
137 - Um...\\
138 - Good job on
returning those books.\\
139 - Well, yeah,
I returned the books.\\
140 - Even though it
was kind of stupid.\\
141 - What?\\
142 - He said it was stupid, Daddy.\\
143 - Okay. Okay.\\
144 - Eric, what are you
gonna do this weekend?\\
145 - Oh, me and the gang
are gonna catch\\
146 - that wrestling match in Kenosha.\\
147 - Oh, well, now,
isn't that something?\\
148 - Because a certain
Mr. Red Forman\\
149 - used to wrestle in high school.\\
150 - No. What I did
then was real.\\
151 - That stuff on TV, that's,
uh, that's all an act.\\
152 - Oh, I don't know.\\
153 - I bet if the two of
you went together,\\
154 - you'd really enjoy yourselves.\\
155 - Right, guys?\\
156 - No, Mom, I don't...
I'm really busy...\\
157 - Okay.\\
158 - So, you're going.\\
159 - And I think everyone
has room to grow...\\
160 - but Bob is perfectly satisfied\\
161 - and says just being his
wife should make me happy.\\
162 - Midge, let me
stop you right there.\\
163 - I know we've had only one
session, but from what I'm hearing,\\
164 - everything you say
is completely right\\
165 - and everything Bob says
is completely wrong.\\
166 - I think I'm gonna like
therapy.\\
167 - I think therapy's
gonna like you.\\
168 - Jackie, what are you doing
here? You hate wrestling.\\
169 - Michael likes it, and anything
that Michael likes, I like.\\
170 - 'Cause I like Michael.\\
171 - Yeah, that's my girl.\\
172 - Oh, barf.\\
173 - Come on,
watch your legs.\\
174 - Taking the gang to
the wrestling matches?\\
175 - I guess I'll just
sit home alone tonight\\
176 - since Midge is going
to some therapy thing.\\
177 - I'll be alone.\\
178 - Get in the car, Bob.\\
179 - Eric,
give me the keys.\\
180 - Why can't I drive?\\
181 - Because I want to
get there in one piece.\\
182 - Hey, can we get a move on, huh?\\
183 - If I miss that
20-midget free-for-all,\\
184 - I'm gonna be super pissed.\\
185 - Fine. You drive.\\
186 - Red.\\
187 - You know, on second
thought, um, you should drive.\\
188 - After all, tonight I'm
just one of the gang.\\
189 - This isn't gonna work, you know?\\
190 - We're gonna kill each other.\\
191 - Fine, kill each other.
Just do it together.\\
192 - Both hands on the wheel, Eric.\\
193 - Ten and two.
Ten and two!\\
194 - Dad, if you want to drive...\\
195 - No, no, no, that's all right.\\
196 - I'm just one of the gang. KELSO:
Comin' in, with the big elbow!\\
197 - Yield, damn it!
That sign says, "yield."\\
198 - Ah!\\
199 - That's better.\\
200 - Baby, baby, baby,
baby, oh\\
201 - This is ridiculous.\\
202 - When we get home tonight\\
203 - you better tell your mother
we had a damn good time.\\
204 - Well, so far so good.\\
205 - Yeah, yeah.\\
206 - And now, I gotta go and
spend $2 for a 10-cent beer.\\
207 - Gee, I'm so glad our dads came.\\
208 - At least yours is
leaving you alone.\\
209 - Yeah.\\
210 - Poor Fez, huh?
Yeah.\\
211 - There I was
sitting in the kitchen.\\
212 - Sitting in the kitchen,
when, boom!\\
213 - She tells me she needs therapy.\\
214 - Yeah, Midge and I had
a beautiful thing, Fezzy...\\
215 - then it all went wrong.\\
216 - Yeah, Bob, women
are hell.\\
217 - Why don't you grab us all
a beer and we'll talk it over?\\
218 - I could get you sodas,
'cause I know you're underage.\\
219 - Bob, this isn't about us.\\
220 - It's about you.\\
221 - And you need friends.
And beer.\\
222 - Hey, how stupid
do you think I am?\\
223 - Why don't we grab a beer
and we'll talk it over?\\
224 - Ah...\\
225 - No.\\
226 - Well, then, Bob,
you're on your own.\\
227 - See how you drive people away?\\
228 - I'm telling you, after
my therapy session,\\
229 - I felt so loose.\\
230 - Loose is good.\\
231 - If you ask me, we could
all do with a little tightening.\\
232 - And, and tonight, my therapist
is hosting an encounter group...\\
233 - but I'm too shy to go alone.\\
234 - Oh, well, too bad.\\
235 - Oh, Kitty, please come with me.\\
236 - I don't think so.
No, thank you. No.\\
237 - You know what
this is a lot like?\\
238 - Like when you asked me to
help you host the bake sale.\\
239 - Only it's different,
because I said yes.\\
240 - All right.\\
241 - Ooh! Great.\\
242 - It's a gathering of his souls
in progress. Over drinks.\\
243 - Free drinks? I'm in.\\
244 - Oh, that's nice. That's
music to a mother's ears.\\
245 - Okay, what's going on here?\\
246 - Okay, you see the guy getting in
the ring? That's Rocky Johnson.\\
247 - Man, he's the best.\\
248 - The best?\\
249 - They're not even fighters.
I mean, it's all tricks.\\
250 - I could get up
there right now and...\\
251 - Goddam!\\
252 - He dropped that guy
right on his head!\\
253 - Yeah!\\
254 - That's right. I got him.
He ain't going anywhere.\\
255 - One, two, three.\\
256 - The winner!\\
257 - Get off me!
I'm the winner here.\\
258 - Yeah!\\
259 - Man!\\
260 - It's hot in here, huh?\\
261 - You poor thing.\\
262 - Is that better, sweetie?\\
263 - Oh. Yeah!\\
264 - Jackie, can I talk
to you for a second?\\
265 - Yeah, sure.\\
266 - Michael, is it okay...
Ow!\\
267 - Jackie, what the hell is going
on between you and Kelso?\\
268 - Look, Michael Kelso and I
have made beautiful love.\\
269 - Ew!\\
270 - I mean... No.\\
271 - Ew.\\
272 - Why are you
being such a doormat?\\
273 - Look, I have to be nice.\\
274 - What if he gets bored now?\\
275 - Bored? Jackie, he's gonna
want to do it again.\\
276 - So what you're saying is,
I'm totally in charge.\\
277 - Well, I mean, a partnership...\\
278 - No, no, no. I own
him! I am the man.\\
279 - Well, Jackie...\\
280 - No, no!
Thank you, Donna.\\
281 - Good evening, sir.
I would like a refreshing\\
282 - cola, please.\\
283 - And
get me a beer, son.\\
284 - Okay, Dad, sure.
And a beer for my dad.\\
285 - You're not gonna
get me that beer, are you?\\
286 - What seems to
be the problem, son?\\
287 - What're you doing?
Don't just sit there!\\
288 - Get up, you big moose!
Look, he's laughing at you!\\
289 - I give and I give and I give!\\
290 - Oh, boo-hoo.
Get back in the ring!\\
291 - Come on.\\
292 - Hey, this is fun.\\
293 - Hey, Rocky Johnson. Mr. Johnson,
sir, can I get your autograph?\\
294 - Rocky!\\
295 - Eric, go in there
and get your autograph.\\
296 - No way, Dad. The sign
says, "wrestlers only."\\
297 - So?\\
298 - So, that's a rule.\\
299 - As I remember, a great
man once said to me,\\
300 - "If we were to break the rules,\\
301 - "the world would just be filled\\
302 - "with tree-climbing
crapflingers."\\
303 - Yeah. Follow me. You
want your autograph or not?\\
304 - There he is.\\
305 - Mr. Johnson, you gave that team
of midgets an ass whupping, sir!\\
306 - You pile drive a little guy\\
307 - and the whole
crowd turns on you.\\
308 - When you're standing
there, wondering\\
309 - what they're booing about...\\
310 - you get bit on the
kneecaps. Look at my knees.\\
311 - Midget bites.\\
312 - I wonder if you'd mind
giving my son an autograph.\\
313 - No. No autographs.\\
314 - Look, pal...\\
315 - I might be the only guy in here\\
316 - who's actually killed a man.\\
317 - Give the kid an autograph.
And then, no more autographs.\\
318 - That's really nice. Bringing
your kid to a wrestling match.\\
319 - You know, I've got a son.\\
320 - And one day, he's gonna
become the most electrifying man\\
321 - in sports entertainment.\\
322 - Yeah, good luck with that.\\
323 - Uh, wanna make that
out to Red Forman?\\
324 - No, no, I don't think so.\\
325 - Um, it's Eric Forman.
Capital E-R-I-C.\\
326 - Yeah, but see,
his nickname is Red.\\
327 - No, it's not, it's Eric.\\
328 - Stop
kidding around, Red!\\
329 - You know, babe, a soda would
taste pretty good right about now.\\
330 - Yeah, you're right. A soda
does sound pretty good.\\
331 - I'll have a diet.\\
332 - Yeah, I'll have a root beer.\\
333 - Uh. Don't you want to
go get it for me?\\
334 - Sweetie?\\
335 - Okay, let me
clear it up for you.\\
336 - Hmm?\\
337 - Get me a soda.\\
338 - Now!\\
339 - Did you see that?
I'm the man.\\
340 - It all started
about six months ago...\\
341 - when Midgie got
a subscription to Cosmo.\\
342 - These group sessions...\\
343 - are about testing
your boundaries...\\
344 - losing your inhibitions,\\
345 - and really sharing
with the group.\\
346 - Kitty, are you ready?\\
347 - Oh, uh, well...\\
348 - Share a little, Mom.\\
349 - Tell us how folding
the dishtowels just right\\
350 - makes all our problems go away.\\
351 - You want me to share?\\
352 - Okay.\\
353 - Laurie, you're mean
to your brother\\
354 - and you're screwing
around at college.\\
355 - We don't even see you unless
you run out of clean clothes\\
356 - or need cash.\\
357 - The fact is, you're an
ungrateful, spoiled brat.\\
358 - Well, thank you. That
was nice.\\
359 - I love you, honey.\\
360 - Well, I hope
you're all as excited\\
361 - about this journey as I am.\\
362 - Let's pair off.\\
363 - Okay, okay, we're leaving.\\
364 - I don't get it, Kitty.
What's going on?\\
365 - I'll tell you what's going
on. He's a bad doctor.\\
366 - A very bad doctor.\\
367 - Hey, Dad, thanks for
letting me drive home.\\
368 - Thanks for not killing me.\\
369 - You know, I just had a lot
of fun tonight with you, Dad.\\
370 - Yeah, me too.\\
371 - All right, let's go.\\
372 - Want some, huh?
Yeah.\\
373 - I wanna have a piece. Huh?\\
374 - Yes! Who's
the king? Who's the king?\\
375 - Ahh! My neck!\\
376 - Oh. Gosh, Dad,
I'm sorry.\\
377 - I'm so sorry.
Look, I had no...\\
378 - Now who's the king, huh?\\
379 - You are.\\
380 - Mmm-mmm.\\
381 - And it turned out this therapist
was just obsessed with sex.\\
382 - And this is a really
difficult time for me.\\
383 - The last thing I need is a doctor
who doesn't take me seriously.\\
384 - I need to find
someone I can talk to,\\
385 - Hmm. someone
who will really listen.\\
386 - So. Wanna go
to a party?\\
387 - Okay.
\subsection {Episode 16: The First Date}
1 - - Ow, get off me,
you moose.
- Oh, God,\\
2 - Eric, I didn't see
you sitting there.\\
3 - You should really
work on bulking up.\\
4 - Maybe you should
really work on bulking up.\\
5 - What are you watching?\\
6 - Hey, Gilligan is on.\\
7 - What are you doing in the floor?\\
8 - Yeah. Why don't
you guys get a room?\\
9 - We have a room, Hyde.
It's called my basement.\\
10 - Well, I'm going home.\\
11 - Bye, guys.\\
12 - Oh, so, Donna, don't forget.
I'll see you\\
13 - tomorrow night
at the library, right?\\
14 - - Yeah, right.
- I'll walk you home.\\
15 - She lives right next door, man.\\
16 - Yeah.\\
17 - Donna, um, about tomorrow night.\\
18 - I was thinking that maybe
you and I could go out to dinner.\\
19 - For Valentine's Day?\\
20 - Oh... Hyde asked me to
study at the library.\\
21 - Well, I mean, you can
do that anytime, right?\\
22 - Um, yeah.
Yeah, I'd love to go.\\
23 - Mmm-hmm.\\
24 - That's great.
Um...\\
25 - So, then it's a...
It's a date.\\
26 - Our first.\\
27 - Yeah, if you don't count
all the times I mauled you.\\
28 - Yeah. Um...
Which I don't, so...\\
29 - Hey, guys.\\
30 - So, what's going on?\\
31 - I'll, uh, talk
to you guys later.\\
32 - So, Eric...\\
33 - what were you and Donna
talking all hot and heavy about?\\
34 - - Your hair.
- Really?\\
35 - No.\\
36 - We're going out to dinner
tomorrow night. For Valentine's Day.\\
37 - Uh, no, no, no.\\
38 - Donna and I are going to the
library to study tomorrow night.\\
39 - On Valentine's Day? Who
studies on Valentine's Day?\\
40 - Well, I didn't know it was
Valentine's Day when I made the date.\\
41 - To study.\\
42 - Well, I'm sure she
just forgot about you.\\
43 - We just talked
about it a minute ago.\\
44 - Women. You know,
I mean...\\
45 - Anyway, uh, I'm gonna
give Donna my class ring.\\
46 - No, forget rings.\\
47 - You wanna score with Donna,
use my super funk eight-track.\\
48 - Anyway, I figure it's time
to make it official.\\
49 - I mean, she's just been waiting\\
50 - for any jerk to
swoop down on her.\\
51 - And you're that jerk.\\
52 - Well, better me than
some other jerk.\\
53 - Why are you looking at me?
Hyde is the other jerk.\\
54 - Hanging out\\
55 - Down the street\\
56 - The same old thing\\
57 - We did last week\\
58 - Not a thing to do\\
59 - But talk to you\\
60 - Whoa, yeah\\
61 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
62 - So,\\
63 - if Eric and Donna are
going out Saturday night\\
64 - that means we have no wheels.\\
65 - Well, I can borrow my dad's car.\\
66 - Ooh!\\
67 - It's a Lincoln.
Leather.\\
68 - Oh! You know what
we should do?\\
69 - We should ditch Hyde and Fez
and make out in the backseat.\\
70 - You said that out loud.\\
71 - Yeah, I don't care.\\
72 - Hey, yeah, I know.\\
73 - We can go shopping for clogs.\\
74 - Pick me up at 7:00.\\
75 - Hey, well, have fun,
man. I'm out.\\
76 - Oh, we won't be shopping.\\
77 - We'll be doing it.
Again.\\
78 - 'Cause that's what we do.
We do it!\\
79 - Then I'm in.\\
80 - Uh, no, you're not invited, Fez.\\
81 - Oh. Then I'm out.\\
82 - Yeah. Well, later.\\
83 - Well, It looks like it's just you
and me, little buddy.\\
84 - Yeah, Fez.
Which is really wrong, man\\
85 - 'cause I had plans with
Donna. Until Forman snaked me.\\
86 - Who would have thought\\
87 - she would rather go
to a nice restaurant\\
88 - than a smelly, old library?\\
89 - You will laugh later.\\
90 - So, let me see.\\
91 - Go ahead, show your mother.\\
92 - Oh, my gosh, that is snazzy.\\
93 - That is a snazzy jacket.\\
94 - Damn good thing I went with him.\\
95 - He wanted to buy
a leisure suit.\\
96 - Oh, come on, Dad. Leisure suits
are cool. Everybody wears them.\\
97 - Leisure suits are for
dumbasses. Believe me.\\
98 - Hey, there, Eric.\\
99 - Ooh. Looking sharp for your
big date, huh?\\
100 - Oh, who knew
our two little tykes\\
101 - would grow up
to be dating.\\
102 - Oh, no. I have an idea.\\
103 - Let's have dinner tomorrow
night. Just the parents.\\
104 - I'll fondue.\\
105 - Oh, yeah.\\
106 - And that'll give us a chance
to talk about their future.\\
107 - Oh, right.\\
108 - We can plan
a big wedding.\\
109 - I know you're joking, but, uh,\\
110 - could you please
stop? Please?\\
111 - You know, I've...\\
112 - You can borrow our car.\\
113 - Girls love corsages.\\
114 - They got a fried onion brick
at The Vineyard, right?\\
115 - I don't believe you, Michael.\\
116 - What?\\
117 - You can't just maul me
in front of my father.\\
118 - I bet he didn't even notice.\\
119 - He yelled at you to stop it.\\
120 - Oh.\\
121 - I thought he was talking to you.\\
122 - Okay.
Michael, we have a problem.\\
123 - Ever since we...\\
124 - - We...
- Did it?\\
125 - Ugh.\\
126 - Can you please use
a more beautiful term?\\
127 - Like what?\\
128 - Well, like, proved our love.\\
129 - Yeah. But "Did it"
sounds so much cooler.\\
130 - Okay, just take me to the mall.\\
131 - We're not really
going shopping, are we?\\
132 - Yes, I need clogs.\\
133 - Oh.\\
134 - God darn!
That is a snazzy jacket.\\
135 - Yes, sir. Brown is your color.\\
136 - Thanks, Dad.\\
137 - No, no, no. no, Mom.
No, no.\\
138 - Let me tell you something,
order the dinner.\\
139 - A la carte's a sucker's bet.
And remember...\\
140 - pull the chair out for her.\\
141 - The small fork is for the salad.\\
142 - And this jacket's gotta last you\\
143 - all the way through college\\
144 - so don't spill any crap on it.\\
145 - Here you go. Have fun.\\
146 - - Oh!
- Aw!\\
147 - Yeah.\\
148 - - Shall we?
- Good God, yes.\\
149 - Oh! Smile.\\
150 - Oh, now,
if she gets to do it,\\
151 - I get to do it.\\
152 - Kitty, he's leaving.\\
153 - Wow, talk about pressure, huh?\\
154 - Yeah, I mean,
this is a huge deal.\\
155 - To our parents.\\
156 - Move it in, move it out\\
157 - Shove it in, shove it out\\
158 - Disco\\
159 - Hey, you got me so set\\
160 - Here in this discotheque\\
161 - Girl, you're movin' me\\
162 - So what do you wanna do?\\
163 - I don't know, man.
What do you want to do?\\
164 - Oh, let's go to The Hub.\\
165 - I've got my eye
on this plump girl.\\
166 - Sounds good, man, but I'll pass.\\
167 - Poor Hyde.\\
168 - What?\\
169 - You love Donna, and she's
with your good friend Eric.\\
170 - And?\\
171 - And that's the oldest
story in the world.\\
172 - And a sad one at that.\\
173 - You know what, man? I had
a chance, and I didn't take it.\\
174 - And once Forman
gives her that ring, man,\\
175 - they're going out.\\
176 - And it would be really scummy
to hit on her then.\\
177 - Not that I wouldn't do it.
It'd just be really scummy.\\
178 - If you don't tell
Donna how you feel,\\
179 - then you will regret it.\\
180 - - I'm going to The Vineyard.
- Good for you.\\
181 - Oh. Just don't tell
Eric what I said\\
182 - because I really
like his basement.\\
183 - Well, this is quite a menu.\\
184 - Tsk. Yeah.\\
185 - You got enough money?\\
186 - Oh, yeah, for me.\\
187 - Oh, I'm sorry. Were you
gonna eat something, too?\\
188 - Actually, uh,
I'm in the mood for chicken.\\
189 - Oh, what a coincidence.
I, too, am ordering\\
190 - the cheapest thing on the menu.\\
191 - You look really nice tonight.\\
192 - Uh, so do you.\\
193 - Look, Donna...\\
194 - Hello! Uh, can I start
you folks off with drinks?\\
195 - Well, sure...\\
196 - I'll have a beer.\\
197 - All right.\\
198 - Um, I'd like an iced tea.\\
199 - He didn't even proof me.\\
200 - It must be the jacket.\\
201 - - Or my sideburns.
- What sideburns?\\
202 - These... sideburns...
Right... These sideburns.\\
203 - You know, I don't know
why they call it fondue.\\
204 - They should call it fundue.
'Cause it is fun.\\
205 - I love fondue.
It's gourmet.\\
206 - So, what do we do here, Kitty?\\
207 - Okay, now, um, what you do is,\\
208 - you, um, you put a piece
of steak on your fondue fork.\\
209 - Now, how hot exactly is the...\\
210 - No, no, no Bob.
That's a fondon't.\\
211 - Don't put your
hand in the hot oil.\\
212 - Who knew you couldn't
put your hand in the hot oil?\\
213 - Here, chicken, chicken,
chicken, chicken.\\
214 - Donna, um, shh, please.\\
215 - Oh...
Sorry.\\
216 - Are, are you okay?\\
217 - I am great.\\
218 - I think you're drunk.\\
219 - I think I am, too.\\
220 - Pfft.\\
221 - How could I be drunk?\\
222 - Well, there's about
five shots of alcohol\\
223 - in a Long Island Iced Tea.\\
224 - Wait, Long Island Iced Tea?\\
225 - Yeah, you guys ordered drinks.\\
226 - And I'm ready for another one.\\
227 - Nope, she's good.
We're...\\
228 - Thank you. Thanks.
Thank you. Thanks.\\
229 - I love your little butt, Eric.\\
230 - Oh...\\
231 - It's so little.\\
232 - Okay, um...\\
233 - And you're so good, Eric.
You're so darn good.\\
234 - I think it's coffee time.\\
235 - You're so good, it makes me hot.\\
236 - Or time for
another Iced Tea maybe.\\
237 - Sing to me, Eric.\\
238 - No, I don't think...\\
239 - - Sing me a song.
- I don't really...\\
240 - Do it or I'll scream!\\
241 - Move it in, move it out\\
242 - Shove it in, shove it out\\
243 - Disco lady\\
244 - Move it in, move it out\\
245 - Shove it in, all about\\
246 - Uhh.\\
247 - Well, Jackie.\\
248 - It's now 9:00.\\
249 - Which means that
every shoe store\\
250 - in the greater Oshkosh area
is closed for the night.\\
251 - So... what do you
want to do now?\\
252 - Hey, let's go look at
the new Corvettes.\\
253 - Oh. Yeah...\\
254 - I mean...\\
255 - No.\\
256 - That just sounds boring.\\
257 - Well, what do you wanna do?\\
258 - No, I don't know.\\
259 - Oh. Wait. You know
what we could do?\\
260 - We could...\\
261 - Prove our love to
each other again.\\
262 - No, Michael.
We are not going to...\\
263 - Prove our love, every
single time we have a chance.\\
264 - Why not?\\
265 - Because it
doesn't work like that.\\
266 - And just because we did it once,\\
267 - does not mean
we're ever gonna do it again.\\
268 - Okay, now you're
just talking crazy!\\
269 - No, Michael. No, I am not.\\
270 - And if you think that's how it's\\
271 - gonna work, Michael,
well, then you're wrong.\\
272 - Well, damn, Jackie.\\
273 - So, I spent all night\\
274 - looking for your...
...stupid shoes\\
275 - and we're not even gonna...\\
276 - No.\\
277 - Fine.\\
278 - Are you sure
you're okay with that?\\
279 - Yeah.\\
280 - Okay, let's do it.\\
281 - - Oh, crap.
- Ouch!\\
282 - - Damn!
- Ow!\\
283 - Geez!\\
284 - My eye!\\
285 - God. It's so crowded in here.\\
286 - Eric, meet me under the table.\\
287 - Donna, no. Look...
Well... No.\\
288 - Look, Donna, come on.\\
289 - Uh, waiter? Waiter?\\
290 - Uh...\\
291 - Okay. I'm gonna go
get you some coffee.\\
292 - So, no going under the table,
and no singing.\\
293 - I'll be right back.\\
294 - People, the chicken
here is excellent.\\
295 - Hey! Hyde's here.\\
296 - Hi, Hyde.\\
297 - Hey, Donna.
Uh...\\
298 - Where's Forman?\\
299 - Coffee.\\
300 - Okay, look. I'm just
going to say this, all right?\\
301 - Donna, I have feelings for you.\\
302 - And I think that you
have feelings for me.\\
303 - And Forman's gonna
give you his ring.\\
304 - And I hope that before
you take it, you think about...\\
305 - Beep!\\
306 - Hey, Eric.\\
307 - Hyde's here.\\
308 - Hey, we're on a date here.\\
309 - Yeah, man.
Well, you shouldn't be\\
310 - because we were supposed to be
at the library.\\
311 - Hyde, if she wanted to be at
the library, she'd be at the library.\\
312 - Oh, my God.\\
313 - Oh, my God, wait. What do you
mean by "Oh, my God"?\\
314 - - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.\\
315 - Oh, my God.\\
316 - Look, when my
date's done puking...\\
317 - you better not be here.\\
318 - Excuse me. Hi.\\
319 - Could I get this in
a doggie bag, please?\\
320 - Thanks. Oh and I'm in a hurry.\\
321 - Now...\\
322 - I feel so close to you, Michael.\\
323 - Michael and Jackie.
Jackie and Michael.\\
324 - Doesn't that sound good?
Michael and Jackie.\\
325 - True love, always, forever.\\
326 - - Forever?
- Forever.\\
327 - Dances, long walks...\\
328 - candles, flowers.\\
329 - Babies, house.\\
330 - Shackle, chain...\\
331 - despair, prison, death.\\
332 - Oh!\\
333 - "Jonathan Seagull discovered...\\
334 - "that boredom,
fear, and anger...\\
335 - "are the reasons
a gull's life is so short.\\
336 - "And with this gone
from his thought...\\
337 - "he lived a long,
fine life indeed."\\
338 - Bravo!\\
339 - Ooh. Isn't she a hot tomato?\\
340 - Oh, geez.
To the lovemaking.\\
341 - We had
a wonderful time.\\
342 - My God!\\
343 - Okay, they're gone.\\
344 - They used to be normal.\\
345 - What the hell happened to them?\\
346 - Well, I don't know.\\
347 - How can she not eat meat?
That can't be healthy.\\
348 - Remember when we used
to go on vacation together?\\
349 - Bob and I used to go fishing
and drink beers.\\
350 - I mean, we used to
have fun with them.\\
351 - Now they're into
every fad there is.\\
352 - Things change, Kitty.\\
353 - Well, we don't.\\
354 - Well...\\
355 - We don't have to.\\
356 - We're classic.\\
357 - You know...\\
358 - Midge wasn't
wearing a bra tonight.\\
359 - Yeah.
Bob wasn't wearing underwear.\\
360 - Thanks for, uh, holding
my hair when I was...\\
361 - - Oh.
- Yeah.\\
362 - Just thanks for
missing my shoes.\\
363 - Well I, uh, I guess
I blew our big night.\\
364 - No, no.\\
365 - Look, it's cool. I thought
I was gonna blow it\\
366 - and then, I mean,
you totally blew it.\\
367 - So, I mean, that's great.\\
368 - You know, by telling me
I blew it, you basically\\
369 - just blew it, so...\\
370 - And I was doing
so good here with the\\
371 - jacket and the coffee and\\
372 - holding your hair back.\\
373 - I was so in.\\
374 - You're still in.\\
375 - Look, Donna,
I want to be your boyfriend.\\
376 - And you're all I
ever think about.\\
377 - And will you wear my class ring?\\
378 - - Yes.
- Yes?\\
379 - You know, why don't
we kiss on it later?\\
380 - Oh, right. The vomit.\\
381 - No, wait.
You know what? I don't care.\\
382 - You're my girlfriend.\\
383 - So, Forman, man...\\
384 - I'm sorry about
tonight with Donna.\\
385 - And for taking your dinner.\\
386 - So, are we cool, man?\\
387 - Yeah, man. We've gotta be.\\
388 - Look, we've been friends
since kindergarten.\\
389 - No girl's gonna come between us.\\
390 - That's great, man.\\
391 - So, um...\\
392 - if Donna ever
breaks up with you...\\
393 - and starts dating me,
are we still friends?\\
394 - No.\\
395 - Tonight...\\
396 - ...I learned there's a price
to be paid for doing it.\\
397 - She said, "Forever," man.\\
398 - And I think she meant it.\\
399 - The inside of my
mouth feels like cotton.\\
400 - As if cotton was in my mouth.\\
401 - Kelso, man,
women are like muffins, okay?\\
402 - And once you've
had a muffin, man,\\
403 - you will put up with anything
to have another muffin.\\
404 - And they know that.
Now she really owns you, man.\\
405 - Hyde, you sure know
a lot about women.\\
406 - But, I mean,\\
407 - you've never really
had a steady girlfriend.\\
408 - So... what's that all about?\\
409 - I'll tell you what
that's all about, Forman.\\
410 - My mind is pure, man.\\
411 - I don't fall victim
to the female race.\\
412 - I'm here, sans girlfriend,
to help you guys out.\\
413 - Then I have a question, Hyde.\\
414 - How much masturbation
is too much?\\
415 - No such thing as too much, Fez.\\
416 - How'd it go?\\
417 - It was great.\\
418 - - Oh...
- Gotcha.\\
419 - Anybody, uh, mention how nice
that sport coat was?\\
420 - Donna.\\
421 - There you go.
So, you had fun, huh?\\
422 - Yeah, Dad. Thanks.\\
423 - You know, you got a chunk
of carrot on your shoe there?\\
424 - Yeah, Dad. Thanks.
\subsection {Episode 17: The Pill}
1 - Yeah, that's a good sound.\\
2 - Now, coming up in the second
half-hour of American Bandstand,\\
3 - Shields and Yarnell,
Elton John and Kiki Dee...\\
4 - and now, The Spotlight Dance.\\
5 - This is Mr. Lou Rawls.\\
6 - Jackie! Door! Knock!\\
7 - Sorry. I didn't know
you'd be doing\\
8 - anything so embarrassing.\\
9 - - Um, is Donna here?
- No.\\
10 - Look, I need to talk to someone.\\
11 - I can really use
a friend right now.\\
12 - Okay, then, well,
good luck with that.\\
13 - Eric, can I talk to you?\\
14 - Look, I've always
been able to trust you\\
15 - and, God, you're
such a nice guy.\\
16 - No, I'm not.\\
17 - Yes, you are.\\
18 - Okay. Okay.\\
19 - Um, what happened?\\
20 - Did Kelso forget your birthday
or something?\\
21 - I'm pregnant.\\
22 - Eric, you're like a million
miles away. What's going on?\\
23 - Okay, Donna, I have
to tell you something,\\
24 - but you have to promise you're
not gonna tell anybody else.\\
25 - Dirt! I swear. Now tell me.\\
26 - Not here.\\
27 - Hanging out\\
28 - Down the street\\
29 - The same old thing\\
30 - We did last week\\
31 - Not a thing to do\\
32 - But talk to you\\
33 - Whoa, yeah\\
34 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
35 - Of course I support
the Wolverines.\\
36 - I have to. I'm a
cheerleader, not a cheer-liar.\\
37 - And then, in the dream,\\
38 - two of The Three Stooges
fed me grapes...\\
39 - while I played
them a beautiful song\\
40 - on my accordion...\\
41 - In the nude.\\
42 - Somehow the accordion part
bothers me more\\
43 - than the nude part.\\
44 - - Michael, stop it!
- What'd I do?\\
45 - Look, I just need all the food
I can get right now.\\
46 - Hi.\\
47 - Uh, I have to go
to the bathroom.\\
48 - Jackie?\\
49 - Oh, my God.\\
50 - Donna, you have never asked me\\
51 - to go to the bathroom
with you before.\\
52 - Yeah, it's a big day.\\
53 - Man, she has been
acting so weird lately.\\
54 - I'm telling you, guys, I think
it's time I break up with her.\\
55 - Oh, that's real nice.
Why don't you grow up?\\
56 - So... is it true?\\
57 - Yes, Donna, it is true.\\
58 - I am carrying
Michael Kelso's child.\\
59 - Jackie, you're a sophomore.
How can you be so stupid?\\
60 - I'm a sophomore.\\
61 - Why didn't you, like, you
know, use something?\\
62 - Look, I would have...\\
63 - but my cousin Carla told me\\
64 - that I could not get pregnant\\
65 - for eight days after my period.\\
66 - Okay.\\
67 - Eight days after your
first day or your last day?\\
68 - I don't know.
Carla never called me back.\\
69 - Oh, my God, Donna,
having this child\\
70 - is gonna ruin my whole life.\\
71 - Well, yeah.\\
72 - God, I'll have to wear flats,\\
73 - I'll gain weight,
I'll be too fat to cheer.\\
74 - Not to mention the fact you'll
have a baby to take care of.\\
75 - Donna, what am I
gonna do? I'm in such trouble.\\
76 - Jackie, it's all right.
We'll get through this.\\
77 - What does Kelso
say about all this?\\
78 - No! No, no, no,
I cannot tell Michael.\\
79 - - It's way too embarrassing.
- Jackie!\\
80 - You had sex with him.\\
81 - I know I did.
But we didn't talk.\\
82 - You have to tell Kelso.\\
83 - If you don't, I will.\\
84 - Thank you, Donna.
Thank you! Oh, thank you!\\
85 - Jackie, I don't
want to tell him.\\
86 - I think he knows.\\
87 - - What?
- Nothing, nothing.\\
88 - We're, we're just
a little surprised\\
89 - that you're home, that's all.\\
90 - It's no big deal.\\
91 - You know, I just
didn't feel like going away\\
92 - for spring break.\\
93 - Honey, is there a warrant
out for you in Fort Lauderdale?\\
94 - Now, Kitty,
I'm sure she's just home to...\\
95 - spend time with us and Eric.\\
96 - Why are you home?\\
97 - Daddy, it was just
a very, very tough quarter.\\
98 - Well, I'm sure you'll come
through with flying colors.\\
99 - Yeah.\\
100 - Yeah.\\
101 - You know, the whole concept
of grades is so subjective.\\
102 - It's really the experience
of college that's important.\\
103 - No, it's not.\\
104 - Mail's here.\\
105 - Nothing.\\
106 - Sorry I was late.
We were at The Hub.\\
107 - Then I had to drive everyone
home, then Kelso says...\\
108 - Blah, blah. You're late.\\
109 - Be responsible for
your own actions.\\
110 - That's real easy
for you to say, pal!\\
111 - That kid's on dope.\\
112 - Don't want to
miss Sanford and Son.\\
113 - Mom?\\
114 - - Um, can I talk to
you for a second?
- Sure.\\
115 - Okay.\\
116 - A friend of mine,
and it's not me...\\
117 - - is pregnant.
- Is it you?\\
118 - - No, Mom, not me.
- Oh, thank God.\\
119 - I just had the most
horrible flashback\\
120 - to when I was 16 and...\\
121 - You were saying, honey?\\
122 - The whole pregnancy thing
is just so scary\\
123 - and overwhelming.\\
124 - Jackie, I mean...\\
125 - my friend.\\
126 - It is you, isn't it?\\
127 - No.\\
128 - She had one night of fun and
now her whole life is out of control.\\
129 - Are you worried
about you and Eric?\\
130 - No.\\
131 - Maybe.\\
132 - Yes.\\
133 - Honey, let me just
tell you what I think.\\
134 - Sometimes...\\
135 - in the heat of the moment,
things happen.\\
136 - And the backseat of a car
is no place\\
137 - to be worrying
about birth control.\\
138 - Thanks, Mom.\\
139 - Sanford thinks he's
having a heart attack.\\
140 - It looks like the big one.
Come watch.\\
141 - So, I've been
thinking about it...\\
142 - and I'm gonna do
the right thing.\\
143 - I'm gonna be responsible.
I mean, I have to.\\
144 - I'm going to be a father.\\
145 - Yeah, and on the plus side...\\
146 - you walk into a liquor store
carrying a baby, man...\\
147 - they'll sell you beer.\\
148 - Yeah... Yeah.\\
149 - And I like kids.
I still have some of my Legos.\\
150 - It's gonna be great.\\
151 - And Jackie's
mukatots will get huge.\\
152 - Fez, for those of us
who only speak English,\\
153 - what exactly is a "mukatot"?\\
154 - Feet. They will get
long as well as wide.\\
155 - Very gratifying.\\
156 - You foreign freak.\\
157 - I mean, this is scary, man.
I might have to get married.\\
158 - Not just married.
Married to Jackie.\\
159 - That's freaking terrifying.\\
160 - Okay, I am never
having sex again.\\
161 - Yeah, good one.\\
162 - No, no. I, I'm serious, man.\\
163 - It's just not worth it.
Just wait, Eric.\\
164 - This could so
easily happen to you.\\
165 - I don't think so. I'd probably
have to have sex first.\\
166 - It's just not fair.\\
167 - You're telling me.
I want to have sex.\\
168 - Gee, Laurie, I sure have
noticed you hanging around\\
169 - the mailbox a lot.\\
170 - I don't know what
you're talking about.\\
171 - What could be so important\\
172 - that you'd give up a
week of whoring around\\
173 - Fort Lauderdale?\\
174 - Oh, I know.\\
175 - It's your grades, right?
You're flunking out.\\
176 - Bingo! Forman scores! Right?\\
177 - Okay, Eric. You know what?\\
178 - Dad likes me and
he doesn't like you.\\
179 - Can I help you?\\
180 - Uh, Sure. Pictures for Forman.\\
181 - I'll be right back.\\
182 - Hey, there, Eric. You okay?\\
183 - I was just...\\
184 - How are you?\\
185 - Here you go. Can I help you?\\
186 - Uh, yup.
Prescription for Pinciotti.\\
187 - Ah, trying on cologne
for Donna, huh?\\
188 - That is so darn cute.\\
189 - - Thank you, sir.
- Mmm.\\
190 - Here you go.
That'll be $21.50.\\
191 - That's a little
pricey for cough medicine.\\
192 - Pinciotti, Donna.\\
193 - Ortho-novum.\\
194 - - Ortho what?
- Ortho-novum.\\
195 - Birth control pills.\\
196 - Midge!\\
197 - Midge?\\
198 - Meet Bob.\\
199 - He's a typical
American who works hard...\\
200 - loves his family\\
201 - and has never
cheated on his tax return.\\
202 - Life is good...\\
203 - but lately, he's noticed
some slight changes\\
204 - in his daughter, Donna.\\
205 - "Hi, honey.
How was school today?"\\
206 - "Great, Dad.\\
207 - "I got an A on a test...\\
208 - "and tonight I'm having
cocktails with the principal.\\
209 - "Will you excuse us, Dad?\\
210 - "We have to study."\\
211 - Bob realizes his
daughter is growing up.\\
212 - Now that Donna's on the pill,\\
213 - she's what medical
professionals call,\\
214 - Open for business.\\
215 - Come on, Bob.\\
216 - I want to show you something.\\
217 - You see, Bob,
the pill means Donna\\
218 - can have lots of sex\\
219 - with many different partners.\\
220 - Not just Eric.\\
221 - "Hi, Mr. Pinciotti.\\
222 - "Boy, is your
daughter something!"\\
223 - So, do you get it, Bob?\\
224 - She's open for business.\\
225 - Now, if you'll
excuse me, I'm next.\\
226 - Eric, you're not eating.
Are you sick?\\
227 - Yeah, Eric, you seem upset.\\
228 - Did something
happen at the pharmacy?\\
229 - What happened at the pharmacy?\\
230 - Nothing.\\
231 - Shut up.\\
232 - Eric, be nice to your sister.\\
233 - Kitty, what happened
to the mail?\\
234 - I checked the mail, Dad.
Nothing. No mail.\\
235 - You know, the mail
keeps disappearing.\\
236 - I think we have a little
mail thief.\\
237 - Speaking of. Laurie,
I could've sworn I saw\\
238 - a University of Wisconsin
envelope\\
239 - sticking out of your bra.
What's that all about?\\
240 - What?\\
241 - Donna's on the pill.\\
242 - What did you do?\\
243 - Nothing... Nothing.\\
244 - Dinner's over!
You. Kitchen. Now.\\
245 - I know you're 17...\\
246 - and, um...\\
247 - we can't stop you from
doing what you want to do.\\
248 - - Yes, we can.
- Red!\\
249 - All I'm saying is,
have respect for her.\\
250 - You respect her by
keeping your hands off of her.\\
251 - You are a dirty,
dirty boy, Eric.\\
252 - Okay, okay now, um,\\
253 - let's talk about birth control.\\
254 - Birth control?\\
255 - Don't do it!
That's your birth control.\\
256 - I'm gonna pray for you, Eric.\\
257 - You're the devil.\\
258 - And, uh, did you know
that Laurie's\\
259 - flunking out of college?\\
260 - Don't change the subject.\\
261 - You've got strange thoughts
in your little head, mister,\\
262 - and that Donna's a nice girl.\\
263 - Red, you are giving him
the wrong idea about sex.\\
264 - - It's not dirty.
- But it's not clean, either.\\
265 - Okay, cleanliness.\\
266 - Now, that reminds me,\\
267 - always make sure your
nails are trimmed and clean.\\
268 - Oh...\\
269 - Foreplay is very important.\\
270 - No, no, it's not.\\
271 - Yes. It is.\\
272 - Personally, I'm very proud
to have a daughter\\
273 - who acted so
mature and responsible.\\
274 - I'm her father.
You should've told me, Midge.\\
275 - Can you imagine how I felt
standing there with Eric\\
276 - when the pharmacist handed me
birth control pills?\\
277 - Eric knows? Thanks a lot, Dad!\\
278 - You know,
she and Eric are dating.\\
279 - All the more reason.\\
280 - Oh, geez!\\
281 - You'd rather she got pregnant?\\
282 - That is not gonna
happen to Donna.\\
283 - It happened to us.\\
284 - Oh, sure, throw that
in my face again.\\
285 - Hey, Laurie. Is Eric around?\\
286 - No, he's at The Hub.
Hey, watch the door.\\
287 - - What are you doing?
- My grades.\\
288 - I gotta make some Fs into Bs
before Red sees them.\\
289 - You're fine. Red and Kitty
are watching Bonanza.\\
290 - I gotta go.\\
291 - Hey. Smart move
going on the pill.\\
292 - That was the best thing
I ever did.\\
293 - Just wait till
you get to college.\\
294 - Bye.\\
295 - Donna! Donna!\\
296 - Guess what?\\
297 - - You're having twins?
- No.\\
298 - I'm not pregnant.\\
299 - Oh, My God.\\
300 - Oh, my God, Jackie, thank God.\\
301 - Oh, my God, I can forget\\
302 - about this whole ugly thing,\\
303 - put it behind me,
and never ever...\\
304 - Jackie, I am not gonna let
you forget about this...\\
305 - all right?\\
306 - You got really, really lucky.
And as your friend,\\
307 - I'm not gonna let you
be stupid about this.\\
308 - We're friends?\\
309 - Shut up.\\
310 - Jackie, I went on the pill.\\
311 - Oh, my God...\\
312 - you are gonna be so popular!\\
313 - Jackie, I didn't do it
to be popular.\\
314 - I did it because I
am not gonna get stuck\\
315 - in this dinky little town.\\
316 - Okay, well, you know
they're building a\\
317 - Kmart on Franklin.\\
318 - Jackie, when this ERA passes,\\
319 - I'm gonna be able to do
whatever I want.\\
320 - And so will you
if you don't screw it up now.\\
321 - Hmm.\\
322 - So, Donna,
tell me more about this pill.\\
323 - Does it do anything
weird to your hair?\\
324 - Mmm, only above your lip.\\
325 - I still don't understand
why Donna\\
326 - has to take this pill.\\
327 - Is she sick?\\
328 - No, Fez.
She takes the pill\\
329 - so that she can have
all the sex she wants\\
330 - and not get pregnant.\\
331 - With such a useful
product available...\\
332 - what the hell were
you thinking, you idiot?\\
333 - Forman, you know
what you should do, man?\\
334 - You should probably
break up with Donna.\\
335 - Because the pressure
of that much worry-free sex...\\
336 - that could kill you.\\
337 - Yeah, that would be
Plan B, Hyde.\\
338 - I wish Jackie would've thought
about going on the pill.\\
339 - You know, if I had the chance,
I'd do it all different.\\
340 - No, you wouldn't.\\
341 - Yeah, you're right, I wouldn't.\\
342 - I should've broken up with her
when I had the chance.\\
343 - Okay, so, uh, Eric,
can I talk to you? Alone.\\
344 - - Sure.
- Cool.\\
345 - Michael...\\
346 - I'm not pregnant.\\
347 - Yes!\\
348 - Yes! Yes!\\
349 - So, you feel tons better, right?\\
350 - Oh, yeah!\\
351 - Oh, my God, that's so great.
'Cause you know what?\\
352 - I'm breaking up with you.\\
353 - What?\\
354 - Look, Michael,
this whole experience\\
355 - has opened my eyes...\\
356 - and nothing will stand
in the way of my dream...\\
357 - of becoming a Dallas
Cowboy cheerleader.\\
358 - Did she just break up with me?\\
359 - Yup.\\
360 - I am so sad for you.\\
361 - May I please have
her phone number?\\
362 - My God, Eric. So your
parents know I'm on the pill, too?\\
363 - Yeah.\\
364 - I had a nice conversation with
Red and Kitty about foreplay.\\
365 - Sorry.\\
366 - Yeah. Me, too.\\
367 - Eric, I don't want you
to think this changes\\
368 - anything between us.\\
369 - - I don't.
- Okay.\\
370 - But it could...\\
371 - right?\\
372 - I suppose.\\
373 - I mean, who knows,
it might even be you.\\
374 - Might?\\
375 - All I'm saying is, we have
to wait for the right time.\\
376 - Okay.\\
377 - How about now?\\
378 - Mmm...\\
379 - - No.
- Okay.\\
380 - - How about now?
- No.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - - Now?
- Yes.\\
383 - - Really? Okay.
- No.\\
384 - Now, right?\\
385 - I'll be waiting.\\
386 - Shut up.\\
387 - I got a birthday coming up so...\\
388 - It's for your own good, son.\\
389 - Okay, who dealt?\\
390 - I bid, uh, three hearts.\\
391 - I'll go with three spades.\\
392 - This is fun.
\subsection {Episode 18: Career Day}
1 - Are you ready?
Yes.\\
2 - Too slow.\\
3 - Oh, I see how this game is done.\\
4 - Now my turn.\\
5 - Ready?
Yeah.\\
6 - Too slow.\\
7 - No, Fez, that's not
how the game works.\\
8 - You're supposed to hit my hands.\\
9 - Too slow.\\
10 - Who wants cookies?\\
11 - Oh, cool.\\
12 - - Thank you very much.
- They're carob. Nature's chocolate.\\
13 - I think not.
No.\\
14 - Oh, oh, come on.\\
15 - You wouldn't have known
if I hadn't told you.\\
16 - Oh, Eric, I picked out
a really snazzy outfit\\
17 - for you to wear on Career Day.\\
18 - Oh, that's, um, goody.\\
19 - Well, fine, Mr. Grumpy,\\
20 - but I can't wait to show off my
little man at work.\\
21 - You know what? Me neither.\\
22 - Help me.\\
23 - Why Career Day, man?
It's so lame.\\
24 - That's just 'cause
your mom's the lunch lady.\\
25 - Your mom is Gross Edna?\\
26 - Ew!\\
27 - I mean, cool.\\
28 - You bet it's cool.\\
29 - That's why I'm spending
the day with\\
30 - Hyde and his mom. Right?\\
31 - Eric, I need you in the garage.\\
32 - Okay. Look,
I'll be right back.\\
33 - You can explain exactly
what you did to this car.\\
34 - Okay. Look,
I'll see you tomorrow.\\
35 - Hold the light steady.\\
36 - Higher.\\
37 - Higher.\\
38 - Not in my eyes!\\
39 - Do I look like a carburetor?\\
40 - Not, um...
Not in this light.\\
41 - That's one.\\
42 - Sorry.\\
43 - Geez, Eric,
you're in high school.\\
44 - You'd think they'd take five
minutes out of teaching macrame\\
45 - and show you how to hold
a damned flashlight!\\
46 - Dad, isn't that
what college is for?\\
47 - That's two.
You wanna go for three?\\
48 - Give me that.\\
49 - Oh, see?
The damn thing is shot.\\
50 - I need a rebuild kit.\\
51 - We'll
work on this tomorrow.\\
52 - Uh, Dad, tomorrow's Career Day.\\
53 - Yeah, well,
I'm working half-days.\\
54 - I'll be home by noon.\\
55 - Um,\\
56 - I think I'm gonna go to the
hospital with mom.\\
57 - Yeah, what for?\\
58 - Well, it's Career Day, not
Career Half-Day.\\
59 - Okay, look, that's not three,
that's what my teacher said...\\
60 - Fine, Eric.
I'll, uh, fix the car and...\\
61 - and you go with your mom and\\
62 - see if you want to be a nurse.\\
63 - Hanging out\\
64 - Down the street\\
65 - The same old thing\\
66 - We did last week\\
67 - Not a thing to do\\
68 - But talk to you\\
69 - Whoa, yeah\\
70 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
71 - Okay, so, now, this is my ward.\\
72 - Um, I have to check with the
night nurse. You say hi to the girls.\\
73 - Hi, girls.\\
74 - Oh, hi. You must be Eric.\\
75 - I recognize you
from all the pictures.\\
76 - Your face has
cleared up real nice.\\
77 - Thanks for noticing that.\\
78 - You know, your mom does
the work of five nurses.\\
79 - This place would
fall apart without her.\\
80 - And she's so funny!\\
81 - Oh, yeah, she is.\\
82 - Um. wait, no, she's not.\\
83 - Oh, yeah.\\
84 - And she draws these
funny cartoons. See?\\
85 - Now, I warn you,
it's a little racy, but...\\
86 - Oh, honey,
you don't need to see that.\\
87 - It's just, um,
a certain body part\\
88 - has been shoved up
another body part\\
89 - for comic effect.\\
90 - So, um, have you met everybody?\\
91 - Nurse Forman,
I just talked to the lab.\\
92 - Why didn't you bring down
that blood sample?\\
93 - Because you
didn't give it to me?\\
94 - I most certainly did.\\
95 - Well, next time I have
something to give you,\\
96 - you tell me.\\
97 - Will do.\\
98 - What is his problem?\\
99 - Well, you all know my theory.\\
100 - Edna.\\
101 - Steven.\\
102 - Fez, this is, uh,
this is my mom.\\
103 - Nice to meet you, Mrs.
Gross Edna.\\
104 - No, no, no, honey.
It's Miss Gross Edna.\\
105 - You see, Mr. Gross Edna\\
106 - ran off with Miss Perfect Ass.\\
107 - But she can laugh about it now.\\
108 - Yes, she can.
Shut up.\\
109 - Well, I am so excited to be in
the food service industry.\\
110 - May I cut the cheese?\\
111 - Is he kidding?\\
112 - We can never tell.\\
113 - Well, knock yourself out.\\
114 - But if you cut off a finger,
you're out of here.\\
115 - Steven, you can start
by slicing pizza.\\
116 - Oh, no, no, no.
I'm here as an observer.\\
117 - A fly on the wall.
One of many.\\
118 - Gee, what a surprise.
Lazy, just like your father.\\
119 - No, actually, I'm lazy in a
way that's entirely my own.\\
120 - You two are hilarious.\\
121 - Here, put these on.\\
122 - I'm not wearing these.\\
123 - Well, sorry, don't blame me.
It's the stupid...\\
124 - Those health codes.\\
125 - May I keep these?\\
126 - Sure, baby.\\
127 - This is so cool.
My dad's office.\\
128 - Dad's desk.\\
129 - Dad's phone, ding-ding.\\
130 - My dad.
Oh...\\
131 - Yeah, I love this.\\
132 - Yeah, Michael, this is where
all the magic happens.\\
133 - Okay, let's get started.\\
134 - Question number one.
"What's your job?"\\
135 - I'm a senior executive,\\
136 - statistical analysis technician.\\
137 - You're a senior execu-what?\\
138 - Well, in plain English\\
139 - I concatenate diverse
statistical information\\
140 - to maximize the potential
utilization of data.\\
141 - So...\\
142 - you give people data?\\
143 - You know, a lot of
people think that. No.\\
144 - My job's not about output,
it's about throughput.\\
145 - So you throughput data?\\
146 - Well, now you've lost me, son.\\
147 - Oh, listen, Michael...\\
148 - you know the eight-tracks
you love so much?\\
149 - - You make them?
- No.\\
150 - But because of us,
other people who make them\\
151 - are able to make them better.\\
152 - So you fix stuff?\\
153 - You could say that.\\
154 - But I wouldn't.\\
155 - You picked a good
day to do this, Donna.\\
156 - We're starting
a three-day promotional sale.\\
157 - You'll finally get to see
why they call me Bargain Bob.\\
158 - Yeah, Dad, 'cause that's been
a real stumper.\\
159 - Ooh, you're such a cutie.\\
160 - Well, you keep your eyes peeled\\
161 - and your pencil sharp\\
162 - because you're gonna learn how a\\
163 - serious businessman operates.\\
164 - Oh, good, the clowns are here.\\
165 - Oh, hello, Mr. Forman,
what are you doing home?\\
166 - That's right, you're
only working part-time.\\
167 - If it makes you feel any better,\\
168 - my dad feels really,
really sorry for you.\\
169 - Aren't you supposed
to be at Career Day?\\
170 - No, I'm a sophomore.\\
171 - I'm surprised
you didn't know that about me.\\
172 - Right. My mistake.\\
173 - Listen, while you're here,\\
174 - why don't you hold
this flashlight\\
175 - on that, uh, carburetor there.\\
176 - Like this?\\
177 - My God.
One of you is not useless.\\
178 - A world of careers
is waiting for you.\\
179 - Talk to your
guidance counselor today.\\
180 - These people are ready
for the jobs of tomorrow.\\
181 - Are you?\\
182 - Good morning! This is my son.
He's making my rounds with me.\\
183 - Now, you let me know if this
gets to be too much for you.\\
184 - Okay, Mom, I think
that I can handle it...\\
185 - Oh, good God! What is that?\\
186 - Remember this the next time
you want a skateboard.\\
187 - I have some bad news.\\
188 - Oh. I have some good news.\\
189 - Okay, now push!\\
190 - Ow, ma'am,
you're hurting me.\\
191 - You don't know
what pain is!\\
192 - Okay.\\
193 - All right.\\
194 - This is the performance index
before my involvement.\\
195 - And this...\\
196 - is after.\\
197 - Okay, okay. So,
you're responsible for this.\\
198 - Mmm, you can't
credit me with that.\\
199 - That's probably
a statistical anomaly.\\
200 - But you made the chart, right?\\
201 - Oh! I wish.\\
202 - So do I.\\
203 - Okay, question number three.\\
204 - "Was the food service industry
your first career choice?"\\
205 - Heck, no, Fez.\\
206 - I always wanted to
go into show biz.\\
207 - In fact,\\
208 - I was in the Tommy Bartlett
water show\\
209 - at the Wisconsin Dells.\\
210 - Yes, women
waterskiing in bikinis.\\
211 - Very erotic.\\
212 - Anyway...\\
213 - I was the top girl
on the pyramid,\\
214 - when they fired me
for getting knocked up.\\
215 - Let me finish this
one for you, Edna.\\
216 - Fez, this is the story where
I ruin my mother's\\
217 - fabulous water skiing career.\\
218 - Oh.
Yeah, you did.\\
219 - They said a pregnant girl
on water skis\\
220 - would make the audience nervous.\\
221 - Not to mention, you were
probably hideously fat.\\
222 - Uh-uh. No, no, no.\\
223 - I looked great. I kept my
weight down by smoking.\\
224 - See, that's that maternal
instinct kicking in again.\\
225 - Yeah, you're damn
right I'm maternal.\\
226 - I raised you alone.\\
227 - Alone? Hardly.\\
228 - There was "uncle" Chet,
and "uncle" Larry,\\
229 - and, oh, yeah,
"uncle" hot tub Johnny.\\
230 - I suppose I should've
just become a nun\\
231 - when your father
walked out on me.\\
232 - Hell, he must've been crazy
to leave all this.\\
233 - Always a smart ass, Steven.
Just like your father.\\
234 - You know what? One
thing he did do right: He left!\\
235 - All right. That's right,
Steven, just walk.\\
236 - Just like everyone else.\\
237 - Okay, question number four.\\
238 - "Would you say you
are a people person?"\\
239 - Come on, Jackie! Harder!
Come on, give it all you got.\\
240 - Yeah!
My God, I did it!\\
241 - I did it! I'm changing a tire!\\
242 - I feel like Nancy Drew.\\
243 - Well, a girl needs to know
what to do in an emergency.\\
244 - You know, I'm surprised your
father hasn't taught you this already.\\
245 - Yeah, well...\\
246 - Daddy works really hard, so he
doesn't spend a lot of time with me.\\
247 - But he did promise me
a Mustang for my birthday.\\
248 - So I love him.\\
249 - You know, Jackie,\\
250 - I've been a father
a long time...\\
251 - so trust me when
I tell you this.\\
252 - The Mustang's front end is
problematic. Get yourself a Firebird.\\
253 - All right,
let's start Mr. Harris\\
254 - on a full course of penicillin.\\
255 - Oh, um, doctor, you might
want to consider erythromycin.\\
256 - And why would I
want to do that, nurse?\\
257 - Well, it's just that, um,\\
258 - Mr. Harris is
allergic to penicillin and...\\
259 - I thought erythromycin might
make him a touch less dead.\\
260 - I know that when I go to
the hospital, I like to not die.\\
261 - Okay...\\
262 - do you have customers?\\
263 - No, they're more like clients.\\
264 - But you have clients?
Sort of.\\
265 - And you provide them a product?\\
266 - It's more like a service.\\
267 - A service?
Well, not...\\
268 - To maximize the potential
utilization of the data?\\
269 - If we did that,
we'd go out of business.\\
270 - Hey, Red. Forman around?\\
271 - No, he's with his
mom for Career Day.\\
272 - Which is where you're
supposed to be. What's the deal?\\
273 - Man.\\
274 - Edna's riding me again
about being just like my dad.\\
275 - So I just took off.\\
276 - Didn't your dad, uh, take off?\\
277 - Mmm. Irony. Far out.\\
278 - Look, you and your mom
have a bad history.\\
279 - And neither of you can...\\
280 - nurture the other's
self esteem...\\
281 - because you've both been damaged\\
282 - by past criticism and shame.\\
283 - Are you okay?\\
284 - I'm working half-days,
so I watch a lot of Donahue.\\
285 - Okay...\\
286 - I'm not sure, but I think
I found the u-joint.\\
287 - God bless you, Jackie.\\
288 - Okay, I'm going back in.\\
289 - Could someone help me get
Mr. Anderson\\
290 - on the gurney, please?\\
291 - - Oh, I'll give you
a hand, Mom.
- Okay.\\
292 - So, what's wrong with him?\\
293 - He's dead.
Oh, my...\\
294 - What?\\
295 - Didn't we just see this guy
a half an hour ago?\\
296 - Oh, um...\\
297 - Honey, he was dead then.\\
298 - I just... I didn't have
the heart to tell you.\\
299 - I'm so sorry you didn't
get a chance to meet him.\\
300 - Wait, Mr. Anderson?\\
301 - Isn't this the guy you
always talked about at dinner?\\
302 - The guy whose
daughter just got married?\\
303 - Yeah, yeah, he just
showed me the pictures.\\
304 - It was a beautiful wedding.\\
305 - I'm gonna miss him.\\
306 - So, okay, you grab that end,
and let's get moving.\\
307 - We have to serve
dinner in 20 minutes.\\
308 - And then we look at
the chi square here...\\
309 - apply the standard
deviation here...\\
310 - and correlate the results\\
311 - with the actualization
median here.\\
312 - And that's what I do.\\
313 - And I can't make it
any clearer than that.\\
314 - I'm just gonna
say you're a farmer.\\
315 - Okay, next question.\\
316 - "What has this
job taught you?"\\
317 - One thing I've learned.
Midgets make money.\\
318 - I don't know why, but people see a
midget, they wanna buy a blender.\\
319 - I guess it reminds
them that life is short.\\
320 - Write, write, write,
write, write.\\
321 - Marketing is important.
Know your customer.\\
322 - Hey. That's not what I said.\\
323 - None of this is what I said.\\
324 - Well, sure it is, Dad.\\
325 - I mean, I just cleaned up
the language a bit\\
326 - to make you
sound more dignified.\\
327 - Dignified?\\
328 - What are you saying?
You're embarrassed by me?\\
329 - What have I ever done
that's embarrassing?\\
330 - Just look around.\\
331 - All right.
Let me tell you what I see.\\
332 - You see clowns, I see
your tuition at Harvard.\\
333 - You see your dad
as a ringmaster,\\
334 - I see you going to grad school.\\
335 - You see a
chimpanzee in a tutu...\\
336 - Okay, that just makes me laugh.\\
337 - The chimp is cute.\\
338 - The point is, Donna,\\
339 - you're capable of great things.\\
340 - And if this is what I have to do\\
341 - so you can achieve them...\\
342 - then that's what I'll do.\\
343 - Oh, geez, Dad.\\
344 - I feel really bad.\\
345 - Hey, hey. Nobody feels
really bad around Bargain Bob!\\
346 - Unless you got bit by a
monkey.\\
347 - Bad, bad, blood, blood\\
348 - Is taking you for a ride\\
349 - The only good thing\\
350 - About bad blood\\
351 - Is letting it slide\\
352 - Mom, how do you
do this every day?\\
353 - You're always running around and\\
354 - people are sick and dying...\\
355 - I mean, poor Mr. Anderson.\\
356 - Look, you knew this guy, Mom.
How do you deal with all this?\\
357 - Here we go now.\\
358 - -Bad
-Bad\\
359 - -Blood
-Blood\\
360 - The bitch is in her smile\\
361 - The lie is on her lips\\
362 - Such an evil child\\
363 - Whoa! What are you doing?\\
364 - Throwing out
the disgusting used meat.\\
365 - No, no, no sweetie, you've
gotta toss that in the chili bucket.\\
366 - The chili bucket?\\
367 - - I thought that
was the garbage.
- Oh, no.\\
368 - - Have you thrown
a lot in there?
- Some.\\
369 - Well, most things just\\
370 - break down in there.
It'll be fine.\\
371 - Hi.\\
372 - Steven, you came back.\\
373 - You don't know
what that means to me.\\
374 - Oh, yeah?\\
375 - Yeah.\\
376 - Honey, could you clean up
those pizza trays?\\
377 - I'm gonna skip out early.\\
378 - Mmm. Guess what I did
in the chili bucket?\\
379 - Go ahead, guess.\\
380 - Uh, Steven, I'm sorry.\\
381 - I'm not being
a very good mom, am I?\\
382 - No.\\
383 - All right,
I've got a better idea.\\
384 - Let's do something together.\\
385 - Come on, I'll buy you a beer.\\
386 - A beer?\\
387 - - Well, yeah,
that actually sounds good.
- You got your fake ID?\\
388 - You know it.
That's my boy.\\
389 - Baby, baby, baby,
baby, baby, whoa.\\
390 - "Autumn is harvest
time for the farmer.\\
391 - "At dawn, my dad and I
were out in the field\\
392 - "picking carrots
fresh off the trees."\\
393 - Kelso, carrots don't...\\
394 - That's good.
You should put that down.\\
395 - So, what do you guys
want to do when you graduate?\\
396 - Oh, um...
Not touch dead people, ever.\\
397 - I want to go back
to my homeland...\\
398 - with all that knowledge
I have learned in Wisconsin...\\
399 - and rule with an iron fist.\\
400 - Hey, Dad.\\
401 - Hey, um... Jackie.\\
402 - Eric. How was Career Day?\\
403 - Oh, it was good.
I learned a lot.\\
404 - Good. Now you're going
to learn something else.\\
405 - Jackie's gonna teach you
how to hold a flashlight.\\
406 - Jackie?\\
407 - Yeah, I finally found
one of your friends I like.\\
408 - Okay, Jackie isn't really
one of my friends.\\
409 - That's one.\\
410 - That's how you do that.
\subsection {Episode 19: Prom Night}
1 - My first prom tux, huh?\\
2 - Come on, guys,
dig the crushed velvet.\\
3 - Eric, you look like a pimp.\\
4 - You know, Forman...\\
5 - prom night could be
a very special\\
6 - night for you and Donna.\\
7 - Hyde, this could be the
biggest night of our lives.\\
8 - I mean, Donna and I could go...\\
9 - To the prom.\\
10 - No, Fez. All the way.\\
11 - All the way to the prom.\\
12 - You know what you should do?
You should rent a motel room.\\
13 - Oh, yeah, that's spontaneous.\\
14 - What?\\
15 - Look, if this night
is as big as I think,\\
16 - I want it to be very,
very special.\\
17 - Because this is gonna be
the first time for both of us.\\
18 - Oh, You silly virgins.\\
19 - Anyway,
this is how I picture it.\\
20 - Well, here we are...\\
21 - walking on the beach.\\
22 - And now we're gonna do it.\\
23 - Yes, yes.
Isn't it spontaneous?\\
24 - Exactly. That's what got me.\\
25 - Ah, that was nice.\\
26 - But if I plan it out, it
won't be nice. It'll be...\\
27 - Good evening.
Did you bring the forms?\\
28 - Yes, I did. Here's
the guarantee of foreplay.\\
29 - Signed, initialed, notarized.\\
30 - Very well. As you know,
I'm on the pill...\\
31 - so here is your copy
of the prophylactic waiver.\\
32 - It looks like
we have a deal here.\\
33 - - I'm looking forward
to consummation.
- Excellent.\\
34 - Thank you.\\
35 - Forman,
if you don't get a motel,\\
36 - it's gonna be more like this.\\
37 - You're home already?\\
38 - It's not even 10:00.\\
39 - You didn't have a plan, did you?\\
40 - Kitty, he's home already.\\
41 - Already? Eric,
you're just such a loser.\\
42 - He is, isn't he?\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - Whoa, yeah\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - Are you ready
to rock and roll?\\
52 - Kitty, I am so mad at Bob.\\
53 - I'm trying to improve myself,
and he won't let me.\\
54 - Plus, he says
my ideas are stupid.\\
55 - Oh, well, now that's\\
56 - the pot calling
the kettle black, isn't it?\\
57 - I'll say.\\
58 - Wha... What?\\
59 - Good coffee.\\
60 - You know, I'm sorry, Midge.\\
61 - But, um, I really
have to get to work.\\
62 - Gosh, darn it, I want a job.\\
63 - Well, you know, Midge, having a
job is not all it's cracked up to be.\\
64 - Working at the hospital
is very hard work.\\
65 - But I don't want one of
those jobs. I want a fun job.\\
66 - Okay, well,\\
67 - even with a fun job...\\
68 - you still... you have to deal
with your boss.\\
69 - You're right.
I'll get a job as a boss.\\
70 - Well, now...\\
71 - ...that is a
sharp plan, Midge.\\
72 - You just... You let
me know how that goes.\\
73 - Okay.\\
74 - Okay, guys.\\
75 - Guess who's taking
Pam Macy to the prom?\\
76 - Anyone with a quarter?\\
77 - Me.\\
78 - Damn, and I had a quarter.\\
79 - Hey, Kelso, you're not
taking Jackie?\\
80 - No way, man.
Jackie dumped me.\\
81 - Hey, I can take Jackie.\\
82 - Yeah, do it, Fez,
and I'll kick your ass.\\
83 - Well, well, well.
Look who suddenly cares.\\
84 - Ow. Why did you hit me?
That was sarcasm.\\
85 - You know, you guys are making
me sick with all your prom talk.\\
86 - Proms are stupid.\\
87 - Hyde, what would you know?
You've never even been to one.\\
88 - Well, I haven't been
to the dentist, either,\\
89 - but I don't need to
go to know it's lame.\\
90 - Oh!\\
91 - I know who I can
ask to the prom.\\
92 - Oh, boy, who, Fez?\\
93 - The lucky lady is...\\
94 - my English teacher.\\
95 - Fez, you can't take
a teacher to the prom.\\
96 - Why not? She's always writing
sexy comments on my homework.\\
97 - See.\\
98 - "Nice job. Good effort.\\
99 - "See me.\\
100 - "I love you."\\
101 - Okay, I made
the last one up.\\
102 - But the other ones were real.\\
103 - These are the shoes
I'm wearing to the prom.\\
104 - Aren't they cool?\\
105 - Oh, my God, I was
gonna get new shoes...\\
106 - except Michael didn't ask me.\\
107 - And you like my
prom dress, right?\\
108 - Oh, my God. I was gonna
get a new prom dress...\\
109 - except Michael didn't ask me.\\
110 - I'm so nervous about the prom.\\
111 - I think it's gonna be
the night that Eric and I...\\
112 - You know?\\
113 - Oh, my gosh, that's when
Michael and I\\
114 - were going to do it
for the first time.\\
115 - Jackie, you and Kelso did it,
like, two months ago.\\
116 - And, like, 30 times after that.\\
117 - Yeah, but it would have been
our first time at a prom.\\
118 - Except Michael didn't ask me.\\
119 - Jackie, you broke up with him.\\
120 - I know. Isn't it sad?\\
121 - Look, just ask
Kelso to go with you.\\
122 - God, no. This is the prom.\\
123 - This is no time
for your stupid feminist crap.\\
124 - Hello, Michael.\\
125 - Hello, Jackie.\\
126 - I'm just over here helping
Donna get ready for the prom.\\
127 - Because Eric and Donna
are going to the prom.\\
128 - Yes, we are.\\
129 - I'm going to the prom.\\
130 - I'm taking Pam Macy.\\
131 - Oh, the...
...thing.\\
132 - Oh.\\
133 - Well, I have a date, too.\\
134 - Who is it? What's his name?\\
135 - His name is not important.\\
136 - What's important is,
he's better than you...\\
137 - in every conceivable way.\\
138 - Damn, Jackie,
that could be anybody!\\
139 - Jackie...\\
140 - if I asked you what's wrong,
will you stop doing that?\\
141 - It's the prom.\\
142 - Stupid Michael's
taking stupid Pam Macy.\\
143 - And I don't have a date, but I told
him I did, and I'm a complete loser.\\
144 - No, you're not.\\
145 - It's just that, like, I thought
he was gonna ask me...\\
146 - and now everyone who's anyone
is already going.\\
147 - Ugh. That is so true.\\
148 - How would you know?
You're not even going.\\
149 - You're not even going.\\
150 - Oh, oh! And I bet
you clean up real good.\\
151 - Well, I do, but I won't.\\
152 - See, that's a big
part of who I am.\\
153 - Look, I know we've had
our differences, but...\\
154 - Jackie, we've had
nothing but differences.\\
155 - In fact, don't we
kind of hate each other?\\
156 - Yes, but this is the prom.\\
157 - Jackie, stop.\\
158 - Stop crying. Stop it.\\
159 - Look, do you want
to go to the prom?\\
160 - Yes.\\
161 - Wow. The gym looks like...\\
162 - Well, the gym with streamers.
But it's, it's nice.\\
163 - Yeah. You know, this is just
gonna be an incredible night.\\
164 - Really incredible.\\
165 - Wait. What do you mean?\\
166 - What do you mean?\\
167 - Nothing.\\
168 - Okay, then me neither.\\
169 - Hey, guys.
Pam, this is Eric and Donna.\\
170 - We have biology class together.\\
171 - Biology?\\
172 - Yeah.\\
173 - See, Pam doesn't like
to talk about school.\\
174 - Are you guys having fun?\\
175 - No.\\
176 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
177 - My God, Kelso, you'd rather
be with her than Jackie?\\
178 - Hey, I love her!\\
179 - No, you don't.\\
180 - Okay, I don't.\\
181 - See, but Jackie's
gonna be really jealous.\\
182 - Good evening, kids.
So, is everyone having fun?\\
183 - Why, yes, we are,
Ms. Kaminsky.\\
184 - There you are, Diane. I've
been looking all over for you.\\
185 - Shall we dance?\\
186 - I am not going to
dance with you, Fez.\\
187 - Isn't she adorable?\\
188 - They're all
gonna laugh at you!\\
189 - Shut up, Ma,
you're making\\
190 - the night too damn special.\\
191 - Hey.\\
192 - Wow, you look beautiful.\\
193 - Oh, my God. So do you.\\
194 - Um...\\
195 - Do you want me to go inside
and meet your...\\
196 - No, no, no.
Trust me, she's lovely.\\
197 - Let's just go, all right?\\
198 - Is that for me?\\
199 - Oh, yeah.
Here, I got this for you.\\
200 - Oh, God, Steven,
this is beautiful.\\
201 - You know, this whole
experience has taught me\\
202 - that I don't need Michael
to go to the prom.\\
203 - I can go with anyone.\\
204 - Even you.\\
205 - Thanks.\\
206 - Okay, let's not do that.\\
207 - Sorry. Um...\\
208 - I have my dad's Lincoln.
Will you drive?\\
209 - Yeah.\\
210 - He's got insurance, right?\\
211 - Wait, I don't care. Let's go.\\
212 - I've decided what kind
of business\\
213 - I'm going to open.\\
214 - What's the one thing
people can't live without?\\
215 - Oxygen.\\
216 - No.\\
217 - No, no, no. That's true.\\
218 - But that's not what I'm
selling. So keep guessing.\\
219 - Lemonade?\\
220 - Mmm-mmm.\\
221 - Give up?\\
222 - I'm about to.\\
223 - Greeting cards.\\
224 - Good wine.\\
225 - This is such a great night.\\
226 - Yeah.\\
227 - It's too bad our
parents aren't out of town.\\
228 - So we'd have someplace to go.\\
229 - For after.\\
230 - Yeah. Like, a motel room?\\
231 - Yeah. That would've
been great.\\
232 - Really? 'Cause I got one.\\
233 - Did you plan on telling me?\\
234 - No.\\
235 - Well, it's better
that you didn't.\\
236 - 'Cause then it wouldn't
have been spontaneous.\\
237 - Sponta...\\
238 - Oh, you are so the girl for me.\\
239 - Let's go.\\
240 - Okay.\\
241 - Why so glum, Fez?\\
242 - Well, Mrs. Clark, you may be
good at teaching the music...\\
243 - but you cannot help
me in the ways of love.\\
244 - Aw, Fez, has someone
got you down?\\
245 - So far down, Mrs. Clark.\\
246 - Here's a little ditty I've been
working on. Maybe it'll help.\\
247 - Hit it.\\
248 - Midge, you don't know the first
thing about having a business.\\
249 - But there's no risk, Bob.\\
250 - Why not?\\
251 - Because it's your money!\\
252 - Kitty...\\
253 - don't you think I should have
my own card shop?\\
254 - Midgie, hold on.\\
255 - - I think I have
a dynamite solution.
- Really?\\
256 - Oh, yeah. 'Cause I love you.\\
257 - So, I want you to have another
baby and stop bugging me.\\
258 - Oh, Bob. No.\\
259 - So, how much this whole setup
gonna cost you, Bob?\\
260 - Plenty.\\
261 - But I figure it'll be cheaper
than a divorce.\\
262 - We'll see.\\
263 - And, uh, here we are.\\
264 - This is so romantic.\\
265 - Hey, it's Forman and Donna.
And they're gonna do it!\\
266 - Forman!
Forman!\\
267 - Yeah.\\
268 - You know what?
Those guys are just jerks.\\
269 - Hey, I forgot
about them already.\\
270 - Hang on, hang on.
Big stain, big stain.\\
271 - - I'm just gonna
go grab a towel.
- Okay.\\
272 - Oh, good God!\\
273 - You know, they say they're
more scared of you\\
274 - than you are of them.
Right, so?\\
275 - You know, Donna, I've thought
about this moment, like...\\
276 - a thousand times.\\
277 - Me, too.\\
278 - One, two, three.\\
279 - All right.\\
280 - Hey, when you thought about
this moment, was it like this?\\
281 - Not really.\\
282 - You know, I was having
a pretty good time at prom.\\
283 - Me, too.\\
284 - Let's get out of here.\\
285 - Okay.\\
286 - Um...\\
287 - Donna, what if this
is our only chance?\\
288 - It won't be.\\
289 - Okay.\\
290 - It's just that I always pictured\\
291 - Michael and I
together at the prom.\\
292 - That's the way it was
supposed to be, you know?\\
293 - Yeah, I know.\\
294 - Tsk. Well...\\
295 - Hey, Pam's butt looks
really big in that dress.\\
296 - No, it doesn't.\\
297 - Yeah, no, it doesn't.\\
298 - But thank you.\\
299 - Um...\\
300 - Do you mind if we just sit down?\\
301 - Yeah, okay.
I'll go grab some punch.\\
302 - Hyde, you brought
Jackie to the prom?\\
303 - You're supposed to be my
friend and you dogged me.\\
304 - Hey. She cried, man.\\
305 - Well, is she having a good time?\\
306 - 'Cause she looks real pretty.\\
307 - All right, look, you big baby.\\
308 - She wants to be with you,
and you want to be with her.\\
309 - So, why don't you
stop whining about it\\
310 - and just go be with each other.\\
311 - 'Cause the whole
thing sickens me.\\
312 - But what am I gonna do with Pam?\\
313 - Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of Pam.\\
314 - Excuse me, Pam.\\
315 - Hi.\\
316 - Have you ever seen the
backseat of a Lincoln Continental?\\
317 - Lots of times.\\
318 - Would you like to
see another one?\\
319 - Sure.\\
320 - That's great. Let's go.\\
321 - Jackie.\\
322 - Michael.\\
323 - You look beautiful.\\
324 - You look really handsome.\\
325 - I miss you.\\
326 - I miss you, too.\\
327 - Eric, please may I have
your motel room key, please?\\
328 - Fez, I'm not going
to a motel with you.\\
329 - Yes, and you also said
you would not dance with me.
\subsection {Episode 20: A New Hope}
1 - I am so excited about
Star Whores.\\
2 - Fezzie, man, it's Star Wars.\\
3 - Screw that.\\
4 - Hey, Forman, man,
this thing better be good.\\
5 - If I don't see some space jugs,\\
6 - I'm gonna be super-pissed.\\
7 - I don't know, guys.
I hear it's okay.\\
8 - Well, there's no way it's better
than The Planet of the Apes.\\
9 - I mean, those apes
were really good actors.\\
10 - Whoa!\\
11 - And then they go into this bar\\
12 - and there are all these
space creatures,\\
13 - and then, someone
makes the mistake\\
14 - of picking on Obi-Wan Kenobi.\\
15 - And then, he takes out his
lightsaber and he goes "Whoosh"\\
16 - and he chops
this guy's arm right off,\\
17 - 'cause it's a saber
that's made out of light.\\
18 - Well, you know, this doesn't
sound like a nice movie.\\
19 - Now, The Way We Were,
that's a nice movie.\\
20 - So, Eric, you gonna get yourself\\
21 - some Star Wars pajamas now?\\
22 - Kitty, I'm going
back to work, full-time.\\
23 - My God, you're kidding.\\
24 - No, I ran into Ron
Milbank at the K-Mart,\\
25 - and he's moved back
to re-open the plant.\\
26 - Oh...
Oh, this is a godsend.\\
27 - Oh, and to think how close
we came to losing the house.\\
28 - Losing the... Mom,
you said we were fine.\\
29 - Oh, Eric, honey, I lied.\\
30 - Oh, honey,
this is the best news.\\
31 - Well, I'm... I'm so glad
that you're happy.\\
32 - Hey, way to go, Daddy.\\
33 - Ah, my job and my little girl.\\
34 - Okay, so, I'm here, too, Dad.\\
35 - Oh, uh, speaking of you...\\
36 - I told Milbank's son, David,
to come by to see you.\\
37 - David Milbank?
Dad, I hated that guy.\\
38 - Yeah, well, I hate his dad\\
39 - but I smile like
hell whenever I see him.\\
40 - And you'll do the same.
Got it?\\
41 - Got it.\\
42 - David Milbank? Oh, barf.\\
43 - Eric, remember when you
beat him up on the playground?\\
44 - Yep. I kicked his ass.\\
45 - Wait, wasn't he the kid
with scoliosis and asthma?\\
46 - Yep.\\
47 - And I kicked his ass.\\
48 - So, Jackie, you want to
go see Star Wars tonight?\\
49 - Michael, I told you,
I don't like space.\\
50 - Jackie, if we're gonna start
our relationship over,\\
51 - you gotta meet
me halfway, honey.\\
52 - Well, maybe I want
to do something else tonight.\\
53 - Like what?\\
54 - God, Jackie.\\
55 - We can do that for
the rest of our lives!\\
56 - Star Wars is
a limited engagement.\\
57 - Fine. Fine,
but I want the big popcorn.\\
58 - Ah, they finally left.\\
59 - Now it's just the three of us.\\
60 - That's great, Fez.\\
61 - Oh, I get it.\\
62 - If I was gone,
you two would kiss.\\
63 - Ah, life's a bitch, huh?\\
64 - Eric! David's here.\\
65 - The scoliosis,
asthma freak is here?\\
66 - I cannot wait to see this.\\
67 - Hey, guys. I'm back.\\
68 - Yeah, hey.\\
69 - Wow, David.
You've really grown up.\\
70 - Me? Look at you.\\
71 - You have really grown up.\\
72 - Yes, in fact,
we've all grown up.\\
73 - Yes, but him much
more than you have.\\
74 - So, David, hey!
Tell us about you.\\
75 - We're dating.\\
76 - What was that?\\
77 - What? I'm just...\\
78 - Sorry, I'm
making conversation here.\\
79 - So, uh, Donna, you still
writing short stories?\\
80 - Well, yeah,
I still write a little.\\
81 - Well, not every...
You still write?\\
82 - I mean, I would
love to read your stuff.\\
83 - Yeah?\\
84 - Well, enough about us.
Tell us about you.\\
85 - David, you still got that
big old curve in your spine?\\
86 - Can I see it?\\
87 - Hey, Kelso.\\
88 - Laurie.\\
89 - I'm bored.\\
90 - If you're bored,
you should go see Star Wars.\\
91 - No, I was thinking of doing
something else and...\\
92 - Laurie, what's going on?\\
93 - You're acting like you're
liking me and that's weird.\\
94 - It's like I told you, Kelso.
I'm bored.\\
95 - Well, that's very flattering.\\
96 - But, uh, you know, Jackie
and I are back together.\\
97 - Oh, I understand.\\
98 - Do you want to see
my appendix scar?\\
99 - Once again...\\
100 - what's-her-name and
I are back together.\\
101 - Well, It's not my best story
but it's...\\
102 - Wow!\\
103 - I love it.
Do you have any more?\\
104 - Yeah, oh, my God, yeah,\\
105 - I totally have more.
I just...\\
106 - Oh!
Oh, my God!\\
107 - Oh, my God, I am so sorry.\\
108 - - I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.\\
109 - Oh, I'm so
sorry about that.\\
110 - Hey, what the hell's
going on here?\\
111 - I spilled soda on him.\\
112 - Oh.\\
113 - I should leave.\\
114 - I'll see you later.
Okay.\\
115 - Hey, Donna, great writing.\\
116 - What is it with you?\\
117 - Me? Donna,
he's hitting on you.\\
118 - He is not. We're just friends.\\
119 - He talks to me, listens to me,
shares ideas with me.\\
120 - Oh, my God, Donna,
you are so naive.\\
121 - Eric, just because a guy
pays attention to me,\\
122 - does not mean he
wants to get me naked.\\
123 - Oh... Grow up!\\
124 - Was that why you
paid attention to me?\\
125 - Of course!\\
126 - Not. Of course not.\\
127 - I love your mind.\\
128 - That's the thing I love.\\
129 - So, Donna says David and her
are just good friends...\\
130 - and if I don't believe that...\\
131 - um, then she's gonna think
that I don't trust her.\\
132 - Eric, maybe you should
let David have Donna.\\
133 - I mean, they look
so nice together.\\
134 - You see, this is why
your country lost the war.\\
135 - My country never fought a war.\\
136 - Yeah, big surprise.\\
137 - You know,
Forman, I'm a romantic.\\
138 - So I say you choke him
till his eyes pop out.\\
139 - Yeah. Hitting people is cool.\\
140 - I don't know.\\
141 - If I hit this guy,
Donna's just gonna be pissed.\\
142 - No, man.
Chicks dig that stuff.\\
143 - I mean, Leia, right, she acted
like she was mad at Han...\\
144 - but I could tell she liked him.\\
145 - Kelso, man,
what are you, an idiot?\\
146 - Leia likes Luke. I mean,
she kissed him on that bridge.\\
147 - Uh, just for luck!\\
148 - Guys, I have
a real problem here.\\
149 - Oh, I got it.\\
150 - Maybe you should let
David have Donna\\
151 - because, I mean,
they look so nice together.\\
152 - Now remember,
a Jedi is his own master.\\
153 - His own master.
His own master.\\
154 - A Jedi's power
lies within his own...\\
155 - Are you even listening to me?\\
156 - What? Yes. Um,
you were saying,\\
157 - "May the force be with me."\\
158 - No, I did not.\\
159 - Jedi Knight.\\
160 - Jedi dumbass.\\
161 - Luke, man...\\
162 - I don't mean to bum you out...\\
163 - but I just saw Princess Leia
cruise around\\
164 - with Darth Vader
in his tie-fighter.\\
165 - Right, Chewie?\\
166 - Man, this totally sucks!
I should be Han.\\
167 - Hey, quit whining.\\
168 - Will somebody get that?\\
169 - You know what? Why
don't I just get it myself?\\
170 - Honey, it's Darth Vader.\\
171 - Thanks, Mom.\\
172 - Oh, my God...\\
173 - you guys just gotta
come over to the dark side.\\
174 - They have free food.\\
175 - All right, what have you done
with Princess Leia?\\
176 - Hey, guys.\\
177 - Leia, what are you
doing with Darth Vader?\\
178 - Oh, we're, um...
just friends, Luke.\\
179 - He's nice.
I think you'd really like him.\\
180 - No, I wouldn't!\\
181 - Give me a chance, Luke.\\
182 - Look.\\
183 - Hello? He's choking
me with his mind, here.\\
184 - That's, like, yeah, evil.\\
185 - While Michael and I were apart,\\
186 - he realized how much
he missed me.\\
187 - I'm telling you, Donna,\\
188 - breaking up with him
was the best thing I ever did.\\
189 - I thought you said that
getting a pedicure\\
190 - was the best thing you ever did.\\
191 - That was last week, Donna.\\
192 - I don't know, I don't know!\\
193 - I don't know
what to do about Eric.\\
194 - He's acting like
this possessive, macho jerk.\\
195 - Oh, I am so happy
for you, Donna!\\
196 - No, Jackie, I'm with him
because I thought\\
197 - he wasn't like that.\\
198 - Mrs. Pinciotti,
can you tell Donna I'm right?\\
199 - Isn't it cool when men
act like they own you?\\
200 - Oh, yeah.\\
201 - Mom, what about all those
feminist classes you took?\\
202 - Oh, right. No.\\
203 - Hey, Mr. Pinciotti. Hey, Dad.\\
204 - Hey, there, Eric.\\
205 - Hey, Dad, um...\\
206 - I was wondering if you could
show me, like,\\
207 - a few fighting moves.\\
208 - - Who are you
planning to fight?
- David Milbank.\\
209 - David Milbank?
He's got scoliosis and asthma.\\
210 - You could take him.\\
211 - Come on, now, Eric.\\
212 - Why don't you, uh,
beat up Kelso?\\
213 - I don't work for his dad.\\
214 - He's making a move on Donna.\\
215 - Oh. No, no, no.\\
216 - Donna's not going
near that pretzel boy.\\
217 - No, no. You've got to nip
this in the bud, Eric.\\
218 - All right, all right.\\
219 - The bridge of
the nose is very vulnerable.\\
220 - Oh, oh...\\
221 - And hit him with a banjo.\\
222 - A banjo, Bob?\\
223 - What? I'm helping.\\
224 - Where is he gonna get a banjo?\\
225 - I don't know.\\
226 - But I saw a guy get hit with a
banjo once, and he went down.\\
227 - Hitting a guy with
a banjo is dirty.\\
228 - You wanna knee him in the groin.\\
229 - You can hit him in
the groin with a banjo.\\
230 - So, what do you
want to do tonight?\\
231 - And if you say,
"See Star Wars again,"\\
232 - I'm leaving.\\
233 - You don't want to leave.\\
234 - You want to see Star Wars.\\
235 - Stop it!
I have had it with you.\\
236 - You are weird
and I'm going home!\\
237 - Jackie...\\
238 - Huh, boy, that's terrible
the way she treats you.\\
239 - Right?\\
240 - You know, I saw Star Wars\\
241 - and I'm not a movie expert,\\
242 - but I think it's safe to say\\
243 - it was the greatest film
of all time.\\
244 - Finally...\\
245 - someone who understands!\\
246 - Yeah.\\
247 - You know, Kelso, I always
thought you were kind of dumb.\\
248 - Uh-huh.\\
249 - But I don't care.\\
250 - You know, I don't either.\\
251 - It's...\\
252 - Where's Eric?\\
253 - Um...\\
254 - I don't know.\\
255 - I think you do know, Red.\\
256 - All right, Kitty.\\
257 - Some kid's been hitting on Donna\\
258 - so he went to fight him.
But it's no big deal.\\
259 - No big deal.
You men are such Neanderthals!\\
260 - Fighting over a woman.
It's ridiculous.\\
261 - It's like that time
at that beach\\
262 - when that lifeguard
pinched my fanny.\\
263 - You just had to lay
him out, didn't you?\\
264 - Well, yeah.\\
265 - Well, how do you think
I felt, Red?\\
266 - Watching you stand
over that poor man...\\
267 - your... your eyes
burning with intensity...\\
268 - your, your suntanned muscles
gleaming like a bronzed god.\\
269 - Okay, you and me, right now.\\
270 - Eric, what are you doing?\\
271 - This isn't about you, Donna.\\
272 - Eric, stop it.\\
273 - - Yeah, that's right. Hold me back.
- Stop it!\\
274 - Eric, for the last time...\\
275 - David has no
interest in me whatsoever!\\
276 - Yeah, I do.\\
277 - What?\\
278 - Why do you think we've been
spending so much time together?\\
279 - 'Cause we're friends?\\
280 - Oh, come on, Donna.\\
281 - I mean, I've talked to you,\\
282 - I've listened to you,
I've shared ideas with you.\\
283 - What's that about?\\
284 - I had the exact same problem
with...\\
285 - What?\\
286 - I don't know what
it takes with women.\\
287 - I mean, you put in all this time
and effort, and they wanna be...\\
288 - ...just friends.\\
289 - I know. I hate that.\\
290 - Man, and to think
I was going to kick your ass.\\
291 - Hey, you had every reason.\\
292 - You hear that, Donna?
"Every reason."\\
293 - You know what, Eric?\\
294 - You don't trust me
and you don't respect me.\\
295 - No...\\
296 - No, Donna,
I was just trying to...\\
297 - Get away from me!\\
298 - Well, it wouldn't have worked
out with her and me anyway.\\
299 - I mean, I'm not
supposed to say anything\\
300 - but we're just here until my dad\\
301 - closes down the plant.\\
302 - Wait. Closes...\\
303 - Your dad was
opening the plant full-time.\\
304 - Yeah, well, they're
burning off the inventory\\
305 - and then, that's all she wrote.\\
306 - My dad's depending on that job.\\
307 - Yeah, well, I guess
he should have thought ahead\\
308 - like my dad.\\
309 - Hey...\\
310 - You bastard!
You broke my nose!\\
311 - That's... Good!\\
312 - You'll pay for this,\\
313 - Forman!\\
314 - Before I leave,
Donna will be mine!\\
315 - Hey, Dad.\\
316 - Hey, Dad, can I talk to you?\\
317 - Absolutely.\\
318 - Eric,\\
319 - I am very, very disappointed
in you for fighting.\\
320 - I'm sorry.\\
321 - It's okay.\\
322 - See you in the car.\\
323 - Where are you guys going?\\
324 - Oh, taking your mother out
for dinner and a movie.\\
325 - A little, uh, celebration.\\
326 - You know, son, sometimes life\\
327 - gives you a good bounce.\\
328 - So, what'd you
want to talk about?\\
329 - Um...\\
330 - Have a good time.\\
331 - Oh, yeah.\\
332 - Hey, little brother,
I made out with Kelso.\\
333 - Shut up!\\
334 - What is wrong with you?\\
335 - Everything is wrong.\\
336 - Donna's mad at me...\\
337 - and the plant's closing,
Dad's out of a job.\\
338 - Oh, wow.\\
339 - Guess this is a bad time
to tell him\\
340 - I flunked out of college.\\
341 - You know what, Laurie?
I cannot believe\\
342 - that you're the favorite.\\
343 - Yeah, doesn't it kick ass?\\
344 - Oh... That Vader's got him.
There's no way out of this.\\
345 - Is this a true story?\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - That voice.
I...\\
348 - James Earl Jones!\\
349 - Eric actually liked this?\\
350 - That kid's on dope.\\
351 - Whoa.
\subsection {Episode 21: Water Tower}
1 - Oh, my God.\\
2 - From up here,\\
3 - Point Place looks
just like Paris.\\
4 - You think that looks like Paris?\\
5 - God, no wonder you think
Kelso could be a model.\\
6 - Whoa! I could
so be a model.\\
7 - Come on, man. Shut
up and just keep painting.\\
8 - It's done!\\
9 - Gentlemen, we have
finally done it.\\
10 - A pot leaf on the water tower!\\
11 - This is the proudest
moment of my life.\\
12 - It doesn't look like a pot leaf.\\
13 - What?\\
14 - It looks like a
hand giving the finger.\\
15 - It doesn't have to look
perfect, Hyde. It's art.\\
16 - Get up and make it better!\\
17 - Fine!\\
18 - Just... Yeah,
make it wider right up there.\\
19 - Yeah. Out further,
though.\\
20 - Yeah.
Right up there.\\
21 - Oh, my God.
Michael!\\
22 - Hey, Kelso!\\
23 - Yeah?\\
24 - How's it look from down there?\\
25 - It looks like
it's giving me the finger.\\
26 - You guys, this is so stupid.\\
27 - We should just take him
to the hospital.\\
28 - No, Jackie. Then my dad
will find out...\\
29 - Shut up!\\
30 - Okay. My mom's a nurse.\\
31 - I'm going to go wake her
up. Maybe she can fix him.\\
32 - Just don't wake up Red,
though, huh? He'll kill us all.\\
33 - Gee, you think?\\
34 - Oh, Red!\\
35 - Oh, Kitty!\\
36 - Okay, let's go.\\
37 - Everybody hop in the
car, and let's go now.\\
38 - Where's your mom?\\
39 - Shut up! Don't you dare
talk about my mother!\\
40 - Hangin' out\\
41 - Down the street\\
42 - The same old thing\\
43 - We did last week\\
44 - Not a thing to do\\
45 - But talk to you\\
46 - Whoa, yeah\\
47 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
48 - No. Dad...\\
49 - There's no way this
could've been avoided.\\
50 - Yes! No...\\
51 - Yeah, the cow kicked me
after I tipped it over.\\
52 - I'm not lying!\\
53 - Okay. All right.\\
54 - I love you, too.\\
55 - He bought it.\\
56 - Um, excuse me.
Um, yes. Um...\\
57 - My friend and I would like
our sponge bath now, please.\\
58 - Eric, are you all right?
They were sleeping!\\
59 - Michael, as God is my witness,\\
60 - I will nurse you back to health.\\
61 - Thanks, Jackie.\\
62 - I'm in a lot of pain.\\
63 - Oh, my poor baby.\\
64 - All right! All right.
That's it.\\
65 - I'm going, whoever wants a ride.\\
66 - Hey, I'm sorry
about tonight, you guys.\\
67 - Sorry? Why?\\
68 - We got to watch you
fall, man. I had a blast!\\
69 - See you, Kelso.\\
70 - Hyde is such a jerk.\\
71 - This is all his fault.\\
72 - What are you talking about?\\
73 - Who said the pot leaf
wasn't good enough?\\
74 - Hyde did.\\
75 - Mmm-hmm, and who said
you should lean out further?\\
76 - Hyde did.\\
77 - So who made you fall
off the water tower?\\
78 - No, no, no, no, wait, Jackie.\\
79 - That's crazy. Hyde's,
like, my best friend.\\
80 - No, no, no, no.
Brian Piccolo\\
81 - and Gayle Sayers
were best friends.\\
82 - Yeah. Brian's Song.\\
83 - I love that movie.\\
84 - See, Michael,
Gayle held Brian's hand\\
85 - and cried and gave him
sips of cool water\\
86 - in his hospital bed.\\
87 - Yeah.\\
88 - So where are you now?\\
89 - I'm in a hospital bed.\\
90 - And where's Hyde?\\
91 - Well, he isn't giving me
sips of cool water,\\
92 - that's for sure!\\
93 - Well, we got vandals
in this town.\\
94 - I was driving home, and I saw
the water tower giving me the finger.\\
95 - Vandals, you say?\\
96 - Hmm, where were you
last night, Eric?\\
97 - Oh, can it, Laurie.\\
98 - Eric, you look pale.\\
99 - Let me see your eyes.\\
100 - Look at me.\\
101 - Do you have a fever?\\
102 - Oh.\\
103 - I know what you need.\\
104 - Right after breakfast,
I want you to mow the lawn.\\
105 - The fresh air will do you good.\\
106 - Eric, is something
bothering you?\\
107 - God, make it stop!\\
108 - Oh, Kitty!\\
109 - Oh, Kitty!\\
110 - Oh, Kitty!\\
111 - Oh, Kitty!\\
112 - Oh, Red!\\
113 - Oh, Kitty!
Oh, Kitty!\\
114 - Oh, Red!
Oh, Red!\\
115 - Well, okay, now, um...\\
116 - So far, Eric is nine out of 10.\\
117 - He's got... He's got
bloodshot eyes, mood swings,\\
118 - irregular appetite,
odd sleeping patterns.\\
119 - Oh, Red, our Johnny is high.\\
120 - Kitty, that's nonsense.\\
121 - He's not on drugs.\\
122 - He's just weird.\\
123 - Morning.\\
124 - Hungry?\\
125 - I... I overslept.\\
126 - I'm late for school.\\
127 - It's, uh...\\
128 - Bye.\\
129 - That kid's on dope.\\
130 - Well, I'll say.
It's Sunday.\\
131 - Boy, these afterschool
specials are thrilling.\\
132 - I mean, who knew
it takes only one beer\\
133 - to turn a cheerleader
into a whore?\\
134 - You know, Fez, this show
contains an important message.\\
135 - That very thing happened
to a good friend of mine.\\
136 - Really?
Mmm-hmm.\\
137 - Uh, may I ask who?\\
138 - Man, that is one drunk,
slutty cheerleader.\\
139 - There go her pom-poms.\\
140 - All right!
All right!\\
141 - That is quite enough!\\
142 - Everywhere I look now,\\
143 - it's sex, sex, sex!
Well, it's disgusting,\\
144 - and I for one will not
have it in my basement!\\
145 - Eric, what's wrong with you?\\
146 - Oh, well, excuse me, Donna,
for having a little moral fiber.\\
147 - Okay. Well, I'm going
to go check on Michael.\\
148 - Yeah,
how's he doing?\\
149 - Oh! Oh, yeah,
like you care.\\
150 - Why don't you just apologize?\\
151 - Apologize for what?\\
152 - Well, if you don't know,\\
153 - then obviously
you're a big fat jerk!\\
154 - Okay. She's nuts.\\
155 - I know.
You are not fat.\\
156 - Eric.
Get off my mom...\\
157 - What?\\
158 - What is it with you?\\
159 - You've been extra losery lately.\\
160 - I saw Mom and Dad having sex.\\
161 - Oh!\\
162 - Oh, you poor thing!\\
163 - It's all right.
It's okay. Baby's fine.\\
164 - Oh, Laurie, it was horrible.\\
165 - I can't get the image
out of my mind!\\
166 - I mean, it was Mom and Dad,
but they were...\\
167 - They were like
a pair of wildebeests\\
168 - on a National Geographic
Special.\\
169 - Deep in
the unexplored psyche\\
170 - of a confused young man,\\
171 - is a wilderness called\\
172 - Wild Wisconsin.\\
173 - After several days of tracking,\\
174 - we finally located
the den of the wily Red.\\
175 - Here we see suburbus sexmaniacus\\
176 - tracking his prey
through the living room.\\
177 - Observe as the male indicates
his interest in mating\\
178 - by making loud,
aggressive noises.\\
179 - The female's attractive
double-knit pantsuit\\
180 - and scarlet lips
signal her readiness.\\
181 - This display is not lost
on the male.\\
182 - Oh, here he goes.\\
183 - Let's watch.\\
184 - Eric, I am so sorry.\\
185 - But you have to understand.\\
186 - Mom and Dad are in love.\\
187 - They have urges
and needs, just like us.\\
188 - No urges, no needs!\\
189 - I learned in psychology class\\
190 - that what you went
through is traumatic,\\
191 - but don't worry,\\
192 - many people have had
this same experience.\\
193 - Really? And they
turned out all right?\\
194 - Well, some of them turned
out to be serial killers.\\
195 - But I'm sure that's
just a coincidence.\\
196 - But whatever.\\
197 - You know what the sad thing is?\\
198 - I actually think
you're trying to be nice.\\
199 - Yeah.\\
200 - It's just not my strong suit.\\
201 - Sorry.\\
202 - So I'll be all right?\\
203 - No.\\
204 - Donna, I'm really
not in the mood.\\
205 - Now, come on.\\
206 - I'm just trying to get
a little action here.\\
207 - Donna, I just can't.\\
208 - Come on. All the
other guys are doing it.\\
209 - What's going on? Are you,
like, mad at me or something?\\
210 - Donna, I saw
my parents having sex.\\
211 - Oh, God!\\
212 - Yeah.\\
213 - And you liked it, right?\\
214 - No! God, no!
That's sick!\\
215 - Everyone's sick!\\
216 - I'm kidding.\\
217 - Eric, I'm kidding.\\
218 - Oh.\\
219 - Good one.\\
220 - All right, look,\\
221 - I'm going to tell you something
I've never told anybody else.\\
222 - All right?\\
223 - When I was 12,
I saw my parents doing it.\\
224 - How... How did you
get over it?\\
225 - Well, at first, I was, like,
completely freaked out.\\
226 - But then eventually
the pain receded,\\
227 - and I was able to live again.\\
228 - Donna, I don't
see this receding.\\
229 - I mean, I walked in on Red
and Kitty, and they were...\\
230 - They were right in the middle.\\
231 - Oh, God. That's nothing.\\
232 - I caught my parents outside, in
broad daylight, on the hammock.\\
233 - Where I used to read, like,
my Nancy Drew Mysteries.\\
234 - Oh, man, that is
so much worse than mine.\\
235 - Oh, God.\\
236 - I can remember, like,\\
237 - little bits of naked skin peeking
through the holes of the hammock.\\
238 - Wow.\\
239 - It's weird, but knowing
what you went through\\
240 - just makes me feel
so much better,\\
241 - because you're, like,
totally over it. Right?\\
242 - And later,\\
243 - they came inside\\
244 - and they had, like,\\
245 - this checkerboard pattern
all over their arms and legs!\\
246 - And my dad laughed\\
247 - and said they fell asleep
on the hammock.\\
248 - But I knew it was a lie.\\
249 - I knew what he did to my mom.\\
250 - Your mom.\\
251 - Okay, I'm ready to fool around.\\
252 - Please take me home.
Okay.\\
253 - Oh. Hey, look, Jackie.
It's my friends,\\
254 - Eric, Donna, and Fez.\\
255 - Yep, that's all my friends.\\
256 - Kelso, if you have
something to say to me,\\
257 - why don't you just say it?\\
258 - Oh, no.\\
259 - Oh, no.\\
260 - I think you have
something to say to me,\\
261 - and I'm going to be right
over here when you're ready.\\
262 - All right, all right!
This is stupid.\\
263 - Hyde, just apologize already.\\
264 - It's not my fault.\\
265 - Whatever.
He thinks it is.\\
266 - It is!\\
267 - You made me fall off
the water tower.\\
268 - How? Did I push you?
No, but...\\
269 - Did I make the railing slippery?\\
270 - No. Then how is it my fault?\\
271 - Because!\\
272 - You didn't like my artwork.\\
273 - And you don't
respect me\\
274 - and you laugh at me\\
275 - and you're inconsiderate
of my feelings.\\
276 - No offense, but you
sound like a chick.\\
277 - Well...\\
278 - Man, I do!\\
279 - Okay. All right.\\
280 - Do you remember that time
when I was climbing your fence\\
281 - and I hit my forehead
on that tree branch,\\
282 - and I fell into your yard\\
283 - and your dog Yogi
came out of the house\\
284 - and bit me twice on the ass?\\
285 - Yeah.\\
286 - You bled and you cried.\\
287 - I bled.
I didn't cry.\\
288 - Yeah, you did.\\
289 - You bled and you cried.\\
290 - And you laughed, man, a lot,\\
291 - while I was bleeding.\\
292 - Do you see my point? Yeah.
It's funny when friends get hurt.\\
293 - Close enough.\\
294 - Sorry. Stop
talking like a chick.\\
295 - Oh, oh.\\
296 - God, you're both idiots!\\
297 - Eric?\\
298 - Your father and I have noticed\\
299 - that you've been acting
very strange lately.\\
300 - Like a hippie.\\
301 - Is there something
you want to tell us?\\
302 - Are you on dope?
Are you?\\
303 - Because... Because we can
help get you clean.\\
304 - There's counseling,
hospitalization...\\
305 - My foot kicking your ass.\\
306 - Mom, Dad, I'm not on drugs.\\
307 - Oh, what a relief.
You have no idea...\\
308 - Kitty, Kitty, he's lying.\\
309 - That's what the hopheads do.\\
310 - Mom, Dad, I swear,
I'm not on drugs.\\
311 - Well then, what the
hell's wrong with you?\\
312 - Well, I accidentally... I
was upstairs, and I, I...\\
313 - Okay, you know what?
I'm on drugs.\\
314 - Oh, for God's sake!
He saw you guys doing it!\\
315 - There.\\
316 - I helped!\\
317 - Oh, honey.\\
318 - Were your father and I
having intercourse?\\
319 - Mom!\\
320 - Well, no wonder you've
been acting so weird.\\
321 - Red, say something.
Make him feel better.\\
322 - Um...\\
323 - It's more fun than it looks.\\
324 - Red.\\
325 - What? What do you
want me to say?\\
326 - Hey, you know what?\\
327 - Um, you guys do it,\\
328 - and, um, I'm okay with that.\\
329 - So...\\
330 - Thanks.\\
331 - I just hope you
learned your lesson.\\
332 - Oh.\\
333 - Yes, sir, I did.\\
334 - Wait a second.
What lesson?\\
335 - Always knock.
Oh.\\
336 - Oh! Oh, even in the
middle of the afternoon.\\
337 - Oh, my God!\\
338 - Damn, that was funny.\\
339 - Well, I don't... I don't
know how funny it is.\\
340 - I mean, what if that had been
you walking in on your parents?\\
341 - And your mother was a dancer.\\
342 - I imagine that would've
been quite something.\\
343 - Quit it, Kitty.\\
344 - Oh. Hey, don't.\\
345 - Come on now.
Stop that.\\
346 - Boy, Kelso's going
to be so happy\\
347 - that I finished his graffiti.\\
348 - Oh, yes.\\
349 - I am very talented.\\
350 - Oh, no!\\
351 - I am hurt...\\
352 - And all alone...\\
353 - And it is giving me the finger!
\subsection {Episode 22: Punk Chick}
1 - What are you doing?\\
2 - Nothing.\\
3 - How's it going back there?\\
4 - Okay, Donna, just for that,
I'm not taking your bra off.\\
5 - Well, you weren't
taking it off anyway.\\
6 - Hello, House of Chicken?\\
7 - How big are your wings?\\
8 - Breasts.\\
9 - Oh.\\
10 - How big are your breasts?\\
11 - This is Fez, who is this?\\
12 - My first prank call.\\
13 - Every night with
you is an adventure.\\
14 - Yeah, Fez, it's a real
roller coaster, ain't it?\\
15 - Hyde, how come
you do not have a girlfriend?\\
16 - Maybe if you did
something with your hair.\\
17 - Hey, you, is there
a motel in this pukehole?\\
18 - There's a Sleepy Time Lodge
three pukeholes over.\\
19 - Thanks. I'm Chrissy.\\
20 - I'm Hyde.
Who cares.\\
21 - You wanna hop on my Vespa
and, uh, show me where it is?\\
22 - Mother of God,
I think I love you.\\
23 - Love is an outdated concept,\\
24 - used by industrialists
to keep women subservient.\\
25 - Mother of God, I do love you.\\
26 - Hanging out\\
27 - Down the street\\
28 - The same old thing\\
29 - We did last week\\
30 - Not a thing to do\\
31 - But talk to you\\
32 - Whoa, yeah\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - Damn.\\
35 - Damn.\\
36 - Damn.\\
37 - What happened?\\
38 - What happen...
You just beat me 15-nothing.\\
39 - So what?\\
40 - I mean, hitting a ball
with two paddles is so boring.\\
41 - I need a new challenge,
something totally different.\\
42 - I need to hit the ball with...\\
43 - with smaller paddles.\\
44 - Where's Red keep his tools?\\
45 - Oh, no. Not Red's Pong.\\
46 - I don't think you should
be going...\\
47 - The garage! Of course!\\
48 - Okay, you know,
if you screw that up,\\
49 - he's gonna blame me.\\
50 - I know.\\
51 - Who'd have thought I'd meet
a radical number like you\\
52 - in a slag heap town like this.\\
53 - I can't believe you're just
passing through, man.\\
54 - You're dark, you're obnoxious...\\
55 - you're dangerously paranoid.\\
56 - Until tonight, I didn't even
know a girl like you existed.\\
57 - Has it occurred to
you that we're on a bed?\\
58 - Oh, man, this is so perfect.\\
59 - You're easy, too?\\
60 - Yeah.\\
61 - See, the establishment
doesn't want us having sex\\
62 - - because they know
it makes us feel good, right?
- Yeah.\\
63 - So if we can
feel good on our own,\\
64 - what do we need
the establishment for?\\
65 - So, every time we have sex,\\
66 - it's a huge protest.\\
67 - You know what?\\
68 - I think I feel
a huge protest coming on.\\
69 - Thank you so much\\
70 - for helping with my home
ec project, Mrs. Forman.\\
71 - Well, you're welcome, honey.\\
72 - Now, Jackie, have you ever
made a pie before?\\
73 - No, I don't really cook much.\\
74 - I just plan on
getting by on my looks.\\
75 - Okay, then.\\
76 - Michael.\\
77 - Jackie.\\
78 - What are you doing here?\\
79 - I'm baking a pie.\\
80 - I'm making small paddles.\\
81 - Fine.\\
82 - Fine.\\
83 - So, Donna, what say you
and I take a little drive tonight?\\
84 - I don't know.\\
85 - Do you think you can
unlock the car?\\
86 - Hmm. Where should\\
87 - the three of us go on our drive?\\
88 - Actually, Fez, just, um,
Donna and I are gonna...\\
89 - Oh, I see.\\
90 - So, you are going to ditch me.\\
91 - Just like Hyde.\\
92 - Every day, I am here
with my heart on my sleeve...\\
93 - hoping only for
friendship and acceptance.\\
94 - And what do I get?\\
95 - Abandonment.\\
96 - Loneliness.\\
97 - When is it Fez's turn?\\
98 - Where is my whore?\\
99 - Damn you, Hyde.\\
100 - Did you go horseback
riding without me?\\
101 - No.\\
102 - I just met the most
amazing woman. Chrissy.\\
103 - And she just ditched
her entire life\\
104 - to start over in New York, man.\\
105 - Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
106 - Why is she... Why is she
going to New York?\\
107 - She's going to start
a punk band.\\
108 - A punk band.\\
109 - Cool. What is punk anyways?\\
110 - Punk is the nihilistic outcry\\
111 - against the corporate
rock and roll takeover.\\
112 - It's the soundtrack
to the revolution, man.\\
113 - I thought you said
Blue Oyster Cult\\
114 - was the soundtrack
to the revolution.\\
115 - Look, the point is, is that...\\
116 - she asked me to go with her.\\
117 - Whoa, whoa. Why would you want
to go to New York?\\
118 - Well, it's a big city, man,\\
119 - the bars are open
until 4:00,\\
120 - that's where all
the music's happening.\\
121 - Hey...\\
122 - If I can make it there...\\
123 - You can't make it there.\\
124 - But if I can make it there...\\
125 - But, you won't make it there.\\
126 - Would you just listen?\\
127 - If I can make it there...\\
128 - Damn it, Forman, now I
lost my train of thought!\\
129 - Kelso! You have 10 seconds
to tell me what you're doing.\\
130 - I can explain...
Nine seconds!\\
131 - See... Okay...
Eight!\\
132 - ...but the counting...
Three.\\
133 - What?\\
134 - No! There's no way
that was five seconds.\\
135 - It is now. Three!\\
136 - I just wanted...
Two.\\
137 - Smaller paddles.
Time!\\
138 - Don't hurt me!\\
139 - Smaller paddles?\\
140 - Is it broken?\\
141 - Okay, I'm too good at Pong.\\
142 - It's a curse.\\
143 - I know what you mean.
It's boring.\\
144 - I haven't played this thing
in over a month.\\
145 - Right, right. Exactly.
Okay, now stay with me here.\\
146 - That's why I took it apart.\\
147 - See, smaller paddles
equal bigger fun.\\
148 - You may have something there.\\
149 - We'll give it a try.\\
150 - Seeing as you already opened it.\\
151 - Great.
And hey...\\
152 - if we can't put it back
together, you owe me $118.\\
153 - I don't have $118.\\
154 - Well, then
I'll have to kill you.\\
155 - Okay. Okay.\\
156 - Jackie, all right, honey.
Let's, let's just review.\\
157 - What do you think
went wrong with this pie?\\
158 - Too many eggs?
No.\\
159 - The pan was too small?\\
160 - Not even close.\\
161 - Is it because Michael doesn't
love me anymore?\\
162 - Almost.\\
163 - It's because you were talking\\
164 - on the phone about Michael\\
165 - instead of watching the pie,
like you\\
166 - promised me you would this time.\\
167 - Again.\\
168 - You liar.\\
169 - I don't know, Hyde.
I mean, here,\\
170 - you're the cool guy.\\
171 - But do you know how many
cool guys live in New York?\\
172 - There's like...\\
173 - Lou Reed, man!\\
174 - Do you want to mess with that?\\
175 - Why do you want to
leave Point Place?\\
176 - It is fun.\\
177 - Yeah, it is fun, man...\\
178 - and I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you guys.\\
179 - But Chrissy's cool.\\
180 - And it's the Big Apple, man.\\
181 - Do you think
Lou Reed's in the phone book?\\
182 - Because I bet
he'd really like me.\\
183 - Lou Reed.\\
184 - Where are you going?\\
185 - Who's Chrissy?\\
186 - It's not bad here, man.
We got the TV and...\\
187 - peanut butter.
And I got this thing.\\
188 - Well, the ball part
rolled under the dryer.\\
189 - Hyde, you cannot leave.\\
190 - You gave me my first beer,
remember?\\
191 - And then I threw up on that cop.\\
192 - That was a good time, man.\\
193 - Wait a minute, back up.\\
194 - Nobody tells me anything.\\
195 - What's the ball
doing under the dryer?\\
196 - So, Hyde's like...
Hyde's like really leaving.\\
197 - Yeah.\\
198 - It's like...\\
199 - time's just passing us by.\\
200 - You know, you've got to like...\\
201 - seize the day.\\
202 - You are so right.
Yeah.\\
203 - Okay, what's so funny?\\
204 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
205 - Uh...
No, tell me.\\
206 - I know you're going for the bra.\\
207 - How... How did you know?\\
208 - It's just, every time you go for
my bra, your lips stop moving.\\
209 - So, um...\\
210 - you're really
not having any fun?\\
211 - No, I'm having a good time.\\
212 - I would just like a little
attention while you're\\
213 - struggling with my underwear.\\
214 - I'm here too.\\
215 - It doesn't always have to be
about the twins.\\
216 - The twins?\\
217 - Is that what you call them?\\
218 - That is so very hot.\\
219 - Okay. Yeah...\\
220 - Take me home.\\
221 - Jackie...\\
222 - just take the money
and buy a pie.\\
223 - Mrs. Forman, if I buy a pie,
that's cheating and I'll fail.\\
224 - Trust me. If you bake it,
you'll fail, too.\\
225 - What's this about
Hyde moving to New York?\\
226 - No, no. He's only 17.\\
227 - His mother would never
let him do that.\\
228 - Actually, Michael told me
that Hyde's mom drinks a lot.\\
229 - She probably won't even care.\\
230 - You know, drunk people
are like that.\\
231 - Okay...\\
232 - let's make another pie.\\
233 - I will make the filling...\\
234 - and I will make the crust.\\
235 - What will I make?\\
236 - You will go into the living room\\
237 - and make me a drink.\\
238 - He can't just drop
out of high school.\\
239 - And New York City is no place
for a 17-year-old kid.\\
240 - It's Sodom and Gomorrah
with a subway.\\
241 - We'll have to have
a talk with him.\\
242 - His mom sure as hell
won't do it.\\
243 - And somebody's got
to beat some sense\\
244 - into that idiot.\\
245 - Oh, Red, you do care.\\
246 - Are you ready to rock and roll?\\
247 - We don't think
that you should go.\\
248 - New York is a dangerous place.\\
249 - A young man today
needs a high school diploma.\\
250 - In New York, you get mugged
for no good reason.\\
251 - Do you have any idea
what the job market is like?\\
252 - The people are rude.\\
253 - And you have feelings.\\
254 - Without that sheepskin,
you are nothing.\\
255 - And not the kind of nothing
that you are now.\\
256 - An even lower,
more pathetic nothing.\\
257 - They spit.
That's right, they spit!\\
258 - What are you gonna
put on your resume?\\
259 - "Dumbass"?\\
260 - I'm not afraid of anything,
and I'm going.\\
261 - Well, that didn't go that great.\\
262 - Way to go, Kitty.\\
263 - Hey, don't touch!\\
264 - I'm about to take
off the doohickey.\\
265 - Red! Don't you think
we should disconnect the\\
266 - transistor from the secondary
circuit board first?\\
267 - Well... Sure.\\
268 - And then, we'll, uh...
work on the, uh...\\
269 - doohickey.\\
270 - Bitching.\\
271 - It is too my suitcase!\\
272 - Nothing in
this house is yours!\\
273 - Shut up!\\
274 - So, your mom's
taking it pretty hard, huh?\\
275 - Oh, I haven't told her yet.\\
276 - So, Hyde, you're, like...\\
277 - really going through with this?\\
278 - Yeah, man.\\
279 - I mean, you know. I know
people spit on you there\\
280 - and the rats are as big
as your head or whatever.\\
281 - But this might be my only
chance to escape, Forman.\\
282 - Hey, you can't leave now.\\
283 - We're finally getting
old enough to do some\\
284 - serious damage to this town.\\
285 - Remember we were gonna
paint that pot leaf\\
286 - on the water tower?\\
287 - Vandalism, while tempting...\\
288 - is not enough
reason for me to stay.\\
289 - Plus, you can
do that without me.\\
290 - But we won't do
that without you.\\
291 - Hyde, you're the reason
we do so many\\
292 - stupid, senseless things.\\
293 - Yeah, that is true.\\
294 - Hyde, I've never told this
to another human being...\\
295 - but I...\\
296 - I...\\
297 - Cannot get Donna's bra off.\\
298 - - Hooks or snaps?
- Both. She keeps
throwing me changeups.\\
299 - All right, here's
what you do, okay?\\
300 - You buy a bra and you
practice on it at home...\\
301 - then you give it
to Donna as a gift.\\
302 - See! That's brilliant.\\
303 - You're like an evil genius, man!\\
304 - Where's your bag?\\
305 - You're not going.\\
306 - No.\\
307 - But I'd like to
mount another protest\\
308 - if you have the time.\\
309 - This is my, um... My friend's
number in New York.\\
310 - Don't call me.\\
311 - Yeah, I won't.\\
312 - Hey, Chrissy...\\
313 - do you mind if I
steal the towels?\\
314 - Sorry.
I already got them.\\
315 - Well, Kelso. Good luck.\\
316 - Yeah, she's been
a great ride, man.\\
317 - It worked!\\
318 - Smaller paddles!\\
319 - Congratulations, son.\\
320 - You have seen the future.\\
321 - Yeah, yeah.
You're so right, Red.\\
322 - Home computers.
That is the future.\\
323 - No, no, no. Not computers.
Soldering.\\
324 - The future is soldering.\\
325 - Computers.\\
326 - Well, what do you know,
we're parked again.\\
327 - Right, but this time
I just want to talk.\\
328 - Donna, I'm really sorry\\
329 - if I did anything to make you
feel uncomfortable.\\
330 - Oh, thanks.\\
331 - I guess part of that's my fault.\\
332 - But I think I know something
that will make you feel better.\\
333 - Okay.\\
334 - Well... You know, I've been
having a rough time lately\\
335 - because now that we're
boyfriend and girlfriend\\
336 - and now that you know
I'm on the pill\\
337 - it's like you're
always pawing at me.\\
338 - And I wanna fool around,
but then I think\\
339 - if you get to second base,
then you'll have\\
340 - a pretty good view of home
and if that happens,\\
341 - who knows what will happen
to you and me?\\
342 - Just look at what happened
to Jackie and Kelso\\
343 - and sex changes everything
and that really, really sucks.\\
344 - Okay.\\
345 - Um, so, what part of that was
supposed to make me feel better?\\
346 - I'm not wearing a bra.\\
347 - You are the best
girlfriend ever.\\
348 - You surprised to see me?\\
349 - No, I knew you'd stay.\\
350 - Yeah, we've been
friends way too long.\\
351 - No, Chrissy just drove by with
some guy on the back of her bike.\\
352 - Poor kid.\\
353 - She's grieving.
\subsection {Episode 23: Grandma's Dead}
1 - Oh, um, here, Bernice,\\
2 - I, I made you a plate
of leftovers.\\
3 - Oh, thank you.
Oh, that reminds me, Red,\\
4 - my garbage disposal
is still broken.\\
5 - Well, just as long
as you enjoy it.\\
6 - Listen, I've got an idea.
Let's eat out next Sunday.\\
7 - That way everybody
can get something they like.\\
8 - Okay, Grandma,
time to get you home.\\
9 - Eric, you gotta warm that car up\\
10 - for at least 10 minutes.\\
11 - Oh. He's a good boy.\\
12 - It's just a shame he doesn't
have a better home life.\\
13 - Uh, you know, Kitty,
when I was raising children,\\
14 - the right way...\\
15 - - That's warm enough, Eric.
- But you just said...\\
16 - Show me tail lights.\\
17 - Let's roll, grandma.\\
18 - Turn off that beatnik music.\\
19 - Watch the road.\\
20 - You don't like it
when I come to visit.\\
21 - Yes, I do. I really do.\\
22 - You're a filthy liar.\\
23 - You didn't learn
to lie from my Red.\\
24 - That came from your mother.\\
25 - Well, you see, Grandma,\\
26 - that's the problem
right there, okay?\\
27 - Every time you come to my house,\\
28 - you spend the whole day
criticizing my mom.\\
29 - Well, I tell it like it is.\\
30 - Okay, Grandma,
then here's how it is.\\
31 - You're very nasty.\\
32 - And I... I don't see why
you have to be so hateful.\\
33 - I don't think being nice for
a whole day would kill you.\\
34 - Grandma?\\
35 - Grandma?\\
36 - Oh... Oh, God.\\
37 - Hey. What's going on?\\
38 - Just shooting some hoops.\\
39 - Oh, I'll get it.\\
40 - Eric, what's your grandma
doing sleeping in the car?\\
41 - She's not, uh...\\
42 - She's not sleeping.
She's dead.\\
43 - No, really. She's dead.\\
44 - Wh... What?\\
45 - What... What are you
talking about, she's dead?\\
46 - I, uh, was driving her home\\
47 - and then I yelled at her
and then she died.\\
48 - She died? I mean,
what did Red say?\\
49 - Oh, I'm not telling Red.\\
50 - Um, Eric, I don't mean to
criticize, but are you insane?\\
51 - You need to do something.\\
52 - Eric, I just gotta get
my eight-track out of the car.\\
53 - Kelso!\\
54 - Grandma Forman,
can you just\\
55 - move your leg
a little bit, there?\\
56 - Kelso, she's dead.\\
57 - Oh, my God!\\
58 - Oh, my God!\\
59 - Eric, you're in shock.\\
60 - You have to go inside
and tell Red, right now.\\
61 - Wait, um... will you do it?\\
62 - Please, right now.\\
63 - Oh...\\
64 - I forgot the Tupperware.\\
65 - Oh. She sent back
the leftovers.\\
66 - This is so typical
of your grandmother.\\
67 - Why do I even put up with her?\\
68 - Mom, I think you might be
coming down\\
69 - a little hard on Grandma
this time.\\
70 - Well, you know what? She is just
an evil, evil horrible little woman.\\
71 - What did she say
about me this time?\\
72 - Not much.\\
73 - So, did you get your
Grandma home, okay?\\
74 - Well, um... You know,
the strangest thing happened.\\
75 - Okay, now here's
the part where I get lost.\\
76 - How did she hit the sidewalk?\\
77 - Well, I opened
the door for her...\\
78 - And what the hell was going
through your head when you did that?\\
79 - Oh, just yell at him, Red.\\
80 - I'm sure that his
grandmother dying\\
81 - hasn't upset him enough.\\
82 - Eric, take your mother in
the house. She's hysterical.\\
83 - Yes, sir. And, um...\\
84 - I have to tell you, sir,
when we were driving...\\
85 - I said to Grandma...
I said...\\
86 - Eric, this is no time
to get upset.\\
87 - Well, when is the right time?\\
88 - I'll handle this, Eric, you just
take your mother in the house.\\
89 - Mom.\\
90 - Well, this...
this is a terrible loss.\\
91 - Mom, didn't you just
say that she was evil?\\
92 - I never said any such thing.\\
93 - Okay.\\
94 - Oh, Sweetie, I am
so glad you're here.\\
95 - Yeah, I had a final this week.\\
96 - Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.\\
97 - Oh, no, this couldn't
have come at a better time.\\
98 - I was really unprepared.\\
99 - But I miss Grandma.\\
100 - I know, honey. We all do.\\
101 - Mom, what is with all this food?\\
102 - Well, you know,
busy hands are happy hands.\\
103 - Oh, say, would you like\\
104 - a cup of chili
with your waffles?\\
105 - Oh, I don't know. Sure.\\
106 - So, how did your
brother take the news?\\
107 - Oh, you know Marty. He
was talking about his feelings\\
108 - and then he started bawling,
so I hung up on him.\\
109 - I'm not paying
long distance rates\\
110 - to listen to that crap.\\
111 - Uncle Marty is so in touch
with his feelings.\\
112 - It's like he's
completely self-actualized.\\
113 - He's a dumb ass.\\
114 - Now, Red, honey,\\
115 - I, I don't think that
you're really mad at Marty.\\
116 - I think you are
just going through\\
117 - one of the five stages
of dealing with death.\\
118 - What are you talking about?\\
119 - There are five stages.\\
120 - Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance.\\
121 - Kitty, I've got two stages.\\
122 - Anger and drinking.\\
123 - Eric, I don't care what you
said to your grandmother,\\
124 - you did not kill her.\\
125 - I did, Donna. I killed her.\\
126 - She was old and the
shock of her grandson\\
127 - telling her that she
was nasty killed her.\\
128 - Have you talked to
Red about this?\\
129 - I'm not talking to
my dad about this.\\
130 - Do you remember how
angry he got when I\\
131 - didn't rake the yard?
And this is, like,\\
132 - twice as bad.\\
133 - Well... I don't
really want to talk about this anymore.\\
134 - Eric, you need
to talk about this.\\
135 - Donna, we don't talk about
things in the Forman family.\\
136 - It's not like your house,
where every time\\
137 - you have a "feeling", your dad\\
138 - gives you a big hug
and a gold star.\\
139 - - I'm just trying
to help you here.
- Well, I don't...\\
140 - Talking isn't
gonna help me, okay?\\
141 - What's gonna help me is,
like, drinking.\\
142 - Well, now you're just
being stupid.\\
143 - Hey, Forman,
let's go get wasted.\\
144 - Oh. Great.\\
145 - See? Hyde's a real friend.\\
146 - He's gonna help me get through
my grandma's death.\\
147 - Your grandma's dead?\\
148 - Oh, man, um...\\
149 - let's go get wasted.\\
150 - Wow. Yeah...\\
151 - As fellow human beings,
not brothers...\\
152 - human beings, how do you feel?\\
153 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
154 - I got away from this family.
I'm not afraid of my feelings.\\
155 - Well, I am.\\
156 - Okay, now, who would
like a Monte Cristo?\\
157 - Oh, Kitty, groovy sandwiches.\\
158 - No red meat, right?\\
159 - Oh, no. Just ham.\\
160 - You know, Marty,
we really should\\
161 - talk about Ma's funeral.\\
162 - Oh. Don't worry. It's on me.\\
163 - It's not a round of beers.
We'll split the cost.\\
164 - Sweet Red.\\
165 - So generous.\\
166 - Even when you're low on funds.\\
167 - I just want what's best for Mom.\\
168 - Yeah, Marty, that's...
that's what we all want.\\
169 - It's just that
when I feel bad...\\
170 - I don't cry like a little girl.\\
171 - Waitress!\\
172 - Waitress!\\
173 - Forman, relax, okay?\\
174 - Hi.\\
175 - Uh, we're gonna need
a pitcher and\\
176 - four glasses, please.\\
177 - I'm gonna need to see some ID.\\
178 - Of course.
I have mine right here\\
179 - but the rest of the fellas
left theirs\\
180 - back at the military base.\\
181 - Yeah.\\
182 - Gotcha.\\
183 - Uh, so, you're in the military.\\
184 - What base are you from?\\
185 - It's a secret military base.\\
186 - I'm Charlotte, and this is
my sister, Charlene.\\
187 - Hi, I'm... Ted.\\
188 - Sgt. Shaft.\\
189 - You can call me Honcho.\\
190 - I am Eric Forman.\\
191 - Oh, uh, Sally,
put that on our tab.\\
192 - And bring everybody
a round of shots.\\
193 - What is going on?\\
194 - They're picking us up.\\
195 - Ay, no!\\
196 - No, it's a good thing.\\
197 - Oh, okay.\\
198 - Excuse me, fellas,
but we need to\\
199 - talk to the ladies.\\
200 - Yeah, well, these ladies
are with us, okay?\\
201 - Well, they came here
with us, okay? Great.\\
202 - Get lost. They are trying
to pick us up.\\
203 - I think you've had quite
enough firewater there, chief.\\
204 - Hey, you mess with Eric Forman
and you mess with me.\\
205 - Are you looking for trouble?\\
206 - Oh, yes.\\
207 - Oh, I'm looking for trouble.\\
208 - Anybody else? Eh?\\
209 - Well, there's three of us,
so yeah.\\
210 - So, where were we?\\
211 - Oh, yes.
You were picking me up.\\
212 - Well, now, where is Eric?\\
213 - It's 2:00 a.m.
I'm worried sick.\\
214 - Eric is acting out.\\
215 - He doesn't have
the emotional tools\\
216 - to deal with this tragedy.\\
217 - You're an emotional tool, Marty.\\
218 - Now, who would
like lemon bundt cake?\\
219 - Where the hell
have you been?\\
220 - Um, I went to a bar.\\
221 - Eric, have you been drinking?\\
222 - No. I've been fighting.\\
223 - Oh, my Lord.\\
224 - Eric, it's okay.\\
225 - Just let the feelings out.\\
226 - Put them back in there, Eric.\\
227 - You know,
when a father and son...\\
228 - Marty, you are this close
to a headlock.\\
229 - Goodnight.\\
230 - Eric, just because\\
231 - there has been
a tragedy in the family\\
232 - it's no reason to act crazy.\\
233 - My son getting in a bar fight\\
234 - like... like, some
kind of bar-fighter.\\
235 - Kitty, stop cooking...\\
236 - and go to bed.\\
237 - Okay, all right.\\
238 - When the timer goes off...\\
239 - one of you better take that
roast out of the oven\\
240 - or there will be hell to pay.\\
241 - Sit down, Eric.\\
242 - Don't drink that,
put it on your eye.\\
243 - Come on, I'm kidding.\\
244 - So... this is beer.\\
245 - And as much as we
all miss Bernice\\
246 - we must remember that she is
now in a far better place.\\
247 - You don't have to die
to get to a better place, man.\\
248 - Just drive 50 miles
in any direction.\\
249 - Shut up, Hyde.\\
250 - Are you okay?\\
251 - I don't know, Michael.\\
252 - It's just that death
is so unexpected.\\
253 - And we are such fragile beings,\\
254 - never knowing when
the flame of our lives\\
255 - will be blown out
by the wind of death.\\
256 - What?\\
257 - I am so turned on, aren't you?\\
258 - Okay. Car?
Let's go.\\
259 - Coat room.
Better.\\
260 - Um...\\
261 - I know we had our differences.\\
262 - Uh, I married Red\\
263 - and, and you hated me.\\
264 - Um, well, uh,
just try to be nicer to God.\\
265 - Life
is so complicated.\\
266 - You get old and die.\\
267 - Thank God I'm
still young and hot.\\
268 - Man, I can't believe\\
269 - they're just gonna
throw that ring away.\\
270 - Ah! No. I can't.\\
271 - Oh, my God,
there is a body in here.\\
272 - Well, Ma...\\
273 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
274 - Oh, sorry,
those should be closed.\\
275 - Hey. Oh, God,\\
276 - you got a black eye.\\
277 - It looks pretty hot.\\
278 - Well, you should
see the other guy.\\
279 - Did you really lay him out?\\
280 - No, I mean, he was huge.\\
281 - I mean, you should just...
you should have seen him.\\
282 - The fact that
I even took the punch\\
283 - is a testament to
how tough I really am.\\
284 - Ow.
Ooh, sorry.\\
285 - No...\\
286 - Look, Donna, I'm sorry...\\
287 - about the other night.
I was acting crazy and, um...\\
288 - And I'm completely over it now.\\
289 - I mean, you just... you can't
dwell on these things.\\
290 - So you had
a heart-to-heart with Red?\\
291 - Hell, no.\\
292 - So you're still just
suppressing everything.\\
293 - - Sure beats dealing
with it now, right?
- Yeah.\\
294 - Hug?\\
295 - I'm really sorry your mom died.\\
296 - It's, like, sad and stuff.\\
297 - Hey.\\
298 - Pretty great funeral, huh?\\
299 - Red, I'm sorry
about your mom, man.\\
300 - And I'm sorry Kelso's an idiot.\\
301 - Mr. Red, always remember...\\
302 - a mother's goodness is
carried down forever by her sons.\\
303 - Have you met my sister, Marty?\\
304 - Hey, what's all this stuff?\\
305 - Cameras.\\
306 - My dad was
an amateur photographer.\\
307 - Had his own darkroom.\\
308 - Really?\\
309 - Hey, Forman, you have any naked\\
310 - pictures of your grandma?\\
311 - No!\\
312 - You do now.\\
313 - Hey! My old train set.\\
314 - Your train set?\\
315 - That was our train set.\\
316 - Well, really,
it should have been mine.\\
317 - You never played with it, right?\\
318 - Red...\\
319 - do you want to keep the trains?\\
320 - If you don't want them.\\
321 - It's not about me.\\
322 - It's about what you want.\\
323 - Make an honest
declaration of your needs.\\
324 - Would you cut the crap?\\
325 - Just say to me,
"Marty, I want the trains."\\
326 - Marty...\\
327 - I'd be glad to hang
on to them for you.\\
328 - Are you asking me for them?\\
329 - No!\\
330 - Fine. Then I'll keep them.\\
331 - Fine. Go ahead and keep them.
I don't want the damn things.\\
332 - Kitty, you go in there\\
333 - and tell that bastard
to give me my trains.\\
334 - Red, it's your problem.\\
335 - I gotta make a pie.\\
336 - Oh, well, now see.\\
337 - Marty left you the trains.\\
338 - Yeah, he did.\\
339 - And he even set it up right.\\
340 - - See, the stations
are all spread out.
- Uh-huh.\\
341 - Five stops, five times the fun.\\
342 - But if he thinks he's playing
with them when he visits\\
343 - he's got another think coming.\\
344 - Now, Red, you have to share
with your brother.\\
345 - I don't wanna.\\
346 - Okay.\\
347 - I am gonna go
make a coffee cake.\\
348 - Hey, Dad, nice trains.\\
349 - Yeah.\\
350 - You know, I can't believe...\\
351 - that your grandma held
on to them all these years.\\
352 - I thought she'd
thrown them away.\\
353 - Yeah, she was
a good egg, Grandma.\\
354 - Yes, she was.\\
355 - You know,
when I was a little boy,\\
356 - I hated peaches
and Mom knew that.\\
357 - So, uh, whenever she
made a peach pie...\\
358 - she'd make
a little blueberry pie.\\
359 - Special, just for me.\\
360 - You know, she was
the first one to call me Red.\\
361 - And the last time I saw her...\\
362 - I didn't...\\
363 - I didn't say, I love you...\\
364 - I didn't even say good bye.\\
365 - I said,
"Show me the tail lights."\\
366 - Dad, um...\\
367 - the last thing I
said to her was,\\
368 - "It wouldn't kill
you to be nice."\\
369 - But I think it did,
because she died.\\
370 - That could only
happen to you, son.\\
371 - It's okay.\\
372 - I know.\\
373 - What's the matter, Kitty?\\
374 - I'm all out of eggs...\\
375 - and flour.\\
376 - Come here.\\
377 - Eric, come here.\\
378 - Hey, do you think these
diamonds are real?\\
379 - Oh. Family moment.
I'll leave you three alone.\\
380 - I'm just gonna wait over here.\\
381 - I'm really sorry that our last
conversation didn't go so smooth.\\
382 - But, um, look, that is not
how I feel about you at all.\\
383 - Then why did you\\
384 - kill me, Eric?\\
385 - I'll never forgive you.\\
386 - What the hell are
you doing out here?\\
387 - Freezing my nads
off for a joke, man.
\subsection {Episode 24: Hyde Moves In}
1 - Guys, can we do
something besides cruise?\\
2 - It's the third time tonight
we've driven by that house.\\
3 - You know what we could do?\\
4 - We could go skinny-dipping...\\
5 - Naked!\\
6 - That's the way God intended.\\
7 - No way!\\
8 - Why not?
It'd be fun.\\
9 - Well, sure,
it's fun for you guys,\\
10 - 'cause you get to look
at us, and that's a treat.\\
11 - But we just get to look
at you, and that's nasty.\\
12 - So, you don't wanna do it?\\
13 - I don't care.
I'll do it.\\
14 - Mmm.\\
15 - Okay, I'm in.\\
16 - Naked is dirty.\\
17 - Dirty, dirty,
dirty\\
18 - Dirty, dirty,
dirty\\
19 - Dirty, dirty, dirty\\
20 - Dirty, dirty, dirty
dirty, dirty, dirty\\
21 - Oh, this was such
a great idea, Michael.\\
22 - This was so much fun.\\
23 - Oh, wait.\\
24 - Except for the part where
our clothes got stolen, you idiot.\\
25 - By the way, Fez,
nice tattoo, man.\\
26 - Thank you.\\
27 - It is the blessed virgin
of Yorba Linda.\\
28 - Did you want to see her dance?\\
29 - No!\\
30 - Look, guys, we need a plan.\\
31 - I'm about to drive
up to the house\\
32 - with a car full of naked people.\\
33 - They hate you guys
when you're dressed.\\
34 - We can go to my house.\\
35 - Yeah, your mom is used to
having naked guys around.\\
36 - She's not even home, you moron.\\
37 - Ow, ow, ow.\\
38 - Put on the Top 40.\\
39 - Whoa!
Sit down, Fez.\\
40 - I see London.
I see besticle.\\
41 - Well, what do you
want me to do about it?\\
42 - Tuck it in.\\
43 - Hangin' out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - Whoa, yeah\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - Pork chops?\\
52 - I thought we agreed
to stick to a budget.\\
53 - Pork chops aren't cheap.\\
54 - Well, you know, on
the way to the market,\\
55 - I tried to run over a cat.\\
56 - But they are
just so darn speedy.\\
57 - Kitty...\\
58 - The plant's
gonna be closing soon.\\
59 - I mean, we have
to watch our money.\\
60 - Well, maybe I could
put you on the sugar diet.\\
61 - That'd save money.\\
62 - Sugar diet?\\
63 - Sweet, huh?\\
64 - See, that's perfect.\\
65 - Give me another spoonful.\\
66 - Tasty and cheap.\\
67 - Now, when I say cheap...\\
68 - I mean, you know. Not...\\
69 - Shut up.\\
70 - So this is your home?\\
71 - Yep.\\
72 - Oh, this explains
a lot of your behavior.\\
73 - Come on, man.
This place is great.\\
74 - It's better than
Forman's basement.\\
75 - That's a color TV, and I
just got new vice grips.\\
76 - Now we can watch
any channel we want.\\
77 - Hyde, your mom really just
ran off with some trucker?\\
78 - No, Forman, I made it up\\
79 - because it sounds so classy.\\
80 - Why would she just run
off with some trucker?\\
81 - It's springtime.\\
82 - Love is in the air, man.\\
83 - Right. And she just
left you here alone?\\
84 - I realize this is hard for you\\
85 - to get your head around, Opie,\\
86 - but you're failing to
see the upside here.\\
87 - We've got food, we've got beer,\\
88 - we have zero adult supervision.\\
89 - Welcome to Camp Naughty-Bad-Fun.\\
90 - Jackie, you
couldn't find anything?\\
91 - No offense, Hyde,\\
92 - but all your mother's
clothes are whorey.\\
93 - What?\\
94 - Oh, but they look
great on you, Donna.\\
95 - Thanks, Jackie.\\
96 - Michael, can you
please take me home?\\
97 - Look, I think I caught
something at the reservoir.\\
98 - Like an eel?\\
99 - Not that, you idiot.\\
100 - I think I'm sick.\\
101 - Oh, I caught an eel.\\
102 - But, Midge, why do
you have to have\\
103 - your Woman Warrior
meetings here every week?\\
104 - Because none of the
other feminists' husbands\\
105 - will let them.\\
106 - Boy, those bastards.\\
107 - I know!\\
108 - Bob, these meetings have
really opened my eyes.\\
109 - For example,
the English language\\
110 - is so oppressive to women.\\
111 - I mean, why is it mailman
and not mailwoman?\\
112 - Why do they even
call the mail mail?\\
113 - Why not call it femail?\\
114 - Yes. You see, Bob,
now you're thinking.\\
115 - No, I'm not.
I'm just being funny\\
116 - because it's stupid.\\
117 - Okay.\\
118 - Then that's why you're
part of the problem.\\
119 - My wife is a maniac.\\
120 - Oh, I'm sorry.
A wo-maniac.\\
121 - Oh, oh, I'm sorry.\\
122 - I didn't know anyone
else was in here.\\
123 - You must be Midge's husband.\\
124 - I guess.\\
125 - She's a real gung-ho
woman warrior.\\
126 - You must be very proud.\\
127 - I guess.\\
128 - Well, call me old-fashioned,\\
129 - but when I see you sitting
there eating a sandwich,\\
130 - it makes me darn tootin' mad.\\
131 - I mean, I think a married man\\
132 - who provides for his family\\
133 - deserves to come
home to a hot meal.\\
134 - You're neat.\\
135 - Eric, I thought I told
you to wash up for dinner.\\
136 - I know, it's difficult to hear\\
137 - with your head up your ass.\\
138 - Get a move on.\\
139 - Oh, Red...\\
140 - You need to relax.\\
141 - Anger is bad for the soul.\\
142 - It's Fez, right?
Yes.\\
143 - Get out.
Okay.\\
144 - Come on.
Wash up.\\
145 - Hey, Dad,
um...\\
146 - Can I talk to you for a second?\\
147 - Um...\\
148 - Do you think that Hyde
could stay for dinner?\\
149 - Eric, again?\\
150 - I can't afford
to feed your friends.\\
151 - I can't even afford to feed you,\\
152 - but the law requires me to.\\
153 - Look, his mom's out of town.\\
154 - All right.\\
155 - But you have to
fill up on bread.\\
156 - And the two of you
are splitting a pork chop.\\
157 - Thanks, man.\\
158 - Ah, no problem.\\
159 - So, you do know you're not
getting any of that pork chop, right?\\
160 - Is that so?\\
161 - Michael, go away.
I'm sick.\\
162 - I don't have any makeup on.\\
163 - My hair's a mess.
And I look hideous.\\
164 - Jackie, come on, I don't
care what you look like.\\
165 - I just want to see you.\\
166 - Why?\\
167 - Well, 'cause you're
my girlfriend.\\
168 - And I got you a
present.\\
169 - Oh.\\
170 - Michael, that is so sweet.\\
171 - Oh, it's the sweetest
thing ever.\\
172 - Let me hold it.\\
173 - Oh.\\
174 - Thank you,\\
175 - Lover.\\
176 - Mom, Mom, Mom?\\
177 - Yeah, I couldn't help but
notice that you're not home yet.\\
178 - Oh, is that right?\\
179 - Okay, great. Yeah.\\
180 - No, no, no, you know.\\
181 - Whatever makes you happy.\\
182 - Hey, Forman.
Hi.\\
183 - Come on in.
Make yourself at home.\\
184 - I'm out of beer,\\
185 - but if you want,
you can break something.\\
186 - Actually, I had my eye
on the phone, so...\\
187 - Hey, what's that?\\
188 - Its crackers with
ketchup on top for, uh...\\
189 - You know, for zest.\\
190 - Okay. Well,
I'm just gonna guess\\
191 - that Edna's not coming back.\\
192 - No, man. She's just
been delayed a little bit.\\
193 - Oh, okay.\\
194 - Oh, okay. Didn't there
used to be a TV there?\\
195 - Yeah. I pawned it.\\
196 - You pawned your mom's TV?\\
197 - Hyde, she's not coming back.\\
198 - Okay, she's not
coming back. All right?\\
199 - So, what are...
What are you gonna do?\\
200 - Sell the house.\\
201 - You rent.\\
202 - I guess I'm in more trouble
than I thought.\\
203 - No, Hyde...\\
204 - No, Hyde, I'm serious here!\\
205 - You need help, my friend.\\
206 - You would need help.\\
207 - I'll be fine.\\
208 - Cool, I brought you
this sandwich.\\
209 - Fine. I'll take
your sandwich.\\
210 - After this, no more help.\\
211 - Hyde's mom is gone,
and he is going downhill.\\
212 - I mean, he's sitting
over there in the dark\\
213 - eating ketchup off crackers.\\
214 - I ate gum off
a parking meter once.\\
215 - But it was on a dare.\\
216 - I made a dollar.\\
217 - Man, there's some
suckers out there.\\
218 - Huh?\\
219 - Crackers and ketchup
are "K" words,\\
220 - which makes them
naturally funny.\\
221 - Oh, my God,\\
222 - I can feel, like, all the
molecules in my body.\\
223 - I'm gonna count them.\\
224 - One, two, three...\\
225 - You guys disgust me.\\
226 - Doesn't anyone care about Hyde?\\
227 - Oh, my God.
Run, Scooby. Now. Run.\\
228 - You know what's freaking me out?\\
229 - I saw Jackie sick,
without makeup.\\
230 - It was like the freakiest
thing I've ever seen\\
231 - in my entire, entire life,\\
232 - including the class trip
to the sausage factory.\\
233 - Ugh, if I never see the
inside of another cow,\\
234 - it will be too soon.\\
235 - Jerky?\\
236 - 18, 19...\\
237 - I have the biggest hands
in the world!\\
238 - Damn it. One, two...\\
239 - So his mom's gone, and I
know he doesn't want any help.\\
240 - But the Donner party
didn't get any help,\\
241 - and then, I mean,
they ate each other, so...\\
242 - Hey, don't bogart that jerky.\\
243 - Yeah, no parents would
be cool.\\
244 - Like the Lord of the Flies.\\
245 - Kelso, did you ever
finish Lord of the Flies?\\
246 - No.\\
247 - So?\\
248 - Nothing.\\
249 - Look, what are we
gonna do about Hyde?\\
250 - I think we should tell someone.\\
251 - What am I gonna do about Jackie?\\
252 - I can't even look at her.\\
253 - She's unpleasant
when she's healthy,\\
254 - so I can only imagine
how she looks like that.\\
255 - Hey, Kelso, Jackie's...\\
256 - Jackie's my friend,\\
257 - and you're shallow,
and pathetic.\\
258 - And you know what else?\\
259 - My hands are huge!\\
260 - They're like boxing gloves.\\
261 - I am the greatest.\\
262 - Okay, champ, whatever you...\\
263 - Oh, hello, Bob.\\
264 - Sharon?\\
265 - Baloney?\\
266 - Bob, what are you doing?\\
267 - Nothing.
We were just talking.\\
268 - These Jordan almonds
are for the feminists.\\
269 - Oh, yeah. Sorry.\\
270 - Come on, Sharon. I saved
you a seat on the Ottoman.\\
271 - Oh, I mean otto-woman!\\
272 - I'm sick of baloney.\\
273 - I want a new sandwich.\\
274 - Oh, Eric, I'm sure she's
not abandoning Steven.\\
275 - She's his mother.\\
276 - Mom, her exact words were,\\
277 - "I know I'm your mother,\\
278 - "but I'm abandoning
you, Steven."\\
279 - Well, that doesn't
sound very good.\\
280 - No, siree.
Red?\\
281 - Look, Eric,\\
282 - you know I'd love
to help Steven.\\
283 - I'm a giver...\\
284 - But you can't squeeze
blood from a stone, son.\\
285 - Well, you know, we could...\\
286 - We could just pop over
there just to check up on him.\\
287 - No, I'm not going
over there. That's final.\\
288 - I am not Santa Claus.\\
289 - Well, thank God you're
not Santa Claus, Red.\\
290 - You scare the hell
out of children.\\
291 - Go away, Michael.\\
292 - Jackie, please?\\
293 - I really need to talk to you.\\
294 - I want to apologize\\
295 - for screaming when I
looked at you the other day.\\
296 - It's just...\\
297 - You looked really gross.\\
298 - But I've been doing
a lot of thinking.\\
299 - And... And I
realized something.\\
300 - I realized that just
because you look bad now,\\
301 - that doesn't mean you're
gonna look bad forever.\\
302 - I mean, I just saw
your mom downstairs,\\
303 - and even though she's
pretty old, she's really hot!\\
304 - And that gives me
hope for the future.\\
305 - Oh, Michael.\\
306 - Let me finish.\\
307 - I guess what I'm
trying to say is...\\
308 - That I realize that
this whole mess,\\
309 - that's just a temporary thing.\\
310 - But physical beauty,
that lasts forever.\\
311 - Oh, that is so true.\\
312 - Ooh. Later, baby.\\
313 - Later.\\
314 - Right.\\
315 - Right.\\
316 - And I tell 'em I could
sell 'em the cheaper one,\\
317 - but it'll wind up costing
'em more in the long run.\\
318 - Which is a
mathematical impossibility,\\
319 - but, uh, they buy it anyway.\\
320 - I just love a man who's
passionate about his work.\\
321 - Oh, come here.\\
322 - You've got a little
something right there.\\
323 - Oh, Donna.
This is Sharon.\\
324 - She's part of your mom's
feminist group.\\
325 - She hates men, too.\\
326 - Well, I should be getting
back to the meeting.\\
327 - Why you all dressed up?\\
328 - I'm not dressed up.
This is California casual.\\
329 - There's nothing going on here.\\
330 - Everything is fine
between your mother and me.\\
331 - Okay.\\
332 - Look, Donna, can't a
man have a conversation\\
333 - with an attentive woman
without getting the third degree?\\
334 - Sure, Dad.\\
335 - All right.\\
336 - Apology accepted.\\
337 - Now be a good girl
and sneak in there\\
338 - and get Daddy some
of those Jordan almonds.\\
339 - Well, no, Dad.
Those are for the feminists.\\
340 - Oh, God, they got to her, too.\\
341 - You, um...\\
342 - You need a coffee table.\\
343 - Yeah, that'd really
pull the room together.\\
344 - Steven, I was... I was gonna
clean your kitchen for you,\\
345 - but, um, frankly...\\
346 - I'm afraid.\\
347 - Well, looks like he's got
everything under control.\\
348 - Kitty, I'll be in the car.\\
349 - Red.\\
350 - Steven, why don't you go to your
room and gather some clothes,\\
351 - and I'll do a load of wash
for you at our house.\\
352 - Cool.\\
353 - Well, we can't let him
live like this.\\
354 - Kitty, he'll be fine.\\
355 - I mean, compared to Korea,\\
356 - this place is Shangri-La
wrapped in happy fun candy.\\
357 - You know I'd like to help him.\\
358 - We don't have the money.\\
359 - Well, I suppose we could
call social services.\\
360 - Yeah. See, now,
that's sensible.\\
361 - Yeah, they'll know
what to do. Yes.\\
362 - After all, they take
thousands of cases every year.\\
363 - So many, in fact, that they have
to house them in gymnasiums...\\
364 - Kitty.\\
365 - With no heat.\\
366 - Damn it.\\
367 - I am tired of being
Santa Claus.\\
368 - Steven, you get your
together\\
369 - and you get your ass in
the damn car.\\
370 - We're going.\\
371 - Now, damn it!\\
372 - Okay.\\
373 - You are just
the sweetest man alive.\\
374 - You know, Red really
yelled at me, Forman.\\
375 - Yeah. Um,
get used to that.\\
376 - This blows, man.\\
377 - When I was living at home,\\
378 - I didn't have to
answer to anybody.\\
379 - I made my own rules.\\
380 - You screwed me, Forman.\\
381 - I told you this is
none of your business.\\
382 - Steven, Eric,\\
383 - here's your cocoa.\\
384 - Thanks, Mrs. Forman.\\
385 - Thanks, Mom.\\
386 - You're lucky
I don't kick your ass.\\
387 - Are you gonna eat your cookies?\\
388 - Oh, that's it.
I gotta get a tattoo.\\
389 - Please don't.\\
390 - That's incredible!\\
391 - But disgusting.\\
392 - That...\\
393 - That's incredible
and disgusting.\\
394 - Do you wanna see her
pick up a dime?\\
395 - No!\\
396 - - How about a quarter?
- No!
\subsection {Episode 25: The Good Son}
1 - Wow. Thanks, Mrs. Forman.\\
2 - You know, we never had waffles
at my house.\\
3 - My mom always said
a waffle iron was a luxury.\\
4 - Like, um, pillow cases
or not getting hit.\\
5 - Man, this is so cool.\\
6 - Well, you are welcome, Steven.\\
7 - See, Eric,
I told you I was cool.\\
8 - Eric, did you tell your mother
that she's not cool?\\
9 - - What? Well, I mean...
- Stop telling your
mother she's not cool.\\
10 - Fine. Mom, you're super fly.\\
11 - Thanks, honey.\\
12 - Steven, would you like\\
13 - maple syrup or blueberry syrup?\\
14 - You have syrup?
Oh...\\
15 - Man, I love it here.\\
16 - And we love
having you here, man.\\
17 - You're like
the brother I never had.\\
18 - I mean, I have a sister,
but I hate her.\\
19 - So, this is great.\\
20 - Eric, after breakfast
I want you to rake the yard.\\
21 - Rake? But, Dad, I was gonna...\\
22 - I'll do it.\\
23 - Okay, Steven.\\
24 - Oh, my God...\\
25 - I love my new brother!\\
26 - Hanging out\\
27 - Down the street\\
28 - The same old thing\\
29 - We did last week\\
30 - Not a thing to do\\
31 - But talk to you\\
32 - Whoa, yeah\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - Hey, Kitty, look
who's back in town.\\
35 - Oh, my God...\\
36 - Oh!\\
37 - Bull MacCrakin.
I thought you were in Chicago.\\
38 - Nope. I came back
to Point Place\\
39 - to steal you away
from this old S-O-B.\\
40 - Hey, Bull, you still, uh...
You with Wendy?\\
41 - Oh, no, no, no, I got married.\\
42 - Wendy was a couple
dozen ladies ago.\\
43 - Well, now, boy,
that is a lot of ladies.\\
44 - Hey...\\
45 - You remember when our
destroyer got strafed...\\
46 - ...and you got four chunks\\
47 - of hot shrapnel
right in the knee?\\
48 - Five. I still limp
when it rains.\\
49 - Yeah... great times.\\
50 - The greatest.\\
51 - It is popping.\\
52 - Help me.
It is popping in my mouth.\\
53 - Fez, they're Pop Rocks, okay?\\
54 - That's what they do. They pop.\\
55 - Hey, Jackie, you know
what would be cool to do\\
56 - with these in your mouth?\\
57 - Oh, hey, Donna, look,
everyone's here.\\
58 - And I thought we'd be all alone.\\
59 - Phew.\\
60 - Oh, I get it.\\
61 - They want to make out.\\
62 - Psst. For her pleasure.\\
63 - Well, if I cannot
watch them make out,\\
64 - can I watch you two make out?\\
65 - Yeah, sure.
Michael!\\
66 - Uh, I mean, no, Fez.\\
67 - I don't know about you but...\\
68 - McHale's Navy
makes me feel extra sexy.\\
69 - Whatever.\\
70 - Hey, take it outside.
I've got to do my\\
71 - homework here, Frenchie.\\
72 - Good one.\\
73 - Now get out.\\
74 - No, I'm serious, man. Your
mom just found out I failed a test.\\
75 - Did she yell at you?\\
76 - No.\\
77 - But she said she was
really disappointed.\\
78 - And then, before I
knew what I was doing,\\
79 - I told her I'd try harder.\\
80 - No.\\
81 - Yeah.\\
82 - Oh, Okay. Now, here...\\
83 - I brought you a sandwich
to help you study.\\
84 - Thanks, Mrs. Forman.
Mmm-hmm.\\
85 - Eric, Steven is studying.
Don't bother him.\\
86 - Why don't you and Donna
go up to your bedroom?\\
87 - Okay.\\
88 - I mean, no, no. Bad idea.\\
89 - Just go outside to a,
a well-lit supervised area\\
90 - and talk politely
like decent young adults.\\
91 - Gee, whizz,
that sounds super, Mom.\\
92 - Here's a crazy idea.\\
93 - Why don't you
do the dishes, Bob?\\
94 - Why don't I do
the dishes? I work all day.\\
95 - I meditate all day.\\
96 - Why don't you meditate
over the sink and wash the dishes?\\
97 - Donna, will you tell
your father he's a jackass?\\
98 - Donna, your mother was fine\\
99 - until she met those feminists\\
100 - and started thinking.\\
101 - Well, excuse me, Bob.
But I'm not happy!\\
102 - Really? Really?
Well, I'm ecstatic!\\
103 - You better watch out, Eric.\\
104 - 'Cause it's all fun when you're\\
105 - making out on the couch\\
106 - but then they get
bigger and bitchier!\\
107 - Uh, no offense, honey.\\
108 - You're not gonna
get bitchier, are you?\\
109 - Shut up.\\
110 - Oh, no.\\
111 - Well, Bull, I can't believe
you finally\\
112 - settled down with a nice girl.\\
113 - Oh, well, he may have
settled down all right,\\
114 - but I'm not that nice.\\
115 - You know, Red,
I noticed in the paper\\
116 - that your plant's closing down.\\
117 - Yeah, you can't compete
with those damn foreign cars.\\
118 - I tell you,
if I'd seen this coming,\\
119 - I'd have shot a little
straighter during the war.\\
120 - You know...\\
121 - I'm opening
another hot tub store\\
122 - right here in Point Place.\\
123 - And, I'm telling you pal, you've
always got a job with me if you want it.\\
124 - I don't know, though, Bull.\\
125 - You know, uh...\\
126 - this thing's pretty hot.\\
127 - That jet just hit me
right in the keister.\\
128 - Yeah, believe it or not,
some people like that.\\
129 - Wanna ease back
on the hooch there, Kitty?\\
130 - You're getting a little loose.\\
131 - Oh, I am just...
I'm just happy.\\
132 - It's like... It's like a bath.\\
133 - Only it's outside.\\
134 - It's fun!\\
135 - You got a real nice setup here.\\
136 - I sure do like
that Corvette of yours.\\
137 - Oh, yeah, I baby that thing.\\
138 - You remember when we
got back from Korea,\\
139 - we were both gonna buy them?\\
140 - Yeah.\\
141 - I never did get that Corvette.
Got two kids instead.\\
142 - Kids. That's great.\\
143 - Yeah.\\
144 - I sure did want that Corvette.\\
145 - Okay, you're done cleaning
the garage. Let's play some ball.\\
146 - Hang on, man.
I gotta take out the trash.\\
147 - You know, Hyde,
seeing you work hard\\
148 - and take pride in what you do...\\
149 - I lost a lot of
respect for you, man.\\
150 - You used to be my hero.\\
151 - My lazy American hero.\\
152 - Don't listen to them, Hyde.
I think it's great\\
153 - you're doing all my chores.\\
154 - Whoa, Eric,
great job on the garage.\\
155 - Thanks.\\
156 - Hyde did it.\\
157 - Yeah, well, I should have known.\\
158 - It's actually clean.\\
159 - Nice going.
Thanks, Red.\\
160 - What did you do?\\
161 - I...\\
162 - love you.\\
163 - Well, I love you, too.\\
164 - Dinner, kids.\\
165 - Okay, now,
that was Bull on the phone\\
166 - and he has invited us to a party\\
167 - on Saturday night.\\
168 - Yeah?\\
169 - What's wrong?\\
170 - Well, it's just that...\\
171 - I look at what Bull has and
I look at what I have and...\\
172 - I wonder if I made
a few wrong turns, Kitty.\\
173 - Well, maybe
you'll get a fresh start\\
174 - working for Bull.\\
175 - Yeah.\\
176 - - I mean,
I fought for my country.
- Mmm-hmm.\\
177 - I deserve a Corvette.\\
178 - Okay, here we all are. Mmm.\\
179 - So, honey, how did you do
on your history paper?\\
180 - Oh, well...
History not being...\\
181 - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\\
182 - I was talking to Steven.\\
183 - Well, I must say, all that
studying really paid off.\\
184 - Oh, yeah?
What did you get a "D"?\\
185 - No.\\
186 - A "C" minus.\\
187 - Way to go.\\
188 - I got a "B."\\
189 - You couldn't get an "A"?\\
190 - Oh, honey,
don't listen to your father.\\
191 - You did super.\\
192 - And, Steven,
you did super-duper.\\
193 - Why does he get a "duper"?\\
194 - Because we expect more from you.\\
195 - Give me a break, Forman.
I don't have a mommy.\\
196 - Don't sweat it, Eric.\\
197 - You can only be as
smart as God made you.\\
198 - Or didn't.\\
199 - All right, Laurie, didn't you
just flunk out of college?\\
200 - Hey, get bent, twerp.
Wear a bra!\\
201 - Can we please not fight?\\
202 - "Can we please not fight?"\\
203 - Can you please not suck?\\
204 - Good one, Eric.
Thank you.\\
205 - All right, everybody shut up.\\
206 - Now, we're gonna
have a nice dinner.\\
207 - And Eric, you try to
be more like Steven.\\
208 - Where's Hyde?\\
209 - Mom and Dad are
giving him a bath.\\
210 - No, really.\\
211 - I don't know, who cares.
Shut up.\\
212 - I'm watching TV. I hate you.\\
213 - You're just jealous, right?
Because\\
214 - you're not number one anymore.\\
215 - Well, if I'm not number one,
guess who's number three?\\
216 - So
your parents have brought\\
217 - a new bundle of joy\\
218 - into your home.\\
219 - And you might feel like your
parents don't love you anymore.\\
220 - But that's not true.\\
221 - They simply love you less.\\
222 - You see, your parents only
have so much love to go around.\\
223 - Here's how your parents' love was
distributed before the new arrival.\\
224 - And here it is after.\\
225 - But what can you do about it?\\
226 - Well, you could run away.\\
227 - Ho-ho! As if they'd come
and look for you.\\
228 - Say, here's something
you can do.\\
229 - Think of all the good times
you've had with your family.\\
230 - Because they're all over now.\\
231 - Okay, here we go.
Scotch rocks.\\
232 - Scotch rocks.
And a mango margarita.\\
233 - He was in the National Guard.\\
234 - Oh.\\
235 - Oh, you know, I almost forgot.\\
236 - I'm gonna need your car keys.\\
237 - How drunk do you
think I'm gonna get, huh?\\
238 - Hopefully, drunk enough.\\
239 - My wife's got my keys.\\
240 - You know, Bull, if you
were serious, I'll take that job.\\
241 - You got it.
It'll be just like old times.\\
242 - I mean, except for the
killing.\\
243 - Midge, I need my keys.\\
244 - Sharon, hi.\\
245 - Honey, you remember Sharon.\\
246 - Uh, no.\\
247 - Sharon, is it?\\
248 - You are so funny. How do
you keep your hands off him?\\
249 - I don't know. I just do.\\
250 - So my parents are, like,
fighting all the time\\
251 - and they want me
to choose sides.\\
252 - But I can't because
they're both idiots.\\
253 - I don't know. I mean,
I really think\\
254 - they're gonna get a divorce.\\
255 - My God, Donna, I am so sorry.\\
256 - But you know what?
That very thing\\
257 - happened to a
good friend of mine...\\
258 - and now she has
twice as much stuff...\\
259 - and twice as much clothes.\\
260 - And her parents even fought over\\
261 - who got to buy her a car.\\
262 - I mean, you're right, Jackie.\\
263 - I mean, this divorce thing\\
264 - could actually work
to my advantage.\\
265 - Exactly.\\
266 - Yeah, I just have to
make it very clear\\
267 - that my love is contingent
on how much they buy me.\\
268 - Why am I even
talking to you about this?\\
269 - You have a great handle on it.\\
270 - Excuse me, um...\\
271 - Jackie, when exactly
did you lose your soul?\\
272 - Um...\\
273 - Cheerleading camp.\\
274 - You almost done there, Hazel?\\
275 - See, that's funny
'cause Hazel is a maid.\\
276 - Or you could have
called him Alice, too.\\
277 - Shut up, Fez.\\
278 - So, pretty tough with that
scrubber in your hand, huh?\\
279 - Yeah, I know. Hyde,\\
280 - Red and Kitty aren't even here.\\
281 - I mean,
you're kissing phantom butt.\\
282 - You know what, Forman?\\
283 - I used to think Red
was a real hard-ass, but,\\
284 - after doing your chores
for the last five days,\\
285 - I've come to the conclusion\\
286 - that you're just a
lazy, spoiled brat.\\
287 - Ooh!\\
288 - Hazel never talked like that.\\
289 - Hey.\\
290 - Hey, that's not fair. You've
been doing them for five days.\\
291 - Try 16 years, man.\\
292 - You know,
I guess I'm just grateful.\\
293 - Well, stop it.\\
294 - You're making me look bad.\\
295 - Plus you've become, like,
a total drag to hang out with.\\
296 - Hey, that ever happened
to the psychotic troublemaker\\
297 - we all know and love?\\
298 - Look, put down the dishes\\
299 - and start doing
something stupid and\\
300 - senseless right now.\\
301 - Forman, I'm a guest here.\\
302 - Then fine.\\
303 - I guess I will have
to do something stupid.\\
304 - Hey, hey.\\
305 - I know something
stupid we can do.\\
306 - You got a bowling ball?\\
307 - What?\\
308 - And they're arguing
and arguing and arguing.\\
309 - Okay...\\
310 - no offense, Donna...\\
311 - but all this talk about your
mom and dad fighting...\\
312 - well, it's boring me.\\
313 - Really? Well, talking about
your hair was fascinating.\\
314 - Hold it by the thumbhole.\\
315 - Okay, what are
those idiots doing?\\
316 - Something idiotic.\\
317 - Let's go find out.\\
318 - Don't be such a baby. We just
want to see how high it'll bounce.\\
319 - Nothing bad can happen.\\
320 - Okay. Forman, man, think.\\
321 - You are listening to Kelso.\\
322 - Don't do it.
Wait, wait, wait.\\
323 - Now you're
telling me what to do?\\
324 - Enough talk. Do it.\\
325 - Oh...\\
326 - See, I never even
thought of that.\\
327 - - Later.
- Thank you.\\
328 - - See you.
- Bye.\\
329 - Ah, maybe they won't notice.\\
330 - Okay, Kitty, it's your turn.
Pick a key.\\
331 - Oh, my gosh, there are so many,\\
332 - I can't tell
which ones are ours.\\
333 - Kitty, you don't pick your key\\
334 - because then you'd go home
with your own husband.\\
335 - And who wants that?\\
336 - Oh, I, um...\\
337 - Me?\\
338 - But the whole
point of a key party\\
339 - is to meet new and interesting
people and have sex with them.\\
340 - Oh, my God.\\
341 - You're swingers.\\
342 - Red, honey,
it's, it's time to leave.\\
343 - Now? I'm having a good time.\\
344 - Um, I left the iron on.
And the stove.\\
345 - I, I... I left the iron on,
on the stove\\
346 - which is also on.
And that... It can't be safe.\\
347 - Kitty, what's wrong with you?\\
348 - Oh, Red, look
whose keys I've got.\\
349 - Oh, dear Lord.\\
350 - You lucky bastard.\\
351 - Bite her earlobes,
she loves that.\\
352 - What the hell are
you talking about?\\
353 - Red, you do know that this is a\\
354 - wife-swapping party, right?\\
355 - What?\\
356 - Are you telling me you
want to sleep with my wife?\\
357 - No.\\
358 - I'll take a run at
any one of these ladies.\\
359 - What the hell's
wrong with my wife?\\
360 - Nothing, Red,
it's just done random\\
361 - so that it's fair. That's all.\\
362 - Jesus, Bull...\\
363 - I thought I knew you.\\
364 - You do. Red, I'm the same guy
who's got shrapnel in my...\\
365 - No, no.\\
366 - Good night.\\
367 - Come on, Bob.
They're swingers.\\
368 - Oh.\\
369 - Well, it took
a really weird hop.\\
370 - Why would you drop
a bowling ball on the couch?\\
371 - What good could come of it?\\
372 - - Well, Okay. Hindsight being...
- Eric.\\
373 - I don't want to hear
any more of your\\
374 - dumbass excuses.\\
375 - This is the most irresponsible,\\
376 - idiotic thing
you have ever done.\\
377 - Actually, Red, I did it.\\
378 - You?\\
379 - No, no, no. Dad,\\
380 - Hyde's just covering for me.
I did it.\\
381 - Hey, Forman, stop.\\
382 - Red, it was me.\\
383 - No. It was me.\\
384 - Well, guess what?
I don't care!\\
385 - You're both idiots.\\
386 - And if you have to get a job
digging ditches,\\
387 - you are gonna buy me a new TV.\\
388 - Now get out of my sight.\\
389 - Yes, sir.
All right.\\
390 - Sir.\\
391 - I could've had a Corvette!\\
392 - Oh, Red.\\
393 - No, Kitty, damn it, I'm pissed.\\
394 - I mean, Bull's a freako pervert\\
395 - and he gets everything he wants.\\
396 - I work hard, I raise a family,
and what do I get?\\
397 - A bowling ball in my TV.\\
398 - You know what I've got?\\
399 - Your keys.\\
400 - I want a big TV.\\
401 - A big one. This one's on sale.\\
402 - That's last year's model.\\
403 - And my TV's gonna be new.\\
404 - What about that one?\\
405 - No remote.\\
406 - My TV's gotta have a remote.\\
407 - Oh-ho-ho! Look at this.
Twenty-six-inch screen.\\
408 - I didn't even know
they made them that big.\\
409 - Dad, your old TV
wasn't that big.\\
410 - No. But my new TV's
gonna be that big.

\subsection {Episode 01: Garage Sale}
1 - Okay, Michael, I want you to
take me to the movies today.\\
2 - I'm way ahead of you, Jackie.
2:00, Smokey and the Bandit.\\
3 - No. No, no, no.\\
4 - I told you. I don't
want to see that again.\\
5 - I don't like the South.\\
6 - Do you want to see
The Goodbye Girl?\\
7 - Well, I would, but
it has two basic flaws,\\
8 - no smokey and no bandit.\\
9 - Yeah, plus,
isn't The Goodbye Girl,\\
10 - like, a girl movie?\\
11 - You moron. A girl movie
is a make-out movie.\\
12 - Well, then I'm in.\\
13 - Me, too.
I will come and watch.\\
14 - Okay...\\
15 - T-minus one hour
till the garage sale.\\
16 - Oh, I feel
like an astronaut.\\
17 - Oh, Red.
Remember how bad\\
18 - Eric wanted these roller skates?\\
19 - Oh... The yo-yo.\\
20 - Aw...\\
21 - Your plastic vomit.\\
22 - I fell for that.\\
23 - Yeah.\\
24 - You wasted a lot
of my money, son.\\
25 - Me and my damn childhood.\\
26 - You know, Mrs. Forman,
I feel real bad.\\
27 - I mean, you let me stay
here and everything.\\
28 - I wish I had something to
contribute to your garage sale.\\
29 - Oh, Steven, your loving
smile is contribution enough.\\
30 - No, it's not.\\
31 - Run that upstairs.\\
32 - You heard him, Kelso.
Move it.\\
33 - Hey, uh, Dad,\\
34 - Donna and I were gonna
go see The Goodbye Girl.\\
35 - Yeah. Well, I'm sure
it's a great movie, Eric...\\
36 - But you're gonna be
helping with the garage sale.\\
37 - It's important.\\
38 - Oh, right.
We're having a garage sale\\
39 - because you lost
your job... I mean...\\
40 - Because of all the clutter.\\
41 - Everybody needs to work, Eric.\\
42 - The gravy train has
made its last stop.\\
43 - Okay, there was a gravy train?\\
44 - Yup. And you missed it.\\
45 - Oh, Steven, I have a great idea.\\
46 - You could sell lemonade.\\
47 - Mrs. Forman, I've thrown
a lot of rocks\\
48 - at kids with
lemonade stands, and...\\
49 - Lord knows
I hate a hypocrite.\\
50 - You could have
a little bake sale.\\
51 - I pretty much beat up
any kid selling anything.\\
52 - Steven, you could...\\
53 - You could just do a little table\\
54 - with some cookies
and some brownies...\\
55 - I'm not much of...\\
56 - Brownies?\\
57 - I could make brownies.\\
58 - Because people love brownies!\\
59 - No, they don't.\\
60 - Oh, they love my brownies.\\
61 - Hangin' out\\
62 - Down the street\\
63 - The same old thing\\
64 - We did last week\\
65 - Not a thing to do\\
66 - But talk to you\\
67 - We're all all right\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
70 - Oh, Steven,\\
71 - you are such a joy to have
around the house.\\
72 - I can't believe
your mother abandoned you.\\
73 - I mean, went
on such a long trip.\\
74 - Boy, I sure do like brownies.\\
75 - Hey, uh, you know
what's got two thumbs\\
76 - and really likes brownies?\\
77 - This guy!\\
78 - Hyde! Oh, come on!\\
79 - I'm asking
you not to make\\
80 - these brownies.\\
81 - I mean, my mom and dad are...\\
82 - Way too fat.\\
83 - Nice cover.\\
84 - You know what, Eric,
you just leave him alone.\\
85 - This is Steven's contribution
to our garage sale.\\
86 - And I happen to know\\
87 - that you put the special
ingredient in these brownies.\\
88 - - "Special ingredient"?
- I told him not to!\\
89 - Yes.\\
90 - Love!\\
91 - Oh, yeah.\\
92 - There's a whole big bag
of love in there.\\
93 - Mom,\\
94 - crazy Helen from across the
street is switching price tags,\\
95 - and Dad says he's gonna
kick her in the keister.\\
96 - Oh, no, he'll do it, too.\\
97 - Hi, Kelso.\\
98 - Oh, look!
It's chocolate batter.\\
99 - I sure do wish I could finish\\
100 - all this chocolate batter
on my finger,\\
101 - but I just can't.\\
102 - Oh!\\
103 - Guess I can. Bye.\\
104 - Man, I was so close!\\
105 - Hey, you...\\
106 - God, you can't make special
brownies in my parents' kitchen.\\
107 - Oh, no.\\
108 - I already made them. If
only you'd warned me sooner.\\
109 - Come on, man, I'm serious.\\
110 - Look, Forman, relax, man, okay?\\
111 - Yeah, I'm making
special brownies,\\
112 - but I'm also
making regular brownies\\
113 - for the "straight folks"\\
114 - or "Losers".\\
115 - Yeah. Someday I'm gonna
own a restaurant,\\
116 - and everything's
gonna be special.\\
117 - And then when people
ask me, they say,\\
118 - "Hey, Kelso,
what's the special?"\\
119 - I'm gonna say, "Everything."\\
120 - I can't believe
you'd rather stay here\\
121 - than go see a movie with me.\\
122 - Oh, believe me, Donna,
I'd love to go,\\
123 - but Red said I can't, and...\\
124 - Well, he can kick my ass.\\
125 - Eric, I can kick your ass.\\
126 - - Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
127 - - Let's go. Come on. Bring it on.
- Let's go. Come on.\\
128 - Come on! You want a
big piece of Eric Forman?\\
129 - Let's go!\\
130 - Man, what are you doing?\\
131 - I'm lonely.\\
132 - Okay.\\
133 - Daddy, I've rounded up
some things\\
134 - to help the family out
in these trying times.\\
135 - There. You see, Eric?\\
136 - Your sister's a team player.\\
137 - No. These are
all my things.\\
138 - Grow up, Eric.
They're G.I. Joes.\\
139 - Yeah.\\
140 - G.I. Joes
with kung-fu grip!\\
141 - What a bitch...\\
142 - Aroony doony.\\
143 - Do you now or have you
ever had any association\\
144 - with the Point Place
Police Department?\\
145 - All right.
Here's your brownie.\\
146 - You got about 30 minutes
to get someplace safe.\\
147 - Kitty...\\
148 - I noticed you're selling\\
149 - the kissing dolphins
Bob and I bought you.\\
150 - You know, what is that
doing on this table?\\
151 - Red, I told you
not to sell that.\\
152 - Give it to me. I'll just, I'll run
it right back into the house.\\
153 - Oh. And, Red,\\
154 - you're also selling that pocket
fisherman we gave you for Christmas.\\
155 - Don't you want to run that
back into the house, too?\\
156 - No, Bob. That was
a really dumb gift.\\
157 - Okay, so...\\
158 - The Goodbye Girl starts
at 2:00, so I'd better go.\\
159 - Well, I guess this is
goodbye. Girl.\\
160 - Fez, you're so funny!\\
161 - Well, hello, Jackie.\\
162 - Did you see that, Fez?\\
163 - Yes, you did.\\
164 - She may be taking my
popcorn, but she knows\\
165 - there is more in my lap
than that.\\
166 - She wants you, old boy.\\
167 - Now's your chance.\\
168 - Be smooth.\\
169 - Think Ricardo Montalban.\\
170 - Just turn...\\
171 - Lock eyes...\\
172 - Go!\\
173 - Wait, wait, Fez,
what are you doing?\\
174 - - Oh, my God!
- You're a dead man!\\
175 - Could I have avoided this?
Let's review.\\
176 - First, Jackie said I was funny.\\
177 - Next, she ate popcorn
from my groin.\\
178 - Then I sucked her face.\\
179 - Nope. It was meant to be.\\
180 - Ay!\\
181 - Forman, this doesn't
make any sense.\\
182 - I'm out of brownies, but I
should have more money.\\
183 - Hyde, that's dirty money.
There's never enough.\\
184 - No, man.
It's like I lost\\
185 - an entire tray of brownies.\\
186 - Wait, what kind of brownies
did you lose, Hyde?\\
187 - Were they regular brownies?\\
188 - They were special brownies.\\
189 - Ah! Where was the
last place you had them?\\
190 - In the oven.\\
191 - In my mother's oven?\\
192 - Oh, now, Steven, your
brownies, they were a big hit.\\
193 - You know...\\
194 - I'm glad the plant is closing.\\
195 - It frees me up
to do my own thing.\\
196 - You said,
"Do my own thing!"\\
197 - Oh, Red. Your own thing.\\
198 - That's so hip!\\
199 - I love salt.\\
200 - I like that word, "Hip."\\
201 - It kinda pops, you know?\\
202 - Hip. Hip.\\
203 - Hip-puh!\\
204 - I can see my own mouth!\\
205 - You know what's beautiful?\\
206 - Fruitcake.\\
207 - All of the
different-colored little fruits\\
208 - living together in one cake.\\
209 - I jumped out of a cake once.\\
210 - I also like sweet,\\
211 - but there's just
something about salt.\\
212 - Hip.\\
213 - It starts to lose its meaning
after a while, you know?\\
214 - Hip.\\
215 - It's not even a word.\\
216 - Oh, my God, listen.\\
217 - You can hear my heart.\\
218 - Oh, my God!
There it is again.\\
219 - No. That's someone
at the door.\\
220 - Maybe it's the cops.\\
221 - It's just someone
for the garage sale.\\
222 - Take whatever you want!\\
223 - It won't fill the hole
in your life!\\
224 - I'll go see who it is.\\
225 - You know...\\
226 - For a terrible grouch,\\
227 - Red is great in bed.\\
228 - I'm sorry. What?\\
229 - Hippity hoppity\\
230 - Easter's on its way\\
231 - Where'd you go, Red?\\
232 - Well, I was hopping down
the old bunny trail...\\
233 - And this guy offered me $200\\
234 - for the Vista Cruiser.\\
235 - So I sold it to him.\\
236 - You sold Eric's car?\\
237 - Oh, no.\\
238 - Dad, you sold my car?\\
239 - How could you?\\
240 - Just what in the hell
were you thinking?\\
241 - I thought I was helping,\\
242 - because you're always
saying how you need money.\\
243 - For gas!\\
244 - For the car!\\
245 - Don't yell at him.\\
246 - To be honest, Red,
we're a little disappointed.\\
247 - I'm not gonna run any
more errands for you, pal.\\
248 - You should've checked
with us first, Red.\\
249 - You know how many times
I rotated those tires?\\
250 - You're not supposed to take
things that aren't yours.\\
251 - I had stuff in the backseat.\\
252 - Now that's all
just gone, mister.\\
253 - Forman, it's okay.\\
254 - No, it's not okay!\\
255 - Look, Red,\\
256 - who did you sell the car to?\\
257 - I sold it\\
258 - to a guy named...\\
259 - Peter.\\
260 - Peter...\\
261 - Cottontail.\\
262 - Hopping down
the bunny trail\\
263 - Hippity hoppity\\
264 - Easter's on its way\\
265 - In a way, I don't blame Fez.\\
266 - I'm very appealing.\\
267 - I just can't believe
he kissed you. That's...\\
268 - Donna, I have to
confess something.\\
269 - It wasn't terrible.\\
270 - How not terrible?\\
271 - It was the best kiss of my life!\\
272 - I mean, Fez is totally
not an option\\
273 - 'cause he's foreign
and everything, but...\\
274 - Michael has never
kissed me like that.\\
275 - What was so good about it?\\
276 - Do you know when Fez talks,\\
277 - he sometimes rolls his R's?\\
278 - Yeah.\\
279 - Well, that's what
he did in my mouth!\\
280 - Really?\\
281 - That actually sounds
kind of cool.\\
282 - I know!\\
283 - I mean, don't get me wrong.\\
284 - Eric's, you know, he's a great
kisser and everything, but...\\
285 - He's never, like,
rolled anything.\\
286 - Oh... I just love kissing.\\
287 - Don't you, Donna?\\
288 - I'm gonna go find Eric.\\
289 - Eric, I was just talking
to Jackie, and...\\
290 - Donna, not now, okay?\\
291 - See, Hyde?\\
292 - I asked you not to make special
brownies, but did you listen?\\
293 - - Well...
- Exactly. You didn't.\\
294 - You were just so smart.\\
295 - What were you thinking?\\
296 - - I...
- Yeah, that's it. Right. That's the problem.\\
297 - You weren't thinking.\\
298 - Now my folks are fried,
and I got no car.\\
299 - Wait a minute. Brownies?
Your mom and dad...\\
300 - Donna... Keep it zipped. Okay?\\
301 - Guess what, buddy.\\
302 - There's a lesson in all this.\\
303 - You know what that lesson is?\\
304 - - The lesson is...
- All right, why don't I just
tell you what the lesson is?\\
305 - You dance with Mary Jane,
you get your toes stepped on,\\
306 - that's right.\\
307 - Consequences, my friend.\\
308 - Yeah, consequences.\\
309 - Now my car is gone,
Red's high as a kite.\\
310 - Red's high as a kite?\\
311 - Okay, Miss Smart Mouth, shut it.\\
312 - Okay? Be quiet.\\
313 - I remembered
who I sold the car to.\\
314 - Who?\\
315 - I don't know, but I remembered.\\
316 - No, wait!
Red! Red! Think!\\
317 - Wait!\\
318 - Maybe his name is
on that check he gave me!\\
319 - Yeah! Maybe it is.\\
320 - Now what?\\
321 - Your parents
had the brownies, too.\\
322 - Well, if it isn't Fez.\\
323 - I'm Fez.\\
324 - In my country,\\
325 - we make out with
our friends' girlfriends\\
326 - because... La dee da.\\
327 - Oh, Kelso, I am sorry.\\
328 - Your girlfriend gives
me action in the pants.\\
329 - Oh, no, she doesn't.\\
330 - Yes, she does.\\
331 - She came up to me.
She said I was funny.\\
332 - Fez, sometimes\\
333 - when a girl says
that you're funny,\\
334 - it just means that you're funny.\\
335 - Well...\\
336 - I am freaking hilarious.\\
337 - Fez, Jackie is, like,
my girlfriend, okay?\\
338 - And we have this bond
between us,\\
339 - and nobody can come
between that bond.\\
340 - I thought you wanted to
fool around with Eric's sister.\\
341 - Well, yeah, her,
but that's, like, that's it.\\
342 - And you made out with Pam Macy.\\
343 - Okay, Fez, what's your point?\\
344 - My point is...\\
345 - You are a whore.\\
346 - Okay, then.
Apology accepted.\\
347 - You said that we were
going for ice cream!\\
348 - When we get the car back.\\
349 - You know, you did tell him you
were gonna get him ice cream.\\
350 - After!\\
351 - And you're not helping!\\
352 - Hey, put that down!\\
353 - Whoa!\\
354 - That really shot out of there!\\
355 - Sorry.\\
356 - Wait! Wait! Listen.\\
357 - I don't want to do this.\\
358 - Well, you have to.\\
359 - I'll wait in the car.\\
360 - No, no, Red. You have to
learn to take responsibility\\
361 - for your own actions.\\
362 - Well, that's stupid!\\
363 - Yeah?\\
364 - That's not the guy.\\
365 - Did your dad buy a car
this morning?\\
366 - A station wagon? Yeah.\\
367 - He bought that
piece of crap for me.\\
368 - "Piece of crap"?\\
369 - That's a Vista Cruiser!\\
370 - You could literally...\\
371 - Cruise the Vista.\\
372 - Daddy! Where are the keys
to the piece of crap?\\
373 - Boy, she's lovely.\\
374 - Give me his check.\\
375 - Right. And thanks again.\\
376 - I, too, understand.
Parents can be quite a...\\
377 - What a bitcheroony doony!\\
378 - So...\\
379 - You got your car back, Forman.\\
380 - Are we cool now?\\
381 - Yeah.\\
382 - Yeah, I think
you learned your lesson.\\
383 - Absolutely, man.\\
384 - I learned that
if I do something selfish,\\
385 - ill-advised, and irresponsible,\\
386 - I can get away with it.\\
387 - I rule!\\
388 - No! Big consequences!\\
389 - I'll tell you, Donna, sometimes
that guy just fills me with...\\
390 - Wow!\\
391 - You rolled your tongue.\\
392 - I know! Isn't it neat?\\
393 - Well, like...\\
394 - Uh, Dad, could you pass...\\
395 - - No!
- Okay.\\
396 - You know what'd
be great for dessert?\\
397 - Hot dogs.\\
398 - You read my mind.\\
399 - - I'll boil the water.
- No time!
\subsection {Episode 02: Red's Last Day}
1 - Yeah, even the radio works.\\
2 - And all the doors...\\
3 - They open!\\
4 - And it's got brakes, too.\\
5 - I mean, can you believe this?\\
6 - I mean, my uncle,
he just gave it to me.\\
7 - He gave it to me, for free!\\
8 - That is insane.\\
9 - I would pay
tens of dollars for this.\\
10 - Or not.\\
11 - Did he own a cat?\\
12 - Yeah. I'm getting an air
freshener. Yeah. Get a big one.\\
13 - Guys, guys, this thing is
like a bedroom on wheels.\\
14 - No more, "Michael, the
backseat's too small."\\
15 - "Michael,
you're on my hair."\\
16 - "Michael,
you're choking me."\\
17 - That's over.\\
18 - Wow, look at this piece of junk.\\
19 - This is my van.\\
20 - Yeah?
Well, you know,\\
21 - I had a Ford delivery
van in high school.\\
22 - Yeah, it's a lot of fun
till somebody gets preg...\\
23 - You got to be careful in this van,
Kelso. You know what I mean?\\
24 - What do you mean?\\
25 - Sell the van, kid.\\
26 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
27 - Oh, I'm happy.\\
28 - All right, you know what? Shouldn't
you guys be meditating or something,\\
29 - you know...\\
30 - Hey, come here Forman.\\
31 - I want you to feast your
eyes on this very large\\
32 - and flat cargo area.\\
33 - Wow, you could haul
plywood in this.\\
34 - Right.\\
35 - Or Donna.\\
36 - Why would I want to
haul... Oh, right! Okay.\\
37 - Nah, no. You know what?
She wouldn't do it in a van.\\
38 - She wants it to be special.\\
39 - What are you guys talking about?\\
40 - Oh! Uh...\\
41 - Plywood.\\
42 - Good, good.\\
43 - 'Cause I'm not
doing it in a van. Oh!\\
44 - Oh, you know what'll
make it really special?\\
45 - Not talking to your friends
about us doing it.\\
46 - Hangin' out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - We're all all right
We're all all right\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - Okay, Eric, it's your
father's last day at work,\\
55 - but don't mention it. In fact,
my advice to both you kids\\
56 - is just eat and get out.\\
57 - Mrs. Forman, I could
hide in the basement.\\
58 - No, no, I am not gonna have you
kids leave without your breakfast.\\
59 - You know what's fun?
A bacon sandwich.\\
60 - Here. You can eat it
in the car.\\
61 - Morning.
Oh, great.\\
62 - Now your father's going to
see three mouths he has to feed.\\
63 - Oh, you're wearing your
University of Wisconsin sweatshirt.\\
64 - Mother, I went there.\\
65 - No, you flunked out of there.\\
66 - You know, you might as well
just wear your University of\\
67 - I-wasted-my-father's-money
sweatshirt.\\
68 - Take it off.\\
69 - Oh, come on. No.\\
70 - Leave it on.\\
71 - She lacks character,
Mrs. Forman.\\
72 - Shut up! You are lucky
to even live here.\\
73 - You're an orphan.\\
74 - She called me an orphan.\\
75 - Hey, he's not an orphan.
His mom just abandoned him.\\
76 - Shut up, Forman!\\
77 - Okay, that's it. Everybody
hide in the basement. Go!\\
78 - Morning.\\
79 - Amen.
Everybody sit and eat.\\
80 - How are you?
Great.\\
81 - So, um...
What are you doing?\\
82 - Reading.\\
83 - Having some coffee.\\
84 - Is the coffee good?\\
85 - Okay.\\
86 - Everybody knows that today
is my last day at work.\\
87 - Last day that the plant is open.\\
88 - So...\\
89 - I just want to tell you all\\
90 - that everything is going
to be great.\\
91 - So...\\
92 - Great.\\
93 - Daddy, that is such good news.\\
94 - Can I have $20?\\
95 - You get in the basement.\\
96 - So, Jackie.\\
97 - What do you think?\\
98 - Oh, Michael, it's horrible.\\
99 - What are you talking about?\\
100 - You said it was cool
on the phone, Michael.\\
101 - But it's not. It's horrible.\\
102 - I can't be seen in this.
It's like...\\
103 - Ugh! It's like having a sty.\\
104 - Uh-oh, this van
will not be rocking.\\
105 - Oh, sure is something.\\
106 - Twenty-three years of working
here, and now it's all gone.\\
107 - Of course, you're gonna
find work. You're a supervisor.\\
108 - Well...
That's true. Excuse me.\\
109 - Sad as hell, ain't it, Red? Gee, it's a
real bad time for me to be getting laid off.\\
110 - You know, my husband Bucky,
his skin graft didn't take.\\
111 - Yeah, that's, uh, that's,
uh, real, uh, sad, Amy.\\
112 - Red, Dale, Amy. Hey, I'm stealing
office supplies.\\
113 - Red, you didn't want
your stapler, did you?\\
114 - No. Good, 'cause
I already stole it.\\
115 - Hey, Red, you know, uh,\\
116 - we're all going to go over
to Charlie's for one last drink.\\
117 - Thought maybe you could
pop in for one.\\
118 - Oh, no, I...\\
119 - I don't pop... I told you
he wouldn't come with us.\\
120 - He hates us.\\
121 - Well, I...\\
122 - Yeah, baby.\\
123 - Yup...\\
124 - You and me are going places.\\
125 - Having my baby\\
126 - It's another way of saying
how much I love you\\
127 - Having my baby\\
128 - Yeah! Paul Anka.\\
129 - Man, you kick some
serious musical ass.\\
130 - Thank you, Kelso.\\
131 - Man, I knew once I got
my van, I'd be having some\\
132 - bitching Hollywood parties.\\
133 - Right on, Kelso.\\
134 - I love the van.\\
135 - It's a real Lyle
Waggoner place to be.\\
136 - Yeah, yeah...
With a ride like this,\\
137 - you must get a butt-load
of ladies.\\
138 - Actually, Paul, I'm just
with Jackie at the moment.\\
139 - Just Jackie?\\
140 - What are you, an idiot?\\
141 - Well, Lyle, Paul...\\
142 - I know that a fine machine
like this would...\\
143 - Well, snag me lots of pelt...\\
144 - But I love Jackie...\\
145 - And a real man can deny
his man instincts.\\
146 - Who you talking to?
Oh!\\
147 - Aah...\\
148 - Oh.\\
149 - Hello...\\
150 - Laurie.\\
151 - What are you doing here?\\
152 - I'm bored.
There's nothing on TV.\\
153 - So, this is your new ride, huh?\\
154 - It is.\\
155 - It's really, uh, roomy.\\
156 - Listen, Laurie, uh...\\
157 - I don't think
you should be in here.\\
158 - I mean, I know we've made out\\
159 - a couple dozen times.
Uh-huh.\\
160 - Twice.
Okay.\\
161 - Uh...
But that's over.\\
162 - Gosh, I sure do feel
close to you, Kelso.\\
163 - Listen, Laurie, I...\\
164 - I don't think my girlfriend,\\
165 - Jackie would like you
sitting on me.\\
166 - I think you like me
sitting on you.\\
167 - In fact, I know you do.\\
168 - Okay...
But that's not the point.\\
169 - Shut up, Kelso.
This is your lucky day.\\
170 - Laurie, don't.
Stop.\\
171 - Hey...
Those are my pants!\\
172 - No!\\
173 - Yes.\\
174 - Yes.\\
175 - So, what's new?\\
176 - Kelso?\\
177 - Oh, man!
I mean, nothing.\\
178 - So, Eric, isn't your sister hot?\\
179 - No.\\
180 - In fact, Kelso, I think you're the
only loser here who thinks she is hot.\\
181 - Not true.\\
182 - I have pictured her naked
hundreds of times.\\
183 - Why, just this morning
I was taking a shower...\\
184 - Come on, Fez, man,\\
185 - it is absolutely inappropriate
and disrespectful\\
186 - to talk about how hot
somebody else's sister is.\\
187 - No matter how bad you
want to give it to her.\\
188 - Right, Kelso?\\
189 - Oh, man.\\
190 - Oh, man. I...\\
191 - What is it, boy?
Is it trouble?\\
192 - Is there something you want
to tell us about Eric's sister?\\
193 - I totally did it with her!\\
194 - I'm sorry, man.\\
195 - What?\\
196 - I mean,
she took advantage of me.\\
197 - I'm violated.\\
198 - You idiot,
your thumbs are still up.\\
199 - Acting's hard.\\
200 - Hey, shut up, perv.\\
201 - That's my sister.
Come on!\\
202 - I know.\\
203 - It is forbidden,
taboo, titillating.\\
204 - Isn't it ironic that titillating
has the word tit in it?\\
205 - Oh, man, that reminds me.\\
206 - No, shut up!\\
207 - Look, I swear to God,\\
208 - you say one more word
about my sister,\\
209 - and I'm gonna tell Jackie.\\
210 - Man...\\
211 - I forgot about Jackie.\\
212 - Right, right.
You forgot you have this huge,\\
213 - bitchy anchor tied
around your neck.\\
214 - I mean,
it could happen.\\
215 - So, I guess the first time
it actually really happened,\\
216 - was when I was horseback riding.\\
217 - Huh.\\
218 - So, you know...\\
219 - I think this van
could be pretty nice.\\
220 - You know what,
I'm glad he got it.\\
221 - At least it's a step
towards responsibility.\\
222 - Maybe Michael's maturing.\\
223 - Yeah, hang onto
that dream, Jackie.\\
224 - Donna, I'm serious.\\
225 - I think he's growing up.\\
226 - God, I'm so proud of him that,\\
227 - if I weren't already sleeping
with him, I'd sleep with him.\\
228 - So... Have you
and Eric done it yet?\\
229 - Yeah, we did it, and
I forgot to mention it.\\
230 - Oh.\\
231 - So what's the holdup?\\
232 - Whatever.\\
233 - It'll happen when it happens.\\
234 - Yeah, I guess if
I were Eric's girlfriend,\\
235 - I would not be in a hurry to do it
either.\\
236 - You know what? Maybe
you should ask Kelso\\
237 - if you could borrow
his van some night.\\
238 - Cool.\\
239 - So, like, uh...\\
240 - Which night?\\
241 - I don't know.
Some night.\\
242 - Is that like a Wednesday?\\
243 - Could be.\\
244 - Could tonight be some night?\\
245 - No.\\
246 - Well...\\
247 - I don't know. Maybe.\\
248 - You sure? You sure?\\
249 - Hey, where are the cushions?\\
250 - Look at me.\\
251 - I'm almost 50.\\
252 - You're not over 50?\\
253 - Oh, you got to shut up.
Shut up!\\
254 - I only know how to do one thing.\\
255 - I've been doing it
my whole life.\\
256 - It's not like another
one of these plants\\
257 - is gonna open up
in this crap hole.\\
258 - How am I gonna
support my family?\\
259 - Aw... To hell with it.\\
260 - At least I got you guys...\\
261 - And I love you guys.\\
262 - Thank you for calling, Amy.\\
263 - Yeah, bye.\\
264 - Eric, you have to go pick
your father up at Charlie's bar.\\
265 - Oh, is he drunk?\\
266 - No. He's not drunk.
He's not feeling well.\\
267 - Red's drunk.\\
268 - He is not. He is just...
He's not feeling well.\\
269 - Come on, Fez.
My dad's drunk.\\
270 - He is not drunk.
He is not feeling well!\\
271 - Mmm!\\
272 - Michael, these cushions
are really nice.\\
273 - Where'd you get them?\\
274 - Uh... I found them.\\
275 - You're nesting, Michael.
That is so mature.\\
276 - All right. Listen,
Jackie, we have to talk.\\
277 - This van is changing me.\\
278 - I know, Michael, I know.\\
279 - Great. 'Cause I want
you to be on board\\
280 - with what I'm gonna say.\\
281 - Transportation is a big
responsibility.\\
282 - That is so true.\\
283 - Yeah.\\
284 - So, I'd like
to see other people.\\
285 - No.\\
286 - What I mean to say is that you
and I should see other people.\\
287 - No.\\
288 - Okay. What if just
I see other people?\\
289 - No.\\
290 - Okay.\\
291 - Hey. Hey, hey.
The gang's all here.\\
292 - How you doing, Fez?\\
293 - Oh, my God, he knows my name.\\
294 - Hey, are those sideburns?\\
295 - Since eighth grade.\\
296 - Hey, bring these guys a beer.\\
297 - No, dad, I'm supposed
to take you home.\\
298 - Mom said so.\\
299 - Normally, you do what
your mother says.\\
300 - Sometimes, you know...\\
301 - You're a dumbass.\\
302 - But mostly, you're a good kid.\\
303 - Thank you, sir.\\
304 - But this is my last day
of work...\\
305 - And I didn't get a party.\\
306 - I didn't get a gold watch.\\
307 - And I didn't get crap.\\
308 - So...\\
309 - Let's drink!\\
310 - Hello?\\
311 - Hello, mother. ALL:
Hello, mother!\\
312 - This is your son, Eric.\\
313 - I'm not feeling well.\\
314 - I'll be right there.\\
315 - Oh, Red.\\
316 - I love you, Kitty.\\
317 - Uh-huh.\\
318 - Bartender, could I have
two coffees, please?\\
319 - And I'll have two more beers.\\
320 - Red...\\
321 - Okay, okay, I'll just
have the one beer.\\
322 - This isn't like you, Red.\\
323 - What, I can't have a beer?\\
324 - No, hanging around with people.\\
325 - You hate people.\\
326 - Yeah I do.\\
327 - You know we're gonna
get through this.\\
328 - Yeah, I know.\\
329 - Oh, heck, we've been through
worse times than these.\\
330 - Just for the fun of it, Kitty...\\
331 - When was that?\\
332 - Well, I don't know.\\
333 - Are you worried?
Nope.\\
334 - Are you worried?\\
335 - No.\\
336 - Nah, I'm not worried, Kitty.\\
337 - I'm too drunk to be worried.\\
338 - Up against the wall,
Redneck Mother\\
339 - Whoo-hoo\\
340 - Mother, who has raised
her son so well...\\
341 - Okay, you know what?
Let's turn that off.\\
342 - Hey, I got Amy's phone number.\\
343 - Good for you, Steven.\\
344 - Well...\\
345 - I hope she's still
pretty tomorrow.\\
346 - Okay, you know what? Let's just
turn that Redneck Mother song back on.\\
347 - He's 34 and drinking
in a honky-tonk\\
348 - Oh, play it for mama\\
349 - Kicking hippies asses
and raising hell\\
350 - Hey.\\
351 - God, where were you last night?\\
352 - I went and had a few
beers with the old man.\\
353 - It was pretty special.\\
354 - Oh, 'cause you know, I...\\
355 - I came by.\\
356 - You came by?\\
357 - Yeah.\\
358 - I came by 'cause
I was thinking...\\
359 - Last night was the night.\\
360 - Last night?
Mmm.\\
361 - I will definitely
be here tonight.\\
362 - No, tonight doesn't
feel right. Right.\\
363 - Not the way last night felt.
Oh, right.\\
364 - Oh, my God.\\
365 - I really do love Jackie,\\
366 - and she says that we
can't see other people.\\
367 - So...\\
368 - Oh, sweet Kelso.\\
369 - You're a tool, and I will
use you when I please.\\
370 - Okay, baby?\\

114 - I got nothing.\\
115 - All I can think
to do is tell this guy\\
116 - I'm experienced,
loyal, and hard-working.\\
117 - Son of a bitch!\\
118 - So, I brought my books.\\
119 - Michael, we're not gonna study.\\
120 - We're not?\\
121 - No.\\
122 - My parents are gonna
be gone for hours.\\
123 - Oh!\\
124 - So, what do you want to do?\\
125 - Oh, check
it out. Bowie.\\
126 - Man, he's cool.\\
127 - Yeah. Androgynous
guys are so manly.\\
128 - Michael?\\
129 - Do you know who would
look totally, totally sexy,\\
130 - glammed up like Bowie?\\
131 - Who?\\
132 - You, Michael.\\
133 - You're crazy.\\
134 - No, I'm not glam.\\
135 - No, come on, Michael,
you have such pretty eyes.\\
136 - Well, my lashes
do go out, like, a mile.\\
137 - And with this,\\
138 - I can flip 'em up.\\
139 - No way!
Yeah, yeah.\\
140 - Eric, you here?\\
141 - Yeah, I'm in the
living room, baby.\\
142 - What are you staring at?\\
143 - You're really...\\
144 - Brick house.\\
145 - Thanks, you wanna...
Shh.\\
146 - Let me just stare
at you for a second.\\
147 - Can we just...
Uh...\\
148 - Okay, I'm good.\\
149 - God, this is stupid.\\
150 - Shut up, Michael,
I'm almost done.\\
151 - I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.\\
152 - Okay. Here,
take a look.\\
153 - Fine.\\
154 - Ok, yeah.
My eyes are gorgeous.\\
155 - See? See,
I told you.\\
156 - Michael, do you know
what you need now?\\
157 - Some blush.\\
158 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jackie.\\
159 - All right, glam is one thing,\\
160 - but I think we're
crossing over into weird.\\
161 - No, no, trust me,
Michael. We're not.\\
162 - With cheekbones like that,\\
163 - blush is your best friend.\\
164 - Yeah, I do have
bitchin' cheekbones.\\
165 - Okay, let's blush.\\
166 - People are so
friendly around here.\\
167 - Two women on the corner\\
168 - just offered to
have sex with me.\\
169 - Yeah, for money, Fez.\\
170 - I could not ask them for money.\\
171 - Or could I?\\
172 - Wow, guys, check out this crowd.\\
173 - I know. This is gonna be
so great.\\
174 - Let's go see
how long the wait is.\\
175 - Excuse me, how long...
You're in.\\
176 - Oh, man.
I'm so up for this.\\
177 - Not you.\\
178 - Well, that's fine. I'll
just wait with you guys.\\
179 - No, we're next.
Go in.\\
180 - Yeah? All right. I'll
see you guys inside.\\
181 - You know what?\\
182 - This is probably just
some kind of fire code thing.\\
183 - Yeah, okay, wait. What's
going on? We're next.\\
184 - No, you're not.\\
185 - What are you talking about?\\
186 - Well, Archie...\\
187 - I'm here to let
the cool people in\\
188 - and keep the geeks out.\\
189 - Those poor, stupid geeks.\\
190 - Oh, my God, we are geeks!\\
191 - Hey...\\
192 - Did slipping the
bouncer a $10 work?\\
193 - Yes, it did, Hyde.\\
194 - That's why I'm inside the club.\\
195 - There you are.\\
196 - This place is awesome.
Why aren't you inside?\\
197 - Oh, we were in. We
were on the inside.\\
198 - I didn't see you.\\
199 - Oh, yeah.
We waved at you,\\
200 - but you were, uh...\\
201 - Dancing.
Excellent.\\
202 - Uh, you were dancing,\\
203 - and then we went through this...\\
204 - Door. Yes. We went
through this door,\\
205 - and we were locked out.\\
206 - Uh, and then we had to get
in the back of the line, so...\\
207 - All right, well, when you get
back inside, find me.\\
208 - Go, yeah.
Yeah, go.\\
209 - We'll meet on the inside.\\
210 - - Okay.
- Yeah, go.\\
211 - That was really smooth.\\
212 - Smooth enough to get us in?\\
213 - No.\\
214 - Okay, that's it.
You must let me in.\\
215 - Why?\\
216 - Because I feel the
hot rhythm of disco\\
217 - burning in my loins.\\
218 - Watch.\\
219 - Okay. You're in.\\
220 - So long, losers.\\
221 - So, you're saying that
this stuff won't come off?\\
222 - Like, even if I cry?\\
223 - Man, that's great.\\
224 - Oh, Michael, you are the
best doll I have ever had.\\
225 - You know what? I have
the perfect gown for you.\\
226 - All right, Jackie, slow down.\\
227 - Okay, wearing lipstick
is one thing,\\
228 - but a gown?
That's kind of fruity.\\
229 - No, no, it's not, Michael.\\
230 - Bowie wears dresses.\\
231 - Joe Namath wears pantyhose.\\
232 - Jackie. No.\\
233 - I'll be right back.\\
234 - Jackie, I said no.\\
235 - All right. Nothing too
girly, and I mean it!\\
236 - Well, so much for your "He
can't stop both of us" theory.\\
237 - This bites, man.\\
238 - He can't keep us out
of there. I mean, what,\\
239 - did we wake up in
Russia this morning?\\
240 - No. We did not,
in fact,\\
241 - wake up in Russia this morning.\\
242 - I didn't think so.\\
243 - Hey, let me tell
you something, pal.\\
244 - You're propping up
a dying system, man.\\
245 - You see, someday soon,
people are gonna wake up,\\
246 - and they're gonna realize
that most of us don't fit into your\\
247 - Hollywood, Madison Avenue,
candy-coated ideal of what's cool.\\
248 - And when we do,
we're gonna rise up,\\
249 - we're gonna put you on trial,\\
250 - then parade through the streets\\
251 - with your head on a stick!\\
252 - Righteous political
outrage. You're in.\\
253 - All right.
I'll see you later, Forman.\\
254 - Yeah, well,\\
255 - when the revolution comes, man,\\
256 - your backs could be up
against the wall...\\
257 - Damn it, let me in!
My girlfriend's in there!\\
258 - The foxy redhead?\\
259 - I thought that was your sister.\\
260 - What does she see in you?\\
261 - You know what she sees, buddy?\\
262 - You know what she sees?\\
263 - Well, let me tell you something,\\
264 - if she was the bouncer, I'd
be in that stupid club right now,\\
265 - you big ass.\\
266 - Yeah. I said it.\\
267 - Hi, honey.\\
268 - Uh-oh.\\
269 - I didn't get the job.\\
270 - Okay, well, you will
get them next time.\\
271 - Aw, Kitty...\\
272 - The world's changing.\\
273 - Things aren't turning out
the way I expected.\\
274 - Well, Red,\\
275 - what did you expect?\\
276 - Well...\\
277 - I don't know, I...\\
278 - Take that, Hirohito.\\
279 - And that.\\
280 - Yes, with America's victory
overseas now complete,\\
281 - our fighting boys return home,\\
282 - where the American working man\\
283 - takes his rightful place
on the throne.\\
284 - "Hi, honey.
How was your day?"\\
285 - "They gave me
another raise."\\
286 - "Oh, honey, with all
the money you make,\\
287 - "it's no wonder
I don't have to work."\\
288 - Daughter Laurie has a question.\\
289 - "Daddy, why is
the American economy\\
290 - "the envy of the world?"\\
291 - "Well," says Dad,\\
292 - "It's because
the American worker\\
293 - "is experienced, loyal,
and hard-working."\\
294 - Looks like junior
has some good news.\\
295 - "Say, Dad, you can stop
giving me money now.\\
296 - "I just got a football
scholarship to Notre Dame."\\
297 - "I guess experience, loyalty,
and hard work really do pay off."\\
298 - Daughter Laurie
has another question.\\
299 - "Daddy, can you tell me\\
300 - "why Germany and Japan's
economies never recovered?"\\
301 - "It's simple.
They are not experienced.\\
302 - "They are not hard-working.\\
303 - "They are not loyal.\\
304 - "And they do not
speak English."\\
305 - Speaking of work, Mom
has to go grocery shopping.\\
306 - "Can I have the keys
to the Cadillac?"\\
307 - "Forget the Cadillac.\\
308 - "Take the hovercraft."\\
309 - Red... The hovercraft?\\
310 - Hovercraft?\\
311 - What? They promised us
hovercrafts.\\
312 - It's just another damn
broken promise.\\
313 - Okay, cream, two sugars.\\
314 - Well, you just drink up,\\
315 - and I'll just, I don't
know, head inside.\\
316 - Yeah. No.\\
317 - Oh, come on.
You suck.\\
318 - Mr. Big shot
bouncer.\\
319 - Mr. "I open and close
the rope."\\
320 - Mr. Boat man on
the River Styx.\\
321 - Just, God, I bet you've
never been excluded\\
322 - from anything in
your whole life.\\
323 - Hey, that's not fair.\\
324 - I've been excluded
from lots of things.\\
325 - Yeah? Like what?\\
326 - Oh, no, okay.\\
327 - Uh, when I was in kindergarten,\\
328 - we used to play
"Duck, duck, goose"...\\
329 - And nobody ever picked me
to be the goose.\\
330 - Oh, wow. That
must have really hurt.\\
331 - I didn't care.\\
332 - You didn't care?
Uh-huh.\\
333 - So, you're just sitting there,\\
334 - watching this kid
go around the circle,\\
335 - duck, duck, duck...\\
336 - He'd get closer and closer.\\
337 - Duck... You'd be
shaking with anticipation.\\
338 - Duck...
"Maybe he'll pick me."\\
339 - Duck... "Maybe I'll
get to run and laugh\\
340 - "with the joy
of being a goose."\\
341 - And then he'd come
to you, place his hand\\
342 - on your head and say
"Duck." And you're telling me\\
343 - you didn't care?\\
344 - Okay, yeah, it hurts. Yes,\\
345 - thank you. That's
what I'm saying.\\
346 - And now you...\\
347 - Have made me...\\
348 - The duck!\\
349 - Wow.\\
350 - Oh, man.
I didn't realize.\\
351 - Dance, goose.\\
352 - Dance.\\
353 - Oh, God, Michael, in that dress,\\
354 - you are way prettier than Bowie.\\
355 - Hell, I'm prettier than you.\\
356 - That's not funny, Michael.\\
357 - Did you just hear a car pull up?\\
358 - Relax, Jackie,\\
359 - your parents aren't
supposed to be home\\
360 - for, like, like, another hour.\\
361 - Spin me.\\
362 - Hi, Daddy.\\
363 - We're studying.\\
364 - Daddy, no!
Daddy, I love him!\\
365 - Wow. What a night, right?\\
366 - Oh, phew, exactly.\\
367 - Donna, why are you with me?\\
368 - Um, the bouncer wanted to know.\\
369 - What did you tell him?\\
370 - You know, I couldn't
think of a reason.\\
371 - Hmm.\\
372 - You know, come to
think of it, I can't either.\\
373 - What I need to do is find a guy\\
374 - who's, like, totally
different from you.\\
375 - Maybe big and dumb and,
you know, not nice to me.\\
376 - Oh, and no sense of humor,\\
377 - so when I tell a
joke, he doesn't get it.\\
378 - I mean, that's a real turn on.\\
379 - Okay, enough.
No. No, no, no.\\
380 - Seriously.
Thank you.\\
381 - I mean, if you hadn't
have pointed this out to me,\\
382 - I might have wasted
years with you.\\
383 - I mean, I almost
had sex with you.\\
384 - Whoo! Thank you.\\
385 - Okay, I think
the question has become\\
386 - why am I with you?\\
387 - Oh, right, okay.\\
388 - I had a great time.\\
389 - Good night.\\
390 - Yeah.\\
391 - Last night, I was with Jackie...\\
392 - Tonight, I'll be with Laurie.\\
393 - It's just the kind of life
that a stud like me leads.\\
394 - What?\\
395 - Kelso,
your mascara's running.\\
396 - Damn.\\
397 - She told me it was waterproof.
\subsection {Episode 04: Laurie and the Professor}
1 - So, look at us.\\
2 - This is just like a
Norman Rockwell painting.\\
3 - Mom is serving breakfast,\\
4 - Daddy's reading the newspaper,\\
5 - and brother Eric is trying to
hide a big, purple, nasty hickey.\\
6 - What? Hickey,
I don't have a hickey.\\
7 - You know, Eric, hickeys
lead to dirty things.\\
8 - For God's sakes, don't
let Donna suck your neck.\\
9 - She's a nice girl.\\
10 - I don't have a hickey. I
was using a curling iron.\\
11 - Oh, well, will you
just look at that.\\
12 - No! Mom!\\
13 - Red, remember that time...\\
14 - No, and neither do you.\\
15 - Okay.\\
16 - So, um, Laurie,\\
17 - what's on the agenda
today? Agenda?\\
18 - A list of goals or actions\\
19 - one might feel good
about achieving\\
20 - so as to...
Eric, you tell her.\\
21 - Mom, come on, relax.\\
22 - I'm still getting used
to being back home.\\
23 - Yeah, flunking out of college
can be draining, phew!\\
24 - Eric!\\
25 - Oh, come on, that was so mild.\\
26 - Well, Laurie, all you do is sit
around the house and watch television.\\
27 - You should come down to
the hospital and volunteer.\\
28 - She's right, Laurie.\\
29 - Daddy!\\
30 - You know, I think Eric needs
an agenda. Look at his neck.\\
31 - It's a birthmark. It's
been there since birth.\\
32 - Good morning, class.\\
33 - Oh, good morning, orphan.\\
34 - Good morning.\\
35 - That's all you got?\\
36 - Whore.\\
37 - Mom, he called me a whore.\\
38 - Yeah.
Steven, honey...\\
39 - You are too young for
coffee. Have some juice.\\
40 - Mrs. Forman,
I need coffee.\\
41 - Your son kept me up all night\\
42 - bragging about his hickey.\\
43 - Hangin' out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
52 - Okay. Whatever
you do, Eric,\\
53 - do not wear a turtleneck
to school, okay?\\
54 - It's a dead giveaway.\\
55 - Yeah, I'd go for
a decorative scarf.\\
56 - Thank you.\\
57 - Did you have to tell
everyone about the hickey?\\
58 - Well, everyone can
kind of see it, Vampira.\\
59 - Laurie had a field day
at breakfast.\\
60 - Yeah, I hopped
on that dog pile, too.\\
61 - You sure did, you dillhole.\\
62 - All right, Forman,
yeah, that was sort of mean.\\
63 - Probably what
I should have said is...\\
64 - "I'm sick of
sharing a room with you\\
65 - "and all of your disgusting
fluids and gases."\\
66 - Oh, and yours are
just dreamy, Hyde.\\
67 - Excuse me, may I please
have a hickey, please?\\
68 - No.\\
69 - Please?
No!\\
70 - Jackie?
No!\\
71 - Please?
No!\\
72 - So, the two of you do things\\
73 - to please your man.\\
74 - Well, Fez is a man.\\
75 - Why do you not please him?\\
76 - Why?\\
77 - Jackie, just give him a hickey.\\
78 - Okay, I'm going home.\\
79 - Me, too.\\
80 - Gotta go shopping with my mom.\\
81 - Suddenly it's like
really important\\
82 - that we be best friends.\\
83 - What happened?
She's been reading.\\
84 - Reading. Damn it,
when will they learn?\\
85 - Yeah, finally, I thought
Jackie'd never leave.\\
86 - Okay, Kelso, what are you doing?\\
87 - Well, I need a sexy
memento from Laurie.\\
88 - I'm gonna commemorate
our forbidden love...\\
89 - With panties.\\
90 - Fine. Just take your
panties and go home.\\
91 - Man, those are
my mom's! Come on!\\
92 - Okay, Forman, look, man,\\
93 - I'm not telling you
how to live your life,\\
94 - but if someone touched
my mom's panties...\\
95 - Hyde, didn't everyone
touch your mom's panties?\\
96 - Burn!\\
97 - Man, that was a burn.\\
98 - Okay, Forman, I have a solution\\
99 - to this whole
"You being a pain in my ass,\\
100 - "we sharing a room" thing.\\
101 - You move out.\\
102 - Of my room?
Yeah.\\
103 - Well, uh, that's just
not gonna happen.\\
104 - Ok, fine, I'll move out,
you big baby.\\
105 - Still friends?\\
106 - I need time to heal.\\
107 - Okay, these are Laurie's, right?\\
108 - Kelso, what exactly are you
gonna do with those panties?\\
109 - Just look at 'em.\\
110 - Kelso, did you ever notice\\
111 - that Laurie and Eric
have the same eyes?\\
112 - So, if you're doing it
with Laurie,\\
113 - and she's perhaps wearing a hat,\\
114 - it's kind of like you're
doing it with Eric, too.\\
115 - So, here we are...
Together... Again.\\
116 - Yeah.\\
117 - I'm just loving the time
we spend together, Donna.\\
118 - In my new book,
Our Mothers, Ourselves,\\
119 - it says we're
supposed to be friends.\\
120 - We should talk to
each other and listen.\\
121 - Your stupid father
never listens.\\
122 - Is there anything in your book
about not insulting my father?\\
123 - Oh, I don't know, I only
read the first chapter.\\
124 - Okay, no more talking
about your father.\\
125 - So, how do you like
the clogs I bought you?\\
126 - Oh, they're awesome.\\
127 - Oh, good, 'cause
your father's an ass!\\
128 - Kelso took your underwear.\\
129 - Aw, that's like the third pair.\\
130 - Ew.\\
131 - Gimme the remote control.\\
132 - Gimme a reason why I
shouldn't set you on fire.\\
133 - All right, Laurie,
take your best shot!\\
134 - Oh, Red, we talked
about this. Let him go.\\
135 - Hello, Laurie.\\
136 - I apologize for
coming unannounced,\\
137 - but I...\\
138 - Mom, Daddy,
this is Professor Stark.\\
139 - He was my art history teacher.\\
140 - Well, actually, I was
your psychology teacher.\\
141 - Well, whatever you
taught her, she flunked it.\\
142 - Eric.\\
143 - So, you're from the, uh,
University of Wisconsin?\\
144 - Are you here
to give me back my money?\\
145 - Well, actually, I came
here because of Laurie.\\
146 - Oh, yes.
He came to see\\
147 - if the university
would take me back.\\
148 - Really? Oh, please,
here, have a seat.\\
149 - I'll make coffee and cake...\\
150 - I'll make coffee cake.
And coffee!\\
151 - Oh, gosh, really,
can you get her back\\
152 - into the university
and out of my house?\\
153 - Well, I'm going
to try my darndest.\\
154 - Well, this is really good news.\\
155 - This is the best news
I've ever heard.\\
156 - Yes it is. I want to get
Laurie back in school.\\
157 - Professor, question.\\
158 - Uh, how lame, exactly,
is your student body\\
159 - if you're trying to get
this dumb cow back in...\\
160 - Eric!
Don't be a smart mouth.\\
161 - We've got company.\\
162 - Yeah, yeah, go make coffee.\\
163 - Don't scare him off.
He's our only hope.\\
164 - So, um, maybe you could
stay for dinner?\\
165 - Why, yes, thank you.
That... That would be lovely.\\
166 - Oh, and I believe, uh,
these paint chips are yours.\\
167 - Well, these are the color of
our front door, aren't they?\\
168 - Yeah. You had a paint chip
hanging from your front door\\
169 - so I... I started
to peel it\\
170 - and I guess I got
a little overzealous.\\
171 - Um, psychology, huh?\\
172 - Yes, yes.\\
173 - Human foibles fascinate me.\\
174 - Hey, Dad.\\
175 - Where have you two been?\\
176 - Uh, Mom bought me these
clogs. Aren't they great?\\
177 - Oh, she bought you clogs.\\
178 - With my money.\\
179 - So, officially,
I bought you clogs.\\
180 - No, Bob, I bought her the clogs.\\
181 - Get in the car, Donna. I'm
gonna buy you something.\\
182 - Uh, actually, Dad, I've
got homework and...\\
183 - Do you love your daddy?\\
184 - Yes. Let's go.\\
185 - Looks like you're going
shopping with the big ass!\\
186 - I don't think so.\\
187 - Eric, I need you
to go to the store\\
188 - and get me three pounds
of ground beef, lean.\\
189 - Mom, look,\\
190 - before you go and blow 20 more
cents a pound on ground beef,\\
191 - this guy is not gonna get
Laurie back into college.\\
192 - She's stupid and evil.\\
193 - Mostly stupid.\\
194 - Eric, she's not stupid.\\
195 - She's just...
She has... Special...\\
196 - Just go.\\
197 - Hyde!\\
198 - Oh, honey, just
share the room with Eric.\\
199 - No, thank you. I'm fine.\\
200 - Oh...\\
201 - Busted.\\
202 - No way!\\
203 - Yep. Laurie
and her professor,\\
204 - tonguing in the garage
like hungry dogs.\\
205 - It was very disgusting.\\
206 - No, no, you see, because Laurie\\
207 - wouldn't just make out
with some old guy.\\
208 - She wouldn't do that.\\
209 - No, it's true, man.\\
210 - I was in the upstairs closet
trying out my cot,\\
211 - and I saw 'em.\\
212 - It was like live porno,\\
213 - but not good porno, 'cause
he's, like, really, really old.\\
214 - It was like old bad porno.\\
215 - Michael, why do you care\\
216 - if Laurie kisses her professor?\\
217 - Yeah, Kelso, why do you care?\\
218 - Well... Because...\\
219 - You see, it's wrong
for an old person\\
220 - to make out with an
innocent young student.\\
221 - God, you're noble.\\
222 - Innocent?\\
223 - Okay, Eric, no offense,\\
224 - but your sister is
as slutty as they come.\\
225 - Eric, are you gonna let her
say that about your sister?\\
226 - Sure.\\
227 - Hey, Forman, did you realize\\
228 - that there's a room
back here, man?\\
229 - And it barely stinks!\\
230 - Perfect. You can sit back
there beneath your bare bulb\\
231 - writing angry letters
to the government.\\
232 - Oh,
don't think I won't.\\
233 - You see what's beautiful
here, people?\\
234 - I finally have
something on Laurie.\\
235 - I own her. Oh, yeah,
she is so screwed.\\
236 - All right. Just be nice.\\
237 - Look. Did everyone
see my hickey?\\
238 - Somebody loves me.\\
239 - Moron, you gave that
to yourself.\\
240 - It's still wet.\\
241 - Oh, no, I did not.\\
242 - Somebody loves me.\\
243 - There is a lady love.\\
244 - There is!\\
245 - So, you like the shirt
I bought you?\\
246 - It's very nice.\\
247 - I wasn't sure,\\
248 - because you didn't
put it on in the store,\\
249 - like you did with the clogs.\\
250 - I knew it.
You hate the shirt.\\
251 - Nice digs, huh?\\
252 - It's perfect.\\
253 - This is the room
where we put all that crap\\
254 - we just can't throw away.\\
255 - Like you.\\
256 - Forman, is it just me or do
your mom and dad like me\\
257 - a whole lot better
than they like you?\\
258 - See, I kid, but you hurt.\\
259 - Boys, dinner!\\
260 - All right, man,\\
261 - you ready to make Laurie
squeal like the family pig?\\
262 - Oh, yes.\\
263 - You're gonna punk out,
aren't you?\\
264 - Well, it is my nature.\\
265 - Look, Forman, you've always
been the runt of the litter.\\
266 - This is your chance to
bite the big dog on the ass.\\
267 - So, my advice to you is...\\
268 - Bite the big dog on the ass.\\
269 - Okay, what if I let her off
with a warning, you know?\\
270 - Just this one time.\\
271 - Well, that would be
the mature choice...\\
272 - But not evil!\\
273 - You gotta think evil, man!\\
274 - Where would we be
without the A-bomb?\\
275 - Well, actually, the war
was all but won when...\\
276 - Shut up! Okay, now,
let's... Let's review.\\
277 - Daddy, Eric has dirty
magazines under his bed.\\
278 - Daddy, Eric snuck out
last night.\\
279 - Daddy, I saw Eric
drinking all your beer.\\
280 - Daddy, Eric made it hard
for me to concentrate,\\
281 - so I flunked out of college.\\
282 - Daddy, Eric used
all my hand lotion.\\
283 - Okay, that bitch is dead.\\
284 - So, um, this news
about Laurie leaving\\
285 - is just a little ray of
sunshine.\\
286 - Well, I just wish
that more teachers\\
287 - cared about their students
like you do.\\
288 - I think it all started
going downhill\\
289 - when you couldn't
paddle the kids anymore.\\
290 - Pansy-ass
supreme court.\\
291 - Shut up.\\
292 - Hey, Forman,\\
293 - he who hesitates is boned.\\
294 - Laurie is one of the
most gifted young women\\
295 - in my class.\\
296 - I've always enjoyed having her.\\
297 - I own you.\\
298 - Is there something
wrong with the bread?\\
299 - No. Why?\\
300 - Oh, Laurie...\\
301 - I know something\\
302 - that you don't know\\
303 - that I know, you know?\\
304 - Yes, yes.\\
305 - Tell us, Forman,
so that we can all know.\\
306 - You don't know anything.\\
307 - And if you do know something,\\
308 - I will make you sorry
you were ever born.\\
309 - Well, for your information,\\
310 - I'm already sorry
I was ever born.\\
311 - Eric!\\
312 - See?\\
313 - So, what does she need to do
to get back into school?\\
314 - Well, she'll have
to work with me,\\
315 - make a commitment to school.\\
316 - She'll really have
to buckle down.\\
317 - Well, what do you think, Laurie?\\
318 - Are you willing to give it a go?\\
319 - Oh, Mother,
she's very willing.\\
320 - You know, Dad, I just saw
the most interesting thing today,\\
321 - in the garage.\\
322 - Burst into
flames, burst into flames!\\
323 - Burst into flames!\\
324 - It was just... It was
so surprising.\\
325 - Oh, Eric, do tell.\\
326 - I saw Laurie...\\
327 - I'm in love with your daughter.\\
328 - Dad...\\
329 - Da... Hey!
Come back here!\\
330 - Did you two have fun?\\
331 - A blast.\\
332 - Oh, Donna, that shirt
your father bought you\\
333 - makes you look so fat.\\
334 - Yeah? Well, those clogs
make you look like a duck.\\
335 - Okay, you know what?\\
336 - Both of you guys
really need to shut up.\\
337 - I'm so sick of
hearing you fight.\\
338 - Do you even know what
you're fighting about?\\
339 - Uh... I know
she started it!\\
340 - I only got mad because I
knew you were gonna get mad.\\
341 - All right, okay, what...
You know what? Whatever.\\
342 - Just no more fighting with
each other through me. Got it?\\
343 - Although I would like you
to continue buying me things.\\
344 - I mean, thank you.\\
345 - She likes
the shirt better\\
346 - You're an ass, Bob!\\
347 - Ooh, good comeback, ooh!\\
348 - Ooh!\\
349 - Mr. Forman, I really want
to get Laurie back in school.\\
350 - Oh, for God's sake, Laurie,\\
351 - the man's in love with you
and you still couldn't pass?\\
352 - So?\\
353 - So I guess
I disappointed you, Daddy.\\
354 - I'm really sorry.\\
355 - I just wish he wouldn't have\\
356 - taken advantage of me
and my love for education.\\
357 - That is just so weak.\\
358 - Well,\\
359 - I guess you're not
the first student\\
360 - to be taken advantage
of by a teacher.\\
361 - Oh, wait. Where are you going
with that, Dad?\\
362 - Just try not to be
too hard on yourself.\\
363 - No, no!\\
364 - No!\\
365 - And the really sad thing is\\
366 - Eric saw him kiss me today,\\
367 - and he didn't even
try to stop him.\\
368 - 'Cause she wanted it!\\
369 - You knew about this and
you didn't do anything?\\
370 - She's your sister!\\
371 - Yeah, Eric. Why?\\
372 - I'll deal with you later, Eric.\\
373 - Come on, Laurie. I'll
make you a cup of coffee\\
374 - and explain to you
the nature of men.\\
375 - Something I thought
you already knew,\\
376 - but apparently you don't.\\
377 - Oh, Eric, I forgive you.\\
378 - Well, this is unforgivable.\\
379 - In fact, you suck!\\
380 - I'll be in my room.\\
381 - Oh, Mom. Oh, my god, Mom.\\
382 - I had her in my sights.\\
383 - I mean, she was
right in the cross hairs.\\
384 - Oh, honey...\\
385 - You know I love you
and your sister equally.\\
386 - But if you ever get
an opportunity again,\\
387 - for God's sake,
pull the trigger.\\
388 - I'm gonna tell you
something, Laurie.\\
389 - If you slept
with that professor,\\
390 - it's over between you and me.\\
391 - Kelso, I slept with
him a thousand times.\\
392 - Why must you hurt me?\\
393 - Shut up.\\
394 - Hey, hey! Get out!\\
395 - Get out!\\
396 - I hate you both.\\
397 - Go home, Fez.
\subsection {Episode 05: Halloween}
1 - "A UNICEF contribution
of 13 cents\\
2 - "will feed a child
for a month."\\
3 - Man, living in Africa
must be great.\\
4 - Everything's so cheap.\\
5 - If you ask me, man,
UNICEF's a scam.\\
6 - If we ask you,
everything's a scam.\\
7 - Everything is a scam.\\
8 - Oh, lighten up.\\
9 - Remember how much fun
Halloween used to be?\\
10 - Making costumes,
trick-or-treating.\\
11 - What is trick-or-treating?\\
12 - Well, you put on a costume,
you go door-to-door\\
13 - and say, "Trick or treat,"
and people give you candy.\\
14 - Oh, you got to be kidding me.\\
15 - They just give you candy?\\
16 - The best part of Halloween is
getting the crap scared out of you.\\
17 - One year I saw
The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\
18 - I couldn't sleep
for, like, a month.\\
19 - They give you candy?\\
20 - Just like that?
No strings?\\
21 - Yes, Fez.
Get over it.\\
22 - Hey, you guys, you know what?\\
23 - My church is doing
a haunted house.\\
24 - I really don't think
anyone's gonna be scared\\
25 - by a bunch of Episcopalians.\\
26 - Unless they have chainsaws.\\
27 - Let's go see The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre.\\
28 - Michael, I told you,\\
29 - I don't like Texans.\\
30 - I know.
We could go to Old Main.\\
31 - Our old grammar school?\\
32 - Yeah, sure, you know.\\
33 - A dark, burnt-out,
boarded-up school.\\
34 - Very creepy.\\
35 - We could... You know,
we could tell ghost stories.\\
36 - Free candy?\\
37 - Even if you're not
from this country?\\
38 - Yes!\\
39 - Hey, why'd they
burn down the school, anyway?\\
40 - Oh, they said it was arson.\\
41 - What? I was out of town
that week.\\
42 - Hmm.\\
43 - How convenient.\\
44 - So you're telling me\\
45 - that if I showed up
at someone's house\\
46 - and say, "Trick or treat,"\\
47 - they'll give me
a free piece of candy?\\
48 - Yes!\\
49 - Oh, I don't believe you.\\
50 - Trick or treat.\\
51 - An apple?\\
52 - Where's my candy,
you son of a bitch?\\
53 - Hangin' out\\
54 - Down the street\\
55 - The same old thing\\
56 - We did last week\\
57 - Not a thing to do\\
58 - But talk to you\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - We're all all right\\
61 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
62 - Ahhh!\\
63 - Oh, she's very good.\\
64 - I like her.
I hope she lives.\\
65 - Ahhh!\\
66 - Huh.\\
67 - Oh, well.\\
68 - Why doesn't anyone
just shoot him?\\
69 - I mean, it's Texas.\\
70 - Everyone has a gun.\\
71 - Ahhh!\\
72 - Yeah, yeah.
This movie's so lame.\\
73 - Man, she deserved it.\\
74 - She had sex.\\
75 - And like all movie sluts
before her, she must die.\\
76 - Ahhh!\\
77 - No. She was about to
take her shirt off.\\
78 - Trick or treat!\\
79 - Okay, here you go.\\
80 - Mmm!\\
81 - Raisins!\\
82 - Ew!\\
83 - No, raisins are good for you.\\
84 - Raisins are nature's candy.\\
85 - And eggs are nature's
hand grenades.\\
86 - Kitty, don't give 'em raisins.\\
87 - It just pisses 'em off.\\
88 - Jeez, I hate Halloween.\\
89 - Well, you used to love
Halloween.\\
90 - Remember that party we had\\
91 - when we first moved in here?\\
92 - Oh. Mother Forman.\\
93 - I see that you
let yourself in again.\\
94 - Boy, that's
an awful lot of food.\\
95 - I can't imagine that you
have that many friends, Kitty.\\
96 - Oh.\\
97 - Well, speaking of friends,\\
98 - how are your four cats?\\
99 - Hey, Frank, uh,\\
100 - pull my finger.\\
101 - No way.\\
102 - You were killin' me
in the car, man.\\
103 - Oh, good, you're home.\\
104 - Hey, Kitty.\\
105 - I like your outfit.\\
106 - You're a Kitty.\\
107 - Yes, I am, Frank.\\
108 - And what are you?\\
109 - Bum. I'm a bum!\\
110 - And I knew that.\\
111 - Red, honey, um...\\
112 - I could
use some help here.\\
113 - Gee, Kitty,\\
114 - I'd really like to help you out,\\
115 - but we gotta take these out
to the garage and get plowed!\\
116 - He is such a good boy.\\
117 - Hello.\\
118 - Oh, hi, Dr. Farrell.\\
119 - Hmm.\\
120 - Really?\\
121 - Oh, my God.\\
122 - Oh!\\
123 - Oh! Thank you.\\
124 - Thank you, Doctor.\\
125 - Yeah. Thank you.\\
126 - Wrong number.\\
127 - Oh, God.\\
128 - No!\\
129 - You're pregnant.\\
130 - Yes, I am.\\
131 - Do you know who the father is?\\
132 - You know what I hear is nice?\\
133 - Florida.\\
134 - Look at this dump.\\
135 - No wonder Hyde
tried to burn it down.\\
136 - You know, Fez,\\
137 - a man died in that fire.\\
138 - A gym teacher.\\
139 - Coach...\\
140 - Smith.\\
141 - Some say his specter\\
142 - still roams the halls
to this day.\\
143 - Take a la-a-a-p...\\
144 - Give me 20.\\
145 - Walk it of-f-f-f...\\
146 - All right, guys,
let's just cut it out, okay?\\
147 - You're scaring the women.\\
148 - Out of my way!\\
149 - Kelso, it was the window.\\
150 - Yeah, I knew that.\\
151 - Out of my way?\\
152 - No, I didn't say that.\\
153 - Yes, you did, just before
you knocked her over.\\
154 - No. I... I was
protecting you.\\
155 - Protecting me?\\
156 - Yeah. I was trying
to draw the ghosts\\
157 - away from you.\\
158 - Ghosts are attracted
to movement.\\
159 - That's a scientific fact.\\
160 - You know what?
I don't care.\\
161 - You're an idiot,
and science is stupid!\\
162 - Donna, let's go.\\
163 - Gee, wonder what
we're gonna talk about.\\
164 - You're doomed!\\
165 - God, I can't believe\\
166 - Michael pushed me
out of the way like that.\\
167 - Me neither. I figured he'd
use you as a human shield.\\
168 - Donna, the most noble thing
a man can do\\
169 - is lay down his life
for a woman he loves.\\
170 - Ideally, while she's still
young and can remarry.\\
171 - Do you know
who protected me there?\\
172 - Fez.\\
173 - Well, he had to.
He's Batman.\\
174 - And the man said,\\
175 - "Here's your daughter's sweater.\\
176 - "She left it
in my car last night."\\
177 - And the woman said,\\
178 - "Why, that's impossible.\\
179 - "My daughter died 10 years ago\\
180 - "wearing that\\
181 - "very\\
182 - "sweater."\\
183 - So?\\
184 - So, she was dead.\\
185 - And...
He gave her a ride.\\
186 - And she was dead!\\
187 - When I was six,\\
188 - the mayor of our town
was hung from a tree.\\
189 - Your story was not scary.\\
190 - Not scary?\\
191 - The ghost of a dead girl
gave him her sweater.\\
192 - What does a ghost need
with a sweater, man?\\
193 - Maybe it's to keep her guts
from falling out.\\
194 - You can tell it was not scary\\
195 - because Michael-ina here\\
196 - did not run screaming
for the door.\\
197 - Hey. Where is it written\\
198 - that a guy has to protect
his girl? Huh?\\
199 - And I'll have you know that
the feminine form of my name\\
200 - is Michelle.\\
201 - Look, Michelle,\\
202 - I don't want to come out
in favor of saving Jackie,\\
203 - but that's the price you pay\\
204 - for docking your love
boat in Jackie-Vallarta.\\
205 - Okay.\\
206 - So Ichabod Crane\\
207 - lived in the village
of Sleepy Hollow...\\
208 - Wait, don't tell me.\\
209 - He left his jacket somewhere.\\
210 - Okay, that's it.\\
211 - Halloween's over.\\
212 - There's just... There's
nothing that scares us anymore.\\
213 - Hey, guys, we found
something scary.\\
214 - Yeah, it was in
the principal's office.\\
215 - Oh, my God.\\
216 - Those look like...\\
217 - Like...\\
218 - They are.\\
219 - Our permanent records.\\
220 - Wow!\\
221 - Our permanent records.\\
222 - Uh, you know what?\\
223 - They probably left these here
after the school burned down.\\
224 - Hey.
Pinciotti, Donna.\\
225 - Well...\\
226 - Looks like someone we know
had a real hard time\\
227 - keeping their clothes on
in kindergarten.\\
228 - What?\\
229 - It was just a stupid phase.\\
230 - I'm sure glad that's over.\\
231 - Oh, listen to this.\\
232 - "I fear that despite
Steven's high IQ,\\
233 - "he's a born troublemaker\\
234 - "and is destined to be
the smartest man\\
235 - "in his cell block."\\
236 - What?\\
237 - They couldn't have known that
in second grade.\\
238 - "Steven willfully
and maliciously\\
239 - "destroyed Christine del Bueno's\\
240 - "shoe box diorama
of the four food groups."\\
241 - You're a monster.\\
242 - A horrible, horrible monster.\\
243 - Yeah, real funny,
but I didn't do it.\\
244 - You know what's
really funny, Hyde?\\
245 - What, Forman?\\
246 - Heh, heh.\\
247 - I broke the diorama.\\
248 - You?\\
249 - Hers was better than mine.\\
250 - I had to smash it.\\
251 - I left out dairy.\\
252 - You know, that's when
everybody turned against me.\\
253 - They pegged me as a bad kid.\\
254 - And once that happens,
you're labeled forever.\\
255 - You ruined my life, Forman.\\
256 - No he didn't.\\
257 - Hi. No offense,\\
258 - but with an alcoholic mom
and an absent dad,\\
259 - you were bound to end
up in jail sooner or later.\\
260 - I said, "No offense."\\
261 - Yeah, right.\\
262 - Let's see what that file
says about you, Jackie.\\
263 - Go ahead. I have
a perfect record.\\
264 - Would anybody like to know
what Jackie's middle name is?\\
265 - Jackie's middle name is...\\
266 - No!\\
267 - I hate you!\\
268 - Argh!\\
269 - It's Beulah.\\
270 - Trick or treat.\\
271 - Oh, you look so cute
in your little costumes.\\
272 - Arrrr!\\
273 - Damn, Frank, that's funny.\\
274 - Look, he lost his candy.\\
275 - Oh, that was not funny, Red.\\
276 - Those were just little kids.\\
277 - Well, that's what
makes it funny.\\
278 - Well, think about it, honey.\\
279 - Would it be funny
if it were your own kids?\\
280 - But I don't have kids.\\
281 - Well, you might.\\
282 - What are you saying?\\
283 - I'm saying...\\
284 - I'm pregnant.\\
285 - Oh, no!\\
286 - No, I mean, uh...\\
287 - Oh, crap.\\
288 - Yeah.\\
289 - All right, nobody move.\\
290 - Somebody took my last box
of Sugar Babies.\\
291 - Oh, no, wait.
I was sitting on them.\\
292 - Gee, Fez, you didn't
give Forman a chance\\
293 - to pin it on me.\\
294 - I didn't pin anything on you.\\
295 - No?\\
296 - Well, when Mrs. Hodgkiss\\
297 - was yelling at me
in front of the whole class,\\
298 - you didn't exactly step up
and take responsibility.\\
299 - What were you thinking?\\
300 - Hmm. I guess I was
thinking, "I'm seven!"\\
301 - Hey. Hey, hey!\\
302 - Let's not fight, all right?\\
303 - It's Halloween, man.\\
304 - It's time for peace on earth
and good will towards men.\\
305 - Let's read another file.\\
306 - Yeah, 'cause that's
working out great so far.\\
307 - All right, fine. I'll read
from my own, okay?\\
308 - Oh. Okay.\\
309 - Here's a secret you
guys don't know about me\\
310 - 'cause it happened the
year before I moved here.\\
311 - When I was in first grade,\\
312 - I used to wear this
red cape to school\\
313 - and pretend I was Superman.\\
314 - You must have looked
really stupid.\\
315 - Wait, wait, wait.
First grade?\\
316 - Yeah.\\
317 - No, no, no.
When you moved here,\\
318 - you and I were in first
grade. That's how we met.\\
319 - No, we didn't.\\
320 - Man, you had to repeat
first grade?\\
321 - Oh, my God!\\
322 - Michael, say it's not true.\\
323 - It was... It was cursive
writing, all right?\\
324 - All those stupid
squiggles and bumps.\\
325 - I wouldn't do it!\\
326 - You mean you couldn't do it.\\
327 - No! I wouldn't do it,\\
328 - and that's why
they held me back!\\
329 - Plus, I might have
killed the class bunny.\\
330 - Why?\\
331 - That's okay, Kelso.
Let it out.\\
332 - I mean, it sucked, you know?\\
333 - Living this lie,\\
334 - pretending to be a year
younger than I really am.\\
335 - Wait a minute.
You're 18?\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - That's why I've always\\
338 - seemed more mature
than you guys.\\
339 - Are you telling me\\
340 - that all this time\\
341 - you could have been
buying us beer?\\
342 - You bastard.\\
343 - What...\\
344 - No!\\
345 - It's not what you think.\\
346 - You're dead to me.\\
347 - But Eric ruined your life.\\
348 - And if I had a beer, I could
be getting over it right now.\\
349 - Beer!\\
350 - - Beer!
- Beer!\\
351 - All right, everybody,
just leave him alone!\\
352 - Okay? Because
he may be a liar,\\
353 - but at least he's not
a backstabber like Eric.\\
354 - Stay out of this, Beulah.\\
355 - Oh, don't call me that.\\
356 - Oh, sorry...\\
357 - Beulah.\\
358 - Fine.\\
359 - You know what?\\
360 - Donna kissed Hyde last year.\\
361 - What?\\
362 - Don't mess with me.\\
363 - That...\\
364 - That's a lie.
Hyde kissed me.\\
365 - Well, that is just
so much better.\\
366 - How... How could you
do this, man?\\
367 - I guess I'm just
a born troublemaker.\\
368 - Or maybe you turned me into one.\\
369 - You are so dead, Beulah.\\
370 - Hey! Leave her alone,
all right?\\
371 - Okay. Yeah.\\
372 - Jackie told me
Fez was a better kisser\\
373 - than you, Kelso.\\
374 - Ahhh!\\
375 - Were you ever
gonna tell me about Hyde?\\
376 - It hurts when your friends
stab you in the back, don't it?\\
377 - How would I know?\\
378 - I have no friends!\\
379 - Let's go, pal!\\
380 - Stop it!\\
381 - Can't you see what is happening?\\
382 - Those permanent records
are tearing us apart.\\
383 - Batman's right.\\
384 - Look what we've become.\\
385 - We're like animals.\\
386 - Those files are evil, man.\\
387 - We've got to destroy them.\\
388 - But how, Jackie?\\
389 - How?\\
390 - Oh, my God.\\
391 - Now my Sugar Babies
really are gone.\\
392 - Kitty.\\
393 - I'm really sorry
about what I said.\\
394 - You mean, "Oh, no,"\\
395 - and "crap"?\\
396 - Right, that's it.\\
397 - I'm sorry. I...\\
398 - It's just...\\
399 - It was a big shock, you know?\\
400 - It was a really big shock
for me, too,\\
401 - and I said, "Oh, good"
and "Yay."\\
402 - No, I...
I feel like that, too.\\
403 - It's just that I...\\
404 - Well, I...\\
405 - I needed a minute
for it to sink in.\\
406 - But once it sunk in,\\
407 - I realized I was really happy.\\
408 - You really mean that?\\
409 - Of course I do.\\
410 - It's gonna be great.\\
411 - I can't wait to be a father.\\
412 - Hey, Red!\\
413 - Great news!
I found a way\\
414 - to drink beer faster! Come on!\\
415 - Go home, Frank.\\
416 - I'm busy.\\
417 - Okay. Yeah.\\
418 - Oh, wow.\\
419 - I think you're maturing.\\
420 - Well...\\
421 - You know, the truth is...\\
422 - Frank's getting on
my nerves a little bit.\\
423 - I mean, he's...
He's kind of...\\
424 - He's an ass.\\
425 - And he's dumb.\\
426 - He's a...\\
427 - Dumb-ass.\\
428 - Hey.\\
429 - Come here.\\
430 - And then you gave birth\\
431 - - to a beautiful
daughter.
- Uh-huh.\\
432 - And then Eric.\\
433 - Who is just wonderful.\\
434 - And I've grown up
a lot since then.\\
435 - Oh, you're dead, kid!\\
436 - Michael, I'm cold.\\
437 - And this is stupid.\\
438 - We should just burn the files.\\
439 - Jackie, they've already
been in a fire.\\
440 - They can't be destroyed
that way.\\
441 - See you in hell,
permanent records.\\
442 - Now we have to swear we'll
never speak of this ever again.\\
443 - Except the part about
Kelso buying us beer.\\
444 - Yeah, naturally.\\
445 - But otherwise it's like this
night never happened, okay?\\
446 - Beulah.\\
447 - No!\\
448 - No!\\
449 - No!\\
450 - Ahhh!\\
451 - Mmm.\\
452 - Stolen Sugar Babies.
\subsection {Episode 06: Vanstock}
1 - Hey, Dad, can I go to Vanstock
with the guys this weekend?\\
2 - What the hell's a Vanstock?\\
3 - Well, it's like Woodstock,\\
4 - but with a greater
emphasis on vans.\\
5 - Sounds stupid.\\
6 - Have a good time.\\
7 - Oh, then, Daddy, since Eric
is going out of town,\\
8 - can I have his car?\\
9 - Why? where are you going?\\
10 - Excuse me, I was
talking to Daddy.\\
11 - I know.
Where are you going?\\
12 - - Frat party.
- Frat party? No.\\
13 - - But, Daddy...
- Look, honey, it's up to Eric.\\
14 - Really?\\
15 - Well, I mean, I guess...\\
16 - No!\\
17 - Well, that's settled, then.\\
18 - Red, what are you
gonna do today?\\
19 - Read the want ads,
look for a job.\\
20 - Then, just to break up the day,\\
21 - I thought I'd go down to Rexall,
look for some Gold Bond\\
22 - for my athlete's foot.\\
23 - Any more questions?\\
24 - Well, oh, boy, Red,\\
25 - we've got the big hospital
banquet to look forward to.\\
26 - Oh, right. Well then...\\
27 - Screw the gold bond,
I gotta get my hair done.\\
28 - Well, honey, I don't think
it's gonna be that bad.\\
29 - And... if it is,\\
30 - I can always give you
a shot of Demerol.\\
31 - You have Demerol?\\
32 - I mean, what's... what's Demerol?\\
33 - Hangin' out\\
34 - Down the street\\
35 - The same old thing\\
36 - We did last week\\
37 - Not a thing to do\\
38 - But talk to you\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
42 - So, Donna and I are
all set for Vanstock.\\
43 - Whoa. Donna can't
come with us.\\
44 - Why not?\\
45 - Well... it's kind of
complicated.\\
46 - Hey, Kelso.\\
47 - So what time are we
leaving for Vanstock?\\
48 - - No. No!
- Yeah. Yeah!\\
49 - No!\\
50 - I guess you should have
given me your car, Eric.\\
51 - Now I'll be with you
and Kelso all weekend.\\
52 - How could you ask Laurie?\\
53 - Well, Jackie didn't want to go.\\
54 - What choice did I have?\\
55 - Oh, man.\\
56 - See, now you see my problem.\\
57 - Since Laurie's going,\\
58 - I'm gonna have to
make out with her.\\
59 - And if Donna goes, she's gonna
see me making out with Laurie\\
60 - and then tell Jackie,
therefore, Donna can't go.\\
61 - Or... you could just not
make out with my sister.\\
62 - Be serious, Eric.\\
63 - OK, look.
Donna's coming,\\
64 - and if that blows your weekend,
then... too bad.\\
65 - Fine. But you know what?\\
66 - You're making cheating
a lot harder than it has to be.\\
67 - Kitty and I used to watch
the soaps all the time.\\
68 - So now, it's like you're Kitty.\\
69 - Don't you have a TV at home?\\
70 - It's too big.\\
71 - I have to turn my head
to see who's talking.\\
72 - It hurts my neck.\\
73 - Ooh, shh, shh.
It's starting.\\
74 - OK, that's Heather.\\
75 - She's carrying Jeff's baby,
only Jeff is in intensive care.\\
76 - He's got a bullet in his brain.\\
77 - Isn't he the lucky bastard.\\
78 - Donna, check it out.\\
79 - I've been working on this
all morning,\\
80 - and I'm really proud.\\
81 - I zipped our two sleeping
bags together to make one.\\
82 - Look, throw your stuff
in the back.\\
83 - I'm gonna go get some
snacks for the road.\\
84 - OK.\\
85 - Oh. Hi. Donna.\\
86 - So, that's the carpet.\\
87 - I was just showing
Laurie the carpet.\\
88 - - I need help with my stuff.
- I'm gonna give her
some help with her stuff.\\
89 - I hope you like
tuna fish sandwiches\\
90 - 'cause that's all we got.\\
91 - I just saw Kelso and your sister\\
92 - making out in the van.\\
93 - Oh, no, that's, uh...\\
94 - Did you know about this?\\
95 - Did I? Uh, no.\\
96 - No, I didn't know about this.\\
97 - Hey, hi.\\
98 - Donna just saw Kelso
and Laurie making out.\\
99 - So?\\
100 - Aren't you shocked? I'm shocked,
for one, to have learned about this.\\
101 - Hey, guys.
I decided to go.\\
102 - I thought it'd be fun
to surprise Michael.\\
103 - That would be fun.\\
104 - Um, Jackie, look,
before you surprise Kelso,\\
105 - there's something going on
that you should know.\\
106 - What?\\
107 - You know, Vanstock is
gonna be really boring,\\
108 - and it's gonna be muddy,\\
109 - and there's a good chance
there'll be some Canadians there.\\
110 - Eew!\\
111 - No, no, Jackie, you should go.\\
112 - You can't let the Canadians win.\\
113 - Fez, put my stuff in the back.\\
114 - Hey, Jackie...\\
115 - ...you know what'd be the
perfect surprise for Kelso?\\
116 - We'll pull the curtains,\\
117 - and you hide
in the back with us.\\
118 - And at some point,\\
119 - you jump up front
and yell, "surprise!"\\
120 - Oh, my God, that is perfect!\\
121 - Now, hop in the van
before Kelso sees you.\\
122 - Hurry up.\\
123 - Oh, this may be
the best road trip ever.\\
124 - So, you want to shift?\\
125 - It's an automatic.\\
126 - I know.\\
127 - - Surprise!
- Aah!\\
128 - Brad, how
could you sleep with my wife?\\
129 - You're my brother.\\
130 - I'm not your
brother. And I'm not Brad.\\
131 - Holy cow.\\
132 - I didn't see that coming.\\
133 - Wait till Rachel finds out.\\
134 - But Rachel's about
to dump Brad for Jeff.\\
135 - No! Jeff's in a coma.\\
136 - Oh, come one, Midge.\\
137 - She can't love a guy in a coma?\\
138 - What the hell
kind of love is that?\\
139 - Look at this. Jackie brings
four different types of mascara\\
140 - just to please Kelso.\\
141 - And what does Kelso bring?
Another woman.\\
142 - Fez, you should really stop
going through other people's stuff.\\
143 - It's kind of creepy.\\
144 - So, how long do you think this
whole thing has been going on?\\
145 - Whoo. I... you know,
I don't know.\\
146 - That's anyone's guess.
Right, Fez?\\
147 - - What?
- Kelso and Laurie.\\
148 - See? Fez doesn't even know.
I don't know...\\
149 - I gue... you know,
it's just... it's like...\\
150 - God, this is so wrong, you know?\\
151 - So what are we gonna do?\\
152 - Well, I guess just
let this all blow over,\\
153 - and then Jackie and Kelso
can get married,\\
154 - have kids,
and be really unhappy.\\
155 - So... let's not this ruin our
Vanstock experience, OK?\\
156 - Look at this.
Bubble gum lip smacker.\\
157 - What a waste.\\
158 - So, you kids having fun?\\
159 - Nothing like a road trip
to get to know each other.\\
160 - Yeah. Right.\\
161 - Like Jackie and Laurie.\\
162 - They don't really
know each other,\\
163 - and yet, they have
so much in common.\\
164 - Like what?\\
165 - Oh, well, you both have
really neat hair.\\
166 - He's right.
I love your hair.\\
167 - - What do you use?
- Hot rollers.\\
168 - So do I!
I hate styling wands.\\
169 - So do I!\\
170 - See?
You two keep talking.\\
171 - There may be plenty of other
things that you have in common.\\
172 - No! No talking.\\
173 - It makes the driver nervous.\\
174 - So just everybody not talk.\\
175 - OK.\\
176 - Let's just sing songs.\\
177 - Who knows the words to
Three's Company?\\
178 - - I do.
- I do.\\
179 - No singing.\\
180 - Come and knock
on our door\\
181 - Come and knock
on our door\\
182 - We've been
Waiting for you\\
183 - We've been waiting
for you\\
184 - Where the kisses are
hers and hers and his\\
185 - Three's company, too\\
186 - Wow, man. Vanstock.\\
187 - It's exactly how I pictured it.\\
188 - Has anyone seen my top?\\
189 - I lost my top.\\
190 - Actually, it's even better
than I pictured it.\\
191 - Do not take the blue acid!\\
192 - If you have taken the blue acid,\\
193 - please, report to
the Red Cross tent!\\
194 - Look at this debauchery.\\
195 - This is the smelly underside
of a once great nation.\\
196 - Ooh, yum, candy apples.\\
197 - Hey, man.\\
198 - What do you say we help
that chick find her top?\\
199 - Nah. I gotta stay here with
the old balls and chains.\\
200 - You know, Kelso,\\
201 - did you ever think about
being honest with them?\\
202 - Maybe they won't be mad.\\
203 - Maybe they'll like
the idea of sharing you.\\
204 - Man, that'd be great, huh?\\
205 - You think they'd go for that?\\
206 - 'Cause that's been...\\
207 - Oh, no.\\
208 - You're trying to
set me up, Hyde.\\
209 - You never know
if you don't try, man.\\
210 - Are you serious?\\
211 - Be serious.
'cause this is serious.\\
212 - This has been a dream of
mine since I was a kid\\
213 - and saw The Parent Trap.\\
214 - There you go.\\
215 - OK, we're heading off
to the restroom.\\
216 - OK.\\
217 - Whoa, man, they're
going to the restroom?\\
218 - You know what girls do
in the restroom, right?\\
219 - Oh. I like to pretend
like they don't do that.\\
220 - Not that, man.
They talk.\\
221 - - So?
- To each other.\\
222 - Oh, my God.
Girls, wait up!\\
223 - What a maroon.\\
224 - So, Red, this is Dr. Browning
and, uh, Dr. Cloke.\\
225 - So you're Kitty's husband, eh?\\
226 - She's a little spitfire.\\
227 - We couldn't run
the ward without her.\\
228 - Oh... well, you could,
but everyone would die.\\
229 - Oh, so, Red, what do you do?\\
230 - About what?\\
231 - Um, Red used to be in management\\
232 - at the auto parts plant.\\
233 - Oh, that's great.
What do you do now?\\
234 - About what?\\
235 - Oh, oh, my gosh, Red, look,
they have an open bar.\\
236 - No, he's not his brother.\\
237 - He's not even Brad.\\
238 - But he looks just like him.\\
239 - That's the point.\\
240 - You know, I don't
understand why you watch\\
241 - if you're not gonna
pay attention.\\
242 - I'm sorry about Red.\\
243 - He's just... He's been a tiny
bit cranky since he lost his job.\\
244 - - Kitty, it's fine.
- I know, everything's fine.\\
245 - He just, um, he sits around
and he mopes all day.\\
246 - He once told me that if he ever started
watching soaps, I should shoot him.\\
247 - And I gotta tell you,
I am gosh-darned tempted.\\
248 - Well, you know,
when my wife is upset,\\
249 - I do something
extra special for her,\\
250 - like surprise her
with some candy.\\
251 - Does red have a sweet tooth?\\
252 - Um, no. No, um,
more of a beer tooth.\\
253 - Oh, for God's sakes,\\
254 - you're a nurse and you
can't love a guy in a coma?\\
255 - What the hell kind
of a hospital is this?\\
256 - Wow, look at the stars.\\
257 - Yeah. Your sister's
kind of a slut.\\
258 - I noticed that.\\
259 - How is it that
she turned out so awful\\
260 - and you turned out so nice?\\
261 - Oh, well...\\
262 - You see...\\
263 - OK, Donna, there's
something you should know.\\
264 - Oh, my God, you're pregnant.\\
265 - It's nice to laugh, isn't it?\\
266 - 'Cause I kind of knew about
Kelso and Laurie all along\\
267 - and didn't tell you.\\
268 - - Excuse me?
- Which was wrong.\\
269 - But now I'm being honest,
which is right... right?\\
270 - - Get out of this bag.
- No, wait, Donna, just...\\
271 - Fine, I'll get out.\\
272 - Oh, this is the worst
Vanstock ever.\\
273 - And now, another
episode of Point Place.\\
274 - My God, Kitty...\\
275 - ...what have I become?\\
276 - I don't know.\\
277 - You're not the man I married.\\
278 - And I'm not Kitty.\\
279 - What are you saying?\\
280 - I am Kitty.\\
281 - But I am leaving you
for Dr. Cloke.\\
282 - Or should I say...\\
283 - ...Eric's real father.\\
284 - - But why?
- He has a job.\\
285 - What do you have, Red Forman?\\
286 - What... do... you... have?\\
287 - I've got nothing.\\
288 - Dear God,
will I ever work again?\\
289 - OK, I'm back.\\
290 - So... penny for your thoughts.\\
291 - Well... one thing I'm thinking,\\
292 - I gotta stop watching the soaps.\\
293 - Well, I think
that is a good idea.\\
294 - So, listen, um,\\
295 - I brought you home
a special little treat.\\
296 - Oh...\\
297 - Ahh...\\
298 - Hey... that's a nice beer.\\
299 - Yes, it is.\\
300 - What's the occasion?\\
301 - It's, um...\\
302 - ...to celebrate your new job.\\
303 - But, Kitty, I didn't get a job.\\
304 - Not yet, but I know you will.\\
305 - Thanks, sweetie.\\
306 - Ahh...\\
307 - Tell you one thing...
I bet I get a job\\
308 - before Jeff gets
out of that coma.\\
309 - Hey. How's it going?\\
310 - Well, uh... found the top,
just lost the girl.\\
311 - Bummer.\\
312 - Yeah. What are you
doing up?\\
313 - Punishing Eric.\\
314 - He knew all about Kelso and
Laurie, didn't even tell me.\\
315 - What a bastard.\\
316 - Oh, like you didn't know.\\
317 - Of course I knew.
Everybody knew.\\
318 - You're the only one
who didn't know.\\
319 - Shut up, Hyde, I'm mad at him.\\
320 - Look, you don't rat
on your friends,\\
321 - and that's just the way it is.\\
322 - Now, I'm laying
traps left and right\\
323 - to try and get Kelso caught,\\
324 - but I'm not gonna tell on him,
'cause then I'd be a rat.\\
325 - And that's what Forman would
have been if he had told you.\\
326 - He still should've told me.\\
327 - Give him a break, Donna.\\
328 - I mean, the guy kisses your ass.\\
329 - He does everything for you,\\
330 - and you're not even
sleeping with him.\\
331 - Yeah, I guess that's true.\\
332 - You're lucky
he even talks to you.\\
333 - In fact, I would've
dumped you months ago.\\
334 - But, you know,
I'm old-fashioned, so...\\
335 - OK, Hyde, thanks
for the heart-to-heart.\\
336 - Ah, get bent.\\
337 - All right, well,\\
338 - I'm off to find the jugs
that fit this top.\\
339 - Like Cinderella.\\
340 - Excuse me, miss?\\
341 - Yeah, who is it?\\
342 - It's me.\\
343 - Hey, Jackie...
Laurie...\\
344 - Fez.\\
345 - Good evening, Michael.\\
346 - Well, aren't we all cozy?\\
347 - Hm. So, where
am I gonna sleep?\\
348 - Uh, gee, Kelso, I don't
think there's any room.\\
349 - But it's my van.\\
350 - I can sleep with you anytime.\\
351 - Tonight, I'm really enjoying
girl talk with Laurie.\\
352 - Then why does he get to stay?\\
353 - Well, I'm not a girl,
but I do enjoy the girl talk.\\
354 - Get out of the van, Fez!\\
355 - No, be nice to Fez.
Go away, Michael.\\
356 - Shut the door.\\
357 - Aah!\\
358 - Hey, move over.\\
359 - You're not mad at me anymore?\\
360 - Nope.\\
361 - So... what are you thinking?\\
362 - That Kelso's an idiot,\\
363 - and if I say anything to
Jackie, it'll hurt her.\\
364 - Yes, exactly.\\
365 - And you know what else?\\
366 - You're, like, a really
great boyfriend.\\
367 - All right!\\
368 - Whoa. All right.\\
369 - Thank God I found you guys.
I'm freezing. Scoot over.\\
370 - What? Kelso, no!\\
371 - Wow, this is a roomy bag, huh?\\
372 - Sorry if I'm a little wet.\\
373 - What the hell is that smell?\\
374 - Oh, I found these two dogs,
and we started wrestling.\\
375 - They were so cool.\\
376 - All right, good night.\\
377 - No, Kelso, get out!\\
378 - - Get out!
- You smell like a dog.\\
379 - You smell. Get out.\\
380 - Well, where am I
supposed to sleep?\\
381 - No one cares.\\
382 - Fine!\\
383 - OK, this is nice.\\
384 - Will Red get a job?\\
385 - Will Jackie ever find out
about Kelso and Laurie?\\
386 - Will we ever find out
where Fez is from?\\
387 - Will Hyde ever find
his topless Cinderella?\\
388 - And what ever happened
to Midge's daughter Tina?\\
389 - Will Eric and Donna\\
390 - ever consummate their
illicit teenage love?\\
391 - And what about Chuck and Bob?\\
392 - Oh, wait, they aren't
on this show.\\
393 - See, I told you
we weren't on this show.\\
394 - Oh, shut up, Bob.\\
395 - Confused?\\
396 - You won't be after
the next episode of...\\
397 - That '70s Show.
\subsection {Episode 07: I Love Cake}
1 - Oh, my God.\\
2 - Did you hear that?\\
3 - It sounds like a bloody hook\\
4 - scraping against the back door.\\
5 - What's... What's wrong?
You're like a million miles away.\\
6 - I don't know.
It's just that my parents\\
7 - are fighting like, all the time.\\
8 - It just makes me so mad.\\
9 - Like I want to kick
their asses, but I can't.\\
10 - But I want to do something.\\
11 - Okay.\\
12 - Take me, Donna.\\
13 - What?\\
14 - Go ahead.
Take me.\\
15 - Punish your parents
by using me for sex.\\
16 - Do your business and be done
with it. Go ahead. Don't be shy.\\
17 - I can take it.\\
18 - But... God,
do be gentle.\\
19 - You didn't actually think
that was gonna work, did you?\\
20 - No, but I'm a virgin,
and it's driving me crazy.\\
21 - But that's not your
fault... No, wait. Yes, it is.\\
22 - How do you do that?\\
23 - Do what?\\
24 - You always make me feel better.\\
25 - Uh... Well,
thank you.\\
26 - I love you, Eric.\\
27 - I love cake.\\
28 - Hangin' out\\
29 - Down the street\\
30 - The same old thing\\
31 - We did last week\\
32 - Not a thing to do\\
33 - But talk to you\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
37 - Morning, Bob.\\
38 - Morning, Red.\\
39 - Probably wondering
why I'm in your car, huh?\\
40 - No.\\
41 - Just get out
and have a nice day.\\
42 - Midgie and I got into a
fight, Red, and I walked out.\\
43 - Guess that'll teach her, right?\\
44 - Well, you're the one
sleeping in the car, Bob.\\
45 - Right. Well, that's 'cause
when I stormed out,\\
46 - I sort of forgot some stuff.\\
47 - You know, keys,
wallet, blow dryer.\\
48 - All I need now
is a place to stay.\\
49 - Maybe with some friends.\\
50 - Well, uh...\\
51 - We don't, uh, have
a blow dryer, Bob.\\
52 - Laurie's got a blow dryer.\\
53 - I know 'cause she's got
that Farrah Fawcett hairdo.\\
54 - That's not natural.\\
55 - You... You know, I wouldn't
even need my own room.\\
56 - Just a little corner
to sleep in.\\
57 - Oh, cripes.\\
58 - Okay.\\
59 - Oh, thanks, Red.\\
60 - You're my best friend.\\
61 - No, I'm not.\\
62 - Do you think when
girls have sleepovers,\\
63 - sometimes, they, they
play games and giggle,\\
64 - and then, every once in a while,\\
65 - they start to make out all
together in a big naked heap?\\
66 - I sure hope so.
Me, too.\\
67 - May I have
your attention, please?\\
68 - I would like
to introduce to you all,\\
69 - the new Michael Kelso!\\
70 - Yeah.\\
71 - So, huh, what do you think?\\
72 - Yeah. Jackie says it
makes me look like\\
73 - Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones.\\
74 - Yeah. I'm so Brando.\\
75 - Yeah, if Brando had
a buddy named Potsie.\\
76 - What are you even saying?\\
77 - Jackie, did you dress
me up like The Fonz?\\
78 - No, Michael, I did not
dress you up like The Fonz.\\
79 - Although, I mean,
I like The Fonz.\\
80 - I think, he's, you
know, kind of... Fez!\\
81 - Fonz? Yes or no?\\
82 - Well, you know me, Kelso.\\
83 - I just want you to be happy.\\
84 - Thank you, Fez.\\
85 - Now, if I could just have
a moment of your time.\\
86 - Sure.\\
87 - Good, yes.\\
88 - Okay, a gang of toughs has
taken over Arnold's.\\
89 - Help us, Fonzie.
You're our only hope!\\
90 - I can't believe you guys.\\
91 - Here I am as Brando as can be,\\
92 - and you guys
can't even see that.\\
93 - Well, you can both just...\\
94 - Sit on it?\\
95 - Michael!\\
96 - Why is Bob in my bathtub?\\
97 - You told me you sent him home.\\
98 - That's what you said,
"He went home."\\
99 - He did go home...\\
100 - And then Midge kicked him out.\\
101 - But he went home.\\
102 - Well, now he's back.\\
103 - Red, he's in my bathtub.\\
104 - I can't have him in my bathtub.\\
105 - His Afro gel is
gonna leave a ring.\\
106 - This isn't easy
on me, either, Kitty.\\
107 - He tried to talk to me
about his feelings.\\
108 - He almost started to cry.\\
109 - I really wanted to punch him!\\
110 - Bob can't stay here, Red.\\
111 - I know that makes me
a bad person.\\
112 - I don't care. I'm bad, so
let's just get him out of here!\\
113 - Well, then go talk to Midge
and fix it up.\\
114 - You let the stray in.\\
115 - You find him a home.\\
116 - It's not that simple, Kitty.\\
117 - Do you want me to go
to my unhappy place, Red?\\
118 - I'll talk to Midge
first thing in the morning.\\
119 - Thank you, Red. You're
a wonderful husband.\\
120 - Now, when you're
done with the paper,\\
121 - you get upstairs
and scrub my tub.\\
122 - Okay. You're done!\\
123 - I won't do it.\\
124 - Well, I won't, either.\\
125 - Well, I don't know
what the hell we're gonna do.\\
126 - Ah, Kelso, it was brave
of you to come back.\\
127 - We gave you quite a ribbing.\\
128 - Yeah...\\
129 - Except for this time,\\
130 - I brought a hot, fresh pizza.\\
131 - But it's only for my friends
who don't make fun of me.\\
132 - Mmm! Pizza!\\
133 - Kelso, man, I got 1,000 insults,\\
134 - and no pizza's gonna make...\\
135 - Is that sausage?\\
136 - You brilliant bastard!\\
137 - Guys, let me ask you something.\\
138 - Donna told me she loves me,\\
139 - and then I told her,
"I love cake."\\
140 - That's not bad, is it?\\
141 - I'm still cool, right?\\
142 - Okay. I don't know
what happened.\\
143 - I just panicked,
and it popped out.\\
144 - I mean, I don't remember
wanting to ever talk about cake.\\
145 - I wasn't really that hungry.\\
146 - Cake is good,\\
147 - but you cannot have
sex with cake.\\
148 - Of course, you cannot have
sex with Donna, either, so...\\
149 - Yeah, man.\\
150 - You should've just lied and
told her that you loved her.\\
151 - "I love you, baby."\\
152 - See? And I don't love you.
Isn't that great?\\
153 - He does love her, you dope.\\
154 - Right?\\
155 - Okay. Well, if I admit it, are
you guys gonna make fun of me?\\
156 - Oh, Eric.
Love is not a joke.\\
157 - This is a joke, knock, knock.\\
158 - Who's there?\\
159 - Look, if you really do love her,\\
160 - there's only one thing
to do, man.\\
161 - You gotta dump her
and live free!\\
162 - Don't listen to him, man.
He's stupid.\\
163 - Here's what you gotta do,\\
164 - she said it,
so now you gotta say it.\\
165 - Then she'll say it back,
and everything will be okay.\\
166 - Oh, and get her pizza.\\
167 - 'Cause right now
I kinda love Kelso.\\
168 - Yeah, I can do that.\\
169 - I'll just say it, and I'll be
back on top again. All right.\\
170 - So now, uh...\\
171 - Where was I when Fonzie here
moved to town?\\
172 - Hey!\\
173 - Give that backamundo!\\
174 - Eric...\\
175 - Eric, are you okay?\\
176 - What? Yeah.\\
177 - You look like you have
a stomachache or something.\\
178 - No.\\
179 - There's nothing wrong
with my stomach.\\
180 - It's just that...\\
181 - I love you...\\
182 - Man.\\
183 - And then he punched me
in the arm and said, "Man!"\\
184 - Oh, my God.\\
185 - What a horrible disaster.\\
186 - Well, go on!\\
187 - I guess I, like, totally
screwed things up.\\
188 - 'Cause ever since I said, "I love
you," he's been acting so weird.\\
189 - Okay, wait a second.
I'm a little confused.\\
190 - Why did you say, "I love you"?\\
191 - Because I love him?\\
192 - Oh! Donna, that's got
nothing to do with it!\\
193 - You are way too young
to be saying, "I love you."\\
194 - Shut up, Jackie. You
say it to Kelso all the time,\\
195 - and you're, like,
younger than me.\\
196 - Not in love years.\\
197 - All right, look, Eric doesn't know
how to handle that kind of thing.\\
198 - You probably just
scared him off.\\
199 - All you can do right now
is play it cool for a while,\\
200 - turn down the emotional heat,\\
201 - and, Donna, God willing, he'll
forget you threw yourself at him.\\
202 - I know it sounds impossible,\\
203 - but what you just said
actually makes sense.\\
204 - Look, the sooner you realize I'm a
genius, the better off we'll both be.\\
205 - Oh. Hi, Red.\\
206 - Sorry I can't open the door,\\
207 - but I don't want Bob sneaking
back in the house again.\\
208 - Oh.\\
209 - That's okay. I just came by
to see how you're doing.\\
210 - Oh, I'm working through
some things.\\
211 - Gotten past denial and I'm
well on my way to acceptance...\\
212 - Yeah, yeah. Couldn't agree
with you more. Anyway...\\
213 - Take Bob back.\\
214 - Red, I can't do that right now.\\
215 - Midge, I've talked to Bob,
and he's really sorry.\\
216 - Now, be a sport and
take him back. I can't.\\
217 - Take him back, Midge!
No!\\
218 - Take him!
No!\\
219 - This isn't over, Pinciotti!\\
220 - Hey, Donna, check it out.\\
221 - Hey, Kelso!\\
222 - Fudgsicle!\\
223 - Where'd it go?\\
224 - Um... Perhaps it went
under the couch.\\
225 - Jackie, let's get out of
here. This is kinda lame.\\
226 - Yeah, sure.\\
227 - Wait! Donna...\\
228 - So will I see you later?\\
229 - No.\\
230 - No. You're never gonna
see me again.\\
231 - Ha!\\
232 - She's a little
pistol, huh?\\
233 - What did you do?\\
234 - Nothing! I did
what you said.\\
235 - I told her I loved her.\\
236 - You're lying.\\
237 - No, it's true, except...\\
238 - Except...\\
239 - And I might've, you know...\\
240 - Popped her one on the
shoulder and called her, "Man."\\
241 - You idiot.\\
242 - Hey, this isn't my fault.\\
243 - It's your fault! You said
if I told her I loved her,\\
244 - she'd say it back, but she
didn't, man. She just stared at me.\\
245 - Well, did you give her
a chance to answer?\\
246 - How long did you wait before
you completely muffed out?\\
247 - Forever, man.\\
248 - Like, five minutes.\\
249 - You're lying!\\
250 - No. It's true.
It was like...\\
251 - Well, maybe just a
couple seconds, but I...\\
252 - Time ceased to exist, okay?\\
253 - I was just hangin' out there,
really far out there. Just...\\
254 - Hangin'.\\
255 - Eric contributes in class,
but does not follow directions.\\
256 - Damn! Where the heck
is that fudgsicle!\\
257 - Hey...\\
258 - Is that my fudgsicle?\\
259 - No. This one's mine.\\
260 - Damn it.
Where's my fudgsicle?\\
261 - Just tell me. How am I
supposed to fix this?\\
262 - Well, first of all...\\
263 - You need to learn how to
handle a little woman troubles\\
264 - without getting all freaked out.\\
265 - It's pretty unmanly, man.\\
266 - Laurie.\\
267 - That's it!
I hate this stupid thing!\\
268 - Laurie laughing at me.\\
269 - But, Kelso, I thought we were supposed
to handle our woman troubles "like a man"?\\
270 - - You shut up.
- Okay.\\
271 - You just shut up!\\
272 - And if anybody else here
laughs at me,\\
273 - I swear I'm gonna
kick so much ass!\\
274 - And that's my fudgsicle.\\
275 - I'm telling you, man, that jacket's
the best thing ever happened to us.\\
276 - I can't do it now,
Kitty. He's sleeping.\\
277 - Bob!\\
278 - Oh, Bob, you're awake.\\
279 - Hi.\\
280 - Let's see.
It was, uh...\\
281 - It was a no-go with Midge.\\
282 - She doesn't wanna see you.\\
283 - Boy, that's a shame, Red.\\
284 - Guess it's you and me, buddy.\\
285 - Well, that's a problem.\\
286 - I like you, Bob.\\
287 - You don't borrow my things,
you keep your lawn mowed.\\
288 - But the fact of the matter
is, you're a little bit...\\
289 - You're kind of a...\\
290 - You're an ass.\\
291 - Yeah?\\
292 - Well, it's not your fault.\\
293 - Well we gotta stop
pussyfooting' around here\\
294 - and somehow get you
back in that house.\\
295 - How?\\
296 - Oh. It's you.\\
297 - I'm not taking him back, Red.
No, no, no, no.\\
298 - I'm just gonna trim a few
of these branches for you.\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - Help!\\
301 - Midge, I'm trapped under
this very heavy branch!\\
302 - Help!
Oh, my God! Red!\\
303 - Are you hurt?\\
304 - Go, Bob, go!\\
305 - I'm in!
Oh!\\
306 - Red, that was not nice.\\
307 - I'm not sorry, Midge.\\
308 - Great shot.\\
309 - And I love you.\\
310 - Well, the basket doesn't
really count because I traveled.\\
311 - You could never travel...\\
312 - Because I love you.\\
313 - Eric, you're acting
like a huge dork.\\
314 - A huge dork who loves you. God!\\
315 - God! Stop it! Our...\\
316 - Look, the only reason I
said it is because I felt it\\
317 - and not just so
you'd say it back.\\
318 - And if I knew you were gonna
get in such a twist about it,\\
319 - I wouldn't have said it at all.\\
320 - I'm not in a twist.
It's just...\\
321 - "Cake." Okay, that
was pretty stupid. Yes!\\
322 - Thank you.\\
323 - So, I mean, why'd you say it?\\
324 - I don't know. I just...\\
325 - Now...\\
326 - Once it is out there,\\
327 - if we broke up, I mean...\\
328 - You know, what would I
tell myself, then?\\
329 - I guess you could tell
yourself you still have cake.\\
330 - We both know how much
it means to you.\\
331 - That's nice.
There's a sweet girl.\\
332 - Okay, look, I have an idea.\\
333 - Why don't we just pretend
it never happened?\\
334 - I like that.
Now.\\
335 - Okay.\\
336 - Never happened.
Okay.\\
337 - Okay.\\
338 - And you did travel, so my ball.\\
339 - Yes!\\
340 - Hi, you two.\\
341 - Thought you might wanna know.\\
342 - Midge and I worked things out.\\
343 - Well, that's just great, Bob.\\
344 - Yeah. We're separating.\\
345 - You can't stay with us.\\
346 - No. I'll be
staying at home.\\
347 - We're gonna live together.\\
348 - We're just gonna
see other people.\\
349 - Okay, Bob, I want you
to think about this.\\
350 - You're living in the same house,\\
351 - but you're dating other people.\\
352 - I'm not saying for sure
there'll be problems,\\
353 - but I want you
to think about it.\\
354 - Think hard, Bob.\\
355 - I think it's gonna be sexy.\\
356 - Oh, Hyde.\\
357 - What a fabulous look for you.\\
358 - Seriously. You look like
Marlon Brando or something.\\
359 - Oh, my God.\\
360 - Hyde, when did you get so hot?\\
361 - What?\\
362 - I've always been hot.
Jacket just brings it out.\\
363 - No.\\
364 - No! Give it to me!
Give me back my jacket!\\
365 - What are you doing?\\
366 - Get off me, you load!\\
367 - So, they're really
gonna separate?\\
368 - Yeah, but they're still
gonna live together.\\
369 - Oh. Wow.\\
370 - Are... Are you okay?\\
371 - Yeah, but, I mean, that's just like
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.\\
372 - I mean, how's that
supposed to work?\\
373 - Well, I imagine it'll be like\\
374 - when Gilligan and
the Skipper had a fight,\\
375 - and they drew a chalk line down the
center of their hut. That worked out great.\\
376 - Yeah. That solved all
their problems. Yeah.\\
377 - I love you.\\
378 - I love you, too.\\
379 - All right, then.\\
380 - You going to clean the bathtub?\\
381 - Yes, I am.\\
382 - No. It's just
too horrible.\\
383 - I can't let you do that, Kitty.\\
384 - Thank you, honey.\\
385 - You're welcome, Kitty.\\
386 - Eric, got a little job for you!
\subsection {Episode 08: Sleepover}
1 - You know, Donna,\\
2 - I'm not surprised
you're in my bed.\\
3 - I knew you couldn't
resist me any longer.\\
4 - No, I couldn't.\\
5 - I want you.\\
6 - I need you.\\
7 - Well, I never turn down
a woman in need.\\
8 - You know, being here,
in your bed,\\
9 - on your...
Spider-Man sheets,\\
10 - makes me feel so ready,\\
11 - so willing.\\
12 - Then call me Able.\\
13 - Wait, wait.\\
14 - A little mood music.\\
15 - I like dreamin'\\
16 - 'Cause dreamin'
can make you mine\\
17 - I like dreamin'\\
18 - Dreamin'\\
19 - Damn.\\
20 - What's wrong?\\
21 - Ah!\\
22 - I mean...\\
23 - Hey, baby.\\
24 - Hangin' out\\
25 - Down the street\\
26 - The same old thing\\
27 - We did last week\\
28 - Not a thing to do\\
29 - But talk to you\\
30 - We're all all right\\
31 - We're all all right\\
32 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
33 - I can't believe
you're in my bed.\\
34 - I can't believe you
came through my window.\\
35 - I know. Well, I was just sitting
at home thinking about you,\\
36 - and I thought,\\
37 - why don't I crawl up the side
of his house and say hello.\\
38 - So... Hello.\\
39 - Hello.\\
40 - Did anyone see you?\\
41 - Uh, just Hyde.\\
42 - Excuse me.\\
43 - I heard a noise downstairs,
and it scared me.\\
44 - Man, you're ruining
what could be\\
45 - the most important
night of my life here.\\
46 - Well, duh.\\
47 - This is so...\\
48 - I can't believe this.\\
49 - You've never been
in my bed before.\\
50 - I know.\\
51 - I'm in your bed.\\
52 - You're in my bed.\\
53 - You're in my bed.\\
54 - You're in my bed.\\
55 - Okay, um, because
the bed squeaks.\\
56 - Because the walls are thin.\\
57 - Because Red has
the ears of a wolf.\\
58 - Reasons my parents
might hear us if we do it.\\
59 - Right! Okay.\\
60 - Okay. Uh, "Gee, Mom,
it was hot,\\
61 - "so we took off our clothes...\\
62 - "And then we got cold,\\
63 - "so we got under the covers,\\
64 - "and things just started
bouncing around."\\
65 - Things I might say if
my folks catch us doing it.\\
66 - Yes! Okay. Um, uh,\\
67 - Fonda, Ford, the eighth...\\
68 - Famous Henrys.\\
69 - Yes! Okay, uh...\\
70 - Because there's
a girl in your bed.\\
71 - Because there's
a girl in your bed.\\
72 - Because there's a girl
in your bed, damn it!\\
73 - Reasons to go for it!\\
74 - Yes!\\
75 - So, I, uh...\\
76 - So she's gonna be
out the whole week?\\
77 - Well, you don't drink
and go ice fishing.\\
78 - That is just common sense.\\
79 - No, no, no.
It's fine.\\
80 - I'll be happy
to pick up her shifts.\\
81 - Okay. Uh-huh. Bye.\\
82 - Oh, jeez, Kitty, you work
so hard as it is.\\
83 - I don't want you working
double shifts.\\
84 - Well, Red, we need the money.\\
85 - It's not every week\\
86 - that Charlene's gonna get
septicemia from a rusty hook.\\
87 - We have gotta take
advantage of that.\\
88 - Well, I don't like it.\\
89 - Oh, you know...\\
90 - If I'm gonna be working nights,\\
91 - I'd better put some meals
together for you and the boys.\\
92 - Oh, come on, Kitty.\\
93 - I'm not helpless.\\
94 - I think I can get
these guys some dinner.\\
95 - Okay. Yeah. Um...\\
96 - I'm sure you'll be great.\\
97 - Fire extinguisher's
in the garage.\\
98 - So money's a little tight, huh?\\
99 - No, no, Steven.\\
100 - Everything's fine.
We're great.\\
101 - Good morning.\\
102 - And I am not just saying that.\\
103 - Listen, your mother's
working double shifts,\\
104 - so I'll be cooking.\\
105 - You know the fire extinguisher's
in the garage, right?\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - I know.\\
108 - I'm gonna have cereal.\\
109 - Oh, you'll be having
a lot of cereal.\\
110 - So, where's Donna, man?\\
111 - Donna?\\
112 - Donna? Oh,\\
113 - you mean that girl who
spent last night in my bed?\\
114 - Yeah. Yeah,
that's the one.\\
115 - She went home this morning.\\
116 - So?\\
117 - Heh? Heh?\\
118 - So?\\
119 - So let's just say she went
home a very happy woman.\\
120 - All right, man,
you finally did it.\\
121 - Yeah.\\
122 - You know, "it"\\
123 - can mean a lot of things.\\
124 - No. "It" means one thing,\\
125 - and you either did it
or you didn't.\\
126 - Okay, then we didn't,\\
127 - but we did plenty of good stuff.\\
128 - New stuff.\\
129 - Plenty of good, new stuff.\\
130 - God, man, you're bumming me out.\\
131 - Couldn't you have
at least just lied to me?\\
132 - Uh, okay. We did it.\\
133 - Liar.\\
134 - So, do you like photos, man?\\
135 - Yeah, man. Sure.\\
136 - Okay. You got the job, man.\\
137 - Just like that?\\
138 - You don't have to
interview anybody else?\\
139 - Nobody else showed up, man.\\
140 - So, what do I do here, anyway?\\
141 - Well, I don't expect a lot, man.\\
142 - Pretty much, if the hut
doesn't burn down,\\
143 - it's been a good day.\\
144 - And even if it burnt down,
man, it's cool,\\
145 - 'cause I got three or four
more of these\\
146 - little huts somewhere.\\
147 - Hey, listen, if you see
one of these huts,\\
148 - would you give me a call, man?\\
149 - Or even better,
I could take a picture.\\
150 - Whoa.\\
151 - A picture of a photo hut.\\
152 - Hey, that'd be like art
or something, huh?\\
153 - Hey, listen, man,\\
154 - I hope you don't mind
if I pay you in cash.\\
155 - I don't like Big Brother\\
156 - getting into my business,
you dig?\\
157 - Man, keeping the
government out of it,\\
158 - I'm so with you.\\
159 - No. My big brother, man.\\
160 - He's always hitting me up
for money.\\
161 - Oh. 'Cause you're
the responsible one?\\
162 - Yeah. It's my curse, man.\\
163 - Hey, listen...\\
164 - I gotta go, uh...\\
165 - Do a thing at, uh...
A place.\\
166 - Yeah, man.
I hear that.\\
167 - So you want me
to lock up when I'm done?\\
168 - Lock up.\\
169 - Wow. That's a great
idea, man.\\
170 - Hey, you're one of those
idea men, aren't you, man?\\
171 - Yeah. Maybe someday you'll
be working for me, huh?\\
172 - Really?\\
173 - Aw, that'd be cool, man.\\
174 - Hey, but can I have
Saturday night off?\\
175 - Cool.\\
176 - So, you know what?\\
177 - What?\\
178 - Oh, I can't tell you.\\
179 - Oh, my God. Now you
have to tell me.\\
180 - Even if it's not about me,
I want to hear it.\\
181 - I was really bad last night.\\
182 - Did you shoplift?
I knew it.\\
183 - No.\\
184 - I slept with Eric last night.\\
185 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\\
186 - Was it great?\\
187 - Yeah. I was asleep.\\
188 - - Ew!
- No.\\
189 - No, Jackie, we were both asleep.\\
190 - So nothing happened?\\
191 - Well, you know,
some things happened.\\
192 - But we mostly slept.\\
193 - You mean you were in his bed\\
194 - and he didn't whine and beg
for, like, two hours\\
195 - until you're so sick
of hearing his stupid voice\\
196 - that you just gave in
so he would shut up?\\
197 - No.\\
198 - I love him.\\
199 - He just, like,
held me all night.\\
200 - Oh, my God!
That's so sweet.\\
201 - Michael's just after me
all the time.\\
202 - I mean, I understand 'cause
I'm sexy and all, but still.\\
203 - Like, okay, he always, says,\\
204 - "Why cuddle when
we can do it?"\\
205 - Well, was he always like that?\\
206 - No. No, I guess things kind
of changed after we did it.\\
207 - But in a good way.\\
208 - I love it when Eric holds me.\\
209 - Yeah. I love it when
Michael buys me stuff.\\
210 - Well, guys, I'm a little
ashamed to admit this,\\
211 - but I got a job.\\
212 - Yeah. I'm thinking
about getting a job\\
213 - at a chip factory.\\
214 - I gotta know how they do this.\\
215 - Yeah. Red won't
let me get a job.\\
216 - He says if I don't study hard
and get into college,\\
217 - once I turn 18,
he's gonna kill me.\\
218 - I think he's serious, man.\\
219 - Hyde, did you ever stop to think\\
220 - how you working would make me\\
221 - go to the mall alone today?\\
222 - You didn't think, did you?\\
223 - No. Sorry.\\
224 - Hey, guys, check this out, man.\\
225 - Forman had Donna
in his bed last night,\\
226 - and he didn't even do it.\\
227 - What's up?\\
228 - You're a bonehead, man.\\
229 - I'm not a bonehead.\\
230 - We did other stuff,
and we cuddled.\\
231 - It was great.\\
232 - Sometimes when I'm alone,
I just love to cuddle.\\
233 - Forman, look, she climbed up
the trellis of your house,\\
234 - through your window,\\
235 - to get into bed with you
and cuddle?\\
236 - Sorry, man. I never read
that letter in Penthouse.\\
237 - Those stories are
true, you know.\\
238 - Why would you just
cuddle with her\\
239 - when you could do it?\\
240 - I mean,\\
241 - Forman, doing it is "it."\\
242 - That's why they call it "it".\\
243 - "It!"\\
244 - Guys, it was just one night.\\
245 - There are gonna be
lots of other nights.\\
246 - Eric, opportunity does not knock\\
247 - and then ring the doorbell
and then knock again,\\
248 - and then leave a note that
says, "Sorry I missed you".\\
249 - And then call you
on the phone...\\
250 - Yeah, yeah.
We get it, Fez.\\
251 - I mean, we get it.\\
252 - What my foreign friend here
is trying to say, Forman,\\
253 - is that you blew it, man.\\
254 - And you blew it, man.\\
255 - I'm losing my patience
with you, man.\\
256 - You gotta get with her.\\
257 - There's nothing more beautiful\\
258 - than when two people fit
together perfectly like...\\
259 - Well, like
two of these potato...\\
260 - How do they do this?\\
261 - Hey.\\
262 - Yeah.\\
263 - You wanna eat this?\\
264 - No.\\
265 - Well, it's in there if
you change your mind.\\
266 - I loved being here with you
the other night.\\
267 - Great. 'Cause I love
that you came over.\\
268 - It didn't, like, bother you\\
269 - that I was sleeping with you
in your little single bed?\\
270 - No, it bothered me,\\
271 - but in a really good way.\\
272 - Good.\\
273 - Good. Um, so...\\
274 - You wanna come over tonight?\\
275 - Yeah, cool.
I'd love to.\\
276 - Great.\\
277 - 'Cause I'm, like,
wide open here.\\
278 - Cool. So
I'll see you tonight?\\
279 - Okay.\\
280 - Jeez. You didn't eat
that fish, did you?\\
281 - 'Cause I was just kidding.\\
282 - No.\\
283 - All right, then.\\
284 - Stop acting weird.\\
285 - Hello, Mr. Forman.\\
286 - How are you doing today?\\
287 - Damn!\\
288 - That pot's no good.\\
289 - That pot would not
have boiled over\\
290 - had you put some
salad oil in the water.\\
291 - So you know how to boil water.\\
292 - Don't you have someplace
you need to be?\\
293 - Not really. If I go
home too early,\\
294 - my host parents
make me read Scripture.\\
295 - Well, why don't you, uh...\\
296 - - Go sit
in the basement?
- All right.\\
297 - Well, what do you know?\\
298 - Haji had it right.\\
299 - Hey, man.\\
300 - So this is where you work, huh?\\
301 - Yeah, that's what they say.\\
302 - Hey, won't you get in
trouble if the boss shows up?\\
303 - Oh, no.
Is the boss here?\\
304 - Hey, wait.
I'm the boss.\\
305 - You know, maybe
third time's the charm.\\
306 - Maybe this time it'll be
really, really super.\\
307 - Ta-da!\\
308 - Oh, my gosh, Red.\\
309 - Fried chicken
and mashed potatoes.\\
310 - Coleslaw.\\
311 - Oh, and a little
half an ear of corn.\\
312 - Oh. I forgot
the biscuits.\\
313 - Nice, huh?\\
314 - Oh, it's really nice!\\
315 - Where'd you hide
the bucket, Red?\\
316 - Here.\\
317 - Have a Wet-Nap.\\
318 - All right.
The Colonel.\\
319 - Oh, um, there you go.\\
320 - Well, now what is this?\\
321 - Look, I got a job, all right?\\
322 - And I don't wanna hear
anything about "We're fine."\\
323 - Because I know
money's tight around here\\
324 - and you won't let Forman work,\\
325 - so just take the money
and drop it.\\
326 - Oh, he's a keeper.\\
327 - I'm gonna take that money\\
328 - and open him a savings account.\\
329 - Well, that's nice, Red.\\
330 - Or blow it all on booze.\\
331 - I still haven't made up my mind.\\
332 - Ah, it's my good friend Eric.\\
333 - So, what will it be?\\
334 - Gilligan's Island?\\
335 - Pinball? Stratego?\\
336 - You decide.\\
337 - Well, actually, Fez,\\
338 - Donna's coming over tonight,\\
339 - so I'm just here to get
my Barry White album.\\
340 - Otherwise, I would just love...\\
341 - Blah, blah, blah.
Just go.\\
342 - Oh, baby. I am
ready for love.\\
343 - Why...\\
344 - Hello. I've been
expecting you.\\
345 - Yawn. So, okay.
You ready for bed?\\
346 - Sure. Okay.\\
347 - What, no Spider-Man sheets?\\
348 - Well, I just use those
on wash day.\\
349 - Eric.\\
350 - Can we, like, slow down
for a second?\\
351 - Sure.\\
352 - Well...\\
353 - Remember the other night,\\
354 - when we just, like,
cuddled all night?\\
355 - I really liked that.\\
356 - Right. Yeah.\\
357 - But I was thinking,\\
358 - why cuddle when we could do it?\\
359 - Okay. You've been talking\\
360 - to those idiots
in the basement again.\\
361 - No.\\
362 - Yes.\\
363 - Look, Eric, I know
it's a long drive,\\
364 - and... And we're
gonna get there.\\
365 - We're gonna get there.\\
366 - But, I don't know,\\
367 - I wanna see some
trees along the way.\\
368 - Okay.\\
369 - But I'll be driving?\\
370 - You'll be driving, yes.\\
371 - You swear to God?\\
372 - I do.
I swear to God.\\
373 - - Okay.
- Okay, good.\\
374 - Because I do love you.\\
375 - But I'm not gonna
take my pants off.\\
376 - - Okay.
- Okay.\\
377 - Would you be more comfortable
if I put mine back on?\\
378 - Mmm, might sleep better.\\
379 - Will do.\\
380 - Hey, what are you doin', man?\\
381 - You turn that thing off
and get ready for work!\\
382 - I'm not working today, man.\\
383 - I got an earache.\\
384 - Earache, my eye! How'd
you like a buttache?\\
385 - Now get your little fanny
perpendicular and open the hut!\\
386 - You got it?\\
387 - What a hard-ass, man.
\subsection {Episode 09: Eric Gets Suspended}
1 - Hey, check it out. I got
an "F" on my report card.\\
2 - An "F"?
What'd you fail?\\
3 - English.\\
4 - Isn't that what we speak?\\
5 - Hey, I got a "B" in Spanish.\\
6 - When did I start taking Spanish?\\
7 - Whoa.\\
8 - Donna, that's a cigarette.\\
9 - Even worse, it's a menthol.\\
10 - You're gonna get
suspended, little lady.\\
11 - When did you start smoking?\\
12 - What? You just
saw me light it.\\
13 - That's ha, ha, ha.
Come on, Donna.\\
14 - You know smoking causes cancer.\\
15 - I know, but it
makes me look cool,\\
16 - so it's an even trade.\\
17 - Hold this?\\
18 - Oh, jeez, Forman,
hold it like a man, would ya?\\
19 - Shut up!\\
20 - Wow, Donna, first
you fail English,\\
21 - now you're smoking?\\
22 - Can I ask you what,\\
23 - what are you doing?\\
24 - Smoking.
Failing.\\
25 - Hey, Forman.\\
26 - Smoking on school property?\\
27 - No, that's not his. That's mine.\\
28 - No, it's, uh...\\
29 - It's mine.\\
30 - Yeah.\\
31 - Mmm.\\
32 - Menthol.\\
33 - Eric, quit it.\\
34 - Yeah, ok.
Let's go, Forman.\\
35 - Dios mio.\\
36 - No es bueno.\\
37 - Hangin' out\\
38 - Down the street\\
39 - The same old thing\\
40 - We did last week\\
41 - Not a thing to do\\
42 - But talk to you\\
43 - We're all all right\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
46 - Eric Forman's first suspension.\\
47 - I'm so proud.\\
48 - No way. Back up.
Why'd he get suspended?\\
49 - Because he's stupid.\\
50 - They can do that?\\
51 - No.\\
52 - He told them it was his
cigarette, and that's stupid.\\
53 - Please, Donna, stop.\\
54 - Don't fall all over
yourself thanking me.\\
55 - I didn't need your help.\\
56 - Yeah, Forman.\\
57 - I think she wants
to get in trouble.\\
58 - It's Donna's
little cry for help.\\
59 - Help me! Help me!\\
60 - We hear you, Donna,\\
61 - and we love you.\\
62 - Get bent.
You guys are jerks.\\
63 - Wait. Why am I a jerk?\\
64 - I don't even know
what's going on.\\
65 - This is great.\\
66 - Why'd I even
take the fall? I mean,\\
67 - Donna doesn't care.\\
68 - And, you know,
Red's gonna kill me.\\
69 - Relax, Forman, he's not gonna...\\
70 - Oh, wait. Did you
say kill you?\\
71 - Yeah, you're right.\\
72 - Hyde, this isn't funny.
On Red's list of screw-ups,\\
73 - getting suspended from
school is right up there with\\
74 - backing over my mom.\\
75 - Hey, man. Having a
chick is about sacrifice.\\
76 - Like Jackie. She wants
to decorate my van\\
77 - with some of her
girly stuff, right?\\
78 - So I tell her she can
have one stuffed animal.\\
79 - In the glove box.\\
80 - See? Sacrifice.\\
81 - Kelso, remember how you used to\\
82 - - put your whole fist
in your mouth?
- Yeah.\\
83 - Do it now.\\
84 - Damn, why is everybody
so crabby today?\\
85 - What's in the suitcase?\\
86 - Stuffed animals
for the van, remember?\\
87 - Look, Michael, I know
we agreed on just one,\\
88 - but then I got to thinking,\\
89 - and well, I want them all.\\
90 - - But...
- But what Michael?\\
91 - But...\\
92 - Okay.\\
93 - Oh, ease up on her, Kelso.\\
94 - You know, sacrifice is hard.\\
95 - So, my host parents\\
96 - set me up on a blind date,\\
97 - and she has a friend
for you, Hyde.\\
98 - Finally.
Somebody to love.\\
99 - And it gets better.\\
100 - They're not even blind.\\
101 - Get it? Blind.\\
102 - Screw you.
That's funny.\\
103 - Oh, hi, honey.\\
104 - Your mom and I are
going out tonight.\\
105 - It's happy hour at Swingles.\\
106 - What's Swingles?\\
107 - It's a singles' bar.\\
108 - No, it's a swingers' bar.\\
109 - Yeah, it's both.\\
110 - And you're neither.\\
111 - Don't get involved, Donna.
This is grown-up stuff.\\
112 - Well, before you go,
there's my report card.\\
113 - An "F"?\\
114 - Donna, we're very disappointed,\\
115 - and we're gonna have
a long talk about this.\\
116 - Yes, we are.\\
117 - Right after happy hour.\\
118 - Provided we don't meet anyone.\\
119 - All right.\\
120 - I've learned my lesson,
and I'll be sure to try harder.\\
121 - There's our girl.\\
122 - Ooh, wish us luck.\\
123 - Welcome home, smoker.\\
124 - Oh, no.\\
125 - The school just called.\\
126 - You're lucky I answered
the phone and not Dad.\\
127 - You didn't tell?\\
128 - Eric, of course I didn't tell.\\
129 - Well...\\
130 - If it isn't
Mr. Smoker.\\
131 - Oh, wait. Yes, I did.\\
132 - I'm nervous.\\
133 - Don't be nervous.
You'll get sweaty.\\
134 - Oh, no.
Too late.\\
135 - I can't help it. This is my
first official American date.\\
136 - That's why I'm here, Fez.\\
137 - To help you out, man.\\
138 - Unless they're uggos,
and then I'm gone.\\
139 - There they are,\\
140 - and they're not even uggos.\\
141 - No, they're hot.\\
142 - And the blonde's blonde and hot.\\
143 - Yes, and since I set
us up on this date,\\
144 - she's mine, right?\\
145 - Well, I can see why
you'd think that,\\
146 - but actually, since I
came along to help you out,\\
147 - American custom dictates\\
148 - that I get the blonde.\\
149 - Once again, the local
custom bones the foreign guy.\\
150 - America, man.\\
151 - Love it or leave it.\\
152 - This, this is
Chamomile the camel.\\
153 - He can sit in the backseat,\\
154 - but llama Cass here,\\
155 - she has to sit up
in the front with us.\\
156 - Well, Jackie, uh, it's just...\\
157 - I thought all you wanted
was to put in one little animal.\\
158 - Well, I know,
Michael, but this way\\
159 - there'll be even more
things to remind you of me.\\
160 - Don't you like
thinking about me?\\
161 - No, of course I do.\\
162 - Uh, the thing is...\\
163 - How can I say this without
hurting your feelings?\\
164 - Oh. Okay.\\
165 - I don't want your stupid
things in my cool van.\\
166 - - Oh!
- What?\\
167 - No! I didn't say
you were stupid.\\
168 - Just everything you like!\\
169 - Congratulations, Eric.
You got suspended.\\
170 - Are you getting dumber?\\
171 - Gee, I don't think so.\\
172 - Look, Dad, I don't smoke.\\
173 - Daddy, if Eric's a smoker,\\
174 - and he lies about smoking,\\
175 - doesn't that make
him a smoking liar?\\
176 - Okay, you know what?
That's enough.\\
177 - Eric, have some
more pot roast. Here.\\
178 - Here's some mashed potatoes,\\
179 - and here's a photo
of a cancerous lung.\\
180 - Whoa!\\
181 - Mom, gross!\\
182 - Look, I don't smoke!\\
183 - Okay, well, either way,\\
184 - that is what's gonna happen to
your lungs if you keep on smoking.\\
185 - Well, the way he's
screwing up his life,\\
186 - death will be a sweet release.\\
187 - So I got that
to look forward to.\\
188 - You got suspended, pal.\\
189 - How do you think your college
interviews are gonna go?\\
190 - Well, looks like
we have a model student here.\\
191 - Excellent grades,\\
192 - secretary-treasurer
of the AV Club.\\
193 - Uh-oh, what's this?\\
194 - You were suspended?\\
195 - Yes, sir, for smoking.\\
196 - Well, we can't have a
loser like you at our school.\\
197 - I'm sorry to say, you're not
Princeton material, dumb-ass.\\
198 - Oh, if only\\
199 - I'd listened\\
200 - to my mother.\\
201 - Sorry.\\
202 - What a lesson I have learned.\\
203 - - Can I go?
- Sure.\\
204 - Right after you smoke this
entire pack of cigarettes.\\
205 - Yay, Daddy!\\
206 - Ooh, tear off the filters.\\
207 - Dad, you can't be serious.\\
208 - Have I ever not been serious?\\
209 - Dad, I'm telling you the truth.\\
210 - Okay, you have to
take my word for it.\\
211 - I don't smoke.\\
212 - Your word, huh?\\
213 - It's all a man has.\\
214 - Well, now that's nice.\\
215 - What a load
of crap. Light up!\\
216 - Hey.\\
217 - I heard Eric got suspended.\\
218 - Yeah, and we're all real proud.\\
219 - I'll tell you what, Red.\\
220 - I think Donna's
been having trouble\\
221 - because Eric's a bad influence.\\
222 - Could be.\\
223 - But did you ever think the way
you and Midge act like idiots,\\
224 - that might be screwing her up?\\
225 - Nope. I'm pretty
sure it's Eric.\\
226 - Well, that's
kind of stupid, Bob.\\
227 - Well, I guess the truth hurts.\\
228 - So does a swift kick in the ass.\\
229 - All right. I'm going.\\
230 - But a swift kick in the ass\\
231 - is not the solution
to everything, Forman.\\
232 - I gotta disagree, Bob.\\
233 - - Gee, Dad. Thanks.
- Keep sweeping, smoker.\\
234 - Will do.\\
235 - Jackie, get in the van!\\
236 - No!\\
237 - - Jackie, get in the van!
- No!\\
238 - - Get in the van.
- No!\\
239 - - Jackie...
- No!\\
240 - Jackie, get in the van!\\
241 - - Hey.
- Hi.\\
242 - So,\\
243 - what you wanna do?
You wanna watch some TV,\\
244 - eat some ice cream or,\\
245 - I don't know, apologize to me?\\
246 - - I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.\\
247 - Okay. I'm sorry. I was
expecting more of a fight.\\
248 - Did you get in a lot of
trouble for the cigarette?\\
249 - Uh, surprisingly, yes.\\
250 - Turns out,
Red has a temper, so...\\
251 - - Really?
- Yeah.\\
252 - And, uh,\\
253 - your dad doesn't
like me anymore.\\
254 - That's okay,\\
255 - 'cause I do.\\
256 - What's he doing here?\\
257 - Who?\\
258 - Maybe you should get off me\\
259 - so I could, like,\\
260 - run away.\\
261 - You better get out of here.\\
262 - Okay, fine. I'll
get out of here.\\
263 - Actually, I think
he was talking to me.\\
264 - Come on.\\
265 - Okay. Uh, boy,
this is awkward\\
266 - with Donna
and the yelling and the...\\
267 - So then my pastor said\\
268 - it's okay to get a "B"
every once in a while.\\
269 - Nobody's perfect,\\
270 - except...\\
271 - You know who.\\
272 - You know, it's
just so refreshing\\
273 - to meet someone whose beliefs\\
274 - are the complete
opposite of mine.\\
275 - I know. Well,
I'm Episcopalian,\\
276 - and my best friend's
Presbyterian, but,\\
277 - we're still best friends.\\
278 - It's hard work,
but it's worth it.\\
279 - I bet you make
really good punch, huh?\\
280 - Oh, my gosh.\\
281 - The best.\\
282 - Yeah, I mean, these teachers\\
283 - think they deserve our
respect, but they don't.\\
284 - I mean, who are they to teach
us about history and math?\\
285 - I, too, am filled with
rebellious sexual tension.\\
286 - Yeah.\\
287 - I mean, it's like
Malcolm X said,\\
288 - "By any means necessary," right?\\
289 - You like Malcolm X?\\
290 - Hey, who doesn't
like Malcolm X, huh?\\
291 - You've heard of
Malcolm X in Panama?\\
292 - Oh, no. I'm not
from Panama. I'm from...\\
293 - Hey, Fez, come here.\\
294 - American custom be damned.\\
295 - I want you to have the blonde.\\
296 - Oh, my God.\\
297 - Blondes are notorious whores.\\
298 - Thank you, Hyde.\\
299 - Not a problem.\\
300 - Hi.\\
301 - Bye.\\
302 - Come on, Jackie.
Just get in the van.\\
303 - No.\\
304 - - Jackie,
just get in the van.
- No.\\
305 - - Jackie.
- No.\\
306 - - Get in the...
- No.\\
307 - - Jackie.
- No!\\
308 - Jackie, get in the van!\\
309 - No.\\
310 - All right.\\
311 - I'm just gonna leave now.\\
312 - Bye.\\
313 - Aw, damn it,
Jackie, get in the van!\\
314 - Nope.\\
315 - I heard G-11.\\
316 - So, naturally I
yelled out "Bingo!"\\
317 - Boy, was the pastor
cheesed at me.\\
318 - Great story.\\
319 - So you are a blonde?\\
320 - Yeah. Natural.\\
321 - I can't believe you like all
the same bands that I like.\\
322 - Yeah. I just like music\\
323 - that's passionate and rebellious\\
324 - and really pisses off my dad.\\
325 - Oh, Patty, don't say piss.\\
326 - Oh!\\
327 - Hey, you know what'd
really piss off your dad?\\
328 - You and me grab a 12-pack\\
329 - and stay out all night.\\
330 - Oh, I can't. I have
a big test tomorrow.\\
331 - That's funny.\\
332 - Let's go.\\
333 - No, really.
I've gotta go study.\\
334 - Study?\\
335 - You don't study.
You've got a tattoo.\\
336 - Look, Hyde, rebellion
is cool and all,\\
337 - but I want to get
into a good college\\
338 - so I can fight the
system from the inside.\\
339 - It was nice meeting
you, though. Mary?\\
340 - Oh, no. Go ahead without me.\\
341 - So, Fez, um,\\
342 - my parents aren't home.\\
343 - Wanna come back to my
house? I have a hot tub.\\
344 - That would be super.\\
345 - Donna, is it me, or...\\
346 - Does your dad hating me
make me even more sexy?\\
347 - Sure.\\
348 - Yeah,\\
349 - I think he senses
my bad-boyness.\\
350 - Yeah, Eric, you're a
parent's worst nightmare.\\
351 - Yes.\\
352 - Yes, I am.\\
353 - Mom, what are you doing?\\
354 - Nothing.\\
355 - And you, you just...\\
356 - You do as I say, not as I do.\\
357 - Oh, hey, Mom, cool.\\
358 - Give me a drag.\\
359 - Okay, see? Now Laurie
is doing as I do.\\
360 - That is wrong.\\
361 - What's
going on out here?\\
362 - Eric, are you smoking again?\\
363 - I think he is, Daddy.\\
364 - No, he is not.\\
365 - I don't smoke!\\
366 - I think this might be my fault.\\
367 - I think he is,
he's just imitating me\\
368 - so he can look cool.\\
369 - Mr. and Mrs. Forman,\\
370 - Eric got caught holding
my cigarette at school.\\
371 - I'm the one who was smoking.\\
372 - Oh?\\
373 - Well, Donna, thank
you for your honesty.\\
374 - What?\\
375 - You... How come
you believe her?\\
376 - I told you I don't smoke.\\
377 - Okay. I'm gonna
go home now,\\
378 - so, uh, good night.\\
379 - Eric's not in trouble now?\\
380 - Fine!\\
381 - Well, now.\\
382 - I think you have
something to say to Eric.\\
383 - Oh, yeah, uh...\\
384 - Nice job on the driveway.\\
385 - Red.\\
386 - Okay. Just...\\
387 - Okay. I'm gonna
say I'm sorry,\\
388 - but, you know, you do lie a lot.\\
389 - What have I lied about?\\
390 - You've lied about the beer keg,\\
391 - the dent in the Vista Cruiser.\\
392 - You lied when you said\\
393 - you weren't taking
the car out of town.\\
394 - Wait.
You knew about that?\\
395 - - I do now.
- Oh!\\
396 - Ha!\\
397 - We're even.\\
398 - Oh, Dad, you've
gotta be kidding me.\\
399 - Okay.\\
400 - I'm sorry I made you
smoke all those cigarettes.\\
401 - Okay.\\
402 - Yeah.\\
403 - That's okay.\\
404 - Actually, I kind of liked 'em.\\
405 - Watch it.\\
406 - No, no. I bet they'd
go great with beer.\\
407 - So does a swift kick in the ass.\\
408 - Jackie, get in the van!\\
409 - No.\\
410 - All right, fine. I give up!\\
411 - I give up!\\
412 - You can keep your
stuffed animals in the van.\\
413 - Do you really mean it?\\
414 - Yeah.\\
415 - But just one.\\
416 - - Five.
- Two.\\
417 - - Four.
- Three.\\
418 - Deal.\\
419 - Oh!\\
420 - Five.\\
421 - All right, five.\\
422 - - Six.
- Fine!\\
423 - So, you have me in your tub.\\
424 - If you are trying to
send a sexy message,\\
425 - then message received.\\
426 - Well, Fez...\\
427 - I know we made out
in my parents' bedroom,\\
428 - and I know we frenched
in the pool house,\\
429 - and I know that may seem
romantic to some people...\\
430 - Tell me something I don't know.\\
431 - I have a boyfriend.\\
432 - See? That I did not know.\\
433 - Fez, I really like you, but\\
434 - he's in college,\\
435 - and we're still faithful.\\
436 - I see.\\
437 - You know,\\
438 - there are many ways
to remain faithful\\
439 - yet still have fun.\\
440 - Really?\\
441 - Oh, yes.\\
442 - Ah...\\
443 - That's much better.\\
444 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
445 - So...\\
446 - I told Bob and Midge
that it was my cigarette.\\
447 - And how'd that go?\\
448 - Really good.
They grounded me.\\
449 - Cool. Ha, ha.\\
450 - So what are you doing over here?\\
451 - Snuck out.\\
452 - Being grounded makes
it so much naughtier.\\
453 - You know, Donna,\\
454 - I'm not gonna
tell you what to do,\\
455 - but\\
456 - failing classes
is not the only way\\
457 - to get attention
from your parents.\\
458 - I mean,\\
459 - for instance, a lot of girls,\\
460 - when they're having
a bad time at home, just\\
461 - go slutty.\\
462 - You know what, Eric?\\
463 - You're right.\\
464 - Let's have sex right now.\\
465 - - Really?
- No.\\
466 - Stop doing that!\\
467 - - Michael,
get in the van.
- No!\\
468 - - Michael,
get in the van.
- No!\\
469 - - Get in the van!
- No.\\
470 - - Michael!
- No.\\
471 - - Get in the van.
- No!\\
472 - Fine.\\
473 - Hey!\\
474 - No, wait! Jackie!\\
475 - Jackie, it's my van!\\
476 - Jackie!

2 - Who's the birthday boy?\\
3 - The, um, good-looking
guy to your left?\\
4 - That's right.\\
5 - Happy, happy, happy,
happy birthday, Red\\
6 - Would the special birthday boy\\
7 - like a special birthday present?\\
8 - Oh... It's already
unwrapped.\\
9 - And, uh, just my size, too.\\
10 - Oh, my.\\
11 - Well...\\
12 - Happy birthday to me.\\
13 - Hangin' out\\
14 - Down the street\\
15 - The same old thing\\
16 - We did last week\\
17 - Not a thing to do\\
18 - But talk to you\\
19 - We're all all right\\
20 - We're all all right\\
21 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
22 - Yeah?\\
23 - - Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?\\
24 - Well, it's Red's birthday\\
25 - and I gotta get him
a present, so...\\
26 - Where do your parents
keep their booze?\\
27 - Pretty much everywhere.\\
28 - Cool.\\
29 - Okay.\\
30 - Red Forman, you
know him, you love him.\\
31 - What do you think, blueberry
brandy or peach schnapps?\\
32 - Hmm...\\
33 - Definitely the schnapps.\\
34 - My thoughts exactly.\\
35 - This one's for me.\\
36 - Oh, I see your father
left me another message.\\
37 - God, he's an ass.\\
38 - Hello, Mom?
I have company.\\
39 - Oh, I didn't see
you there, Steven.\\
40 - Isn't Bob an ass?\\
41 - Okay, um, my parents are freaks\\
42 - and I'm sorry
you had to see that.\\
43 - Oh, yeah?\\
44 - Donna, I don't want
you reading this.\\
45 - Dad, Hyde's here.\\
46 - Well, you can read it
'cause you'll appreciate it.\\
47 - But not you.\\
48 - This sucks.\\
49 - Well, you wanna talk about it?\\
50 - No.\\
51 - You know, they want
to date other people.\\
52 - - Your mom's dating?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
53 - So where am I?
Do I have a shot?\\
54 - Oh, could you
please date my mom?\\
55 - That would make my life
so much better, Hyde.\\
56 - Hey, call me Dad.\\
57 - Yeah, but you know
what the worst part is?\\
58 - Watching your parents
split up and knowing\\
59 - there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.\\
60 - Exactly.\\
61 - And you know what else?\\
62 - My mom moved out
of their bedroom,\\
63 - into the guest room.\\
64 - Yeah, it sucked
when my dad split.\\
65 - But I can honestly say\\
66 - that my parents' divorce\\
67 - made me the man I am today.\\
68 - Oh, man, am I going to go crazy\\
69 - and think the government's
out to get me, too?\\
70 - The government is
out to get you.\\
71 - Okay, now I want your
father to enjoy this birthday,\\
72 - so we're all going to try
our best to make it good.\\
73 - Except for Laurie,
who's going to stumble in\\
74 - smelling like
cigarettes and beer.\\
75 - Hey, at least I'm here.\\
76 - Well, you better be
here with a present.\\
77 - I gave you $20 yesterday.\\
78 - God, relax.\\
79 - Oh, you can it, Laurie.\\
80 - - Yeah, can it, Laurie.
- Can it, Eric.\\
81 - Yeah, can it, Eric.\\
82 - - I thought I told
you to can it.
- Can it.\\
83 - Why don't you both can it?\\
84 - Can it!\\
85 - Oh, look, it's the birthday boy.\\
86 - Daddy!\\
87 - Come on in, birthday boy.\\
88 - Open your presents.\\
89 - I wonder what's in the big one?\\
90 - Is it a Corvette?\\
91 - No, it's, uh, 2x4s.\\
92 - For the roof.\\
93 - Oh, yeah.\\
94 - Thanks for reminding me.\\
95 - Here you go, Red.
This will help you forget.\\
96 - Happy birthday, man.\\
97 - Daddy!\\
98 - This is for you.\\
99 - Well.
Let's see here.\\
100 - Well! $7.\\
101 - Isn't that something?\\
102 - Thanks, sweetie.\\
103 - If I don't have $13 on
my dresser by tonight,\\
104 - then so help me God...\\
105 - The card cost 50 cents.\\
106 - Fine, $12.50
and I want a receipt.\\
107 - Whatever.\\
108 - Okay, boys, thank you
for the wood...\\
109 - And the booze.\\
110 - Okay, now... Now,\\
111 - one more present.\\
112 - Ooh.\\
113 - Underwear!\\
114 - Oh, damn it.\\
115 - Well, happy birthday.\\
116 - So, is the happy
birthday fun over yet?\\
117 - No.\\
118 - Bob and Midge want to
take us out to dinner tonight.\\
119 - Bob and Midge!\\
120 - Kitty, it's my birthday.\\
121 - I know, but they like you,\\
122 - and they want you to
have fun on your birthday,\\
123 - like I do.\\
124 - If they really liked me,
they'd leave me alone.\\
125 - Man, last night we could
hear the Pinciottis fighting\\
126 - all the way across the driveway.\\
127 - It was horrible.\\
128 - It was all,\\
129 - "You're the devil, Midge!"\\
130 - "Oh, Bob, shut up."\\
131 - "Oh, Bob, shut up!"\\
132 - That's classic.\\
133 - Man, if you get any dumber\\
134 - you're gonna need a helmet.\\
135 - What a bummer for Donna, huh?\\
136 - I can't believe they're
sleeping in separate bedrooms.\\
137 - Yeah, I know.\\
138 - Wait, I don't know.\\
139 - What are you talking about?\\
140 - Well, Hyde knows
something about Donna\\
141 - that Eric does not know.\\
142 - This is an interesting
development.\\
143 - Let's watch.\\
144 - Midge is sleeping in
the guest bedroom, man.\\
145 - How did you know that?\\
146 - Did Donna tell you that?\\
147 - Look, Forman,
it's not a big deal.\\
148 - I guess she's just
telling me stuff\\
149 - that she's not telling you.\\
150 - See, this is why
communication is so important.\\
151 - Now, Michael and I...\\
152 - Uh, excuse me, we were talking
about Donna and me and how...\\
153 - Oh, hush.
No one cares.\\
154 - Now, Michael never
keeps secrets from me.\\
155 - Do you, sweetie?\\
156 - Huh?\\
157 - Oh, no, no.
Never.\\
158 - Michael, you hesitated.\\
159 - Why did you hesitate?\\
160 - No, I didn't hesitate.\\
161 - Did I, Hyde?\\
162 - Yep.\\
163 - Fez?\\
164 - Oh, yes. If you
really loved her,\\
165 - you would not have hesitated.\\
166 - Ah!\\
167 - Conversation, Michael.\\
168 - - The van, now.
- No!\\
169 - No, I didn't hesitate!\\
170 - You guys are dead!\\
171 - Well, so what do you
think, birthday boy?\\
172 - 'Cause I think
it's gonna be fun.\\
173 - Well, you know,
good food, old friends.\\
174 - This might not be
too bad, Kitty.\\
175 - Hey, hey,
the gang's all here!\\
176 - This is my date Carol.\\
177 - And this is my date Ted.\\
178 - You brought dates?\\
179 - We sure did.\\
180 - Happy birthday!\\
181 - Yeah, Carol here
is just terrific.\\
182 - She loves horses.\\
183 - I love horses!\\
184 - And Ted's a marriage counselor.\\
185 - Well, you have just done
a lovely job with these two.\\
186 - Hey, thanks.
Hoo-hah.\\
187 - Right.\\
188 - So you two are going
to save your marriage\\
189 - by dating strangers.\\
190 - Great.\\
191 - When you say it like that, Red,\\
192 - it sounds stupid.\\
193 - Okay, Midge.\\
194 - Say it so it doesn't
sound stupid.\\
195 - Okay, here.\\
196 - Now maybe this cheese toast\\
197 - will make your birthday happy.\\
198 - No, Kitty, I think
I've lost my appetite.\\
199 - God, that is
a great-lookin' T-bone.\\
200 - Is there butter on this?\\
201 - Hoo-hah.\\
202 - Right.\\
203 - Now, I'm gonna eat this steak,\\
204 - but first I'm gonna
make a birthday wish.\\
205 - Here it is.\\
206 - I wish...\\
207 - Everyone would shut up.\\
208 - Something wrong?\\
209 - No.\\
210 - So, is there anything
on your mind?\\
211 - Something you might
want to, you know,\\
212 - - talk to your...
- No.\\
213 - Don't take no
for an answer.\\
214 - She talked to Hyde,\\
215 - get her to talk to you.\\
216 - Get her...
On, my God,\\
217 - that can't be
her tongue, can it?\\
218 - How is she doing that?\\
219 - So soft, so...\\
220 - Wait! Focus! Talk!\\
221 - So, uh, nothing on your mind?\\
222 - Nothing...\\
223 - That's a pretty little shirt.\\
224 - Holy God, she's sucking
my tongue.\\
225 - She is sucking my tongue.\\
226 - Oh, my God,
even her spit is sweet.\\
227 - It's like liquid Jolly Rancher.\\
228 - There's something wrong with me.\\
229 - No, there's not, I'm 17.\\
230 - Wait!\\
231 - So, nothing...\\
232 - Uh, to confide in me?\\
233 - Eric.
Your boyfriend.\\
234 - Well, okay, here's something.\\
235 - I love making out with you.\\
236 - There. So we talked.\\
237 - Yeah, that was nice.\\
238 - Horses are beautiful.\\
239 - And they're very smart.\\
240 - They can count, you know.\\
241 - Oh, honey, honey,\\
242 - you... You just...
You just gotta shut up.\\
243 - Speaking of,
has anyone read Equus?\\
244 - I gave a copy to Midge,\\
245 - but, no offense, sweetie...\\
246 - It may be a little
too deep for her.\\
247 - Wait a minute.\\
248 - What do you mean,
"No offense?"\\
249 - Well, I mean, don't be offended.\\
250 - Oh.\\
251 - Listen, you insult
my wife one more time,\\
252 - you're gonna be wearing
your steak as a hat.\\
253 - Hey, I...
I'm sorry.\\
254 - Oh, Bob, that was so sweet.\\
255 - Like in high school, when
you used to hit people\\
256 - just for looking at me.\\
257 - - Remember?
- Of course
I remember.\\
258 - I still have the scar\\
259 - from Joe Abbruzzi's
dental plate.\\
260 - You big bear.\\
261 - I, uh, left my wallet
in the car, Midge.\\
262 - I left my... Sex
with Bob in the car.\\
263 - Bye!\\
264 - Check, please!\\
265 - Ah.\\
266 - There you go, that's for you.\\
267 - Come on, Kitty.\\
268 - Donna wouldn't even talk to me.\\
269 - She just kept sticking
her tongue down my throat.\\
270 - Oh, boo-hoo, Forman.\\
271 - You get to fool around
with a totally hot chick\\
272 - and you never have to
talk about her feelings?\\
273 - You poor, French-kissing
bastard.\\
274 - Yeah, Hyde's right.\\
275 - One time I asked
Jackie what was wrong,\\
276 - and she didn't shut up
for, like, three straight days.\\
277 - You know, Kelso,\\
278 - sometimes you do
not know what you have\\
279 - until it is gone.\\
280 - And then someone else has it\\
281 - and it is not you.\\
282 - And then that someone
else is really happy.\\
283 - What are you talking about?\\
284 - You don't know what
he's talking about?\\
285 - That's it.
Get the helmet.\\
286 - Kelso, put this on.\\
287 - Shut up. I'm not
putting the helmet on.\\
288 - Now what are you talking about?\\
289 - I'll tell you what
I am talking about\\
290 - if you put the helmet on.\\
291 - Fine.\\
292 - If you don't
take care of Jackie,\\
293 - you are going to lose her.\\
294 - That's just stupid.\\
295 - Look, Hyde, all I know\\
296 - is that you're talking
to my girlfriend,\\
297 - and I don't like it.\\
298 - Hey, man, I was
friends with Donna\\
299 - before you ever became
her little boyfriend.\\
300 - Hyde, you're pissing me off.\\
301 - Why don't you think, Forman?\\
302 - You get to make out\\
303 - with one of the hottest
chicks in Wisconsin,\\
304 - while I'm being all sympathetic\\
305 - and relating my
crappy life to her,\\
306 - and I'm pissing you off?\\
307 - You're supposed to be the friend\\
308 - and I'm supposed to
be the make-out guy.\\
309 - Now that I think about it,\\
310 - you're pissing me off!\\
311 - What the hell kind of a
world are we living in?\\
312 - "Hey, let's date
other people!"\\
313 - "Hey, let's date other people\\
314 - "but ditch 'em
and do it in a car!"\\
315 - That's enlightened?\\
316 - In my day, we called
them degenerates,\\
317 - and we stoned them.\\
318 - With big rocks.\\
319 - Oh, you did not.\\
320 - Well, we should have.\\
321 - Well, you know...\\
322 - Your birthday's not over
for another two hours.\\
323 - Oh, Kitty.\\
324 - We have no ceiling
on our bedroom.\\
325 - What if a plane flew over?\\
326 - Okay.\\
327 - Well, the kids are out.\\
328 - There's a big comfy couch
in the living room.\\
329 - You know what I love about you?\\
330 - What?\\
331 - Lots of stuff.\\
332 - Come on.\\
333 - I'll race you.\\
334 - Hey, Red,
Mrs. Forman.\\
335 - How was your night?\\
336 - What the hell are you
doing in my living room?\\
337 - Watching Star Trek.\\
338 - In color.\\
339 - See, that guy? He's one
side black and one side white.\\
340 - And the other guy is one
side white and one side black.\\
341 - In color!\\
342 - This house is always
littered with kids.\\
343 - It's like we're Mormons.\\
344 - Okay, come on.
Follow me, sailor.\\
345 - Red needs to control his anger.\\
346 - I heard that!\\
347 - Oh, I know!\\
348 - Let's go to the basement.\\
349 - Oh, Kitty.\\
350 - I just want this day to be over.\\
351 - No.\\
352 - This day is not over.\\
353 - I wanted you to have
a nice birthday.\\
354 - You know, sometimes
birthdays are not just about you.\\
355 - They are about
the people around you\\
356 - who want you to have
a nice birthday.\\
357 - So, it's about me.\\
358 - Now get downstairs\\
359 - and get those pants off, mister!\\
360 - Okay, move it!\\
361 - Donna.\\
362 - I'm glad you're here.\\
363 - I... I've been thinking
about this a lot,\\
364 - and, uh...\\
365 - I'm not mad anymore.\\
366 - Okay.\\
367 - Mad about what?\\
368 - Oh. Well, uh...\\
369 - Hyde told me that you two talked\\
370 - about your home situation...\\
371 - You guys talked about me?\\
372 - Yeah...\\
373 - Well, see, but Kelso
was wearing a helmet,\\
374 - so he only heard,
like, half of it.\\
375 - And I'm not really sure
about Fez's grasp of English.\\
376 - I mean, he nods a lot, but...\\
377 - I can't believe you
guys talked about me.\\
378 - Well, to be honest,\\
379 - it was a lot of Hyde
with the, uh,\\
380 - "Donna and the parents
and the separate bedrooms..."\\
381 - And I'm all like, whoa,
hold up there, Hyde.\\
382 - I don't think she'd like
you talking about her.\\
383 - God!\\
384 - No, I...
Just hear me out.\\
385 - I don't know why
you talked to Hyde,\\
386 - but\\
387 - I forgive you.\\
388 - You forgive me?\\
389 - No, what I'm saying...\\
390 - You don't have
to do that anymore.\\
391 - Because I'm here for you.\\
392 - Okay, thanks loads, Eric,\\
393 - but you can't help me with this.\\
394 - Your family is...
A family.\\
395 - Donna, to be fair, you
didn't even give me a chance.\\
396 - You never came to me with this.\\
397 - All right, fine.
You know what?\\
398 - You want to be part
of this whole thing?\\
399 - You do? Fine.\\
400 - My parents, they're on
a freakin' date right now.\\
401 - Well, you know, that's nice.\\
402 - With other people.\\
403 - You know, the more the merrier.\\
404 - It takes some
of the pressure off.\\
405 - They're each dating
the other people.\\
406 - But they're married.\\
407 - Oh, God!\\
408 - - See?
- I mean...\\
409 - I don't know.\\
410 - Hey, Donna, Eric,
glad you're here.\\
411 - Great news.\\
412 - Your father and I had sex.\\
413 - Oh, my God.\\
414 - In the car.\\
415 - Oh, my God!\\
416 - Well, that's... Super!\\
417 - Hey, isn't that...
Is that super, Donna?\\
418 - So, are you guys, like,
back together?\\
419 - Oh, no.\\
420 - Yeah, why ruin a good thing?\\
421 - Okay, so...\\
422 - What's your take on that?\\
423 - I got nothing.\\
424 - What am I gonna do?\\
425 - I don't know.\\
426 - So, hey, who's your
stupid boyfriend?\\
427 - Uh, you are.\\
428 - Hey, at least I'm trying
to get smarter, right?\\
429 - Thank you.\\
430 - Say it.\\
431 - I do not keep secrets from you.\\
432 - Again.\\
433 - I do not keep secrets from you.\\
434 - Again.\\
435 - I do not keep...\\
436 - Aiiyy!
Shut up!\\
437 - I am going insane.\\
438 - Kelso, if you want
to possess a woman,\\
439 - this is what you need to do.\\
440 - I, as a mortal, am not
worthy of your love.\\
441 - You are a goddess
and I worship you.\\
442 - And I dedicate every
moment of my waking life\\
443 - to your joy.\\
444 - Okay, what he said.\\
445 - Oh, Michael.\\
446 - I don't know any
Mormons that do that.\\
447 - Not without a permit, anyway.\\
448 - You know, Kitty,\\
449 - this ended up being a
pretty good birthday after all.\\
450 - Oh, yay!\\
451 - - Happy birthday.
- Thanks.\\
452 - What is this?\\
453 - Ah, corn chips.\\
454 - Birthday boy.\\
455 - Something's not right here, man.\\
456 - I'm getting a really weird vibe,\\
457 - like before a tornado.\\
458 - Or Dracula.\\
459 - Something bad has happened here.\\
460 - Something horrible.\\
461 - Michael... Michael,
I'm frightened.\\
462 - Well, whatever it was\\
463 - made the couch nice and warm.\\
464 - Someone's been eating my chips.
\subsection {Episode 11: Laurie Moves Out}
1 - So, um, Laurie's
almost all packed.\\
2 - I can't believe
my little girl is movin' out.\\
3 - Which reminds me,\\
4 - when are you leaving?\\
5 - Never,\\
6 - 'cause I love it here.\\
7 - Right.\\
8 - Kitty, do you really think
this is a good idea?\\
9 - I mean, it might be a little
soon for her to be on her own.\\
10 - Red, she is gonna be fine.\\
11 - She's gonna split rent
with a girlfriend.\\
12 - She doesn't even have a job.\\
13 - Well, she is gonna get a job.\\
14 - Oh, that reminds me.
Can I have her room?\\
15 - No. I already
gave it to Steven.\\
16 - But I'm your son...\\
17 - Daddy.\\
18 - Oh, man, would you
look at this place.\\
19 - It's kind of girlie.\\
20 - It's a girl's room, Hyde.\\
21 - Oh, so all those guys, they
were just passin' through?\\
22 - Well, that's over.\\
23 - Welcome to Hydeville, baby.\\
24 - You know, if I cared
about this dump at all,\\
25 - that would totally creep me out.\\
26 - Come on, Laurie,
you're gonna miss your room.\\
27 - It's not like
you have no feelings\\
28 - ever\\
29 - about anything.\\
30 - Yes!\\
31 - I'm so psyched!\\
32 - Aw.\\
33 - Did you finally figure out
how a Thermos works?\\
34 - No, I'm psyched about
your new place, you know.\\
35 - 'Cause whenever
we fool around here,\\
36 - I'm always afraid that
Jackie's gonna catch us.\\
37 - You know, I don't want to
hurt her 'cause I love her.\\
38 - You know, so this is great.
It solves everything.\\
39 - Kelso, you are not allowed
anywhere near my new place. Ever.\\
40 - Laurie...\\
41 - You know what? You freaks,
you got about two minutes\\
42 - to deal with this little
drama here,\\
43 - then get the hell
out of my room.\\
44 - Whoa.\\
45 - I see what's goin' on here.
You're breakin' up with me.\\
46 - No.\\
47 - For me to break up with you,\\
48 - there would have to be
something between us to break.\\
49 - Oh!\\
50 - I cannot believe that
you are being such a...\\
51 - Bitch?\\
52 - Duh.\\
53 - Look, Kelso...\\
54 - It was fun and sweaty and all,\\
55 - but you're just the
guy I fooled around with\\
56 - when there was
nothing good on TV.\\
57 - Sorry.\\
58 - Well, maybe there won't be anything
good on TV at your new place!\\
59 - Oh, damn! There's always
somethin' good on TV.\\
60 - Hangin' out\\
61 - Down the street\\
62 - The same old thing\\
63 - We did last week\\
64 - Not a thing to do\\
65 - But talk to you\\
66 - We're all all right\\
67 - We're all all right\\
68 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
69 - Hey, Kelso, look who's here.
It's Jackie.\\
70 - Hi, Jackie.\\
71 - God, Laurie, I can't
believe you're moving.\\
72 - I know we didn't
spend much time together,\\
73 - but I think some of my good
taste was rubbing off on you.\\
74 - And I'm so happy for that.\\
75 - Thanks, Jackie.
I'm gonna miss you, too.\\
76 - Oh, hey, Kelso, I almost forgot.\\
77 - I found a T-shirt of yours when
I was cleaning out my room.\\
78 - Say, how'd that get there?\\
79 - That's funny.\\
80 - No, this isn't even mine.\\
81 - Yeah, no, this must be
Eric's shirt.\\
82 - Your mom sewed your name
in it, Michael.\\
83 - Man, Eric's
gonna be pissed, huh?\\
84 - Yeah, 'cause I... See,
I borrowed Eric's shirt\\
85 - 'cause mine wasn't
working right...\\
86 - And, uh, then my mom must
have sewn my name in it.\\
87 - Mmm, I don't know, Michael.\\
88 - What, do you think I'm lying?\\
89 - Jackie, if I were lying, I'd come
up with a lot better lie than that.\\
90 - Yeah, you'd think so.\\
91 - So, Laurie's
definitely moving out?\\
92 - And it's definitely over
with her and Kelso?\\
93 - Well, she is moving
all the way across town.\\
94 - I mean, she is slutty, but...\\
95 - I mean, she hates
to commute, so...\\
96 - Good.\\
97 - Good, because Kelso's
a rat bastard,\\
98 - and I'm not covering for him.\\
99 - Donna,\\
100 - relax. It's over.\\
101 - So now you can get back
to pleasing your man.\\
102 - Eric, please leave. I have
to talk to Donna alone.\\
103 - Well, okay, 'cause, I mean,
it's not like this is my home or...\\
104 - Eric!\\
105 - Jackie, you have something
you want to ask me?\\
106 - See, I'm kind of worried
about Michael and Laurie.\\
107 - I mean, she found
his T-shirt in her room,\\
108 - and he said it wasn't his, even
though it had his name in it.\\
109 - And at that time,
I believed him,\\
110 - but now I can't remember why.\\
111 - But if there is
something going on,\\
112 - I think I want to know...\\
113 - But I don't want to know.\\
114 - God, I don't even know if
I want to know, you know?\\
115 - I'm supposed to say...\\
116 - Donna, you're supposed to say
that there's nothing going on,\\
117 - that Michael loves me,
and we're together,\\
118 - and that's all that matters.\\
119 - That sounds good.\\
120 - God, you're so naive!\\
121 - Isn't there, like, someone
else you can talk to about this?\\
122 - Yeah, well, I used to have
this pen pal in Nicaragua,\\
123 - but she just stopped writing
after this hurricane thingy.\\
124 - Your new room is very pretty.\\
125 - Like a flower or a girl.\\
126 - You know, people might see this
room and think you are the gay.\\
127 - I don't think so, Fez.\\
128 - Oh, Hyde, you would be surprised\\
129 - how easily people
can make that mistake.\\
130 - Hey, Hyde, thanks for
your help with Jackie, man.\\
131 - Sure thing, man.\\
132 - Okay, Hyde, do you know
what sarcasm is?\\
133 - No.\\
134 - Hyde, man, you almost
got me caught.\\
135 - I almost got you caught?\\
136 - "My mom sewed my name
in Eric's shirt"?\\
137 - You are so lame, man.\\
138 - Well, you know,
half the time you act\\
139 - like you want me to get caught.\\
140 - Kelso, you're my friend.\\
141 - I don't want you to get caught.\\
142 - 'Cause if you get caught,
then my fun is over.\\
143 - Right?\\
144 - So I'm just trying
to prolong your suffering.\\
145 - Well, okay, that's
a little better.\\
146 - All right.\\
147 - - Friends for life, baby.
- Yeah.\\
148 - Well, Steven's
getting all settled in.\\
149 - He'd better not change anything.\\
150 - I don't want him messing
with my little girl's room.\\
151 - I mean, you know how he is.\\
152 - Messy, dirty, foul.\\
153 - What if she has to
move back home?\\
154 - Oh, Red, she is gonna be fine.\\
155 - Oh, I know, Kitty, you
think that she is all grown up,\\
156 - but there's still a lot
that she doesn't know.\\
157 - I mean, what if her place
doesn't have a deadbolt?\\
158 - Or a smoke detector?\\
159 - Red, you don't have
to baby her. She's 20.\\
160 - You're never too old
to burn to death in a fire.\\
161 - Well, would you look at this.\\
162 - She even found a place
in a nice neighborhood.\\
163 - Ain't she somethin'.\\
164 - Well, I hope she hasn't
had breakfast yet...\\
165 - Or a fire.\\
166 - Can I help you?\\
167 - Uh... No, got the wrong
apartment, I guess.\\
168 - Sorry.\\
169 - Not a problem.\\
170 - Uh, wait, is Laurie there?\\
171 - Oh, yeah.\\
172 - Uh, hold on
a second. Honey.\\
173 - Oh, hi, Daddy.\\
174 - Damn it all to hell!\\
175 - Honey, what's wrong?\\
176 - What's wrong?
Everything is wrong.\\
177 - Damn kids today, they
wouldn't know responsibility\\
178 - if it walked up
and bit 'em in the ass.\\
179 - Get a job?\\
180 - Ha!\\
181 - It's just party all night,\\
182 - dance all day,\\
183 - and sex everywhere in between!\\
184 - Sickening!\\
185 - Laurie's living with a boy.\\
186 - Yes.\\
187 - Just...\\
188 - Just one boy, right?\\
189 - Yeah, I think so.\\
190 - Well, now, see?
It could have been worse.\\
191 - Laurie's busted.\\
192 - This is, and I don't think
I'm exaggerating here,\\
193 - the greatest day
in the history of time.\\
194 - Except maybe the day
cheese was invented.\\
195 - I love the cheese.\\
196 - Wow, man,\\
197 - she's gone one day,\\
198 - and she's already got a new guy.\\
199 - Kelso, you heartbreaker, you.\\
200 - Yeah, I'm havin' a horrible day.\\
201 - Laurie's gone and Jackie's
all suspicious of me.\\
202 - And I'm gettin'
no lovin'. None.\\
203 - I can't be me without lovin'.\\
204 - Kelso...\\
205 - If you want
to keep Jackie, man,\\
206 - and trust me, you don't,\\
207 - you gotta act innocent, okay?\\
208 - Let's practice.\\
209 - So, did you
fool around with Laurie?\\
210 - You know I did!\\
211 - Dumb-ass, no, man!
Complete denial.\\
212 - Watergate. Learn.\\
213 - So, did you
fool around with Laurie?\\
214 - Yeah.\\
215 - Wait, no.
I mean, no!\\
216 - Wait, I mean, yeah.\\
217 - No, see, this isn't gonna work.\\
218 - It was just so perfect.\\
219 - If I could go back in time,\\
220 - I'd just relive that moment
over and over again.\\
221 - "Hi, Daddy."\\
222 - "Hi, Daddy."\\
223 - "Hi, Daddy."\\
224 - Just tell Jackie the truth.\\
225 - Then, if she leaves you
for another man,\\
226 - whoever he might be,\\
227 - no hard feelings.\\
228 - You do not need Jackie.\\
229 - Sweet, luscious Jackie.\\
230 - You are an evil
little foreign man.\\
231 - Don't ever change.\\
232 - Look, Kelso, all right,\\
233 - I'll help you out
with Jackie, man.\\
234 - I'll talk you through the
whole thing step by step.\\
235 - Thanks, man.\\
236 - You know, I guess it was wrong,\\
237 - what I did with Laurie.\\
238 - But I was just amusing
myself, you know?\\
239 - And that's the key
to life, right?\\
240 - Never stop amusing yourself.\\
241 - Unless it starts to chafe.\\
242 - Then you should take a week off.\\
243 - It's almost Tuesday, right?\\
244 - Eric,\\
245 - I'm asking you,\\
246 - have I been a bad father?\\
247 - Maybe I've been too hard on her.\\
248 - I mean,
for God's sake,\\
249 - I think I'm a fair man.\\
250 - Right?\\
251 - Eric, I'm talkin' to you.\\
252 - Does this need more mayonnaise?\\
253 - Get out of here!\\
254 - Thank you.\\
255 - Boy, Kitty,\\
256 - we got a pair to beat a
full house, that's for sure.\\
257 - Well, Red, relax.
You're overreacting.\\
258 - I'm overreacting?\\
259 - Well, I'll tell you what, Kitty,\\
260 - people are gonna talk.\\
261 - Her livin' with that guy.\\
262 - Red, it doesn't matter
if people talk.\\
263 - Laurie is still
a part of this family,\\
264 - which is why I invited
her to dinner tonight.\\
265 - Oh, no, no, no, Kitty.
I'm not ready for that.\\
266 - Oh, that's sweet,\\
267 - the way you say that
like you have a choice.\\
268 - Look, Kitty...\\
269 - She's coming.\\
270 - Well, I'm glad we're all eating
dinner together as a family.\\
271 - Yeah, it's nice,\\
272 - especially since Laurie could
make it from all the way across town,\\
273 - where she lives\\
274 - with some guy\\
275 - in sin.\\
276 - Are you ever gonna hit puberty?\\
277 - Oh.\\
278 - Ow. But you know\\
279 - what's really sad is that you
got no respect for yourself\\
280 - or this family.\\
281 - Daddy.\\
282 - Well, he's not wrong.\\
283 - But... But, Daddy...\\
284 - Red.\\
285 - Well, Kitty,\\
286 - who's gonna buy the cow\\
287 - when they get the milk for free?\\
288 - You know,\\
289 - Dad, it's not like
she's hooking...\\
290 - Or some other less bad example.\\
291 - I mean, she's just
livin' with a guy,\\
292 - and it is the '70s now, right?\\
293 - What are you babbling about?\\
294 - Well, maybe...\\
295 - Maybe I just think you're
being a little hard on her.\\
296 - Well, that's nice, Eric,\\
297 - but right now I am too angry\\
298 - to pretend to give a crap
about what you think!\\
299 - These are great
potatoes, Mrs. Forman.\\
300 - Thanks, Eric.\\
301 - Yeah, sure.\\
302 - Okay, why don't you boys
take your plates in\\
303 - and watch some McMillan & Wife.\\
304 - You know, just once today
I'd like to finish a meal\\
305 - without getting chased
out of the room.\\
306 - Well, Laurie, you better stop
your lying and face up to this one.\\
307 - Just look at what you're
doing to your father.\\
308 - - Mom, I'm an adult, okay?
- No, no.\\
309 - No, an adult would have
told the truth\\
310 - and not lied about moving
in with a girlfriend,\\
311 - which I knew wasn't true.\\
312 - Well, Mom,
if you already knew,\\
313 - then why didn't you tell Dad?\\
314 - Then we wouldn't
be in this mess!\\
315 - Oh, good God,\\
316 - Rosemary had
a better baby than me.\\
317 - Okay, you've been
acting kind of weird\\
318 - ever since Laurie gave you
that T-shirt, Michael.\\
319 - First off, act innocent.\\
320 - I don't know what you're
talking about, Jackie.\\
321 - Of course, she'll
explain herself.\\
322 - It's like you're
hiding something.\\
323 - But you just stick
to your original story.\\
324 - I'm sticking
to my original story!\\
325 - Now, she'll be skeptical...\\
326 - Uh-huh...\\
327 - So go on the offensive.\\
328 - You know, Jackie, you're
just being paranoid...\\
329 - And that hurts.\\
330 - Because you don't trust me,\\
331 - and other stuff.\\
332 - And then, she'll be
so embarrassed,\\
333 - she'll cave
and apologize to you.\\
334 - Fine.\\
335 - I believe you, Michael.\\
336 - But know this.\\
337 - If you're not telling
the truth, I will find out,\\
338 - 'cause I'm smart,
and you aren't.\\
339 - Then all you have to do
is forgive her.\\
340 - Okay, Jackie, I forgive you.\\
341 - Red, I think you're being
a little hard on Laurie.\\
342 - I don't care what anyone thinks.\\
343 - What she is doing is wrong.\\
344 - Now that I think back on it,\\
345 - I don't know
if I ever knew that girl.\\
346 - Livin' with a guy.\\
347 - Oh, is that a foreign car?
Aw, jeez.\\
348 - Red, you have gone
your whole life\\
349 - thinking she is
just a little girl,\\
350 - but she is an adult now,
and she is not a perfect one.\\
351 - Boy, is she not a perfect one.\\
352 - But you know what?\\
353 - You have to love your children,\\
354 - even when they do things
you don't like\\
355 - or, better yet, hate.\\
356 - You think you do a good job,\\
357 - you think that you teach your children
the difference between right and wrong,\\
358 - and this is what you get.
Well, the hell with it.\\
359 - Okay, I guess we don't
love her anymore.\\
360 - Let's take all pictures
of Laurie out of here\\
361 - and pretend she's not ours.\\
362 - And if we see her on
the street, let's ignore her.\\
363 - No, let's throw things at her.\\
364 - Well, now you're
just being stupid.\\
365 - And you're not being
a good father.\\
366 - Well...\\
367 - Okay.\\
368 - Maybe I have
been kind of a...\\
369 - A dumb-ass.\\
370 - I was gonna say unreasonable.\\
371 - Fine. Fine.\\
372 - You're an unreasonable dumb-ass.\\
373 - Are you done now?\\
374 - I think I am.\\
375 - The Bradys were
such a nice family.\\
376 - I bet Mr. Brady never
grew to hate Marcia.\\
377 - But then again,
Marcia wasn't so whory.\\
378 - No, she really wasn't.\\
379 - What? No. Come on.
This is our thing.\\
380 - You love this.\\
381 - I'm mean to you.
You're mean to me.\\
382 - So, come on, hit me.\\
383 - Sorry.\\
384 - I can't. Not today.\\
385 - Eric, you were just leaving.\\
386 - Dad, I think maybe you
should take it a little easy on...\\
387 - Eric.\\
388 - You're on your own.\\
389 - Laurie, I've been,
uh, thinking...\\
390 - About
the thing that happened\\
391 - at the place you live.\\
392 - And, uh, I want you to know
that I understand\\
393 - that you're not
my little girl anymore.\\
394 - But I like being
your little girl.\\
395 - But you're not.\\
396 - You're my daughter.\\
397 - And you're a grown-up\\
398 - who's going to do
awful and stupid things.\\
399 - But I'll still love you.\\
400 - I love you, too.\\
401 - And I'm sorry.\\
402 - So, Daddy, can I move back in?\\
403 - Oh, yeah.\\
404 - Okay, good!\\
405 - Yeah, great to have you back.\\
406 - So...\\
407 - Your man friend
kicked you out, didn't he?\\
408 - No!\\
409 - He moved back in with his wife.\\
410 - Well, I just... I...\\
411 - I need a little yellow pill.\\
412 - Hyde!\\
413 - Hyde!\\
414 - Come on, Hyde, get out!
It's my room!\\
415 - No! I'll never leave.
You're in the basement.\\
416 - I'm the favorite now.\\
417 - Hyde, I'm serious!\\
418 - No! I've barricaded
the door.\\
419 - You'll never get in!\\
420 - Well, jeez, tough break.
\subsection {Episode 12: Eric's Stash}
1 - Well, boys, there she is,\\
2 - our brand-new water heater.\\
3 - Ain't she a beauty?\\
4 - Yep. This is
the best water heater ever.\\
5 - God bless us every one.\\
6 - You know why Tiny
Tim walked with a crutch?\\
7 - 'Cause he had a smart mouth?\\
8 - That's right.\\
9 - So, guys,\\
10 - tomorrow is the anniversary\\
11 - of Donna's and my first kiss.\\
12 - And just for that, I'm gonna
give her something really special.\\
13 - You've been trying to
give her that for a year,\\
14 - and so far...\\
15 - Not that.\\
16 - Something nice.\\
17 - Forman, man, trust me, okay?\\
18 - Just pick her some flowers.\\
19 - The fact that you even remembered
will guarantee you some action.\\
20 - And who doesn't love
the action, huh?\\
21 - Check out this necklace.\\
22 - - Wow, man,
is that real gold?
- No.\\
23 - - Real diamonds?
- No.\\
24 - But it costs 60 bucks.\\
25 - - Nice!
- Nice!\\
26 - Yeah, thanks.\\
27 - So, if you'll all
please avert your eyes,\\
28 - I have to, uh, get my
secret stash of cash.\\
29 - What, you mean
your Candy Land stash?\\
30 - My Can...\\
31 - I don't keep my money in the...\\
32 - Candy Land box.\\
33 - You moved your money
from the Candy Land box?\\
34 - Oh, shut up and turn around!\\
35 - Oh, my God, you guys.\\
36 - Someone stole all my money.\\
37 - From Candy Land?\\
38 - How could such a sad thing
happen in such a happy place?\\
39 - Hangin' out\\
40 - Down the street\\
41 - The same old thing\\
42 - We did last week\\
43 - Not a thing to do\\
44 - But talk to you\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - We're all all right\\
47 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
48 - The winner, and
still champion, Muhammad Ali.\\
49 - All right, Fez, you lose.\\
50 - Give me five bucks.\\
51 - Hey.
What's goin' on?\\
52 - I just lost five bucks
on the Muhammad Ali fight.\\
53 - Fez, that's a rerun. That
fight happened a week ago.\\
54 - So what are you guys doing?\\
55 - We're playing Candy Land.\\
56 - And I'm stuck in the
Marshmallow Mountain again.\\
57 - Where's Eric?\\
58 - I don't know.
He's searching the house.\\
59 - He can't find his money stash.\\
60 - It's not in the Candy Land box?\\
61 - Oh, my God.
You guys.\\
62 - Guess who's gonna be in the
Miss Dairy Princess Pageant?\\
63 - Oh, I know.
A cow?\\
64 - No.\\
65 - Me!\\
66 - A beauty pageant?\\
67 - Yeah! I mean,
look, Donna,\\
68 - it's not enough that we know\\
69 - I'm prettier than everyone else.\\
70 - I want the world to know!\\
71 - And what better way to do it\\
72 - than go on stage and parade
around like a piece of meat?\\
73 - I know! I know!\\
74 - And get this,\\
75 - Michael is gonna be
my pageant boy!\\
76 - Pageant boy.\\
77 - Jackie, I am not a pageant boy.\\
78 - I'm a beauty coach.\\
79 - Yeah, that's
a lot better, Kelso.\\
80 - So, Donna, you want
to go see my gown?\\
81 - Let's go.\\
82 - Oh, I will help.\\
83 - I have a way with women's' hair.\\
84 - Let's go, girls.\\
85 - Man, a beauty coach?\\
86 - What's goin' on
with you?\\
87 - When Jackie wins this pageant,\\
88 - I am gonna be the guy with the
hottest chick of all of the hot chicks.\\
89 - Yeah, Kelso, that's genius.\\
90 - Yeah, just picture it.\\
91 - And this year's
Miss Dairy Princess is...\\
92 - Kelso's girlfriend!\\
93 - Yes!\\
94 - Oh, thank you!\\
95 - Thank you.\\
96 - Thank you, Bob Eubanks.\\
97 - Mr. Kelso, now that
you've been crowned,\\
98 - what's going to be your
first order of business?\\
99 - Well,
as Mr. Dairy Princess,\\
100 - I would like to give milk
products to all of those in need.\\
101 - And then someday,\\
102 - I would like to rule an entire
hot chick dairy kingdom!\\
103 - Settle down, girls. There's
plenty of me to go around here.\\
104 - Well...\\
105 - Okay, I gotta go win this thing.\\
106 - All right, where's my money?\\
107 - What money?\\
108 - The money you stole from my...\\
109 - Special place.\\
110 - You mean, the
pathetic bundle of ones\\
111 - you keep in your little
Candy Land game?\\
112 - So you admit
you knew where it was.\\
113 - Okay, Eric, first of all,
you were a mistake.\\
114 - Ask Mom and Dad.\\
115 - And second, if I did steal it,\\
116 - I'd tell you to your face
and then I'd steal it more.\\
117 - Yeah, that does sound like you.\\
118 - Damn!
Who took my money?\\
119 - Isn't it obvious who took it?\\
120 - I mean, think about it,\\
121 - no morals, lack of
character, bad reputation.\\
122 - So you did take it.\\
123 - No, you idiot.
Hyde.\\
124 - He's staying
down in the basement,\\
125 - he's poor, he steals stuff.\\
126 - No.\\
127 - No, Hyde wouldn't do that to me.\\
128 - I'm sure you're right, Eric.
He's a real good friend.\\
129 - So,\\
130 - Kelso tells me Hyde tried
to steal Donna last year.\\
131 - - Is that true?
- No.\\
132 - I mean...\\
133 - Well, he tried,
but he didn't succeed.\\
134 - Hmm, that's not much
better, is it, Eric?\\
135 - Was I really a mistake?\\
136 - They sued the condom company.\\
137 - So?\\
138 - So what do you think?\\
139 - Jackie, if you want to win,\\
140 - that dress has to be
a lot shorter.\\
141 - Give to Fez.\\
142 - Okay, Jackie, let's get to work.\\
143 - Well, Michael, we've
already done a lot.\\
144 - I mean, I decided on this dress,\\
145 - and Fez is gonna do my hair.\\
146 - All right. But I'm gonna
tell you something, Jackie.\\
147 - I've seen pictures of his
people and they aren't pretty.\\
148 - Bite me, pageant boy.\\
149 - Coach.\\
150 - All right, fine. I guess
we could use the help.\\
151 - Fez, you can handle
Jackie's body\\
152 - and I'll take care of her mind.\\
153 - So, Jackie, does the winner
get a scholarship or something?\\
154 - Who cares?
College is for ugly girls\\
155 - who can't get
modeling contracts.\\
156 - No, college is for women who don't
want to marry the first idiot they meet\\
157 - and squeeze out
his bastard moron children.\\
158 - Hey, Mom.\\
159 - When you were
cleaning up downstairs,\\
160 - you didn't happen to come
across 60 bucks, did you?\\
161 - Oh, Eric, did you lose
your Candy Land cash?\\
162 - Does everyone know
where I keep my money?\\
163 - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
It was a good hiding place.\\
164 - Oh! Maybe you put it
in Chutes and Ladders.\\
165 - No. I checked.\\
166 - I mean, I don't know
who could have taken it.\\
167 - At first I thought
it was Laurie, but...\\
168 - Oh, honey, no. Laurie
wouldn't steal from you.\\
169 - She steals from me.\\
170 - Right.\\
171 - So that only leaves one person.\\
172 - I mean...\\
173 - He does live in the basement.\\
174 - Oh, okay, now,\\
175 - if you are talking about
Steven, I'm gonna get mad.\\
176 - He is a good apple and he is
your friend and you can trust him.\\
177 - Can I? I mean...\\
178 - No, Mom, I hate thinking this.\\
179 - It's just...\\
180 - It all adds up. I mean,
if not Hyde, then who?\\
181 - Well, it could be...\\
182 - Okay, you know what? I do not
want to talk about this anymore.\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - Oh.\\
185 - Here comes a dumb question.\\
186 - Uh,\\
187 - I wasn't a mistake, was I?\\
188 - Oh, for...\\
189 - For...\\
190 - Okay! Who wants
some cocoa?\\
191 - Okay, Jackie, in
30 seconds or less,\\
192 - what do you hope to accomplish
as Miss Dairy Princess?\\
193 - Go!\\
194 - Um...\\
195 - Um...\\
196 - Um...\\
197 - You just lost, lady!\\
198 - Michael, I was thinking.\\
199 - Oh, really?\\
200 - Well, in 1974, Miss
Alabama started thinking.\\
201 - Do you know where she is now?\\
202 - Alabama.\\
203 - Ew!\\
204 - God, Michael, I don't want
to accomplish anything.\\
205 - I just want the title\\
206 - so I can lord it over people.\\
207 - That's all I want, too, Jackie.\\
208 - Okay, so the next
category's talent.\\
209 - I can sing.\\
210 - Oh, no, you can't.\\
211 - So...\\
212 - Boy, am I disappointed.\\
213 - I went to get my money,
but someone stole it.\\
214 - So forget the fake gold
necklace from Sears.\\
215 - Now I gotta get Donna
a crappy gift.\\
216 - Hey, what would you guys
rather see Jackie do,\\
217 - walk a tightrope
or ride a mechanical bull?\\
218 - Well, either way, she'll fall
on her ass, so I like 'em both.\\
219 - So, Eric,\\
220 - which rat bastard do you
think stole your money?\\
221 - Well, I mean,
it's anyone's guess.\\
222 - For all I know, I mean,\\
223 - it could be someone
in this very room.\\
224 - How exciting.\\
225 - A mystery.\\
226 - Is Fez a suspect?\\
227 - Yeah, probably not, Fez.\\
228 - Why not?
I can be evil.\\
229 - I hate you.\\
230 - See?\\
231 - Oh, Eric, I don't hate you.\\
232 - I love you.
I'm sorry.\\
233 - That's okay, Fez.\\
234 - And, uh, I'm also pretty
sure Kelso here didn't take it.\\
235 - Hey, how long do you guys
think Jackie could hold her breath?\\
236 - Gee, Inspector.\\
237 - So if it isn't Kelso\\
238 - and it isn't Fez,\\
239 - I wonder who you could suspect?\\
240 - Dillhole.\\
241 - Uh-oh.\\
242 - Hyde, I didn't say you took it.\\
243 - Hey, you guys know
what a funny word is?\\
244 - Pickle-weasel!\\
245 - Forman, then say
I didn't take it.\\
246 - You are both bringing me down.\\
247 - Hyde, why don't you just say
you didn't take it?\\
248 - I shouldn't have to say
I didn't.\\
249 - Look, just tell me you didn't\\
250 - and I'll totally trust you.\\
251 - You know what's a funny word?\\
252 - Pickle-weasel!\\
253 - How about I tell you this?\\
254 - Go to hell, Forman!\\
255 - Oh, my God! Jackie should
clog dance! We can't lose!\\
256 - Beauty pageant, here
we come!\\
257 - Aw, you ran out
of gas, you idiot.\\
258 - You forgot to get gas?\\
259 - God, Jackie, someone
had to hem your outfit\\
260 - for the clog dance.\\
261 - Michael, I told you,\\
262 - I'm not doing a clog dance!\\
263 - God, your stupid van
has ruined my life!\\
264 - Your life?\\
265 - What about my life?\\
266 - What about your life?\\
267 - Jackie, we are a team.\\
268 - And part of being a team\\
269 - is that you have to do
exactly what I tell you.\\
270 - You know, Jackie, there
is no "U" in "teamwork"!\\
271 - Oh, Jackie, you're upset.\\
272 - Come, sit on my lap.\\
273 - Ta-da!
Happy anniversary!\\
274 - Oh, my God.\\
275 - Wow, they're beautiful.\\
276 - I got you something, too.
Here, open it.\\
277 - Oh, my God.\\
278 - It's a watch.\\
279 - And it's all digital and stuff!\\
280 - Oh, gee, look at that.\\
281 - You had it engraved.\\
282 - What, you don't like it?\\
283 - No. No, I love it.
It's just...\\
284 - Man, you spent
a lot of money on this.\\
285 - Yeah, which means
you better start putting out.\\
286 - Okay, it's kind of hard
to be a tease\\
287 - if you're not playing along.\\
288 - Donna, I was going to get you
something really great, but...\\
289 - Yeah, I heard about the
crime spree in Candy Land.\\
290 - Yeah.\\
291 - Oh! You want
to see a picture\\
292 - - of what I was
going to get you?
- Sure.\\
293 - You were gonna get me that?\\
294 - Oh, my God, that's so pretty.\\
295 - What do you think, by Christmas
maybe, if you save your money?\\
296 - Donna.\\
297 - Well, Eric, after seeing this,\\
298 - I mean, I hate
these crappy flowers.\\
299 - I know. I didn't want to
give you crappy flowers.\\
300 - I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.\\
301 - I love the flowers.\\
302 - But, you know,\\
303 - maybe if I return that watch,\\
304 - I can get this for myself.\\
305 - - Give me the watch back!
- No way!\\
306 - - Give me it!
- Come and get it!\\
307 - I don't know, Fez,
maybe Michael was right.\\
308 - Maybe I don't have what it takes\\
309 - to win the pageant by myself.\\
310 - That is nonsense.\\
311 - You are pretty and nice
and talented and sweet,\\
312 - and everything good
in the whole world is you.\\
313 - I know, I know.\\
314 - That's what I told Michael.\\
315 - But then he said...\\
316 - Who cares what Michael said?\\
317 - He was using you for your beauty\\
318 - so he could become popular.\\
319 - He makes me sick.\\
320 - God.\\
321 - I never thought of it that way.\\
322 - Okay, Jackie.\\
323 - I've had some time to think,\\
324 - and, uh...\\
325 - I'm still disappointed in you.\\
326 - But I'm willing to talk about...\\
327 - Okay, stop.\\
328 - Michael, stop. I've
been talking to Fez,\\
329 - and I have only one
thing to say to you.\\
330 - I love you!\\
331 - What?\\
332 - See, Michael, you must
have really believed in me\\
333 - to think you could ride
my coattails to the top.\\
334 - Oh, baby.\\
335 - Come here.\\
336 - Mmm.\\
337 - Okay, get off me, both of you.\\
338 - You make me sick.\\
339 - Hey,
what are you doin', Red?\\
340 - Ah, I borrowed Eric's
Candy Land money\\
341 - to pay for the water heater.\\
342 - You, uh, you took Eric's money?\\
343 - Shh. He doesn't know
a thing about it.\\
344 - It's back now.
He'll be none the wiser.\\
345 - Hey, hey!
How ya doin'?\\
346 - Look, Hyde,\\
347 - I just got back from
hanging out with Donna\\
348 - and you know what?\\
349 - Hyde, I don't even care
what happened to my money.\\
350 - 'Cause money doesn't make
the world go around.\\
351 - You know what does?\\
352 - Screw you.
You called me a thief.\\
353 - It's love.
That's right.\\
354 - Love makes the world go around.\\
355 - Well, that's great.\\
356 - Because Red took your money.\\
357 - Right, Hyde. My
dad took it. Yeah.\\
358 - Why don't you ask him, Forman?\\
359 - Uh, Dad, Hyde said
you took my money?\\
360 - Oh, yeah. I was a little
short on the water heater.\\
361 - Thanks for helping out.\\
362 - Good news, buddy.
You're cleared.\\
363 - Why don't you get bent, man?\\
364 - Wait a minute.\\
365 - You accused Steven
of stealing your money?\\
366 - Well, yeah, but to be fair, Dad,\\
367 - that was before I
found out you stole it.\\
368 - Which brings up
why you didn't ask me,\\
369 - and also, you know,
you could've told me.\\
370 - Well, you could've.\\
371 - Okay.\\
372 - I'm sorry that I took some
money out of your little box.\\
373 - When I feed you and clothe you\\
374 - and put a roof over your head.\\
375 - Sorry.\\
376 - Now.\\
377 - How could you do that to Steven?\\
378 - He's your best friend.\\
379 - Well, he made a move on Donna.\\
380 - Oh, come on.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - Well, then, there's only
one thing that we can do.\\
383 - Nine rounds
of bare-knuckle boxing.\\
384 - Come on.\\
385 - Help me move the couch.\\
386 - Wait, uh, Dad, I don't...\\
387 - Oh, no, no, no.
I'll referee.\\
388 - Believe me, when it's
over, you'll both feel great.\\
389 - I know I will.\\
390 - - Red...
- Look.\\
391 - If you're not mad enough to
bare-knuckle box, then you're not mad.\\
392 - Now, both of you need
to just get the hell over it.\\
393 - Once again, Red's simple,
earthy wisdom saves the day.\\
394 - Yeah, ain't he a peach?\\
395 - Look, Hyde.\\
396 - I just...\\
397 - God, I am so sorry.\\
398 - You know what, man?\\
399 - You either forgive me for what
happened with Donna, or you don't.\\
400 - You can't keep
throwing that in my face.\\
401 - Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.\\
402 - Um, it's over.\\
403 - I'm never gonna bring
it up again. I promise.\\
404 - Yeah, all right.\\
405 - Whoa.\\
406 - Man, she got you this watch,\\
407 - and all you got her
were those crappy flowers?\\
408 - You loser!\\
409 - You're the loser.\\
410 - Yeah!
Dance, baby, dance!\\
411 - Go, Jackie!\\
412 - Looking good, baby!
\subsection {Episode 13: Hunting}
1 - Hey, look at this.\\
2 - It's the first day
of deer season.\\
3 - - Rabbit season.
- Duck season.\\
4 - - Rabbit season.
- Duck season.\\
5 - - "Wabbit" season.
- Duck season.\\
6 - Well, Red, you haven't
been hunting in ages.\\
7 - Not since the accident.\\
8 - What accident?\\
9 - The really terrible accident\\
10 - that's none of your business.\\
11 - Oh, yeah.
That one.\\
12 - You know, why don't you go?\\
13 - It might be fun. Get out of
the house, get some fresh air,\\
14 - maybe get out of
your lousy damn mood.\\
15 - Sorry.\\
16 - I'd love to go, Kitty,\\
17 - but we just can't afford it.\\
18 - Oh, yes, we can.
I will pack you some food\\
19 - and a nice box of bullets,\\
20 - and you're on your way.\\
21 - Dad, you could use
the Pinciottis' cabin.\\
22 - Bob has a cabin?\\
23 - Well, isn't that
just the cat's ass.\\
24 - Oh, boo-hoo, the world's unfair.\\
25 - Now just ask Bob if you
can borrow his cabin.\\
26 - Okay, we'll go.
Just us guys.\\
27 - Uh, Mom?\\
28 - Well, you should go.
You don't spend\\
29 - nearly enough time
with your father.\\
30 - That's because
he doesn't like me.\\
31 - Yes, he does like you.
And that's no excuse.\\
32 - Well, I don't have a gun.\\
33 - My mom took it when she left.\\
34 - Well, you can share.
You know,\\
35 - there is something about a gun\\
36 - that just makes you
want to share.\\
37 - Okay, fine, Mom.
I'll go with Dad,\\
38 - but if I don't come back,\\
39 - you'll know who did it.\\
40 - You know, he's never
really warmed up to you.\\
41 - Going on 17 years now.\\
42 - Okay, we're going hunting.\\
43 - Well, yay!\\
44 - With Bob.\\
45 - Oh.\\
46 - Well, you know,
maybe you'll cheer up\\
47 - after you shoot something.\\
48 - I always do.\\
49 - Hangin' out\\
50 - Down the street\\
51 - The same old thing\\
52 - We did last week\\
53 - Not a thing to do\\
54 - But talk to you\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
58 - Hey, Red, don't freak out,\\
59 - but if I see a deer\\
60 - on the side of the road,\\
61 - I'm gonna shoot him.\\
62 - Kelso, you fire
that gun in this car\\
63 - and I will pull over\\
64 - and kick your ass for an hour.\\
65 - Do it, Red, do it!\\
66 - Come on, Forman,\\
67 - would you get that gun
away from him?\\
68 - No, I want to hold it.\\
69 - Give it up, Kelso.\\
70 - I have a right to
bear arms, all right?\\
71 - That's in the Constitution.\\
72 - Kelso, not everything in the
Constitution makes sense.\\
73 - Whoa, Fez. Shut up.\\
74 - What did you say?\\
75 - Uh, nothing.\\
76 - - Foreigners.
- I hear you.\\
77 - So, so, so.\\
78 - What to do?\\
79 - I should have gone hunting.\\
80 - No, no, no.
We can have fun.\\
81 - We can have our very own fun.\\
82 - We could...\\
83 - - I'm not
baking anything.
- Aw!\\
84 - Okay, who wants Jell-O?\\
85 - Jell-O's baking.\\
86 - No, no, no.\\
87 - Jell-O's boiling.\\
88 - Gotcha.\\
89 - Hey, Red.
So tell me\\
90 - about that hunting accident.\\
91 - It sounds like a funny story.\\
92 - Think we'll see any bears?\\
93 - I'd love to kill a bear.\\
94 - You can't shoot a bear,\\
95 - it's deer season.\\
96 - You shoot a bear,\\
97 - you get fined, you go to jail.\\
98 - No, I'll just say
it was self-defense.\\
99 - Who is the jury gonna believe,\\
100 - me or a dead bear?\\
101 - - A dead bear.
- A dead bear.\\
102 - I killed a bear once.\\
103 - Your ass.\\
104 - I did. I did.\\
105 - I was getting a drink
from a stream, see,\\
106 - when suddenly I heard something.\\
107 - Grabbed my shotgun, boom.\\
108 - Right between the eyes.\\
109 - Survival.\\
110 - So what did you do then?\\
111 - You, uh, bring it
home? Get it stuffed?\\
112 - Nope. Left it there.
Went home.\\
113 - How come you
didn't bring it home?\\
114 - Get it stuffed?\\
115 - On account it was so huge.\\
116 - So it's a stand-off.\\
117 - I won't shave my legs,
Bob won't shave his back.\\
118 - Okay, ew!\\
119 - You know, Red doesn't
have a hairy back,\\
120 - and thank God
for that. No offense.\\
121 - Good news for you, Donna.\\
122 - That means Eric probably
won't have one either.\\
123 - He can't even grow a mustache.\\
124 - Oh, please.
Eric's body\\
125 - is bald as can be.\\
126 - You know, I don't even think\\
127 - he hit puberty until about 15.\\
128 - Really?\\
129 - Oh, he probably won't
like that I said that.\\
130 - I think Eric's the sweetest kid.\\
131 - So, Donna, have you and Eric...\\
132 - Mother, please!\\
133 - The answer's no.\\
134 - Hey, hey.\\
135 - Everybody just shut up.\\
136 - Well, I for one am not so naive\\
137 - as to think that you and Eric...\\
138 - Ahhh!\\
139 - Okay, well, I guess
we're upsetting her,\\
140 - so what should we do now?\\
141 - Well, if Donna wasn't so
uptight, we could talk about...\\
142 - I'm gonna go home.\\
143 - Do you want me to
go home? 'Cause I will.\\
144 - Donna, please don't go home.\\
145 - I think it's very nice\\
146 - that you're spending
time with your mother.\\
147 - God knows, Laurie won't.\\
148 - You guys, let's play poker.\\
149 - I bet I'm good at it.\\
150 - You never played poker before?\\
151 - Uh-uh, but I have lots of money.\\
152 - Oh, well, honey.
Have a seat.\\
153 - I'll get the cards.\\
154 - Oh, my God.\\
155 - Damn!\\
156 - Damn.
Damn it all! Damn!\\
157 - Kelso, what the
hell are you doing?\\
158 - Well, I would be
proudly standing\\
159 - over my kill right now\\
160 - if someone hadn't
taken my gun away.\\
161 - Kelso, you can't fire
the gun in the camp.\\
162 - The deer walked
right through here.\\
163 - He was mine.
I was gonna hunt him.\\
164 - You know, Kelso, not
every hunting accident\\
165 - is an accident.\\
166 - I think you'd better\\
167 - sit this one out, pal.\\
168 - Fine.\\
169 - You know, I saw a
deer blind on the way in.\\
170 - Anybody want to go check it out?\\
171 - I'll go.\\
172 - No, not me.\\
173 - I just came to hang out.\\
174 - When I crave meat,
I buy bologna.\\
175 - So, where's Fez?\\
176 - Kelso probably shot him.\\
177 - No, no, no. I saw him\\
178 - walking into the woods
right after we got here.\\
179 - Said he was going hunting.\\
180 - He had a whistle and a stick.\\
181 - Oh, that crazy foreign bastard.\\
182 - Let's eat.\\
183 - Wow, those were some
delicious birds.\\
184 - Key chain?\\
185 - No, I'm good.\\
186 - So you caught those birds\\
187 - with just a whistle and a stick?\\
188 - Very impressive, Fez.\\
189 - Yeah, you know,
that's a good way to hunt,\\
190 - 'cause even if you
don't get anything,\\
191 - you still have all the fun\\
192 - of a whistle and a stick.\\
193 - I'll take the key chain. Give
it to Midge. Little memento.\\
194 - I feel good about that, Bob.\\
195 - Midge is nice.\\
196 - Yep, we all like Midge.\\
197 - Yeah, Midge has nice jugs.\\
198 - What?\\
199 - What?\\
200 - No, you said something.\\
201 - No, I didn't.\\
202 - So, what's up
with your hair, huh?\\
203 - Man, I am at one
with nature right now.\\
204 - Thanks for the pheasant, Fez.\\
205 - Pheasant, Fez.
Pheasant, Fez.\\
206 - Yes, beautiful black pheasants.\\
207 - Black pheasants.\\
208 - Wait, pheasants aren't black.\\
209 - Yeah, black is beautiful.
I wish Jackie was black.\\
210 - What did you feed us, Fez?\\
211 - They were pheasants.
They went, "Coo-caw."\\
212 - "Coo-caw."\\
213 - You fed us a crow?\\
214 - You're not supposed
to eat a crow, man.\\
215 - You just brought some
bad ju-ju on us all.\\
216 - We ate somebody's soul, man.\\
217 - I know. I have eaten
someone's delicious soul.\\
218 - Hey, good news, guys.
I found my gun.\\
219 - What? It's probably
not loaded.\\
220 - Oh, wow, Mom.
You're not good.\\
221 - Well, you're not even playing\\
222 - so keep it to yourself,
Ms. Smarty.\\
223 - Okay, I'll play.\\
224 - You want to play
cards with your mother?\\
225 - Sure.\\
226 - Well, I am gonna call\\
227 - the Milwaukee Journal.\\
228 - Kitty? How many kings
are in a pack?\\
229 - Four.\\
230 - I bet $1.00.\\
231 - Well, um, I see that there are\\
232 - four queens in a deck, too.\\
233 - Oh, Mom.
That is so pathetic.\\
234 - Fine, I fold.\\
235 - I'm in.\\
236 - Okay, uh, do you want any cards?\\
237 - Yeah, can I have
two fives, please?\\
238 - And I'll have one card.\\
239 - Oh, it's a five.
Jackie, did you want this?\\
240 - You gave her a five?\\
241 - I thought we were friends.\\
242 - Okay, you know what?\\
243 - Everybody just show your cards.\\
244 - Okay, did I win?
Did I win? Did I win?\\
245 - Not even close.\\
246 - Oh. Well, I don't care.\\
247 - I don't work, so money doesn't\\
248 - really mean anything to me.\\
249 - Oh, how nice for you.\\
250 - Hey, Dad. I don't
know about you,\\
251 - but I'm kind of
frozen to the blind.\\
252 - Right in the pants area.\\
253 - Shh. Jeez, you have
done nothing but complain\\
254 - since we got here.\\
255 - You know, I was hoping
that this trip\\
256 - would be better than the last,\\
257 - where you cried about
every stupid thing.\\
258 - I was six.\\
259 - And you made me
touch a dead rabbit.\\
260 - I just thought that
if you touched it,\\
261 - you might not be afraid of it.\\
262 - Well, thank you,
Dr. Spock.\\
263 - Making noise is not
the way to bag a deer.\\
264 - I had nightmares for a month.\\
265 - Big, dead, rabbit nightmares.\\
266 - Oh, man. We got one.
He is huge.\\
267 - Where?
I don't see it.\\
268 - It's about a quarter click\\
269 - south of the clearing.\\
270 - What is a click?\\
271 - And which way is south?\\
272 - Oh, no, wait, okay, I see him.\\
273 - Yeah. Oh,
you're right, Dad.\\
274 - He is huge.\\
275 - You're not kidding.\\
276 - I'd say he's a 10-pointer.\\
277 - What?\\
278 - I was just thinking.
You take the shot.\\
279 - No way. You always
talk about\\
280 - getting a buck.
You do it.\\
281 - No, damn it. Now
don't argue with me.\\
282 - Now take the shot.\\
283 - Come on. Hurry up.\\
284 - Oh, and don't
shoot him in the face.\\
285 - Holy cow, look at him go.\\
286 - Man, you really stink.\\
287 - I told you to take the shot.\\
288 - Well, I just thought
it would be nice\\
289 - for you to get a deer.
I mean...\\
290 - God knows, I'd love to get one.\\
291 - Then you should have
taken the shot.\\
292 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
293 - Why are you always
so damn nervous?\\
294 - Oh, hmm, I don't know.\\
295 - Maybe it's because
you've been yelling at me\\
296 - for 17 years?\\
297 - Oh, I have not.\\
298 - Oh, God, he was right there.\\
299 - I could have hit him
with a rock.\\
300 - Yep, that's a damn shame.\\
301 - So are you ready to head back?\\
302 - No, I sure as hell
am not ready to head back.\\
303 - You want to go back?
You go back.\\
304 - So.\\
305 - Hey, Dad. How
about a war story?\\
306 - Yeah, okay.\\
307 - Did I ever tell you
about the time\\
308 - I didn't miss that North Korean?\\
309 - Full house.
Jacks over 10s.\\
310 - Mom wins again.\\
311 - Well, this is fun,
isn't this fun?\\
312 - It was fun till Laurie
started dealing.\\
313 - Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?\\
314 - Oh, my gosh. I think
Mrs. Pinciotti is saying\\
315 - that Laurie's cheating.\\
316 - No, she's not.\\
317 - Wait. Yes, I am.\\
318 - My daughter does not cheat.\\
319 - Come on, Donna. We're
storming out of here.\\
320 - Okay, see ya.\\
321 - Hold on.
I'll storm with you.\\
322 - Thank you for a lovely
afternoon, Mrs. Forman.\\
323 - Laurie, were you cheating?\\
324 - You can't prove anything.\\
325 - Oh, for God's sake.\\
326 - Okay. Well, if you weren't
such a crappy card player,\\
327 - then I wouldn't
have had to cheat.\\
328 - And you were gonna lose all your
mad money, and Midge bugs me.\\
329 - You were cheating
so I would win.\\
330 - Duh! I wanted you
to have a little fun.\\
331 - Well...\\
332 - Gosh, that's sweet.\\
333 - Yeah.\\
334 - I love you, Mommy.\\
335 - I just know I wouldn't
have missed him.\\
336 - Not when he was
that close. No way.\\
337 - Here.\\
338 - Dad, you see the can
by that clearing?\\
339 - Yeah.\\
340 - I don't believe it.
How'd you do that?\\
341 - Dad, I know how to shoot.\\
342 - Don't you remember
my Taxi Driver phase?\\
343 - I didn't want to kill him.\\
344 - I missed on purpose.\\
345 - Well, I can respect that more\\
346 - than you being a crappy shot.\\
347 - - What?
- Why didn't you say so?\\
348 - Why do you think?\\
349 - You really think I've been
yelling at you for 17 years?\\
350 - No.\\
351 - You were probably
okay with me as an infant.\\
352 - I just can't remember.\\
353 - Boy, it was right around 13\\
354 - when you started
getting a little lippy.\\
355 - And twitchy.\\
356 - Well, you know,
lippy and twitchy\\
357 - tend to walk hand-in-hand, so...\\
358 - See?
Now that's lippy.\\
359 - You got something you want
to say to me, you just say it.\\
360 - Dad...\\
361 - No, I'm serious here.\\
362 - Just for a second, pretend
that I'm not your dad.\\
363 - I want you to tell me what
you really think of me.\\
364 - How about let's do this\\
365 - when you don't have a gun?\\
366 - How about you do what the
guy with the gun tells you to do?\\
367 - Okay.\\
368 - I think you're angry\\
369 - because life didn't turn out\\
370 - exactly the way
you wanted it to,\\
371 - and, uh, maybe you
think if you yell at me,\\
372 - I won't let life
push me around, too.\\
373 - You came up with
that answer awful fast.\\
374 - Well...\\
375 - Hell, Eric.
Maybe you'll be okay.\\
376 - Oh, my God.
Dad, he's back.\\
377 - Oh, look at him.
He's magnificent.\\
378 - He's the king of the forest.\\
379 - Just like...\\
380 - Bambi's dad.\\
381 - He's beautiful.\\
382 - Yeah, and I'll bet
he tastes beautiful, too.\\
383 - Oh, uh, just for
the record, Eric.\\
384 - I'm the king of the forest.\\
385 - Way to go, Dad. You
finally got your buck.\\
386 - I wish it was mine,\\
387 - but somebody took my gun away\\
388 - 'cause he sensed what
a great hunter I am.\\
389 - Kelso, if we let you
keep your gun,\\
390 - Fez would be the one strapped
to that hood right now.\\
391 - Hey, Red. So, uh,
about that accident, huh?\\
392 - Ah, yeah. Well, it
was a long time ago.\\
393 - I was out, uh,
hunting with Frank.\\
394 - He was a good friend of mine,
a good guy.\\
395 - Kind of a dumb-ass
like Kelso here.\\
396 - So anyway, Frank
had shot this deer,\\
397 - and he was real happy,\\
398 - and he'd had a few beers\\
399 - so he was dancing around,\\
400 - and it was all real fun,\\
401 - and then he leans over
to kiss the deer,\\
402 - only the deer's not dead yet,\\
403 - and it kicks him
right in the neck.\\
404 - And it killed him.\\
405 - The deer is staring at my soul.\\
406 - Put some sunglasses on it.\\
407 - Well, this is just delicious.\\
408 - Sorry about the buck shot.\\
409 - Oh, I don't mind.
I mean,\\
410 - there's usually some
mystery gristle in meat.\\
411 - At least we know what it is.\\
412 - I like it better
when you fish, Daddy.\\
413 - It was jerking around, so, uh,
Eric shot it with the shotgun.\\
414 - Well, I had to.
It was\\
415 - screaming.\\
416 - Killed a raccoon once.\\
417 - Hit him with my uncle's car.\\
418 - So bad.\\
419 - All right.
Settle down, killer.\\
420 - Yeah. Sounds like
we're all a bunch\\
421 - of real killers.\\
422 - Good God.
Crack a window.\\
423 - Whew!\\
424 - That is unpleasant.\\
425 - Son of a bitch!
\subsection {Episode 14: Red Gets a Job}
1 - So, let's get
to the loving, huh?\\
2 - So, how about a little
mood music, huh?\\
3 - Zeppelin or Foghat?\\
4 - Whatever.\\
5 - Are you okay?\\
6 - I'm sorry. I guess I'm
just not into it today.\\
7 - Actually, I feel like talking.\\
8 - Oh, okay, yeah.
I'll try anything once.\\
9 - Well, it's just...\\
10 - Lately I feel like all
my friends are away at school\\
11 - and I'm the only one here and
I just feel like this huge failure.\\
12 - Laurie, don't be silly.\\
13 - Failures are ugly,
and you're hot.\\
14 - That's true.\\
15 - Yeah.
Thanks, Kelso.\\
16 - Yeah.\\
17 - I guess it all started
in junior high.\\
18 - That's when a girl really
defines who she is.\\
19 - You know what I mean?\\
20 - So, we're talking some more?\\
21 - I really want to talk.\\
22 - Okay.\\
23 - Guess I'll put my shirt back
on so we can talk some more.\\
24 - Great.\\
25 - Yeah. Super.\\
26 - Look at this ad, Red.\\
27 - They're opening a Pricemart
right in our own town.\\
28 - $14.95 for a toaster.
Can you believe it?\\
29 - No, I can't.\\
30 - I bought that very same toaster\\
31 - in your store for twice that.\\
32 - Yeah, that's my point.\\
33 - That you screwed me?\\
34 - Red, $14.95 is
below my cost.\\
35 - This Pricemart could
put me out of business.\\
36 - Hey, they're hiring.\\
37 - Red, you can't.\\
38 - These giant corporations
come into town.\\
39 - They destroy little
businesses like mine.\\
40 - They're evil.\\
41 - Yeah, I guess that's true.\\
42 - Hangin' out\\
43 - Down the street\\
44 - The same old thing\\
45 - We did last week\\
46 - Not a thing to do\\
47 - But talk to you\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - Where is the food?\\
52 - Eric, you should give
your refrigerator\\
53 - to people who have food.\\
54 - Look at this.\\
55 - Hamburger Helper.
Tuna Helper.\\
56 - A can of beets?\\
57 - Oh, gross. I will not
eat a darn beet.\\
58 - You know what, Forman? Your
dad better get a job, and soon.\\
59 - 'Cause I'm starving here.\\
60 - I'll tell him you said that.\\
61 - Michael, it's not polite
to remind poor people\\
62 - that they're po...\\
63 - Less fortunate.\\
64 - We're not less fortunate.\\
65 - We're just on a budget.\\
66 - Well, it is a hell of a tiny
budget.\\
67 - Oh, that's not funny.
That's sad.\\
68 - Hey, Kelso, eat that.\\
69 - All right. Green Jell-O.\\
70 - Hey, Jackie, try some. I heard
green stuff makes you horny.\\
71 - Michael, that only works
with green M&M's, duh.\\
72 - Nuh-uh. It's
everything green.\\
73 - Right, Donna?\\
74 - Actually, Kelso,\\
75 - you know what really
makes you horny?\\
76 - Beets.\\
77 - Yeah, right.\\
78 - No, it's true. I saw it
on 60 Minutes, man.\\
79 - Beet farmers with,
like, 10, 15 kids.\\
80 - Man, how's come everything
good for you always tastes so bad.\\
81 - I'm trying it.\\
82 - Michael, honey,
don't eat our beets.\\
83 - Yeah, you know, Michael,
Mrs. Forman's right.\\
84 - You're horny enough as it is.\\
85 - Sometimes, I wish
you had two girlfriends.\\
86 - Oh, my God.
Are you serious?\\
87 - I get it, Bob.\\
88 - Kitty, I'm getting
a job at Pricemart.\\
89 - And I guess I've just
been too concerned\\
90 - with the needs of others\\
91 - and I haven't thought
enough about myself.\\
92 - Kelso?
Yeah?\\
93 - Yeah.
Listening.\\
94 - So, what do you think?\\
95 - Well, uh, I...\\
96 - Agree?\\
97 - Really?
Yeah!\\
98 - Okay, I mean, everything
you said makes so much sense.\\
99 - So, who wants sex? I
know I do!\\
100 - Kelso, I'm feeling
really close to you and\\
101 - I think I want a relationship.\\
102 - Yes. That's what I want.\\
103 - A sexual relationship.\\
104 - No, no, I mean I want
more from you than just sex.\\
105 - Don't be silly, Laurie.
Sex is enough for any woman.\\
106 - Kelso, I want an
emotional relationship.\\
107 - Exactly! We both want a
sexually emotional relationship.\\
108 - This Pricemart looks like
a heck of an outfit, Kitty.\\
109 - Yeah, maybe I should go
down there and get a job too.\\
110 - When your father's in a
good mood, what do I say?\\
111 - No talking?\\
112 - Thank you.\\
113 - Eric, I've told you.\\
114 - Your job is to study hard,\\
115 - get good grades,
get a scholarship,\\
116 - go to college and move away.\\
117 - End of discussion.\\
118 - Then how come Hyde
gets to have a job?\\
119 - Because, Forman,
you have potential.\\
120 - Whereas I'll be a
success if I stay out of jail.\\
121 - Exactly!\\
122 - Oh, no, Steven,
that is not true.\\
123 - It's just it's
a little different\\
124 - because he doesn't
have any parents.\\
125 - Oh, my God. I don't
have any parents?\\
126 - Okay, okay.
Wish me luck.\\
127 - Okay, good luck, honey.
Good luck.\\
128 - Knock 'em dead.\\
129 - Man, what's his problem? I
just, I just want to help out.\\
130 - Well, I am sorry, Eric,
but I agree with your father.\\
131 - School is your job.\\
132 - Oh and...\\
133 - Also to be my precious
little baby boy.\\
134 - Mom! We talked
about this.\\
135 - I'm not a boy
anymore. I'm a man.\\
136 - Shut up, Hyde.
I am a man!\\
137 - Fine.\\
138 - My precious little baby man.\\
139 - Oh, man.\\
140 - You are so lucky your
mom's a runaway alcoholic.\\
141 - I must say, Red. I am very
impressed with your experience.\\
142 - Well, thank you,
Mr. Herbison.\\
143 - Oh, call me Ted, Red.\\
144 - Hey, Ted, Red. That's
funny.\\
145 - Oh, yeah. It is.\\
146 - I didn't catch
it there at first,\\
147 - but then whoop! That's
funny.\\
148 - Now I see you're applying
for our supervisor position.\\
149 - What would you say if I
offered you a job right now?\\
150 - I'd say let's break
out the champale.\\
151 - Great, 'cause we're
hiring cashiers.\\
152 - You get your own smock.\\
153 - I'm not a cashier, Ted.\\
154 - I'm management.\\
155 - Okay. Then we'll
let you know.\\
156 - So, uh, Red, Ted. That's
pretty funny, though.\\
157 - On second thought,
it's not that funny.\\
158 - Red, come and eat your dinner.\\
159 - Shh!
Not hungry.\\
160 - Hey, what's going on?\\
161 - Shh! Red's waiting
for a phone call.\\
162 - Oh.\\
163 - Shh!\\
164 - You know, that phone
hasn't rung all damn day.\\
165 - Maybe it's broken.
No, it's not broken.\\
166 - No, it's not broken.\\
167 - Oh! Damn! They could
have called right then,\\
168 - got a busy signal, moved
on to the next guy on the list.\\
169 - Oh, man! I just screwed
myself out of a job!\\
170 - Wait, Red! Wait!
Let it ring.\\
171 - You don't want
to seem desperate.\\
172 - Right.\\
173 - Eric, if this is one of
your dumb-ass friends,\\
174 - you better start running.\\
175 - Please don't be Kelso.
Please don't be Kelso.\\
176 - Hello.\\
177 - It's Pricemart!\\
178 - Yes.\\
179 - This is the Forman residence.\\
180 - You have good news?\\
181 - Yeah.
Uh-huh.\\
182 - Uh-huh.\\
183 - Okay then.
Thanks for calling.\\
184 - So what's the good news?\\
185 - The good news is\\
186 - Eric got a job at Pricemart.\\
187 - Run, honey. Run.\\
188 - Man, Red went ballistic on me.\\
189 - I mean I want to keep
the job, but\\
190 - I really don't want to
wear my ass for a hat.\\
191 - 'Cause, you know,\\
192 - he said he could do
that and I believe him.\\
193 - Come on, Forman.
Fight the power, man.\\
194 - That way I can have your
room after Red kills you.\\
195 - Although I'm not sure
an ass hat is fatal.\\
196 - You know what would
be a good job for me?\\
197 - Gigolo.\\
198 - The loving is over, now pay me.\\
199 - So, Laurie's been talking
a lot lately, right?\\
200 - She's saying she
wants a relationship.\\
201 - You know, and I kept
waiting for the dirty part,\\
202 - but the dirty part never came.\\
203 - Kelso, I have a real
problem here, okay?\\
204 - I'd like to talk about that.\\
205 - Right.\\
206 - You know, dating two girls
wasn't supposed to be like this.\\
207 - You know, it was
supposed to be like...\\
208 - So, do you want to talk?\\
209 - No way, I
just want to fool around.\\
210 - Yeah. Yeah.
Yes!\\
211 - Oh, talking is stupid.\\
212 - You know, I'll just wait quietly\\
213 - until you and Laurie are done.\\
214 - Have fun.\\
215 - Well, thanks, babe.\\
216 - You know what?
Feel free to jump in.\\
217 - Hey, Kelso, you mind if I
join in your sexy circle, too?\\
218 - Well, why not?\\
219 - All Eric ever
wants to do is talk.\\
220 - I told you he was a loser.\\
221 - I know. I mean, how
am I supposed to talk\\
222 - when I don't have a thought
in my pretty little red head?\\
223 - See, Michael?\\
224 - Donna's just as
empty-headed as we are.\\
225 - Oh, Donna, you'll
make a great addition\\
226 - to our sexy circle.\\
227 - All right, ladies. There's
just one rule here.\\
228 - There are no bras allowed.\\
229 - Yay!\\
230 - See, that's pretty sweet, huh?\\
231 - What do you think?\\
232 - I think it makes
your ass look big.\\
233 - You know, I just don't know why
my dad doesn't want me to work.\\
234 - I mean, yeah,
I'm a real bad boy, Donna.\\
235 - My big teenage rebellion
is to get a job.\\
236 - Ooh, you never know what
I'm going to do next.\\
237 - Oh, my God, look out.\\
238 - He's got insurance.\\
239 - You know I think it'll be
great when you get a job.\\
240 - Maybe on our dates we
won't have to just sit in the car.\\
241 - Maybe we can actually
drive somewhere\\
242 - and maybe, I don't know, eat?\\
243 - Or maybe I can get my
own popcorn at the movies.\\
244 - You're a dreamer.\\
245 - Yeah, you know what?\\
246 - I'm going to keep the job.\\
247 - Whoa, you're like
a rebel without a cause.\\
248 - But with a cause.\\
249 - And a smock.
Right.\\
250 - You got to hide me.\\
251 - Kelso,
are you down there?\\
252 - I'm not here.\\
253 - Have you seen Kelso?\\
254 - Why, yes, I have. He's
hiding from you in the shower.\\
255 - Oh!\\
256 - Hi.\\
257 - Guess what! I just found
my eighth grade diary.\\
258 - Come on, I'll read it to you.\\
259 - Great!\\
260 - Hey, Forman.\\
261 - Good news, Red.\\
262 - I just took Cosmo's "10 ways
to please your man in bed" test\\
263 - and I got 9 out of 10.\\
264 - But I didn't get number three
because I'm a nurse\\
265 - and number three is icky.\\
266 - I can't believe that Eric.\\
267 - Oh, I think working is
important to Eric's self-esteem,\\
268 - and I really don't think
it's a big deal.\\
269 - But he only got a job, Kitty,
because I don't have one.\\
270 - And no son of mine
is going to work\\
271 - and screw up his chances
to go to a good college\\
272 - 'cause I can't carry the load.\\
273 - I should have taken
that crummy cashier's job.\\
274 - Oh, now what kind
of talk is that?\\
275 - You deserve to be supervisor.\\
276 - In fact, the Red Forman I know\\
277 - would march right
down there and fight for it.\\
278 - I've been out of work
for six months.\\
279 - I can't afford to
fight right now, Kitty.\\
280 - I've got to take
their crappy offer\\
281 - and smile like
a jackass while I do it.\\
282 - Red, I don't think
your smile is going to...\\
283 - Oh, I'm going for a walk.\\
284 - Well, wait a minute, honey.\\
285 - You know what, we
can split a bottle of wine\\
286 - and I'll give
number three a shot.\\
287 - That was a close one.\\
288 - Did you quit that job?\\
289 - Dad, I want to keep that job.\\
290 - Well, it's a tough world,
Eric.\\
291 - And people don't always
get what they want.\\
292 - Especially you.\\
293 - Dad, I'm pretty sure I'm not
backing down on this one.\\
294 - You're not?\\
295 - Oh, no.\\
296 - Well, I guess you win, then.\\
297 - Dad, you always tell me
never to back down.\\
298 - "Don't back down."\\
299 - "Formans never back down."\\
300 - And now you're
telling me to back down?\\
301 - Well, Dad, I can only
conclude that you're insane.\\
302 - You think that's funny?\\
303 - Well, you know, maybe not
in the traditional "ha-ha" sense,\\
304 - but, you know, it's kind of...\\
305 - Look, I've got to go.\\
306 - You know, you're going to look
real funny when you're wearing...\\
307 - Your ass for a hat.\\
308 - Yeah!\\
309 - Even though I doubt
that's physically possible.\\
310 - Let's find out together.\\
311 - Okay, Laurie, I want you to know\\
312 - that I really, really, really\\
313 - enjoy fooling around with you.\\
314 - Yeah, I get that a lot.\\
315 - And you should.
'Cause you're talented.\\
316 - See, but I don't want
one of those relationships\\
317 - because I already have
one of those with Jackie.\\
318 - But that can't last.\\
319 - No.\\
320 - See, what I'm saying is,\\
321 - is that we have to break
this thing off.\\
322 - That's a pretty big decision
to make all on your own.\\
323 - Maybe you and me and Jackie\\
324 - should all get together
and discuss it.\\
325 - No. You wouldn't.\\
326 - Really?\\
327 - Look at me, Kelso.\\
328 - Look into my eyes.\\
329 - Laurie, will you go out with me?\\
330 - Oh, Kelso. I thought
you'd never ask.\\
331 - It's a smart move,
taking cashier.\\
332 - I know you were gunning
for supervisor, but...\\
333 - Hey, there's no shame
in backing down.\\
334 - Well, that is
a mighty nice smock.\\
335 - You know,\\
336 - you think that your kids
don't listen to you. But they do.\\
337 - I'm not sure I follow.\\
338 - I changed my mind, Ted.\\
339 - I'm here for
the supervisor's job.\\
340 - You know what I mean?\\
341 - Ted?\\
342 - Okay, well, now your
father should be back\\
343 - from his interview
any minute now.\\
344 - Mom, how come we
have to be here?\\
345 - I could be using this time to...\\
346 - Not be here.\\
347 - No, this is a very
difficult day for your father\\
348 - and he needs to be
with his family.\\
349 - I'll be in the
basement. No, you sit!\\
350 - Oh, sure, when things get
ugly, suddenly I'm family.\\
351 - Not to me, freak.\\
352 - You are so going
to end up in porno.\\
353 - Hi, honey.\\
354 - Right to the bar.
Not a good sign.\\
355 - What are you all looking at?\\
356 - Don't you think that\\
357 - Pricemart's new supervisor
deserves a drink?\\
358 - Yay!\\
359 - Yeah, I got it.\\
360 - Congratulations, Dad.\\
361 - Thanks, Eric.\\
362 - Oh, and you're fired!\\
363 - What?
You can't do that.\\
364 - Yes, I can.
You're fired!\\
365 - Hey, you know what?
I'm not fired.\\
366 - Okay, if it's so important
to you, you're not fired.\\
367 - But if your grades
start to slip,\\
368 - you are fired!\\
369 - I love saying that.\\
370 - God help the poor bastards
who work for you, huh?\\
371 - Wait, uh, I work for you.\\
372 - I know.\\
373 - So, dad, you and me
going to work together.\\
374 - What a nightmare, huh?\\
375 - Oh, would you look at that?\\
376 - They spelled your name wrong.\\
377 - Just doesn't get old, does it?\\
378 - Well, if it isn't
Benedict and Arnold.\\
379 - Bob, I needed that job
and if you can't get that,\\
380 - well, I'm sorry.
You're a dumb-ass.\\
381 - Look, they misspelled Pricemart.\\
382 - You want to keep that finger?\\
383 - Uh-huh.\\
384 - You've got to stop
goofing around, Kelso.\\
385 - Am I right, Jackie?\\
386 - Laurie is so right, Michael.\\
387 - We are very disappointed in you.\\
388 - Even Eric got a job.\\
389 - Yeah, even my stupid
brother got a job.\\
390 - Yeah, her brother's stupid
and he got a job.\\
391 - Sexy circle?\\
392 - Oh!
\subsection {Episode 15: Burning Down the House}
1 - Oh, rerun's not smart.\\
2 - "What's happening?" I'll tell
you what's happening. Hilarity.\\
3 - Yeah, no kidding.\\
4 - "Hey, hey, hey."\\
5 - That's just funny.\\
6 - Hey, hey, can you guys, uh,
keep it down a bit, please?\\
7 - Hyde, there's lipstick
on your chin.\\
8 - Hyde, why are you
putting lipstick on your chin?\\
9 - It's for your lips.\\
10 - Hey, maybe he's got
a girl back there.\\
11 - So, Hyde, who's the lucky lady?\\
12 - I never kiss and tell.\\
13 - It's Kat Peterson.\\
14 - Yeah, right.\\
15 - You're in your bedroom with
the most popular girl in school.\\
16 - Yeah. What happened to Farrah
Fawcett? Did her car break down?\\
17 - Look. Just keep it down, all
right? You're killing the mood.\\
18 - Hyde, there is no mood
because no one's back there.\\
19 - Hey, Mike. Muah.\\
20 - Okay, so we're all set
for our big dinner party.\\
21 - Oh, yay, the big dinner party.\\
22 - So here.\\
23 - "You and a guest are cordially invited for
an evening of cocktails, dinner and TV."\\
24 - The attire is
semi-formal casual.\\
25 - Ah, finally, I can wear
my tuxedo t-shirt.\\
26 - Uh, sorry, Fez. I forgot
to invite you and Hyde.\\
27 - Oh, but it's never too late.\\
28 - Okay, bye.\\
29 - Don't worry, Fez. I'm sure
you and Hyde can come.\\
30 - No, Michael, they can't.\\
31 - Okay, I get it.
They can't come.\\
32 - Come with me.\\
33 - - No!
- Ah!\\
34 - Okay, I'll give you
a hundred bucks\\
35 - if you don't make me
go to this party.\\
36 - - Show me the hundred.
- Damn!\\
37 - Well, the party's
tomorrow night.\\
38 - So I better go home and
start putting on cologne now.\\
39 - So, that was fun.\\
40 - No. Disneyland's fun.
That was nasty.\\
41 - Oh, my God, Hyde.\\
42 - Kat Peterson. Nice.\\
43 - Yep.\\
44 - She's slummin' it,
and I'm lovin' it.\\
45 - Hangin' out\\
46 - Down the street\\
47 - The same old thing\\
48 - We did last week\\
49 - Not a thing to do\\
50 - But talk to you\\
51 - We're all, all right\\
52 - We're all, all right\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - Red, honey, would you go to Bob
and Midge's and get my casserole dish?\\
55 - I'm making tuna surprise
tonight.\\
56 - Well, now that I know,
you've ruined the surprise.\\
57 - It's for Scrabble night.\\
58 - Bob and Midge love
tuna surprise.\\
59 - Yeah, but I don't love
Bob and Midge.\\
60 - Well, Red, I have
to invite them over.\\
61 - They keep inviting us.\\
62 - Well, that's because
you keep inviting them.\\
63 - Somebody's got to break
the chain, or it'll go on forever.\\
64 - Red, they're the only friends we
have since you made Phyllis cry.\\
65 - I didn't say anything
about Phyllis' weight\\
66 - that the whole room
didn't already know.\\
67 - Donna, I'm gonna have dinner
parties all the time\\
68 - when I'm Mrs. Michael Kelso
Esquire.\\
69 - Just think about it.\\
70 - - Do I have to?
- Oh, shh.\\
71 - So they sprinkled moondust
In your hair\\
72 - And golden starlight
In your eyes of blue\\
73 - They're brown.\\
74 - I know.\\
75 - Oh, Kelso, you little so and so.\\
76 - I'd nary a notion of
your songbird ways,\\
77 - having thought you merely
a captain of industry\\
78 - and a king among men.\\
79 - My word.\\
80 - Cease your fawning and
let us discuss the fox hunt.\\
81 - But first, I crave a French
pastry. Where's the help?\\
82 - Apologies, good sire.\\
83 - I was in the stables
brushing the horses,\\
84 - secretly entertaining notions
of a sensual tryst with a lady.\\
85 - Top drawer!\\
86 - Top drawer.\\
87 - "Top drawer."\\
88 - Hello?\\
89 - Oh, hey, Bob.\\
90 - Oh, hi, Red.\\
91 - Stop it!\\
92 - You know what might make
this party a little more fun?\\
93 - Sweet death.\\
94 - Hyde!\\
95 - Fez!\\
96 - Michael!\\
97 - Oh, good.
It's Hyde, Fez, and Michael.\\
98 - Hello, fellas.
What's to eat?\\
99 - Ah, are these melon balls
for anyone?\\
100 - Why are they here?\\
101 - I invited them because you're
always discussing manners,\\
102 - and I wanted to be mannerly.\\
103 - He's mannerly.\\
104 - Hey, Chuck.\\
105 - Oh, no. Chuck's here.\\
106 - Why, Michael? Why would
you invite all these people?\\
107 - Why would you do this?\\
108 - Well, I was thinking that if
a party of 10 people was fun,\\
109 - then a party of 30 people
would be twice as much fun.\\
110 - Michael, I didn't want
twice as much fun.\\
111 - I wanted a small, classy party.\\
112 - But, Jackie, just because
there's a couple more people\\
113 - doesn't mean it can't
still be classy.\\
114 - Hey, everybody,
I'm taking off my pants!\\
115 - No hair?\\
116 - None.\\
117 - Well, a little.\\
118 - Well, what are we
talking about here, Red?\\
119 - Is it like Ed Asner bald
or Charlie Brown bald?\\
120 - Jeez, Kitty, I don't know.
I barely looked.\\
121 - Okay, I need a visual aid.\\
122 - It was so uncomfortable.\\
123 - I mean, a toupee's
a pretty big lie, Kitty.\\
124 - Okay, here.\\
125 - Show me on Wooly Willy.\\
126 - Uh-huh.\\
127 - Okay, uh-huh.\\
128 - Really?\\
129 - Hey! Hey!\\
130 - Would it kill you
to use a coaster?\\
131 - Bunch of wild hooligans here.\\
132 - Oh, sorry, Red.\\
133 - Red. You know...\\
134 - It was gonna leave a ring.\\
135 - That's so true, Kitty.\\
136 - Eric, look,
this is not your house.\\
137 - You're not gonna get in trouble
for any of this, so loosen up.\\
138 - Yeah. I guess
I could do that.\\
139 - Oh, my God.\\
140 - It's like I'm seeing colors
I've never seen before.\\
141 - Hey, Kat.
Want a beer?\\
142 - No.\\
143 - Thanks.\\
144 - She just blew me off, man.\\
145 - You believe that?\\
146 - Yes, I do.\\
147 - I really, really do.\\
148 - Michael, are they drinking
out of my parents' crystal?\\
149 - Yeah, Jackie.\\
150 - They were trying to drink straight
from the bottle, and I said, no! No!\\
151 - Use the crystal
'cause it's classy.\\
152 - Michael, I'm gonna go
upstairs and feel sorry for myself.\\
153 - And you, you are gonna fix this.\\
154 - Fi... Fix it?\\
155 - Jackie, you're having
the party of the year here!\\
156 - Damn!
I do not get women!\\
157 - Yes, neither does Hyde,
right, Hyde?\\
158 - You okay?\\
159 - Donna, please. I really don't
want to talk about Michael.\\
160 - Okay, so what is your honest
opinion about Michael?\\
161 - Um, by honest, you mean...\\
162 - Donna, please learn to listen.\\
163 - Okay. Okay, fine.\\
164 - - Honestly?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
165 - You have certain
expectations of Kelso\\
166 - that may not be
entirely realistic.\\
167 - You want him to be
sophisticated and smart,\\
168 - but actually he's
unsophisticated and unsmart.\\
169 - Oh!\\
170 - Hey, you know, you guys are really
bringing down the make-out room.\\
171 - Well, I'm gonna have to pass.\\
172 - I've got nothing.\\
173 - Would you look at her, Fez?\\
174 - Acting like she's all hot stuff.\\
175 - So she's incredibly good-looking
and everyone likes her.\\
176 - I'm real impressed.\\
177 - Yeah, I know how it is.\\
178 - You know, you think
you know somebody,\\
179 - but then it turns out he lied about
making out with Kat Peterson.\\
180 - Hyde! Fez!\\
181 - What, is this a funeral?
Come on!\\
182 - Why aren't you guys
getting down?\\
183 - Well, I'm afraid Hyde is
way too lovesick to get down.\\
184 - Lovesick?
I don't love her, man.\\
185 - I just think we should be having
sex is all, 'cause she'd enjoy it.\\
186 - Hyde, I'm not a doctor,
but I play one on TV.\\
187 - But seriously, Hyde.\\
188 - This is a party!\\
189 - So loosen up, like me.\\
190 - Whoops-a-daisy.\\
191 - Man, I wish Jackie
would loosen up.\\
192 - She's throwing a great party
down here, and she's missing it.\\
193 - Kelso, you don't get it, huh?\\
194 - This party meant
the world to Jackie.\\
195 - And you crapped on it.\\
196 - All right, ease up
on Kelso, huh?\\
197 - Thanks, Hyde.\\
198 - Yeah, I mean, so you
did something horrible.\\
199 - But it's Jackie, so who cares?\\
200 - No. Wait.
What are you saying?\\
201 - I'm saying you burned
her, man, royally.\\
202 - Nice job.\\
203 - But, no, man!
I didn't want to burn her.\\
204 - I invited all these people
to make it fun\\
205 - so her party would be good.\\
206 - She didn't want a good party.\\
207 - She wanted her party.\\
208 - You know what?
You're right, Fez.\\
209 - All right, this party's over.
Everybody out!\\
210 - No. Kelso, what
are you saying, man?\\
211 - Think!\\
212 - You know what, guys?\\
213 - For the first time in my life,
I think I am thinking.\\
214 - You know, I'm in danger of ruining the
greatest thing that has ever happened to me.\\
215 - And I am not
gonna let that happen!\\
216 - Kelso...\\
217 - Do not interrupt me, all right?\\
218 - This is important.\\
219 - From now on, I'm gonna put
Jackie's needs first.\\
220 - And she is gonna be
so proud of me!\\
221 - Whoa!\\
222 - Whoa, man!
This is a rager!\\
223 - Give me your brandies.\\
224 - Whoa!\\
225 - Whoa!\\
226 - Gimme!\\
227 - Whoa!\\
228 - Donna, how dare you say
that about me and Michael?\\
229 - Jackie, you wanted
my honest opinion.\\
230 - You're honest opinion
that we're great together.\\
231 - Look, you are wrong
about Michael.\\
232 - He knows he made a mistake,\\
233 - and he's gonna make it up to me.\\
234 - You wait and see.\\
235 - Uh, Jackie...\\
236 - Where's the fire extinguisher?\\
237 - S-I-T.\\
238 - That's "sit."\\
239 - Oh my.\\
240 - Yes, it is, again.\\
241 - Yeah, Midgie's got quite a lead.\\
242 - Your turn, Red.\\
243 - Okay, fine.\\
244 - "Cueball."\\
245 - Ahem. I'm sorry, Bob.\\
246 - Sorry?\\
247 - Why apologize to me?\\
248 - I like billiards.\\
249 - Billiards are fun.\\
250 - Okay, so you all know.\\
251 - I don't know anything.\\
252 - I wear a toupee.\\
253 - Bob! If you tell them,
they'll know.\\
254 - I wear a rug.
So what?\\
255 - You know...\\
256 - I wish I had a toupee.\\
257 - You know, because, you know,
the way my hair is sometimes.\\
258 - Look, Bob, being bald isn't
something that a man has to hide from.\\
259 - A toupee is just silly.\\
260 - I keep telling him if he'd
grow as much hair on his head\\
261 - as he does on his back,
he'd have a full head of hair.\\
262 - Look, I know it's silly.\\
263 - I guess I'm vain.\\
264 - Every morning I wake up
wishing I had the courage\\
265 - to walk around looking like you.\\
266 - But I don't, Red.\\
267 - I don't.\\
268 - I guess that makes me
a bad person.\\
269 - Look, Bob, I didn't
mean to make...\\
270 - No, no. You know what?
No, you're right, Red.\\
271 - You're right.\\
272 - Maybe it's time
I stop living the lie.\\
273 - Sinuses.\\
274 - All right, all right,
I was wrong, Bob.\\
275 - You need the toupee.
Put it back on.\\
276 - Hey, hey, Donna\\
277 - I want to sing to you\\
278 - Hey, hey, hey, Donna\\
279 - No one else will ever do\\
280 - I've waited so long\\
281 - For school to be through\\
282 - Donna, Donna, I love you\\
283 - Hey, hey, Donna\\
284 - Eric, get down off
there right now!\\
285 - What's the problem, Donna?\\
286 - Yeah, what's the problem, Donna?\\
287 - Timmy, go get your pants on,\\
288 - or I'll beat
the crap out of you.\\
289 - Eric, remember when
I told you to loosen up?\\
290 - Oh, yeah, baby.\\
291 - Well, tighten up, baby.\\
292 - When the house is on fire,
the party's over.\\
293 - Well, hey, this was your idea.\\
294 - Eric, I told you to loosen
up, not act like a dink.\\
295 - Well, I'm new at this.\\
296 - So sue me.\\
297 - Sue-hoo-hoo me\\
298 - Sue me, Donna\\
299 - Eric.\\
300 - Hello, Steven.\\
301 - Oh, I see how this is gonna be.\\
302 - So, when you're with
your little clique,\\
303 - you're too good for me.\\
304 - Right.\\
305 - But they're gone now, so hi.\\
306 - You know, for a rich girl,
you're kinda skanky.\\
307 - Come on, let me
show you the garage.\\
308 - That proves nothing.\\
309 - Son of a bitch.\\
310 - No. Listen, Jackie. Wait.
I owe you an apology.\\
311 - I just wanted to help tonight,
and I guess I blew it.\\
312 - And I'm sorry.\\
313 - Yeah. Lately, you've
been sorry a lot, Michael.\\
314 - Yeah, but this time I mean it.\\
315 - Actually, he does.\\
316 - He felt very bad and said
tender words about you,\\
317 - and then he set
your house on fire.\\
318 - See, he loves you,
but he just stupid.\\
319 - Thank you, Fez.\\
320 - Sure.\\
321 - Jackie, I do love you,\\
322 - and I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy with me.\\
323 - Yeah, well,
I'm beginning to think\\
324 - that you're never
gonna make me happy.\\
325 - What are you saying?\\
326 - I'm saying I have a lot
of thinking to do.\\
327 - Whew! Dodged a bullet there,
huh, Fez?\\
328 - Nothing good came
out of this night.\\
329 - Although I did find out
brandy's flammable.\\
330 - Yeah, it's worth knowing.\\
331 - Oh, and, uh, gasoline,
for future reference.\\
332 - I just don't get chicks, man.\\
333 - God, Donna, men are stupid.\\
334 - How can they not know
what we want?\\
335 - They want you to give them
what they want...\\
336 - I think they know
what we want.\\
337 - But you can't know
what they want\\
338 - They just won't give it to us.\\
339 - Because they never
tell you. You know?\\
340 - It's so simple.\\
341 - Yeah, it's confusing, huh?\\
342 - Oh, my God.
The most horrifying moment?\\
343 - Eric sang to me.\\
344 - Hey, I sang to Donna.\\
345 - Yeah, she kinda melted.\\
346 - I mean, she called me
a dink, but,\\
347 - I don't think she meant it.\\
348 - Eric was such a dink tonight.\\
349 - And I mean it.\\
350 - Totally.\\
351 - Totally.\\
352 - I told you, get out, crasher!\\
353 - I can't find my pants!
My mom's gonna kill me!\\
354 - Well, maybe you
should've thought about that\\
355 - before you took them off!\\
356 - Now, get out!\\
357 - Hey, so I hear you and
Kelso are kinda on the rocks.\\
358 - What do you say we go and...\\
359 - Ow!
\subsection {Episode 16: The First Time}
1 - Okay. Here we go.\\
2 - Right hand, blue.\\
3 - Fez, you can't play
Twister by yourself.\\
4 - That's where
you are wrong, my friend.\\
5 - Right leg, green.\\
6 - Oh, that's gonna be tough.\\
7 - Hey, Fez, man,
the circus called.\\
8 - They said they'll pay you
50 bucks a week\\
9 - if you can kiss your own ass.\\
10 - Take a message.\\
11 - I have the greatest news
in the world.\\
12 - How the hell are you doing that?\\
13 - I'm double-jointed.\\
14 - Super.\\
15 - My parents are renewing
their wedding vows.\\
16 - Wait, so double-dating
degenerates\\
17 - and skeezy bar hags
just lost its appeal?\\
18 - You'd be amazed how fast
skeezy bar hags lose their appeal.\\
19 - But then, like, two beers
later, it all comes roaring back.\\
20 - No. Finally,
the insanity's over.\\
21 - You know, I'm really
happy about this, Eric,\\
22 - and you should be, too.\\
23 - My parents have been
driving me nuts,\\
24 - and I've probably been
a little moody lately.\\
25 - No. God,
you haven't been moody.\\
26 - Oh, this is great.\\
27 - Jackie's gonna get
wedding fever.\\
28 - Man, all I'm gonna hear is,
"Michael, at our wedding,\\
29 - "don't shove cake in my face,"\\
30 - and, "You better know
how to dance,"\\
31 - and, "There will not
be a trampoline."\\
32 - A wedding
without a trampoline...\\
33 - That's crazy talk.\\
34 - Yeah. It'd be like a funeral
without a dunk tank.\\
35 - Yeah. You know what? She even knows
what kind of china patterns she wants.\\
36 - Pink and purple with unicorns.\\
37 - Who wants to see a unicorn
when they're eating pie?\\
38 - Left leg, yellow.\\
39 - Will someone please
help me get my pants off?\\
40 - No!\\
41 - Hanging out\\
42 - Down the street\\
43 - The same old thing\\
44 - We did last week\\
45 - Not a thing to do\\
46 - But talk to you\\
47 - We're all, all right\\
48 - We're all, all right\\
49 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
50 - Quit it.\\
51 - Are you sure you have to help
your parents with their wedding vows?\\
52 - Yes. Quit it.\\
53 - I got a vow.\\
54 - I vow...\\
55 - ...to kiss you so hard\\
56 - your pretty little
red head pops off.\\
57 - Yeah.\\
58 - No. I could
make that happen.\\
59 - Quit it.\\
60 - Donna, I'm sorry...\\
61 - But pinning me
only makes it sexier.\\
62 - Hey, kids.\\
63 - Hey, Donna, get off of me!\\
64 - Hello.\\
65 - Huh, so, what's up?\\
66 - Well, your mom and I
have been talking.\\
67 - We have a few ideas
about the vows.\\
68 - First of all, a wedding is a
nice way to spend the day.\\
69 - Write that down.\\
70 - "Spending the day with
your mom is nice."\\
71 - That's my first vow.\\
72 - I don't think that's a vow.\\
73 - Yes, it is.\\
74 - Okay, uh, Mom...\\
75 - Why do you want
to get remarried?\\
76 - Well, when your dad
and I were in the attic,\\
77 - we figured out I still
fit in my wedding dress.\\
78 - Oh, that's good, too.\\
79 - "Midge, you're as thin today\\
80 - "as the day
I married you."\\
81 - That's a nice vow.\\
82 - Write.\\
83 - So both the ceremony
and reception\\
84 - will be completely
green and gold...\\
85 - In honor of the Packers.\\
86 - That's... classy, Bob.\\
87 - And Red, since you and I
have a special bond,\\
88 - I'd like you to be my best man.\\
89 - Really?\\
90 - Yep.\\
91 - Well, I don't know, Bob.\\
92 - Oh, I think that is just lovely.\\
93 - Yeah. Fine. I'd love
to be your best man.\\
94 - And, Kitty,\\
95 - since you and Midge
are so close,\\
96 - she'd like to ask you
a special favor.\\
97 - Oh, Bob.\\
98 - I would be honored
to be Midge's...\\
99 - She'd like you to bring chairs.\\
100 - Chair-bringer.\\
101 - Oh, Steven,\\
102 - how'd you like to be our
wedding photographer?\\
103 - Nope. I like
to party at parties.\\
104 - I'll give you 10 bucks.\\
105 - 20 plus a meatball sub.\\
106 - - Deal.
- Deal.\\
107 - Well, got to go pick up
my green and gold tux.\\
108 - It's a special order.\\
109 - Guy looked at me
like I was an idiot.\\
110 - Yeah. That was the look.\\
111 - Well, can you beat that?\\
112 - Midge and I are much better
friends than you and Bob.\\
113 - Well, men's friendships are...\\
114 - All of my life I have
wanted to be a bridesmaid.\\
115 - None of my friends have ever
asked me to be a bridesmaid.\\
116 - Well, that's 'cause
you're too pretty.\\
117 - Oh, can it.
That's not gonna work.\\
118 - I am gonna be a bridesmaid.\\
119 - Hey, wanna be the best man?\\
120 - I'm sorry, man,
I must have lost your film.\\
121 - Are you sure it was this hut?\\
122 - Hey, man. All right.
Check this out, okay?\\
123 - Friend of mine's having
a wedding this weekend,\\
124 - and I told him that
I'd be the photographer.\\
125 - Cool, man.\\
126 - I remember my wedding.
It was magical, man.\\
127 - Chicks and booze everywhere.\\
128 - And I'd be willing to miss all that
chicky-boozy fun to take pictures, you know?\\
129 - But, Leo, man, I got a problem.\\
130 - I can't see
through the viewfinder\\
131 - because I have a glass eye.\\
132 - How come your eye
doesn't look like glass, man?\\
133 - Well, that's 'cause it's
special space-age glass.\\
134 - Whoa.
Your eye was in space?\\
135 - That's awesome, man.\\
136 - Okay.\\
137 - So, here's the deal, right?\\
138 - Job pays 10 bucks
and half a meatball sub.\\
139 - So I'm missing out on
a pretty sweet deal here.\\
140 - Damn you, glass eye.\\
141 - Well, hey, I could
use the 10 bucks, man,\\
142 - and half a meatball sub.\\
143 - If only I had a camera.\\
144 - Whoa!\\
145 - Hey, it's all
coming together, man.\\
146 - Why do we have to
get all dressed up\\
147 - for this stupid
rehearsal dinner?\\
148 - Because my mom said so.\\
149 - And we don't argue with mommy.\\
150 - Okay. So, Jackie
hasn't made me\\
151 - read a single bride's magazine.\\
152 - I'm telling you, man. Ever
since I set her house on fire,\\
153 - she's been acting really weird.\\
154 - Hey, you know, when I'm
trying to get in good with Donna,\\
155 - you know what works for me?\\
156 - I don't set her house
on fire. Yeah.\\
157 - Oh, sure.
Hindsight's 20/20.\\
158 - Here, loser, Mom
wants you to put this on.\\
159 - Hey, Laurie.\\
160 - Where have you been, you idiot?\\
161 - Oh, well, Jackie was...\\
162 - I told you never
to say that name to me.\\
163 - We have a relationship!\\
164 - - See, that's true, so...
- Shut up!\\
165 - Jackie, hear me now.\\
166 - I am not helping with
any of the wedding stuff.\\
167 - Good.\\
168 - Oh, nice try, Jackie,\\
169 - but the reverse psychology's
not gonna work on me.\\
170 - My mind's too powerful.\\
171 - - Whatever.
- Okay.\\
172 - Now, wait. Jackie,
that's confusing!\\
173 - I'm not chasing after you!\\
174 - Oh, Kitty, would you like
to meet the bridesmaids?\\
175 - Oh, Bob, would I like
to be a bridesmaid?\\
176 - No. Would you like
to meet the bridesmaids?\\
177 - Oh. Whatever. Fine.\\
178 - Uh, Kitty...\\
179 - This is Barbara,
Honor, and Holly.\\
180 - Hi.\\
181 - Holly's the maid of honor.\\
182 - Which is ironic that Honor
is not the maid of honor.\\
183 - - I am so gonna get you.
- Shut up!\\
184 - For God's sake,
don't do this now.\\
185 - You shut up!\\
186 - I didn't fly in
from Istanbul for this.\\
187 - Well, um, well, that is...
Is just a lovely dress.\\
188 - Where do the batteries go?\\
189 - Drink up!\\
190 - Okay, Red, you're the best man.\\
191 - You make the toast.\\
192 - I would, but I'm
not from Istanbul.\\
193 - Oh, fine.\\
194 - Excuse me. Ahem.\\
195 - Hello?\\
196 - Listen up, you bastards!\\
197 - I'm sorry about the,
uh, the bastards thing.\\
198 - Anyway, I'd like to
make a special toast\\
199 - to two very special
people, Bob and Midge.\\
200 - Aw.\\
201 - Bob and Midge.\\
202 - Bobby and Midgie.\\
203 - Here's to Bob and Midge!\\
204 - Aw.\\
205 - - Red, that was
a lovely toast.
- Well, thanks.\\
206 - Kitty, I have another
big favor to ask.\\
207 - Uh-huh.\\
208 - At the ceremony,
I'm wearing something old,\\
209 - something new,
something borrowed,\\
210 - and I wondered if you had
something blue I could borrow.\\
211 - No, but I have
something sharp and rusty\\
212 - I'd love to give you.\\
213 - No, thanks.\\
214 - Um...\\
215 - Dad, can I talk
to you for a second?\\
216 - I've been trying to work\\
217 - what we talked about
into your vows,\\
218 - but I'm having a little trouble.\\
219 - Did you put in that thing
about your mom staying thin?\\
220 - - Yeah.
- So what's the problem?\\
221 - Well, Dad, it just
doesn't seem very...\\
222 - Hey, there's nothing in there
about me being thin, is there?\\
223 - 'Cause I can't get
enough of these wienies.\\
224 - I can't believe this.\\
225 - Hey, good-lookin',
have a cocktail wienie?\\
226 - Leave me alone.\\
227 - What?
That's not a metaphor.\\
228 - Look, cocktail wienies.\\
229 - My God, can you believe it?\\
230 - I know, it's unbelievable.\\
231 - These are wedding vows,
Eric, vows.\\
232 - They're supposed
to mean something.\\
233 - Well, yeah.
That's what I said,\\
234 - and I was told to shut up.\\
235 - Shut up.
What is this?\\
236 - Scotch and soda.\\
237 - Uh, that's not Scotch.\\
238 - You're right.
It's a Shirley Temple.\\
239 - I just, I didn't wanna say that\\
240 - 'cause it sounded like something
Christy McNichol would drink, so...\\
241 - God.\\
242 - Their marriage almost ended.\\
243 - They put me through hell,\\
244 - and now that
they're getting back together,\\
245 - it's like it doesn't
even mean anything.\\
246 - How am I supposed
to write about love\\
247 - when they are the worst
example in the entire world?\\
248 - No, no. Okay, look, they
may not be the best example,\\
249 - but they do love each other.\\
250 - They just can't
express it, or...\\
251 - Really any thoughts more
complex than "I'm hungry."\\
252 - But the important thing is that
they really do love each other.\\
253 - Yeah. I guess they do.\\
254 - They do!
You know they do.\\
255 - And that's why they need
you to say what they can't say...\\
256 - Because, despite your bimbo-like
good looks, you're very smart.\\
257 - Look, write the vows
that you would write.\\
258 - And, Donna, I know...\\
259 - I know it'll be great.\\
260 - Okay.\\
261 - Thanks.\\
262 - Oh, hey, Fez, uh, if anybody
asks, this is a glass eye.\\
263 - What?\\
264 - Hey, Leo, man.
You all set?\\
265 - Totally, man.
I got everything.\\
266 - Great.
Where's the camera?\\
267 - I got everything
but the camera...\\
268 - Or the film or the flashcubes.\\
269 - I got nothing, man.\\
270 - Leo, man, the Fotohut
is loaded with that stuff.\\
271 - I know. It's ironic,
isn't it?\\
272 - And yet, not surprising.\\
273 - Hey, I'm Leo,\\
274 - and I'm also a Leo.\\
275 - Think about it.\\
276 - Yeah, wow. I'm Holly,
and I think that's deep.\\
277 - Boy, this wedding's
gonna be pretty lame\\
278 - without a trampoline, huh?\\
279 - Whatever.\\
280 - All right, Jackie.\\
281 - If you're mad at me, well,
then use your mad voice.\\
282 - And if you're not,
well, then, lady,\\
283 - you better start chewing
my ear off like usual.\\
284 - Look, Michael,
I'm not mad, okay?\\
285 - Could you be
any more annoying?\\
286 - Yes!\\
287 - Oh, Kitty, it's a disaster.\\
288 - The ceremony's starting,
and I can't find Holly.\\
289 - Well, I'm sure
she's here somewhere.\\
290 - I bet if we listen real hard,
we can hear her dress.\\
291 - All right, sweetie,
I'll help you look.\\
292 - Holly!\\
293 - Ooh!\\
294 - Have you ever
seen a girl do this before?\\
295 - Once in Amsterdam.\\
296 - I love photography, man.\\
297 - Oh, my.\\
298 - Midge?\\
299 - Sweetie, now, I just, um...\\
300 - I just, I don't have a
good feeling about this.\\
301 - - What am I gonna do?
- Well, you don't
worry about that.\\
302 - - You go back inside.
- Oh, thank you, Kitty.\\
303 - You're welcome.\\
304 - I win.\\
305 - Jackie, this is for you.\\
306 - Oh, my God.\\
307 - Pink and purple with a
unicorn. You remembered!\\
308 - Of course I remember.\\
309 - I remember everything you tell
me, even when you think I don't.\\
310 - Really?\\
311 - What's my favorite season?\\
312 - - Fall?
- Why?\\
313 - Uh, the outfits
flatter your chestnut eyes.\\
314 - And?\\
315 - Slimming lines and dark colors.\\
316 - Oh, my God, Michael!\\
317 - When you started acting
like an immature jerk,\\
318 - I started
having doubts about us,\\
319 - but now this purple and
pink unicorn candy dish\\
320 - proves you're
a grown-up. Oh!\\
321 - I'm a bridesmaid.\\
322 - First of all,\\
323 - Midge and I would like to
thank everyone for coming.\\
324 - It really means a lot to us.\\
325 - The vows we're exchanging\\
326 - were written by
our daughter Donna,\\
327 - whom we love very much.\\
328 - "Midgie, I consider it a
privilege to be your husband."\\
329 - Donna, I actually feel that way.\\
330 - "Bob, I'm proud and very
grateful to be your wife."\\
331 - "We've known each other
since we were practically kids...\\
332 - "So we know
all the good stuff...\\
333 - "And all the not-so-good
stuff about each other."\\
334 - "I can't imagine
feeling about anyone else\\
335 - "the way
I feel about you."\\
336 - "Because I love you.\\
337 - "I always loved you,\\
338 - "and I want
to make you a promise.\\
339 - "No matter
what happens...\\
340 - "Good or bad...\\
341 - "I will always love you."\\
342 - Oh!\\
343 - Okay. Donna, wait.\\
344 - What?\\
345 - Well, first you drag me
away from the wedding,\\
346 - and then you kiss me
all the way over here,\\
347 - and then you pull me upstairs
and shove me into my bedroom\\
348 - and put your hands
all over my body.\\
349 - I just...\\
350 - I'm sorry.
I'm confused.\\
351 - Huh. If only
there were a way\\
352 - to make my feelings clear
with some sort of action.\\
353 - Yeah. Ha. Okay.\\
354 - That's, uh, ahem,
ha-ha, extremely funny.\\
355 - But, uh, every, every time
this starts happening,\\
356 - it winds up not happening.\\
357 - And then you skip home...\\
358 - Tra-la-la-la-la.\\
359 - I know. I know,
and I'm sorry.\\
360 - It's just, you know,
before now, I wasn't ready.\\
361 - Yeah, and I
understand that, Donna.\\
362 - It's just that... wait!\\
363 - Wait! Go back!\\
364 - I wasn't ready before now.\\
365 - Before now, like...\\
366 - Right now?\\
367 - Eric, when I had
to write those vows,\\
368 - I had to think about love.\\
369 - When I thought about love,\\
370 - I thought about you.\\
371 - I love you, Eric,
and I want to be with you.\\
372 - God, Donna, I...\\
373 - Love you.\\
374 - Are you...\\
375 - Sure, sure?\\
376 - Yes, yes.
\subsection {Episode 17: Afterglow}
1 - So...\\
2 - This is what it's like
to not be a virgin.\\
3 - Yeah.\\
4 - So...\\
5 - - How are you?
- Good.\\
6 - How are you?\\
7 - - Good, good.
- Good.\\
8 - It was good.\\
9 - Right?\\
10 - I can honestly say
the best I've ever had.\\
11 - Was I good?\\
12 - Were you good?\\
13 - Donna, you know how
my mom's all over my back\\
14 - to write "thank you" notes,
and I never do?\\
15 - Well...\\
16 - Trust me. You're getting
a thank you note.\\
17 - Okay. We'd better
get back downstairs\\
18 - before people start
wondering where we are.\\
19 - Right. Oh...\\
20 - And we'll need
a cover story, so...\\
21 - Yeah. Let's just tell
everyone we had sex.\\
22 - No.\\
23 - Yeah, I know.
I'm kidding. Uh...\\
24 - We'll say we went out
for ice because...\\
25 - We needed to cool down
from having sex!\\
26 - Maybe I should do the talking.\\
27 - Yeah, well, you know,
try to work it in somewhere\\
28 - that we had sex, in
conversation, if it comes up.\\
29 - Great...\\
30 - Hanging out\\
31 - Down the street\\
32 - The same old thing\\
33 - We did last week\\
34 - Not a thing to do\\
35 - But talk to you\\
36 - We're all, all right\\
37 - We're all, all right\\
38 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
39 - You see, Fez,\\
40 - you take all the partially
consumed drinks\\
41 - and mix 'em together
into one, giant uber drink.\\
42 - In this case, Tom Wallbanger
bloody sunrise on the beach.\\
43 - Kelso, have you
been avoiding me?\\
44 - You kidding me?
I'm right here, aren't I?\\
45 - It's just that ever since I threatened
to tell Jackie about the two of us,\\
46 - you've seemed distant.\\
47 - Laurie, that's just
crazy, all right?\\
48 - You blackmailing me has
just brought us closer together.\\
49 - Hey there, kids.
Where have you two been?\\
50 - God, Dad, can't we
be gone for a minute\\
51 - without you making
all sorts of accusations?\\
52 - I mean, God,
it was just a minute.\\
53 - To be fair, Donna, it was
a little more than a minute.\\
54 - Donna, one of your drunken
uncles is touching me.\\
55 - Oh, my God.\\
56 - Oh, my God.\\
57 - We need to talk, right now!\\
58 - What?\\
59 - Yay! My first paycheck
from Pricemart!\\
60 - The dark times are over, Kitty.\\
61 - Oh, honey, those
weren't dark times.\\
62 - It was... an
economic segueway. Pfft!\\
63 - Well, it's over.
We should celebrate.\\
64 - Come on, Kitty,
let's get you pregnant.\\
65 - I'm kidding.\\
66 - You know I can barely
stand the kids we have.\\
67 - You know what we should do?\\
68 - Treat ourselves
to something nice.\\
69 - I know! We can
turn on the heat.\\
70 - All right...
Tell me everything.\\
71 - No.\\
72 - Come on, Donna. We're
supposed to be friends.\\
73 - Aren't we friends?\\
74 - Well, yeah.\\
75 - Okay then.\\
76 - So...\\
77 - What'd it look like?\\
78 - Jackie!\\
79 - Okay, we'll come back
to that one.\\
80 - So, how was it?\\
81 - Jackie, I don't really
want to talk about it.\\
82 - Oh...\\
83 - That bad, huh?\\
84 - No!\\
85 - No, no.
It was great.\\
86 - It just wasn't what I expected.\\
87 - I don't think we did it right.\\
88 - So Eric's not good?\\
89 - It was more like... Like
neither of us was good.\\
90 - Donna, it's not up
to the woman to be good.\\
91 - I don't know, Jackie. I mean, I love
Eric, but when the moment came,\\
92 - it was just, like...\\
93 - Awkward and weird...\\
94 - And...\\
95 - I don't know. I just felt
so far away, you know?\\
96 - No. But go on.\\
97 - I mean, during it, I just
remember thinking,\\
98 - "This is it.
This is what everyone..."\\
99 - Everyone what?\\
100 - That's as far as I got.\\
101 - Oh. See, that's the problem.\\
102 - That's not the problem.\\
103 - Oh, trust me.
That's a problem.\\
104 - Ok. You know what, Jackie?
Everything's fine.\\
105 - Just don't tell
anyone about this, okay?\\
106 - Okay.\\
107 - Okay?\\
108 - Okay!\\
109 - Eric and Donna had sex?\\
110 - Yeah, yeah.
And Eric wasn't good at it.\\
111 - Wow. Really?\\
112 - That's great!\\
113 - And I would've
gotten away with it, too,\\
114 - if it wasn't
for those darn kids!\\
115 - Oh...\\
116 - Oh, I love this Scooby-Doo!\\
117 - Forman, what the hell
you grinning about?\\
118 - What?\\
119 - A guy can't grin?\\
120 - I think that maybe...\\
121 - Forman and Donna finally
made the beast with two backs.\\
122 - The backosaurus?\\
123 - So?\\
124 - Well, Hyde, I'm not saying
yes, and I'm not saying no, but...\\
125 - I'm especially not saying no.\\
126 - Thank God.
Man, I'm telling you,\\
127 - I couldn't deal
with one more week\\
128 - of that "Will they,
won't they?" crap.\\
129 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
130 - What's goin' on?\\
131 - Donna made Forman a man.\\
132 - Okay. Yes, she did.\\
133 - Really?\\
134 - So...\\
135 - How was it?\\
136 - Well...\\
137 - Boys...\\
138 - I tell you, it was as if...\\
139 - In that one magic moment...\\
140 - The two people, Donna
and Eric, ceased to exist\\
141 - and were replaced instead
by one, perfect being.\\
142 - Donric Formciotti.\\
143 - So, Eric, you're saying
it was good?\\
144 - Kelso, was Michelangelo's
Creation of Adam good?\\
145 - Yes, Kelso, it was good!\\
146 - So, well, my first time...\\
147 - Jackie called me "The
Apollo rocket of love."\\
148 - What kind of rocket were you?\\
149 - Where you going
with this, Kelso?\\
150 - Nowhere.\\
151 - Except Jackie said you
were totally lame in the sack!\\
152 - - Jackie said?
- Yeah.\\
153 - Donna told Jackie.
Jackie told me.\\
154 - Oh, but you can't tell Jackie I
told you 'cause she'd get pissed.\\
155 - It's okay, Eric. Maybe
sex isn't your thing.\\
156 - All right.\\
157 - Almost there.\\
158 - Oh, I can't wait
to see what we got.\\
159 - Oh, you're gonna love it.\\
160 - - Are you ready?
- Uh-huh!\\
161 - Ta-da!\\
162 - A motorcycle?\\
163 - Don't you love it?\\
164 - Of course I do, Red.
What woman wouldn't?\\
165 - Oh, you hate it.\\
166 - Of course I do, Red.
What woman wouldn't?\\
167 - Red, I thought, I thought
we would get something\\
168 - we both would enjoy,
like a, a necklace.\\
169 - But this is much better
than a necklace.\\
170 - How?\\
171 - Well, it's...\\
172 - Not a stupid necklace.\\
173 - But it's shiny!\\
174 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
175 - Hmm.\\
176 - So...\\
177 - What's new?\\
178 - Well...\\
179 - Turns out I'm really
lame in the sack.\\
180 - What's new with you?\\
181 - - What?
- Oh, it's all the news.\\
182 - Jackie told Kelso,
and Kelso told all of us,\\
183 - so, sorry
I'm "Lame in the sack."\\
184 - I never said that. I said
it felt awkward and weird.\\
185 - Oh...\\
186 - What a relief.\\
187 - You could've told me.\\
188 - How am I supposed to
tell you something like that?\\
189 - I don't know. How about, "Hey,
Eric, you're awkward and weird"?\\
190 - You know what?
That's the problem.\\
191 - We did this really huge thing,\\
192 - and now I feel like I can't
even talk to you about it.\\
193 - Well, God knows,
you can talk to Jackie.\\
194 - I knew this was gonna happen.\\
195 - What?\\
196 - I knew that once we did this,
everything would change,\\
197 - and damned if it didn't.\\
198 - Well...\\
199 - If that's the way
you feel about it,\\
200 - maybe we should
never do it again.\\
201 - - Great.
- Oh... Great!\\
202 - Oh, great.\\
203 - Look, Kitty. Look
how good I look on it.\\
204 - Hey, we could get
matching jackets.\\
205 - You know how you love
things that match.\\
206 - Red, what were you thinking?\\
207 - Oh, come on, Kitty.\\
208 - You know the last thing
I bought for myself?\\
209 - A hose.\\
210 - Well, I'm sorry,
but we can't afford it.\\
211 - What do you mean?
I'm working again.\\
212 - But we still have
to get out of debt.\\
213 - And we have to pay
for Eric's college,\\
214 - and we got...
We got Laurie's wedding,\\
215 - and you know whoever
she ends up with,\\
216 - it's not gonna be
any Rockefeller.\\
217 - I suppose you're right.\\
218 - Well, at least,
let's take one ride on it...\\
219 - Before we bring it back.\\
220 - Okay, fine.\\
221 - Oh, that feels nice.\\
222 - Oh! That feels
very nice.\\
223 - - Michael, how could you?
- What'd I do?\\
224 - Michael, I didn't tell you
about Eric's sad dilemma\\
225 - so you could make fun of him.\\
226 - I told you
so you could help him.\\
227 - Jackie, I can't help him and
burn him at the same time.\\
228 - Uh, I mean, come
on, Jackie. It's funny!\\
229 - He must've been really bad.\\
230 - Yeah?
Well, so were you.\\
231 - Oh!\\
232 - All right, Jackie, I don't think you
know what you're saying, okay?\\
233 - 'Cause you called me
your Apollo rocket of love.\\
234 - Right...\\
235 - But I said it like...\\
236 - "Oh, Michael,\\
237 - "you're a regular
Apollo rocket of love."\\
238 - Okay, I don't hear a difference.\\
239 - Eric, if it makes
you feel any better,\\
240 - Michael was really bad
his first time, too.\\
241 - Oh!\\
242 - Um, that's supposed
to make me feel better?\\
243 - Doesn't it?\\
244 - Yeah, a little.
Thanks, Jackie.\\
245 - Forman, I've been thinking
about your problem with Donna,\\
246 - and after hours of
serious consideration...\\
247 - It still makes me laugh.\\
248 - Hey, you leave Eric alone!\\
249 - All right? He's our friend,
and he needs our help\\
250 - in this,
his most desperate hour.\\
251 - I'm with you, buddy.
Semper fi!\\
252 - Gee, Kelso, why the
sudden change of heart?\\
253 - Oh. Maybe it's because
the "Apollo rocket of love"\\
254 - blew up all over the launch pad?\\
255 - Ho-ho! A mystery.\\
256 - One suitable for Scooby-Doo
and his gang of cartoon teenagers.\\
257 - You know, guys, sometimes I
wish we were cartoon teenagers.\\
258 - Zoinks.
That'd be super, Fez.\\
259 - Look, man, if God
had meant for virgins\\
260 - to lose it to other virgins,\\
261 - he wouldn't have given us
middle-aged hookers, man!\\
262 - Amen, brother!\\
263 - Because if there's
one thing men like us know,\\
264 - it's how to have sex.\\
265 - Oh, I cannot live with this lie.\\
266 - Everyone, prepare to be shocked.\\
267 - I, Fez, am still a virgin.\\
268 - Gosh, my world
no longer makes sense.\\
269 - Fine, Hyde, but\\
270 - now that the middle-aged-hooker
ship has sailed,\\
271 - what am I supposed to do?\\
272 - Well, I know I got a lot better\\
273 - when I started making it
with your sister.\\
274 - I got it! You should
make it with my sister!\\
275 - Kelso, man,
I've seen your sister.\\
276 - She's a virgin,
and she's gonna be...\\
277 - For a long time.\\
278 - Hyde, what are you saying?\\
279 - Well, I think he's saying,
"Moo."\\
280 - Okay, maybe you did not hear me.\\
281 - Fez, the man you all revere,\\
282 - has still not had sex.\\
283 - Yeah. Heard you
the first time.\\
284 - Forman, you've gotta figure out
what you're doing wrong, man, and fast.\\
285 - You know what women call
guys who are lame in the sack?\\
286 - "Just friends."\\
287 - You can't let the pressure
get to you.\\
288 - Don't think about how
embarrassing it'd be\\
289 - if you tried and you couldn't,\\
290 - how she'd stare at you
with those cruel, black eyes,\\
291 - as if to say...\\
292 - "You're
not really a man, Michael.\\
293 - "You're not a man at all!"\\
294 - Okay.\\
295 - Well, this has been
really helpful, guys.\\
296 - All right, you called my bluff.\\
297 - I am not really
a virgin.\\
298 - Yes, I am.\\
299 - All right...
Fun's fun.\\
300 - - Time to
take it back.
- No.\\
301 - No?\\
302 - No. I like it.
I want to keep it.\\
303 - But you said yourself we
gotta save money for the kids.\\
304 - Oh, screw the damn kids.\\
305 - Oh, Red, I have worked
double shifts all year.\\
306 - I deserve this.
I want my hog.\\
307 - You know, Laurie might
not even get married.\\
308 - Maybe Eric will get
a scholarship to college.\\
309 - Well, hell, he might be too
stupid to even get in college!\\
310 - Well, Red, we can only hope.\\
311 - Ok, so just out
of curiosity, no reason,\\
312 - what was your first time like?\\
313 - Oh. My first time
was with a guy named...\\
314 - Your father.\\
315 - My first time was with
this guy named Darren.\\
316 - It was really special.\\
317 - Oh, no. Wait. It
wasn't Darren. It was...\\
318 - Robert?\\
319 - I think Robert.\\
320 - Well, um...\\
321 - Red and I waited until
after we were married.\\
322 - Like, five seconds after
we were married.\\
323 - We said, "To heck with
the receiving line,"\\
324 - and hit the nearest closet.\\
325 - Oh, I remember running my
hands through his long, blond hair,\\
326 - and listening to his
beautiful British accent.\\
327 - You see, because back then,\\
328 - your father was
blond and British.\\
329 - No, no, no.
Not Robert.\\
330 - There was this guy.
What was his name?\\
331 - Or was it his brother?\\
332 - It'll come to me.\\
333 - Good God, that dress must've had
a hundred buttons down the back,\\
334 - but Red got it off in no time.\\
335 - You wouldn't know it
to look at him,\\
336 - but Red's got
very nimble fingers.\\
337 - Nim-ble!\\
338 - I just remember it was
very disappointing,\\
339 - and I never saw that guy again.\\
340 - I mean, your father.\\
341 - I mean, your father
was the first.\\
342 - Don't tell your father, okay?\\
343 - I want to say Billy.\\
344 - But that's not right.\\
345 - Anyway, I just remember
that he wasn't very good.\\
346 - And it was just wonderful...\\
347 - Eventually.\\
348 - Okay, Donna...
Here's the deal.\\
349 - Do you have any Rolaids?\\
350 - I've been thinking
about what we said,\\
351 - about us not doing it again?\\
352 - And, uh, I've decided
that's just crazy talk.\\
353 - But, Eric, we did it, and
now everything's a mess.\\
354 - See, Donna...\\
355 - Everything you and I do
is a mess...\\
356 - At first.\\
357 - I mean, face it.\\
358 - We're just a couple
of goons here.\\
359 - The first time we kissed,\\
360 - the first time we went out.\\
361 - The first time I let
you get to second.\\
362 - Exactly.\\
363 - Wait. What did
I do wrong then?\\
364 - God, it was like
you were tuning a radio.\\
365 - Okay.\\
366 - Okay, but, do I still do that?\\
367 - No.\\
368 - And the kissing,
has that gotten better?\\
369 - Yeah, like,
a zillion times better.\\
370 - And, Donna, you know
why those things got better?\\
371 - Because we kinda care
about each other, and we talk...\\
372 - And we make things work.\\
373 - Yeah, but what if
it doesn't work?\\
374 - And then not only
does it not work,\\
375 - but we don't have
what we used to have?\\
376 - Donna, we will.
We love each other, right?\\
377 - So, trust me.\\
378 - It can only get better.\\
379 - Hmm.\\
380 - Okay, so, I guess what you're
saying is we need practice.\\
381 - And lots of it!
Yes!\\
382 - So?\\
383 - Yeah. It was
a little better.\\
384 - A little better?\\
385 - I am the king!\\
386 - Hey, Mom, any more
fried chicken?\\
387 - Well, my goodness,
you're a hungry little bee.\\
388 - Yeah, Forman.
Whatcha been doing?\\
389 - Exercising?\\
390 - In a manner of speaking.\\
391 - Hey, I'm too smart for you two
idiots to try innuendo with me.\\
392 - Got it?\\
393 - - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.\\
394 - You gonna eat that, big boy?
\subsection {Episode 18: Kitty and Eric's Night Out}
1 - Oh, man!
Where the hell is Eric?\\
2 - I gotta get outta here
before Jackie finds me.\\
3 - What'd you do now?\\
4 - Oh, she's mad\\
5 - 'cause I didn't say,
"Love you," after lunch.\\
6 - I say it all day long,
after gym, "Love you, Jackie".\\
7 - After algebra,
"Love you, Jackie".\\
8 - After I say, "Love you, Jackie,"\\
9 - I say, "Love you, Jackie."\\
10 - It sickens me!\\
11 - Hey, man, check it out.\\
12 - Foggy windows.\\
13 - Bummer.\\
14 - Someone must have left
their hot lunch in the car.\\
15 - No, you idiot. Someone's
in there makin' out, man.\\
16 - Patty!\\
17 - Hyde!
Hey, h-how you doin'?\\
18 - Super.\\
19 - Okay, well, I'll see ya.\\
20 - Hey, didn't you
go out with that girl?\\
21 - I don't think so.\\
22 - Yeah. That's the girl that
dogged you on that blind date.\\
23 - Kelso, who cares?\\
24 - Hey, let's see what loser
she ended up with.\\
25 - Yeah.\\
26 - Hello.\\
27 - Burn!\\
28 - Hey man, that's a burn.\\
29 - Hanging out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all, all right\\
36 - We're all, all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - Eric, honey,\\
39 - I was thinking
maybe tomorrow night\\
40 - we could go shopping,
just the two of us.\\
41 - Why?\\
42 - Well, because we need to get you\\
43 - some new shoes
and some underwear.\\
44 - Kitty, we bought him
shoes last year.\\
45 - Yeah, and I can shop
for my own underwear.\\
46 - Oh, no, you cannot.\\
47 - The last time you went,
you bought them too snug,\\
48 - and I want grandchildren.\\
49 - Yeah, well, I have to...\\
50 - Bye.\\
51 - You know, he used to love
going shopping with me.\\
52 - Look, Kitty, he's 16.\\
53 - Seventeen.\\
54 - Whatever.\\
55 - The point is that
when a boy hits that age,\\
56 - they don't wanna spend
time with their mother.\\
57 - And if they do...\\
58 - They're weird.\\
59 - It's not a big deal.\\
60 - Well, it is a big deal
to me, Red Forman.\\
61 - It is a big deal!\\
62 - Okay.\\
63 - Well, I just...
I just wish sometimes,\\
64 - he, he, he would want
to spend time with me.\\
65 - Well, force him!\\
66 - It doesn't matter what he wants.\\
67 - As long as
we're paying his way...\\
68 - We own him.\\
69 - - Fez has a girlfriend?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
70 - Our little Fez?\\
71 - You're kidding?\\
72 - I mean, good!\\
73 - God, he was so in love with me,\\
74 - it was getting embarrassing.\\
75 - Right.\\
76 - So, anyways, you guys,\\
77 - how do you know when
you need new underwear?\\
78 - Uh, hmm. If you're asking,
you need new underwear.\\
79 - Oh, good.
People are here.\\
80 - I want you to meet
my girlfriend Patty.\\
81 - This is Eric.
Eric, this is my...\\
82 - Girlfriend.\\
83 - This is Donna.\\
84 - Donna, this is my...\\
85 - Girlfriend.\\
86 - So you guys are just friends?\\
87 - - No, Donna.
- Fez, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.\\
88 - - So, how's it goin', Patty?
- Good.\\
89 - I have to be honest
with you, people,\\
90 - Patty and I were
just outside making out...\\
91 - Because Patty's my girlfriend.\\
92 - Hi, I'm Jackie.\\
93 - I'm sure Fez has
told you all about me.\\
94 - Um, no. No, your
name never came up.\\
95 - What?\\
96 - Well... Whatever.\\
97 - Okay, isn't this pleasant, huh?\\
98 - Um, Patty, have a seat.\\
99 - Fez, she's lovely.
I'm impressed.\\
100 - Um, Jackie, I'm a little
busy right now, okay?\\
101 - Thank you.\\
102 - So, Hyde, what's
with Fez and that girl?\\
103 - Did you really go out with her?\\
104 - Yeah, no biggie.\\
105 - She sucked, anyway.
He can have her.\\
106 - So Fez has a girlfriend?\\
107 - Still, I mean,
what's that about?\\
108 - Fez snaggin' a girl
away from you?\\
109 - I... never thought
I'd see the day.\\
110 - So what's she like?\\
111 - It's just so Twilight Zone,
I mean, to see Fez...\\
112 - Eric! Your mother asked you a
question about the foreign kid.\\
113 - What? Oh.\\
114 - - What?
- No. Never mind.\\
115 - Okay. That's it.\\
116 - Eric, you're gonna spend
some time with your mother.\\
117 - What'd I do?\\
118 - Red, don't make it
sound like a punishment.\\
119 - - Well, it is.
- Red!\\
120 - You can look
at it any way you want,\\
121 - but it's gonna happen, damn it.\\
122 - Wait, wait, is this...\\
123 - Because I didn't wanna
go shopping with Mom?\\
124 - You don't wanna go shopping
with your mom?\\
125 - Boy, I tell ya, if I had a Mom,\\
126 - I would go shopping
with her every single day,\\
127 - because no one loves you...\\
128 - ...like your mom.\\
129 - That's true.\\
130 - Eric, honey, we don't
have to go shopping.\\
131 - We could go see a movie.\\
132 - It'll be like a little date.\\
133 - No, no, no, no.
Shopping's great.\\
134 - You know, I, um, I need
new underwear, so...\\
135 - I think a date is a great idea.\\
136 - Hey, you guys should
go see Annie Hall,\\
137 - I think you'd just
love it, Mrs. Forman.\\
138 - See?
Steven's helping out.\\
139 - Thank you, Steven.\\
140 - Now, Annie Hall, I would
like to see that movie.\\
141 - Oh, Eric's just
dyin' to see that movie.\\
142 - - But I don't...
- Just dyin'.\\
143 - Um, I guess Fez really got me\\
144 - with all of the poems
that he left in my locker.\\
145 - Oh, that is so romantic.\\
146 - Well, doesn't Kelso
write you poems?\\
147 - No. No, but
he's not foreign.\\
148 - Hey, can we talk about
something interesting?\\
149 - Like, Donny Osmond?\\
150 - Hey, you guys,\\
151 - The Eagles are on Don
Kirshner's Rock Concert tonight.\\
152 - Oh, man, I'm gonna
miss The Eagles\\
153 - because I gotta, I gotta...\\
154 - I'm busy.\\
155 - Do we have a date tonight?\\
156 - No. I wish.\\
157 - I'm goin' to a movie.\\
158 - With my mom.\\
159 - He's got a special
night out with mommy.\\
160 - Hey, maybe you'll get lucky.\\
161 - And your mom'll
pay for the movie!\\
162 - God, you people are sick.\\
163 - Patty, you know, we should
really go to the mall together\\
164 - - so I can introduce you...
- Are you ready, darling?\\
165 - Excuse me, Fez.
I was talking.\\
166 - Oh, I know, Jackie.
You are always talking.\\
167 - - Oh!
- Burn!\\
168 - Sorry, I just appreciate
a good burn.\\
169 - So, where are you guys goin'?\\
170 - Um, we are going
to the Red Lobster\\
171 - for a romantic dinner
of Red Lobster.\\
172 - I'll see you guys later.\\
173 - Okay, I don't like her.\\
174 - And I don't see why we
have to be so nice to her\\
175 - just because she's dating
someone in our group.\\
176 - Bites the big one, doesn't it?\\
177 - Well, I gotta go to work.\\
178 - God, am I right, Donna?
Don't you hate her?\\
179 - Not really, Jackie.
I kinda like her.\\
180 - Hey, what was that for?\\
181 - That's for not
writing me poems, Michael!\\
182 - Uh, love you, Jackie.\\
183 - Leo, did you take
your turn yet, man?\\
184 - No, man.\\
185 - I, I can't decide between
college or a career.\\
186 - Well, we can't start
until you decide.\\
187 - So choose, man,
or I'll start workin'.\\
188 - Hey, don't rush me, man.\\
189 - This decision's gonna
affect the rest of my life.\\
190 - Go to college.\\
191 - Okay.\\
192 - Hey, but...\\
193 - What if those frat guys
make fun of my hair?\\
194 - And beat me up like,
like fascists and stuff?\\
195 - Well, then just start a career.\\
196 - I can't let those frat guys
get away with it, man.\\
197 - Leo, man, it's just a game!\\
198 - Yeah. Life is hard.\\
199 - Well, now, see, I didn't know\\
200 - that you liked green peppers.\\
201 - When did that happen?\\
202 - August 5, 1972.\\
203 - I mean...\\
204 - I mean, do you like
green peppers?\\
205 - Why, yes I do.\\
206 - Very much.\\
207 - So how's Donna?\\
208 - What? We haven't
done anything yet. What?\\
209 - Relax.\\
210 - I am not here to grill
you about your life, Eric.\\
211 - But, you know, young adults
do have a responsibility.\\
212 - Mom!\\
213 - Please.\\
214 - Honey, you may not
realize it right now,\\
215 - but I am actually
doing you a giant favor\\
216 - by making you
spend time with me.\\
217 - Well, thank you.\\
218 - No, no, no.
I mean it.\\
219 - Boys who reject their mothers\\
220 - grow up to have huge problems.\\
221 - You will hate yourself.\\
222 - And every relationship you have
with a woman will just be a mess.\\
223 - So, if you don't
spend time with me now,\\
224 - you may never have sex.\\
225 - I'm teasing!\\
226 - A little.\\
227 - Ah-ha. Hey...\\
228 - Look how far Florence
is from... Venice.\\
229 - Eric...\\
230 - Honey, I just...\\
231 - I just wanted to spend a
little time alone with you\\
232 - outside of the house.
That's all.\\
233 - Mom, it's fine.\\
234 - And, in fact, you know
what? This is great.\\
235 - Hey, Forman's out on
a date with his mom!\\
236 - Forman and his mom!\\
237 - Forman and his mom!\\
238 - Forman and his mom!\\
239 - My goodness,
that Woody Allen is neurotic.\\
240 - Well, if I lived in New York,
I'd be in therapy, too.\\
241 - The streets are filthy.\\
242 - Whoa!
Diane Keaton is not wearing a bra.\\
243 - Okay, don't let your mom
see you look.\\
244 - But I have to look.\\
245 - I'm lookin'.\\
246 - I'm lookin', and I don't care!\\
247 - Oh, please.\\
248 - He expects her to make love\\
249 - while he's wearing
those black socks?\\
250 - Note to
self, throw away all black socks.\\
251 - Mah-jongg?\\
252 - What the hell is mah-jongg?\\
253 - Mah-jongg?\\
254 - What the hell is mah-jongg?\\
255 - Okay.
"An aspirin the size of a brick."\\
256 - Now, that is funny.\\
257 - Finally,
a scene without sex.\\
258 - Oh, great. Drugs.\\
259 - Thank you, Woody Allen.\\
260 - Huh.
I guess cocaine is expensive.\\
261 - "I'm finally
getting the feeling back in my jaw?"\\
262 - I don't get that.
I mean, he was just\\
263 - in bed with her
and... Oh! Okay.\\
264 - I see.\\
265 - Oh, God. I hope my mom
doesn't get that.\\
266 - Ooh.
I wonder if Eric gets that.\\
267 - Well, I am not
gonna explain it to him.\\
268 - So now Patty's seein' Fez,
and I just don't get it.\\
269 - 'Cause she could've had me.\\
270 - I'm a real catch, man.\\
271 - All right!
I had twins, man!\\
272 - Oh, look.
They're so beautiful!\\
273 - Congratulations.\\
274 - Thanks, man.\\
275 - Hey, I don't wanna be
competitive or anything, man,\\
276 - but, uh, I've got two kids,
and you don't have any.\\
277 - You're just a lonely
plumber, dude.\\
278 - It wouldn't be so bad,\\
279 - but it's Fez.\\
280 - I taught him
everything he knows.\\
281 - It's all backwards, man.\\
282 - I guess you just can't
dwell on things, man.\\
283 - Yeah.\\
284 - Maybe I should
just be happy for Fez.\\
285 - I mean, this is the first
time in his whole life\\
286 - that he's ever
had a girl, you know.\\
287 - Now, you know, a while
back, I picked up a card\\
288 - that, you know,
and I had a car accident...\\
289 - And, uh, I was
dwelling on that, man.\\
290 - I'm sorry, what were
you talkin' about?\\
291 - Maybe I should get back to work.\\
292 - If you get back to
work, you're fired, man.\\
293 - Hey, I got twins again, man!\\
294 - Just admit it, Donna.\\
295 - Patty is totally wrong for Fez.\\
296 - Well, Jackie,
we've never seen you\\
297 - quite this transparent before.\\
298 - What are you talking about?\\
299 - "She's so awful, Donna!"\\
300 - "Let's hate her
forever, Donna!"\\
301 - "Let's shave her head and
run her out of town, Donna!"\\
302 - Focus, Donna!\\
303 - We're ragging on Patty,
remember?\\
304 - Jackie, did you ever
think that maybe\\
305 - you hate Patty
because you like Fez?\\
306 - Oh, you are in dangerous
territory, Pinciotti.\\
307 - No, I mean, it's true.\\
308 - You hate seeing Fez drool
over someone other than you.\\
309 - You're crazy.
I don't like Fez.\\
310 - I think you do.\\
311 - Oh, shut up.\\
312 - Jackie, you're blushing!\\
313 - Ow!\\
314 - I'll admit that, uh...\\
315 - Fez would be okay
for a quick fling\\
316 - if I was off on a
vacation with my parents,\\
317 - like in Michigan or Cuba.\\
318 - Where no one
would ever find out!\\
319 - Ever, ever, ever!\\
320 - Fez and Jackie,
sittin' in a tree.\\
321 - Mr. And Mrs. Fez...\\
322 - Fez.\\
323 - Donna, please, please shut up.\\
324 - Jackie, you are so totally
hot for him.\\
325 - I can see it in your eyes.\\
326 - Oh, my God.\\
327 - Oh, my God!\\
328 - I like Fez!\\
329 - No!\\
330 - No!\\
331 - Well, boy, wasn't that fun, seeing all
those sex scenes with your mother?\\
332 - Oh, it was supersexy.\\
333 - I'm so glad we could enjoy
that together. Really, I am.\\
334 - So, I guess women in
New York don't wear bras.\\
335 - Um, it's disgusting...\\
336 - And we should
move there immediately.\\
337 - Well, I don't know about you,\\
338 - but I've seen enough
nipples for one day.\\
339 - Mom.\\
340 - What?\\
341 - I don't ever want to hear
you say, "Nipples," okay?\\
342 - Why not?
Men have nipples.\\
343 - Your father has nipples.\\
344 - No! He does not!\\
345 - Okay.\\
346 - So, what was your
favorite part of the movie?\\
347 - Eh, I don't want to tell you.\\
348 - Oh, come on.\\
349 - Okay, um...\\
350 - Diane Keaton's nipples.\\
351 - Okay. Pay me.\\
352 - Leo, I gotta help
the customer, man.\\
353 - I think
he's gonna drive away.\\
354 - Eh, let him go. I don't need
his stinkin' photo money.\\
355 - I'm a doctor.\\
356 - Okay, man, you
know what? That's it.\\
357 - This game is over, man.\\
358 - This is not life.
This is life!\\
359 - Yeah, but this life is so
much better than this life, man.\\
360 - In the, in the game,
I got kids, man.\\
361 - In real life,
my kids split on me.\\
362 - - Really, man?
- Yeah.\\
363 - My parents split on me.\\
364 - Oh, wow.
Now we found each other.\\
365 - Hey, do you wanna be my father?\\
366 - Sure.\\
367 - Okay. Go ahead.
Spin, Dad.\\
368 - I got a 10.\\
369 - Well, maybe mah-jongg
is a type of food.\\
370 - Oh, you know what?
You could be right.\\
371 - It's probably Chinese noodles.\\
372 - Yes.\\
373 - Hey, you wanna go see
Close Encounters sometime?\\
374 - Yeah. I'd love to.\\
375 - Very cool.
Good night, Mom.\\
376 - Oh, what did he do?\\
377 - I swear I'll kick his ass!\\
378 - No. He was just,
he was absolutely wonderful.\\
379 - Oh.\\
380 - Okay.\\
381 - Okay.\\
382 - Is something wrong?\\
383 - No. Why?\\
384 - I don't know. It's just you,
you seem very removed.\\
385 - Well, no. I'm fine.\\
386 - Are you sure?\\
387 - Uh-huh.\\
388 - I, you know, maybe
it's me, but you do,\\
389 - you seem very removed.\\
390 - Eric, have you seen
my geometry book?\\
391 - 'Cause while the two
of you are doing that,\\
392 - I think I'm gonna
do some homework.\\
393 - See? This is what
I call being removed.\\
394 - Donna, when we're making out,
you're not thinking about, like...\\
395 - Geometry and stuff, are you?\\
396 - Never.\\
397 - Unless I have
a test the next day.\\
398 - Okay.\\
399 - You know, I think you're just
the sweetest thing in the world\\
400 - to go out with your mom.\\
401 - Thank you.\\
402 - So, did mommy
buy you new underpants?\\
403 - Okay.\\
404 - Did mommy buy you
new underpants?\\
405 - Ooh, let me see the underpants.\\
406 - - Get off me.
- Let me see. Let me see.\\
407 - B-3.\\
408 - Hit. Damn!
You sank my battleship!\\
409 - You know,
a well-maintained fleet\\
410 - is the backbone of
any military structure,\\
411 - and with your floating
arsenal depleted,\\
412 - your troops are likely to suffer
some serious collateral damage.\\
413 - Huh.\\
414 - Wow. Hey,
you know what, man?\\
415 - I think I might have
been in the navy.
\subsection {Episode 19: Parents Find Out}
1 - Eric!\\
2 - Eric!\\
3 - Donna, this is a
tricky maneuver, okay?\\
4 - I need quiet.\\
5 - Oh, my God!
It's the cops!\\
6 - Eric!\\
7 - We're completely naked!\\
8 - Uh...\\
9 - Don't panic.\\
10 - I, uh... I have a plan. Okay.\\
11 - Go away!\\
12 - That's the plan?
That's not a good plan!\\
13 - Yeah! No,
that's the plan.\\
14 - I mean, we're totally naked.\\
15 - I think he'll probably
just go away.\\
16 - Crap. Have you seen
my pants?\\
17 - Where you going?\\
18 - Out.\\
19 - Where?\\
20 - A place.\\
21 - Who with?\\
22 - Doctors and stockbrokers.\\
23 - Oh, holy hell!\\
24 - Hanging out\\
25 - Down the street\\
26 - The same old thing\\
27 - We did last week\\
28 - Not a thing to do\\
29 - But talk to you\\
30 - We're all, all right\\
31 - We're all, all right\\
32 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
33 - And, and... And the heater
is broken in the Vista Cruiser.\\
34 - That's why it was
so hot. So, uh...\\
35 - You know, naturally we removed
one or two articles of clothing,\\
36 - which, you know, in retrospect
was probably not that good an idea.\\
37 - Eric...\\
38 - How stupid do you think I am?\\
39 - You're right.\\
40 - Should have cracked a
window. Good thinking.\\
41 - Eric, we know
what you were doing\\
42 - in the car!\\
43 - No.\\
44 - We don't know.\\
45 - Trust me. We know.\\
46 - No. No.
We don't know.\\
47 - I know! I know!\\
48 - Of course you know.
You majored in it.\\
49 - What were you thinking?\\
50 - Mr. Forman? Uh...\\
51 - It was my idea, too,\\
52 - so, um...\\
53 - Please stop yelling
at Eric. Because...\\
54 - What?\\
55 - Just play dead
and cover your face.\\
56 - No, Eric. It's okay.\\
57 - What we did was a choice\\
58 - that we made...\\
59 - A choice we made\\
60 - as adults.\\
61 - Oh, really?\\
62 - You're an adult?\\
63 - Don't answer.
It's a trap!\\
64 - Yes. We're adults.\\
65 - Okay, Donna.\\
66 - Then as an adult, I expect you\\
67 - to go next door
and tell Bob and Midge\\
68 - just exactly
what happened tonight.\\
69 - Okay.\\
70 - I'll tell them.\\
71 - Good! And I'm gonna
check to see that you did.\\
72 - Oh, come on! Why
would you do that?\\
73 - Donna, I won't keep something
like this from your parents.\\
74 - They think we're friends.\\
75 - Hey, cool, man.
A CB radio!\\
76 - Yeah!
So I narrowed down\\
77 - my potential CB
handles to two choices.\\
78 - Either "Stud Kickass"
or "Flex Buffchest."\\
79 - Gee, Kelso. What about
"Beef Dingleberry"?\\
80 - Oh, great.
Now I got three choices.\\
81 - Breaker, 1-9, breaker, 1-9.\\
82 - This is Hot To Trot.\\
83 - Foxy Lady.\\
84 - And Nice And Easy.\\
85 - Oh, my God.
They sound nice!\\
86 - And easy.\\
87 - Quick! Come on,
we need handles\\
88 - so we can talk to 'em!\\
89 - Okay, uh... Oh! Oh!
We'll be The Mod Squad.\\
90 - That's perfect!
I'm Linc.\\
91 - I'm Linc.\\
92 - Why do you get to be Linc?\\
93 - The magic fr-ro, baby!\\
94 - Okay.\\
95 - Well, I got dibs on Pete.\\
96 - Okay, then, what is
my macho cop handle?\\
97 - Julie.
Julie.\\
98 - Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9.\\
99 - This is Pete.\\
100 - I'm Linc.\\
101 - And Julie.\\
102 - It is so nice to talk
to you, my lovelies.\\
103 - Hey, Julie.\\
104 - Cool accent.
You sound sexy.\\
105 - Accent? What the hell
is she talking about?\\
106 - Something on your mind?
Yeah.\\
107 - There's something important
I wanna tell you guys.\\
108 - Eric and I have been going
out for a while now, and\\
109 - we did something
you two should know about.\\
110 - Yes?\\
111 - Well, see, Eric and I...\\
112 - Uh, we, um...\\
113 - We...\\
114 - Rode the Forman's motorcycle!\\
115 - Whew! There!
I said it!\\
116 - Weight is just off my shoulders!\\
117 - Donna, that was wrong.\\
118 - But not as wrong as it could have
been, 'cause it could have been...\\
119 - Sex!\\
120 - That's what I thought, too!\\
121 - What?\\
122 - No, that's crazy!\\
123 - That's, that's silly!\\
124 - You guys are silly gooses!\\
125 - You make me laugh...\\
126 - 'Cause you're silly!\\
127 - So the cops caught you doing it?\\
128 - Oh, my God.\\
129 - That is such a turn-on!\\
130 - That is not a turn-on!\\
131 - You're a little pervert!\\
132 - Jackie, I have a big problem.\\
133 - How am I gonna tell my parents?\\
134 - Okay.\\
135 - If you need to use the
bathroom, you should go now.\\
136 - 'Cause I have a lot to say.\\
137 - No. I'm fine. Thanks.\\
138 - Okay. Your first
mistake...\\
139 - Was wearing pants for car sex.\\
140 - When you do it in the car,\\
141 - skirts are your best friend.\\
142 - Zip, zip, bim, bam,\\
143 - you're done, you're dressed,
you're back at the mall.\\
144 - Jackie, I'm screwed.\\
145 - If I tell my parents, only
one of two things can happen.\\
146 - They'll either be furious...\\
147 - Or they'll ask me how it was.\\
148 - Okay, now...\\
149 - Have some peas!\\
150 - I'd rather have sex\\
151 - with Donna.\\
152 - Mmm!\\
153 - Tapioca!\\
154 - Mmm!\\
155 - Sex with Donna!\\
156 - Well, you...\\
157 - You are just so cute.\\
158 - Say ma-ma.\\
159 - Sex with Don-na.\\
160 - No, baby, no.\\
161 - Yes!\\
162 - No!
Yes!\\
163 - No!
No. Yes!\\
164 - No!\\
165 - No!\\
166 - No!\\
167 - Kitty!\\
168 - Slut!\\
169 - What?\\
170 - Nothing.\\
171 - Are you okay?\\
172 - I'm fine.\\
173 - Kitty, when it's three o'clock
on a Saturday afternoon\\
174 - and you're still in bed,
I know something's wrong.\\
175 - Oh, Red, I'm fine.\\
176 - Why should I care that my...\\
177 - My sweet baby boy was...\\
178 - Defiled by some
jiggly, red-haired tramp?\\
179 - Kitty...\\
180 - What I can't figure out\\
181 - is how she tricked him into it!\\
182 - Look, it's not like we didn't
know this was coming.\\
183 - You're always showing Eric
anatomical diagrams\\
184 - and charts and slides.\\
185 - You been preppin' him
since he was six!\\
186 - Are you blaming me?\\
187 - No, no.\\
188 - Heck no!\\
189 - It's my fault.\\
190 - Men are dirty. It's...\\
191 - Well, good.\\
192 - Kitty, I just want you
to get out of bed.\\
193 - You know, none of us
have had lunch, and, uh...\\
194 - We're kinda hungry.\\
195 - Well, it's a house
full of grown men,\\
196 - and I would think that
one of you fully grown men\\
197 - would know how to
make a damn sandwich!\\
198 - Well, maybe I should
go... I sure as hell would!\\
199 - And when Bob and Midge look
at me with their big, dumb eyes,\\
200 - I just...\\
201 - I can't find the words.\\
202 - Okay, Donna. I've
given this a lot of thought,\\
203 - and I think I should be the one
to tell your parents we had sex.\\
204 - Oh, my God.\\
205 - Eric, that is so great!
Thank you!\\
206 - What? No.
No! What? No!\\
207 - It was a bluff! I was
bluffing to seem nice.\\
208 - Oh, crap, this is a nightmare.\\
209 - Fine. I'll do it
myself.\\
210 - What? No, wait. Look.\\
211 - We told my parents
together, so...\\
212 - Hey, let's tell
your parents together.\\
213 - Thank you!\\
214 - So do you wanna
go get it over with?\\
215 - Yeah. Let's go tell
your parents. Okay!\\
216 - Okay.\\
217 - Donna, I wanna go
with you, but...\\
218 - My
legs have gone numb.\\
219 - Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9.\\
220 - This is Pete, Linc, and Julie.\\
221 - We're lookin' for
a 20 on Hot To Trot,\\
222 - Foxy Lady, and
Nice And Easy. Over.\\
223 - Hey, guys.\\
224 - Hello, Hot To Trot.\\
225 - This is Julie.\\
226 - I was just wondering...\\
227 - Are you fat?\\
228 - Whoa, Fez!\\
229 - No actually, that's
not a bad question.\\
230 - Well, why don't
you guys come see for yourselves?\\
231 - We can meet tonight.\\
232 - Oh, tonight?\\
233 - No, tonight we have
to watch Love Boat, so...\\
234 - As soon as I heard you
were down, Mrs. Forman,\\
235 - I had to come and see you.\\
236 - Because I know the blues.\\
237 - But you know, the good
news is Donna's on the pill.\\
238 - So...\\
239 - They can do it, like,
a zillion times a day,\\
240 - and nothing bad can happen!\\
241 - Yeah. They
can just do it and do it and do it\\
242 - and do it and do it.\\
243 - Jackie!\\
244 - Good. You're here.\\
245 - Get out.\\
246 - But I'm trying to help.\\
247 - Oh, you wanna help?\\
248 - Go make me a sandwich.\\
249 - So, Kitty...\\
250 - You think maybe, uh,
it's time to get up?\\
251 - No.\\
252 - Okay.
You know what?\\
253 - Kitty, you gotta shape up!\\
254 - I can't believe that
you're all surprised\\
255 - that your 17-year-old\\
256 - is doing what 17-year-olds do!\\
257 - Big deal!\\
258 - Now get the hell
outta bed and buck up!\\
259 - Oh, jeez, honey, I'm sorry.\\
260 - Get out!\\
261 - So, what do you kids
need to tell us?\\
262 - I tried to guess, but
my mind's a total blank.\\
263 - Actually... Mrs.
Pinciotti, Mr. Pinciotti,\\
264 - it's something
I need to tell you.\\
265 - Sorry.
I almost threw up.\\
266 - I'm fine now.\\
267 - You both know how much\\
268 - I respect your daughter.\\
269 - How much I love your daughter,\\
270 - and, uh...\\
271 - Funny thing about
love, ha-ha... Funny...\\
272 - Is, uh, sometimes\\
273 - we express it in a...
In a physical way.\\
274 - You better not say what
I think you're gonna say.\\
275 - 'Cause I'll be mad.\\
276 - And funny thing about mad...\\
277 - Ha-ha...\\
278 - Is sometimes I express
it in a physical way.\\
279 - I love your daughter.
And...\\
280 - I totally respect her,\\
281 - and I never stopped
respecting her.\\
282 - Even when the cops came.\\
283 - Well, I'm sorry, Eric, but I
still gotta twist your neck shut.\\
284 - Dad, you know, you
shouldn't be threatening Eric.\\
285 - You should be, uh...
Thanking him.\\
286 - What?
What?\\
287 - Wow!\\
288 - He's treated me like a queen\\
289 - since the day we started dating.\\
290 - Eric and I have sex.\\
291 - There. You know.\\
292 - At least I have a nice boyfriend\\
293 - and not some
juvenile delinquent.\\
294 - Like that Fonzie!\\
295 - Well, that...\\
296 - That's nice.\\
297 - And at least Eric had
the guts to come over here\\
298 - and tell you man-to-man.\\
299 - Well...\\
300 - I'm happy for you.\\
301 - And thank you for being honest.\\
302 - That took a lot of
courage, didn't it, Bob?\\
303 - I'm goin' to bed.\\
304 - So...\\
305 - How was it?\\
306 - Oh, God!\\
307 - Boy, oh, boy.\\
308 - I tell ya, Eric.\\
309 - You take the cake!\\
310 - Aw, man, there's cake?\\
311 - There's no cake.\\
312 - We're all starving to
death, and it's all your fault.\\
313 - You broke your mother's heart!\\
314 - She's up there crying\\
315 - about how you're all grown up\\
316 - and you don't need her anymore.\\
317 - Well, that...\\
318 - That's not true.\\
319 - I know that.\\
320 - You're a helpless idiot!\\
321 - Huh. Okay.\\
322 - I... I could pretend to need
help with my homework.\\
323 - Oh, no. No one gives
a crap about that.\\
324 - Okay. Oh! I could
pretend to be sick!\\
325 - Oh, that...\\
326 - Wait a minute.
That might work.\\
327 - She mothered the heck outta you
when you broke your leg that time.\\
328 - Right. I could say
I have a fever.\\
329 - Or better yet, we could
go out to the garage,\\
330 - I hit you in the elbow
with a baseball bat.\\
331 - I'm gonna stick with the fever.\\
332 - You wanna go through life
doing everything half-assed,\\
333 - that's your decision, son.\\
334 - Okay!\\
335 - They said they'd wait out front.\\
336 - Here we go! Cold
beer and hot babes!\\
337 - Or vice versa.\\
338 - Hey, guys,\\
339 - did we get a yes or a
no on the fat question?\\
340 - Oh, goody. They're
not fat. They're just old.\\
341 - If your voice is hot,\\
342 - then you should be hot!\\
343 - Those are the rules!\\
344 - Damn old ladies with hot voices.\\
345 - Let's go.\\
346 - No, no, no. I'm staying.
You two are shallow.\\
347 - I'm not shallow, Fez.\\
348 - I just judge chicks
on their looks.\\
349 - Suit yourself. But
sometimes the old ones\\
350 - are super grateful.\\
351 - Yeah. Okay, Fez,\\
352 - but if you wind up in some
car feelin' up June Cleaver,\\
353 - don't come crying to me! Yeah!\\
354 - Hello, my lovelies.\\
355 - I am Julie.\\
356 - Which one of you is Hot To Trot?\\
357 - Julie?
Yes?\\
358 - Hey! You made it!
I'm Hot To Trot.\\
359 - I'm Foxy Lady.\\
360 - And I'm Nice And Easy.\\
361 - You're not fat.\\
362 - Or old at all!\\
363 - Of course not.
We're gymnasts.\\
364 - Dear Penthouse...\\
365 - I'm really sick.\\
366 - Mommy.\\
367 - And I don't have anyone
to take care of me.\\
368 - Well, you do feel a little warm.\\
369 - Right.
'Cause I'm sick.\\
370 - Or you stuck a hot
towel on your head, Eric.\\
371 - Fine. I'm not sick.
I just...\\
372 - I didn't want you
to be mad anymore, Mom.\\
373 - Oh, honey, I'm not mad.\\
374 - I'm just...\\
375 - Horribly, horribly depressed.\\
376 - Look...\\
377 - Mom, I'm not all grown up,
and I do still need you for stuff.\\
378 - Oh, you do not.\\
379 - Sure I do.\\
380 - Really? For what?
List it.\\
381 - I need you to love me.\\
382 - I need you to...\\
383 - I really need you
to get out of bed,\\
384 - because dad's been making
my life extra miserable!\\
385 - Well, okay, that one I buy.\\
386 - So, are we okay now?\\
387 - Oh, honey...\\
388 - No!\\
389 - Well, I'm sorry. I Just... I
don't like you growing up.\\
390 - And I don't like it,
and I'm not gonna.\\
391 - But I...\\
392 - I guess it's just something
I'm gonna have to get used to.\\
393 - You know what, Mom?\\
394 - I'm always gonna need you.\\
395 - Because chances are...\\
396 - Dad's gonna be riding my
ass for the rest of my life!\\
397 - Yeah.\\
398 - You really do rub him
the wrong way, honey.\\
399 - How you doin'?\\
400 - That's a really nice robe.\\
401 - Uh, is that real velour?\\
402 - Hey, those gas prices
are, like, argh, right?\\
403 - It's a shame about Elvis.\\
404 - Too soon.\\
405 - So... young.
\subsection {Episode 20: Kiss of Death}
1 - Hey, Mr. Bonkers.\\
2 - You nutty kitty.\\
3 - I'll be right home.
Keep my bed warm, okay?\\
4 - Hey. Keep your paws
to yourself.\\
5 - She's my girlfriend.\\
6 - So, what was
your favorite part of the movie?\\
7 - Uh, my favorite part of the
movie was when we made out.\\
8 - Yeah.
Movies are fun.\\
9 - Yeah.\\
10 - Goodnight.\\
11 - You know, it's amazing
how you always manage\\
12 - to pull the car
right up to the garage,\\
13 - but not actually into it.\\
14 - Yup. Takes a keen eye
and a sure foot.\\
15 - How would you like your keen eye\\
16 - to watch my sure foot
kick your smart ass?\\
17 - Why don't I pull the car in?\\
18 - What the...\\
19 - You're movin' it a foot,\\
20 - and you hit somethin'.\\
21 - Jeez.\\
22 - Oh, God. No! It's...\\
23 - It's Mr. Bonkers.\\
24 - Wow. That is one dead cat.\\
25 - Hanging out\\
26 - Down the street\\
27 - The same old thing\\
28 - We did last week\\
29 - Not a thing to do\\
30 - But talk to you\\
31 - We're all, all right\\
32 - We're all, all right\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - If I was stranded
on a desert island\\
35 - with only one form of cheese,\\
36 - no question, it would
have to be the puff.\\
37 - You know who's
my little cheese puff?\\
38 - Jackie.\\
39 - Oh, Michael, you're so cute.\\
40 - You're cute.
Cuter.\\
41 - Cutest.\\
42 - All right. All right.
You guys gotta shut up\\
43 - before I blow
cheese puff chunks.\\
44 - All right, Michael,\\
45 - I'll see you tonight
at 8:00. Okay.\\
46 - I'll be counting the minutes.\\
47 - Can't you just use a clock?\\
48 - Man, we're so back in love.\\
49 - I remember when it was all,\\
50 - "You're an idiot, Michael!"\\
51 - And, "Whoa, what'd I do?"\\
52 - Good times.\\
53 - Sorry, man, but I love her.\\
54 - Yes, but you don't deserve
her, you son of a bitch.\\
55 - What?\\
56 - I said...\\
57 - Uh, "Good cheese puffs,
you son of a bitch."\\
58 - Hey, Kelso.\\
59 - I thought we'd get
together tonight,\\
60 - so take a shower, okay?\\
61 - Laurie, I'm... I'm seeing
Jackie tonight.\\
62 - Oh, that's so sweet.\\
63 - Uh, no.
I'll see you at 8:00.\\
64 - But...\\
65 - You heard me.\\
66 - Damn.\\
67 - My second girlfriend
is such a drag.\\
68 - This is bad, man.\\
69 - Yes, but only for you.\\
70 - Cheese puff?\\
71 - Looks pretty good, Mr. Clean.\\
72 - Well, you know me.\\
73 - I'm...\\
74 - Super neat.\\
75 - Hey, you know, I can't find
Mr. Bonkers anywhere.\\
76 - Have you seen him?
No!\\
77 - Uh, I mean...\\
78 - Well...\\
79 - Yeah, not since last night.\\
80 - Huh. Well...\\
81 - Meow, meow, meow, meow.\\
82 - Killed...\\
83 - Meow, meow.\\
84 - What?\\
85 - I said, it's weird.\\
86 - He always sleeps with me,\\
87 - but he never came
home last night.\\
88 - Let me know
if you see him, okay?\\
89 - Oh...\\
90 - Sure thing. Will do. Okay.\\
91 - Mr. Bonkers?\\
92 - Yeah, I'm goin' to hell.\\
93 - So you didn't tell her?\\
94 - I felt so guilty.
I just...\\
95 - I couldn't.\\
96 - Is it because you're
kinda glad it's dead?\\
97 - No.\\
98 - Hey, maybe I don't
have to tell her.\\
99 - Maybe she'll just think
Mr. Bonkers ran away.\\
100 - That works. That's
what we told you when...\\
101 - Shh!\\
102 - What?\\
103 - Eric, honey,
eat your pizza rolls.\\
104 - Oh, come on.
How hard can this be?\\
105 - You go over there and you say,\\
106 - "Hey, I'm a cat killer.
I murdered..."\\
107 - "I murdered your cat."\\
108 - But you try to say it
with a straight face.\\
109 - What?\\
110 - Am I the only one that sees
the humor in this?\\
111 - I think you might be, Red.\\
112 - Oh, come on. That thing
was always messin' in my yard,\\
113 - goin' through our garbage.\\
114 - Now we have Hyde for that.\\
115 - Oh, yeah, Laurie, and
what exactly do you do?\\
116 - Oh! That's
right. The Packers.\\
117 - Excuse me.
Dilemma here?\\
118 - Eric, this is not a dilemma.\\
119 - You have to tell Donna.\\
120 - Just be gentle, and maybe
take her a nice little gift.\\
121 - Yeah, like
a kitty-sized headstone.\\
122 - You know what? I should've
known you were lying.\\
123 - Sure, Flipper was fast,\\
124 - but turtles don't just run away.\\
125 - Hyde, which one's your
favorite Charlie's Angel?\\
126 - I kinda like the blonde
with the huge rack.\\
127 - Yes. And she distracts the
criminals with her huge rack.\\
128 - Plus, she's got that huge
rack. Yeah.\\
129 - Oh, my stomach.\\
130 - My cheesy, puffy friends
have become my enemy.\\
131 - Man...\\
132 - You guys...\\
133 - I gotta break up with Laurie.\\
134 - Kelso, remember how you said
you were gonna juggle 'em both\\
135 - till it blew up in
your face? Yeah?\\
136 - Well...\\
137 - Kablooey!\\
138 - Okay, I know I tried
before, right?\\
139 - But this time, Laurie'll see
how much I love Jackie\\
140 - and that my motives
are good and pure.\\
141 - And then she'll just let me go.\\
142 - Then you and all the
leprechauns can ride unicorns\\
143 - to a wonderful
celebration in Fairyland.\\
144 - Look! The Angels are
runnin' in slow motion.\\
145 - Damn!
Damn!\\
146 - That's just good TV.\\
147 - Hey, beautiful.\\
148 - How's it goin'?\\
149 - Oh, pretty good.\\
150 - Except, I found this here kitten\\
151 - who told me he was looking
for someone to love him.\\
152 - Oh, my God!\\
153 - Oh, he's so cute.\\
154 - Thank you, Eric.
That's so sweet.\\
155 - Oh, I hope Mr. Bonkers
doesn't get jealous.\\
156 - Hi.\\
157 - Yeah. I don't think that's gonna
happen, Donna, because...\\
158 - I accidentally
killed Mr. Bonkers.\\
159 - So! What're you gonna name
this little fella here?\\
160 - What? What are
you talking about?\\
161 - I've had that cat since I
was three. What happened?\\
162 - Well...\\
163 - Last night, I was pulling
in the car after our date...\\
164 - After our date?\\
165 - Last night?\\
166 - Eric, I was looking for him,
and I asked you.\\
167 - And you said
you hadn't seen him.\\
168 - And you knew I was
worried sick about him.\\
169 - I know, Donna. That's why
it was so hard to tell you.\\
170 - Hey there, ho there, hi there.\\
171 - What's goin' on?\\
172 - Why don't you ask the man
who murdered our cat?\\
173 - No! No! That's...\\
174 - No, I didn't
murder your cat. It was...\\
175 - He climbed under my car.
It was a total accident.\\
176 - Well, I should hope so, because
what did he ever do to you?\\
177 - I don't want to live
with this lie anymore,\\
178 - because I only love Jackie.\\
179 - Okay.\\
180 - So, do you want to go up
to my room and have sex?\\
181 - Uh...\\
182 - Sure!\\
183 - No, wait!\\
184 - No! No!\\
185 - Okay. I just...
This...\\
186 - Laurie, I...
I'm serious.\\
187 - We are over.\\
188 - Wow! I think
you really mean it.\\
189 - I totally do.\\
190 - Okay, Kelso, you're free.\\
191 - You know what I'd like, though?\\
192 - Just one last good-bye kiss?\\
193 - Um...\\
194 - Okay, well, sure.\\
195 - Michael!\\
196 - Jackie!\\
197 - We were...\\
198 - No! There was...\\
199 - Wow! How ironic, huh?\\
200 - Eric, I just saw Michael
kissing your sister.\\
201 - Okay, he's a rat!
He's been cheating on me!\\
202 - What? Well...\\
203 - Surely, there must be
some kind of mistake!\\
204 - Right, guys? Come on.\\
205 - Well, it sure is a mind-blower.\\
206 - So that's it.
Michael and I are over.\\
207 - Really?\\
208 - And by "over" you mean...\\
209 - I mean over and done!
All right? Forever.\\
210 - Uh-huh. Now, by "forever"
you mean...\\
211 - And after everything
I put up with!\\
212 - I mean, God, him taking
Pam Macy to the prom,\\
213 - setting my house on fire,
lying about Laurie...\\
214 - God!\\
215 - To be fair, that's only
the stuff you know about.\\
216 - This is incredible.\\
217 - My time has come.\\
218 - Today, I will make Jackie mine!\\
219 - Hey, what's wrong?\\
220 - I don't know. I think my
guts are bursting with love.\\
221 - So, Fez, my mom says your
appendix has to come out.\\
222 - Man, you must be
in tons of pain.\\
223 - Whee!\\
224 - Cheese puffs out, pain pills in.\\
225 - Fez loves his pills.\\
226 - Boy, I wish there was
a pill I could take.\\
227 - Get rid of my pain.\\
228 - A forget-about-Jackie pill.\\
229 - Hell, if they made
that pill, I'd take it.\\
230 - Kelso, man, this is what you get\\
231 - for tryin' to do
the right thing.\\
232 - Want to know a secret?\\
233 - I'm not wearing anything
under my dress.\\
234 - Look.\\
235 - Whoa! Put that away!\\
236 - Yeah. Man, it... It just sucks
when you try to do the right thing.\\
237 - And then she yells at you
for killin' her cat.\\
238 - Eric,\\
239 - you don't know
how lucky you are.\\
240 - I would give anything to be
able to tell Jackie I killed her cat.\\
241 - Nothin' sadder than
when two people break up.\\
242 - Except this time,
when it's funny.\\
243 - By the way, Eric...\\
244 - If your mom ever says,
"Ready for your catheter?"\\
245 - The answer is no.\\
246 - Donna, we're
supposed to be friends.\\
247 - Would it have killed you to say,\\
248 - "I know you love him,
but Michael's a jerk"?\\
249 - Jackie, I think
my exact words were,\\
250 - "I know you love him,
but Michael's a jerk."\\
251 - So...\\
252 - Have you seen Kelso since...\\
253 - No. I mean, he's a
liar and a cheater.\\
254 - Ugh, maybe that's
how all guys are.\\
255 - I know how you feel.\\
256 - Like, it's bad enough what
Eric did to Mr. Bonkers.\\
257 - Then he lied to me.\\
258 - Yeah.\\
259 - Eric put off
telling you something\\
260 - because he didn't want
to hurt you.\\
261 - Whoo! That is so much worse than
cheating on you with another woman.\\
262 - Oh, wait.\\
263 - No, it's not!\\
264 - Oh.\\
265 - Wow.\\
266 - I guess Eric was
just trying to be nice.\\
267 - Maybe I'm overreacting.\\
268 - Look. Let me tell you
something, Donna.\\
269 - Until goody-goody Eric cheats
on you with your stupid dead cat,\\
270 - I suggest you shut up.\\
271 - Ugh, I miss Jackie.\\
272 - I know!\\
273 - Well, you're in luck, Fez.\\
274 - The bars closed early today,\\
275 - so we found a doctor
to do your surgery.\\
276 - Oh. Good. I see they've
already shaved you.\\
277 - Actually, I did that myself.\\
278 - Lucky coincidence, huh?\\
279 - Okay, then.\\
280 - Time for sleepy-sleepy.\\
281 - Okay, now, count back from 100.\\
282 - 100.\\
283 - 99.\\
284 - Charlie's Angels.\\
285 - Once upon a time,
there were three little girls\\
286 - who went to the police academy.\\
287 - Now they work for me.\\
288 - My name is Fez.\\
289 - Stand back.\\
290 - And remember, girls,\\
291 - this one's for Fez.\\
292 - This is your unlucky day,\\
293 - now that Fez's Angels are here.\\
294 - Don't move.\\
295 - I'm gonna blow up
Fez headquarters.\\
296 - I can't bear to see any of you\\
297 - with such a handsome,
foreign sex machine.\\
298 - This is gonna be a blast.\\
299 - Whatever.\\
300 - Whoa!\\
301 - Ah!\\
302 - You're a real barrel of laughs.\\
303 - Congratulations,
and a job well done, Angels.\\
304 - Thank you, Fez.\\
305 - Are we going to see you soon?\\
306 - No, I can't get away.\\
307 - I'm in a little
hot water right now.\\
308 - Fez. Fez, honey?\\
309 - Oh, thank God
you pulled through.\\
310 - I was afraid you'd die
before I got to tell you...\\
311 - I love you.\\
312 - No, no, Jackie.\\
313 - No sex now.\\
314 - We must wait.\\
315 - Until we're married?\\
316 - No.\\
317 - Until the catheter comes out.\\
318 - Fez?\\
319 - Fez?\\
320 - Fez?\\
321 - Fez?\\
322 - I told you,
no sex now!\\
323 - Hey there, Midge.\\
324 - Kitty, uh, insisted
I bring this over\\
325 - to show our sorrow
because of your loss.\\
326 - Aw, thanks, Red.
We were all sittin' around\\
327 - reminiscing about
our dear departed cat,\\
328 - Mr. Bonkers J. Pinciotti.\\
329 - Do you have a story
you want to share, Red?\\
330 - We'd sure appreciate it, seein'
as how your son killed him.\\
331 - Okay.\\
332 - Well, I remember he used to
come into my yard and, uh...\\
333 - And, uh...\\
334 - You know, I'd
throw a bucket at him,\\
335 - or spray him with a hose,\\
336 - and he'd run away.\\
337 - Then he'd come back.\\
338 - I'd do it again.\\
339 - I guess you...\\
340 - You could say we
kinda had our own thing.\\
341 - Wow.\\
342 - Well...
Okay.\\
343 - Enjoy the casserole.\\
344 - We set up a Mr. Bonkers memorial
slide show in the other room.\\
345 - So...\\
346 - Uh-huh.\\
347 - Uh...\\
348 - That casserole there
is a seven-layer.\\
349 - Of course, uh, two of
those layers are peas,\\
350 - and I really should've told
you right away about your cat,\\
351 - but it's a pretty good
casserole. There's ham in it.\\
352 - Look, Eric, I know you didn't want
to hurt me, and I understand that.\\
353 - It's just\\
354 - we've gotta be honest
with each other.\\
355 - I mean, especially
now that we've...\\
356 - You know...\\
357 - We've...\\
358 - You know?\\
359 - 'Cause I just don't want to
end up like Jackie and Kelso.\\
360 - No, no. I don't think
we're gonna end up like Jackie and Kelso.\\
361 - I mean, I lied out of the
goodness of my heart.\\
362 - It's still a lie, Eric.\\
363 - Yeah. You're right.\\
364 - I'm sorry, Donna,\\
365 - about everything.\\
366 - All right. well, from
now on, no more secrets.\\
367 - Oh! God, then I guess
I have to come clean.\\
368 - Okay.\\
369 - In first grade,
behind your back,\\
370 - I used to call you
"Donna Pinch-my-Butty."\\
371 - Well,
you know, Eric, that's okay.\\
372 - 'Cause I was the first one
to call you "Eric Foreskin."\\
373 - You started that?
Yeah.\\
374 - That's not funny.
That one stuck.\\
375 - Oh, shut up, Foreskin.\\
376 - So,
really, breaking up with Michael could be\\
377 - the start of something great.\\
378 - I am a whole new Jackie.\\
379 - Really?\\
380 - 'Cause you're babblin'
like the old Jackie.\\
381 - Jackie. I've been
lookin' for you.\\
382 - Here I am.\\
383 - Okay, so...
Yeah.\\
384 - Yeah, you two probably
want to be alone.\\
385 - No, Forman.\\
386 - How can this not
be good? Come on.\\
387 - All right.\\
388 - Jackie, I've
done some terrible and stupid things.\\
389 - Too many to even list.\\
390 - Oh, hey, give it a shot, man.\\
391 - I'll fill in the blanks.\\
392 - Hyde.\\
393 - All right, but I'm done
making excuses.\\
394 - And all I can say is...\\
395 - Is that I'm sorry
and I love you.\\
396 - And I will do whatever I can,\\
397 - every day from now on,\\
398 - so that you know that's true.\\
399 - So, will you please,\\
400 - please,\\
401 - please take me back?\\
402 - Oh, Michael.\\
403 - No.\\
404 - No... No, you know what?
We're through.\\
405 - Forever.\\
406 - Whoa. Didn't see
that comin'.\\
407 - Fine.\\
408 - So, um...\\
409 - That... That was the
smartest thing I've ever done.\\
410 - And, um...\\
411 - And the best.\\
412 - Oh...\\
413 - Hyde.\\
414 - Why does she always come to me?\\
415 - You are a dog,
Michael, a dirty, dirty dog!\\
416 - You are an idiot,
and science is stupid!\\
417 - I have had it with you!\\
418 - You are weird,
and I'm going home.\\
419 - If you're not telling
the truth, I will find out.\\
420 - 'Cause I'm smart,
and you aren't.\\
421 - I am in love with a doofus.\\
422 - All the memories.
\subsection {Episode 21: Kelso's Serenade}
1 - Donna, have you noticed that
every time we do the... Ahem.\\
2 - What we just did...\\
3 - It is always fun?\\
4 - Eric, you're so cute.\\
5 - Ow! Ow!\\
6 - Donna, I think by "Cute,"
you mean...\\
7 - Ruggedly handsome.\\
8 - You read my mind, Eric.\\
9 - Oh, yeah.
That's the other thing.\\
10 - After we do... The thing,\\
11 - I don't really feel
like an "Eric."\\
12 - Really?\\
13 - Uh, yeah. I think
I feel more like a Stan.\\
14 - Or... A Chuck.\\
15 - Or a...\\
16 - A Maverick.\\
17 - So do you want to go to
a movie tomorrow, Maverick?\\
18 - Oh, uh, I told Kelso and Fez
I'd hang out with them.\\
19 - Really? Oh.\\
20 - Hey, but, you can
come, too, if you want.\\
21 - No. It's okay.\\
22 - Uh, really, you should come.\\
23 - No. You go.
Have fun.\\
24 - Are you sure?\\
25 - Sure. It's no big deal.\\
26 - Okay, cool.\\
27 - Hanging out\\
28 - Down the street\\
29 - The same old thing\\
30 - We did last week\\
31 - Not a thing to do\\
32 - But talk to you\\
33 - We're all, all right\\
34 - We're all, all right\\
35 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
36 - Swedish pancakes?
What's the catch?\\
37 - Oh, no catch. Eat 'em while
they're hot. There's plenty.\\
38 - Well, this is a real treat,
Mrs. Forman.\\
39 - Psst. Careful, Steven.\\
40 - There's always a string
attached to Swedish pancakes.\\
41 - Trust me.\\
42 - Mom, you only make
Swedish pancakes\\
43 - when something horrible's
about to happen.\\
44 - Does someone have cancer?\\
45 - No, no, no. No one
has horrible cancer.\\
46 - Ha ha ha ha!\\
47 - Now, let's just
sit down as a family\\
48 - and enjoy our special pancakes.\\
49 - Gotcha!
Ha ha ha ha.\\
50 - We're all going to the nursing
home to visit Aunt Pearl.\\
51 - Oh...
Aw...\\
52 - Isn't she dead yet?\\
53 - Laurie!
Well, I mean she is old, so...\\
54 - Maybe we should call ahead.\\
55 - Red, can you believe
this family?\\
56 - Well, the Bucks are
playing the Celtics.\\
57 - Oh, come on!\\
58 - All I'm asking is
for a quick visit.\\
59 - Real quick.
Quick, quick, quick.\\
60 - Say, kids, how about a
nice trip to old Aunt Pearl's?\\
61 - Oh...
Oh...\\
62 - Hey!\\
63 - Thank you, Red.\\
64 - I don't have to go, do I?\\
65 - I've already been to see
her three times this year.\\
66 - Oh, yeah. And
I'm a virgin.\\
67 - God, I miss Jackie.\\
68 - I can't sleep.\\
69 - I can't think.\\
70 - I can still eat, but...\\
71 - I mean, my life has no meaning.\\
72 - I'm dead inside.\\
73 - Oh, so that's what smells.\\
74 - Yeah, Mr. Broken heart.\\
75 - When was the last time
you took a bath, man?\\
76 - Whew, you're getting gamy.\\
77 - Man, I am so glad
Donna's not Jackie.\\
78 - But I'll tell you what.\\
79 - I'm even more glad I'm not you.\\
80 - No offense.\\
81 - I gotta win Jackie back.\\
82 - I got it!
I'll write her a song!\\
83 - Maybe the best way
to get Jackie back\\
84 - is to let her date other people,
foreign exchange people.\\
85 - No, man. I think a song
is a really great idea.\\
86 - How about this one?\\
87 - You don't love me anymore\\
88 - You caught me cheatin'
With a whore\\
89 - See? 'Cause
Laurie's the whore.\\
90 - You get it?\\
91 - Yeah. My sister
is such a whore.\\
92 - Yeah, I'm gonna write
Jackie a song.\\
93 - I gotta win her back because
I can't stop the tears, man!\\
94 - Kelso? We've been over this.\\
95 - There's no crying in the circle.\\
96 - And then Eric says, "You
can come... If you want."\\
97 - "If you want?"\\
98 - Ouch.\\
99 - Right?\\
100 - I don't know, I think he's
sort of taking me for granted.\\
101 - Ah, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just overreacting.\\
102 - No, Donna.
You're underreacting.\\
103 - All men take all women
for granted...\\
104 - All the time.\\
105 - Jackie...\\
106 - Save yourself
the heartache, Donna.\\
107 - Break up with Eric now
before it's too late.\\
108 - Then we can be
single girls together.\\
109 - Ooh! We could take
a cruise!\\
110 - I don't know.
I'm just worried.\\
111 - I mean, if he's acting
like this now,\\
112 - imagine what it'll be like
if we got, like...\\
113 - Married or something.\\
114 - Gloria, I just looked at her!
She was giving me change!\\
115 - No, Michael!
It wasn't a look.\\
116 - It was a look.\\
117 - Oh, my!
Please don't fight.\\
118 - Your father will be home
any minute.\\
119 - Wow, Ma!
You're all dressed up!\\
120 - Oh, yeah. Your father's
taking me out tonight.\\
121 - Good for you, Ma.
You deserve a night out.\\
122 - Well, ho, ho, ho and
whoop-di-doo. I'm home.\\
123 - Oh, hi, Archie.\\
124 - Ah, jeez, Edith, no time
for the kisses there, okay?\\
125 - The fight's about to start.\\
126 - But, Daddy, you told Ma you
were taking her out tonight.\\
127 - That's true, Arch.\\
128 - Shut up, you meathead, you!\\
129 - Well, if you ask my opinion,
maybe you just forgot.\\
130 - Ah, jeez, Edith, I didn't
forget nothin' there,\\
131 - so get me a beer
and stifle there, huh?\\
132 - Oh, my...\\
133 - Oh, my God, Jackie.\\
134 - What am I gonna do?\\
135 - I don't know, Donna.\\
136 - I just don't know.\\
137 - Oh, hi, Mr. Forman.\\
138 - Go talk on your own damn porch.\\
139 - So... You've been playing
much bingo, Pearl?\\
140 - Oh, for God's sakes, Kitty,
I ate your damn pudding.\\
141 - So go!\\
142 - Laurie, say something nice.\\
143 - Fine. Something nice.\\
144 - That's my magazine.\\
145 - Nobody needs to see that.\\
146 - Get out!\\
147 - You know, it's weird.\\
148 - But I thought after me
and Michael broke up,\\
149 - I wouldn't want to
hang out here anymore.\\
150 - Yep. That's what
we were hoping.\\
151 - But I think if I left,
you'd really miss me.\\
152 - Right?
Ahem.\\
153 - I, uh, I suppose...\\
154 - That, um, you know,
it's important\\
155 - when you have a bad breakup\\
156 - that you find friends to, uh...\\
157 - Uh, sympathetic...\\
158 - Uh, stuff...\\
159 - Um, support and, uh...\\
160 - I don't know.\\
161 - Right.\\
162 - So let's go to the mall.\\
163 - I meant friends
like Donna or... Not me.\\
164 - But I noticed
you're alone a lot,\\
165 - and I'm alone a lot,
so let's be alone together.\\
166 - Look, we're alone right now.\\
167 - That's not really a very
good reason for us to...\\
168 - Wait.\\
169 - Let's go to Sizzler.\\
170 - They've got a salad bar.\\
171 - It's all you can eat.\\
172 - Plus five different colors
of Jell-O.\\
173 - I'll buy.\\
174 - You've been through
a rough time.\\
175 - Let's go, kid.\\
176 - A song for Jackie.\\
177 - By Michael Kelso.\\
178 - You may think
This song is stupid\\
179 - So I made a call
To Cupid\\
180 - And he told me to put
My heart out on my sleeve\\
181 - So we can retrieve
Our love from the trash\\
182 - Trash, Trash\\
183 - So what do you think?\\
184 - Well, I think that...\\
185 - You should draw her a picture.\\
186 - Hey, pal...
You think you're funny?\\
187 - Well, just wait,
'cause someday Donna's\\
188 - gonna crush your stupid
little heart, too.\\
189 - Yeah. Ahem.
See, I don't think so\\
190 - because I've taken special precautions
to prevent that very thing from happening.\\
191 - Uh, like, for instance,\\
192 - I... Don't sleep
with other women.\\
193 - Yeah?\\
194 - Well... It's only
'cause you're chicken.\\
195 - Hey.\\
196 - Hey, baby.\\
197 - What say you grab Papa
a root beer, huh?\\
198 - Oh, my God.
I cannot look.\\
199 - Listen, you worm,
I am not your slave\\
200 - or a waitress or your damn maid!\\
201 - And don't get all
Archie Bunker-y on me,\\
202 - or I will kick your ass
to the moon!\\
203 - Hey, Eric, what rhymes
with Donna?\\
204 - I didn't mean to cheat
But she forced me\\
205 - She Downright Coerced Me\\
206 - Hey, that's kinda good.\\
207 - Man, I just asked her
for a root beer.\\
208 - You tried to control her, Eric.\\
209 - And the woman always
controls the man.\\
210 - That's true.
Donna does not control me!\\
211 - Oh, Eric, you have so much
to learn, my friend.\\
212 - Yeah. I wish Jackie
was still controlling me.\\
213 - I love being on a short leash.\\
214 - Put the short leash
Back on me\\
215 - Kelso, let me see that
for a second.\\
216 - Yeah.\\
217 - You know, that's kinda funny.
That was your guitar.\\
218 - Burn!\\
219 - Hyde, those boots
look really nice on you.\\
220 - You know, Jackie, you
buying me boots is just wrong.\\
221 - You should've let me
shoplift them.\\
222 - No, Hyde. I want you
to have them.\\
223 - Besides, I'm saving a fortune\\
224 - now that I don't have to
feed and clothe Michael.\\
225 - Well, if you insist.\\
226 - I do. So I was thinking
tomorrow night,\\
227 - we should, you know...\\
228 - Whoa, okay. All right now,
come on, Jackie.\\
229 - This was a one time only
thing, all right?\\
230 - If you're trying to bribe me with these
boots, man, you can just take them back.\\
231 - I see.\\
232 - Oh, what are you
gonna do now, cry?\\
233 - Oh, man, you're crying.\\
234 - Hey, Jackie...\\
235 - Come on, man.\\
236 - It's gonna be fine, okay?
You're gonna be fine.\\
237 - This whole thing is
gonna be fine, all right?\\
238 - No!\\
239 - Bad Jackie!\\
240 - But, Hyde, I thought we agreed\\
241 - that you were alone
and I was alone...\\
242 - Jackie, I'm trying to help
you out here, all right?\\
243 - So just listen to me.\\
244 - You gotta realize that you
can do better than Kelso.\\
245 - But what if I never find
anybody else?\\
246 - Oh, you will, man.
You'll find somebody great.\\
247 - You see, I, myself,
don't like you.\\
248 - I find you abrasive.\\
249 - But if I didn't know you
and I had never talked to you,\\
250 - I'd think you were totally hot.\\
251 - Thank you, Hyde.\\
252 - Anything for you, doll.\\
253 - Pearl, honey, please come out.\\
254 - Oh! Laurie, she kinda
likes you. Do something.\\
255 - Aunt Pearl!\\
256 - Why don't you come out, and you can
show me your damn scrapbooks again?\\
257 - Every time you people come,\\
258 - I gotta get dressed
and put my teeth in.\\
259 - And you're not worth it,
so get lost!\\
260 - Now can we go?\\
261 - No. Ahem.\\
262 - Okay, fine. You know what?
I give up.\\
263 - Let's just go.\\
264 - I just hope when I get old,
someone comes to visit me.\\
265 - Don't be ridiculous, Mom.
Eric will come.\\
266 - Well, I'm gonna go warm
the car up.\\
267 - No, Laurie.\\
268 - This is important
to your mother.\\
269 - So sit down.\\
270 - Come on, Pearl.
There's a Bucks game on.\\
271 - The Bucks, huh?\\
272 - Oh-ho!\\
273 - Well, you know, see?\\
274 - This is nice.\\
275 - The only thing
that keeps me alive\\
276 - is watching the
Bucks lose. Pfft!\\
277 - Go Bucks.\\
278 - Michael, no. I don't
want to talk to you.\\
279 - No. You're right.\\
280 - Okay? Because words
don't do it.\\
281 - That's why I wrote this song.\\
282 - Oh, God.\\
283 - Jackie, please
Take me backie\\
284 - I'll get the knack, see\\
285 - Okay, Michael, stop.\\
286 - Michael, stop.\\
287 - Yes, please, Kelso, stop.\\
288 - I cannot take this anymore.\\
289 - This is how you
serenade a woman.\\
290 - Besame\\
291 - Besame mucho\\
292 - Como si fuera
esta noche\\
293 - La ultima vez\\
294 - What are you doing?\\
295 - Yeah. What are you doing?\\
296 - Um, this is my school
song from back home.\\
297 - I don't love you.\\
298 - Hey, what's going on?\\
299 - Nothing.\\
300 - Nothing at all.\\
301 - Thank you, Hyde, for tonight.\\
302 - It was very special.\\
303 - Oh!
Aiee.\\
304 - Isn't she nice?\\
305 - Hey, fellas, you
like my new boots?\\
306 - So, then Eric says to Donna,\\
307 - "I cannot go out with you,\\
308 - "because I'm going out
with the guys."\\
309 - Oh, jeez.\\
310 - What? I don't think
that's the problem.\\
311 - No. What's his name's right.
That's the problem.\\
312 - Look, I don't think
I did anything wrong.\\
313 - I'm not going to
apologize to Donna.\\
314 - Oh, yeah?\\
315 - What? Why?\\
316 - Here's the thing.\\
317 - You're assuming that you're
good enough for Donna.\\
318 - And you're not.\\
319 - Yes, I am.\\
320 - No, you're not.\\
321 - Just like I'm not
good enough for your mother.\\
322 - Okay, well...\\
323 - Yeah, that's true.\\
324 - Hey, watch it. I'm trying
to help you out here.\\
325 - I'm sorry. Yes, sir.\\
326 - Look, do you really think I wanted
to spend the whole damn day\\
327 - sitting in a room with a woman who
hates the Bucks and smells like cabbage?\\
328 - Well, I didn't.\\
329 - But that's the price
you pay, son.\\
330 - Now, you go call Donna
before she realizes\\
331 - how much better off
she is without you.\\
332 - Go on now. Go!\\
333 - Go! You heard him, go!\\
334 - But what about...\\
335 - Blah, blah, blah.
Make the call, little man.\\
336 - Listen, Donna...\\
337 - No. Wait.\\
338 - I've been thinking about...
You know...\\
339 - What happened.\\
340 - And I realize
I may have overreacted.\\
341 - It's just that I'm
a little vulnerable now\\
342 - that our relationship
is... Matured.\\
343 - Donna, no apology necessary.\\
344 - I welcome your insane
behavior and criticism.\\
345 - Don't be a jerk, Eric.\\
346 - No. No. Uh, ahem, I'm
actually... I'm being serious.\\
347 - I'm willing to do...\\
348 - Whatever it takes
for us to be together.\\
349 - Whatever it takes.\\
350 - It's worth it.\\
351 - Well... Thank you.\\
352 - So, uh, for future reference,\\
353 - do I have to ask you before
I go out with my friends?\\
354 - No.\\
355 - Uh... Yes.\\
356 - Sometimes.\\
357 - So, uh, how will
I know which times?\\
358 - Well, you'll know afterwards
when I get mad.\\
359 - Okay.
Yeah.\\
360 - Uh, is there, you know,\\
361 - maybe a better system than that?\\
362 - No. I really can't
think of one. No.\\
363 - Okay, fair enough. Okay.\\
364 - I'm really sorry.\\
365 - Me, too.\\
366 - So, I blew off the guys tonight\\
367 - to hang out with you.\\
368 - So my calendar is wide open.\\
369 - I'm... I'm here
for you, Donna.\\
370 - Oh, that's too bad.
I'm hanging out with Jackie.\\
371 - You could come if you want.\\
372 - Ha ha ha.
That's really not funny.\\
373 - So, Aunt...\\
374 - Shh!\\
375 - I was wondering...\\
376 - Shh!
Okay.
\subsection {Episode 22: Jackie Moves On}
1 - Oh, hey, you guys,\\
2 - guess what part of my body\\
3 - I nicknamed Pink Floyd?\\
4 - Shut up.\\
5 - Well, Jackie
thought it was cute.\\
6 - Well, Jackie's not here anymore.\\
7 - I was over at
Jackie's this morning.\\
8 - She is so down.
It's really depressing.\\
9 - She's taking the breakup
pretty hard, huh?\\
10 - Cool.\\
11 - Shut up, man.
You cried like a baby.\\
12 - Whoa, I did not cry.\\
13 - I had something in my eye.\\
14 - For a week?\\
15 - I have allergies, all right?\\
16 - Is it so wrong to feel?\\
17 - Anyway, Jackie's, like,
in really bad shape.\\
18 - So, Kelso, now that
you and Jackie\\
19 - are no longer an item...\\
20 - Um, I can ask her out, right?\\
21 - What? No. Since when
do you like Jackie?\\
22 - Yeah, Fez, I don't
think that's a good idea.\\
23 - Yeah, Fez, man,
that's a bad idea.\\
24 - Jackie's on
the rebound right now.\\
25 - Why don't you just
give her a break?\\
26 - What?\\
27 - Since when do you like Jackie?\\
28 - All right, does everybody
here now like Jackie?\\
29 - I still don't.\\
30 - Well, thank you, Eric.\\
31 - Fez, Hyde's just saying that
Jackie's really vulnerable right now.\\
32 - Yes, so I must move fast\\
33 - before she gets
her self-esteem back.\\
34 - Yeah, you can't blame
her for being down.\\
35 - After all, I did dump her.\\
36 - Actually, she dumped you.\\
37 - Hey, I don't like
to get into specifics.\\
38 - Oh, go tell it on the mountain.\\
39 - Nothing will stop me from
asking Jackie on a date.\\
40 - Not even ninjas.\\
41 - Stand back.\\
42 - I want Jackie, and
no one will stop me.\\
43 - You cannot have Jackie.\\
44 - I will disable you with
my cat-like swiftness.\\
45 - Oh, yeah?\\
46 - Yeah.\\
47 - Oh, yeah?\\
48 - Yeah.\\
49 - Oh.\\
50 - Hiya!\\
51 - Fez.
What?\\
52 - Go ahead, Fez.
Ask Jackie out.\\
53 - She won't go 'cause
you're foreign,\\
54 - but go ahead and ask.\\
55 - You're damn right I will.\\
56 - Hiya.\\
57 - Hangin' out\\
58 - Down the street\\
59 - The same old thing\\
60 - We did last week\\
61 - Not a thing to do\\
62 - But talk to you\\
63 - We're all all right\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
66 - No, Laurie,
I am not giving you $15\\
67 - for new hot rollers.\\
68 - Straight hair is not
the end of the world.\\
69 - Actually, Mom, Laurie's
world is a lot smaller\\
70 - and much more shallow
than the average person's.\\
71 - Come on, Mom. Curls are
important for my self-esteem.\\
72 - Oh, you know what else might
be good for your self-esteem?\\
73 - Not being the village whore.\\
74 - Are you trying to start
something with me, little boy?\\
75 - Because while
you have to go to work,\\
76 - all I have to do is sit around\\
77 - and think up ways to hurt you.\\
78 - Oh, I don't know.\\
79 - As village whore, I'd
think your day's all full up.\\
80 - Shut up!\\
81 - Ha! I win.\\
82 - You're both wrong, so can it.\\
83 - You're dead.\\
84 - Ooh, I'm...
I'm so scared.\\
85 - Kitty...\\
86 - You remember that little, uh,\\
87 - French restaurant downtown?\\
88 - Frenchie's?\\
89 - The one and only.\\
90 - I made reservations for tonight.\\
91 - Forman, party of two.\\
92 - Well, now, this is so
spontaneous of you, Red.\\
93 - You haven't been reading
my Cosmo, have you?\\
94 - Come on, Kitty,
we'll get all dressed up.\\
95 - You can even wear
my mother's necklace.\\
96 - Oh...\\
97 - The necklace, yay.\\
98 - Come on, Eric,
we're gonna be late.\\
99 - Bye, Mom.\\
100 - Bye, honey.\\
101 - Oh, this is awful.\\
102 - Come on, Mom. French
food's not that bad.\\
103 - Just order pommes frites.\\
104 - They're French fries, you know?\\
105 - No, honey, the necklace.
I don't have it anymore.\\
106 - What'd you do with it?\\
107 - Nothing.
I said nothing.\\
108 - Mom, did you gamble
the necklace away?\\
109 - Okay, stop it, Laurie.
I'll make you get a job.\\
110 - Bye.\\
111 - Okay, Fez.\\
112 - Asking Jackie out is
a big opportunity for you.\\
113 - And if she says no, don't cry.\\
114 - Just be witty and polite.\\
115 - Stick to the script.\\
116 - And most importantly,\\
117 - speak slowly and enunciate.\\
118 - Hello.\\
119 - "Hello, Jackie, how
are you doing today?\\
120 - "I am fine. Nice
weather lately, huh?\\
121 - "Would you like to go out
to dinner with me tonight?"\\
122 - Okay.\\
123 - Wait, who is this?\\
124 - It's me, Fez.\\
125 - Oh.\\
126 - Okay.\\
127 - I just thought that
since you and Kelso\\
128 - are no longer dating...\\
129 - How is Michael doing?\\
130 - Uh, fine, I guess.\\
131 - Actually, he seems dumber.\\
132 - Well, you know what,
that's great.\\
133 - 'Cause I'm doing fine, too.\\
134 - Just fine.\\
135 - Well, if you are
fine, then I'm dandy.\\
136 - You... You and
me, fine and dandy.\\
137 - Did you hang up?\\
138 - No.\\
139 - Pick you up
at 8:00?\\
140 - Fine.\\
141 - Dandy.\\
142 - Okay.\\
143 - I'm all ready, so let's go.\\
144 - Wow, you look great.\\
145 - And you look sharp
yourself, so let's go.\\
146 - Hey, weren't you going to
wear my mother's necklace?\\
147 - Here it is.\\
148 - Doesn't it look nice?\\
149 - I tuck it in so I won't lose it.\\
150 - So, let's hit the road.\\
151 - Well, you know,
that didn't really\\
152 - look like the one
that she gave you.\\
153 - Well, sure it does.\\
154 - It looks just like it
because it is it.\\
155 - Now look who's getting old.\\
156 - Doesn't even remember what
necklace his mother gave me.\\
157 - So, let's move it out.\\
158 - Boy, Laurie, you
really liked that hot dog.\\
159 - You didn't even chew it.\\
160 - Oh, hey, Hyde,\\
161 - Father's Day is coming up.\\
162 - Shouldn't you practice
saying "Hi, are you my daddy?"\\
163 - Oh, by the way, Laurie,
the surgeon general called.\\
164 - He wanted you to stop
hoarding all the penicillin.\\
165 - You know, when you're in prison,\\
166 - your bad table manners
will probably just be a turn-on\\
167 - for some guy named Tank.\\
168 - Oh, well, maybe when
you're there for a conjugal visit,\\
169 - you can ask him
to take it easy on me.\\
170 - Oh, yeah, well...\\
171 - Nice hair.\\
172 - Oh, Laurie.\\
173 - Are you all out of put-downs?\\
174 - Yeah, I guess
I'm having an off day.\\
175 - Even Eric burned me.\\
176 - Eric burned you?\\
177 - You are totally lame.\\
178 - I know, isn't
that pathetic? Eric.\\
179 - What about me?\\
180 - Speaking of
the spindly-armed devil.\\
181 - What's so pathetic?\\
182 - Nothing.\\
183 - At least nothing we can
share with you, gomer.\\
184 - Oh, yeah, well...\\
185 - Nice hair.\\
186 - What?\\
187 - So, Jackie, how's your
very expensive dinner?\\
188 - Mmm.\\
189 - It's great.\\
190 - And I'm not replacing
Michael with food.\\
191 - Are you going to finish that?\\
192 - Oh, that's okay.\\
193 - You know this restaurant
is very well known\\
194 - for their
very expensive dinners,\\
195 - but for you it's...\\
196 - Pass the butter.\\
197 - Ah, the butter.\\
198 - That reminds me
of an amusing anecdote.\\
199 - Um...\\
200 - Well, the other day,
I was in the basement...\\
201 - Was Michael there?\\
202 - Yes, anyways...\\
203 - He is such a jerk.\\
204 - Yes, anyways, back
to my amusing anecdote.\\
205 - Well, the other day,
I was tying my shoe...\\
206 - Mmm, ask first!\\
207 - Fez, I am so glad I
came out with you tonight.\\
208 - Really?\\
209 - I was starving.\\
210 - So, what happened?\\
211 - Did you kiss her?\\
212 - 'Cause I'll kill you
if you kissed her.\\
213 - Oh, no, I didn't
want to kiss her.\\
214 - I wanted to give her a napkin.\\
215 - There was not a moment
when she did not have\\
216 - a face full of food.\\
217 - I was disgusted.\\
218 - Really?\\
219 - Hey, all is forgiven, buddy.\\
220 - Okay, fine, Hyde.\\
221 - You don't want to tell me
what Laurie said about me?\\
222 - I'm fine with that.\\
223 - I'm telling you, man.
She didn't say anything.\\
224 - Uh-huh.\\
225 - Right.\\
226 - Because, I mean, that's
what Laurie's known for.\\
227 - Not saying bitchy things.\\
228 - Hey, Hyde. What did
Laurie say about Eric?\\
229 - I'll tell you later,
man. It's so bad.\\
230 - Funny, but bad.\\
231 - Okay, you got nothing.\\
232 - Huh? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I got nothing.\\
233 - Okay, fine.
I don't care.\\
234 - She told you about
summer camp, right?\\
235 - Fine.\\
236 - They called me
Dr. Pee-pee.\\
237 - I couldn't sleep on the top bunk\\
238 - and I was 10, so...\\
239 - You know, who cares,
I'm Dr. Pee-pee. I'm...\\
240 - Dr. Pee-pee.\\
241 - Dr. Pee-pee.\\
242 - You are so Dr. Pee-pee.\\
243 - Oh, really.\\
244 - Big Chief Brown Bottom.\\
245 - I'm sorry.
Sorry, man, sorry.\\
246 - Just...
Everyone shut up.\\
247 - Hey, how was dinner?\\
248 - Fine.\\
249 - Except your father wouldn't
shut up about that stupid necklace.\\
250 - Look, Kitty, obviously
something's going on here.\\
251 - So why don't you just
tell me what it is?\\
252 - Did you lose it?\\
253 - No.\\
254 - Did you lend it to somebody?\\
255 - No.\\
256 - Then what the hell happened?\\
257 - I hocked it, okay?\\
258 - I hocked it, I
pawned it, I hocked it.\\
259 - You pawned my dead
mother's necklace?\\
260 - Yes.\\
261 - And I'm not sorry 'cause
we got groceries for it.\\
262 - So, I'm not sorry.\\
263 - I'm not sorry,
and I don't feel bad.\\
264 - Oh, Eric, I feel so bad.\\
265 - Mom, you feel bad?\\
266 - Laurie told everyone
about Dr. Pee-pee.\\
267 - Oh, honey, that's not so bad.\\
268 - That's cute.\\
269 - Oh, please, I have told
that story to so many...\\
270 - Mom!\\
271 - I didn't tell that
story to anybody.\\
272 - So, then, after I finished
putting all my pictures of Michael\\
273 - in my special Michael box,\\
274 - I realized that I'm
so totally over him.\\
275 - You liar.\\
276 - Look at yourself.\\
277 - And if you keep stuffing your
face like this, you're gonna get...\\
278 - Don't you dare
say it, you bitch.\\
279 - Fat.\\
280 - No.\\
281 - No.\\
282 - Yep, I've almost
finished my fifth pie,\\
283 - and I'm still
completely over Michael.\\
284 - Don't.\\
285 - Stop.\\
286 - Wait.\\
287 - Mmm.\\
288 - Blueberry.\\
289 - Hmm.\\
290 - I'm feeling kind of weird.\\
291 - Oh, no, what's happening to me?\\
292 - Oh, my God.
Oh, goodness.\\
293 - Oh, gracious, oh, my!\\
294 - No more pie for you.\\
295 - Okay, let's go, Jackie.\\
296 - Suck it in, Jackie.\\
297 - Oh, my God, Donna, I'm scared.\\
298 - I have to control myself.\\
299 - Okay, well, then let's start by
you handing Donna the jerky.\\
300 - Back off, you Amazon.\\
301 - Look, I just need more time.\\
302 - Okay, you slapping my hand\\
303 - when I tried to take your jerky\\
304 - is something
a fat girl would do.\\
305 - Okay, Laurie? I know
what you told Hyde.\\
306 - What are you talking
about, loser?\\
307 - The camp story,
Dr. Pee-pee. You're dead.\\
308 - What's going on?\\
309 - Shh, pretend it's TV. Okay.\\
310 - Well, I know some
pretty horrible things\\
311 - about you, too, little lady.\\
312 - Fellas...\\
313 - Laurie here waxes
her lips, legs, eyebrows,\\
314 - toes, and shoulder blades.\\
315 - In the fifth grade,\\
316 - Eric sent away for
the Charles Atlas kit\\
317 - 'cause a girl kicked
sand in his face.\\
318 - You stuffed in high
school. So did you.\\
319 - Last year, Laurie used
all of her birthday money\\
320 - to buy a back massager.\\
321 - Which isn't fooling
anyone, by the way.\\
322 - Well...\\
323 - That's not as bad as
when I walked in on you\\
324 - in bed with your Dorothy
Hamill poster, and you were all...\\
325 - Laurie was born with a tail!\\
326 - What?\\
327 - Yeah, Laurie
was born with a tail.\\
328 - I hate you!\\
329 - It's true.\\
330 - Okay, Red.\\
331 - I'm very sorry
I pawned that necklace.\\
332 - That's okay.\\
333 - I've been thinking about it,
and it's no big deal.\\
334 - Let's just let
bygones be bygones.\\
335 - What do you say, pretty lady?\\
336 - What did you do?\\
337 - A few months ago, I pawned the
pocket watch your dad gave me.\\
338 - So we're even.\\
339 - Let's just get on
with our lives.\\
340 - Oh, Red, how could you?\\
341 - Well, Kitty...\\
342 - Who the hell needs
a damn pocket watch?\\
343 - "What time is it?"\\
344 - "I don't know.
I'll check my pocket."\\
345 - See what I mean?
That's just stupid.\\
346 - Oh, Red.\\
347 - And I pawned the lawn mower
and Eric's old phonograph player\\
348 - and the snow blower.\\
349 - We had a snow blower?\\
350 - Actually, it was Bob's.\\
351 - Well, why'd you get
so mad at me?\\
352 - I got mad at myself.\\
353 - Look, it's the man's job
to support the family.\\
354 - And if he can't do that,
it's the man's job\\
355 - to pawn the things to feed
the family that he can't support!\\
356 - Okay.\\
357 - Okay.\\
358 - You know, Bob's been
looking for that snow blower.\\
359 - Yeah, I know, Kitty.\\
360 - And believe you me...\\
361 - I'm running out of stories.\\
362 - So, what you're saying is
I slept with the devil?\\
363 - Exactly.\\
364 - She told me it was a birthmark.\\
365 - It is a birthmark.\\
366 - From where they cut off
her tail at birth.\\
367 - Guys, I'm actually starting
to feel a little bad about this.\\
368 - Yeah. It is not right to
reveal other people's secrets.\\
369 - I'm going to have to agree
with Dr. Pee-pee on this one.\\
370 - Hello, boys.\\
371 - And how are you, Michael?\\
372 - Well, not so good.\\
373 - I just got some very
disturbing news.\\
374 - Well, I hope
you're very unhappy.\\
375 - Fez, can I talk to you?\\
376 - Yes.\\
377 - Okay, Fez, I just want
to thank you for last night.\\
378 - I know I wasn't
my super cute self.\\
379 - And I'm sorry.\\
380 - But you're a really good friend.\\
381 - But, Jackie, I was hoping that
perhaps we could be more than friends.\\
382 - Well, hope springs eternal, Fez.\\
383 - How about you just keep
worshipping me from afar,\\
384 - and stay available?\\
385 - Just in case.\\
386 - You would do that for me?\\
387 - That's a sweet deal.\\
388 - Should we kiss on it?\\
389 - Sure.\\
390 - Bye.\\
391 - All right, that's it.
You're dead!\\
392 - Hiya!\\
393 - Sweet dreams,
Dr. Pee-pee.\\
394 - Oh, yeah.
\subsection {Episode 23: Holy Crap!}
1 - Hey, Mom, are you
gonna wear that to church,\\
2 - or is it just laundry day?\\
3 - Think about it.\\
4 - No. There's an emergency
at the hospital,\\
5 - and they're really
short-staffed.\\
6 - I'm sorry I'm not gonna
make it to church today.\\
7 - All right!
No church!\\
8 - Hey, we can watch
the Brewers game.\\
9 - Sounds great!\\
10 - Laurie will cook us up
a couple of hot dogs...\\
11 - No, no Brewers, no
hot dogs, no nice day.\\
12 - You're gonna make sure
these kids get to church.\\
13 - Why do we have to go?\\
14 - Well, I have a million
reasons and no time.\\
15 - Now, here's a dollar
for the offering.\\
16 - And you remember, you
sing loud, you sing proud.\\
17 - Hey, how about you? How
come you never have to go?\\
18 - Eric,\\
19 - God and I had a heart to heart,\\
20 - while I watched my destroyer
go down in the South Pacific.\\
21 - We're real good.\\
22 - You're not.\\
23 - Go.
Okay.\\
24 - Well, I'll see ya.\\
25 - I'm gonna go meet some
friends behind the bowling alley.\\
26 - Laurie, we're supposed
to go to church.\\
27 - Oh, we're supposed
to go to church.\\
28 - Stop being such a little girl
and do something bad for once.\\
29 - Hanging out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all, all right\\
36 - We're all, all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - So, Eric, I see you're
not in church today.\\
39 - Uh, no. Now that I'm not
a virgin anymore,\\
40 - there's really nothing left
to pray for.\\
41 - Man, my life sucks.\\
42 - Ever since Jackie left,
I'm no good at pinball.\\
43 - You were never good at pinball.\\
44 - Let's look at the bright side
of not having Jackie.\\
45 - First, no Jackie.\\
46 - Second, now you can do
all the things\\
47 - that you could never do
when you were with her, man.\\
48 - Which was at last count...\\
49 - Everything.\\
50 - Oh, man.
You're right.\\
51 - You know, Jackie never
ever wanted me to, like,\\
52 - cheat on her, or grow a beard,\\
53 - and I always wanted to.\\
54 - And now I can let this grow out!\\
55 - May I grow one, too?\\
56 - I don't know, Fez. The two of
us growing beards together...\\
57 - Isn't that kind of girlie?\\
58 - Hmm, well, I just figure
the more the hairier.\\
59 - Oh, I'm surrounded by idiots.\\
60 - Hey, you know what might make
our little church ploy work better?\\
61 - If you'd button your shirt.\\
62 - Oh, and, uh, hey,
what's that in your hair?\\
63 - Oh, a cigarette butt.
That's nice.\\
64 - Ugh. That's the last time
I make out on asphalt.\\
65 - Ah, there they are.\\
66 - My little angels are home.\\
67 - How was church, good sermon?\\
68 - You know, fine.\\
69 - Jesus said something
really wise.\\
70 - People said,
"Oh, that Jesus."\\
71 - And now we go and try
and live our lives that way.\\
72 - You mean, like a couple of,
uh, big, fat liars?\\
73 - Yeah. I ran into Bob
out in the driveway,\\
74 - and he told me you
weren't at church.\\
75 - God! I hate Bob!\\
76 - I tried to go, Daddy, but
Eric wouldn't give me a ride.\\
77 - Hey, Mary Magdalene,
there's some gum on your neck.\\
78 - I can't believe that my own
children would do this.\\
79 - Mom, I mean, it's
such a nice day.\\
80 - And we wanted to get
some of that fresh air\\
81 - you're always telling us about.\\
82 - Hey. Nobody likes
a smart-mouth sinner.\\
83 - You know, this
wouldn't have happened\\
84 - if someone had made sure his
children had gotten to church.\\
85 - Well, l...\\
86 - Damn!\\
87 - All right, from now on,
you kids are going to church.\\
88 - That's an order.\\
89 - Oh, Dad...\\
90 - Okay, okay, you know what.\\
91 - We shouldn't have to force them.\\
92 - They're almost grown up.\\
93 - They can make up
their own minds.\\
94 - Really?\\
95 - Sure.\\
96 - If you want to turn
your backs on God\\
97 - and spend eternity doing
laps in a lake of fire,\\
98 - well, that's your choice!\\
99 - So guys.\\
100 - Well, what do you think
of the beard?\\
101 - Yes, it's not bad
after one week, huh?\\
102 - I think it's stupid.\\
103 - You look like a hobo.\\
104 - Well, you're crazy.\\
105 - Well, you look like a hobo.\\
106 - Crazy!
Hobo!\\
107 - Yeah, well, I like it.
I think it looks rugged.\\
108 - Look how thick it's coming in.\\
109 - Hello.\\
110 - Wow, Fez, that's a nice beard.\\
111 - It will be, once it
really comes in.\\
112 - Doesn't Michael look stupid?\\
113 - I mean, it's not
even growing in right.\\
114 - It's all patchy.\\
115 - Ha ha.
Poor Patchy.\\
116 - All right, I don't
have to take this.\\
117 - Oh. Now we made
Patchy upset.\\
118 - Bye, Patchy.
So long, Patchy.\\
119 - I miss Patchy.\\
120 - Doesn't Michael look
hot with that beard?\\
121 - I mean, it's all
rough and forbidden.\\
122 - I thought you said
Kelso looked stupid.\\
123 - Well, I can't
tell him I like it.\\
124 - I hate his guts!\\
125 - But I hate him even
more now that he's so hot.\\
126 - That hot bearded jerk.\\
127 - What about my beard?\\
128 - It has egg in it.\\
129 - Laurie, what are you doing?\\
130 - Church starts in 10 minutes.\\
131 - Mom, I'm not going!\\
132 - What?\\
133 - Well, Eric's not going either.\\
134 - Oh, of course he is.\\
135 - Well, no, ah, I thought...\\
136 - Mom, I thought you
said we had the choice.\\
137 - Uh-huh.\\
138 - And I chose no.\\
139 - But, uh, yes was a close second.\\
140 - You know, I don't
understand this at all.\\
141 - You give me one good reason
why you don't want to go to church.\\
142 - It's hot.
It's boring.\\
143 - The music sucks.
The pastor's ugly.\\
144 - I have to wear a tie.
I have to wear a bra.\\
145 - Enough.\\
146 - What about Hyde? I
mean, he doesn't have to go.\\
147 - While I respect
the Judeo-Christian ethic,\\
148 - as well as the Eastern
philosophies\\
149 - and, of course,
the teachings of Muhammad,\\
150 - I find that organized religions
have corrupted those beliefs\\
151 - to justify countless
atrocities throughout history.\\
152 - Were I to attend church,
I'd be a hypocrite.\\
153 - Okay, you know what?\\
154 - I am leaving in five minutes.\\
155 - And I'm sure you will make
the right decision.\\
156 - No. You'll make
the right decision.\\
157 - And you drag her with you.\\
158 - Something tells me I will not
be sitting in that pew alone.\\
159 - Hey, Kitty, the
Pinciottis are all here.\\
160 - Where's the rest of team Forman?\\
161 - Oh, I'm all alone today.\\
162 - All alone?\\
163 - Ick! That's just
embarrassing.\\
164 - Well, that's a shame.\\
165 - Because if there's anyone
who has some confessing to do,\\
166 - it's that dirty,
dirty son of yours.\\
167 - Excuse me, ma'am.\\
168 - Is this seat taken, ma'am?\\
169 - Do you see anyone?\\
170 - I love it here, man.\\
171 - The guy up there tells stories,\\
172 - that guy wails on the organ,\\
173 - you can sing as loud
as you want.\\
174 - It's almost a religious
experience, man.\\
175 - I kind of think this is what
heaven's gonna be like, you know.\\
176 - Plus they'll have an open bar.\\
177 - Right this way.\\
178 - Wipe your feet, please.\\
179 - Sorry, no flash photography.\\
180 - Next.
Oh, that's us.\\
181 - Forman, party of four.\\
182 - I'm sorry, I can't let you in.\\
183 - What?\\
184 - All of us or...\\
185 - Just Laurie?\\
186 - All of you.\\
187 - Hi, Laurie.\\
188 - Kitty, if you'd only gone
to church with your family,\\
189 - but you didn't.\\
190 - So, down you go.\\
191 - Haha!
I love that gag.\\
192 - Step aside, would you please?\\
193 - Next.\\
194 - Hey there, ho there.
Hi there, coming through.\\
195 - Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.\\
196 - What can I do?\\
197 - They went to church.\\
198 - Here's 20. Can you
find us a place up front?\\
199 - All right, that's it.\\
200 - I'm kicking Bob's ass.
Red!\\
201 - Well, Kitty, we're
going to hell anyway.\\
202 - Well, that's just
not gonna happen.\\
203 - Thanks, man.\\
204 - How was church?\\
205 - Great!\\
206 - I figured out what to do
with our sinner children.\\
207 - Kitty, our kids are fine.\\
208 - Oh, really?\\
209 - So, why is Laurie...\\
210 - Hey, hey.\\
211 - If we're gonna start
taking shots at our kids,\\
212 - let's focus on Eric.\\
213 - Okay, see, now,
that's the point.\\
214 - He needs to learn
right from wrong.\\
215 - I don't want him turning bad.\\
216 - Oh, Kitty. I don't think
Eric's gonna turn bad.\\
217 - He's too much of a panty-waist.\\
218 - I know why you're
defending them, Red.\\
219 - You feel guilty because
you set a bad example.\\
220 - Hey, I go to church.\\
221 - Just not during televised
sporting events.\\
222 - You know, Kitty,\\
223 - when my destroyer went down
in the South Pacific...\\
224 - Oh, blah, blah, blah.\\
225 - Fine. If I thought the kids
weren't going because of me,\\
226 - I'd go.\\
227 - Fortunately I don't think
that, so I'm not going.\\
228 - Well, that's all
well and good, Red,\\
229 - but since they
won't go to church,\\
230 - I'm bringing the church to them.\\
231 - I've asked Dave, the
church's youth minister,\\
232 - to come here for dinner,
and he said, "Groovy."\\
233 - Sounds like a great idea.\\
234 - You really think so?\\
235 - I don't have to be
there, right? No.\\
236 - Sounds like a great idea.\\
237 - You should really go
to church, Eric.\\
238 - 'Cause God, he sees everything.\\
239 - It's why I live my life
good and pure.\\
240 - Kelso, you were dating
two girls at the same time.\\
241 - Yeah, but God didn't see that.\\
242 - I was in my van, and he
can't see through lead.\\
243 - I don't want to get into
a religious argument,\\
244 - but my God can kick
your God's ass.\\
245 - God is dead, man.\\
246 - It said so in Time magazine.\\
247 - No, man.\\
248 - I sat next to God once
on the bus.\\
249 - He told me the meaning of life\\
250 - and then he gave me a pretzel.\\
251 - So what's the meaning
of life, man?\\
252 - Uh, yeah. I guess
I should have written it down.\\
253 - But it was a good pretzel, man.\\
254 - Maybe this life doesn't
even matter, you know.\\
255 - Maybe we're not even here.\\
256 - Or no. Maybe I'm here,
but you're not.\\
257 - Hello?\\
258 - You know what the best
thing God ever did was?\\
259 - Boobs!\\
260 - Yes. And God said,
"Let there be boobs."\\
261 - And then there were boobs.\\
262 - Hey, if God is all-powerful,\\
263 - can he make a boob so big
that even he can't lift it?\\
264 - Well, that's
a good question, man.\\
265 - I'll ask him next time
I'm on the bus.\\
266 - Oh, my God!
Here comes Michael.\\
267 - Isn't he gorgeous?\\
268 - Jackie, he's a dog that lied
and cheated on you, remember?\\
269 - Good! Good! Keep
saying stuff like that\\
270 - so that I don't throw
myself at him.\\
271 - Gee, I'll try.\\
272 - Oh, hey.\\
273 - Excuse me.\\
274 - Hey, Michael.\\
275 - You submental two-timing dog.\\
276 - Hey, Jackie.\\
277 - So where you off to?\\
278 - You lying, cheating
dirtbag jerk.\\
279 - Well, I'm just gonna
go over to the hub,\\
280 - grow my beard, you know.\\
281 - Well, that's neat.\\
282 - So, they allow scumwads in
there who lie to their girlfriends\\
283 - and cheat on them
and break their hearts?\\
284 - Uh, I guess so.
Yeah.\\
285 - Now, I know some
of the kids today\\
286 - think that God's a real downer,\\
287 - but the truth is, he's an upper.\\
288 - And let me tell you something,\\
289 - there's a much better drug
than LSD or PCP.\\
290 - I get high on G-O-D.\\
291 - Virgin.\\
292 - Bless you.\\
293 - Okay, why am I here?\\
294 - Because you're a young soul
in my care. Now sit, dammit.\\
295 - Sorry, Dave.\\
296 - I have a soft spot for virgins.\\
297 - 'Cause they're such a challenge.\\
298 - Religion can be cool.\\
299 - In fact, Jesus was a lot\\
300 - like another famous rebel.\\
301 - Fonzie.\\
302 - But where Fonzie says, "Ay,"\\
303 - Jesus says,
"Ay-men."\\
304 - But, Dave, could Jesus start
a jukebox just by hitting it?\\
305 - He could, but Jesus
doesn't like to hit anything.\\
306 - Did he ever waterski
over a shark?\\
307 - Okay, does anyone have
a question about the Bible?\\
308 - I do.\\
309 - Do you have your own place?\\
310 - Hey, you know what?\\
311 - How 'bout we stop talking
and we start singing songs?\\
312 - Jesus is just all right
with me\\
313 - Jesus is just all right
With me\\
314 - Everyone!\\
315 - Jesus Is just
all right With me Us!\\
316 - Jesus is just all right
Oh yeah\\
317 - Jesus is just all right
With me\\
318 - Jesus is just all right
With me\\
319 - Okay, let's take a look
at your pictures.\\
320 - Kitty, what do you see
when you think of God?\\
321 - Oh, that's nice.\\
322 - Very lifelike.\\
323 - See, he's, um, looking down
fondly on all of us going to church.\\
324 - Steven?\\
325 - Very good.\\
326 - I see. When you think of God,
you see Jesus.\\
327 - No, man.
It's Clapton.\\
328 - Oh, my God, man.\\
329 - I drew Clapton, too.\\
330 - Okay, cool.\\
331 - Laurie?\\
332 - I drew a special picture
just for you.\\
333 - Look at it later,
when you're alone.\\
334 - I got a pair of 10s.\\
335 - Or as we say in religious rummy,\\
336 - a pair of apostles.\\
337 - Ooh, um, I have a jack,
a queen, and a king.\\
338 - You mean a Joseph,
a Mary, and a Jesus.\\
339 - Wow! That's gonna be
hard to beat.\\
340 - That's so true, Kitty.\\
341 - Let's see what Laurie's got.\\
342 - Six...\\
343 - Six...\\
344 - Six.\\
345 - Well, thank you all
for the lovely evening.\\
346 - I'll see you at the church.\\
347 - Oh, Michael.\\
348 - Oh, Michael!\\
349 - Mom!\\
350 - Eric, Laurie, get
ready for church.\\
351 - Wait a second. I thought
you said it was our choice.\\
352 - Well, when you choose
to go, it'll be your choice.\\
353 - Coming on to the youth
minister? You need church.\\
354 - Mom, why are you doing this?\\
355 - I don't have to have a reason.\\
356 - It's right, I'm your
mother, now move.\\
357 - But it's not fair.\\
358 - I mean, why do we
have to go to church?\\
359 - I mean...\\
360 - Dad doesn't go.\\
361 - Aha!\\
362 - Aha, aha, aha, aha!\\
363 - Come on, everybody, the
Formans are going to church!\\
364 - You had to throw me under
the bus with you, didn't ya?\\
365 - Well, nice going, Eric.\\
366 - Yeah. Nice going.\\
367 - Now I have to put on a bra.\\
368 - God hates me.\\
369 - Oh, dear lord\\
370 - Three things I pray\\
371 - Pray
A!\\
372 - To see thee more clearly\\
373 - To see thee more
B!\\
374 - Love thee more nearly\\
375 - C!\\
376 - Follow thee more nearly\\
377 - Day by day\\
378 - Day by day\\
379 - Day By Day
Day by day\\
380 - Day By Day\\
381 - Day by, day by,
day by day\\
382 - Day by, day by,
day by day\\
383 - Day by day
\subsection {Episode 24: Red Fired Up}
1 - How many licks does it take\\
2 - to get to the Tootsie Roll
center of a Tootsie Pop?\\
3 - One.\\
4 - Two.\\
5 - Ah, screw it.\\
6 - Ow, my tooth.\\
7 - Why did I bite?\\
8 - Eric, if you don't want to
wear your ass for a hat,\\
9 - you'll get up here, pronto.\\
10 - You'd better go.
You know how that ass-hat\\
11 - screws up your hair.\\
12 - Poor Forman, huh?
Working for Red like that?\\
13 - I wouldn't wish that
on my enemies.\\
14 - I would.\\
15 - Those suckers must pay.\\
16 - Hey, Jackie.\\
17 - Michael, why don't you
save the sweet stuff\\
18 - for the next idiot who's
dumb enough to date you?\\
19 - You know, Jackie,\\
20 - if you're in the market
for a new lover,\\
21 - they say once you go Fez,
you never go back.\\
22 - In my language, that rhymes.\\
23 - Okay.\\
24 - Where's Donna?\\
25 - She's upstairs with Forman.\\
26 - And don't follow me, Michael.\\
27 - We've broken up, and I mean it!\\
28 - Oh, I wasn't.\\
29 - It's a good thing we're
broken up, because...\\
30 - Damn it.
I miss her.\\
31 - Jeez, man.
Who wouldn't?\\
32 - Spare me the sarcasm, Hyde.\\
33 - I am really hurting here,\\
34 - and I'm totally lonely.\\
35 - Man, I've seen people gut-shot\\
36 - who complain less than you.\\
37 - Okay, so what do you
miss about her?\\
38 - All she ever did
was call you names.\\
39 - Hey, I can do that for you.\\
40 - You idiot. See?\\
41 - Oh. Thanks, Fez.\\
42 - No problem, fart-face.\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - We're all, all right\\
50 - We're all, all right\\
51 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
52 - Do you know the great
thing about whistling?\\
53 - You can stop whistling.\\
54 - Sorry.\\
55 - Eric, bend your knees
and lift with your legs,\\
56 - or else, I'm gonna...\\
57 - Kick my ass,
put your foot in my ass,\\
58 - make my ass a hat.\\
59 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\
60 - Jeez. And I didn't think
you were listening.\\
61 - Oh, and I need you to
re-sticker those clock radios.\\
62 - They're on sale.\\
63 - Yeah, I saw the flyer. I
already took care of it.\\
64 - Really? Well...\\
65 - Way to show initiative.\\
66 - Way to show initiative?\\
67 - What are you up to?\\
68 - Nothing. I think
you did a good job.\\
69 - Okay,\\
70 - but I'm watching you.\\
71 - Hey, guys.\\
72 - Sorry I'm late, Red.\\
73 - My dog got hit by a car.\\
74 - I had to rush him to the vet.\\
75 - Earl.\\
76 - Your dog got hit
on Tuesday, too.\\
77 - How dumb is that dog?\\
78 - Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry, Red.\\
79 - I know you gave me a break\\
80 - 'cause we worked
at the plant together,\\
81 - and I appreciate it. I
swear it's the last time.\\
82 - Earl, why can't you
be more like Eric?\\
83 - I mean, he's 18, and he's...\\
84 - Dad, I'm, uh, I'm 17.\\
85 - Eric.
I'm talking here.\\
86 - And he's already got a
better work ethic than you.\\
87 - Oh, no doubt there, Red.\\
88 - You can tell he's your son.\\
89 - He's a super...\\
90 - - Earl.
- Mmm?\\
91 - Let's just go to work, okay?\\
92 - Sure. Right after
a cup of joe.\\
93 - I'm useless without my coffee.\\
94 - Wow.\\
95 - He must not have had
coffee in years, huh?\\
96 - That's pretty funny.\\
97 - Okay, what's up with you?\\
98 - Hey, Kelso.
How's it going?\\
99 - How's it going?
Great.\\
100 - Just 'cause a guy
shoots hoops by himself\\
101 - doesn't mean he's lonely.\\
102 - No, far from it.\\
103 - Okay, that's good.\\
104 - Hey, Donna?
Um...\\
105 - You know, all this talk
about being lonely\\
106 - kind of reminds me
of me, you know?\\
107 - Kelso, are you gonna
get all emotional?\\
108 - 'Cause just 'cause I'm a girl\\
109 - doesn't mean I won't
totally make fun of you.\\
110 - Fair enough.
Okay.\\
111 - I know I keep things bottled up,\\
112 - but, you know, underneath
this cool exterior,\\
113 - there's a really sad
human being.\\
114 - My God. This is
about Jackie.\\
115 - Yes. All right.
What gave it away?\\
116 - The fact that it's all you ever
talk about, you stupid dillhole.\\
117 - Look, Kelso, you've got
to get it through your head.\\
118 - Jackie is not
coming back to you.\\
119 - Why?\\
120 - Because you slept
with someone else!\\
121 - Yeah, like,
a month ago. God!\\
122 - I just realized Jackie's short.\\
123 - And I don't like short people.\\
124 - They're creepy, you know?\\
125 - Always sneaking up on you.\\
126 - I don't even know why
I was with her.\\
127 - Maybe it's because
she's a tiny little whore.\\
128 - Oh. I meant
to hurt you,\\
129 - but I hurt myself
because I love her.\\
130 - Hey, guys. I really
cracked Red up today,\\
131 - and not by tripping or
getting wet or vomiting.\\
132 - Did you bump your head?\\
133 - That's good stuff.\\
134 - No, I just made a joke,
and he just got it.\\
135 - I mean, it worked.
We're like just two guys\\
136 - brought together
by the common goal\\
137 - of slashing prices
on all your household needs.\\
138 - Plus, I mean, it is so great\\
139 - to see him chew out
other people.\\
140 - Yeah, Forman.
Now you know\\
141 - how we feel when
he yells at you.\\
142 - Yeah. It really
is hilarious, man.\\
143 - You get all bug-eyed
and stuttery.\\
144 - Fellas,\\
145 - I've been thinking.\\
146 - There's a lot of ladies
out there, right?\\
147 - Now, I haven't seen nearly
enough of them naked.\\
148 - Sometimes, I am looking
at naked ladies,\\
149 - and then I get exhausted.\\
150 - And then, I get a second wind,\\
151 - and then I'm ready
for more naked ladies.\\
152 - It's like, at work,
there's this guy Earl,\\
153 - and he's a real screwup, right?\\
154 - So, Red gets pretty PO'd,\\
155 - but that deflects
all of Red's anger from me.\\
156 - So, I mean, Earl's like\\
157 - a dumb-ass lightning rod.\\
158 - I hear that, man.
Yeah.\\
159 - I'll only work with
the barely competent.\\
160 - It takes the stress
out of slacking off.\\
161 - Man, it feels great to
be free of that midget.\\
162 - Yeah, uh, it's like
the world is my oyster,\\
163 - and I'm ready to shuck it.\\
164 - Nothing but hot new
ladies from here on in.\\
165 - I want to be boldly going\\
166 - where no man's gone before.\\
167 - Hello, Mrs. Forman. I'm
here to pick up Laurie.\\
168 - No, no, no.\\
169 - You mean Eric.\\
170 - No, uh, Laurie.
Your other kid.\\
171 - But why?\\
172 - You're dating Laurie?\\
173 - That's not different, man.\\
174 - You're boldly going where
every man's gone before.\\
175 - Steven, it is not nice\\
176 - to be so...\\
177 - Truthful.\\
178 - Hi, Kelso.\\
179 - Did you buy me those?\\
180 - Yeah, just like you told me.\\
181 - No. I told you roses.\\
182 - Come on, doofus.\\
183 - No offense,
Mrs. Forman, but,\\
184 - those two could make
the dumbest babies ever.\\
185 - That's not funny.\\
186 - Speaking of work.\\
187 - We weren't talking about work.\\
188 - Work. Right.\\
189 - Dad and I really put in
some hard hours today.\\
190 - Didn't we, Pop?\\
191 - Eric's really busting
his hump down there.\\
192 - Well, I am just so happy\\
193 - my two fellas work
so well together.\\
194 - Hey, how's Earl doing?\\
195 - Oh, he's okay.
But his damn dog\\
196 - can't go a day
without getting hit.\\
197 - At least I've got
one good man down there.\\
198 - Right back at you, big guy.\\
199 - Well, that Earl's
always been a character.\\
200 - Yeah, like today, he was late,\\
201 - and dad said, "Get to work,"\\
202 - and he said, "Sorry, Red,\\
203 - "I'm useless
without my coffee."\\
204 - And then, I said,\\
205 - "He must not have had
coffee in years," right?\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - Well, that's cute.\\
208 - Yeah, and that's not
even my best Earl joke.\\
209 - Okay, ready? Knock,
knock. Who's there?\\
210 - Well, it's not Earl,
'cause he's late.\\
211 - Yeah, I'm guessing
Earl's not short for early.\\
212 - That's a good one, Red.\\
213 - I got one.
Um...\\
214 - There once was a girl
from Nantucket...\\
215 - Okay, okay.
Let's just all eat.\\
216 - Hey, uh, Laurie?\\
217 - Yeah, could you, uh...\\
218 - Get out!\\
219 - Thanks.\\
220 - Come on, Kelso.
Come up to my room.\\
221 - I need you to, um,
help me move my bookcase.\\
222 - That means we're gonna have sex.\\
223 - Thanks for cracking that code.\\
224 - What are you doing?\\
225 - They're going up to have sex.\\
226 - Get the wax out of your ears.\\
227 - Man, you can't bring my sister\\
228 - down to the basement.\\
229 - This is our fortress
of solitude.\\
230 - Well, I'm sorry, but she's
my girlfriend, and I love her.\\
231 - No, you don't.\\
232 - Well, I like her.\\
233 - No, you don't.\\
234 - I think she is okay,\\
235 - and the line between
love and okay is pretty fine.\\
236 - But the line between
doing it and not doing it,\\
237 - that's not fine at all.\\
238 - Just like the line
between moron and idiot?\\
239 - Exactly. You know,
it took me months\\
240 - to get Jackie in the sack.\\
241 - Well, Laurie, she
already lets me do it,\\
242 - and plus, I'm over here\\
243 - all the time, anyway,\\
244 - so there's like,
the convenience factor.\\
245 - Kelso, my bookcase
isn't going to move itself.\\
246 - Or maybe it will.\\
247 - Damn, I gotta go.\\
248 - Dumbest babies ever.\\
249 - Jackie, it's great
to see you so happy.\\
250 - And strong.
And over Kelso.\\
251 - You're like a rock.
You're like a tiny little rock.\\
252 - Donna, are you trying
to tell me bad news,\\
253 - or are you making fun
of my butt?\\
254 - No. Your butt's fine.\\
255 - Fine?\\
256 - Glorious.
Whatever. Look.\\
257 - Kelso's dating Laurie.\\
258 - I don't care.\\
259 - Oh, come on.\\
260 - How can you still have
feelings for him?\\
261 - Donna, I don't have
feelings for him.\\
262 - I just hate that bitch
for making him happy.\\
263 - Oh, believe me.
She will make him\\
264 - more miserable
than you ever did.\\
265 - Oh, Donna. Thank you.\\
266 - I'm gonna pray to God
that you're right.\\
267 - Laurie, I have to talk to you.\\
268 - Kelso, we gotta confab, man.\\
269 - Okay.\\
270 - Too many times
I have sat idly by\\
271 - and watched you
make bad choices.\\
272 - I've seen you screw up
an awful lot.\\
273 - And sure, I've enjoyed it.\\
274 - But now,
you've gone too far.\\
275 - Do you know what this is about?\\
276 - Duh. I'm not an idiot.\\
277 - Uh-uh.\\
278 - Michael has some
nice qualities, but...\\
279 - Laurie's got great legs,\\
280 - and a fine rack, but...\\
281 - He's just a boy.\\
282 - She's a major skankoid.\\
283 - And you don't know where a boy
like that will end up.\\
284 - And you don't know where
a girl like that has been.\\
285 - Now, I know. I know
you want a boyfriend\\
286 - who's weak
and easily manipulated.\\
287 - Now, I know you're weak\\
288 - and easily manipulated.\\
289 - But you have got to learn\\
290 - to think about the future.\\
291 - But you've got
to learn to think.\\
292 - And...\\
293 - And make
smart choices.\\
294 - 'Cause what's convenient isn't
always what's best.\\
295 - If it were,
I'd just throw on a muumuu\\
296 - and eat out of a can.\\
297 - If it were, this frozen pizza\\
298 - wouldn't taste like monkey butt.\\
299 - Okay.\\
300 - Are you done with
this little lecture?\\
301 - Okay. You done
with that pizza?\\
302 - Yes.\\
303 - And I think I've made my point.\\
304 - Oh, god.\\
305 - I've got to get my own place.\\
306 - This doesn't taste
like monkey butt.\\
307 - Oh, jeez, Red. I'm sorry
I'm late for our little meeting.\\
308 - My, uh, dog got,\\
309 - car got hit by a...\\
310 - Car. Accident.
That's the word.\\
311 - Eric, take your break
anywhere but here.\\
312 - Earl,\\
313 - you're fired.\\
314 - What? What did I do?\\
315 - What did you do?\\
316 - I'll tell you
what you did.\\
317 - And another thing.\\
318 - Hi. How was your day?\\
319 - I had to let Earl go.\\
320 - Let Earl go?\\
321 - You yelled at him
until he cried.\\
322 - Hey. What kind
of a man cries\\
323 - after only 15 minutes
of yelling?\\
324 - Well, I'm sorry.\\
325 - I don't like the way
you handled Earl.\\
326 - Dad, he was your friend.\\
327 - Eric, hush, hush, hush, hush.\\
328 - Eric, work is work.\\
329 - You don't show up late,
you don't make excuses,\\
330 - and you don't not work.\\
331 - If it wasn't work,
they wouldn't call it work.\\
332 - They'd call it superwonderful
crazy-fun time.\\
333 - Or skippity-doo.\\
334 - Oh, jeez. Why the hell
am I even talking to you?\\
335 - Oh, Eric.\\
336 - Why'd you have to go
and upset your father?\\
337 - I can't have my own opinion\\
338 - without him tearing my head off?\\
339 - No.\\
340 - And I think at your age,
you should know that by now.\\
341 - No, mom, no.
Uh-uh.\\
342 - Man, we had such a
good thing going at work,\\
343 - and he just wrecked that.\\
344 - And by the way, without Earl,\\
345 - I'm back to dumb-ass.\\
346 - He's just mean.\\
347 - Oh, you shut
your porky mouth, mister.\\
348 - Well, then, it just stinks\\
349 - because, you know what?\\
350 - This is the first time\\
351 - we were ever like, you
know, cool with each other.\\
352 - Man, why does he have to
be such a hard-ass all the time?\\
353 - Oh, come on, Eric.\\
354 - That's how he expresses himself.\\
355 - That's how he's always
expressed himself.\\
356 - Your father yells at you
because he cares.\\
357 - Yeah, right. Well,
if that's true, then...\\
358 - Then...\\
359 - Stand up straight.\\
360 - You're a dumb-ass.\\
361 - You call this a report card?\\
362 - Hands above the covers.\\
363 - Huh.\\
364 - I guess he really, really cares.\\
365 - And...\\
366 - If not, you're moving out soon.\\
367 - So. You know
who I hate?\\
368 - Laurie.\\
369 - Oh, Jackie.
I know you're upset\\
370 - and in pain,\\
371 - but you're not going to talk\\
372 - during Hollywood
Squares, are you?\\
373 - No, I mean,
I really do hate her.\\
374 - No offense, Eric,
but your sister...\\
375 - She's a slut.\\
376 - Oh, my God.\\
377 - Jackie, not since
the Smokey vs. Bandit debate\\
378 - have you and I so been
on the same page.\\
379 - Yeah, I think
we're all on board.\\
380 - God, this is so great.\\
381 - You guys all hate
Laurie and love me.\\
382 - Yeah, we all hate Laurie.\\
383 - Shh!\\
384 - Oh great.\\
385 - Lamb Chop had a joke,
and I missed it.\\
386 - Hey, guys.\\
387 - Oh, hi, Michael.\\
388 - Kelso, as your new girlfriend,\\
389 - I'm really not comfortable
with your old girlfriend\\
390 - hanging out down here.\\
391 - Okay.\\
392 - Uh, hey, Jackie, do you mind?\\
393 - No. No, I don't mind
if you leave.\\
394 - She's not leaving.\\
395 - Well, I'm not, either.\\
396 - She's not, either.\\
397 - Fine.\\
398 - Fine.\\
399 - Fine.\\
400 - Fine.\\
401 - Hey!
This is my house.\\
402 - So what?
Eric wants me here.\\
403 - Don't you, Eric?\\
404 - Why, yes, I do.\\
405 - You better watch your back.\\
406 - Really?\\
407 - 'Cause you should stop
spending so much time on yours.\\
408 - Oh. Burn!\\
409 - Hey, I'm sorry. I just got swept
away by the supergood burn.\\
410 - Shut up!\\
411 - Ah, ah, ah.\\
412 - Jackie?\\
413 - That was an excellent burn.\\
414 - Thank you, Fez.\\
415 - Now, please.
Sit next to Fez.\\
416 - Move it.\\
417 - What the hell were you doing\\
418 - in the shower so long?\\
419 - You know it wastes water,\\
420 - and it might make me late.\\
421 - In fact, I am definitely not\\
422 - gonna be the first person there.\\
423 - You know how that makes me look?\\
424 - Damn it. You've got to grow
up and learn some responsibility.\\
425 - I love you, too, Dad.\\
426 - What?\\
427 - Stop being weird.\\
428 - Thanks.
\subsection {Episode 25: Cat Fight Club}
1 - Ooh! Now I've got
Park Place and Boardwalk.\\
2 - This game's just like life.\\
3 - I am the richest of all.\\
4 - Jackie, I've got $970 here.\\
5 - It's all yours if you'll
just... Go away!\\
6 - Relax, Forman. It's better
than having Laurie down here.\\
7 - She's like
a big, cancerous tumor.\\
8 - And Jackie, you know,
she's like, uh...\\
9 - A tiny, benign cyst.\\
10 - Thank you, Hyde.\\
11 - Here. Buy yourself a hotel.\\
12 - Why are you giving him money?\\
13 - I'm the one in jail. Plus,
Hyde punched me in the arm.\\
14 - Why can't we start over?\\
15 - Because!\\
16 - And don't try tippin' over
the board again, either.\\
17 - Next time we go hiking,
make sure you bring a blanket.\\
18 - I think I have
a twig in my shorts.\\
19 - What a coincidence.
So does Kelso.\\
20 - Burn!\\
21 - Okay, okay. Nice burn.\\
22 - Hi, Jackie.\\
23 - Oh, look. It's Michael
and his community chest.\\
24 - Nice.\\
25 - So, Michael, when you
come over for dinner tonight,\\
26 - don't wear that
stupid unicorn tie.\\
27 - Oh, I'm sorry, Jackie.
Was that a gift?\\
28 - Oh, yeah?\\
29 - Well, were those shoes a gift?\\
30 - 'Cause they're ugly!\\
31 - What are you even
doing here, anyways?\\
32 - Shouldn't you be off playing
with ribbons and ponies?\\
33 - Well, shouldn't you be off...\\
34 - Being a bitch?\\
35 - Ooh, I made the little
girl say a bad word.\\
36 - See you tonight.\\
37 - Whoops.\\
38 - Hangin' out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - Laurie makes me so mad.\\
48 - I just want to rip out
her hair, show it to her,\\
49 - and hope it doesn't grow back.\\
50 - I hate her.\\
51 - Jackie, that's what she wants.\\
52 - She feeds on your anger, man.
It only makes her stronger.\\
53 - Well, then, what am
I supposed to do?\\
54 - If you really want
to get under her skin,\\
55 - you have to be Zen.\\
56 - Zen? Okay, you can't just
make up words, Hyde.\\
57 - No, man, Zen.\\
58 - At peace. Aloof.\\
59 - Zen.\\
60 - Oh.\\
61 - Okay, then...\\
62 - Hyde, will you teach me
how to be Zen?\\
63 - You can't just teach
someone to be Zen, Jackie.\\
64 - You can only learn to be Zen.\\
65 - Okay, I don't understand.\\
66 - Exactly.\\
67 - And that's your first lesson.\\
68 - Huh?\\
69 - Jackie, if you want
to be my student,\\
70 - you need to follow my
instructions without question.\\
71 - Okay. Okay. See?\\
72 - I can do that.\\
73 - Okay.\\
74 - First thing...\\
75 - Finish polishing my boots.\\
76 - Hyde, how's that
gonna help... What?\\
77 - Okay.\\
78 - You're gonna make
a fine student.\\
79 - Shine, grasshopper.
Shine.\\
80 - Kelso...\\
81 - Man, you're not seriously\\
82 - comin' to dinner
tonight, are you?\\
83 - Why shouldn't I? You know,
Jackie broke up with me,\\
84 - and I needed a
girlfriend, and Laurie's it.\\
85 - Plus, I need to eat,
so I'm comin' to dinner.\\
86 - God, Kelso, you're lame.\\
87 - And you're sad.\\
88 - But if you go
to dinner with Red,\\
89 - you're gonna get
your just desserts.\\
90 - I don't really care
what they serve.\\
91 - I just want to be there
for Laurie. You know?\\
92 - Hope it's pie.\\
93 - Oh, Kelso...\\
94 - It's gonna be so bad.\\
95 - Can I come to dinner tonight?\\
96 - No!\\
97 - Look. Red loves
Laurie. Right?\\
98 - And Laurie likes me.\\
99 - Therefore, Red has to like me.\\
100 - I mean, what father wouldn't like
the guy who's nailin' his daughter?\\
101 - Oh, Laurie, you can't
bring Michael to dinner.\\
102 - Are you out of your mind?\\
103 - Mom, I'm an adult,
and this is my choice.\\
104 - No. If you were
really an adult,\\
105 - you'd try to meet
someone with a future\\
106 - instead of Michael,
who, bless his heart,\\
107 - is probably gonna end up\\
108 - ripping tickets
at the tilt-a-whirl.\\
109 - Well, he could invent something.\\
110 - Yeah. I guess I'm lazy.\\
111 - Uh-huh. And, Laurie,
have you given any thought\\
112 - as to what you're gonna say to
your father when he finds out?\\
113 - He's my boyfriend, Daddy,
and we love each other,\\
114 - And you can't
stop us from being together!\\
115 - What do you think?\\
116 - Laurie, I absolutely forbid you\\
117 - to bring that boy to dinner.\\
118 - Oh! Sometimes
I hate you!\\
119 - Well... That
is just too bad,\\
120 - because I love you!\\
121 - Because I have to.\\
122 - Whatever!\\
123 - No. More aloofness.\\
124 - Whatever.\\
125 - I'm not believing you.\\
126 - Hyde, when are we
going to move on?\\
127 - I have been saying,
"Whatever," for half an hour.\\
128 - You can say very much by
saying very little, small grasshopper.\\
129 - Pretend you're Laurie
and insult me.\\
130 - Okay.\\
131 - Hey, Hyde, you're stupid.\\
132 - Whatever.\\
133 - Wow! That was great!\\
134 - Yeah.\\
135 - Now. Another part
of this is ambiguity.\\
136 - Say it with me.\\
137 - Ambiguity.
Ambiguity.\\
138 - Very good. See, you
don't want people to know\\
139 - exactly what you mean.\\
140 - Here. Ask me if I want
to go to a movie tonight.\\
141 - Okay. Hyde, would you
like to go to a movie tonight?\\
142 - That's cool.\\
143 - See, you don't know if I
mean "That's cool, I'll go,"\\
144 - Or "That's cool,
no, thanks."\\
145 - And that's cool.
Whatever.\\
146 - Oh, my God!\\
147 - I am so sorry I got impatient.\\
148 - That's cool.\\
149 - Hey, guys.\\
150 - So, Jackie, Eric won't
invite me to dinner tonight.\\
151 - So, do you want to, like,
go to the mall or something?\\
152 - That's cool.\\
153 - Wait. What
do you mean?\\
154 - Oh, my God, it worked.\\
155 - I mean...\\
156 - Whatever.\\
157 - Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.\\
158 - - What?
- What?\\
159 - You guys started
eatin' without me?\\
160 - That is so rude!\\
161 - I'm just kiddin'!\\
162 - Well, Eric, you must've
forgotten to mention\\
163 - that you invited
Michael to dinner tonight.\\
164 - Oh, right. Uh...\\
165 - Yeah, I guess I did.\\
166 - Oh, and there
are my chocolates...\\
167 - The chocolates that I asked
you to bring over to me.\\
168 - Ooh, Fanny Farmer.
My favorite.\\
169 - No, no.
Those are for Laurie.\\
170 - Kelso, what the hell
are you doing here?\\
171 - Dad!\\
172 - Uh...\\
173 - Nougat?\\
174 - Don't worry, Red.\\
175 - I got somethin' for you, too.\\
176 - Ah...\\
177 - Five beers?\\
178 - Uh, yeah. They were
all out of six-packs.\\
179 - Weird, huh?\\
180 - Let me help you out
with that there, Red.\\
181 - Are you takin' a beer?\\
182 - Hey, focus, man! He's
datin' your daughter!\\
183 - Laurie...\\
184 - What's goin' on?\\
185 - He's my boyfriend, Daddy!\\
186 - And he loves me, and...\\
187 - He's good to me, and we're...\\
188 - Happy together.\\
189 - Kelso,\\
190 - you have five seconds\\
191 - to get as far away
from me as possible!\\
192 - But, Red, what about
our unspoken bond?\\
193 - One!\\
194 - Two!\\
195 - I'll call you.\\
196 - Beer, Red?\\
197 - And the rest of dinner,\\
198 - was eaten in complete silence.\\
199 - The only sound
was the dull throbbing\\
200 - of that vein
in Red's giant, shiny head.\\
201 - Boy, I'm glad I'm not Kelso.\\
202 - Sure, he's had sex a lot
and I am still a virgin,\\
203 - but...\\
204 - Oh, I wish I was Kelso.\\
205 - No, you don't, Fez.\\
206 - Being Kelso is like\\
207 - knowing the truth behind all
the deceptions in society,\\
208 - but not being able to convince
any of your fellow suburban clones\\
209 - that anything's wrong, man.\\
210 - No, wait. That's me.\\
211 - Man.\\
212 - I just totally forgot
why I was laughing.\\
213 - Isn't that funny?\\
214 - Ok, uh, no more for
the cheerleader. Okay?\\
215 - Jackie, you seem different.\\
216 - I don't know if it's
your hair, your outfit...\\
217 - Or your red, puffy eyes.\\
218 - She's Zen, man.\\
219 - I've taken her under my wing.\\
220 - I'm running a dojo of coolness.\\
221 - Jackie, demonstrate.\\
222 - Oogly moogly.\\
223 - Googly.\\
224 - Yeah, it's her first day.\\
225 - Kitty, I don't want our daughter\\
226 - dating that kettlehead.\\
227 - Well, maybe it's just a phase.\\
228 - No. He's been
a kettlehead since...\\
229 - No. No. I meant Laurie.\\
230 - This is how it starts, you know.\\
231 - First they're dating
and having fun.\\
232 - And then the next thing
you know,\\
233 - they're pryin' the money to pay for a
wedding from my cold, dead hands.\\
234 - Oh, honey, they're
not gonna get married.\\
235 - He'll leave her
when she gets pregnant.\\
236 - Oh. Okay.\\
237 - I see Mr. Smiley
isn't in town today.\\
238 - I expected more from her.\\
239 - What the hell is she doing
with some high-school kid?\\
240 - She went to college!\\
241 - Well, she did flunk out.\\
242 - Oh, Kitty...\\
243 - I can see how their future
is gonna turn out...\\
244 - And it's not good.\\
245 - More
mashed potatoes, Red?\\
246 - Why, thank you, Servotron 2000.\\
247 - Oh, that's cold.\\
248 - Damn foreign robots.\\
249 - Oh, it's so nice to have
dinner with the family like this.\\
250 - Yeah. It's a good thing we found a
baby-sitting droid for the quintuplets.\\
251 - So, Michael, how's
the job hunt going?\\
252 - Great! They had a real short
line at the unemployment office,\\
253 - so I got home in time to catch
the end of The Space Price is Right.\\
254 - You know, times are tough
for me and Kelso right now.\\
255 - You'll help us,
won't you, Daddy?\\
256 - I'll always be there
for you, honey.\\
257 - I think she means
financially, Red.\\
258 - I know what she means...\\
259 - Kettlehead.\\
260 - You're givin' us more
money... Right, dude?\\
261 - Yes, damn it!\\
262 - All right.
All right.\\
263 - Hey, Laurie, I think
it's time for our "nap".\\
264 - All right!
That's it!\\
265 - I've gotta go to Saturn
on business for a week.\\
266 - Now, when I get back,
you better have a job,\\
267 - or it's off to the
asteroid mines for you!\\
268 - Don't forget
your briefcase, Red.\\
269 - Thank you, Servotron 2000.\\
270 - Now...\\
271 - Roll back the roof,
'cause I gotta go.\\
272 - Jetpack...
Blast off!\\
273 - Red.\\
274 - Red.\\
275 - Ahem. That's it.\\
276 - I'm just gonna tell her that
she can't see him anymore.\\
277 - Nope, nope.
You can't do that, Red.\\
278 - In fact, the more we fight it,\\
279 - the more she's gonna
want to be with... Kettlehead.\\
280 - At this rate, I'm gonna
have a heart attack\\
281 - before I even get my jetpack.\\
282 - You know...
I missed you guys.\\
283 - Yeah. This place just isn't
the same when I'm not around.\\
284 - Oh, hey. You guys want
to hear a really funny story?\\
285 - I was just upstairs, and Red
was yelling at me about you.\\
286 - And, uh, then I said,\\
287 - "What are you doin' yellin' at
me? Kelso's right downstairs.\\
288 - "In fact, I'll go get
him for you," I said.\\
289 - Say, that is a funny story.\\
290 - I don't care.
I'll talk to Red.\\
291 - He was really mean to me, and
here I brought him a five-pack.\\
292 - So I hope he's
ready to apologize.\\
293 - Oh, yeah!\\
294 - Yeah, that's it.\\
295 - If there's one thing Red's
about, it's forgiveness.\\
296 - No, he's not.\\
297 - He's the opposite of that.\\
298 - Oh, wait.\\
299 - I get you.\\
300 - Funny.\\
301 - Wait. Uh...\\
302 - Red, can't we, uh,
leave that open?\\
303 - Have a seat, Kelso.\\
304 - You know, I've been thinking\\
305 - a lot about your relationship\\
306 - with my only daughter.\\
307 - She's a gem.\\
308 - Shut up.\\
309 - Kitty says that if the two of
you want to see each other,\\
310 - there's nothing
I can do about it.\\
311 - But she's wrong...
'Cause I could kill you.\\
312 - That's a joke, Kelso. You
should laugh when I make a joke.\\
313 - Hey, good one, Red.\\
314 - See, you're making me think that I
should take a personal interest in you,\\
315 - and you don't want that.
Take Eric, for example.\\
316 - I have a personal
interest in him.\\
317 - Oh, God.\\
318 - There you go.\\
319 - What you want to do here\\
320 - is fly in under my radar\\
321 - so that if I never see
you and Laurie together\\
322 - or hear your name mentioned
in the same breath,\\
323 - I might just forget that
you even exist. Got it?\\
324 - Yeah...\\
325 - Okay, so you mean
if me and Laurie...\\
326 - Oh, now, see, you just
mentioned my daughter's name.\\
327 - I'm sorry.\\
328 - Okay. Um...\\
329 - If Kelso and your daughter...\\
330 - No, no, no. See, now, that's,
uh... That's not gonna work, either.\\
331 - Well, this is hard, Red!\\
332 - Yeah. Well, you're gonna be
here 'til you get it right, Kelso.\\
333 - Okay, Red, but
eventually my parents\\
334 - are gonna come lookin' for me.\\
335 - Yeah, but they're
not gonna find you.\\
336 - Oh, that's another joke.
Come on, laugh, Kelso!\\
337 - Oh, you again.\\
338 - What happened? Did they let
out kindergarten early today?\\
339 - Whatever.\\
340 - Jackie, don't you
have a lame comeback\\
341 - saved for just
this very occasion?\\
342 - That's cool.\\
343 - Oh, so now you're
Little Miss Cool, huh?\\
344 - Whatever.\\
345 - Well, if you're really as
cool as you think you are,\\
346 - you would've been able to
hold on to your one true love.\\
347 - But you couldn't, could you?\\
348 - Loser!\\
349 - Oh, well.\\
350 - Catfight!\\
351 - You guys, stop it!\\
352 - Ow! You bit me!
Jackie, hit her in the eye!\\
353 - Ow, my eye!\\
354 - Oh, I know! We can
pour water on them,\\
355 - and then we can see
through their shirts!\\
356 - Oh!\\
357 - Bitch!\\
358 - You kicked her ass, man!\\
359 - Yeah.\\
360 - Yeah.\\
361 - Whatever.\\
362 - Oh, my gosh. I am so turned on.\\
363 - I can't believe Laurie bit me.\\
364 - I hope she didn't give
me, like, slut rabies.\\
365 - Jackie...\\
366 - You're my hero.\\
367 - You hit her in the eye.\\
368 - Yeah, but I guess\\
369 - it wasn't very Zen
of me, was it, Hyde?\\
370 - Well, where Zen ends,\\
371 - ass-kicking begins.\\
372 - That's your final lesson,
grasshopper.\\
373 - Hey, man...\\
374 - Let's do that thing\\
375 - where we all sit
in the circle again.\\
376 - Oh, one step ahead of ya.\\
377 - The fact that you actually
went into the garage with Red,\\
378 - that's so brave.\\
379 - Yeah.\\
380 - I guess we both had to
fight for our love, baby.\\
381 - I'm coming
in the living room now!\\
382 - Oh!\\
383 - Well. Hi, there, kitten.\\
384 - Hi, Daddy.
\subsection {Episode 26: Moon Over Point Place (1)}

copy of the yearbook,\\
3 - and you'll all be happy to know\\
4 - that 1977
is my cutest year ever.\\
5 - Jackie, that is so weird,\\
6 - because I was just
telling the gang\\
7 - how there's no way you
could be cuter than last year.\\
8 - You were?\\
9 - Yes.\\
10 - I, for one, totally believe\\
11 - that you are cuter this year.\\
12 - Yeah, since I dumped you.\\
13 - Nice burn.\\
14 - Donna, we've talked about that.\\
15 - Hey, Steven, wanna
pop some popcorn\\
16 - and look at all the
yearbook pictures of me?\\
17 - No. I figure I'll do
plenty of that\\
18 - when I die and go to hell.\\
19 - God, you're such a card.\\
20 - This is so exciting,\\
21 - my first American yearbook.\\
22 - Show us some pictures of Fez.\\
23 - Sorry, Fez.
There aren't any.\\
24 - What the hell?\\
25 - So, they don't let
foreigners in your yearbook?\\
26 - Uh-huh.\\
27 - Here's me cheering at
the pep rally last fall.\\
28 - Oh, my God.\\
29 - Someone in the crowd is mooning.\\
30 - You're all cheering away,\\
31 - and the whole time
you're getting mooned.\\
32 - Yeah!\\
33 - Oh, my God.\\
34 - That's a girl butt.
Hee hee!\\
35 - There's girl butt
in the yearbook.\\
36 - Oh, man, I can't tell who it is.\\
37 - I wish we had
a magnifying glass.\\
38 - Oh. Here you go.\\
39 - I was just playing
with some bugs.\\
40 - God, I can't believe it.\\
41 - Someone's nasty butt
is in my picture.\\
42 - Oh, my God.\\
43 - That's not girl butt.\\
44 - That's Donna's butt!\\
45 - Yeah! It is.\\
46 - Hangin' out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - Eric?\\
56 - Are you okay? 'Cause
you look weird.\\
57 - Yeah. Could it be\\
58 - because of your
girlfriend's naked butt?\\
59 - Kelso, you're not helping.\\
60 - I'm not trying to help.\\
61 - Eric, it's no big deal.\\
62 - It is, too, Donna.\\
63 - Your nasty butt
ruined my picture.\\
64 - Hey. Maybe
your nasty face\\
65 - ruined my butt picture.\\
66 - I know why I'm not
in the yearbook.\\
67 - It because whitey's
keeping me down.\\
68 - Hey, Fez.\\
69 - Just look at Donna's
naked butt some more.\\
70 - Yes, that's nice, thank you.\\
71 - Okay.\\
72 - Okay.\\
73 - Donna, take me through
the chain of events.\\
74 - Now, you're at the pep rally...\\
75 - Oh, and at this point,
your pants are on.\\
76 - Right. And then
they weren't.\\
77 - Donna, mooning's not
something you just do.\\
78 - No. It's not something
you just do,\\
79 - because it's impossible to moon\\
80 - when you have no ass.\\
81 - Michael is such a boy.\\
82 - He doesn't even know who he is.\\
83 - You know who knows who he is?\\
84 - Steven Hyde.\\
85 - Oh, no. Now you
like Hyde?\\
86 - No. I don't like him.\\
87 - I just think, he's,
like, the sweetest,\\
88 - coolest guy I've ever met.\\
89 - Jackie, I thought you hated him.\\
90 - Feelings change, Donna.\\
91 - Like, remember when we first met\\
92 - and I hated you?\\
93 - What?\\
94 - Yeah. I thought you
were, like, this big goon.\\
95 - Didn't we have this talk?\\
96 - No.\\
97 - I'm so sorry.\\
98 - It's okay. I mean,
I hated you, too.\\
99 - Yeah. That's 'cause
you're a big goon.\\
100 - Bitch.\\
101 - Goon.\\
102 - Bitch.
Goon!\\
103 - See? See?
We're closer than ever.\\
104 - I gotta go find Steven.\\
105 - Oh. Ha-ha.\\
106 - Hello, strangers.\\
107 - Look, Red, it's the Pinciottis.\\
108 - Yeah. And they're
dressed the same.\\
109 - We were jogging.\\
110 - So you had to dress the same?\\
111 - Well, I hope we're still on\\
112 - for cards tomorrow night.\\
113 - Oh, about that.
Uh, we can't...\\
114 - Hey, no excuses necessary.\\
115 - Gosh darn the luck.\\
116 - That just makes me so sad.\\
117 - I gotta go inside.\\
118 - Well, me, too.\\
119 - Um, Midge, is something
bothering Bob?\\
120 - Oh, he's uncomfortable
around you and Red\\
121 - now that Donna and Eric...
Know each other.\\
122 - If you know what I mean.\\
123 - You see, I'm using
the word "know"\\
124 - in a different way here.\\
125 - Uh-huh?\\
126 - It's a pun.\\
127 - It's not a...\\
128 - Okay, Midge, good pun.\\
129 - Bye-bye now.\\
130 - Oh, they are nuts.\\
131 - Yeah. There's a lot
of things about Steven\\
132 - that I used to not like,
that now I really like.\\
133 - Like, well, I thought
his pork-chop sideburns\\
134 - were a sign that he
was poor and dirty\\
135 - and lived in a shack.\\
136 - But then I realized
that Elvis had sideburns,\\
137 - and he lived in Graceland.\\
138 - Well, that was an eye-opener.\\
139 - There he is.
Hi, Steven.\\
140 - What's she doing here?\\
141 - I think she's
hittin' on me, man.\\
142 - But I ain't interested.\\
143 - Tell her I ain't interested
and make her go away.\\
144 - Hitting on you?\\
145 - I am not hitting
on you, you relic.\\
146 - Hey, name-calling is no way
to win someone's heart.\\
147 - What are you talking about?\\
148 - What are you talkin' about?\\
149 - What are you talking about?\\
150 - What are you talkin' about?\\
151 - What are you talking about?\\
152 - What are you talkin' about?\\
153 - Oh, my God.\\
154 - Great. Now
he got away.\\
155 - Steven!\\
156 - What was she talking about?\\
157 - Man, I don't know what's
gotten into Jackie.\\
158 - Steven, let's hang out.\\
159 - Steven, let's go to the mall.\\
160 - My life's a living
hell, you know?\\
161 - Steven, you're hilarious!\\
162 - You know, Steven
and I tease each other.\\
163 - That's what best friends do.\\
164 - You know what?\\
165 - I love showing my butt.\\
166 - I don't care what Eric says.\\
167 - I like to show it,
and I like to shake it.\\
168 - Donna, I can totally
respect that.\\
169 - Just be careful, though,\\
170 - or they'll call you
a home-wrecker.\\
171 - I can count the number
of homes I've wrecked\\
172 - on one hand.\\
173 - Well, don't worry, ladies,\\
174 - 'cause no one's gonna
label you here.\\
175 - If you guys wanna
take off some clothes\\
176 - and shake some stuff, feel free.\\
177 - Not you.\\
178 - I wouldn't call you
a home-wrecker, Laurie.\\
179 - No. I'd call you a slut.\\
180 - And a home-wrecker.\\
181 - Shake, shake, shake\\
182 - Shake, shake, shake\\
183 - Shake your booty\\
184 - Whoo! Rock it, girl.\\
185 - Shake your booty\\
186 - Yeah. That's good stuff.\\
187 - Hey. Let's see
a smile.\\
188 - After all,\\
189 - no card game with the
Looney Tunes tonight.\\
190 - Red, they are the only
friends we've got.\\
191 - I am having them over tonight\\
192 - so we can clear the air.\\
193 - No. No, no.\\
194 - I don't wanna clear the air.\\
195 - Red, I'm clearing the air.\\
196 - Kitty, this is our chance
to grow apart.\\
197 - How can you throw that away?\\
198 - How?\\
199 - Because six nights a week,\\
200 - I have to stare
at your sour puss,\\
201 - and even God got to
rest one day a week.\\
202 - Hey.\\
203 - Hey.\\
204 - So, the yearbooks are out\\
205 - and no one's noticed your...\\
206 - Fleshy indiscretion.\\
207 - So I guess I'm cool with it.\\
208 - What a relief.\\
209 - I tossed and turned all night.\\
210 - Well, relax, Donna.
Relax.\\
211 - Because, I mean,
it's a tiny picture,\\
212 - it's all out of focus.\\
213 - I think it's safe to say\\
214 - this little episode
is behind us now.\\
215 - Hey, everybody!\\
216 - Donna showed her ass!\\
217 - Donna showed her ass!\\
218 - Donna showed her ass!\\
219 - Donna showed her ass!\\
220 - Donna showed her ass!\\
221 - Yeah!\\
222 - Okay, um...\\
223 - We're been friends and
neighbors for a long time,\\
224 - and, um, I think there's
something we need to talk about.\\
225 - Don't you, Bob?\\
226 - Nope.\\
227 - Kitty, don't push him.\\
228 - He might just get up and leave.\\
229 - I'd respect you
if you got up and left.\\
230 - Eric and Donna are having sex.\\
231 - What the hell?
Kitty!\\
232 - I didn't know
that clearing the air\\
233 - meant we were gonna have
a sex talk with the neighbors.\\
234 - I did.\\
235 - And I thought
it was gonna be fun,\\
236 - and it is fun.\\
237 - I think what Midge means\\
238 - is it's good to clear the air.\\
239 - Secrets cause cancer.\\
240 - Fine. Bring it on.\\
241 - Just so long as I don't
have to talk about this.\\
242 - I gotta say,
I'm with Bob on this.\\
243 - Right. So let's all
just not talk.\\
244 - Okay. Deal.\\
245 - Okay. Deal, buddy.\\
246 - No, Bob.\\
247 - Deal.\\
248 - You lose again, cracker.\\
249 - Why don't you go home and
cry to your big white mama?\\
250 - Well, first of all, dude,
I think I'm Chinese.\\
251 - And second of all,\\
252 - let me see you put your
money where your mouth is.\\
253 - I don't know, 20 bucks.\\
254 - I'm gonna have to dip into
my baby-sitting money.\\
255 - I mean...
My drag-racing money.\\
256 - Time to lose,
little white girls.\\
257 - Score!\\
258 - Hey, I just remembered, man,\\
259 - I'm really good at this game.\\
260 - Ooh, Steven!\\
261 - I'm so glad you're here.\\
262 - Jackie, please,
I'm right in the middle\\
263 - of "Smokey and
the Band-Aid," okay?\\
264 - Okay. Fine.\\
265 - But I signed us up
for roller-disco lessons\\
266 - at skateworld tonight.\\
267 - Class starts in half an hour,\\
268 - so we'd better hustle.\\
269 - You get it? Hustle?\\
270 - Okay. Let me explain
something to you.\\
271 - On Friday nights,
I don't roller-disco.\\
272 - I go out looking
for roller-discoers\\
273 - to punch in the head.\\
274 - Okay. Fine. We won't
roller-disco.\\
275 - We'll do anything you want.\\
276 - No, we won't.\\
277 - Look, man,\\
278 - you and I don't have
anything in common.\\
279 - You're, like, a square.\\
280 - You know?
A cheerleader.\\
281 - So just...\\
282 - Roller-disco
on out of here, okay?\\
283 - Fine. Fine. I guess
I'm not cool enough\\
284 - to hang out with you anymore.\\
285 - Now you're getting it.\\
286 - You know what, Steven?\\
287 - You think you know me,
but you don't.\\
288 - You don't know me at all.\\
289 - I know you like unicorns,\\
290 - so bye-bye.\\
291 - Oh, my God.
Call Walter Cronkite.\\
292 - My girlfriend has her pants on.\\
293 - Okay. You're behaving
like the biggest baby.\\
294 - What's your problem?\\
295 - What's my...\\
296 - My problem is,
it's your... butt.\\
297 - It's our butt.
It's my butt.\\
298 - Eric, it's my butt.\\
299 - And when I showed
it, it was funny.\\
300 - And you should be glad
that you have a girlfriend\\
301 - who's cool enough to moon.\\
302 - Well... yeah, okay.\\
303 - I mean, you're right,
but... you know what?\\
304 - Once the jocks and the guys
with the Firebirds see it,\\
305 - you know, they're just
gonna totally want you.\\
306 - Oh, no. And with my
weak-willed girly mind,\\
307 - I'll go, too.\\
308 - You're such a bonehead.\\
309 - Yeah, I know.\\
310 - Okay. It's great.\\
311 - But, you know, in the
future, would it kill you\\
312 - just to have
a smidgen of modesty?\\
313 - Oh, my God.\\
314 - What...\\
315 - What's so funny?\\
316 - You're a prude.\\
317 - I am not.\\
318 - Yes. You're uptight,
like a little pilgrim.\\
319 - Oh, yeah?\\
320 - Yeah.\\
321 - Oh, yeah?
Yeah.\\
322 - In the end,\\
323 - I'm glad my Donna's
with your Eric.\\
324 - At least I know Eric's
not a degenerate.\\
325 - Who's the prude now, huh?\\
326 - My ass is swinging,
baby! Whoo!\\
327 - Eric.\\
328 - Hi, mom.\\
329 - So, Bob, you wanna go ahead\\
330 - and cancel next week's
game, buddy?\\
331 - Okay.\\
332 - Tie game.\\
333 - This is it, Fez.\\
334 - Channel all of your hatred
for the white man\\
335 - into this one last point.\\
336 - I am full of hate, my brother.\\
337 - Hey, foreign guy,\\
338 - will you sign your
yearbook picture?\\
339 - My what-book picture?\\
340 - Oh, my God.\\
341 - It is half my face.\\
342 - Oh, I feel the warm love
and embrace of the whitey.\\
343 - I forfeit. You win.\\
344 - No. No, no!\\
345 - Look, no one is
embracing you, Fez.\\
346 - You're brown, okay?\\
347 - So let's kick some racist ass!\\
348 - We lost?\\
349 - Nice game, my white friends.\\
350 - You owe me money!\\
351 - Hey, Hyde.\\
352 - Oh, no.\\
353 - Is the roller-disco
craze over already?\\
354 - Of course not.\\
355 - Look, Hyde, I just
wanted you to know\\
356 - that I'm not
a square cheerleader.\\
357 - I'm on the wrong side
of the law,\\
358 - because I have this.\\
359 - Oh, no.
A paper bag. Run.\\
360 - Jackie?\\
361 - Oh, yeah.\\
362 - I bought it in the ghetto.\\
363 - Jackie, there is no ghetto here.\\
364 - There's, like, that one house\\
365 - that needs to be painted.\\
366 - Okay, fine. I bought it
from my housekeeper.\\
367 - Whatever.\\
368 - So, what are you saying?\\
369 - You wanna be, like,
a burnout now?\\
370 - No. No, Hyde, I just
wanna be with you.\\
371 - Okay? I think you're
one of the coolest,\\
372 - sweetest guys I've ever met.\\
373 - No, you don't.\\
374 - Yes, I do.\\
375 - Is there
a problem here?\\
376 - No, sir, Officer.\\
377 - There's no problem
at all, right, Jackie?\\
378 - There's nothing in the bag.\\
379 - Okay, Miss, let's go.\\
380 - No, no. I can't
go to jail.\\
381 - I have to cheer tomorrow.\\
382 - What are you doing, man?\\
383 - The bag is mine.\\
384 - Come on, cheerleader, dirtbag.\\
385 - Okay, man.\\
386 - Oh, my God.\\
387 - Steven Hyde, you were right.\\
388 - We will never be friends.
We'll be more than friends.\\
389 - Because now...
I love you.\\
390 - Oh, my God.
Would you shut up?\\
391 - As God is my witness,
I will wait for you.\\
392 - Well, I hope you're happy.\\
393 - I don't think Bob
will ever recover\\
394 - from the sight of your rear end.\\
395 - What rear end?\\
396 - What I can't figure out\\
397 - is how you expected to run away\\
398 - with your pants down
around your ankles.\\
399 - Damn, he's dumb.\\
400 - Hello.\\
401 - Steven, where have you been?\\
402 - You missed
the funniest damn thing.\\
403 - Uh-huh.\\
404 - Uh-huh.\\
405 - Pants around the ankles.\\
406 - Oh, that's great.\\
407 - Look, Red, I gotta talk
to you about something.\\
408 - Arrested?\\
409 - For what?\\
410 - For possession of what?\\
411 - Son of a bitch!\\
412 - Hyde got arrested?\\
413 - For what?\\
414 - For holding?
For holding what?\\
415 - For holding my heart.\\
416 - Because I love him.\\
417 - What?\\
418 - It's true, okay?\\
419 - I love Steven Hyde,\\
420 - and, someday, he'll love me.\\
421 - And he'll cut off
those stupid sideburns\\
422 - and we'll live
happily ever after.\\
423 - What?
\section {That '70s Season how Season 03}
\subsection {Episode 01: Reefer Madness (2)}
1 - Man, who'd have thought.\\
2 - Hyde getting busted
for possession?\\
3 - I mean, I always thought
it'd be armed robbery\\
4 - or pimping.\\
5 - You know, something cool.\\
6 - Yeah, Hyde in jail.\\
7 - Hey, guys, you think he's
anyone's girlfriend yet?\\
8 - Kelso, he's been
in jail for three hours.\\
9 - Of course he's
someone's girlfriend.\\
10 - He has very pretty eyes.\\
11 - Well, if he was
someone's girlfriend,\\
12 - I think it might look
a little something like this.\\
13 - Yeah. Heh heh.\\
14 - Hey there, Curly Q,\\
15 - would you like to perform
an unspeakable act on me,\\
16 - or would you prefer that
I perform one on you?\\
17 - Well, they both sound good.\\
18 - Dealer's choice.\\
19 - You have done a horrible thing
with a children's toy.\\
20 - Ahem!\\
21 - Huh. Bet you didn't want me
to see this, did ya?\\
22 - Hey, welcome back, man.\\
23 - We were worried about...\\
24 - I'm sorry.\\
25 - I'm just...
I'm so sorry.\\
26 - Yeah, uh... you know...\\
27 - Curly Q. Is... can be...\\
28 - Is a term of endearment.\\
29 - So, when do we meet
your new fella?\\
30 - Hangin' out\\
31 - Down the street\\
32 - The same old thing\\
33 - We did last week\\
34 - Not a thing to do\\
35 - But talk to you\\
36 - We're all all right\\
37 - We're all all right\\
38 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
39 - Red...
No.\\
40 - We really need to
talk about Steven.\\
41 - No, I don't wanna
talk about Steven!\\
42 - Subject closed.\\
43 - Red...\\
44 - For God's sakes, Kitty.\\
45 - We took him into our home.\\
46 - We treated him like our own son.\\
47 - Treat him better
than your own son.\\
48 - I'll tell you one thing...\\
49 - I'm not bailin' him out.\\
50 - He can rot in that jail,
for all I care.\\
51 - Actually, they already let
him out. Gave him probation.\\
52 - Probation?\\
53 - Well, isn't that just ducky?\\
54 - You know how they treat
their criminals in Russia?\\
55 - First offense...\\
56 - Five years in Siberia.\\
57 - Second offense, 10 years.\\
58 - Believe you me,\\
59 - there is no third offense.\\
60 - Unless the criminal
likes to make snow angels.\\
61 - Hey, Steven brought
that stuff into my house.\\
62 - And I'm putting a stop to it\\
63 - before things
get out of control.\\
64 - Out of control how?\\
65 - Well, I'll tell you how.\\
66 - Say, chum, where ya headed?\\
67 - Just to see my best girl
Donna, that's where.\\
68 - We're gonna split a soda pop.\\
69 - It'll be keen.\\
70 - Soda pop, eh?\\
71 - I have something that's
even keener than soda pop.\\
72 - It's called marijuana.\\
73 - Mari-whata?\\
74 - Come, I'll show you.\\
75 - Hyde, you were right.\\
76 - Marijuana is the bee's knees.\\
77 - Yep. All it takes
is one puff\\
78 - to make you hopelessly addicted.\\
79 - I am hopelessly addicted.\\
80 - Here's a new shipment,\\
81 - fresh from whatever the hell
country I am from.\\
82 - Gee willickers, Eric.\\
83 - Where have you been?\\
84 - You missed choir practice.\\
85 - Sorry, doll face,\\
86 - but now, thanks to marijuana,\\
87 - I'm incurably insane.\\
88 - Well, I'm not gonna let a
swell kid like you ruin your life.\\
89 - Not so fast, sister.\\
90 - I need that for
the schoolchildren.\\
91 - No!\\
92 - Alas.\\
93 - Marijuana has ended\\
94 - my young, promising life.\\
95 - This is what's happening
all over America.\\
96 - And it could happen
in your home. Or yours.\\
97 - Or yours.\\
98 - I just don't think that's
going to happen, Red.\\
99 - Has Hyde ever pressured you
to use this stuff?\\
100 - No, absolutely not.\\
101 - In fact, yeah,
I can honestly say\\
102 - I have never felt any pressure.\\
103 - Guess who.\\
104 - It's either Jackie\\
105 - or the cold, clammy
hands of death.\\
106 - It's... Jackie.\\
107 - Damn it.\\
108 - Oh, Steven, my hero.\\
109 - When that cop found my bag
and you said it was yours\\
110 - and then they sent you
to the big house,\\
111 - it was, like, the most
romantic thing ever.\\
112 - Yeah. Maybe for you.\\
113 - I was deloused.\\
114 - Hey, man, you missed
your shift at the Fotohut.\\
115 - You better have
a damn good excuse.\\
116 - I got busted.\\
117 - Damn, that's a good excuse.\\
118 - So what'd they get you for?\\
119 - For loving me.\\
120 - Oh, 'cause she's, like, 14?\\
121 - I got busted for possession.\\
122 - Oh, man, join the club.\\
123 - Yeah, thanks.\\
124 - No, I mean join the club.
We meet every Thursday.\\
125 - We're trying to raise money
for a field trip to Amsterdam.\\
126 - Hey there, Red.\\
127 - Taking out the trash, I see.\\
128 - Ahem.\\
129 - Yeah, well, better
late than never.\\
130 - Is that supposed to
mean something, Bob?\\
131 - No.\\
132 - Just happened to notice\\
133 - that that lowlife Hyde
you've been harboring\\
134 - has been busted for possession.\\
135 - My gosh,\\
136 - that stuff was right here
in our own neighborhood?\\
137 - And to think of all the times
we have to drive across town...\\
138 - Ix-nay, Midge.\\
139 - Well, as you all know,\\
140 - we had a little
incident yesterday.\\
141 - And I think that as a family,\\
142 - we should discuss\\
143 - rational solutions\\
144 - to make sure that this
never happens again.\\
145 - Can I start?\\
146 - Um, I'm not comfortable\\
147 - living with a criminal.\\
148 - I think we should kick Hyde out.\\
149 - All in favor?\\
150 - Laurie, stop it.
Red, what do you think?\\
151 - Kick him out, kick
him out, kick him out!\\
152 - Laurie, there is no way
we're kicking Steven out.\\
153 - Steven...\\
154 - We're kicking you out.\\
155 - Yay, Daddy.\\
156 - Red...\\
157 - Dad, that's not fair.\\
158 - Not fair?\\
159 - I took him in,\\
160 - I gave him a shot,\\
161 - he blew it. It's his fault.\\
162 - Look, I don't want it
in my house.\\
163 - I don't want it around you
two. I just... don't... want it.\\
164 - Red.\\
165 - Putting him out on the street\\
166 - is not the solution.\\
167 - This young man needs our
guidance now more than ever.\\
168 - No, Mrs. Forman, it's cool.\\
169 - If Red thinks that\\
170 - I'm not good enough
to live in this house,\\
171 - then I guess I'm not.\\
172 - You know what?\\
173 - You're... you're bull...\\
174 - I... I'm... you're very...\\
175 - I'm... I'm very mad at you!\\
176 - God, this sucks.\\
177 - I can't believe
Red's kicking you out.\\
178 - I mean, I'm sorry.
Where you supposed to go?\\
179 - I'm gonna go to the Fotohut.\\
180 - I'll sleep on the floor.
We got a hose out back.\\
181 - Mrs. Forman
made me a sandwich.\\
182 - Man, this is so wrong.\\
183 - Look, I'm not gonna
let you get kicked out\\
184 - for something that we all do.\\
185 - Hey, hey, don't go
dragging me into this.\\
186 - You know what?\\
187 - I'm gonna tell Red
that I do it, too.\\
188 - No!\\
189 - Have you suddenly become
the stupidest man ever?\\
190 - I mean, is Kelso no
longer the reigning king?\\
191 - Oh, I'm the king.\\
192 - This can work.
If I tell Red,\\
193 - then he's gonna be a hypocrite
for kicking you out\\
194 - and not making me go with him.\\
195 - Because, I mean,
he can't kick me out\\
196 - because you know,
deep down, he loves me.\\
197 - Look, Forman,\\
198 - I appreciate what you're
trying to do, you know,\\
199 - but you getting into trouble is not
gonna help me get out of trouble, okay?\\
200 - Okay?\\
201 - Okay.
Okay.\\
202 - Everybody just stop worrying,
all right? I'll be fine.\\
203 - Yes, it will be good
for you in the Fotohut.\\
204 - Maybe you will
develop some character.\\
205 - Get it? Develop?\\
206 - Oh, fine. I guess
I'm not funny.\\
207 - Kiss my brown ass.\\
208 - Okay, here's your tea, Leo.\\
209 - Oh, wow, tea, man.\\
210 - That's, like, exotic.\\
211 - Heh-heh. Hey, look at me,
I'm the king of England.\\
212 - Off with her head.\\
213 - Tea. Heh-heh.\\
214 - Well, um, I think it's great\\
215 - that Steven has a boss\\
216 - who cares enough to come over\\
217 - and talk to us on his behalf.\\
218 - So, um, I'm just
gonna let you fellas\\
219 - get to know each other.\\
220 - Sit up straight.\\
221 - Hey, man, I don't think you should
kick Hyde out because he's a good kid.\\
222 - He's a doper.\\
223 - You say that like
it's a bad thing, man.\\
224 - Hey, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.\\
225 - I've indulged
once or twice myself.\\
226 - Really?\\
227 - I'm shocked.\\
228 - Yeah, I know.
Upstanding businessman.\\
229 - Last guy you'd expect.\\
230 - But it's true, man.\\
231 - Well, Mr. Hippie...\\
232 - If you say so,\\
233 - well, that's good enough for me.\\
234 - Aw, that's great, man.\\
235 - Now, please,
get out of my house.\\
236 - Okay, what are you writing?
"Jackie and Steven Hyde.\\
237 - "Mrs. Jackie Hyde.\\
238 - "Dr. and Mrs. Steven Hyde?"\\
239 - All right, what's going on?\\
240 - Okay, Donna, Steven
and I are in love.\\
241 - Um, you do know that he once
compared you to a tick, right?\\
242 - Oh, really? Well, if he
thinks I'm such a tick,\\
243 - then why'd he tell the cops the bag
was his when it was actually mine?\\
244 - Are you telling me
that bag was yours?\\
245 - Yeah. He went
to jail for it.\\
246 - Isn't that fabulous?\\
247 - Oh, my God. You... tick.\\
248 - You're the reason
this whole mess happened.\\
249 - Oh, Donna, stop.
My head is... whoo!\\
250 - Jackie, you have to tell
the Formans what happened.\\
251 - Do you know that Red
is kicking Hyde out?\\
252 - Oh, god, no, no, Donna,
that's perfect.\\
253 - When Hyde is on the
streets, he'll have to turn to me,\\
254 - and as I care for him
and buy him stuff,\\
255 - his love for me will grow.\\
256 - Oh, my God.
Fine, I'm telling them.\\
257 - No, no, no. You cannot
ruin this for me,\\
258 - you... moose.\\
259 - Don't tell me
what to do, Midget.\\
260 - No!\\
261 - Well, well, turns out you
were all wrong about Steven,\\
262 - and you wanted to kick him out.\\
263 - Yes. Well, thanks for
telling us the truth, Donna.\\
264 - And we know
it wasn't easy for you,\\
265 - especially with Jackie
choking you the whole time.\\
266 - Uh, Steven, wait.\\
267 - You can stay.\\
268 - Cool.\\
269 - Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
270 - That's it? Isn't there
anything else\\
271 - you would like to say\\
272 - to this brave
and noble young man?\\
273 - You're right, Kitty.\\
274 - Dumb ass!\\
275 - Do you realize that you put
your entire future at risk?\\
276 - What kind of a moron
would go and take the fall...\\
277 - Crying and crying and crying.\\
278 - And when she's upset...\\
279 - And the next thing
you know, I'm upset.\\
280 - I had to have tea\\
281 - with that greasy old hippie.\\
282 - Now I have hippie stink
on my couch.\\
283 - Let me tell you something else.\\
284 - If you ever do anything
like that again,\\
285 - I will kick your ass so hard,\\
286 - your nose will bleed.\\
287 - And we love you.\\
288 - So, uh, just so I'm clear,\\
289 - everything's
back to normal, right?\\
290 - Yeah, yeah, everything's back...\\
291 - All right, Dad, I've
got something to say.\\
292 - Eric, for the love
of God, don't.\\
293 - Dad, I do it, too.\\
294 - That's right. So you
can't kick Hyde out.\\
295 - Honey... we already decided
not to kick Hyde out.\\
296 - Oh.\\
297 - Then...\\
298 - Yay.\\
299 - So, you do it, too, huh?\\
300 - Since when?\\
301 - Since... when?\\
302 - Uh...\\
303 - I am so baked.\\
304 - I think.\\
305 - No, yeah, I am.
I think.\\
306 - You know, guys, I've been
living my life all wrong.\\
307 - All I ever thought about
was school.\\
308 - Studying, reading, homework.\\
309 - Well, that's over.\\
310 - Thanks, Hyde.\\
311 - Hey, man, don't thank me.
Thank my mom.\\
312 - If she hadn't have passed out,\\
313 - I couldn't have
raided her stash.\\
314 - You have the best mom ever.\\
315 - Hey, guys, you know what?\\
316 - Yesterday, I was
wrestling with Donna,\\
317 - and I felt her boob.\\
318 - It was beautiful.\\
319 - Squishy.\\
320 - Squishy. Hey, guys,
I had this dream\\
321 - that I was kissing
my English teacher,\\
322 - and when I woke up,
I was stuck to my bed.\\
323 - Kelso, man, that's not
normal. You could die.\\
324 - Hey, isn't your
English teacher a guy?\\
325 - Yeah. No, I meant
my Spanish teacher.\\
326 - She's a girl. Man,
what's in this stuff?\\
327 - Hey, guys, I'm having
the best time ever.\\
328 - I think.
No, yeah, I am.\\
329 - Eric!\\
330 - Eric!\\
331 - Are you on it right now?\\
332 - I asked you a question.\\
333 - Since when have you
been using this?\\
334 - Uh... about
a week ago tomorrow.\\
335 - Um... what?\\
336 - Yeah, coming, Mom.\\
337 - Okay. Okay, now.\\
338 - You're both smart boys.\\
339 - What were you thinking?\\
340 - Well...
I... I'm not...\\
341 - Oh, oh. Um...\\
342 - The problem was that
we weren't thinking.\\
343 - We weren't thinking.\\
344 - And, you know, with the times...\\
345 - Yeah, the times were, like...\\
346 - And, uh...\\
347 - Peer pressure?\\
348 - And the peer pressure.
Thank you, Mom.\\
349 - Yeah.\\
350 - And, you know, I
found that today, uh...\\
351 - You know, the need
to experiment...\\
352 - Oh, don't try this blaming
society crap with me.\\
353 - You know whose
fault this is? Do you?\\
354 - Do you?\\
355 - Well, I have a pretty good idea.\\
356 - It's mine.\\
357 - Oh. All right.
Okay.\\
358 - The problem is...\\
359 - I've been too lenient.\\
360 - So, from now on,\\
361 - no more easy-going,
devil-may-care,\\
362 - everybody's-best-friend dad.\\
363 - I'm just...
I'm so very nervous.\\
364 - I'm cracking down.\\
365 - And I'm cracking down hard.\\
366 - Starting right now,\\
367 - fun time is over.\\
368 - So where was I for fun time?\\
369 - Take it back!\\
370 - No, Kelso. I'm sorry.\\
371 - Confessing to Red
makes Eric the king.\\
372 - Hey, I shot my toe
with a BB gun once.\\
373 - You're right, Kelso,
you're the king.\\
374 - Thank you!\\
375 - I mean, when I say, "For
the love of God, don't,"\\
376 - then for the love of God, don't.\\
377 - Donna, that could've
meant anything.\\
378 - Okay, I'm sorry. I made
a terrible mistake.\\
379 - All right, excuse me, but
I think we've all lost sight\\
380 - of what's really important
here... We're in love.\\
381 - All right, you know what?\\
382 - Enough of your
girlie fantasy crap.\\
383 - None of this would've
happened if it wasn't for you.\\
384 - So get this through your
little Easy-Bake-Oven head...\\
385 - I don't love you.\\
386 - I don't like you.\\
387 - I can barely stand
to look at you, okay?\\
388 - Oh, Steven,
you're such a bad liar.\\
389 - All right. Well,
don't mind me.\\
390 - I'm just here to install
this smoke detector.\\
391 - Smoke detector?\\
392 - Does that detect
any kind of smoke?\\
393 - Long live the king.\\
394 - Hey, guys, look what I found
in my sister Laurie's drawer.\\
395 - Mints. A whole
month's worth.\\
396 - They're not minty.\\
397 - They're not mints.\\
398 - They're birth control pills,
you headgear-wearing moron.\\
399 - Hey, when I grow up,\\
400 - I'm gonna be handsome.\\
401 - Really? Did your mommy
tell you that?\\
402 - Yeah.\\
403 - Kelso, you're the king.
\subsection {Episode 02: Red Sees Red}
1 - I had a great time
on our date tonight.\\
2 - Yeah. When do you think Red's going
to give you back the keys to the cruiser?\\
3 - You know, so we could
actually leave the property?\\
4 - I don't know.
Maybe never.\\
5 - In fact, you're my only contact\\
6 - with the outside
world now, Donna.\\
7 - Do people still laugh out there?\\
8 - I miss the laughter.\\
9 - Well, Eric,
it's your own stupid fault.\\
10 - I mean, before you
opened your big mouth,\\
11 - Red actually believed
that smell was incense.\\
12 - Yeah, I know.
It's just...\\
13 - He was going to kick Hyde
out and I wanted to help,\\
14 - and, oh, helping never helps.\\
15 - All right, look. Let's not
waste time talking about this.\\
16 - How long till curfew?\\
17 - About one minute.\\
18 - Now, Donna, I'm not bragging,\\
19 - but if you're
properly motivated,\\
20 - I can actually do it
in that amount of time.\\
21 - You don't have to tell me.\\
22 - Okay, so buckle up, Donna,\\
23 - 'cause the next 12 seconds
are all about you, babe.\\
24 - Five, four,
three, two, one.\\
25 - No, wait! Damn!\\
26 - Curfew, hophead.\\
27 - Hangin' out\\
28 - Down the street\\
29 - The same old thing\\
30 - We did last week\\
31 - Not a thing to do\\
32 - But talk to you\\
33 - We're all all right\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
36 - Jeez, I wish I had
a quarter for every time\\
37 - I caught you making out
with the neighbor girl.\\
38 - Wish I had a quarter for every
time you embarrassed me.\\
39 - I wish you did, too,\\
40 - 'cause then
you'd be a millionaire\\
41 - and you could find
someplace else to live.\\
42 - What, and leave all this?\\
43 - Okay, fellas.
Who wants brownies\\
44 - and a nice glass of milk?\\
45 - Oh, jeez.\\
46 - Daddy, I think it's great\\
47 - you gave Eric and Hyde a curfew.\\
48 - These boys, they need structure.\\
49 - Well, I'll see ya.\\
50 - Where do you think you're going?\\
51 - To... night church?\\
52 - Sorry, honey.
Curfew's for everyone.\\
53 - But, Daddy, it's me!\\
54 - Look, what they did is bad,\\
55 - but you sneaking around
with Kelso, that's just...\\
56 - Unpleasant.\\
57 - But, Daddy,
I'm not seeing Kelso.\\
58 - Untrue!
A damnable lie!\\
59 - A curfew?\\
60 - I'm stuck in this house
with you people all night?\\
61 - This sucks!\\
62 - Well, we're just
thrilled about it.\\
63 - So, all right. There's
an upside to all this.\\
64 - I took her down with me.\\
65 - Nice job.\\
66 - Well, isn't this a happy house?\\
67 - Yeah.\\
68 - This is not a happy house.\\
69 - Well, you just said
this was a happy house.\\
70 - Well, that's not what I meant.\\
71 - It was sarcasm.\\
72 - Well, who the hell
knows what you mean\\
73 - when you won't say
what you mean?\\
74 - I don't like how you're
treating the children.\\
75 - Look, Kitty.\\
76 - I'm not gonna let our kids
go down the wrong path.\\
77 - But if you have a
better idea, I'm all ears.\\
78 - Okay. Maybe you
could be a little less strict\\
79 - and a little more loving.\\
80 - Okay, Kitty.
Enough with the sarcasm.\\
81 - Stop looking at me! Stop
looking at me! Stop looking at me!\\
82 - Please look at me.\\
83 - Hey, psst!\\
84 - I love you, Steven.\\
85 - I have secret love powers.\\
86 - Look at me!\\
87 - Uh! I have 29 teeth.\\
88 - No, that can't be right.
1, 2, 3...\\
89 - Jackie's in love with
Hyde and I have nothing.\\
90 - Oh, look!
I find an M&M!\\
91 - Oh, no.\\
92 - My life sucks.\\
93 - Okay, I really hope
no one smelled that.\\
94 - All right!\\
95 - I'm the best-looking person
in this room.\\
96 - No! In this whole town!\\
97 - No! No! In this whole state!\\
98 - No!\\
99 - Dumb asses.\\
100 - So, how's it going?\\
101 - Real good.\\
102 - The foreign kid just ate
something off the floor.\\
103 - Okay. Well, um... Your
father's gonna drive me to work.\\
104 - That's right,\\
105 - and if you do anything
wrong, I'll know,\\
106 - because one of you is a snitch.\\
107 - You just think about that
while I'm gone.\\
108 - Well, they're not gonna
do anything wrong,\\
109 - because I brought
a box of activities\\
110 - to occupy their time.\\
111 - So, um, be good and have fun.\\
112 - Do crafts, not drugs.\\
113 - Ooh, a model airplane and glue.\\
114 - Where are Steven and Eric?\\
115 - Um...\\
116 - Your hair is very pretty.\\
117 - Oh, they can't leave the
house. They're grounded.\\
118 - Oh, don't worry about them.\\
119 - They're at the Hub.\\
120 - Oh, no.
I am the snitch.\\
121 - Oh, Red is gonna be furious.\\
122 - Mrs. Forman,\\
123 - may I tell you a little
story about oppression?\\
124 - Okay.\\
125 - Once I had an ant farm,\\
126 - and they would not
build their tunnels.\\
127 - I was furious,\\
128 - so I became very strict
and stern with my ants.\\
129 - First they feared me
and everything was fine,\\
130 - but eventually\\
131 - the ants broke out
and attacked me.\\
132 - So I had to kill them.\\
133 - So, um, you think we're
being too hard on the kids.\\
134 - Well, I don't know about that.\\
135 - I just wanted to let you know\\
136 - that I'm really sad
because my ants are dead.\\
137 - Okay.\\
138 - Well, Fez, thanks.\\
139 - You're a good boy.\\
140 - All the ladies
want a piece of Fez.\\
141 - What are you doing?\\
142 - Oh, just a little
security measure\\
143 - in case anybody tries to escape.\\
144 - Red, no. Those are
my Christmas bells.\\
145 - Those are happy bells.\\
146 - Then they're doing their
job, because I'm happy.\\
147 - Let's have some cake.\\
148 - Okay, and let's watch some TV,\\
149 - because that makes us all happy.\\
150 - Okay, here we go.\\
151 - The Brady Bunch
Variety Hour is on.\\
152 - Oh, who the hell gave
those people an entire hour?\\
153 - Well, I think
this program is fun\\
154 - for the whole family.\\
155 - They've got Charo
and the rock band KISS.\\
156 - Okay, see? Now,
this is nice.\\
157 - A nice family who gets along\\
158 - and sings and dances.\\
159 - Yeah, I love the Bradys.\\
160 - Oh! Remember that episode\\
161 - where Mr. Brady
went completely insane\\
162 - and put bells on all the doors?\\
163 - Hey, did you see the one
where Greg was a real wise ass\\
164 - and Mr. Brady took him
outside and cleaned his clock?\\
165 - Did you ever see the one
where I hated living here?\\
166 - That one's my favorite.\\
167 - Well, I hope you're happy because
now you've upset your sister.\\
168 - Oh, you know what?
Forget it, Dad.\\
169 - Enjoy yourself.
Get your shots in now\\
170 - because when I'm gone,\\
171 - oh, I'm gonna be long gone.\\
172 - I got no place to go, so...\\
173 - I'm gonna stay here.\\
174 - But the tension's nice.\\
175 - Reminds me of home.\\
176 - Finally.\\
177 - Now I can enjoy the show
in peace.\\
178 - Oh, this show is crap.\\
179 - Feel funky
Whoo\\
180 - Feel good
Whoo\\
181 - Gonna tell you
I'm in the neighborhood\\
182 - Gonna fly
like a bird on the wing\\
183 - Hold on to your hat,
honey\\
184 - Sing, sing, sing sing\\
185 - I got the music in me\\
186 - I got the music in me\\
187 - I got the music in me\\
188 - I got the music in me\\
189 - I got the music in me\\
190 - I got the music in me\\
191 - Yeah!\\
192 - Thank you, thank you!\\
193 - And welcome to The Forman
Bunch Variety Hour! Ha-ha!\\
194 - And, boy, do we have a
great show for you tonight!\\
195 - Sorry, Mom, we can't
stay for the show.\\
196 - No!\\
197 - Why not?\\
198 - Well, living at home
is unbearable,\\
199 - so we've decided to run away.\\
200 - No!\\
201 - Yay!\\
202 - So, thanks for everything,
Mrs. F.\\
203 - Well, you boys can't run away.\\
204 - Who's gonna do the square dance\\
205 - with Shields and Yarnell?\\
206 - Well, let Laurie do it.\\
207 - She's been making out
with Shields all day.\\
208 - That's a lie!\\
209 - Well, when will I see you again?\\
210 - Don't worry, Kitty.
I'll take care of them.\\
211 - Oh, ladies and gentlemen,\\
212 - star of stage and screen,
Shirley Jones.\\
213 - Hi, Mom!
Hi, Mom!\\
214 - Mom?\\
215 - That's right, Kitty.\\
216 - We're Partridges now.\\
217 - This is gonna be great.\\
218 - I'm pretty sure
I can nail Susan Dey.\\
219 - No! Partridges?\\
220 - You can't live in a bus.\\
221 - There's no toilet!\\
222 - Well, it may be
inconvenient, Kitty,\\
223 - but we do get to spend
a lot of time together.\\
224 - That's right. Mrs.
Partridge quit her job\\
225 - to form a family band.\\
226 - Yep. It's all a matter
of choices, Kitty.\\
227 - I guess you just chose
to be a bad mother.\\
228 - Hey, Shirley, can I come?\\
229 - I play the tambourine.\\
230 - Uh! I'm sorry, Laurie.
No whores on my show.\\
231 - Oh, fine.\\
232 - Hey, Shields, wait up!\\
233 - Aah!\\
234 - Coochie, coochie, coochie!\\
235 - Whoa, whoa, whoa!\\
236 - Can it, Charo.\\
237 - Yah!\\
238 - Well, I am not going
to let that happen.\\
239 - Oh, no.\\
240 - This is crap.\\
241 - Oh, no. Honey!\\
242 - Yep. He thought
he could sneak out.\\
243 - So, what now, Ho Chi Min?\\
244 - Well, I'll tell you one thing.\\
245 - Playtime is over.\\
246 - Your friends are no longer
allowed in the house.\\
247 - Wait. What?\\
248 - No. No. We'll talk
about it in the morning.\\
249 - Fine. We'll talk about
it in the morning.\\
250 - We'll talk about how your friends
are no longer allowed in the house!\\
251 - You know, I have
an interesting idea.\\
252 - Why don't we not punish him?\\
253 - Why don't we try a
little of that forgiveness\\
254 - that Jesus was
always talking about?\\
255 - No. No.\\
256 - This is for his own good.\\
257 - Look. In order for Eric to be
a happy, well-adjusted adult,\\
258 - he has to be miserable now.\\
259 - That's just good parenting.\\
260 - If I was to be
Mr. Nice Guy now,\\
261 - do you know what would
happen to Eric in a few years?\\
262 - Do you?\\
263 - Oh, Eric! Breakfast!\\
264 - Well, there's my sweet
little baby boy.\\
265 - Why, oh, why
didn't I discipline you?\\
266 - Shut up and eat your Cornflakes.\\
267 - Yah!\\
268 - That's what.\\
269 - Never surrender, Kitty.
Never retreat.\\
270 - We're winning.\\
271 - The fact that Eric was desperate
enough to climb out his window\\
272 - shows that
everything is working.\\
273 - Surprise!\\
274 - This is so great!\\
275 - I didn't know you delivered.\\
276 - Bed check,
dumb ass.\\
277 - Holy crap!\\
278 - No, it is not a bed check.\\
279 - We just want to say good night,\\
280 - and we love you very, very much.\\
281 - What are you doing?\\
282 - Oh, just nailing
his window shut.\\
283 - It's for his own good.\\
284 - What if there's a fire?\\
285 - Well, then, I guess you can\\
286 - just light your dope
with it, dopehead.\\
287 - Donna! Get out!\\
288 - Whoa! Not so fast, Laurie.\\
289 - Ah! Ah! Ah!\\
290 - You idiot! Red's
doing bed checks.\\
291 - Bed checks!\\
292 - And bless Mommy and bless Daddy\\
293 - and bless grandma.\\
294 - Oh, hi, Daddy.\\
295 - Sorry to bother you, kitten.\\
296 - Kelso, get your hand off my ass.\\
297 - It was an accident.\\
298 - Shh!
It's still there.\\
299 - It's still an accident.\\
300 - Kelso, it's still there.\\
301 - Yeah.\\
302 - What?\\
303 - You know, Steven,\\
304 - this hatred thing
you have for me\\
305 - is just you protecting yourself.\\
306 - Okay.\\
307 - It's true. You're afraid
to reach the peaks of love\\
308 - for fear of being
dropped off a cliff.\\
309 - Well, I'm your safety
line, Steven, so grab me.\\
310 - Go grab yourself, freak.\\
311 - Okay, bed check!\\
312 - Here we come!\\
313 - Kitty,
you're warning him!\\
314 - I'm not
warning anybody.\\
315 - Getting closer!\\
316 - Okay, um...\\
317 - We just... we wanted
to say good night\\
318 - and, um, that you're a good boy,\\
319 - and even though you do
some things that we don't like,\\
320 - we still love you.\\
321 - And I'm watching you.\\
322 - And I'm cherishing you.\\
323 - Oh, no, Jackie.
They're still out there.\\
324 - What was that?\\
325 - Oh, and they want our pants.\\
326 - Do you hear that?\\
327 - I don't hear anything.\\
328 - That's right.
Nothing.\\
329 - That's the sound of discipline.\\
330 - No, that's the sound of jail.\\
331 - This house used to be fun
until you made it miserable.\\
332 - Well, I'm sorry, Kitty,
but I think it's working.\\
333 - Oh, you do?\\
334 - Yes, I do.\\
335 - Oh, you do.\\
336 - I just said I did.\\
337 - Red.\\
338 - Oh, hell's bells!\\
339 - It's Red! Run for it!\\
340 - Freeze!\\
341 - Daddy, thank God you came!
They were kidnapping me!\\
342 - Oh, shut up! That's
it. I have had it!\\
343 - You know what this means?\\
344 - More discipline.\\
345 - No. No.\\
346 - Oh, yes.
Playtime is over.\\
347 - Oh, stop saying that.\\
348 - Your cracking down
is not working.\\
349 - Hell, I could
have told him that a week ago.\\
350 - Now is not the time
to be a porky mouth.\\
351 - Red, I want my house back.\\
352 - Once had an ant farm...\\
353 - Oh, honey, no.
Not now.\\
354 - Okay. Okay. Here's
what we're gonna do.\\
355 - You are going to remember
that he's a good son,\\
356 - and you are going to
remember that he's a good father,\\
357 - because I am not happy with
the way this house is running.\\
358 - Hah! Now you see
what you've done?\\
359 - You've made your mother unhappy.\\
360 - No, he didn't.\\
361 - I'm not happy with everything.\\
362 - I'm not happy with
windows being nailed shut,\\
363 - and I'm not happy with
people sneaking around,\\
364 - and I'm not happy\\
365 - with my Christmas
bells on the front door.\\
366 - Well, Kitty, what do
you want me to do?\\
367 - Pretend that nothing happened?\\
368 - Yes.\\
369 - No!\\
370 - Fine!
Then that's it.\\
371 - Then I'm staying home.\\
372 - I'm staying home full-time\\
373 - and I am taking back my house,\\
374 - and that's the way it is.\\
375 - Now, you get upstairs\\
376 - and take those nails
out of the windows\\
377 - and you,\\
378 - stop being such
a sneaky smart mouth\\
379 - and you... honey!\\
380 - You've got to stop
eating stuff off the floor.\\
381 - Now, everyone, let's
go back to happy!\\
382 - Ha-ha-ha!\\
383 - So, I guess playtime is over.\\
384 - I'm sorry, dad.\\
385 - I don't remember
growing older\\
386 - When did they?\\
387 - Sunrise\\
388 - Sunset\\
389 - Sunrise\\
390 - Sunset\\
391 - Swiftly fly the years\\
392 - One season
following another\\
393 - Laden with happiness
and tears\\
394 - Give it to me
one more time, coochie!
\subsection {Episode 03: Hyde's Father}
1 - All right! They didn't
even check our fake IDs.\\
2 - And I wasted a whole day
thinking up my fake name.\\
3 - Yeah. Sorry, Pez.\\
4 - Let's drink.\\
5 - - So, fellas,
school let out early?
- Yeah, we're just...\\
6 - - Kelso, shut up.
- I mean, no.\\
7 - No, we're old.\\
8 - We're workers. We're
all construction workers.\\
9 - Hey, fellas,
did you see that brick today?\\
10 - Whoo!\\
11 - Relax, guys.\\
12 - It's Serve a Minor Night at the old
Don't-Have-a-Liquor-License Saloon.\\
13 - You look familiar.
Do I know you?\\
14 - I should hope so, Dad.\\
15 - Hanging out\\
16 - Down the street\\
17 - The same old thing\\
18 - We did last week\\
19 - Not a thing to do\\
20 - But talk to you\\
21 - We're all all right\\
22 - We're all all right\\
23 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
24 - Hey! Steven!\\
25 - Wow! So you're Hyde's dad.\\
26 - Well, that's what
his mother says.\\
27 - Kidding.\\
28 - Hello, Mr. Hyde's Dad.
I am Pez.\\
29 - - I've heard much about you.
- Good things, I hope.\\
30 - Well, if running out
on your family\\
31 - and becoming
a drunk is good, then yes.\\
32 - Okay, guys.
Let's look over here.\\
33 - Wow!\\
34 - Look at you!\\
35 - You're bigger.\\
36 - And you got your mom's hair\\
37 - and her sideburns.\\
38 - - So how long has it been?
- Eight years, 51 days.\\
39 - Wow!\\
40 - - Time really
flies when you're...
- Drunk?\\
41 - I was gonna say "having fun",
but same thing.\\
42 - Yeah, so,
how long you been back for?\\
43 - Well, let's see.
That must be about a year.\\
44 - - A year?
- Yeah. Hey, I was
gonna call you, but...\\
45 - You were gonna call me?
Oh, man, that makes you, like...\\
46 - I don't know, what,
Father of the Year?\\
47 - I'll see you around, Dad.\\
48 - Oh, man, Hyde's upset.
Better go see how he is.\\
49 - Yep. One more round,
we'll go see how he is.\\
50 - Hello!\\
51 - She is just my type, naked.\\
52 - I, too, like the naked ladies.\\
53 - I find them so\\
54 - naked.\\
55 - Yeah, that's realistic.\\
56 - I think I'm gonna change
the oil in my car,\\
57 - but first, I'm gonna take off
everything but my cowboy boots!\\
58 - Well, sure. I mean, if you're in
bare feet, you could slip in the oil.\\
59 - Come on, Donna.
Safety first.\\
60 - Whoa!\\
61 - "Surefire Ways
To Pick Up Women."\\
62 - What kind of lonely losers
read this stuff, anyway?\\
63 - Give me.\\
64 - "Look deep into her eyes
and use her name often,\\
65 - "showing that this
conversation is just for her."\\
66 - Ahem. Hey, Donna.\\
67 - I think they're onto something,
Donna. What do you think, Donna?\\
68 - Oh, my God. I'm taking off
my shirt. Stop it, hands! Stop it!\\
69 - Well, Steven, honey, you
haven't touched your sandwich.\\
70 - - You feel okay?
- Yeah. I'm just not hungry.\\
71 - Oh, Steven, are you finally
tired of freeloading?\\
72 - Can it, Laurie.\\
73 - All I'm saying is Daddy works
really hard and nothing here is cheap.\\
74 - Except you.\\
75 - Believe me, I'm not cheap.\\
76 - Fine. Free. Whatever.\\
77 - Hey, honey, I'm home.\\
78 - Oh, good. The hippie's here.\\
79 - Hyde, man, your dad come by
looking for you, man,\\
80 - which is really freaky, 'cause I
thought this bald dude was your dad.\\
81 - Thanks, Leo.\\
82 - Steven's father is in town?\\
83 - Yeah, right. Like he even
knows who his father is.\\
84 - Eric, you know
something about this?\\
85 - She's a bitch.\\
86 - Right, okay, uh, yeah.\\
87 - We bumped into
Hyde's dad last night.\\
88 - He'd been back in town,
like, a year.\\
89 - Hadn't even talked
to his own son.\\
90 - Cool egg salad, man.\\
91 - Well, I'm gonna talk to Steven\\
92 - and see how he's
feeling about this.\\
93 - You know what, Mom?
I wouldn't do that.\\
94 - Hyde really likes to
bottle those things up.\\
95 - Good for him. That's where
those feelings should be kept.\\
96 - Well, what is he gonna do?
Pretend he doesn't have a father?\\
97 - Kitty, this is a family issue,\\
98 - and for once,
it's not about our family.\\
99 - Look, the bond
between a father and a son\\
100 - is complex and subtle.\\
101 - You wipe that damn
smirk off your face!\\
102 - Red, when we took that boy
into our home,\\
103 - it became our job to see
him through thick and thin,\\
104 - and now it's thick.\\
105 - Or thin. I don't know,
but he needs us.\\
106 - Cool egg salad, man.\\
107 - Fine. Stick your nose in where
it doesn't belong. Go ahead.\\
108 - Okay, will do.\\
109 - Bud's coming over
for drinks tonight.\\
110 - Mom, do you really want to invite
an alcoholic over for cocktails?\\
111 - Oh, right.
Okay, well, I'll just, um...\\
112 - I'll make him
a nice Shirley Temple\\
113 - and he can fill up on cheese.\\
114 - You keep a stack of dirty
magazines under your bed?\\
115 - What? No!
God, not a stack.\\
116 - You know,
what is a "stack", really?\\
117 - - Why do you have
these down here?
- Now, wait, Donna.\\
118 - Downstairs, you were laughing
and cracking jokes about this stuff.\\
119 - Eric, that was in the basement\\
120 - with our idiotic friends.\\
121 - Why do you need them?
Aren't I enough?\\
122 - No. Yeah, oh, you're
enough. God, you're plenty.\\
123 - It's just, uh...\\
124 - You see, Donna, you see,
what I do with dirty magazines is\\
125 - really only interesting to me.\\
126 - With the reading of the articles\\
127 - and the, you know, solving
of the puzzles and whatnot.\\
128 - You know what? I don't
wanna know about the "whatnot".\\
129 - I'm out of here.\\
130 - Oh, no, girls.\\
131 - She's onto us.\\
132 - Hello, Jackie.
How are you, Jackie?\\
133 - - Fine.
- I'm glad, Jackie.\\
134 - I, too, am fine, Jackie.\\
135 - Do I have a sty?\\
136 - No, Jackie. You,
Jackie, do not have a sty.\\
137 - Jackie.\\
138 - Okay, Fez.\\
139 - I don't know what
you're doing, Fez,\\
140 - but stop doing it, Fez.\\
141 - Oh, no.
Now I am turned on.\\
142 - Oh, wow, man.\\
143 - Look at all these different
nuts intermingling in one bowl.\\
144 - It's like Nutstock, man.\\
145 - Kitty,\\
146 - I think we should rethink our "Don't
Throw Leo Out On His Ass" policy.\\
147 - No, no. Leo stuck around
because he cares about Steven.\\
148 - And, plus,
I can't find my shoes, man.\\
149 - - Hey. What's going on?
- Oh, good news, Steven.\\
150 - - Your dad's
coming over tonight.
- Screw that!\\
151 - No, Steven,
it's a good thing, I think.\\
152 - - I got nothing to say to him!
- Well, we have fancy nut mix.\\
153 - Hey, Red!
Remember me?\\
154 - Of course. I wasn't the
one passed out in the gutter.\\
155 - Yeah, I had this weird condition\\
156 - where I'd drink a case
of beer and fall down.\\
157 - Hey, Red.
Man, you're looking good.\\
158 - Have you lost hair?\\
159 - Steven will be right out.\\
160 - Hey, man, nice shoes.\\
161 - Are those mine?\\
162 - - Hello, Bud.
- Hi.\\
163 - - Can I go now?
- It's "May I go", and no.\\
164 - So, Bud,\\
165 - can I get you a drink?\\
166 - A drink!
A drink of soda.\\
167 - A nice drink of soda, Bud.
Plus, we have cheese.\\
168 - Soda sounds great, Kitty.\\
169 - - Yeah, I'm off the hooch.
- Oh, really?\\
170 - So, no more boozing.\\
171 - I heard him.\\
172 - Yeah.
I can finally see clearly.\\
173 - Isn't it great, man?\\
174 - It is.\\
175 - I got a job and an
apartment. Color TV.\\
176 - Ooh, color TV.
That's nice.\\
177 - Wow, Bud, doing great now, huh?\\
178 - Color TV? Man.\\
179 - I remember when I was a kid,
I didn't even have a father.\\
180 - Well, well.\\
181 - Who could have
foreseen this terrible...\\
182 - Can it!\\
183 - Jackie didn't give me
the time of the day.\\
184 - I hate this stupid magazine.\\
185 - Oh, no, I didn't
mean it. I love you.\\
186 - Hey, Fez. Check this out.\\
187 - "Tight pants turn a man's
derriere into a lady's dream.\\
188 - "And an open shirt
shows a sexy chest\\
189 - "and an irresistible
joie de vivre."\\
190 - Really?\\
191 - I always thought my joie
de vivre was in my pants.\\
192 - Okay, I can't believe
I'm asking you guys this,\\
193 - but if any of you losers
had a girlfriend,\\
194 - would you still look
at those magazines?\\
195 - Hey, I had two girlfriends\\
196 - and a little action on the side\\
197 - and I still looked
at those magazines.\\
198 - You had action on the side?
Who?\\
199 - You don't know her.
She went to Sacred Heart.\\
200 - Okay. Anybody here have an
opinion who's not a skeevy pig?\\
201 - I'm glad you asked, Donna.\\
202 - If I had Jackie, I would
never look at those magazines.\\
203 - Unless she's on the phone\\
204 - or went shopping
or took a short nap.\\
205 - Look, Donna.\\
206 - This is just
the way guys are, okay?\\
207 - I mean, if Forman was actually
dating the "Naughty Campus Co-eds",\\
208 - he'd be locked in a bathroom,
looking at naked pictures of you.\\
209 - He's right, so...\\
210 - Are there naked pictures of you?\\
211 - My leg!\\
212 - Hey, knee him in the groin!\\
213 - Oh, my God!
She did it!\\
214 - So how's your cocoa?\\
215 - Chocolatey good, thanks.\\
216 - That's good, 'cause I think
your father has really changed.\\
217 - He is not the same man
I used to know,\\
218 - and the marshmallows
make it extra good.\\
219 - Well, at least you knew him,
Mrs. Forman, 'cause I never did.\\
220 - Okay, well, here's your chance.\\
221 - Maybe now you can make
some new, happy memories.\\
222 - Wouldn't that be wonderful?\\
223 - Oh! Hey!\\
224 - Yeah!\\
225 - Yeah, you know what,
Mrs. Forman?\\
226 - No.\\
227 - Are you sure? 'Cause I kind of
think you're bottling things up.\\
228 - I'm not bottling anything!\\
229 - Well, hi there, beautiful.
And how are you?\\
230 - Not good, you dirtbag.\\
231 - That's what I thought you'd...\\
232 - Excuse me?\\
233 - I am not going to help you
cheat on your girlfriend.\\
234 - But I don't have a girlfriend,
you\\
235 - silly librarian.\\
236 - Don't you lie to me.
I heard everything.\\
237 - I was right under that mattress.\\
238 - And that Donna
sounded really upset.\\
239 - No! No, no,
she's okay. Really.\\
240 - Excuse me.\\
241 - My turnoffs
include unfaithful men.\\
242 - Didn't you read my biography?\\
243 - Um. I...\\
244 - You know,
I was just getting to it.\\
245 - Sorry, but Donna is a nice girl\\
246 - and you are a filthy,
filthy boy!\\
247 - You filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy, filthy,\\
248 - filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy, filthy boy!\\
249 - Hey. You can't ditch me then walk
back into my life eight years later\\
250 - and expect
everything to be okay.\\
251 - - You screwed me!
- I did. You're right. I know.\\
252 - And...\\
253 - You what? You know?
What do you mean, you know?\\
254 - I got no excuse.
I was a jerk.\\
255 - I've been a jerk my whole life.\\
256 - And all I can do is
tell you I'm sorry\\
257 - and hope that you'll believe me.\\
258 - You jerk! How am I
supposed to yell at you now?\\
259 - I was gonna yell!
I was gonna tell you off!\\
260 - I think you should. I mean,
you wanna yell? Go ahead.\\
261 - - I deserve it.
- You're just... You're caving?\\
262 - That just makes it worse!\\
263 - Come on, man!
Give me something!\\
264 - - You want a beer?
- Yeah!\\
265 - Give me a beer!\\
266 - - Well, hello, Jackie.
- Hey, Fez.\\
267 - Hey, Fez.\\
268 - Nice ass!\\
269 - Why, thank you, Kelso.\\
270 - Oh, my God.
What the hell's that smell?\\
271 - Well, Jackie,
it's a combination of musk\\
272 - and a little thing
I like to call "Fez."\\
273 - Whoa, Fez!
What are you doing?\\
274 - Showing off my joie de vivre.\\
275 - - You like?
- No!\\
276 - So, what?
This was all a waste?\\
277 - The pants, the chest,
the manly smell,\\
278 - the "Jackie, hello, Jackie, Jackie,
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie"?\\
279 - Worthless?\\
280 - Not worthless, hilarious.\\
281 - Okay. Look, Fez,
you're not bad-looking.\\
282 - I mean, some girls like
that exotic, grimy look.\\
283 - But only the cheapest, most
sluttiest girls will like that.\\
284 - I see.\\
285 - Damn, Fez!\\
286 - Looking good.\\
287 - Hey, so, thanks for the
singles at the nudie bar.\\
288 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
289 - - You gotta tip the girls
or they ignore you.
- Yeah.\\
290 - So, they taking care
of you here?\\
291 - Yeah, yeah.
It's good. It's great.\\
292 - - It's a nice place.
- Oh, yeah.\\
293 - That's nice.\\
294 - I like my place, too.
It's good.\\
295 - It's got an extra room.\\
296 - - That's cool.
- Yeah.\\
297 - So, if you ever wanna, you know,
come by or whatever, you know,\\
298 - I'm not using the extra room.\\
299 - Hence the term "extra room".\\
300 - Yeah. Yeah,
the rent's due,\\
301 - but they don't evict you
for, like, three months,\\
302 - so I still got two days.\\
303 - So, you looking for a loan, Bud?\\
304 - Well, will you look at that?\\
305 - A father and son
brought together by...\\
306 - Oh, my goodness!
I think it was me!\\
307 - Don't gloat, Kitty.\\
308 - Mr. Wrongie!\\
309 - Fine.\\
310 - Once in 26 years!\\
311 - Live it up, Kitty!\\
312 - Oh, crap.\\
313 - Ta-da!\\
314 - Wow, Eric.
It's a room.\\
315 - Not just any room. See?\\
316 - No more dirty magazines.
I threw them all out.\\
317 - And you know what, Donna?
I don't miss them.\\
318 - Eric, you didn't
have to do that.\\
319 - I mean, I understand
why you need them.\\
320 - - You do?
- Yes! You're disgusting!\\
321 - - What?
- It's okay.\\
322 - All guys are.
You're a revolting gender.\\
323 - You know, we really are.\\
324 - But you're disgusting
in a cute, harmless way,\\
325 - and I guess I love you for that.\\
326 - I love you, too.\\
327 - Well, let me make it up to you.\\
328 - I could have a naked
girl in here in 10 seconds.\\
329 - - Oh, great. Send her in. I'll see you later.
- Shut up!\\
330 - Steven, good. I wanted
to have a talk with you.\\
331 - What are you doing?\\
332 - Oh.\\
333 - I'm moving in with Bud.\\
334 - You're moving in with Bud?\\
335 - Yeah, Red.
It's gonna be okay.\\
336 - No, it's not gonna be okay.\\
337 - Steven, your dad is not...\\
338 - Good.\\
339 - Yeah. I know,
but, you know, he's my dad.\\
340 - - Yeah. He's your dad.
- Yeah.\\
341 - Anyway. Red, thanks for
everything. You know, really.\\
342 - Hey, do me a favor.
Would you tell Mrs. Forman?\\
343 - 'Cause I don't wanna have to deal
with the whole crying thing, and...\\
344 - What, you think I do?\\
345 - No, I'll just tell her
that, you know...\\
346 - Anytime you need a place
to stay, you're welcome here.\\
347 - - That'll make her feel better.
- Yeah. That sounds good. Thanks.\\
348 - Ahem. So, what, uh, you
don't want a hug, do you?\\
349 - - God, no.
- Good.\\
350 - - 'Cause you're
not getting one.
- All right.\\
351 - Well, sis-boom-bah.\\
352 - Sure this is okay?\\
353 - Oh, yeah, yeah.
Before you got here,\\
354 - I got the thumbs-up from
the old ball and chain.\\
355 - She's great.
You'd like her.\\
356 - Oh.\\
357 - Well, if she's so great,
are you sure you need me?\\
358 - Look, I've been over this
again and again and again.\\
359 - And yes, I do.\\
360 - Okay.\\
361 - Well, yay, team.
\subsection {Episode 04: Too Old to Trick or Treat, Too Young to Die}
1 - And now back to the
Hitchcock Halloween Movie Marathon.\\
2 - Boo!\\
3 - Damn it, Fez!\\
4 - Oh! Damn, Fez!\\
5 - What the hell are you doing?\\
6 - I don't know if you know this,\\
7 - but you're dressed
like a girl...\\
8 - And not a nice girl.\\
9 - Kelso, you spilled juice
all over your shirt.\\
10 - You look stupid.\\
11 - Yeah, hey, Kelso,
while you're over there,\\
12 - would you please, please
toss Fez a pair of pants?\\
13 - Or at least a skirt.\\
14 - No, I am Dr. Frank-N-Furter\\
15 - from The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.\\
16 - You know, my
Bible-thumping host parents\\
17 - were really upset
about my rock-hard ass.\\
18 - Fez, put it away
or take it outside.\\
19 - So, Eric, do you want
to get out of here,\\
20 - do something fun for Halloween?\\
21 - I do!\\
22 - I've got to go to
this stupid Halloween party\\
23 - with Laurie's stupid friends.\\
24 - Not only do I have
to wear a suit,\\
25 - but all of her guy friends\\
26 - act like they've
done it with her before.\\
27 - Uh, Kelso...\\
28 - Leave it.
Okay.\\
29 - Whatever.
There's nothing to do.\\
30 - It's like we're too old
to trick or treat,\\
31 - and too young to die.\\
32 - Oh, hey, we could
take Fez to Chicago\\
33 - and peddle his ass for beer.\\
34 - I'm game.\\
35 - Eric, I meant maybe
there's something,\\
36 - you know, we could do...
Together.\\
37 - I doubt it.\\
38 - Oh!\\
39 - That is a burn!\\
40 - Wait. What?\\
41 - No. I... No, I didn't
mean it like that.\\
42 - Nope. Sorry, Eric.
That was a burn.\\
43 - And what's burnt is burnt.\\
44 - And what's burnt is Donna.\\
45 - Oh, so we're out
of fun things to do?\\
46 - You're already bored
of your girlfriend?\\
47 - No. I meant
this town,\\
48 - not you, pretty lady.\\
49 - You know what would be fun?\\
50 - Is if we were in an Alfred
Hitchcock movie right now,\\
51 - and we didn't know it,\\
52 - and then someone told us,
and we were like,\\
53 - "Oh, man,
I'm in a movie!"\\
54 - Yeah, okay.
I'm out of here.\\
55 - Wait. But I thought
we were...\\
56 - Get bent!
Okay, I'll do that.\\
57 - You know what will cheer you up?\\
58 - A little trick-or-treating.\\
59 - Hello? Stop bouncing
that damn ball\\
60 - and let's do something.\\
61 - Yeah, you know, I can't, Fez,\\
62 - 'cause I can't even look at you.\\
63 - I don't know whether
to throw you out\\
64 - or throw you down and
make sweet love to you.\\
65 - You know, that says more
about you than it does him.\\
66 - Well, I'm not the one
dressed like a damn girl.\\
67 - But the damn girl has your ball.\\
68 - Like I care about a...\\
69 - Man, that's my ball.\\
70 - Oh, these heels are killing me.\\
71 - Okay, Fez, that's it.\\
72 - Give the ball back,
and no one gets hurt.\\
73 - Hey, you guys,
you want to go outside\\
74 - and watch Eric
and Fez run around?\\
75 - Someone might get hurt.\\
76 - It's funny when people get hurt.\\
77 - Especially when they're
in their underwear.\\
78 - That's great.\\
79 - The only person dumb enough
to get hurt around here is you.\\
80 - Okay, Jackie,\\
81 - I'm really starting
to get sick... Ow!\\
82 - I'll give you the ball, Eric.\\
83 - Just don't fall.\\
84 - I don't want anyone
to fall. No falling.\\
85 - Hangin' out\\
86 - Down the street\\
87 - The same old thing\\
88 - We did last week\\
89 - Not a thing to do\\
90 - But talk to you\\
91 - We're all all right\\
92 - We're all all right\\
93 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
94 - Okay, Fez.\\
95 - Well, you got a bad sprain here,\\
96 - and not to mention a run
in your stocking.\\
97 - So, you were running around,
chasing him on the roof\\
98 - because he took
your little rubber ball.\\
99 - That wasn't a ball.\\
100 - It was a Super Ball.\\
101 - Yeah, you should see
that thing bounce.\\
102 - It's pretty super.\\
103 - Dumb asses.\\
104 - Um, get Fez a blanket.\\
105 - He needs to cover his...
His...\\
106 - He just... He needs
to cover up.\\
107 - Get off me, you girl.\\
108 - What...\\
109 - What happened?\\
110 - Honey, you just had a
little touch of vertigo there,\\
111 - so just stay away
from heights for a while,\\
112 - and you'll be fine.\\
113 - Oh, see?\\
114 - You see that, Jackie?
Fez hurt himself.\\
115 - There is someone
stupider than me.\\
116 - Look, it's not his fault
he's stupid.\\
117 - He's foreign.\\
118 - What's your excuse, stupid?\\
119 - Well, I know
one thing's for sure.\\
120 - There's definitely
someone bitchier than me.\\
121 - Oh, you better not mean me.\\
122 - Oh, I so mean you!\\
123 - Nice burn.
Top shelf.\\
124 - Thanks.\\
125 - Well, now, that's strange.\\
126 - Midge's car is right there.\\
127 - Bob said she wasn't home.\\
128 - In fact, I haven't
seen her for days.\\
129 - Maybe she went to the store\\
130 - and forgot where she lived.\\
131 - Oh, that's...
That's wrong.\\
132 - Okay, Fez.
This'll cheer you up.\\
133 - With these, you can look
into the Pinciotti's house\\
134 - and frequently enjoy
a naked Midge,\\
135 - up close and personal.\\
136 - That's exactly how
I like my naked Midges.\\
137 - Oh, but, Fez, be warned.\\
138 - If Bob approaches naked Midge,\\
139 - look away.\\
140 - Oh, for the love
of God, look away.\\
141 - Okay, let's practice.\\
142 - Naked Midge, naked Midge,\\
143 - naked Midge, naked Midge, Bob!\\
144 - I think you're gonna be okay.\\
145 - No. Okay. Sure.\\
146 - Yeah. Bye-bye.\\
147 - Red, I need you to
take this soup up to Fez.\\
148 - No, Kitty.\\
149 - He's wearing ladies' underwear,\\
150 - so, uh, no.\\
151 - Well, crazy bird lady
from next door called me.\\
152 - Her bingo cruise got stuck
out on Lake Michigan,\\
153 - so she asked me
to feed her birds.\\
154 - So you have a choice,\\
155 - feed the birds or feed the Fez.\\
156 - Give me panty boy's damn soup.\\
157 - Hello, pretty birds.\\
158 - Hello, pretty damn big birds.\\
159 - It's your Aunt Kitty.\\
160 - Okay.\\
161 - Hey.\\
162 - Oh, I've seen this one.\\
163 - See, those guys think that
Cary Grant's a secret agent,\\
164 - but he's not.\\
165 - It's a case of
mistaken identity.\\
166 - Like you've mistaken me\\
167 - for someone who wants you here.\\
168 - Right.\\
169 - Wait.\\
170 - Oh, kick back.
I'll get it.\\
171 - No, it's the paperboy.\\
172 - Well, Mr. Forman, you
have to answer the door.\\
173 - Look. I forgot
to pay him\\
174 - for the last couple of weeks,\\
175 - and I didn't pick up any cash,\\
176 - so just ignore it.\\
177 - Red, I don't think
you understand, okay?\\
178 - I can't let a doorbell go unanswered.\\
179 - Don't answer the damn door!\\
180 - I gotta!
Don't!\\
181 - But I gotta!
All right. Fine!\\
182 - You pay him, kettlehead.\\
183 - Hey, Forman, I want my money.\\
184 - Oh, uh...
Oh, there's no Formans here.\\
185 - See for yourself.\\
186 - Then why does it say
"Forman" on your shirt?\\
187 - Oh, I borrowed the shirt.\\
188 - That's a bunch
of bullcorn, Forman!\\
189 - Now give me my money.\\
190 - I'm not Forman, okay?\\
191 - Look, don't you think you're
taking this paperboy thing\\
192 - a little too serious?\\
193 - I'm a very serious paperboy.\\
194 - Okay, you know what this is?\\
195 - This is a case
of mistaken identity.\\
196 - See, you are mistaken\\
197 - about my identity.\\
198 - Fork it over, Forman!\\
199 - Look, someone's
stealing your bike.\\
200 - All right. There's two
guys stupider than me.\\
201 - Hey.
Hey.\\
202 - Any sign of naked Midge yet?\\
203 - No. Just Bob dragging in
big, heavy garbage bags.\\
204 - What do you suppose is in them?\\
205 - Oh, I don't know.\\
206 - Guessing garbage.\\
207 - Or... You know
how Mrs. Kitty\\
208 - said she hasn't seen
Midge in a few days?\\
209 - What if naked Midge
is in the bags?\\
210 - Red. Red,
I killed a bird.\\
211 - Aw.\\
212 - And then... And then
the rest of them, they just...\\
213 - They glared at me with this...\\
214 - This birdie hate look.\\
215 - I can't go back there.\\
216 - I have got to find somebody
else to feed those birds,\\
217 - somebody who won't flinch
in the face of evil.\\
218 - Oh, and there's Mommy's girl.\\
219 - Laurie, have I got
a job for you.\\
220 - Not interested.\\
221 - It pays 10 bucks.\\
222 - All right. I'll do anything
for 10 bucks.\\
223 - And... And for once,
that's a good thing.\\
224 - Donna, what's wrong?\\
225 - You look sad.\\
226 - I think Eric thinks I'm boring.\\
227 - Do you think I'm boring?\\
228 - Yeah, a little.\\
229 - But it's not like
it's a bad thing.\\
230 - The world needs people like you.\\
231 - You're the gray that
makes the color, me, pop!\\
232 - Jackie, I'm not boring.\\
233 - Eric and I do lots
of fun stuff together.\\
234 - We go to movies...\\
235 - Every Friday, early show.\\
236 - What? I get sleepy.\\
237 - Oh, no.\\
238 - Boring,
boring, boring!\\
239 - Boring, boring, boring!\\
240 - Hey, it's the hot blonde.\\
241 - That's not a hot blonde.
It's Donna.\\
242 - Where is she going?\\
243 - Maybe she's going trolling
for men who don't piss her off.\\
244 - Oh.
That's so funny, Hyde.\\
245 - I don't know where she's going.\\
246 - But I'm gonna follow her.\\
247 - Would you stop doing that?\\
248 - Hey, I don't know how this
fits in your murder theory,\\
249 - but Bob's wearing an apron
with guts all over it\\
250 - and holding a big carving knife.\\
251 - He did kill Midge.\\
252 - And I never got
to see her naked!\\
253 - That's $2.50,
plus 50 cent tip,\\
254 - 'cause I'm good!\\
255 - See you next week, Forman.\\
256 - I'm not Forman!\\
257 - First of all, Mrs. Forman,\\
258 - I'm using your shower.\\
259 - And second of all,\\
260 - you have to pay your paperboy!\\
261 - So how'd it go?
Did you feed the birds?\\
262 - Uh, yeah.\\
263 - I mean, I think I did.\\
264 - Well, either you did
or you didn't.\\
265 - Well, you didn't, either,\\
266 - and you didn't even
get pooped on!\\
267 - Now go feed your own
stupid birds!\\
268 - Oh, Hyde,
please be careful.\\
269 - I want you to catch some clues.\\
270 - I don't want you stuck
in the garbage bag\\
271 - with dead, naked Midge.\\
272 - Cold beers.\\
273 - Hyde is so funny.\\
274 - Oh, what is he going to do?
Is he going to moon me?\\
275 - Oh, run, Hyde, run!\\
276 - Don't forget the beers.\\
277 - Please.\\
278 - Why are you in my bathroom?
Get out, out, out!\\
279 - I need the shower!
I got pooped on!\\
280 - All right, stop it.
Cut it out!\\
281 - That's really hot!\\
282 - Oh, my God, you spilled
my shampoo, you idiot!\\
283 - Help.\\
284 - You can't kill me like you
killed Midge, you big doofy.\\
285 - Midge?
I didn't kill Midge.\\
286 - She's in Chicago
visiting her sister.\\
287 - Oh, really? Then what was in
the heavy garbage sacks?\\
288 - Garbage, you idiot.\\
289 - Oh, well, I guess that
explains the giant knife,\\
290 - guts all over your apron.\\
291 - Oh, wait. No, it doesn't.\\
292 - Explain that, killer.\\
293 - They were pumpkin guts.\\
294 - I was making jack-o'-lanterns.\\
295 - So, you're hiding Midge's body
in a jack-o'-lantern.\\
296 - Clever plan.\\
297 - Look, there's Midge now,
not dead or nothing.\\
298 - Oh, goody.
You can go now. Thanks.\\
299 - Midgie, no!
Cover yourself!\\
300 - Ow.\\
301 - Give it, give it!\\
302 - Donna, Donna!\\
303 - Why would she go up
the water tower?\\
304 - Why does she wanna be up there?\\
305 - And why am I talking to myself?\\
306 - I have to...\\
307 - ...climb.\\
308 - Donna.\\
309 - What the hell are you doing?\\
310 - Well, I guess you've caught me.\\
311 - And if you must know the truth,\\
312 - I'm not boring, you ass.\\
313 - I never said you were boring.\\
314 - How'd you know
I'd follow you here?\\
315 - I saw you spying on me.\\
316 - I wasn't... No, I
wasn't spying on you.\\
317 - I was teaching Fez how to spy
on your naked...\\
318 - Yeah, you know what?
I was spying on you.\\
319 - Weird night.\\
320 - Please, Donna,\\
321 - tell me there's not a head
in that basket.\\
322 - No, no.
It's just a picnic.\\
323 - So...\\
324 - So we're okay?\\
325 - Ow, you're on my wig.\\
326 - Oh, God!
I'm gonna die!\\
327 - Eric, hold on.
I'm gonna pull you up.\\
328 - No, Donna, you can't do it.
You're just a girl.\\
329 - Okay, whoa. Okay.\\
330 - Okay. It's okay,
you got it. That's...\\
331 - You know, it was never really...\\
332 - Ow.\\
333 - Oh, my goodness.
A phone booth.\\
334 - That's lucky.\\
335 - Oh, thank God.
It was just a dream.\\
336 - Well, I can't go back there.
I just can't.\\
337 - So, you know, Donna, even
though my ankle's sprained,\\
338 - I can still probably
make it up that water tower.\\
339 - You know,\\
340 - finish what we started.\\
341 - I would, but I don't
know if I can.\\
342 - I mean, something
happened to me up there, too.\\
343 - Oh, I know. Vertigo, right?
Fear of heights.\\
344 - No, Eric.
Fear of sex!
\subsection {Episode 05: Roller Disco}
1 - Oh, don't put Batman in
the clam of death, Riddler.\\
2 - That's just gonna make him mad.\\
3 - God, you're stupid.\\
4 - Fez, for the last time,
the Riddler can't hear you.\\
5 - Riddle me this, Riddler.\\
6 - When Batman escapes
from the clam of death,\\
7 - who will kick your
riddle-telling ass in?\\
8 - Hey, Fez.
Riddle me this.\\
9 - Unh!\\
10 - Then riddle me this.\\
11 - Oh, but, Fez, only
if you riddle me this.\\
12 - Ow!\\
13 - Riddle me this,
you son of a bitch.\\
14 - - Oh, my God! Guess what!
- Stop, Fez.\\
15 - This could be important.\\
16 - You guys, the Roller Disco Doo-dah
is coming to Kenosha next Friday.\\
17 - Oh, my God! Guess what!\\
18 - See, now,
that's the kind of thing\\
19 - the judges really frown upon
during competition, Steven.\\
20 - - Excuse me?
- We're gonna be partners.\\
21 - Skating partners.\\
22 - Hey, how about instead you hit me in
the face with a wrench and I black out?\\
23 - Steven,\\
24 - this is not just a last chance
at roller disco.\\
25 - It's a last chance at love.\\
26 - Our love.\\
27 - Now, will you or will you
not skate with me?\\
28 - I would, Jackie.\\
29 - But seeing you there in your
cute little skating outfit, with all your\\
30 - tassels and sequins,
I might be tempted to\\
31 - push you down
a flight of stairs.\\
32 - All right.\\
33 - Jackie, what do you say,
you and me, roller disco?\\
34 - I mean, we used to have
some good moves, you know,\\
35 - like, when we did it. So...\\
36 - It would be like that, except
for with lights and skates.\\
37 - Okay. Um, first of all,
you make me sick.\\
38 - Okay. Second, you're lame
and you make me sick.\\
39 - Third, you make me sick\\
40 - and any one of these guys would be
a better partner than you, even Fez.\\
41 - Really? Then I am in.\\
42 - No, I didn't really
mean it, Fez.\\
43 - Oh, then I am out.\\
44 - Damn it. Let me in.\\
45 - Hanging out\\
46 - Down the street\\
47 - The same old thing\\
48 - We did last week\\
49 - Not a thing to do\\
50 - But talk to you\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - So who will Jackie choose
as her roller disco partner?\\
55 - Who, who, who?\\
56 - No freaking way.\\
57 - How very sad.
No one to disco with.\\
58 - Now, where did I
leave my potato chips?\\
59 - There they are.\\
60 - Look at that.\\
61 - I left my soda back on
the other side of the room.\\
62 - Refreshing.\\
63 - God, my arm is sore.\\
64 - - Wow, Fez.
- Oh, come on, Jackie!\\
65 - You're gonna pick him over me?
All right, watch this.\\
66 - Jackie, I'm just
a roller disco machine.\\
67 - I don't work for nobody but you.\\
68 - Okay. Okay, fine,
we'll be partners.\\
69 - But hear me now.
I want first prize.\\
70 - If I lose and some stupid,
spoiled rich girl wins, I'll scream.\\
71 - I am really hurt!\\
72 - - Hi, sweetie, how was work?
- Oh, pretty good\\
73 - except for the fact that Dad's getting
sued for firing a Price Mart employee.\\
74 - Okay. Well, good.
Have a cupcake.\\
75 - Mom, did you hear what I said?\\
76 - Uh-huh.\\
77 - And it's just so very
unpleasant, I'm ignoring it.\\
78 - So, have a cupcake.\\
79 - Earl is suing Dad for
wrongful termination.\\
80 - Earl? He didn't do his job.
He was always late.\\
81 - He was a complete dumb-ass.\\
82 - Person.\\
83 - Mom, you said "ass."\\
84 - Well, now so did you. Give me
back the cupcake, foul mouth.\\
85 - I can't even imagine
the mood your father's in.\\
86 - Actually, he doesn't know yet.
I got the news after he left.\\
87 - God, Dad is gonna freak. I don't
know how we're gonna tell him.\\
88 - - Tell me what?
- That, uh...\\
89 - Mom said the "ass" word.\\
90 - Well, now, actually, um...\\
91 - Red, um...\\
92 - You know, Mom, I got this one.\\
93 - Okay, everyone here
who's not being sued by Earl\\
94 - for wrongful termination
raise their hand.\\
95 - I don't get Jackie, man.\\
96 - I mean, picking Fez
over me? Me?\\
97 - I have the three
things that women want.\\
98 - I'm hot and I'm smart.\\
99 - That's two things, moron.\\
100 - No, it's three. I count hot
twice. I mean, come on.\\
101 - Kelso, who cares? It's a
stupid roller disco thing.\\
102 - Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's silly for me to be jealous.\\
103 - You're a good friend, Donna.\\
104 - Yeah. 'Cause when
you think about it,\\
105 - I mean, what does Fez
have going for him\\
106 - except an incredibly sexy
accent and an extremely hot body?\\
107 - Okay. Now you're being
a bad friend, Donna.\\
108 - I mean, come to think of it, if
Fez helps Jackie win a roller disco,\\
109 - she might rip his clothes off\\
110 - and have sex with him
right there on the rink.\\
111 - That's how hot he is.\\
112 - Bad friend, Donna! Bad!\\
113 - Oh, look at
this guy's complaint.\\
114 - "Red Forman was
habitually ill-tempered."\\
115 - Am I ill-tempered?\\
116 - No, sir.
You're like Mary Poppins.\\
117 - Okay, honey. Well, it says here
you have to go to the labor board.\\
118 - You know what, Red Forman,\\
119 - you have to go in there
and defend yourself.\\
120 - I'll defend myself.\\
121 - I'll go in there,
and I'll tell those morons\\
122 - that they're wasting my time
with this stupid crap!\\
123 - Or you could
control your temper.\\
124 - No offense, Mom,
but what's plan B?\\
125 - Hey, shut it, pal.\\
126 - Okay, now, see, that's the kind of
thing that's gonna get you in trouble.\\
127 - Now, when I get
really angry, I just...\\
128 - I laugh it off like this.\\
129 - See?\\
130 - Oh, jeez, Kitty, that'll
never work. That's dumb.\\
131 - Oh, my God. I think
Jackie and Fez are next.\\
132 - Look, there they are.\\
133 - Hey, the next contestants are
cheaters. The brown guy is a robot.\\
134 - Now, ladies and
gentlemen... DONNA: Robot? Shut up.\\
135 - ...please welcome to the rink
our last contestants of the evening,\\
136 - from Point Place, Wisconsin,
Jackie Burkhart\\
137 - and, uh...\\
138 - Jackie Burkhart's partner.\\
139 - Boo!\\
140 - This is so cool.\\
141 - Oh, my God. They're amazing.\\
142 - - Oh, did you see that? Fez just tripped.
- No, he didn't.\\
143 - The foreign guy tripped.
That's a deduction right there.\\
144 - - You're gonna lose!
- Kelso, shut up.\\
145 - That's it.
They're doing too well.\\
146 - - What the hell is that?
- It's my secret weapon.\\
147 - - A marble?
- Yep.\\
148 - I'm gonna chuck it
out there so they trip.\\
149 - You moron, it's one marble.\\
150 - - Give me that. Give me that!
- No. No!\\
151 - Workin' at
the car wash, yeah\\
152 - Come on
and sing it with me\\
153 - Car wash\\
154 - Sing it with
the feeling, now\\
155 - Car wash, yeah\\
156 - Come Sunday,
the work gets kinda hard\\
157 - And this ain't
no place to be\\
158 - If you planned on
bein' a star\\
159 - Let me tell you
it's always cool\\
160 - And the boss
don't mind sometimes\\
161 - If you act the fool\\
162 - At the car wash\\
163 - Whoa-oa-oa-oa\\
164 - Talkin' about
the car wash, yeah\\
165 - Come on, y'all,
and sing it for me\\
166 - Car wash\\
167 - Whoo hoo hoo\\
168 - Car wash, yeah\\
169 - Work and work\\
170 - Well, those cars never
seem to stop coming\\
171 - Work and work\\
172 - Keep those rags
and machines humming\\
173 - Boo!\\
174 - Boo!\\
175 - Boo!\\
176 - Boo!\\
177 - Boo!\\
178 - Whoo!\\
179 - Oh, no. They were good.\\
180 - I swallowed my marble.\\
181 - Boo!\\
182 - - Oh, my God. You guys were so great.
- I know. I know.\\
183 - And even when I almost tripped,\\
184 - my natural grace
totally saved us.\\
185 - Well, I saw plenty of mistakes
out there, especially from Fez.\\
186 - Shut your hole.\\
187 - Here come the scores.\\
188 - And the winner of Kenosha's
Annual Roller Disco Doo-dah is\\
189 - Jackie Burkhart and...\\
190 - - Oh, my God!
- ...friend.\\
191 - Fixed! Fixed!\\
192 - I can't believe it.
I'm so sorry I doubted you.\\
193 - You are my hero, my hunky,
sexy, foreign skating hero.\\
194 - And you are my spoiled,
whiny, skating princess.\\
195 - Oh, Fez, thank you.\\
196 - Yay! Champagne!\\
197 - Yay! Yay!\\
198 - Get off me!\\
199 - - Kelso, you booed us
the entire time.
- What?\\
200 - No, that was some rude guy.\\
201 - So I popped him one,
and then I was going...\\
202 - Ooh!\\
203 - Because I hurt my hand when
I popped the rude guy. So...\\
204 - You're welcome.\\
205 - You wanna kiss it?\\
206 - Let's go, Fez.\\
207 - Hmm. Come on, Kelso.
Look at the bright side.\\
208 - What's the bright side?\\
209 - The bright side
is there isn't one.\\
210 - Fez has Jackie, and you have
to squeeze out that marble.\\
211 - Now, Mr. Forman, at any point
did you ever berate Earl Arthur\\
212 - by calling him any of
the following names,\\
213 - candy ass, dumb ass, lazy ass...\\
214 - It just goes on like that.\\
215 - Well, that sounds like just
good-natured ribbing to me.\\
216 - Doesn't sound that way to me.\\
217 - Ahem.\\
218 - Are you calling me a liar?\\
219 - 'Cause it's funny if you are.\\
220 - Well, you know,
Eric worked with him too.\\
221 - Eric, tell him about Earl.\\
222 - Actually, I'd be more interested\\
223 - in hearing what Eric thinks
about working with you.\\
224 - - Eric?
- No. No, no, no.\\
225 - I'm here just to answer
questions about Earl.\\
226 - Old, dumb Earl.\\
227 - So, you know, you fire
away with the Earl questions.\\
228 - I think we know all we
need to know about Earl.\\
229 - Oh, then good. I'll just
step out then. Good.\\
230 - - This was good.
- No, no, no, no, no.\\
231 - Eric, just a few more questions.\\
232 - Is your father ever
unnecessarily angry?\\
233 - Unnecessarily angry.\\
234 - Well, you know, what does
"unnecessarily" mean\\
235 - really? I mean, my sister
likes to put salt on roast beef,\\
236 - but I think it's unnecessary.\\
237 - I mean, why cover up the
flavor of such a delicious meat?\\
238 - Just answer the question,
dumb ass.\\
239 - I mean...\\
240 - Good work, son.\\
241 - Oh, my God.
I love champagne.\\
242 - Yes. Was it any good?\\
243 - Great. Just great.\\
244 - Hey, Fez, I just made up a poem.\\
245 - Do you want to hear it?\\
246 - Okay.\\
247 - "There once was a guy named Fez\\
248 - "Who had a really cute butt!"\\
249 - Tah-dah!\\
250 - Well, I have to
say I don't hate it.\\
251 - Hey.\\
252 - Psst.\\
253 - Fezzie.\\
254 - Do you want to know a secret?\\
255 - If you try to kiss me right now,\\
256 - I probably wouldn't stop you.\\
257 - In fact, I'd probably let you
do more than that.\\
258 - Fez.\\
259 - Good God, man!
Don't do it. She is drunk.\\
260 - But, Batman, she is so hot.\\
261 - But she's drunk.
There is no honor in this.\\
262 - Screw honor.
Take her pants off.\\
263 - Ai!\\
264 - Riddler, nefarious fiend.
Don't do it, Fez. It's a trap.\\
265 - Riddle me this, Fez.\\
266 - Why would Jackie ask you
to make out with her\\
267 - if she didn't want you to?\\
268 - Seriously, he makes
an excellent point.\\
269 - It's the dastardly
alcohol talking.\\
270 - If you and Jackie get together,\\
271 - you want it to be real,
not like this.\\
272 - Honestly, I was rooting for you,\\
273 - but imaginary Batman
makes a lot of sense.\\
274 - Then riddle me this, what
does Batman knows about girls?\\
275 - Slides down a pole and lives
with a teenage boy. Enough said.\\
276 - Okay, now I have to say
advantage Riddler.\\
277 - What are you
trying to say, Riddler?\\
278 - I think you know
what I'm trying to say.\\
279 - Ooh-la-la.\\
280 - Oh, you want to go,
Question Dork?\\
281 - Oh, bring it on, Bat-wuss.\\
282 - So are you gonna kiss me, Fez?\\
283 - - No, I am sorry, Jackie.
- That's okay.\\
284 - You still have a very cute butt.\\
285 - Come on, Kelso.\\
286 - So Jackie likes Fez.
Big deal.\\
287 - You're going out with Laurie.\\
288 - I know.
It's just, you know,\\
289 - seeing her with another guy\\
290 - just made me remember all
the good times we had together\\
291 - and it just made me sad.\\
292 - Yeah. Come here.\\
293 - You know, Kelso,\\
294 - I guess underneath it all
you're kind of a good guy.\\
295 - Sometimes. Sort of.\\
296 - Things will work themselves out.\\
297 - Yeah, I know.\\
298 - What the hell are you doing?\\
299 - We can't fight these
feelings anymore, Donna.\\
300 - - What?
- What?\\
301 - We've been doing
this dance all night.\\
302 - And, oh, God,
I'm tired of dancing.\\
303 - You moron.\\
304 - Nobody likes a tease, Donna.\\
305 - I'm sorry. You're
not a tease. Come back.\\
306 - Tease!\\
307 - I'm sorry. Donna.\\
308 - I guess "violent"
is the wrong word.\\
309 - But, you know, it's
definitely some kind of rage.\\
310 - Although, I mean, you know,
Earl had it coming.\\
311 - I love you, Daddy.\\
312 - - Oh, hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Yeah.\\
313 - Hour and 10 minutes late.
I can only assume you're Earl.\\
314 - Yeah.\\
315 - So, um, sorry. My,
uh, dog got hit by, uh...\\
316 - A guy in a...\\
317 - - Car?
- Thanks, Red.\\
318 - - So, what'd I miss?
- You missed everything.\\
319 - Yeah, okay.
I'm not gonna lie.\\
320 - Mr. Forman, you scare
the living hell out of me.\\
321 - - No offense.
- None taken.\\
322 - That's kind of his thing.\\
323 - But, Earl, in light of your failure
to show up for your own hearing,\\
324 - we have no choice but to
rule in favor of Mr. Forman.\\
325 - - Yes, sir.
- Way to go, Dad.\\
326 - Damn dog.\\
327 - And, Mr. Forman, even though
this hearing did go your way today,\\
328 - in light of some of
your son's responses,\\
329 - I would strongly encourage you to
go to anger-management classes.\\
330 - Sure, I'll...\\
331 - I'll do that.\\
332 - Neat, anger management.\\
333 - That sounds like it could be
kind of fun, right?\\
334 - We won. Hey!\\
335 - You and me,
we're such a good team.\\
336 - We did it.
How about us, huh?\\
337 - Sticking it to the man.\\
338 - I'll see you at home.\\
339 - Wait. But, Dad, we...\\
340 - We drove here together.\\
341 - And then she fell asleep
and I stroke her hair.\\
342 - You did the right thing, Fez,
but a word of advice.\\
343 - Next time you tell the story,
you nailed her.\\
344 - Yeah, but, you know,
it's better you didn't\\
345 - 'cause scamming on
another guy's woman,\\
346 - that's totally
breaking the code.\\
347 - Donna told me what
you did, you dill-hole.\\
348 - No, she's lying.\\
349 - That's my nipple.\\
350 - Hello, buttercup.\\
351 - - Fez, you're drunk.
- Madam, I may be drunk,\\
352 - - but you should
have sex with me.
- That's crazy.\\
353 - But you have to, because
last night I made a big mistake.\\
354 - I don't even
remember last night.\\
355 - Ai.
\subsection {Episode 06: Eric's Panties}
1 - Kelso, what's with
the gym shorts?\\
2 - Oh.\\
3 - Something happened.
I had to take my pants off.\\
4 - Do you shave your legs?\\
5 - No. They're just
naturally smooth.\\
6 - Shut up!\\
7 - Not to worry, Kelso. The
Puberty Bunny will visit you soon.\\
8 - So, lab partner,\\
9 - I guess you and I are gonna be
spending a lot of time together now, huh?\\
10 - Yeah, Shelly.
And good thing, too,\\
11 - 'cause, you know, I just shouldn't
be alone around a Bunsen burner.\\
12 - That is so funny!\\
13 - Let me go tell my friends
you're driving me home.\\
14 - Looks like Shelly
has a thing for Forman.\\
15 - Yes, and Forman has
a thing for Shelly.\\
16 - And it's in his pants.\\
17 - Oh, good one, Fez.\\
18 - Watch. Shelly's
gonna invite you over\\
19 - to her house when
her folks aren't home.\\
20 - That's what slutty girls do.\\
21 - So, Eric, my parents
aren't home.\\
22 - Let's go to my house.\\
23 - Don't you have a girlfriend?\\
24 - Yeah. That's what's
great about it.\\
25 - See, maybe Donna
will get jealous,\\
26 - and her and Shelly
will wrestle over you.\\
27 - Kelso, that's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.\\
28 - Oh, yeah?
Think about it.\\
29 - He's mine!\\
30 - No, he's mine!\\
31 - I had him first!\\
32 - You're going down!\\
33 - Kelso, that's the smartest
thing I've ever heard.\\
34 - Hanging out\\
35 - Down the street\\
36 - The same old thing\\
37 - We did last week\\
38 - Not a thing to do\\
39 - But talk to you\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - We're all all right\\
42 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
43 - Are you sure you don't
want to study at my house?\\
44 - I mean, it's just
sitting there all empty.\\
45 - No, come on,
this place was made...\\
46 - This place was
made for studying!\\
47 - Well, okay.\\
48 - Hey, Eric.\\
49 - Hey, Shelly, look. It's my girlfriend,
Donna. Hi, girlfriend Donna.\\
50 - Hi, Donna.\\
51 - You know, Eric, we'll do this
later, when we can be alone.\\
52 - To study.
We were just studying.\\
53 - Eric, you gotta hear this.\\
54 - We were just studying!
Donna, that's all.\\
55 - Eric, I'm telling a story here.\\
56 - Kelso was running
through the cafeteria\\
57 - and there were these mashed
potatoes on the floor, and...\\
58 - She's just my lab partner,
so mellow out! God!\\
59 - Uh-huh. So Kelso
slips on the potatoes,\\
60 - slides into a pole with his legs
spread, totally racks himself\\
61 - and everybody starts throwing
their carrots and their cheese at him\\
62 - chanting, "Tater nuts!
Tater nuts!"\\
63 - It was awesome!\\
64 - So, wait.\\
65 - Even though I'm spending time
with Shelly, you're not jealous?\\
66 - I'm sorry, but you and Shelly?\\
67 - What does that mean?\\
68 - It means that she
can have anyone.\\
69 - And what does that mean?\\
70 - - You're sweet.
- Get off of me!\\
71 - Well, there's
the little patient.\\
72 - So how'd it go at the doctor's?\\
73 - Well, let me put it this way.\\
74 - If a horse is in good shape,
they say it's healthy as me.\\
75 - Uh-huh.\\
76 - And did they say something about\\
77 - your pants being
on fire, liar, liar?\\
78 - No.\\
79 - I just got off the phone
with Dr. Leggett.\\
80 - He said your blood pressure
is through the roof.\\
81 - Well, Kitty,
who are you gonna believe?\\
82 - Some quack doctor\\
83 - or the man who stood by you
while you delivered our children?\\
84 - Oh, you did not.
You went out for a sub.\\
85 - Red, from now on, I am
gonna make sure you eat right.\\
86 - No meat, no cheese and no beer.\\
87 - No beer? You...\\
88 - Ohh! Oh.\\
89 - That's it, Kitty!
You've killed me.\\
90 - I see the light.\\
91 - What's that, Lord? It's okay to
eat meat and beer and cheese?\\
92 - Okay, I'll tell her.\\
93 - What that's, Lord?\\
94 - Dry toast and oatmeal.
Will do.\\
95 - Man, Donna saw Shelly
practically living in my lap.\\
96 - How could she not be jealous?\\
97 - I'm hot.\\
98 - It's because you are decent,
good-hearted and pure.\\
99 - You know, a sissy.\\
100 - Forman, I think what we need
here is some input from Tater Nuts.\\
101 - Tater Nuts, what do
you think, Tater Nuts?\\
102 - Eric, this...\\
103 - Hey!
Stop calling me Tater Nuts!\\
104 - If Donna's not jealous,
I mean, it means,\\
105 - basically,
you're in the free and clear.\\
106 - She's giving you the okay
to cheat. You gotta cheat.\\
107 - Tater Nuts makes sense.\\
108 - Quit it!\\
109 - I mean, I could be with
Shelly right now if I wanted to.\\
110 - So why shouldn't I?\\
111 - Because then you would have two
women when some people have none!\\
112 - Forget it, Forman.
You're not a cheater.\\
113 - You know, a wise man
once said, "Know thyself."\\
114 - That man's name was Tater Nuts.\\
115 - I gotta be honest
with you guys. Okay, I...\\
116 - I do shave my legs.\\
117 - I just like the way it feels.\\
118 - No! Come on, now!\\
119 - Hey, Donna. Look, we're not
gonna be able to hang out tonight.\\
120 - I gotta go to
the library with Shelly.\\
121 - Okay, that's cool. We can
just hang out tomorrow night.\\
122 - No. Yeah, no.\\
123 - See, yeah, I'm gonna
have my hands full\\
124 - with this project
that's due in a few days,\\
125 - so I'll be off
alone with Shelly.\\
126 - She doesn't wear a bra,
you know.\\
127 - Yeah, whatever. Bye.\\
128 - Uh-oh.\\
129 - Farmhand got
a hold of the rich lady.\\
130 - Oh. Hi, kids.\\
131 - Your dad's not
really a farmhand.\\
132 - Yeah. It's just a little
intimacy game we're playing.\\
133 - - And it's fun!
- Yeah.\\
134 - I'm sorry you had to see that.\\
135 - I'm sorry I had to see that.\\
136 - Yeah, well, you know,
Shelly's waiting for me, so...\\
137 - Yeah, Eric, you said that.\\
138 - Okay, bye.\\
139 - He usually gives
me a kiss goodbye.\\
140 - Yeah. To be honest,
it kind of grosses me out.\\
141 - Wait, Jackie,
should I be worried that\\
142 - he's spending so
much time with Shelly?\\
143 - Okay, well, normally
I'd say yeah,\\
144 - but Eric would
never cheat on you.\\
145 - I mean, all guys cheat, but I
never really thought of Eric as a guy.\\
146 - Yeah, he's more like
a really masculine girl.\\
147 - Uh-huh.\\
148 - Yeah, kind of like you.\\
149 - Mmm, lookee, lookee, lookee!\\
150 - Ribs, corn bread
and baked beans.\\
151 - Come to Papa!\\
152 - Ow!\\
153 - Papa been slapped.\\
154 - No, now,
that food's for the kids.\\
155 - But here, I boiled you
some skinless chicken.\\
156 - Ew! It's gray!\\
157 - Laurie!\\
158 - I mean, it's gray!\\
159 - Yay!\\
160 - Look, he's already home.\\
161 - I can't believe I
was so suspicious.\\
162 - He's such a good guy.\\
163 - I'm gonna write him a note.
A little "I love you."\\
164 - You know, Michael once
wrote me a sexy note.\\
165 - Except he can't really spell,\\
166 - so I didn't know what I was
supposed to do to him.\\
167 - Oh, my God!\\
168 - Donna, you should not leave
your panties in your boyfriend's car.\\
169 - I didn't.\\
170 - Oh.\\
171 - Oh!\\
172 - Oh.\\
173 - - Is this your card?
- No.\\
174 - - Is this your card?
- No.\\
175 - - Is this your card?
- No.\\
176 - Ah, screw you.\\
177 - Hey, Kelso.\\
178 - I had a dream
about you last night.\\
179 - - Really?
- Yeah.\\
180 - We were doing stuff and
it was all hot and sweaty\\
181 - and I just kept calling
your name over and over,\\
182 - "Tater Nuts! Tater Nuts!"\\
183 - Then what?\\
184 - Hey, Laurie, I found
something in Eric's car\\
185 - that I think must
probably be yours.\\
186 - Is that...\\
187 - Oh, good heavens, it is.\\
188 - I'm in the presence of panties.\\
189 - Donna, please.
I don't wear pink panties.\\
190 - Yeah. She'd have to wear
panties to wear pink panties.\\
191 - Hyde, did you have
a girl in Eric's car?\\
192 - No. Oh, but I did have
some nachos in there.\\
193 - And to mess with Forman,\\
194 - I smeared cheese underneath
the seat so it'd really stink.\\
195 - - Did it stink in there?
- Kind of.\\
196 - All right!\\
197 - Well, then, whose are they?\\
198 - Hello? You have
not asked me.\\
199 - Could they not be Fez's panties?\\
200 - I mean, is that so hard to
imagine, Fez in a car with a woman?\\
201 - Whose could they be?\\
202 - All right, Donna, here.
I'll figure this out.\\
203 - I like to think of myself
as the Columbo of panties.\\
204 - Yeah. I'd say we're
looking at a woman.\\
205 - Ages 16 to 38\\
206 - with a five-figure income.\\
207 - She lives within
a four-mile radius of here\\
208 - and is very popular
with the gentlemen.\\
209 - Sure she is. She'll have sex
in a car that stinks like cheese.\\
210 - So what you're saying is
they could be Shelly's.\\
211 - Come on. Forman
wouldn't cheat on Donna.\\
212 - Sure, he would.
Shelly's a tramp.\\
213 - No man can turn down a tramp.\\
214 - Well, let's find out. Laurie,
have you ever been turned down?\\
215 - Nope.\\
216 - Sorry, Donna.\\
217 - Don't feel sorry for me.\\
218 - Feel sorry for Eric,
'cause I'm gonna kill him!\\
219 - Will somebody please open
the door so I can kill Eric?\\
220 - Hey there, Red.\\
221 - Does Mrs. Forman
know you're out here\\
222 - clogging your arteries
with a double cheese?\\
223 - Yes.\\
224 - So there would be no
reason to tell her.\\
225 - Sorry, Red. I don't think
I could lie to Mrs. Forman.\\
226 - 'Cause I really,
really love her.\\
227 - All right, you blackmailing
S.O.B., what do you want?\\
228 - Sure could use some fries.\\
229 - Here. Now beat it.\\
230 - You don't have to be rude.\\
231 - What if this wasn't
even the first time?\\
232 - What if there have been
other girls? Other panties?\\
233 - Eric, where did
these panties come from?\\
234 - Gee, I don't know, but
there's nothing in the dresser.\\
235 - Nothing at all.\\
236 - Okay, but at least my
closet is pantie-free.\\
237 - Donna, you have my word.\\
238 - Okay, Donna, please, ignore
the rope in the middle of the room.\\
239 - And whatever you do,
don't pull it.\\
240 - Eric, how do you
explain all this?\\
241 - Panties!
Glorious panties!\\
242 - Bastard!\\
243 - Hey, there, Donna.
Where are you going?\\
244 - To The Hub, to kick Eric's ass!\\
245 - Yeah, well, kick it good.\\
246 - Jackie, why is Donna
gonna beat up Eric?\\
247 - Donna found another woman's
panties in the Vista Cruiser.\\
248 - Oh, no.\\
249 - I know, right?
Eric's cheating on her.\\
250 - Jackie, those panties were mine.\\
251 - You and Eric?\\
252 - No! Me and...\\
253 - Jeez, you're dumb.\\
254 - Now, remember,\\
255 - we can't have the protons and
electrons right next to each other\\
256 - because that
would just be madness.\\
257 - Madness, I say!\\
258 - Eric Forman, you are just the
funniest person I've ever met.\\
259 - No, I wouldn't go as...\\
260 - Yes. Yes, I am.\\
261 - Doesn't your girlfriend mind you
spending so much time with me?\\
262 - Well, no. Apparently,
she's thrilled about it.\\
263 - Well, she's crazy.\\
264 - 'Cause if I was your girlfriend,\\
265 - I would want to
kiss you all the time.\\
266 - Really?\\
267 - Whoa! Hey, come on,
lady. I'm spoken for.\\
268 - Wow!\\
269 - Hey, did we miss anything?\\
270 - What? God, no.
You didn't miss anything.\\
271 - All right, people! Let's back
up! Give them some room here!\\
272 - Hey, Donna, hi, hello.\\
273 - Don't "Hey,
Donna, hi, hello" me.\\
274 - I trusted you, and you
cheated on me with this slut!\\
275 - - Uh, Donna, I don't...
- Excuse me?\\
276 - Yeah, I said it. You want
some of this? Come on!\\
277 - Donna, hey, whatever
you think happened...\\
278 - I know what happened.
I found these in your car!\\
279 - Panties?\\
280 - Ah-ha. So he
admits they are panties.\\
281 - Hey, next time you fool around
with someone else's boyfriend,\\
282 - why don't you take your
panties when you're done?\\
283 - Those aren't mine. Mine
are white, and cotton.\\
284 - With a little pink
rose in the front.\\
285 - So these are some
other girl's panties?\\
286 - Whoa, whoa. No offense,
Donna, but, dude, you're on fire!\\
287 - You know what, Eric?
I don't need this.\\
288 - And by the way,
your car smells like cheese.\\
289 - Donna, look,
you have to believe me.\\
290 - I have no idea
whose panties those are.\\
291 - Donna, those panties are mine.\\
292 - Eric!\\
293 - Ohh!\\
294 - Ohh!\\
295 - You are a god!\\
296 - A god, I say!\\
297 - Um, Mom,\\
298 - why were your panties
in the Vista Cruiser?\\
299 - And please be as specific.\\
300 - Donna, when you've been together\\
301 - as long as your
father and I have,\\
302 - you need to do creative things
in creative places.\\
303 - - Ooh!
- Ohh!\\
304 - That's...\\
305 - Psst.\\
306 - Daddy, here.\\
307 - Red, you eating again? I thought
you'd be full after that burger.\\
308 - Burger?\\
309 - Yeah, the broccoli burger.\\
310 - Oh, you are lying!\\
311 - Come on, Kitty.\\
312 - This isn't food.
This is what food eats.\\
313 - Well, but it's good for you.\\
314 - Well, if it's so good,\\
315 - how come I'm the only
one that has to eat it?\\
316 - Good point.\\
317 - Hey, he's the food sneaker!\\
318 - Eat up.\\
319 - You wanna mess with me again?\\
320 - You just come on back.\\
321 - - Say it again.
- I already said it.\\
322 - Come on, one more time.\\
323 - You're hot.\\
324 - Hot enough to get Shelly?\\
325 - Hot enough to get Shelly.\\
326 - Hot enough to get
any girl I want?\\
327 - Hot enough to get Shelly.\\
328 - Yeah. That's just good stuff.\\
329 - You know, Eric,
you don't have to rub it in.\\
330 - I know I made
an ass out of myself.\\
331 - Well, you know what?\\
332 - That's what you get
for taking me for granted.\\
333 - 'Cause, Donna,
I may be skinny, but...\\
334 - Yeah, I'm Mick Jagger skinny.
That's very in right now.\\
335 - Yeah, it's very hot.\\
336 - Eric, I know you're hot,
'cause you're with me.\\
337 - Okay. So what have we learnt
from all this?\\
338 - Always lock the doors
in the Vista Cruiser.\\
339 - Right you are.\\
340 - Man, Bob and Midge
must really hate me.\\
341 - 'Cause right after
having sex in my car,\\
342 - I think they smeared cheese
under the seat.\\
343 - That's just mean.\\
344 - There. Okay, I think it's safe
for human occupancy again.\\
345 - Uh-oh.\\
346 - Looks like Bob left something
in the car, too.\\
347 - Eric, you must sell this car.\\
348 - Or call a priest.
\subsection {Episode 07: Baby Fever}
1 - Hey. Check it out. I got my
first story in the school paper.\\
2 - Neat.
They spelled your name wrong.\\
3 - Apparently,
you're "Donna Pincipotti."\\
4 - That's funny, 'cause it's got
the "potty" sound in it.\\
5 - Hey, you know what
else is a funny sound?\\
6 - Where the hell is Jackie
with your van, man?\\
7 - - I want to get out of here.
- She had to help
her aunt move a couch.\\
8 - Why did you lend Jackie
your van? She hates you, man.\\
9 - I'm trying to get on
her good side, Fez.\\
10 - I mean, this is a small town
with a limited number of women.\\
11 - I've already gone all the way through
them once and now I'm back to Jackie.\\
12 - Oh, yeah, and I love her.\\
13 - - Hey.
- Hey. So, how'd it go, baby?\\
14 - Oh, great. Here.\\
15 - - Cool.
- Yeah.\\
16 - Except for when
I crashed your van.\\
17 - But other than that, cool.\\
18 - How did this happen?
Jackie, how?\\
19 - - Michael, like I said...
- How?\\
20 - - Coming out of the drive...
- How?\\
21 - Kelso. Come on, man. Relax.\\
22 - Let those of us who aren't you
enjoy this moment.\\
23 - Besides, it's not all that
bad. This door still works.\\
24 - Hey, Jackie. What
happened to the other door?\\
25 - Other door?\\
26 - Yeah, you know, the thing that always
got in the way of this giant, gaping hole.\\
27 - Jackie, what are these?\\
28 - Uh...\\
29 - Van sticks.\\
30 - No. Jackie,
these are not van sticks.\\
31 - These are drumsticks.\\
32 - Whose drumsticks are they?\\
33 - Oh wow, Jackie, what's up?\\
34 - Okay. Fine. You know what? I used your
van to drive Chip and his band to a gig.\\
35 - Jackie...\\
36 - ...is Chip a girl?\\
37 - Uh...\\
38 - No.\\
39 - You had other guys in my van?\\
40 - You're dating a band?\\
41 - It wasn't a date.
It was a gig.\\
42 - Whatever it was,
it was a gross misuse of van.\\
43 - And you owe me money, big time!\\
44 - I owe you money?\\
45 - What about all the stuff I bought
you while we were together?\\
46 - That does not count. You gave
me those things so I would love you.\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - We're all, all right\\
54 - We're all, all right\\
55 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
56 - Look what I've got.\\
57 - Ew! What's that?\\
58 - That is Marissa.\\
59 - Carol's baby.\\
60 - And you promised me last night
that you'd baby-sit her.\\
61 - Last night? But I was drunk.\\
62 - - Why can't you do it?
- Because you promised.\\
63 - And besides...\\
64 - ...your father and I are having
fondue and Parcheesi at the Pinciottis'.\\
65 - Well...\\
66 - ...then I'll do it.\\
67 - No. Laurie can
watch this baby tonight.\\
68 - Golly, Laurie, a baby.\\
69 - And just in time
for your black mass.\\
70 - Hey. What did I tell you about
calling your sister the devil?\\
71 - That it's offensive
to the devil?\\
72 - No, Laurie.
You can't feed a baby bacon.\\
73 - Okay, okay.
What color is the baby?\\
74 - Well, good. Now,
if that changes, call me.\\
75 - - Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.\\
76 - We have just got the cutest little
baby over at our house right now.\\
77 - - Isn't she cute, Red?
- Yeah,
I just can't get over it.\\
78 - Jeez, Bob.\\
79 - You got your
fingers in the cheese.\\
80 - Remember how cute Laurie and
Eric were when they were babies?\\
81 - They used to
just laugh and play.\\
82 - Well, every time I was around,
all they did was scream.\\
83 - I just think it would be nice to
have a baby around the house again.\\
84 - Oh, damn it, Bob.\\
85 - Get your fingers
out of the cheese.\\
86 - Ugh!\\
87 - Do you think it would still
do this if I stopped feeding it?\\
88 - Laurie, let me do that.\\
89 - Wow.
How'd you do that last move?\\
90 - It's all in the wrist.\\
91 - See?\\
92 - Hey,
look at the wrist on my girl.\\
93 - Shut up.\\
94 - All right, let's go.\\
95 - Wait. Wait, no. Donna, wait.
I think it really likes you.\\
96 - Ooh! I think it just
said your name.\\
97 - Donna.\\
98 - Hey, you know,
you were really good in there.\\
99 - Well, it's not
exactly brain surgery.\\
100 - I know, but it was so cool.
It's just...\\
101 - I think it's really, really
cool that you can do that.\\
102 - Eric, you're, like, over the moon
'cause I changed a poopy diaper,\\
103 - but when I got my story
in the school paper\\
104 - all you said was, "Yeah, they
called you Donna Pincipotti."\\
105 - It's a funny sound. "Potty."\\
106 - Come on. Try not to laugh.\\
107 - That's good.\\
108 - Come on, Donna.
About the diaper thing,\\
109 - I was just paying
you a compliment.\\
110 - What was the compliment?\\
111 - That you are gonna be so great
staying home with our kids.\\
112 - What?\\
113 - Eric, how exactly do
you see our future?\\
114 - Okay. Okay. That could work.\\
115 - I would just like to
adjust one little thing.\\
116 - Okay, the businesswoman
idea is good.\\
117 - But what about this?\\
118 - Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah. I would
just change one thing.\\
119 - That seems more
hurtful than sexy.\\
120 - Jackass.\\
121 - So does that.\\
122 - You owe me money.\\
123 - Michael, your uncle
gave you that van for free.\\
124 - Yeah? Well, I put a lot
of money into that van.\\
125 - The shag carpeting...\\
126 - ...uh, eight-track...\\
127 - ...strobe light,
black light, red light.\\
128 - - I hate you.
- Well, I hate you more.\\
129 - - I hate you most.
- Well, I hate you...\\
130 - Damn it!\\
131 - All right. All right.\\
132 - Let's just act like adults and
treat this like what it really is...\\
133 - A divorce.\\
134 - Jackie, you get custody of me.\\
135 - All right. Let's just figure out
what you guys owe each other.\\
136 - Fine. I'm not afraid. I'm
right, and he's a total moocher.\\
137 - I'm not afraid, either. There are
laws to protect a man and his van.\\
138 - For instance,
the Man-Van Act of 1847.\\
139 - Right.\\
140 - All right, all right.\\
141 - Jackie, in your opinion...\\
142 - ...what are the goods and
services that Kelso owes you for?\\
143 - Everything. He was a total
doofus before I met him.\\
144 - In fact, I bought you
that belt, so hand it over.\\
145 - - And the shirt, too.
- Fine.\\
146 - You know, this shirt has bad
memories of you buying me stuff, anyway.\\
147 - Here. Let me do the math.\\
148 - Okay. Now, Kelso...\\
149 - Kelso owes Jackie the price
for breaking her beautiful heart\\
150 - and stealing her innocence.\\
151 - Now, Kelso, what do you
believe Jackie owes you?\\
152 - Well...\\
153 - Uh...\\
154 - One time, I told her that
she looked pretty\\
155 - when really,
she looked pretty skanky.\\
156 - And...\\
157 - And...\\
158 - - Hyde, help me out here.
- Okay. Let me think.\\
159 - Oh! Don't forget
he burnt your house.\\
160 - - Hyde!
- Dude, you burnt her house.\\
161 - Oh, and that clean baby smell.\\
162 - Yes, but when we had babies\\
163 - we couldn't go to the movies
or out to dinner.\\
164 - Oh Red, when was the last time we
went to the movies or out to dinner?\\
165 - Well, exactly. Who needs to leave the
house when there are no babies in it?\\
166 - I gotta thank my lucky stars
I got the old snippety-snip.\\
167 - Bob, you mean you just
let some quack remove...\\
168 - On, no. Nothing's removed.\\
169 - Okay. That's enough of that.\\
170 - Yeah, well, I guess it's okay if it means
you don't have to have any more babies.\\
171 - Oh Red, it was fun having
babies. Remember fun?\\
172 - Yes, Kitty, but it was also
a large responsibility.\\
173 - Or burden, if you will.\\
174 - Red Forman, I don't wanna hear another word
out of you, unless it's "I love babies."\\
175 - - Kitty, you're making a scene.
- That is not "I love babies."\\
176 - - Kitty,
what's the matter with you?
- Oh, well, I don't...\\
177 - I don't wanna ruin
our nice night out\\
178 - because, boy, Midge, you can
really melt a super pot of cheese\\
179 - but, um, I think I
want another baby.\\
180 - Really? You liked my cheese?\\
181 - This is Aqua Net,
the same stuff Farrah uses.\\
182 - And she's got a big TV show,
and she's married to Lee Majors,\\
183 - so, Aqua Net, very important.\\
184 - Come on, Red.\\
185 - Look how sweet this baby is.
Just hold it.\\
186 - Look, Kitty.\\
187 - I didn't touch our kids when they were
babies, and I'm not touching this one.\\
188 - - Red Forman,
you touch this baby.
- Nope.\\
189 - - Touch it.
- Not happening.\\
190 - Is this child wearing lip liner?\\
191 - So, turns out
my super-sensitive-guy\\
192 - boyfriend wants me
to be a baby machine.\\
193 - Pfft. What a dillhole.\\
194 - Donna, I'm sitting right here.\\
195 - That's why I said it,
you dillhole.\\
196 - Donna, the only reason I thought
you'd stay home with the babies\\
197 - is because only every woman has
done it for the entire history of time.\\
198 - So don't be mad at me.
Be mad at your foremothers.\\
199 - Yeah.\\
200 - That is so typical.\\
201 - As if every woman wants to spend
her life as a pampered housewife,\\
202 - raising kids and
organizing the help.\\
203 - Wait. Isn't that
what every woman wants?\\
204 - Donna, man...\\
205 - Forman's just
limited by his experiences.\\
206 - As the voice of a new generation
of smart, independent women,\\
207 - you need to make this dillhole
realize that a mind and spirit like yours\\
208 - has more options
than your mothers had.\\
209 - Yeah.\\
210 - Sorry, what?\\
211 - All right, Donna. So...\\
212 - ...are we cool?\\
213 - I'm not wrong.
Women take care of babies.\\
214 - - They do.
- Listen to him, Marissa.\\
215 - He whines like a girl,
but he's not a girl.\\
216 - Or maybe he is.\\
217 - The thing is,
Donna's really good at it.\\
218 - I mean, I could understand you not
wanting to stay home with your children.\\
219 - You already have such a
fulfilling career as a whore.\\
220 - Listen, twerp.\\
221 - Did you ever think maybe it's not
that she doesn't wanna have babies?\\
222 - Maybe she just doesn't want
to have your skinny, whiny,\\
223 - girl-trapped-in-a-boy-body
babies.\\
224 - Okay, that's one for you.\\
225 - I'm cold.\\
226 - That must be why your
nipples are so pointy.\\
227 - Oh, Pointy Nipple Man is mad.\\
228 - I hope he doesn't poke me
with his pointy nipples.\\
229 - All right.
That was really disturbing.\\
230 - Okay. Here we go.\\
231 - According to my calculations,
for repairs to the van,\\
232 - Jackie, you owe Kelso $65.\\
233 - A-ha!\\
234 - Justice!\\
235 - Yeah.\\
236 - And, Kelso,
you owe Jackie $8,265.\\
237 - A-ha!\\
238 - Pay up, moocher!\\
239 - What? No! No! This is...\\
240 - That's totally unfair!\\
241 - Hyde, you suck.\\
242 - You could have been a man
and forgiven her, but, no,\\
243 - you wanted to do the math.\\
244 - Man, math has
never been my friend.\\
245 - Wait, no. But she had
other guys in my van.\\
246 - Michael, you had other girls in
your van while we were dating.\\
247 - So give me my $8,000.\\
248 - Okay. I change my mind.\\
249 - I forgive you.\\
250 - See, if we had a baby right now,\\
251 - we could be giving it a bath,\\
252 - we could be putting it
in its warm little jammies.\\
253 - Yeah. It's a shame that
we have to crawl into bed\\
254 - for eight hours of
uninterrupted sleep instead.\\
255 - Come on.\\
256 - You don't really
want another baby.\\
257 - Well, I don't know.\\
258 - I only have a few years left
where I even have the option.\\
259 - Well, just because you can have
a baby doesn't mean you should.\\
260 - I have a snow blower,
but I don't use it in July.\\
261 - Red, it just...\\
262 - It feels like maybe we've done
everything important there is to do.\\
263 - We saved up. We got our house.
We had our kids.\\
264 - Now what's left
to look forward to?\\
265 - Peace and quiet.\\
266 - Well...\\
267 - I just can't believe we're never gonna
hear that sound in our house again.\\
268 - Well,
until we have grandchildren.\\
269 - Grandchildren!\\
270 - I forgot about grandchildren!\\
271 - So did I.\\
272 - Oh, boy.\\
273 - I like the looks of that.
My baby with a baby.\\
274 - It's not that hard.\\
275 - I heard her crying, and I
figured she needed a bottle,\\
276 - and it turned out that she did.\\
277 - So...\\
278 - You think you might want
a baby of your own?\\
279 - Well, yeah. I mean, once
my looks start to go, why not?\\
280 - All right.\\
281 - So how many kids are we
talking here? One? Two? Six?\\
282 - Whoa, Mum. Ease up, okay? I'm
not even down to one boyfriend yet.\\
283 - But you will be soon, right?\\
284 - Well, Zeke gets out of jail
in three months.\\
285 - Okay.\\
286 - I'm gonna go talk to Eric.\\
287 - Mum,\\
288 - are you happy?\\
289 - Sure. What's this about?\\
290 - I don't know. It's like...\\
291 - Eric said this stupid thing about
me not working when we're married,\\
292 - and I just want to do something
more meaningful with my life\\
293 - than have kids, you know?\\
294 - - No offense.
- No. No, that's okay.\\
295 - It's not like I never wondered
what my life could have been like\\
296 - if I hadn't married
your father. I mean, I...\\
297 - Well,
I could have been a doctor.\\
298 - - Exactly.
- Or a dancing girl.\\
299 - Right.\\
300 - Honey, don't worry so much
about what Eric said.\\
301 - You're probably not even gonna
have to deal with this, anyway.\\
302 - - How do you figure that?
- Well, you and Eric
are so young.\\
303 - The chances are you're not
gonna end up together, anyway.\\
304 - All right, Donna, that's it.
We gotta figure this out.\\
305 - Because this is just hanging
over our heads,\\
306 - like one of those huge,
awful hanging things.\\
307 - Let's not worry
about this anymore.\\
308 - Let's go for a drive, okay?\\
309 - Okay.\\
310 - I'm sorry.
Do you want to say something else?\\
311 - No. Just...\\
312 - I love you.\\
313 - Oh.\\
314 - - Enough to strip for me?
- All right.\\
315 - No. I mean, I love you, too.
I'd strip for you.\\
316 - Laurie, her mother is waiting.\\
317 - I don't care. I love her,
and I'm not giving her back!\\
318 - What are you doing with that?\\
319 - Give me back the baby, missy,
or, so help me, the dryer goes down.\\
320 - - You wouldn't.
- I would.\\
321 - Fine. Fine, take her.\\
322 - Shh, baby, you're okay now.

3 - Uh, they're everywhere,

15 - So, Steven...\\
16 - Would you like to go to
Mr. Forman's barbecue with me?\\
17 - No.\\
18 - As a matter of fact,\\
19 - I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.\\
20 - No, that's okay.
You know what?\\
21 - We can stay in.\\
22 - No, Jackie. Look, I told
you again and again,\\
23 - I have no interest in you
and you don't have a chance.\\
24 - And yet you keep thinking
that I have interest in you\\
25 - and you have a chance.\\
26 - Wait. Did you just say
that you are interested in me\\
27 - and that I have a chance?\\
28 - Okay, you know what,
you forced me to do this.\\
29 - I'm gonna explain
my feelings to you\\
30 - through a highly disciplined
form of Japanese poetry,\\
31 - haiku.\\
32 - My heart aches with pain.\\
33 - When I see you, I vomit.\\
34 - Die away from me.\\
35 - Ouch.\\
36 - Sayonara.\\
37 - Donna, never have
17 syllables hurt me so much.\\
38 - Why would he want
to hurt me like that?\\
39 - Because you're
stalking him, Jackie.\\
40 - No. Really, Donna?\\
41 - Jackie, really.\\
42 - You are to Hyde
what Fez is to you.\\
43 - That's ridiculous.
Fez and I will never happen.\\
44 - Oh, God.\\
45 - Steven and I will never happen.\\
46 - Jackie, it's all right.\\
47 - You just gotta get
over this. Be strong.\\
48 - You're right, Donna.
You're right.\\
49 - I wish my daddy
could buy him for me.\\
50 - Yeah, I know.
I know.\\
51 - Does this smell like
chocolate to you?\\
52 - Hanging out\\
53 - Down the street\\
54 - The same old thing\\
55 - We did last week\\
56 - Not a thing to do\\
57 - But talk to you\\
58 - We're all, all right\\
59 - We're all, all right\\
60 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
61 - Hey, look. I'm Paul
Stanley from KISS.\\
62 - Kelso, don't play
with the cheese.\\
63 - These damn kids, they don't
respect anything American.\\
64 - Oh, Red, this
isn't about the kids\\
65 - misusing dairy products.\\
66 - You're still upset
that Bob marched\\
67 - in the Veterans Day parade.\\
68 - Well, he was only
in the National Guard.\\
69 - It's called Veterans Day,\\
70 - not Pansy Ass National
Guard Wussy Pansy-Ass day.\\
71 - Oh, come on, Red,\\
72 - are any dirty commies
less dead because of him?\\
73 - No, I guess not.\\
74 - You're right, Kitty.\\
75 - You know, I'm gonna
put away this uniform,\\
76 - and then
we'll fire up that grill.\\
77 - Hey, Red.
Some parade, huh?\\
78 - Yeah, sure was, till the
National Guard got there.\\
79 - Look, I just came over to
invite you to my barbecue.\\
80 - Your barbecue?\\
81 - Bob, I have an annual barbecue\\
82 - every Veterans Day. It's my
day because I'm a veteran.\\
83 - Well, I'm a veteran, too.\\
84 - And I'm having a barbecue,
and you can't stop me.\\
85 - Hey, Mr. Pinciotti, I didn't know
you were in the Boy Scouts.\\
86 - Hey, everybody.
This is Chip.\\
87 - He's been after
me for a while now,\\
88 - so I just said,
"What the hell?"\\
89 - Chip, it's everybody.\\
90 - Hey, everybody.\\
91 - Jackie, I'll get you
something to drink.\\
92 - Whatever.\\
93 - So you're with
this Chip guy now?\\
94 - Yep.\\
95 - Huh.\\
96 - Why? Do you care?\\
97 - No, I mean, if you want
to date this guy, that's cool.\\
98 - It is?\\
99 - And then Steven said,
"That's cool."\\
100 - But not like, "Cool."
More like he's jealous.\\
101 - Jackie, or he just
thinks it's cool.\\
102 - Donna, it is so romantic.\\
103 - Just like West Side Story.\\
104 - Yeah, but without the
dancing and the Puerto Ricans.\\
105 - Wait. Is Fez Puerto Rican?\\
106 - You know what? I don't know.\\
107 - Huh.\\
108 - This will show Red. We're gonna
have the best barbecue ever.\\
109 - If there's one thing you
learn in the National Guard,\\
110 - it's how to cook.\\
111 - Oh, I'm gonna
defrost some chicken.\\
112 - Mum, the Formans have a
barbecue every Veterans Day.\\
113 - I mean, why are we having one?\\
114 - Honey, this isn't
about a barbecue,\\
115 - this is about your
father going bankrupt.\\
116 - Now help me with these chairs.\\
117 - What? What are you
talking about?\\
118 - We need the chairs
for people to sit on.\\
119 - No, Mom.
About Dad being bankrupt.\\
120 - Your dad's appliance store's
going out of business,\\
121 - 'cause he can't
compete with Price Mart,\\
122 - so he decided to
throw a big barbecue.\\
123 - Okay,
I'm still not getting this.\\
124 - Oh. Your dad wants to be
big shot one last time\\
125 - before everybody discovers
what a failure he is.\\
126 - Oh, my God.\\
127 - And please don't tell anybody.\\
128 - He's very sensitive
about being a failure.\\
129 - Here you go.
Enjoy your burger.\\
130 - And thank you for
choosing the Formans\\
131 - for your Veterans
Day celebration needs.\\
132 - Kitty, why is
everybody over at Bob's?\\
133 - They've got chicken.\\
134 - Chicken?\\
135 - Well, isn't that a surprise?\\
136 - A National Guardsman
serving up chicken.\\
137 - Well, he's not gonna
get away with this.\\
138 - Eric, chop up some onions
and mix it in with the meat.\\
139 - Why can't we just put the
onions on top of the burger?\\
140 - Eric, do you want to win
this thing, or don't you?\\
141 - Okay, not-crazy Dad.\\
142 - Eric, can I talk to you?\\
143 - Uh, not really, Donna.
I got to bust hump.\\
144 - My dad wants to crush
your dad's barbecue.\\
145 - What? Why?\\
146 - Well, apparently,
my dad believes that\\
147 - if your dad's barbecue
is better than his,\\
148 - America will fall
to the Russkies.\\
149 - Did you ever stop to think that\\
150 - maybe my dad's barbecue
is really important to him?\\
151 - Uh...\\
152 - No, because it's
just a stupid barbecue.\\
153 - It's not stupid.\\
154 - I'm so sick of your dad.
He's such a jerk.\\
155 - Whoa. My dad's a jerk?\\
156 - Well, Donna, your dad's a jerk,\\
157 - and he's just copying my dad.\\
158 - And your dad didn't
even fight in the war.\\
159 - You're just
a National Guard kid.\\
160 - Yeah, I said it.
What? What?\\
161 - Oh, yeah? Well, you
and Red are going down.\\
162 - And you know what else?
I was wrong, Eric.\\
163 - Red's not a jerk. He's
an ass, and you're an ass,\\
164 - 'cause the ass doesn't
fall far from the ass tree.\\
165 - "What'd I say?
What, what?"\\
166 - Man, I can't believe Jackie
chose that guy over me.\\
167 - Or me for that matter.\\
168 - Yeah, that's true 'cause
you're a good-looking guy.\\
169 - Back at you, Kelso.\\
170 - Your eyelashes,
they go for, like, miles.\\
171 - I've heard that.\\
172 - Yeah. I'm what's
known as, "Man-pretty."\\
173 - Bad news, Dad. The
Pinciottis have these.\\
174 - Red, white and blue napkins?\\
175 - That clever SOB.\\
176 - And I cheaped out and
went for the plain white.\\
177 - So, what,
now we surrender?\\
178 - Surrender?\\
179 - You know, if this
were an actual war,\\
180 - you'd be the first
in a body bag.\\
181 - Yes, sir. I'm gonna
go refill the ketchups.\\
182 - Schlitz.\\
183 - Hey, Jackie. Who's that hot
guy you brought with you?\\
184 - Back off!
I need him for right now,\\
185 - but you can have him
when I'm done, as usual.\\
186 - Wait a second, Jackie.\\
187 - Are you working
an angle here? Nice.\\
188 - No, there's no angle.\\
189 - I just want to see if I
can make Steven jealous.\\
190 - So you're gonna sleep
with him a couple of times\\
191 - and see what happens.\\
192 - Yeah, I've been down that road.\\
193 - No!\\
194 - Oh, you're such a child. Send
him to my room when you're done.\\
195 - So, you and Jackie, huh?\\
196 - Yeah, isn't she something?\\
197 - Sure.\\
198 - Sometimes, though, I kind
of hate it when she talks.\\
199 - I hear you.\\
200 - And she's always talking.\\
201 - But I figure it's worth
it if I can nail her.\\
202 - Huh.\\
203 - Yeah, you should probably
think about that, man.\\
204 - You know, I mean,
Jackie's kind of young.\\
205 - She only had, like,
one boyfriend, so...\\
206 - Hey, that's not a big surprise.\\
207 - You know, she's a bitch.\\
208 - Oh, no.\\
209 - Steven, what happened?\\
210 - What? Nothing.\\
211 - Just somebody... And
then the guy said, "Bitch,"\\
212 - and there's nothing.\\
213 - Oh, my God. He called
me a bitch and you hit him.\\
214 - And that's what happened,
isn't it?\\
215 - No.\\
216 - Liar. I am the bitch,
and you love me.\\
217 - Stop staring at me.\\
218 - Quit it. I'm not this guy.\\
219 - Oh, God.\\
220 - Oh, Steven, I saw what
happened. Is your girlfriend okay?\\
221 - My girlfriend?\\
222 - Yeah, the bossy,
little, mean one\\
223 - you're always
hanging around with.\\
224 - Oh, uh, Jackie.\\
225 - She's not my girlfriend.\\
226 - Are you sure?\\
227 - Yes, I'm sure.\\
228 - I don't like her. She's shallow
and rich and mean and bossy.\\
229 - She's everything that I hate.\\
230 - But, Steven,
you hate everything.\\
231 - What's that supposed to mean?\\
232 - Well, it means that
maybe you like her,\\
233 - 'cause I kind of think you do.\\
234 - No. How could I like her?\\
235 - Because I don't like her.
Because I can't like her.\\
236 - Mrs. Forman, if I
like her, shoot me.\\
237 - Pow.\\
238 - Jackie, get your car. We're
going on a freaking date.\\
239 - Oh, my God. It's a
Veterans Day miracle.\\
240 - Red, white, and blue
cheeseburgers. Eric, you're a genius.\\
241 - Voila.\\
242 - Sparkler dogs.
God bless America.\\
243 - Freshly squeezed.\\
244 - That's fresh.\\
245 - Ah. Beer in the bottle.
That's class.\\
246 - The keg is tapped.\\
247 - Bend over and kiss
it good-bye, Bob.\\
248 - Here comes the big one.\\
249 - A keg? Oh, great.\\
250 - Red's gone nuclear.\\
251 - This barbecue is over.\\
252 - Dad, that's it?\\
253 - You're just gonna give up?\\
254 - We had sparkler dogs.
We could win this thing.\\
255 - No. Donna, thanks,
but it's over.\\
256 - I just wanted one big blowout.\\
257 - One last hurrah, you know?\\
258 - Oh, why didn't I rent
the one-man band?\\
259 - This is the best date ever.\\
260 - Jackie, we haven't
talked in 30 minutes.\\
261 - That's okay. Steven, you
don't have to say anything.\\
262 - I understand you.\\
263 - Oh, you do, do you?\\
264 - Sure.\\
265 - Okay, so you're probably
sitting there thinking,\\
266 - "I'm on this date with this girl\\
267 - "who really, really likes me.\\
268 - "And she's so
beautiful that..."\\
269 - Jackie.
Hush.\\
270 - And you're wondering,\\
271 - "How can I open up to her\\
272 - "when everyone I have ever
loved have abandoned me?\\
273 - "Am I even
worthy of love?"\\
274 - Well, you are, Steven.\\
275 - You are.\\
276 - It's okay, Steven.
It's okay.\\
277 - You know what?
Let it out.\\
278 - Let it all out.\\
279 - Okay.
It's okay.\\
280 - Let's go home.\\
281 - Oh, come on.
I'm kidding.\\
282 - No, this is, this is all right.\\
283 - We can hang out here
for a while, okay?\\
284 - God.\\
285 - Here, have some of my pop.\\
286 - Sure.\\
287 - Okay.\\
288 - Well, we've gone through
three batches of ambrosia salad.\\
289 - Three batches!\\
290 - Not since D-day has there been
such a complete and glorious victory.\\
291 - Oh. Hi, Donna.\\
292 - Well, I hope you're all happy,\\
293 - 'cause you ruined
my dad's barbecue.\\
294 - All he wanted was
one more good day\\
295 - before everybody found out\\
296 - that his store was closing,
and he's going bankrupt.\\
297 - Wait. What?
Yeah.\\
298 - Bargain Bob's is closing
this week, so congratulations.\\
299 - Oh, my God.
I feel so bad.\\
300 - Well, you should.
You ruined his barbecue.\\
301 - Why would you do that?\\
302 - What? Me? You were...\\
303 - Eric, for God's sakes, the
man is almost a veteran.\\
304 - Okay, fine. You know
what? Fine. It's all my fault.\\
305 - But, Dad, you... You got
to make everyone here\\
306 - go next door.\\
307 - Eric, you're right. We
have got to go over there.\\
308 - They are our neighbors.
They are our best friends.\\
309 - Yeah, I suppose.\\
310 - All right, freeloaders. Let's
move it on over to Bob's.\\
311 - Eric, grab that keg.\\
312 - Okay, I'm on it.\\
313 - Hey, what's everybody
doing here?\\
314 - Congratulations, Bob, you
really out-barbecued me.\\
315 - I got to say.
You're one hell of a guy.\\
316 - Oh, Bob.\\
317 - We just love you so much.\\
318 - Midge, you told.\\
319 - Look, Bob. I just
want you to know that\\
320 - you've been a real good
neighbor and a real good friend.\\
321 - And if you ever need it,
I'm here for you.\\
322 - Thanks, Red.\\
323 - Oh, but, I can't help
you if you cry, Bob.\\
324 - Don't cry.\\
325 - These are tears of joy, Red.\\
326 - Yeah, that's bad, too, Bob.\\
327 - Move!\\
328 - Come on.\\
329 - Hey.\\
330 - Oh, hey.
What's up? Hi.\\
331 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
332 - Everyone came by, and
I know you did that, so...\\
333 - Thanks.\\
334 - No, Donna. I'm sorry.\\
335 - Look, you know that I wouldn't
have acted like such a jerk\\
336 - if I knew something so terrible
was happening to your dad.\\
337 - No, I know, I know.
It's okay.\\
338 - My folks didn't want me
to say anything so...\\
339 - Yeah. No, I mean...\\
340 - Yeah.
Yeah.\\
341 - Are you okay?\\
342 - Yeah, and no.\\
343 - I don't know.\\
344 - So,\\
345 - our first date's almost over.\\
346 - Yeah.\\
347 - What'd you think?\\
348 - It was no worse than bowling.\\
349 - I don't hate bowling.\\
350 - Huh.\\
351 - Okay. I didn't
feel anything.\\
352 - Nothing?\\
353 - No, I mean, the
kiss was hot, but...\\
354 - Well, did you feel something?\\
355 - Uh...\\
356 - No.\\
357 - Well...\\
358 - No.\\
359 - So I guess that's it, then.\\
360 - Turns out you were
right about us all along.\\
361 - Yeah.\\
362 - So what happens now?\\
363 - I'm not opposed to doing it.\\
364 - Take me home, you pig.\\
365 - Yes, dear.\\
366 - Fez?
Hmm.\\
367 - I don't feel so good.\\
368 - Me neither.\\
369 - You see a horse?\\
370 - Yes, I do.\\
371 - Is it pink?\\
372 - Uh-huh.\\
373 - This was the best barbecue ever.
\subsection {Episode 09: Hyde's Christmas Rager}
1 - All right, Hyde.\\
2 - Your dad's apartment is
the perfect place for a party.\\
3 - It's already trashed.\\
4 - Even if half the people we invited
show up, this party's gonna rock.\\
5 - - Did you find the cups?
- Nope.\\
6 - Even better,
a plastic tube and a funnel.\\
7 - All this and a dirty funnel?
Merry Christmas to me.\\
8 - Yeah, we don't even have to
worry about germs,\\
9 - because even though our spit
backs up in the tube,\\
10 - the alcohol kills them.\\
11 - - We're leaving.
- So leaving.\\
12 - Wait, you're leaving?\\
13 - Yeah, see, when I was a little
girl, I made a promise to myself.\\
14 - "Self," I said,\\
15 - "if you're ever about to suck beer out of
a funnel that might give you mono, don't."\\
16 - So, bye-bye.\\
17 - All right, Kelso, I'm gonna nix the funnel
on account of I think it repels women.\\
18 - Hey, any woman who doesn't appreciate
a nice funnel isn't much of a woman.\\
19 - - Hey, guys.
- Hey.\\
20 - What's with the keg?\\
21 - Throwing a little party. You
know, 'tis the season to get sloppy.\\
22 - - Well...
- You're cool with this, right?\\
23 - Sure, yeah. Cool dad,
that's me. Totally cool dad.\\
24 - Hey, listen. Have a merry, uh,\\
25 - keg party.\\
26 - Mr. Hyde, you're the best.\\
27 - Yeah, you're the best.\\
28 - Will you be my daddy?\\
29 - I'm not kidding.\\
30 - Seriously.\\
31 - - Hey, Fez, can you
grab this for me?
- Sure.\\
32 - You know, Kelso,
four times is not funny.\\
33 - Um, yes, it is.\\
34 - - Guess who?
- Eric, it's your mum!\\
35 - I'm not...\\
36 - Deck the halls
with boughs of holly\\
37 - Fa la la la la\\
38 - Oh, you're caroling.
That is so odd.\\
39 - Well, happy holidays.\\
40 - Look what I brought.
Mistletoe!\\
41 - Uh-oh.\\
42 - Uh-oh.\\
43 - Uh-oh.\\
44 - Fa la la la la\\
45 - Now, Steven, I brought some beautiful
Christmas ornaments to hang on your\\
46 - antenna.\\
47 - Mrs. Forman, you're not
checking up on me, are you?\\
48 - No, no. I'm just spreading
a little holiday cheer.\\
49 - Dusty.\\
50 - Oh, and this blanket, it needs
a nice Christmas washing.\\
51 - No, no, no, no, no!
That's Bud's Christmas stool.\\
52 - Very sentimental. If anybody
touches it, he just goes nuts, so...\\
53 - Huh.\\
54 - - Well, I don't quite
believe you, but okay.
- Okay.\\
55 - So Bud left
you boys here unsupervised?\\
56 - Oh.\\
57 - Salami in the couch.\\
58 - Now, that's sanitary.\\
59 - Okay, okay, then...\\
60 - Why don't you boys
hang up those angels?\\
61 - And, Eric, come in here\\
62 - and help me with the
traditional holiday floor wax.\\
63 - Mum, seriously, we're okay.\\
64 - Okay? You can go, really.\\
65 - Oh, good. Fez is making ice.\\
66 - Hanging out\\
67 - Down the street\\
68 - The same old thing\\
69 - We did last week\\
70 - Not a thing to do\\
71 - But talk to you\\
72 - We're all, all right\\
73 - We're all, all right\\
74 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
75 - Listen to this.\\
76 - "Corner him under the mistletoe. Eight
ways to trick a guy into a relationship."\\
77 - I love the holidays.\\
78 - Yeah, hanging your stocking,
putting cookies out for Santa,\\
79 - setting a mantrap.\\
80 - Mmm, Christmas.\\
81 - You know, Donna, this'll be the first year
I celebrate Christmas without a boyfriend.\\
82 - And Jesus wept.\\
83 - So here's my new plan
for the year.\\
84 - Buy some really cute tops, fly to
Hollywood, and marry Lee Majors.\\
85 - Make fun of that, I dare you.\\
86 - Jackie, there are so many ways
to make fun of that\\
87 - I don't even know
where to start.\\
88 - It's like choosing
your favorite jellybean.\\
89 - Donna, be nice to me.
I'm lonely.\\
90 - I mean, okay, if there were mistletoe
over me right now who would kiss me?\\
91 - No one, that's who.\\
92 - Being alone isn't that bad.\\
93 - It's a great opportunity
to get to know yourself\\
94 - and be comfortable
with who you are.\\
95 - Donna, I already love myself.
I just wanna French someone.\\
96 - I miss my funnel.\\
97 - - Eric, drink.
- Okay.\\
98 - If I was Tattoo,
and I lived on Fantasy Island,\\
99 - my fantasy would be to
not be a midget. Am I right?\\
100 - Eenie, meenie, miney, Forman.\\
101 - You know, Hyde, at first I thought
your dad was a real dirt bag.\\
102 - But I've come to realize that
there's a fine line between dirt bag\\
103 - and Father of the Year!\\
104 - Damn.\\
105 - Fellows, I have to be honest.\\
106 - I've never played quarters
before, so I probably stink.\\
107 - Oh. Happy day. Eric.\\
108 - Man, this is the worst game
in the world.\\
109 - I'm so thirsty.\\
110 - Damn it! Eric, drink!\\
111 - I mean, he lives on Fantasy
Island, man, and he's a midget!\\
112 - It's so obvious.\\
113 - Hmm.\\
114 - Forman.\\
115 - Does anyone else feel
kind of woozy?\\
116 - Oh, what the hell, man?\\
117 - If I make this shot, I promise
I will not pick you, Eric.\\
118 - I pick you, Eric.\\
119 - It's fun to lie.\\
120 - Donna, that's Fireman Rob and
Fireman Dean. They're firemen!\\
121 - Jackie, they're like 40.\\
122 - Whatever. They're firemen!\\
123 - Two hot firemen in a bar.
This is just like that play I wrote.\\
124 - Okay, give me five minutes.\\
125 - I'll pick the one I want,
and you can have the other.\\
126 - Hello! I'm dating
someone, Eric.\\
127 - Donna, Dean can
bench-press a keg.\\
128 - Eric can't even
bench-press a cup.\\
129 - He can, too.\\
130 - Rob, Dean, this is Donna.\\
131 - So what do you girls do?\\
132 - That's funny you should ask.
We go to high school!\\
133 - - Any outside interests?
- Uh-huh. High school guys!\\
134 - Kelso, it's fine.
I'm not that drunk.\\
135 - I just...\\
136 - I just can't walk or see.\\
137 - Man, that was...
That was a great party!\\
138 - You know
who doesn't like parties?\\
139 - Red.\\
140 - "I'm Red!\\
141 - "I don't like parties\\
142 - "because I'm a big,
bald party pooper!"\\
143 - Uh-oh.\\
144 - Uh-oh.\\
145 - Son of a bitch!\\
146 - Eric, when did
you eat spaghetti?\\
147 - I knew something was
going on at Bud's.\\
148 - When I went over there, the
only thing in the fridge, olives.\\
149 - And poor Fez
had ice in his pants.\\
150 - My head hurts.\\
151 - That's your brain trying to
comprehend its own stupidity.\\
152 - I mean, what kind of parent leaves a
bunch of teenagers alone with a keg?\\
153 - A fun one?\\
154 - Hey, Jim Beam, can it.\\
155 - - Red, you need to
have a talk with Bud.
- No.\\
156 - Eric's home now.\\
157 - And what goes on between Bud and
Steven is between Bud and Steven.\\
158 - He's just not a good dad.\\
159 - Well, you know what?\\
160 - I agree. So, I think
we should get in the car,\\
161 - pick up Steven, and move him
back in with us and feed him\\
162 - and clothe him and love him.\\
163 - No.\\
164 - I'm not loving anybody that
I'm not legally required to.\\
165 - Fine, I'll call Bud.\\
166 - - And, Eric,
I'll deal with you later.
- Thank you.\\
167 - Mummy, I don't feel so good.\\
168 - Well, if you're gonna get sick again,
why don't you throw up under the tree\\
169 - because Christmas is ruined!\\
170 - Oh, no.\\
171 - So tell me more
about the big ladder thingy.\\
172 - The cherry picker?\\
173 - Funny story. True story.\\
174 - Okay, Jackie, this is a
nightmare, and we're leaving.\\
175 - Okay.\\
176 - Look, Donna,
you have a boyfriend, I don't.\\
177 - And maybe I don't want to
sit home alone every night.\\
178 - And if somebody doesn't tell me
I'm cute in the next five minutes,\\
179 - I'm gonna scream!\\
180 - Hi. Sorry, my friend
was being a wet blanket.\\
181 - Well, maybe I should
talk to her.\\
182 - I mean, a wet blanket's
a fireman's best friend.\\
183 - Boy, something about you
is so familiar.\\
184 - You know,
I get that all the time.\\
185 - See, from the right,
I look like Gidget\\
186 - and from the left, I look like
Elizabeth Taylor. Neat, huh?\\
187 - Oh, it's your laugh!\\
188 - You know, I used to date
a girl with the same laugh,\\
189 - but that was 20 years ago.\\
190 - She dumped me
and married some rich lawyer.\\
191 - Burk... Burkhart.
That was it.\\
192 - Oh, my God, that's my name,
and my dad's a rich lawyer!\\
193 - Oh, my God!\\
194 - So, Jackie, was this
in the play you wrote?\\
195 - Kitty, why are you smoking?\\
196 - It's my Yuletide cigarette.\\
197 - To celebrate all the children\\
198 - who spend black Christmases
with bad parents.\\
199 - Kitty, put that out.\\
200 - Back off, Grinch.\\
201 - Hey, Red. Hey, Kitty.\\
202 - Bad parent.\\
203 - - Is she all right?
- Hmm?\\
204 - Oh, yeah. Sit down, Bud.\\
205 - Kitty, sweetheart,\\
206 - why don't you leave us alone
for a minute?\\
207 - A boy can't live on olives.\\
208 - Bud...\\
209 - Eric just came back from
your place falling-down drunk.\\
210 - He threw up on my shoes.\\
211 - Now, what were you thinking,
leaving kids alone with a keg?\\
212 - Look, Red, I've never
really been a dad before.\\
213 - I'm just trying to...\\
214 - I don't know, take it easy,
be his friend.\\
215 - Why would you be friends
with a 17-year-old?\\
216 - They're idiots.\\
217 - Bud, being a teenager
is like being in combat.\\
218 - One minute you're crawling
around half-blind,\\
219 - the next, you're looking
for your own foot.\\
220 - - Follow me?
- Not really.\\
221 - I was a conscientious Canadian.\\
222 - Well, if you weren't chicken,
and you did fight,\\
223 - who would you want as
your lieutenant, me or you?\\
224 - Well, you, 'cause you're
mean and scary.\\
225 - That's right. Steven doesn't
need another friend, Bud.\\
226 - Steven needs
somebody to ride his ass.\\
227 - He may not like it.
He may not thank you for it.\\
228 - He may do impressions of you
behind your back.\\
229 - He thinks he's so damn funny.\\
230 - But the point is,\\
231 - he'll know right from wrong
because you did your job.\\
232 - Bread, ham, bananas, milk,\\
233 - because there are
four food groups, Bud, four!\\
234 - I am so grossed out.\\
235 - I need a Calgon bath, a facial,
some Tater Tots, and some Jean Nate.\\
236 - - This night was the worst.
- I know.\\
237 - I mean, I am not
gonna find love in a bar.\\
238 - All I'm gonna find there are
guys who used to French my mom.\\
239 - I mean, just this morning, I was
playing with my Pretty Ponies.\\
240 - And look what you've
done to me, Donna, look!\\
241 - Me?\\
242 - I'm not the one who hooked up
with the Volunteer Fire Department.\\
243 - I am never gonna meet anybody,\\
244 - and I'm never,
ever gonna feel better, ever.\\
245 - Jackie, when you're sad, you
look exactly like Mary Tyler Moore.\\
246 - Oh, my God! Donna, I do!\\
247 - I am gonna make it after all!\\
248 - Damn!\\
249 - Okay, everybody, here we go.\\
250 - Now, if I catch on fire,
you promise to put me out?\\
251 - Well, I'm sure someone will.
Right, guys?\\
252 - Okay, great.\\
253 - Steven, I gotta talk...\\
254 - - What the hell are you doing?
- It is complicated.\\
255 - All right, that's it.
Party's over. Everybody out.\\
256 - What the hell
are you doing, Bud?\\
257 - Steven, this place
is a madhouse.\\
258 - The kids are all over the place, and
this guy could've burst into flames.\\
259 - Well, we'll never know now,
will we, Bud?\\
260 - Look, Eric went home so drunk,
he threw up all over Red's shoes.\\
261 - That's good stuff.\\
262 - No, it's not good stuff. And you
know what else? It's forbidden.\\
263 - So, what, you're, like,
trying to play father now?\\
264 - I'm not playing.
I am your father.\\
265 - You wanna stay here,
you're gonna do what I tell you.\\
266 - - Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.\\
267 - I'll be damned\\
268 - if you're gonna end up looking
for your own foot on my watch!\\
269 - Now, clean up all this crap, take the
trash out, and eat a banana, dumb ass!\\
270 - Now he's all strict.\\
271 - I gotta do my homework, and
he keeps talking about nutrition.\\
272 - So, I guess, what I'm hearing
from all this is,\\
273 - Hyde loves his daddy.\\
274 - - Shut up, Forman. I do not.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do.\\
275 - And Daddy loves his little Hyde.\\
276 - And that's why he yells
at him, and tucks him into bed\\
277 - and puts on his little footsie pajamas,
and reads him bedtime stories!\\
278 - Hey, thanks, Steven.
I'll take over from here.\\
279 - - Now, about last night.
- You know what, Dad?\\
280 - Before you get started,
I know what you're gonna say.\\
281 - Oh, really?\\
282 - What do you know?\\
283 - That I was irresponsible
and stupid.\\
284 - And I have it
on good authority that I\\
285 - may have called you something.\\
286 - Like, um,
"big, bald party pooper"?\\
287 - For instance. But the point
is, Dad, I'm really ashamed\\
288 - and sorry and afraid.\\
289 - Hmm.\\
290 - Okay. Well, that covers it.\\
291 - Okay, good talk.\\
292 - That's it?
I get off scot-free?\\
293 - I mean,
I learnt a valuable lesson?\\
294 - Look, Son, you're grown up now.\\
295 - You know what you did wrong.\\
296 - And I am too tired to keep thinking up
new and exciting ways to punish you.\\
297 - So, merry Christmas.\\
298 - Are you kidding me?\\
299 - I don't get in trouble, and you're
giving me a Christmas present?\\
300 - Oh, boy, this is
the best Christmas ever!\\
301 - Actually, you know,
this really smells.\\
302 - Yeah, those are my shoes
from last night.\\
303 - Clean them, buff them,
and shine them.\\
304 - Ho-ho-ho!\\
305 - Dumb ass!\\
306 - Damn.\\
307 - Damn it.\\
308 - Oh, come on!
\subsection {Episode 10: Ice Shack}
1 - Well...\\
2 - Okay. Now that we're all in the van,
and you guys can't change your mind,\\
3 - I just want you to know
that we're not exactly\\
4 - on the way to my uncle's
fabulous cabin in the woods.\\
5 - It's really
more of an ice shack.\\
6 - Did you say "ice shack"?\\
7 - Hmm?\\
8 - Yeah. Oh, and the hot tub,\\
9 - it's really
more of a garbage can.\\
10 - But it's also
the bathroom, so...\\
11 - - Kelso, turn this van around.
- No, Donna, wait.\\
12 - - Is there beer?
- Tons.\\
13 - Hey, and we don't even need a
refrigerator 'cause it's so freaking cold.\\
14 - - Paradise.
- Yeah.\\
15 - Oh, and before
we pick up Jackie,\\
16 - I just want to make sure everybody
knows what this trip is about.\\
17 - The fabulous hot-tub toilet?\\
18 - No. Eric, tell her
about my master plan.\\
19 - Oh, yeah. See, Kelso, when you start a
sentence with the words "master plan,"\\
20 - I just kind of know it's gonna be
stupid, so I just naturally tune out.\\
21 - Okay, well, my master plan is...\\
22 - Eric! Pay attention!\\
23 - This is about
a romantic double date.\\
24 - It's you and Donna
and me and Jackie.\\
25 - Kelso, you do know you're not
actually dating Jackie, right?\\
26 - That's why
it's a secret double date.\\
27 - See, I told Jackie that
the whole gang was coming,\\
28 - but then I didn't invite Hyde,\\
29 - and especially not Fez,
'cause he's all over Jackie.\\
30 - Look, I'm not doing this.
Turn this van around.\\
31 - No. I need you guys.
See, if you're there...\\
32 - You guys are, like,
the perfect couple.\\
33 - And if you're there,\\
34 - then I can just copy all the sissy,
loser things that Eric does for you.\\
35 - I really do enjoy
your sissy, loser things.\\
36 - Yeah, like when I had first dibs
on that seat but I took the hump.\\
37 - So, it's a small price to pay
to keep my lady happy.\\
38 - Exactly!
I want to be that dork.\\
39 - - Kelso, why are you
speeding up?
- I gotta beat this light.\\
40 - - Why?
- I just... I gotta!\\
41 - Damn it!\\
42 - What are you doing?\\
43 - I've been chasing you
for six blocks.\\
44 - I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't see you.\\
45 - Yeah, nice try. I know
all about your master plan.\\
46 - Now, drive,
you sneaky son of a bitch.\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - We're all, all right\\
54 - We're all, all right\\
55 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
56 - You brought me to an outhouse?\\
57 - Actually, Jackie,
that's the outhouse.\\
58 - No. No, it's an ice shack
for fishing.\\
59 - This is gonna be a blast.\\
60 - I mean, it is so beautiful
out here.\\
61 - Plus, I brought lotion.\\
62 - It's kind of cold.\\
63 - Oh, here, take my jacket.\\
64 - I love you.\\
65 - God, we are such
the perfect couple.\\
66 - I'm cold, too.\\
67 - Well, damn, Jackie.
I can't control the weather.\\
68 - Here, Jackie, take my coat.\\
69 - Oh, thanks, Fez!\\
70 - So, sweetie,
what do you want to do?\\
71 - Whatever you want to do, honey.\\
72 - - I want to go inside.
- That's what
I want to do, too.\\
73 - Oh, my God! Let's go.\\
74 - Hey, what the hell was that
jacket business, man?\\
75 - You're making me look bad.\\
76 - Look, Kelso, you are
my good, good friend,\\
77 - but I will stop at nothing
to win Jackie.\\
78 - And if you're in my way,
I will destroy you.\\
79 - - This is nice,
you coming home for lunch.
- Yeah.\\
80 - Good afternoon, sunshine.\\
81 - So, what have you
got planned for today?\\
82 - Same as every day.\\
83 - Lie on the couch, do my nails,
avoid talking to you.\\
84 - It's not going that well,
so far.\\
85 - Red, that girl does nothing but
party all night and sleep all day.\\
86 - She's gonna end up
like Aunt Martha.\\
87 - Remember the beer gut on her?\\
88 - She's not gonna end up
like Fat Martha.\\
89 - Poor woman got so large
she couldn't play Putt-Putt.\\
90 - Jeez, don't remind me.\\
91 - That par two was the longest
three hours of my life.\\
92 - Red, your daughter is drifting.
So what are you gonna do?\\
93 - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.\\
94 - I'm gonna start eating
my lunch in the office.\\
95 - Leo, man, glad you're here.
I've been really busy.\\
96 - Oh, yeah?\\
97 - I guess my "buy one, get one free"
flyer is really bringing in the business.\\
98 - That's 'cause you forgot
the "buy one" part.\\
99 - Oh, no. Well, good thing
we're closing early, man,\\
100 - 'cause I need you to give me
a ride over to my cousin Larry's.\\
101 - - I don't have a car, man.
- You can drive mine, man.\\
102 - I can't drive since my license
got suspended.\\
103 - Why? What'd you do?\\
104 - Well, I dropped it
in some soda, you know.\\
105 - And it just hung there,
suspended.\\
106 - And then when I was looking
at it I ran a red light.\\
107 - Boy, ice fishing's fun.\\
108 - I like this place, out here in
the middle of a frozen lake.\\
109 - It's cozy.
Don't you think, Jackie?\\
110 - If by "cozy," you mean
"small and smelly," then, yes!\\
111 - Good one, Jackie.\\
112 - That's funny.\\
113 - Well, she needs a sense of humor
with an unfaithful ex-boyfriend,\\
114 - who brings her
to a dump like this.\\
115 - Ow.\\
116 - - Nice.
- Thank you.\\
117 - I mean, Eric would never
take Donna to a place like this.\\
118 - Fez, it wouldn't matter where we
were. Just being together makes it fun.\\
119 - But I would never bring you
to a place like this,\\
120 - because I know that you don't
like such small, smelly places.\\
121 - - You know me so well.
- Eskimo kiss.\\
122 - Too bad Kelso doesn't know
anything about Jackie.\\
123 - Whoa. That is not true.
I know everything about her.\\
124 - In fact, I'll bet I know more about
Jackie than Eric knows about Donna.\\
125 - Whoa, Kelso,
walk before you run, baby.\\
126 - You think you know me,
Michael? Then prove it.\\
127 - Oh, I have an idea.\\
128 - Let's play The Newlywed Game.\\
129 - Eric and Donna
versus Kelso and Jackie.\\
130 - And I will be the impartial
judge who gets Jackie in the end.\\
131 - - What?
- I mean,
good luck to everyone.\\
132 - Hey, Leo,
what's in the bag, man?\\
133 - How can I put this?\\
134 - Let's just say,
in this bag are illegal drugs.\\
135 - What? Come on, man.
You know I'm on probation!\\
136 - No, it's cool, man.\\
137 - All you have to do
is just not get pulled over.\\
138 - What did I just tell you, man?\\
139 - Gentlemen, our ladies
have already written down\\
140 - the answers to their questions.\\
141 - First up, Eric.\\
142 - Eric, what is Donna's
favorite pizza topping?\\
143 - Pepperoni.\\
144 - - Donna?
- Pepperoni!\\
145 - - We are such
the perfect couple.
- I know.\\
146 - - Now, Kelso...
- Mushrooms.\\
147 - No, no, no, no, no.
That is not your question.\\
148 - And minus two
for interrupting the host.\\
149 - - Minus two.
- Okay, sorry.\\
150 - It's okay. Minus two.\\
151 - Now, Kelso, last summer
you "accidentally"\\
152 - bounced Jackie off a trampoline.\\
153 - When she woke up in the
hospital, what were her first words?\\
154 - Oh! "Michael, you idiot."\\
155 - Michael, you remembered!\\
156 - Swell, he remembered.\\
157 - Okay, Eric, according to Donna,
what is Donna's last name?\\
158 - Pinciotti.\\
159 - Oh, my God!\\
160 - Yes!\\
161 - Correct!\\
162 - Now, Kelso...\\
163 - Jackie has distant relatives
in the Cook Islands.\\
164 - In the early 1900s, what species of
turtle did they save from extinction?\\
165 - Take your time.\\
166 - Ladderback.\\
167 - Michael, you're amazing!\\
168 - No, no, no! No hugging.\\
169 - I'm sorry, all right?
I forgot.\\
170 - That's right. And let's try
to remember that, little lady.\\
171 - Well, the score
is horribly close.\\
172 - - I'm very impressed, Michael.
- Yeah, well...\\
173 - I guess you just remember
things about those you care about.\\
174 - Oh, please. I'm gonna puke.\\
175 - Let's get this nightmare
over with.\\
176 - Okay, Donna,\\
177 - if you could change one thing
about yourself, what would it be?\\
178 - Um...\\
179 - Well, there's stuff I'd change. But I
know Eric, and he'd say "Nothing."\\
180 - No, but... Wait.
But that's not the question.\\
181 - Why? What'd you answer?\\
182 - It doesn't matter what I answered,
because you answered wrong.\\
183 - And I don't want to
play anymore.\\
184 - "Huge Wile E. Coyote feet"?\\
185 - What the hell does that mean?\\
186 - It means you have
enormous feet. Jackie?\\
187 - Whoa, whoa, Fez.\\
188 - Eric, you think
I have enormous feet?\\
189 - No. No, no, you think that.\\
190 - Last week, you said you hated
your "huge Wile E. Coyote feet."\\
191 - Eric, I only said that
so you'd say they're not big.\\
192 - And they're not big.\\
193 - I'm sorry.
But, dude, that's a lie.\\
194 - Oh, my God!
I don't believe this.\\
195 - No! Donna, no, you're looking
at this all wrong.\\
196 - Big feet make you,
like, really stable. You know?\\
197 - Really hard to knock over.\\
198 - Get bent.\\
199 - See? I have small feet.\\
200 - That's where... Donna? Are
you going somewhere, honey?\\
201 - Okay, this is it.\\
202 - For all the marbles.\\
203 - Jackie, what was your answer?\\
204 - Um...\\
205 - Well, if I had to change
one thing about me,\\
206 - it would have to be that\\
207 - I'm too cute and all other
girls are jealous.\\
208 - Kelso?\\
209 - Oh, my God, Michael!
That's amazing.\\
210 - Oh, my God, I almost... Oh,
my God. I gotta go talk to Donna.\\
211 - Who would know that you would
win a battle of wits?\\
212 - Yeah.\\
213 - Turns out that the key
to winning Jackie's heart\\
214 - was in the last place
I thought to look,\\
215 - my own brain.\\
216 - Donna, I think I'm actually feeling
something for Michael, you know?\\
217 - Donna, would you please stop
looking at your feet and listen to me?\\
218 - A boyfriend is supposed
to tell you\\
219 - the things you don't like
about yourself are fine.\\
220 - Like last week, I told Eric
his pecs were getting bigger.\\
221 - But I mean, come on.\\
222 - If you lie him on his back, you
could fill up his chest with water.\\
223 - Maybe I'm just lonely.\\
224 - Or I need a sign from,
like, God.\\
225 - Or I don't know.\\
226 - Maybe I just need someone
to tell me if I'm crazy.\\
227 - Jackie, you're crazy.\\
228 - Not you, Bigfoot.\\
229 - Hi, honey. How was...\\
230 - Oh, not over yet.\\
231 - No, it's not, Red.\\
232 - Go make Laurie do something
with her life.\\
233 - I mean it. Now!\\
234 - You know, when a guy
comes home from work,\\
235 - he just wants to sit down
and have a nice, quiet beer.\\
236 - Well, she drank your beer
because she doesn't have a future.\\
237 - Fine, Kitty. I'm going.\\
238 - Okay, honey. First of all,\\
239 - always save one beer for Daddy.\\
240 - - Okay.
- Second of all,\\
241 - we feel that you need to get
some direction in your life.\\
242 - And by "we," I mean your mother.\\
243 - See, honey,
I'm not really worried.\\
244 - 'Cause I know you're gonna
find a nice guy and get married.\\
245 - - Exactly.
- Right.\\
246 - Someone who can
take care of you.\\
247 - Who's rich. Who's not Kelso.\\
248 - And I think this is a plan that
might just work out for you.\\
249 - Okay.\\
250 - But, Daddy, I mean, if I wanted to
have a career of my own, I could, right?\\
251 - Well, sure.\\
252 - I just don't want you
to set yourself up for...\\
253 - Like what happened
at the college.\\
254 - If you set the bar too high,
the fall might be...\\
255 - You see, you're just so pretty.\\
256 - Here's $5.\\
257 - Good evening, gentlemen.\\
258 - Is there a problem, ossifer?\\
259 - Did you just say "ossifer"?\\
260 - No, sir, I'm sorry. I distinctly
heard him say "officer", sir.\\
261 - Uh-huh.\\
262 - I pulled you over because
your left brake light is out.\\
263 - I'm gonna have to write you up
a warning.\\
264 - Close one, man.\\
265 - I thought for sure he was
gonna ask what's in the bag.\\
266 - I'm still right here.\\
267 - Uh-oh.\\
268 - - Dog food?
- We were framed.\\
269 - I mean, of course it's dog food.\\
270 - What'd you think it was?
Illegal drugs?\\
271 - All right, weirdos.\\
272 - Drive safe.\\
273 - Dog food?\\
274 - Yeah. I mean... Oh, wait, man.\\
275 - If the dog's food in this bag,
then where's...\\
276 - Oh, wow. I gotta
check on my dog, man.\\
277 - - Jackie, I...
- Don't speak, Michael.\\
278 - I am very close to letting
myself experience\\
279 - strong feelings
of not hating you.\\
280 - - I just need a sign.
- I brought the lotion.\\
281 - No. Okay, I want you to guess
a number between one and ten.\\
282 - - Seven.
- Guess again.\\
283 - - Three.
- Close enough. Let's go.\\
284 - Jackie, if you go out
that door with him,\\
285 - whatever we might have had
between us is over forever.\\
286 - Look. The reason I haven't
done anything with my life\\
287 - is because I didn't know
what I wanted to do.\\
288 - Well, the post office
has a dental plan that's...\\
289 - But, Daddy, you forced me to
sit down and think about it.\\
290 - And now I have
found my passion. Hair!\\
291 - The musical?\\
292 - No, hair!\\
293 - I'm going to beauty school.\\
294 - This isn't something you do
through the mail, is it?\\
295 - No. It's a real school.\\
296 - Oh, well, yay!\\
297 - Congratulations, sweetheart.\\
298 - So, Kitty, what do you think?\\
299 - Yeah.\\
300 - Well, looks like Jackie
and Kelso are back together.\\
301 - I won and Fez lost.
I won and Fez lost.\\
302 - - You guys, what happened?
- I don't know.\\
303 - All of a sudden
the van just started shaking.\\
304 - Uh... Guys?\\
305 - Quick! Everyone give me your
belts. Together, we can pull it out.\\
306 - Come on!\\
307 - Michael, this is it. This is
the sign I was looking for.\\
308 - God doesn't want us
to be together.\\
309 - Who cares? I'm losing my van.\\
310 - See? That was always
the problem with us, Michael.\\
311 - It was always about you.\\
312 - - Jackie, are you losing
your van?
- No.\\
313 - Then shut up!\\
314 - Wow, watching Kelso's van sink\\
315 - makes the size of my feet
seem unimportant.\\
316 - See, Donna, size doesn't matter.\\
317 - - You don't have to tell me.
- That's... Yeah, right.\\
318 - There's my sweet girl.\\
319 - Fez, I'm cold.\\
320 - Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a rat's ass.\\
321 - Dr. Zhivago, I'm home!\\
322 - I brought your food.

1 - Where's the tunes, Forman?\\
2 - Hang on, you guys.
Just one more wire here.\\
3 - I learnt how to speak English
faster than this.\\
4 - Fez, it's not real English when
you speak it with a foreign accent.\\
5 - Jeez.\\
6 - Aren't these the coolest?\\
7 - I can't hear you.\\
8 - I know. They're the
greatest speakers ever.\\
9 - Eric!\\
10 - Oh, hey, Dad. Sorry.\\
11 - Didn't see you there.\\
12 - Well, I guess that's 'cause you were
too busy making an ass of yourself.\\
13 - Actually, I was trying out
my new speakers.\\
14 - - What do you think?
- New speakers?\\
15 - What was wrong with the old
ones? Those were genuine GM parts.\\
16 - Uh...\\
17 - These are louder.\\
18 - Yeah, well, just keep your
monkey music turned down.\\
19 - And go grab your smock.
We gotta go to work.\\
20 - Hey, Red. Is that you?\\
21 - Oh, cripes.\\
22 - Hiya, neighbor!\\
23 - Can't hear you, Bob. I'm
testing out Eric's new speakers.\\
24 - Not bad.\\
25 - Hanging out\\
26 - Down the street\\
27 - The same old thing\\
28 - We did last week\\
29 - Not a thing to do\\
30 - But talk to you\\
31 - We're all, all right\\
32 - We're all, all right\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - Boy, quite a day at
Price Mart, Kitty.\\
35 - First, the price of light
bulbs dropped two cents,\\
36 - then Eric was made
employee of the month,\\
37 - and to top it off, they added
Cheez-Its to the vending machine.\\
38 - Are you serious?\\
39 - Yep.\\
40 - Tiny little squares with the
cheese flavor baked right in.\\
41 - Am I really Price Mart
employee of the month?\\
42 - You sure are.\\
43 - Yay!\\
44 - And they even
decided to throw in\\
45 - an extra 25 cents an hour.\\
46 - Oh, yes.\\
47 - I gotta admit, Eric.
I had my doubts,\\
48 - but, hell,
you've hardly embarrassed me.\\
49 - Thanks, Dad.\\
50 - Oh, this is great. Whoo!
Price Mart rocks.\\
51 - Oh, Laurie,
tell everyone your good news.\\
52 - I just finished my first two
weeks of cosmetology school.\\
53 - And she didn't flunk out.\\
54 - Isn't that great?\\
55 - That is great, honey.
Nice job.\\
56 - Thanks, Daddy.\\
57 - Yeah, but the next
exam is gonna kill me.\\
58 - We're not allowed to practice
on dummies anymore\\
59 - - and I have to style
a real person's hair.
- Oh, honey, you'll do fine.\\
60 - - We're all here
to support you.
- Great.\\
61 - So, you don't
mind being my model?\\
62 - Me?\\
63 - Oh, honey, no, no.
I go to the beauty parlor.\\
64 - Okay, well, well,
maybe Eric can help out.\\
65 - Oh, sure. Laurie, first of
all, always run with scissors.\\
66 - Boy, I never get
tired of your sarcasm.\\
67 - Really?\\
68 - Sorry.\\
69 - Red, would you like
to be a hair model?\\
70 - Kitty, I would like
to have hair. Period.\\
71 - But, I don't. So, no.\\
72 - Oh, forget it.\\
73 - I don't even know why I
picked this stupid career.\\
74 - Maybe it's because
you're stupid.\\
75 - Laurie, no.\\
76 - You quit everything. You are
not quitting cosmetology school.\\
77 - Well, what am I supposed to do?\\
78 - I will be your model.\\
79 - But you just remember.\\
80 - Men have their cars.
Women have their hair.\\
81 - It's like a car.
It's valuable.\\
82 - So, not only are they gonna hang
my picture in the front of the store,\\
83 - but I also get to represent
our entire district\\
84 - in the national
Price Mart Olympics.\\
85 - That's nice.\\
86 - Do you think I would choke to
death if I swallowed my straw?\\
87 - No, it's got a breathing hole.\\
88 - - Fez, no.
- Fez, no.\\
89 - Oh, my God. There she is.\\
90 - - Who's that?
- The new girl, Caroline.\\
91 - She transferred here from Sacred
Heart. Or heaven, I'm not sure which.\\
92 - We have gym together.
She barely sweats.\\
93 - Someday,
I will make her my bride.\\
94 - Yep, no one likes
a sweaty bride.\\
95 - - Yeah, I hear you.
- So true.\\
96 - Hey, why don't you
go talk to her, man?\\
97 - Oh, I, uh...\\
98 - You're the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.\\
99 - Thank you. Your cocoa-brown
skin makes me hot.\\
100 - I know.\\
101 - I am irresistible.
Would you like to dance?\\
102 - Hey, why don't you
go talk to her, man?\\
103 - Oh, I don't know, Hyde, I
can't. I don't understand this.\\
104 - Usually, I am...
I am suave. I am silky.\\
105 - But this girl makes me...\\
106 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
107 - Anyway, getting back
to Price Mart...\\
108 - - Shut up!
- Yeah.\\
109 - Oh, my God. You guys
are never gonna believe this.\\
110 - - Wait, no. Me first.
- Okay, go.\\
111 - Okay. I, Eric Forman,\\
112 - your boyfriend,\\
113 - am Price Mart's newest
employee of the month.\\
114 - Eric, that's great.
Are you done?\\
115 - Oh, yeah. Top that, cupcake.\\
116 - Okay.\\
117 - I just won two tickets
to the Led Zeppelin concert.\\
118 - I was caller number
seven and I won\\
119 - and we're going to Zeppelin
on Tuesday night.\\
120 - All right!\\
121 - She said two tickets, not four,
you moron. We're not going.\\
122 - Oh, my God, no.
Did you say Tuesday night?\\
123 - I... I can't go Tuesday night. It's
inventory night. It's mandatory.\\
124 - Skip it, Eric.
You love Zeppelin.\\
125 - Call in sick. Tell them your
grandma died. Burn down the store.\\
126 - You're right.
You know, what? I'm going.\\
127 - - I can't go.
- Then who am I gonna take?\\
128 - - No, Donna...
- You shut your filthy mouth.\\
129 - - Whoa, whoa. Donna, seriously...
- I'm practically his brother.\\
130 - - Hey, I've been his
friend way longer!
- Hey, you know what?\\
131 - I am going.\\
132 - Oh, crap.\\
133 - - Still friends?
- Till death.\\
134 - I can't go.\\
135 - - I'm in!
- Get killed!\\
136 - Shut up!\\
137 - Uh...\\
138 - - Eric, are you sure
you can't come?
- Yeah, I can't.\\
139 - You know, everyone has
to work. No exceptions.\\
140 - Plus, Red and I, we're
both kind of supervising.\\
141 - Corporate America
claims another victim.\\
142 - Eric, it's okay.\\
143 - I knew you weren't gonna go.
You're a really responsible guy.\\
144 - I love and hate that about you.\\
145 - Well, since Mr. Smock here
is being all logical,\\
146 - I guess I'll have to
take one of you losers.\\
147 - - Take a loser where?
- Zeppelin.\\
148 - Zeppelin? Oh, my God.
That's a band, right?\\
149 - Donna...\\
150 - In the ninth grade, I did an oral
report on Stairway to Heaven\\
151 - and I got a B-plus.\\
152 - You gotta take me.\\
153 - Donna, in the ninth grade,
I wasn't a dork\\
154 - and I didn't write a report
on Stairway to Heaven,\\
155 - and you gotta take me.\\
156 - God, she doesn't wanna take
either one of you,\\
157 - 'cause she's taking me.
Donna, M-E. Me.\\
158 - Okay, you know what?
I'm going.\\
159 - I can't.\\
160 - - You hate it, don't you?
- No, no. It's interesting.\\
161 - I mean,
just look at all this body.\\
162 - I must... I bet, I'm... I'm
like... I'm four inches taller.\\
163 - I never should've
gotten into this.\\
164 - I'm not good at anything.\\
165 - No, no, no.\\
166 - I like it, Laurie.\\
167 - Really?\\
168 - Thanks, Mum.
Now all you need is a cut.\\
169 - No, no. No, no. No. Length...
Length is good. Length is good.\\
170 - Drop 'em.\\
171 - Oh, hey, did you see this?\\
172 - They gave me
a Price Mart key chain.\\
173 - It's got a knife and everything.\\
174 - Yeah, I keep it in my pocket.
Some of the other guys get jealous.\\
175 - Look, Eric, I know you're very
excited about your raise and everything,\\
176 - but I don't want you to get
too caught up in this.\\
177 - Don't worry, Dad.\\
178 - I'm not about to alienate
my fellow employees\\
179 - with my award-winning
work ethic.\\
180 - I read the signs in the break
room. There's no "I" in teamwork.\\
181 - Here's your check, sir, and
thank you for eating at Smiley's.\\
182 - - Very funny.
- You know what, Dad? I got this.\\
183 - Take your hand off the check.\\
184 - I'll come back.\\
185 - Jackie, why do you wanna go
anyway? You hate Led Zeppelin.\\
186 - I never said
I hated them, Michael.\\
187 - For your information,
I think Led is hot.\\
188 - - Fez, is that her?
- Yes.\\
189 - I wish I could go talk to her,
but I get so nervous.\\
190 - Fez, you shouldn't be nervous.
You're awesome.\\
191 - What girl wouldn't
wanna be with you?\\
192 - Well, there is Jackie, Laurie,\\
193 - this girl from gym,
another girl from chemistry,\\
194 - Country-Western
star Tanya Tucker,\\
195 - who does not answer her letters.\\
196 - Okay, stop.\\
197 - Whatever happened
to suave, silky Fez?\\
198 - You're right.
I forgot about him.\\
199 - He's hot.\\
200 - Exactly. So, go get her, Fez.\\
201 - Caroline, it is Fez.
May I sit?\\
202 - Okay, thank you.\\
203 - Great idea, Donna.\\
204 - Well, excuse me for trying
to buy a co-worker lunch.\\
205 - I am not your co-worker.\\
206 - You're a high school kid
with a part-time job.\\
207 - You're temporary.\\
208 - Uh-oh!\\
209 - You know what ends fights?
Pudding.\\
210 - Just give me seven minutes.\\
211 - Eric, you gotta stop
acting like a big shot.\\
212 - You're not the king
of the world, you know.\\
213 - I'm employee of the month.
I don't have to take this.\\
214 - This is no good, Kitty.\\
215 - Well, what are you gonna
do, Red? He's growing up.\\
216 - No, I mean your hair.\\
217 - Hey there, Harpo.\\
218 - Where's your horn?\\
219 - Bob, are you
making fun of my hair?\\
220 - No.\\
221 - - Take me.
- Take me.\\
222 - - Take me.
- No.\\
223 - - Take me.
- Take me.\\
224 - - Take me.
- No.\\
225 - - Hi.
- Hi.\\
226 - - You're Donna, right?
- Yeah, yeah.\\
227 - I'm Caroline. I think we
have Spanish together.\\
228 - - Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Hola.\\
229 - Um...\\
230 - You know that foreign guy
you're always hanging out with?\\
231 - - Fez?
- Yeah. Fez.\\
232 - Is he...\\
233 - - Does he...
- Oh, my God. You like Fez?\\
234 - Oh, my God. Come on,
I'll introduce you to him.\\
235 - Oh, no, no. That's okay.
I just wanted to...\\
236 - I gotta go. Use the bano.\\
237 - Stupid,
stupid, stupid.\\
238 - What's going on?\\
239 - Cosmetology is too hard.\\
240 - I'm quitting.\\
241 - Laurie, don't you think I wanted to
quit nursing school a hundred times?\\
242 - The first time I put in
a catheter, it broke off.\\
243 - But what if I don't
get any better?\\
244 - Well, you will never know
unless you stick with it.\\
245 - What do you care?\\
246 - I care because I'm your mother.\\
247 - So, I care.\\
248 - Well, we do start
doing nails next week.\\
249 - That might be fun.\\
250 - And I happen to know a few
patients down at the hospital\\
251 - who would love a manicure.\\
252 - - Thanks, Mum.
- Mmm-hmm.\\
253 - Yep. It's just gonna perk them right
up when they come out of their comas.\\
254 - Hey, Dad. Good news.\\
255 - Just got another raise.\\
256 - Well, good for you.\\
257 - You dumb bastard.\\
258 - Yeah, I tell you.\\
259 - If they keep throwing money
at me like this,\\
260 - I might be able to get
my own apartment soon.\\
261 - For God's sake,
you're 57 years old.\\
262 - Oh...\\
263 - Eric, why didn't you
listen to me?\\
264 - If you'd gone to college, you
could've really been something.\\
265 - Been something? Whoa.\\
266 - You're talking to the interim
assistant weekend manager\\
267 - of housewares here, okay?\\
268 - Yeah. Show some respect.\\
269 - Well, aren't you just
the president of Turd Town?\\
270 - Dad.\\
271 - I've been thinking about why
you went so crazy and yelled at me\\
272 - and I've come to
the conclusion that\\
273 - you're crazy and you
like to yell at me.\\
274 - There's something you
gotta know. You're... Well...\\
275 - You're an idiot.\\
276 - Oh, great. A pep talk.\\
277 - Sit down.\\
278 - When I was your age,
I thought I had it all, too.\\
279 - Great job at the plants,
nice steady paycheck.\\
280 - Just enough to, you know,
string me along for 30 years or so,\\
281 - and for what?\\
282 - So they could toss me out on
my ass when things got tough.\\
283 - - Dad, I'm not gonna...
- Look.\\
284 - Don't get me wrong.
I admire your work ethic,\\
285 - but you deserve
better than Price Mart.\\
286 - You're a smart guy.\\
287 - And I'm... I'm proud of you.\\
288 - Whoa!\\
289 - Really?\\
290 - You... You think I'm smart?\\
291 - - You're proud of me?
- Oh, jeez.\\
292 - What, you gonna ruin
this now by talking?\\
293 - Listen, Dad...\\
294 - If I'm still working at Price
Mart when I'm your... Older.\\
295 - Please kill me.\\
296 - You don't have
to ask twice, Son.\\
297 - Ah, yes.\\
298 - - That's my dad.
- Come on.\\
299 - Let's go make fun
of your mom's hair.\\
300 - - Jerk.
- Wench.\\
301 - - Tool.
- Dillhole.\\
302 - - Moron.
- Moron.\\
303 - I already said moron.\\
304 - Moron.\\
305 - Don't touch.
Those are for Donna.\\
306 - Kelso, Donna doesn't want
a bunch of dirty cookies.\\
307 - They're not dirty.\\
308 - They are now.\\
309 - Hyde, you're dead.\\
310 - Oh, my God.\\
311 - Donna, where have you been?\\
312 - The concert starts in an hour.
Come on, I'm ready to go. Let's go.\\
313 - The concert?
Oh, right. The concert.\\
314 - Well, you guys were so busy fighting
over the tickets, I forgot to tell you.\\
315 - I gave them away.\\
316 - - What?
- No.\\
317 - To who?\\
318 - See? Your cuticles
look better already.\\
319 - Proper nail care is one of
the easiest things to overlook.\\
320 - Real good.\\
321 - Oh, gosh, Daddy. I didn't
know you were a bleeder.\\
322 - I'm not.\\
323 - Could you apply
some pressure to this\\
324 - while I go get some
paper towels?
\subsection {Episode 13: Dine and Dash}
1 - Hey, guys, guess what I got.\\
2 - VD?\\
3 - No.\\
4 - A 100 bucks.\\
5 - So money to treat your VD?\\
6 - No. My grandmother
gave me this money.\\
7 - See, my mom told her that she
needed to bleach her whiskers.\\
8 - And I was like...
I go, "What whiskers?"\\
9 - Which is a total lie, because
she's got these honking whiskers.\\
10 - But then it made her so happy
she gave me a 100 bucks.\\
11 - No offense, Michael, but your
mum's not one to talk. I mean...\\
12 - Whoo!\\
13 - Hey! My mother is
a beautiful woman.\\
14 - Apologize.\\
15 - - Sorry.
- She's nice.\\
16 - - Sorry.
- Whisker face.\\
17 - All right, thank you!\\
18 - Now we gotta go
celebrate this 100 bucks.\\
19 - Let's all go out to dinner. Someplace
expensive. Someplace nice.\\
20 - Let's go to the Vineyard.\\
21 - My new ladylove,
Caroline, works there.\\
22 - Caroline from the concert?\\
23 - - Have you guys gone out again?
- No.\\
24 - - So, have you guys
hung out at school?
- No.\\
25 - - Talked on the phone?
- No.\\
26 - - Have you had any
contact with her at all?
- No.\\
27 - - So Caroline's your new lady?
- Yes.\\
28 - - That's great.
- Thank you.\\
29 - There she is.
Isn't she lovely?\\
30 - She reminds me of that song
Isn't She Lovely.\\
31 - Here she comes. Here she
comes. Watch me impress her.\\
32 - - Hi, Fez.
- Hello,
Caroline.\\
33 - - I just came over to say hi.
- Hi.\\
34 - - Hi! Bye.
- Bye.\\
35 - Did you see how I played her?\\
36 - Hey, Kelso, thanks for dinner.
It was great.\\
37 - - Yeah, it was delicious.
- Thanks so much.\\
38 - Hey, guys, no need to
thank me. I'm happy to do it.\\
39 - Okay. Everybody ready?\\
40 - Don't you have to pay first?\\
41 - - I'm not paying.
- What?\\
42 - What, did you think
I was paying?\\
43 - - Yes. Kelso,
we don't have any money.
- You don't need any.\\
44 - People, we are on
a "dine and dash" here.\\
45 - Yeah, 'cause the only thing
better than eating lobster\\
46 - is eating lobster
and hauling ass.\\
47 - Let's haul ass.\\
48 - Hanging out\\
49 - Down the street\\
50 - The same old thing\\
51 - We did last week\\
52 - Not a thing to do\\
53 - But talk to you\\
54 - We're all, all right\\
55 - We're all, all right\\
56 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
57 - Kelso, what the hell
are you thinking?\\
58 - You said you'd take care of it.\\
59 - And I took care of it by
planning the "dine and dash."\\
60 - - Kelso, we're not doing it.
- Why not?\\
61 - Guys, we're making
memories here.\\
62 - Kelso, it's wrong.\\
63 - Wrong? Or hilarious?\\
64 - Wrong, you dill-hole!\\
65 - Or hilariously wrong.
I like it.\\
66 - But then again, I'm from
the underbelly of society, so...\\
67 - Yes, excuse me.\\
68 - Would you please send your
finest imported beer to Caroline?\\
69 - And tell her that
when I said "Hi",\\
70 - what I meant was, "I'll
take you like a stallion."\\
71 - You got that? Like a stallion?\\
72 - Fez, stop ordering stuff.\\
73 - Okay, you need to
chill out, little girl.\\
74 - Didn't you hear Kelso?\\
75 - The Vineyard is having
a "dine and dash" promotion.\\
76 - Everything's free.\\
77 - It's not free, Fez.\\
78 - "Dine and dash" is when
you run out without paying.\\
79 - So it's stealing?\\
80 - This isn't going to help me
with Caroline, is it?\\
81 - Excuse me.\\
82 - Hey.\\
83 - That's from me,
you son of a bitch.\\
84 - Oh, good, honey, you're home.
Listen. The Pinciottis called.\\
85 - They wanted to have to
have card night tonight. So...\\
86 - No, Kitty, you just call them
back 'cause there's no way in hell\\
87 - that I'm gonna have card night
with the Pinciottis\\
88 - 'cause it's just too much fun.\\
89 - Hello, Bob and Midge.\\
90 - - What the hell
are they doing here?
- I don't know.\\
91 - So, who else needs
a drink real bad?\\
92 - Tough day at
the salt mines, Red?\\
93 - Oh. When did you get
a job at the salt mines?\\
94 - Here, honey. Play with these.\\
95 - Yeah. Working Joe.\\
96 - I'll tell you. Since my
business went bankrupt,\\
97 - I got a lot of free time.\\
98 - I mainly use it to nap and cry.\\
99 - Well, Bob,
don't cry on the cards.\\
100 - It makes them hard to shuffle.\\
101 - Michael, I have never dined
and dashed,\\
102 - and I'm not about to start now.\\
103 - Uh...\\
104 - Well, remember when
we went to nice restaurants\\
105 - and I told you to wait
in the car while I paid?\\
106 - Did you ever wonder
why I was running to the car?\\
107 - Oh, my God. I'm a thief.\\
108 - I think technically
you're an accessory.\\
109 - Which should make you happy,
because you love accessories.\\
110 - - Earrings, bracelets,
bangles, bows...
- Shut up!\\
111 - So, did you enjoy your Pilsner?\\
112 - Did you get the message
about the stallion?\\
113 - Okay, look, okay? You can't send
beer to the hostess podium, okay?\\
114 - I almost got fired. So just
pretend you don't know me, okay?\\
115 - I don't think I do
know you, Caroline.\\
116 - Caroline has upset me.\\
117 - I can't wait to dine
and dash on her ass,\\
118 - her beautiful ass.\\
119 - - I'll go first.
- Hyde, we're not doing this.\\
120 - And especially not you,
'cause you're on probation.\\
121 - - So what?
- So what? You get caught,\\
122 - you go to jail, and I've
heard nothing good about jail.\\
123 - I haven't done one stinking
illegal thing since I got probation.\\
124 - So, what, you're mad\\
125 - because you haven't committed
any crime since your last crime?\\
126 - Yeah, so I'm going.\\
127 - Can I help you?\\
128 - What happened?\\
129 - This place is like Alcatraz,
man. There's no way out.\\
130 - So it was either a UFO,
or I rubbed my eyes too hard.\\
131 - Okay. Good story, Midge.\\
132 - So, Red, how's work?\\
133 - Well, yesterday I hired some
new guy down in Sporting Goods,\\
134 - - but I don't know...
- Whoa. You hired a new guy?\\
135 - That's funny.\\
136 - I remember when I was doing the hiring
at my store, and you were out of work.\\
137 - I hired you, neighbor.\\
138 - - Listen, Bob...
- No.\\
139 - - Midgie, we're going home.
- But I have gin.\\
140 - We're playing bridge!\\
141 - I can't do it. I've gone
soft, man. I'm like Forman.\\
142 - It sickens me.\\
143 - Hmm. So you can't do it.
I wonder why.\\
144 - Why, oh, why?\\
145 - - Oh. I know why.
- Yes, Donna?\\
146 - - Because it's wrong.
- That's right, Miss Pinciotti. It's wrong.\\
147 - Gee, what a surprise. Mom
and Dad don't want to do it.\\
148 - We are not Mom and Dad.\\
149 - And we're not leaving
without paying, young man.\\
150 - Fine. Fine. I'll pay
for the stupid dinner.\\
151 - Now, just give me your stupid
keys so I can get my money\\
152 - out of your stupid car.\\
153 - Stupid.\\
154 - I don't care if you're in
the freaking Olympics\\
155 - about to run
the freaking 100-yard dash.\\
156 - If someone sends you a beer,
you say thank you\\
157 - and drink the freaking beer.\\
158 - Um, Eric, did Kelso
leave his money at home?\\
159 - 'Cause he just drove away
in the Vista Cruiser.\\
160 - What?\\
161 - No. No, he wouldn't ditch us.\\
162 - Are you sure? 'Cause as he
drove past, he was doing this.\\
163 - No. Donna, he's kidding.
He wouldn't ditch us.\\
164 - He ditched us!\\
165 - I'm sure he's right outside.
I'll go get him.\\
166 - - Fez, I don't know.
- Don't worry.\\
167 - I'll go and get the money and
come back. You can trust me.\\
168 - - He's not coming back!
- And we trusted him.\\
169 - Foreigners lie!\\
170 - You know what?\\
171 - I'm just gonna call my dad,
and he'll come pay for our dinner.\\
172 - Okay, but, Jackie,
if you don't come back...\\
173 - Eric, please. I'm not
immature like those idiots.\\
174 - She is immature
like those idiots!\\
175 - I can't believe I got stuck
here with the squares.\\
176 - We're not squares!\\
177 - Donna, settle down. You don't
want to upset your stomach.\\
178 - This is bad, man.\\
179 - If I'm not fighting against
the system, I am the system.\\
180 - Screw it. I'm going.\\
181 - Banzai!\\
182 - Okay, I can take the check now.\\
183 - Or whenever or now.\\
184 - Um...\\
185 - Two more bananas Foster, please.\\
186 - Eric, what are you doing?\\
187 - I'm stalling.
They'll come back.\\
188 - Joke's over, you know?\\
189 - Best thing about this joke,
it just keeps going and going.\\
190 - And not only did
we break the law,\\
191 - we screwed our friends
while breaking the law.\\
192 - How dumb was he
to give me the car keys?\\
193 - I mean, who here trusts me?\\
194 - - No way.
- Not me.\\
195 - Thank you.\\
196 - You know what?\\
197 - Stolen food does taste better.\\
198 - Dinner roll?\\
199 - Guys, I feel bad
about Eric and Donna.\\
200 - Maybe we should figure
out a way to help them.\\
201 - Sure, we could do that. Or...\\
202 - ...we could ask ourselves,
"How can we make this worse?"\\
203 - Happy anniversary,
happy anniversary\\
204 - Happy anniversary,
Donna and Eric\\
205 - With best wishes from
Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie.\\
206 - Oh, this is just terrible.\\
207 - No, Kitty.\\
208 - Quincy's no Columbo,
but he's still pretty good.\\
209 - Red, Bob was very upset
when he left here.\\
210 - Bob's always upset. He's
a little girl in big-boy pants.\\
211 - Well, why didn't
you offer him a job?\\
212 - I didn't want to insult him by
offering him some nothing job.\\
213 - Oh, Red,
you insult him every day.\\
214 - But that's different.
He thinks I'm kidding.\\
215 - Kitty, this is about
a man's dignity.\\
216 - Oh, sure,
it was awful, what happened.\\
217 - But let's just put it behind
us and watch Quincy.\\
218 - Hey!\\
219 - Oh, come on, Red. How bad
would it be working with Bob?\\
220 - It's a big store.
You'd hardly ever see him.\\
221 - Maybe you could...
You could hide from him.\\
222 - He'd find me.\\
223 - He always finds me.\\
224 - Well, you better
think of something\\
225 - because they are gonna live
next door to us for a long, long time.\\
226 - You don't know that.\\
227 - He's out of work.
He'll probably lose the house.\\
228 - Fine. I'll talk to Bob.\\
229 - But you gotta work
on your sense of humor, lady.\\
230 - Man, I can't believe those
guys screwed us like this.\\
231 - Well, at least we
still have each other.\\
232 - You know what?
You're right, Donna.\\
233 - I can't count on much in this crazy
world, but I can always count on you.\\
234 - That is so true.\\
235 - - I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.\\
236 - Hey!\\
237 - Why don't you
just sit your lying ass down?\\
238 - Eric, don't you trust me?\\
239 - Not as far as I can throw you,
and that ain't far.\\
240 - How can you say that?\\
241 - Okay, so I noticed the fire
exit was next to the bathroom.\\
242 - It doesn't mean I'd use it.\\
243 - I just happened to notice it,
that's all. It's very convenient.\\
244 - Donna, don't you
see what's happening?\\
245 - - They've turned us
against each other.
- You're right.\\
246 - I was gonna use the fire exit.
I was!\\
247 - You know why they do this?\\
248 - Because they know
we won't get them back.\\
249 - We're responsible,
mature "Mom and Dad."\\
250 - We just... We won't
stoop to their level.\\
251 - Well, damn it, let's stoop to
their level or an even lower level.\\
252 - Yeah. Oh, I'm with you,
baby, yeah.\\
253 - There's just one problem.\\
254 - We can't do it from in here.\\
255 - If I don't make it...\\
256 - ...tell Mama I'm sorry.\\
257 - Don't talk like that.\\
258 - You'll tell her yourself.\\
259 - Hey, Bob.\\
260 - So, taking out your trash, huh?\\
261 - No, Red,
I'm bringing it back in.\\
262 - Yeah, Bob. That's a good one.\\
263 - Listen, I want to offer you
a job at Price Mart.\\
264 - - Jeez, Red, Price Mart?
- What?\\
265 - Yeah, I mean,
that may be fine for you,\\
266 - but you're talking to a guy
who owned his own business.\\
267 - And ran it into the ground.\\
268 - Okay... Okay, I'm...
I'm sorry.\\
269 - - Just take the job, Bob.
- No.\\
270 - Okay, that's fine, Bob.
There is no job. Forget it.\\
271 - Oh, so now you're
not offering me a job.\\
272 - I just offered you the job, and
you said you didn't want the job!\\
273 - Well, ask me again.\\
274 - Oh, cripes.\\
275 - You want a job at
Price Mart, Bob?\\
276 - I'll think about it.\\
277 - Go to hell, Bob!\\
278 - Okay, you guys, okay.
Good one last night.\\
279 - You know, ditching us at
the restaurant and everything.\\
280 - Yeah, we got you so bad.\\
281 - You really did.
We laughed and laughed.\\
282 - To show you guys
we're such good sports,\\
283 - we made you a batch
of special brownies.\\
284 - Special brownies. Like
the special kind of special?\\
285 - The best kind of special.\\
286 - Something's wrong,
I don't feel special.\\
287 - Me neither.\\
288 - Yeah, I don't think those were
special brownies, man.\\
289 - Oh, no, no. They're special.\\
290 - Say, Donna, do you have any more
of that special ingredient we used?\\
291 - Well, I certainly do, Eric.\\
292 - Chocolate super-lax.\\
293 - - You didn't.
- We did.\\
294 - We so did. Now, maybe you'll
think twice before screwing us.\\
295 - Well, nice try, because
I don't feel any... Oh!\\
296 - Oh, no. I am last.\\
297 - - Hi, no!
- I know.\\
298 - You're surprised to see
me, right? And upset?\\
299 - - Yes, many things are upset.
- Okay, listen.\\
300 - Okay, listen, Fez.
About last night...\\
301 - - I know you were angry...
- Yeah.\\
302 - - ...and you have
every right to be.
- No.\\
303 - But you know what this was?
Our first fight.\\
304 - And it made us a real couple,
if you can forgive me.\\
305 - - Fine. Move away from the door.
- So we're okay?\\
306 - - Good.
- No.\\
307 - Now let's make up
like a real couple.\\
308 - You bastards!\\
309 - Wait, Fez! Wait up!\\
310 - Okay, you guys.\\
311 - That was a wicked burn.\\
312 - I mean, it had all the elements.\\
313 - You didn't see it coming,
parts of it really hurt.\\
314 - - Well, Kelso,
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Oh, I did.\\
315 - I got my eye on you two.\\
316 - You're not gonna
burn me like that again.\\
317 - - I love our friends.
- Me, too.\\
318 - Hey, Red.\\
319 - I've been thinking about your
offer, and I want you to know\\
320 - I made a decision.\\
321 - Oh, goody.\\
322 - But I need you to ask me again.\\
323 - Bob, would you, uh,\\
324 - like a job at Price Mart?\\
325 - Say it like you mean it.\\
326 - Go to hell, Bob!

4 - Keep it.\\
5 - Hey, that's my soda.\\
6 - Life is unfair.\\
7 - Oh, swell.\\

55 - No way!\\
56 - WFPP?\\
57 - That's Jerry Thunder!\\
58 - The sound.\\
59 - Totally,
and he knows rock stars,\\
60 - and he gets
free concert tickets,\\
61 - and he gave me this
guitar pick from Foghat.\\
62 - No way!\\
63 - Eric, there's a whole
pile of bumper stickers,\\
64 - and they're free!\\
65 - No way!\\
66 - Okay, well, I gotta go.\\
67 - I gotta go alphabetize
the 8-tracks.\\
68 - No way!\\
69 - Hangin' out\\
70 - Down the street\\
71 - The same old thing\\
72 - We did last week\\
73 - Not a thing to do\\
74 - But talk to you\\
75 - We're all all right\\
76 - We're all all right\\
77 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
78 - Leo, man, this place is a mess.\\
79 - Yeah? You should see
my garage.\\
80 - This is your garage, man.\\
81 - Well, then you see what I mean.\\
82 - It's a mess.\\
83 - National Geographic
is a beautiful magazine.\\
84 - There is volcanoes,
and a gazelle...\\
85 - And naked...\\
86 - Hey, Leo, man,
there's a car in here.\\
87 - It's an El Camino.\\
88 - Oh!\\
89 - Wow.
Do you think it's mine?\\
90 - The plate says "Leo's."\\
91 - No, I mean the car, man.\\
92 - This guy, you know?\\
93 - And this is where
we do the interviews.\\
94 - A lot of rock legends
have puked in this room.\\
95 - Good times.\\
96 - Wow.\\
97 - So if I stay here long enough,\\
98 - I might see
a rock star throw up?\\
99 - See it?\\
100 - You'll probably clean it up.\\
101 - All right!\\
102 - Oh, yeah.
This is Jerry Thunder...\\
103 - Coming to you on the sound,\\
104 - and it looks like we got
a new office girl.\\
105 - What's your name, baby?\\
106 - Um, Donna.\\
107 - Mmm, well, Donna,\\
108 - you are hot.\\
109 - So I'm gonna call
you "hot Donna."\\
110 - Okay.\\
111 - You got yourself
a boyfriend, hot Donna?\\
112 - Um, no.\\
113 - Mmm, that is good news, fellas,\\
114 - 'cause hot Donna is hot!\\
115 - Um...\\
116 - Max, why'd you make me say that\\
117 - just 'cause I have a boyfriend.\\
118 - Fine.
You have a boyfriend.\\
119 - So does Elton John.\\
120 - No way!\\
121 - Yeah, they're
a fantastic couple.\\
122 - I love 'em.\\
123 - The point is we're
selling an image here,\\
124 - and an available hot Donna
is good for ratings.\\
125 - Oh, well, what the hell?\\
126 - Eric won't
have a problem with this.\\
127 - What the hell? I have
a problem with this!\\
128 - Maybe she dumped you
and forgot to tell you.\\
129 - Oh, my God.
Thank you, Nairobi.\\
130 - Look, Forman, I wouldn't
read too much into this.\\
131 - Donna probably just said she doesn't have
a boyfriend because she's ashamed of you.\\
132 - Okay, baby, I'll see you later.\\
133 - Listen, Forman,\\
134 - you're just upset because
you know Donna's entering\\
135 - the really cool world
of FM radio.\\
136 - But, you know, feel good, man.\\
137 - 'Cause you'll be like
that first sweet relationship\\
138 - she'll Look back on fondly
while she's on the tour bus\\
139 - straddling rock stars.\\
140 - Yeah, life just hasn't been
the same since I lost the van.\\
141 - You know,
it's hard to get chicks\\
142 - when you don't have wheels.\\
143 - I mean, you know, sometimes
a killer bod just isn't enough.\\
144 - Amen to that, brother.\\
145 - Okay, I'll sell the
El Camino to you for...\\
146 - $500.\\
147 - $400.\\
148 - $600.
$700.\\
149 - No, damn! Wait!\\
150 - That's the wrong way.\\
151 - Um...\\
152 - Uh...$500!\\
153 - No.\\
154 - $500.\\
155 - Sold.\\
156 - Sucker.
Sucker.\\
157 - Eric, don't worry about
this whole Donna thing.\\
158 - I know a lot of girls who are
much more realistic for you.\\
159 - You know, they
might be a little heavy\\
160 - or a little dumb
or have a cockeye, but...\\
161 - Jackie, she didn't
break up with me, okay?\\
162 - She still loves me.\\
163 - Oh.\\
164 - So you're in the denial stage.\\
165 - No.\\
166 - See?\\
167 - Oh, my God, you guys.\\
168 - This has been the best day ever!\\
169 - Jerry Thunder is totally
taking me under his wing,\\
170 - and his stories?\\
171 - He's so funny.\\
172 - Oh! Elton John
has a boyfriend.\\
173 - Plus I get to meet Alice Cooper.\\
174 - Here it is!\\
175 - I'm gonna see
if Alice will sign this.\\
176 - Oh, I can't make it to
the movie tonight. See ya.\\
177 - See?\\
178 - She still loves me.\\
179 - Yeah.\\
180 - Have you met
my friend, fat Sally?\\
181 - Earl, what brings you here?\\
182 - Well, I took the bus.\\
183 - First off, Kitty, I'd like to
say you have a lovely home.\\
184 - Second of all, screw you, Red!\\
185 - What?\\
186 - Well, I'm outta work,
and it's all your fault.\\
187 - How am I supposed
to pay my bills\\
188 - or feed my dog or go to Hawaii?\\
189 - Look, Earl,\\
190 - you can't blame me
for getting fired.\\
191 - I didn't make you
too dumb to flip burgers.\\
192 - That's God's fault.\\
193 - Yeah? Well, you know
the Christmas card you get\\
194 - of me and my dog every year?\\
195 - You're off the list.
Yeah, that's right.\\
196 - Don't bother checking
the mailbox, Red,\\
197 - 'cause it ain't coming.\\
198 - I loved his Christmas cards.\\
199 - They were handmade.\\
200 - This is Jerry Thunder...\\
201 - Coming at you on the sound,\\
202 - and we got Alice Cooper
droppin' by any minute,\\
203 - and it is going to be wild!\\
204 - This is Jerry Thunder...\\
205 - Coming your way on the sound\\
206 - where we are enjoying
lots of sex, drugs,\\
207 - and rock and roll.\\
208 - Am I right, hot Donna?\\
209 - You sure are, Jerry Thunder.\\
210 - Radio people are the coolest!\\
211 - That's right.\\
212 - That's why you want
to have sex with us all.\\
213 - I really do!\\
214 - Hey, everybody,
it's Alice Cooper.\\
215 - Hey, hot Donna.\\
216 - Heard about you at the
last big rock star meeting.\\
217 - Hey, Ted Nugent and
I were wondering,\\
218 - did you ever break up with
that loser boyfriend of yours?\\
219 - Not yet, Alice Cooper.\\
220 - Here's my loser
boyfriend right now.\\
221 - Hey, Donna, are you ready
to go to the Pricemart Ball?\\
222 - You hear that, everybody?
The Pricemart Ball.\\
223 - Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't we feed\\
224 - your skinny boyfriend
to the snake?\\
225 - Okay.\\
226 - Damn you, Alice Cooper!\\
227 - I haven't seen
Donna in two days.\\
228 - She's been spending all of
her time at the radio station.\\
229 - It's a real problem.\\
230 - Oh, well, here we go again.\\
231 - Forman's got a problem.\\
232 - Well, you know what?\\
233 - Maybe I got a problem, man.
Did you ever think of that?\\
234 - Oh, man, Hyde, I'm sorry.\\
235 - Go ahead, man. Unload.\\
236 - Actually, I'm cool.\\
237 - And that's how you do it.\\
238 - You have a problem
and you hold it in, man.\\
239 - Now leather up, fruitcake.\\
240 - I have a problem...\\
241 - But I guess I'll
keep it all inside.\\
242 - Hey, you guys,\\
243 - so Leo agreed to sell me
the El Camino for, like, $500,\\
244 - so what I need from you is...\\
245 - $500.\\
246 - Hey, I'm Hyde.\\
247 - I don't feel anything.\\
248 - I'm just a frizzy-haired robot.\\
249 - Hey, I'm Forman.\\
250 - I use the same voice
to imitate everybody.\\
251 - It's just that I...\\
252 - I...\\
253 - Nothing.\\
254 - Oh, Gilligan screwed it up.\\
255 - He always screws it up.\\
256 - Why don't they just kill him?\\
257 - I don't think you're really
mad at Gilligan, Red.\\
258 - Admit it. You feel guilty
about what happened to Earl.\\
259 - This has
nothing to do with Earl.\\
260 - The professor worked on that
coconut radio for three months.\\
261 - Now how the hell are they
gonna get off that island?\\
262 - Well, then I guess I was wrong.\\
263 - I don't know why
I questioned you.\\
264 - And I'll tell you...\\
265 - Something's going on
with that Skipper.\\
266 - You don't get that fat
eating coconuts.\\
267 - Jackie, you know
I wouldn't ask you\\
268 - if this wasn't important, okay?\\
269 - But this is an El Camino.\\
270 - That's Spanish
for "The Camino."\\
271 - By accepting this check,\\
272 - you are agreeing to two things.\\
273 - First, you will
pay me back in full,\\
274 - and you will be
my slave for a week.\\
275 - You mean like your love slave?\\
276 - No.\\
277 - More like an errand boy.\\
278 - You mean like
your errand love boy?\\
279 - No.\\
280 - Just errands.\\
281 - Okay.\\
282 - Good. Here.
Now, go get your car,\\
283 - and then come by my place.\\
284 - I need you to hold my
toes apart while I paint them.\\
285 - Well, errand boy,\\
286 - you just sold your
soul for a car.\\
287 - Who cares, Fez?\\
288 - Your soul is like an appendix.\\
289 - I don't even use it.\\
290 - Kitty, about this burger...\\
291 - What? Is it burnt?\\
292 - Are you gonna fire me?\\
293 - Make me live on the street
with the other hoboes?\\
294 - Kitty, let it go.\\
295 - I do not feel guilty!\\
296 - All right! I feel guilty!\\
297 - He'll thank me when
his tummy stops hurting.\\
298 - So...\\
299 - How are things with you and...\\
300 - Hot Donna?\\
301 - Well, if you heard
about hot Donna,\\
302 - then you heard that
I'm not her boyfriend.\\
303 - The whole world heard that.\\
304 - Well...\\
305 - People in Canada heard it.\\
306 - Oh, honey,
Canadians don't matter.\\
307 - What matters is that you
and Donna are okay, right?\\
308 - Mom, I don't even know
if we're okay.\\
309 - She's spending all of
her time at the sound\\
310 - with Jerry Thunder.\\
311 - That reminds me of when I
first started at the hospital.\\
312 - Your father was concerned\\
313 - that I was spending
way too much time down there\\
314 - with all these handsome doctors.\\
315 - But, mom, that's stupid.\\
316 - Doctors aren't
important like DJs.\\
317 - Okay, well, the point is,\\
318 - your dad started showing up at
the hospital to mark his territory,\\
319 - and one of the doctors
who was getting a little fresh\\
320 - got punched in the mouth.\\
321 - Dad's so cool.\\
322 - No, that wasn't cool.
It was embarrassing.\\
323 - But you married him.\\
324 - Yes, but it was embarrassing.\\
325 - But, still, you married him.\\
326 - The point is,
you have to trust Donna.\\
327 - But dad didn't trust you,
and you married him.\\
328 - Okay, you know what?\\
329 - I can't talk to you.\\
330 - Okay, I am here
to withdraw my complaint\\
331 - about my overcooked burger.\\
332 - Ah-ha. Well, I don't think
you can do that.\\
333 - Well, I think I can.\\
334 - Of course you can. The
customer's always right.\\
335 - So you'll give Earl
his job back?\\
336 - Well, the fry cook burned
off his finger this morning,\\
337 - so... sure.\\
338 - By the way, don't have
the fish sticks.\\
339 - We haven't found it.\\
340 - You hear that, Earl?\\
341 - You got your job back.
You can go to work.\\
342 - Wait. You mean right now?\\
343 - But I'll Miss WKRP.\\
344 - Okay, man, here are the keys.\\
345 - Oh, bitchin'!\\
346 - You know, I was gonna
give this car to my son\\
347 - on his 16th birthday,\\
348 - but then my old lady
took him and split.\\
349 - Yeah, wow. Sad story.
Keys, please?\\
350 - I can't sell you the car, man.\\
351 - Oh, man!\\
352 - Oh, I guess I understand.\\
353 - Thanks, man.\\
354 - Hyde, I want you
to have this car.\\
355 - What? No!\\
356 - You just said that you
couldn't sell the car!\\
357 - Well, I'm not selling it.\\
358 - I'm giving it to him, man.\\
359 - He's family.\\
360 - He's the son I never had.\\
361 - You just said you had a son!\\
362 - Yeah,\\
363 - and Hyde's the son I never had.\\
364 - Hey, Leo, man, thanks.
You're the best...\\
365 - The car...
The love...\\
366 - The wicked burn on Kelso.\\
367 - Hey, man. Need a lift?\\
368 - Eric, what are you doing here?\\
369 - I'll tell you what I'm
doing here, Donna.\\
370 - I'm here to say who's
who and what's what\\
371 - to Jerry Thunder.\\
372 - Eric, you can't talk to
Jerry. He's on the air.\\
373 - Oh, fine. Then I guess
I'll just have to wait.\\
374 - But let me tell you something...\\
375 - I'll be fuming.\\
376 - This is Jerry Thunder...\\
377 - Signing off,\\
378 - and I'll see you
around the sound.\\
379 - All right. Whoo!\\
380 - Let's get Mr. Big FM stud
out here right now.\\
381 - Yeah! Big time!\\
382 - Eric. Why are you
being weird?\\
383 - Donna, I'm gonna make
a long story short.\\
384 - I'm here to kick a little
DJ ass, so have a seat.\\
385 - Hey, Donna, and this
must be the boyfriend Eric.\\
386 - Hi. I'm Jerry Thunder.\\
387 - You're Jerry Thunder?\\
388 - Well, that's just great.\\
389 - Check out Jerry Thunder.\\
390 - Hey, you kids,
the night is young.\\
391 - You guys up for a game
of Dungeons & Dragons?\\
392 - I'll let you be Mandar,
the half-elf.\\
393 - Oh, well. Another time,
perhaps. Good night.\\
394 - So that's Jerry Thunder?\\
395 - You know, it really turns me off\\
396 - when you're so insecure
like this.\\
397 - We've been together long enough\\
398 - where it's either
you don't get it\\
399 - or you don't trust me.\\
400 - No, Donna, I trust you.\\
401 - Well, then you don't get it.\\
402 - I finally have something
that's really good\\
403 - in my life right now.\\
404 - And if you can't handle that,\\
405 - then we have a problem.\\
406 - So, Eric, do we have a problem?\\
407 - No, we do not have a problem.\\
408 - Okay, good,\\
409 - 'Cause I broke my nail
on a Styx album.\\
410 - I didn't even
get to meet Alice Cooper,\\
411 - and I am super pissed.\\
412 - Yeah, well, you know...\\
413 - You have a really cool job.\\
414 - Yeah, I do, don't I?\\
415 - REO Speedwagon's
coming in next week.\\
416 - I'm gonna see if
they'll sign my boobs.\\
417 - Now we have a problem.\\
418 - Okay, suddenly
you're face-to-face\\
419 - with the dragon of fear.\\
420 - No! I should have worn
my gauntlet of ogre strength.\\
421 - Dumb!\\
422 - Any ideas, Mandar?\\
423 - Well, there's
my rod of cancellation,\\
424 - but it's chancy.\\
425 - Yeah. You know, a girl
once promised to play with us,\\
426 - but she didn't show up.\\
427 - Cheer up, King Zintar the great.\\
428 - Let's get out there
and slay that dragon.
\subsection {Episode 15: Donna's Panties}
1 - Oh!
Oh!\\
2 - That's 16 for me and Hyde,\\
3 - and four for the losers.\\
4 - You guys ought to get a mascot.\\
5 - A big, green, furry loser.\\
6 - That's... that's not
even a thing.\\
7 - Come on. Take it to the
hoop, or maybe you're afraid,\\
8 - 'cause you know
I'm gonna slap it down.\\
9 - Oh, yeah? Well...\\
10 - Yeah?\\
11 - You tell her, Eric.\\
12 - Ooh!\\
13 - Oh! How can he stand
the embarrassment?\\
14 - She told you
what she was gonna do.\\
15 - You gotta listen, man.\\
16 - Eric, why don't you just
give me the two points?\\
17 - Save yourself the humiliation?\\
18 - Well, why don't you just
save yourself the two points,\\
19 - and then,
the humiliation will be...\\
20 - Whatever! Come on!\\
21 - Oh, I'm comin',\\
22 - and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.\\
23 - Eric!\\
24 - Oh, my God! Donna's
wearing granny panties!\\
25 - Nice panties, granny.\\
26 - Oh, come on.
You have to admit\\
27 - that was some killer D.\\
28 - Oh, no.\\
29 - Hangin' out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - We're all all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - Okay, Fez, I got you some
Valentine conversation hearts.\\
39 - Oh. Well, thank you,
Caroline.\\
40 - "Be mine."\\
41 - Okay.\\
42 - "Sweetheart."
It really is.\\
43 - "Kiss me."\\
44 - Well, I'm not about
to argue with candy.\\
45 - Fez...\\
46 - Is there one in there
that says "get a room?"\\
47 - No, but here's one that says,\\
48 - "Kiss
my brown ass."\\
49 - Sorry you had
to hear that, Caroline.\\
50 - It's okay.
She asked for it.\\
51 - Oh! I gotta get going.\\
52 - I'll see you tonight.\\
53 - Yeah.\\
54 - Well, well, well...\\
55 - Look who has a lady.\\
56 - And to think, I was
about to settle for you.\\
57 - Talk about dodging a bullet.\\
58 - Hey. Hey. Check out
this article in Boy's Life.\\
59 - "The square knot,
not just for squares?"\\
60 - No. This one about
being an astronaut.\\
61 - I think I'm gonna do that.\\
62 - Michael, I think there's a
prerequisite for being an astronaut.\\
63 - You have to be not dumb.\\
64 - Uh-uh.\\
65 - If they can send a monkey
into space, they can send me.\\
66 - I don't know.
Monkeys are pretty smart.\\
67 - All right, fine.
Fine. Make fun.\\
68 - When you see my
shoe-prints on the moon,\\
69 - what are you gonna say then?\\
70 - Probably, "Hey, some monkey's
wearing Kelso's shoes."\\
71 - Hey-hey, astro-chimp...\\
72 - When you come back
down to earth,\\
73 - if your parachute doesn't work,\\
74 - you could always use
Donna's monstrous panties.\\
75 - Hey. Hey.
Hey, you guys.\\
76 - None of that when
Donna gets here, okay?\\
77 - I don't need her mad at
me on Valentine's Day.\\
78 - All right, Forman, relax.
Wearing granny panties\\
79 - is a very sensitive issue that I
don't find funny and I refuse to exploit.\\
80 - Good.\\
81 - Hey, everybody, look.
It's granny panties.\\
82 - Hyde.\\
83 - Uh, sorry, man.
It's in my nature to burn.\\
84 - Granny panties understands.
Don't you, granny panties?\\
85 - Okay, look. I didn't have
anything else to wear.\\
86 - It was laundry day.\\
87 - I didn't know they made
a washing machine\\
88 - big enough for those panties.\\
89 - Hey!\\
90 - Hey! You guys can all
just shut up, okay?\\
91 - So she wears big panties.
So what?\\
92 - Donna, look.
I am really...\\
93 - Really, really sorry.\\
94 - Eric, I'm fine. Let's
just forget about it.\\
95 - Really? 'Cause when I saw
your sweats around your ankles,\\
96 - I thought I was dead.\\
97 - Eric, I said I'm fine.\\
98 - Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. You are so cool.\\
99 - You... I... you are seriously,
like, the coolest girl ever.\\
100 - Wow. Chicks must
really dig astronauts,\\
101 - 'cause it says here
that astronauts\\
102 - get all the Tang they want.\\
103 - Oh, Donna is gonna love
you making dinner for her.\\
104 - There is nothing sexier
than a man who cooks...\\
105 - Unless that man
is Burt Reynolds.\\
106 - Then I don't give a darn
what he's doing,\\
107 - he's just sexy.\\
108 - Ooh. Mom has a thing
for the bandit.\\
109 - 10-4.\\
110 - Go set the table.\\
111 - Oh. No, no, honey.
Use the special china.\\
112 - You don't want to mess up a
good thing with everyday dishes.\\
113 - Okay, but...\\
114 - Mom, it's not like
I can mess this up.\\
115 - I mean, Donna is cool
no matter what I do.\\
116 - Like, earlier?
I pulled down her pants\\
117 - in front of everyone
in the driveway,\\
118 - and she just...
You did what?\\
119 - No. It was cool. She
just... she said she was fine.\\
120 - Oh. Then I guess
she's fine.\\
121 - Yeah, 'cause she said
she was fine.\\
122 - Yeah. She wouldn't say she
was fine unless she was fine.\\
123 - Would she?\\
124 - What are you talking about?\\
125 - Well, what do you think
I'm talking about?\\
126 - I don't know.\\
127 - Why are you doing this to me?\\
128 - Doing what?
I don't know!\\
129 - Well, all I meant was, have
a happy Valentine's Day.\\
130 - Oh.\\
131 - Oh. Okay. Thanks.\\
132 - Although I doubt you will.\\
133 - Stop it!\\
134 - Hello, Michael.\\
135 - Hi, Mrs. Forman.
Is Laurie home?\\
136 - I got a little surprise for her.\\
137 - Oh, you brought her flowers.\\
138 - Isn't that just...\\
139 - A waste of money?\\
140 - No. She deserves them.\\
141 - I mean...\\
142 - Not many people
get me, you know?\\
143 - I'm a complicated
guy. So...\\
144 - When everyone starts in on me,\\
145 - I just like to be
with my girlfriend,\\
146 - 'cause she's nice to me.\\
147 - Who are we talking about?\\
148 - Laurie.\\
149 - Laurie Forman?\\
150 - Yeah. So, I just
want to tell her\\
151 - that I'm happy we're together\\
152 - on this, our nation's
day of love.\\
153 - Oh. Well, how patriotic of
you, Michael.\\
154 - Yeah. I want
to be an astronaut.\\
155 - Oh. Well, I...\\
156 - I think you'd make
a fine spaceman.\\
157 - Thanks.\\
158 - You know, I gotta say,\\
159 - I think Laurie gets a lot
of her sweetness from you.\\
160 - Laurie Forman?\\
161 - Bye, Laurie.\\
162 - Hey, man. What the
hell are you doin'?\\
163 - Oh, yeah.
I should, uh,\\
164 - probably go out
through the window.\\
165 - Oh, would you look at this?\\
166 - Ooh. A nice, romantic
dinner for two.\\
167 - Donna's gonna love it.\\
168 - Why? Is she bringing
a date?\\
169 - Red.\\
170 - I'm sorry, but that's funny.\\
171 - Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Foreman.\\
172 - Oh, my. Look at this
vision of lovely.\\
173 - Oh, this is just like when
you two were little and you,\\
174 - you used to eat
pretend supper. Hmm.\\
175 - Only now, it won't end up with
Donna sitting on Eric's head.\\
176 - Oh. Oh, Red,
let's go.\\
177 - Kitty, that was just awful.\\
178 - I know. Keep walking.\\
179 - Wow. I was...\\
180 - Afraid that was
gonna be awkward.\\
181 - Yeah. Eric,
this looks so great.\\
182 - Yep. Shaked, baked, and
maked especially for you...\\
183 - And this here is a little
somethin' that I like to call...\\
184 - A little somethin'.\\
185 - You bought me a present?
That's so sweet.\\
186 - I didn't even get you
anything, and you got me...\\
187 - Panties? What the hell?\\
188 - Yeah. Panties.\\
189 - Get it?\\
190 - No.\\
191 - To replace your ugly ones.\\
192 - Eric, when I said
I didn't get it,\\
193 - I meant, I didn't like it.\\
194 - No. See, you forgave
me earlier, and...\\
195 - I figured if I brought it up,\\
196 - we could just,
you know, share a laugh.\\
197 - Your turn.\\
198 - You know what? You're
the one who doesn't get it.\\
199 - Well, maybe you should
explain it to me.\\
200 - I heard that!\\
201 - Man, this is the worst
Valentine's Day ever.\\
202 - It's Donna's fault.
Okay?\\
203 - I didn't make her wear
that big, goofy underwear.\\
204 - I mean, I'm sorry,\\
205 - but if you're hanging
out with this crowd,\\
206 - you got to know that eventually\\
207 - your pants are
getting pulled down.\\
208 - Am I right?\\
209 - I am so glad I did not
pull down Caroline's pants.\\
210 - I'm mean, if she
asked me to, I would.\\
211 - 'Cause I respect her wishes.\\
212 - And also, I am so horny.\\
213 - Forman, when I told
you it would be funny\\
214 - to give Donna panties,\\
215 - I meant it would be funny to me,\\
216 - and it was.\\
217 - This is what happened
to my heart\\
218 - when I found out Laurie
was cheating on me.\\
219 - It's lemon.\\
220 - I mean, how could she do this?\\
221 - Uh, I really thought
we had something.\\
222 - Probably the same
way you did it to Jackie.\\
223 - Only this time it's even
funnier, 'cause it's you.\\
224 - It's a good day.\\
225 - Tonight, I am going to ask
Caroline to go steady with me.\\
226 - Because that is the last step\\
227 - before you can do it, right?\\
228 - Oh, how I want to do it.\\
229 - I am so horny.\\
230 - So Michael cheated
on me with Laurie,\\
231 - and Laurie cheated on him.\\
232 - Hmm! There is a God,
and he's on my side.\\
233 - Well, I'm glad you're happy.\\
234 - My boyfriend's a giant baby.\\
235 - Ooh, underwear is so funny.\\
236 - Pooh-pooh.
Pee-pee. Caca.\\
237 - You know what will
make you feel better?\\
238 - Let's go make mean jokes
at Michael's expense.\\
239 - How will that
make me feel better?\\
240 - 'Cause then I'll feel better,
and I could cheer you up.\\
241 - On what planet did Eric think\\
242 - it was okay to pull
down my pants?\\
243 - There are some things
that are private, Jackie.\\
244 - For instance, everything
under my pants.\\
245 - I agree. Keep it
to yourself.\\
246 - Why doesn't Eric understand
that when I said I'm fine,\\
247 - I meant I will be fine...\\
248 - So long as he kisses
my ass for two weeks\\
249 - until I'm actually fine.\\
250 - He's like brain damaged.\\
251 - Look...\\
252 - He's just not a good boyfriend.\\
253 - You should dump him, and
then we can move to Dallas\\
254 - and be weathergirls.\\
255 - So, how was you night?\\
256 - He blew it.\\
257 - Well, what a surprise.\\
258 - Wait, you're saying that
like it's not a surprise.\\
259 - Okay, then.\\
260 - You know, son...\\
261 - There's a time and a place\\
262 - to pull down a lady's pants.\\
263 - And a pickup game in our
driveway is not one of 'em.\\
264 - Look, Dad, I know it was dumb.\\
265 - But Donna said it was fine,\\
266 - and... apparently
it wasn't fine.\\
267 - Sit down.\\
268 - Eric,\\
269 - there's a pair of shoes
up in your mom's closet.\\
270 - And one day, I accidentally
stepped on one of them and scuffed it.\\
271 - "Don't worry." your mom said.
"Everything's fine."\\
272 - But every now and then, she
takes them out of the closet\\
273 - and she puts them on
and she does this...\\
274 - Oh...\\
275 - And then takes them off and
puts them back in her closet.\\
276 - Eric, this has been
going on for 14 years.\\
277 - So why doesn't she
just get new shoes?\\
278 - Oh, Eric.
You are so young.\\
279 - You see, women are...\\
280 - What's the word I'm looking
for here... crazy.\\
281 - Oh, so, overall
you and Mom are okay,\\
282 - so Donna and me,
we'll be okay? Right?\\
283 - No.\\
284 - I scuffed you mom's shoe.\\
285 - I didn't pull her pants down\\
286 - in front of God
and the foreign kid.\\
287 - So, what are you saying?\\
288 - I'm screwed with Donna?\\
289 - Hey, if it makes you
feel any better,\\
290 - I'm surprised
you lasted this long.\\
291 - I feel like I'm
clinging to a cloud\\
292 - I like popcorn.
Do you like popcorn?\\
293 - Yes.\\
294 - I like candy.
Do you like candy?\\
295 - Yes.\\
296 - I like soda. Would you
like to go steady with me?\\
297 - Oh! Yes, Fez!\\
298 - I think I might
have tricked you.\\
299 - You do know we are
going steady, right?\\
300 - Yes.\\
301 - What a magical night.\\
302 - Yes.\\
303 - I dreamed of this
since the moment we met.\\
304 - Me, too.\\
305 - You know, this is my
favorite movie of all time.\\
306 - I've seen it, like, 16 times.\\
307 - That woman keeps calling
Clint Eastwood\\
308 - and asking him
to play Misty for her.\\
309 - Isn't it romantic?\\
310 - Romantic? But
she is following him\\
311 - and bothering him
and threatening him.\\
312 - Huh? Yeah.
That's what I mean.\\
313 - If she can't have
him, nobody can.\\
314 - Well, okay, then.\\
315 - You're so cute. I love
being your girlfriend.\\
316 - If you ever left me,
I'd kill you.\\
317 - Oh...
Okay, then.\\
318 - And what's up
with Eric's head anyway?\\
319 - It's completely out of
proportion to that skinny body.\\
320 - He looks like a blow-pop.\\
321 - You know, I bet Michael's\\
322 - going to want me
to feel sorry for him.\\
323 - But I'm going to be
all, like, aw.\\
324 - Bite it, Casanova!\\
325 - Hey, Jackie. Donna.\\
326 - Hey, Michael. I
heard what happened.\\
327 - Yeah. Me and Laurie are done.\\
328 - Doesn't Eric look
like a blow-pop?\\
329 - Uh, yeah.
I guess.\\
330 - Uh, listen. Uh, Jackie.
Can we go somewhere and talk?\\
331 - No! Look, anything
you have to say to me,\\
332 - you can say in front of Donna.\\
333 - Well, okay, uh...\\
334 - Listen. What happened with
me and Laurie got me thinking,\\
335 - and what she did
was really a betrayal,\\
336 - and it hurt so much.\\
337 - So you want me to
feel sorry for you?\\
338 - No! Don't feel
sorry for me.\\
339 - Wait, what?\\
340 - No. I deserved this.\\
341 - After what I did to you...\\
342 - I don't know if you've
made the connection,\\
343 - but there are a lot
of similarities\\
344 - between what Laurie did to me
and what I did to you.\\
345 - Except you and
I were really in love,\\
346 - and you trusted me.\\
347 - Jackie, I let you down,
and I'm sorry.\\
348 - Wait, wait, wait. Are
you just saying this stuff\\
349 - so I'll give you Valentine sex?\\
350 - 'Cause this is
a holy day, Michael,\\
351 - and you should be
ashamed of yourself.\\
352 - No.\\
353 - I just said
what I wanted to say,\\
354 - and I don't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.\\
355 - So good-bye.\\
356 - Jackie, are you okay?\\
357 - Sure. Great.\\
358 - I'm just... Sitting here
alone on Valentine's Day.\\
359 - Hey, I'm here.\\
360 - Yeah, why are you here?\\
361 - You should be with
the one you love,\\
362 - and you love Eric
for some reason.\\
363 - Shut up. There's
a lot of reasons.\\
364 - He's not a blow-pop.\\
365 - He's a sweetie pie.\\
366 - Then you should be with him.\\
367 - Look, take it from someone
who has loved and lost.\\
368 - Whatever he did
isn't worth being alone\\
369 - on this holiest of days.\\
370 - Jackie, are you actually thinking
about me instead of yourself?\\
371 - Yeah. God! I've had
way too much sugar.\\
372 - Look, Eric, we need to talk.\\
373 - Before, I told you everything
was fine when it wasn't.\\
374 - So I'm sorry for not
letting you know\\
375 - what a colossally insensitive
bonehead you are.\\
376 - Oh! Apology
accepted.\\
377 - That's...
Very big of you.\\
378 - No, I'm serious. So from
now on when you piss me off,\\
379 - I will do you the courtesy
of blowing up in your face.\\
380 - Oh, Donna, that's all I ask.\\
381 - And as for my part,\\
382 - I've realized that
somewhere along the way\\
383 - we crossed a line where
pulling down your pants in public\\
384 - is really no longer that funny.\\
385 - And I suppose that point came\\
386 - when you started letting me\\
387 - pull them down in private.\\
388 - Exactly.\\
389 - So...\\
390 - Are we good?\\
391 - Yeah, no.\\
392 - Are we good now?\\
393 - Getting there.\\
394 - Just... come on. Let
me put my pants on.\\
395 - Nope.\\
396 - But it's really cold.\\
397 - And, you know, I'm freezing off\\
398 - parts of my body here\\
399 - that I know you've
expressed appreciation for.\\
400 - Eric, for God sakes.\\
401 - No one wants to see that.\\
402 - Yeah. Now we're good.\\
403 - Oh.\\
404 - Something wrong, honey?\\
405 - No. Everything's fine.
\subsection {Episode 16: Romantic Weekend}
1 - - What are you guys up to?
- We're spending
the weekend at a hotel.\\
2 - What, car sex isn't
good enough anymore?\\
3 - I would love car sex.\\
4 - Or just sex.\\
5 - Or just a car.\\
6 - I have to get out of town.
Ever since my dad lost the store\\
7 - he just shuffles around in a
not-completely-closed bathrobe.\\
8 - It's really depressing.\\
9 - "The Wisconsin Dells'
most romantic hideaway.\\
10 - "Hunters and truckers
always welcome."\\
11 - That's nice.\\
12 - Sounds awesome.
I'm gonna go pack.\\
13 - You guys. The weirdest thing
just happened with Pam Macy.\\
14 - Kelso, man, she'll do that with
any guy standing in front of her.\\
15 - Okay. So, I'm making out
with Pam in the orchestra pit,\\
16 - and everything's progressing
like normal until...\\
17 - What?\\
18 - You know, the really, really
bad thing\\
19 - that can happen to guys
when they're with girls.\\
20 - Oh, did Mr. Cooper come in
to buff the floor?\\
21 - No.\\
22 - Okay.\\
23 - Let me put it this way.\\
24 - The buffer wouldn't buff.\\
25 - Poor Mr. Cooper.\\
26 - No, Fez. I think what
he's trying to say is...\\
27 - The rabbit wouldn't come out
of the hat.\\
28 - The weasel wouldn't pop.\\
29 - The alphabet soup
never spelled "Go."\\
30 - Okay! All right! Enough!\\
31 - Actually, not quite.\\
32 - There are a lot of Amish people
but they never raised a barn.\\
33 - Forman, man, that was awesome.\\
34 - Hey. It just came to me.\\
35 - I get it.
The barn is Kelso's pants.\\
36 - Okay, you guys!
This is not funny!\\
37 - This is, like, a nightmare.\\
38 - Yes. Eric, stop teasing.\\
39 - Kelso, I want you to know
that I feel bad for you,\\
40 - and that I am sorry
you are not a man!\\
41 - Hanging out\\
42 - Down the street\\
43 - The same old thing\\
44 - We did last week\\
45 - Not a thing to do\\
46 - But talk to you\\
47 - We're all all right\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
50 - So, looks like I'm gonna have to
spend the weekend with Kelso...\\
51 - Tutor him in math.\\
52 - Really?\\
53 - Hmm.\\
54 - So, you're allegedly tutoring
Kelso in math.\\
55 - Yes, sir.\\
56 - Are you good in math?\\
57 - What's the square root of "X"?\\
58 - - I really can't answer that.
- Aha!\\
59 - No. See, "X" is a variable,\\
60 - so until you define
its parameters,\\
61 - the only possible answer is
a variable, or "X" if you prefer.\\
62 - Is that right?\\
63 - Sounds good.\\
64 - Will Michael's parents be home?\\
65 - Yes.\\
66 - Are they as dumb as he is?\\
67 - I can't lie. Yes.\\
68 - Yes, they are.\\
69 - Right answer.
That was a trick question.\\
70 - I know they're dumb.\\
71 - So...\\
72 - - I can go?
- You can go...\\
73 - But I'll be watching the news.\\
74 - And if anything is vandalized,
or explodes,\\
75 - or catches on fire,\\
76 - "X" is gonna equal
me kicking your ass.\\
77 - So, anyway, Jackie's having
trouble in school stuff\\
78 - and I thought I should
stay with her this weekend,\\
79 - tutor her in, you know, stuff.\\
80 - Anyone?\\
81 - I'm sorry, honey, I can't concentrate
when your father's robe is open.\\
82 - Leave me alone.
I'm ventilating.\\
83 - Okay. See you Sunday.\\
84 - Genie, I'm home.\\
85 - Hello, Genie Jackie.\\
86 - Hello, Master Major Michael.
How was your day?\\
87 - Pretty good, pretty good.
But I'm starving.\\
88 - I've been on the moon all day
and I missed lunch.\\
89 - I can fix that.\\
90 - Damn, I love having a genie.\\
91 - Well, let's eat.\\
92 - Okay, unless you're hungry for
something besides food, Master.\\
93 - Actually, I've been having a little
problem in this department lately.\\
94 - Not anymore.\\
95 - You're the best genie ever!\\
96 - Hello? Pam?\\
97 - I'm back!\\
98 - You know, Red, with the
house empty this weekend,\\
99 - it might be a nice opportunity
for a little romance.\\
100 - Uh-huh.\\
101 - Is that, "Uh-huh, my
passion burns for you"\\
102 - or, "Uh-huh, you're as
exciting as an old hat"?\\
103 - Well, what kind of old hat?\\
104 - How about a hat that's
about to be super PO'ed?\\
105 - Then the passion one.\\
106 - Okay. I'm gonna sneak some beer
out of the fridge. You go be lookout.\\
107 - You can count on me.\\
108 - Hyde, the Formans are home.\\
109 - A little late, Fez.\\
110 - It's funnier this way.\\
111 - Okay, you two, out.\\
112 - Here, you can each have
a Snack Pack.\\
113 - - Thank you, Mrs. Forman.
- Thank you, Mrs. Forman.\\
114 - Ooh. Chocolate.\\
115 - Okay, Kitty.\\
116 - I'm gonna cook you
a romantic dinner.\\
117 - So, you go put on
something pretty\\
118 - and I'll warm up
the toaster oven.\\
119 - Oh, wow!
Dinner from the toaster oven.\\
120 - Well, whoop-de-do.
I'll put on my fancy dress.\\
121 - - Okay. I'm gonna
work on Plan B.
- Oh, I would.\\
122 - This place is awesome.\\
123 - I know. There's gotta be,
like, 17 pillows on this bed.\\
124 - What's this?\\
125 - Oh, my God.
It's a tiny fridge...\\
126 - With, like, a million bottles
of tiny liquor.\\
127 - And tiny cookies.\\
128 - Oh, yeah? Well, in there,
tiny shampoo and tiny soap.\\
129 - Donna, I think elves work here.\\
130 - I feel so classy.\\
131 - I'm stealing all of it.\\
132 - Look, Pam, I'm really sorry
about what happened...\\
133 - Again.\\
134 - I must have the flu
or something.\\
135 - It's not like any flu
I've ever heard of.\\
136 - Well, there's lots of kinds
of flu, Pam!\\
137 - I'm sorry.\\
138 - Oh, well.
Don't take it so hard.\\
139 - Oops. Sorry.\\
140 - Look, just don't tell
anybody, okay?\\
141 - Oh, Flopsy...\\
142 - I'm not gonna tell anybody.\\
143 - I'm gonna tell everybody.\\
144 - Hey, Eric.\\
145 - Do you know that if you mix Kahlua
and Scotch, it tastes just like Dr Pepper?\\
146 - You're cute.\\
147 - Okay.\\
148 - I think you're cute, too...\\
149 - And a little drunk.\\
150 - Which is gonna make my job
a whole lot easier.\\
151 - What's that?\\
152 - I guess the guy next door
thinks we're being too loud.\\
153 - - Oh, yeah?
- What...\\
154 - Oh, my God.
He just pounded right back.\\
155 - Okay. You know what?
Let's just be quiet.\\
156 - But then he wins, Eric.\\
157 - We need to get the last pound.\\
158 - See? We won.\\
159 - We're not gonna take crap. We're
gonna give it 'cause we're fearless.\\
160 - Oh, my God. He's at the door.\\
161 - Okay, you know what?
I think I have a little fear.\\
162 - So, let's just be really quiet
and pretend we're not here,\\
163 - and maybe he'll just think
we're not here.\\
164 - - Okay.
- Okay.\\
165 - Will you cut it out?\\
166 - - Okay, look,
just stay in here and shush.
Okay.\\
167 - - Eric!
- Dad.\\
168 - Hey, it's Big Red.\\
169 - Son of a bitch!\\
170 - What the hell
are you doing here?\\
171 - Wait. What are you doing here?\\
172 - Oh, my God.
Who are you with?\\
173 - Your mother, you dumb ass.\\
174 - Okay. I'm gonna make
a deal with you.\\
175 - I never saw you.
I don't know you're here.\\
176 - Wait. So we're good?\\
177 - No, no, you're getting
your ass kicked on Monday.\\
178 - But for now, you shut up
and stay here.\\
179 - If your mother sees you,
my fun time is over.\\
180 - Oh, this is just awful!\\
181 - Oh. No, hey, cheer up.\\
182 - I've been in trouble
with Red before. It's okay.\\
183 - No, it's not that.\\
184 - It's just seeing your dad
reminded me of my dad.\\
185 - Your dad's going away on
nice weekends and having fun,\\
186 - and my dad's
out of work and sad.\\
187 - Plus your robe's
not completely closed,\\
188 - and that reminds me of him, too.\\
189 - Okay, okay, you know what?\\
190 - Let's turn that frown
upside down.\\
191 - That's right.\\
192 - Let's have super-hot sex, baby.\\
193 - And by super-hot sex, I mean...\\
194 - Let's talk about
your sad feelings.\\
195 - Okay, Jackie, I have some
really terrible news about Kelso\\
196 - that will make us
both laugh a lot.\\
197 - Yeah, I already know. Pam Macy
made this big announcement in gym.\\
198 - Jackie, this is where
we both laugh a lot.\\
199 - Actually, Fez,
I don't find it that funny.\\
200 - I kind of feel sad for him.\\
201 - But you hate him.
He totally screwed you over.\\
202 - Yeah, but he's grown up
a lot since then.\\
203 - And he suffered,
and I'm over it by now.\\
204 - Poor Michael.\\
205 - Poor Michael?\\
206 - Well, I see I have wasted
my time talking to you.\\
207 - Good day, miss.\\
208 - - Wait, Fez.
- I said, good day.\\
209 - What should we do
with all of this time alone?\\
210 - I'll get that.
I ordered you\\
211 - a special surprise. Ta-da!\\
212 - Donna?\\
213 - Donna is my surprise?\\
214 - Donna? What the heck
are you doing here...\\
215 - ...Donna?\\
216 - What the heck?\\
217 - Mrs. Forman,
Eric is being a jerk,\\
218 - and I wanted to talk to my mum,\\
219 - but since she's not here,
can I talk to you?\\
220 - Eric's here, too?\\
221 - What on earth is going on?\\
222 - What the heck?\\
223 - Red, what is going on here?\\
224 - Oh, I'm just as surprised
as you...\\
225 - Oh, all right!\\
226 - Eric and Donna are the
noisy people next door.\\
227 - And you didn't tell me?\\
228 - Hello, Mummy?\\
229 - I'm sad!\\
230 - Donna, where have you...\\
231 - Your mother kicked me out.\\
232 - Oh, no.\\
233 - I said no.\\
234 - Guys, I got to
tell you something.\\
235 - I'm omnipotent.\\
236 - Huh.\\
237 - This does taste like Dr Pepper.\\
238 - Told you.\\
239 - Hey, you know what?
I think I might puke.\\
240 - Oh, no, no.\\
241 - No, honey, nobody gets sick
in Mr. and Mrs. Forman's room.\\
242 - You know, it is a lovely room.\\
243 - Red just saw the brochure
on the counter,\\
244 - and then he whisked me up
and he brought me here.\\
245 - It was very Humphrey Bogart.\\
246 - Eric did the same thing for me.\\
247 - - Sometimes he's really sweet.
- Mmm-hmm.\\
248 - Do you have a bucket?\\
249 - Room service!\\
250 - Honey, honey,
pretty girls do not throw up.\\
251 - Oh, no, no. No, no.
I didn't order this.\\
252 - Oh, it was ordered
by a Mr. Red Forman.\\
253 - Oh, my gosh. This must
have been his surprise.\\
254 - Flowers, champagne.\\
255 - Cashews.\\
256 - The most expensive nut,
you know.\\
257 - Oh, dear, sweet Red. I have to
go see him. Are you feeling better?\\
258 - - No.
- Okay, good. Nighty-night.\\
259 - Why is everything doing that?\\
260 - Hey, Michael.\\
261 - I heard what happened with
Pam. And I want you to know\\
262 - that according to Cosmopolitan
magazine, you're not a freak.\\
263 - - Really?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
264 - They say that lots of times
when it happens to a guy,\\
265 - it's not that he can't, it's just
that he secretly doesn't want to.\\
266 - Okay, not to criticize,\\
267 - but Cosmo's never seen
Pam Macy naked.\\
268 - Michael, just think about it.
Do you like Pam?\\
269 - I like parts of her.\\
270 - Well, maybe that's not enough.\\
271 - And maybe your body's mature enough
to realize that, even if your brain isn't.\\
272 - Okay, well, you know...\\
273 - If this is about maturity, then
I want nothing to do with it.\\
274 - Look, Michael,
don't worry, okay?\\
275 - When you find the girl
you're meant to be with\\
276 - you'll be able to do all the
stuff you want. I promise.\\
277 - I hope you're right.\\
278 - Thanks, Jackie.\\
279 - - I'm back.
- What?\\
280 - Nothing. Good hug!\\
281 - Out.\\
282 - But it's my room.\\
283 - Love you, sweetie.\\
284 - Donna.\\
285 - Donna, are you there?\\
286 - Donna, please open
the door, please.\\
287 - Great. I'm locked out
of both rooms.\\
288 - Well, at least I don't
have any pants!\\
289 - I want you to open
that door right now.\\
290 - Our daughter's in there,
and she's drunk.\\
291 - I really shouldn't be
doing this.\\
292 - Okay. Then I'll just sue you.
Until you're dead.\\
293 - - You get off my daughter!
- Bob! What the hell?\\
294 - Red?\\
295 - Ooh, Kitty,
what a pretty nightgown.\\
296 - Thank you, Midge.\\
297 - Could you hand it to me, please?\\
298 - Look, I'm sorry about
getting all tipsy last night.\\
299 - Oh, no, please, I'm sorry.\\
300 - The fight was all my fault.\\
301 - Fight? We had a fight?\\
302 - No.\\
303 - - What did you do?
- Nothing.\\
304 - Obviously you did something.\\
305 - I want to know what it is,
in case I'm still mad about it.\\
306 - Well, okay.\\
307 - I said that you were the most
beautiful girl in the world,\\
308 - and then you got all mad\\
309 - and said,
"Get bent."\\
310 - Not your finest hour,
but I still love you.\\
311 - Wow. You must be really
upset about this.\\
312 - Um...\\
313 - Kind of, yeah.\\
314 - Come on, Eric. Let's turn
that frown upside down.\\
315 - That's right. Let's have
super-hot sex, baby.\\
316 - Oh, crap.\\
317 - Well, Genie Jackie,
I am in the mood\\
318 - for some hot
master-genie loving.\\
319 - Oh, I'm sorry,
Master Major Michael.\\
320 - But what we are going to have\\
321 - is a warm
master-genie friendship.\\
322 - In fact, I am the master now,
and you are the genie.\\
323 - Except you will not have
any genie powers.\\
324 - You will just do as I say.\\
325 - Now, do my math homework, Genie.\\
326 - No!
\subsection {Episode 17: Kitty's Birthday (That's Today!)}
1 - Wow, Hyde, I can't believe it.\\
2 - Your own set of wheels.\\
3 - Yup. She is the best thing
that ever happened to me.\\
4 - Oh, except for that one time\\
5 - Kelso swallowed that fishhook.\\
6 - That was pretty cool, too.\\
7 - Yeah, that was one magic
trick I could never get right.\\
8 - All right, Hyde.
This car is fine,\\
9 - but, I mean,
it's no Vista Cruiser.\\
10 - How many miles are you
getting to the gallon?\\
11 - Uh, about 11.\\
12 - Damn. Okay, fine,\\
13 - but, you know, the Vista
Cruiser can seat eight...\\
14 - Nine if someone sits
on the stain.\\
15 - Yeah, okay, Forman,
but do you have any idea\\
16 - how many chicks
I can fit in the flatbed?\\
17 - Thirty-two, and that's
with big Rhonda.\\
18 - Damn!\\
19 - Eww!\\
20 - Oh, hello.\\
21 - What are you doing
back there, Fez?\\
22 - I...
I was...\\
23 - I was just showing Caroline\\
24 - the back of my new car
and my tongue.\\
25 - Fez, this isn't your car.\\
26 - Foreigners can't drive
here unless it's a cab.\\
27 - Shut up.\\
28 - Isn't he cute?\\
29 - Fezzy, I told you,\\
30 - you don't have to try
and impress me anymore.\\
31 - I'm your girlfriend now.\\
32 - Oh, I'm sorry, Caroline.\\
33 - From now on, I will be
totally honest.\\
34 - Good. Now, come on.
Walk me home.\\
35 - Ah, yes, and on the
way, I could tell you\\
36 - about the time I killed
a shark with a coconut.\\
37 - All right, Kelso,
let's go out cruising\\
38 - for hot chicks with
self-esteem problems.\\
39 - Yeah. No, thanks, man.\\
40 - I don't do that stuff anymore.\\
41 - Shut up and come on.\\
42 - No, man, I mean it.\\
43 - I've matured.\\
44 - Hey, Donna,
wanna go to the mall?\\
45 - Rerun from What's Happening!!\\
46 - Is opening up
the new Dairy Queen.\\
47 - Actually, Jackie, as fun
as that sounds, um... no.\\
48 - What?\\
49 - Hey, hey, hey!\\
50 - I'm in!\\
51 - Okay, well, let me get my beret\\
52 - and some Certs with Retsyn.\\
53 - Cool.\\
54 - Wait a second, man. You're
too mature to go cruising with me,\\
55 - but you'll go to the mall
with Jackie?\\
56 - It's this new thing we're
trying, man. We're friends.\\
57 - See, I did some
reflecting, and I realized\\
58 - that Jackie is the only
girl I want to be with.\\
59 - Today?\\
60 - No. Every day.\\
61 - See, we were
meant to be together.\\
62 - She just doesn't know it yet.\\
63 - Yeah, but I have a plan.\\
64 - Oh, no.\\
65 - Oh, yeah.\\
66 - See, she wants to be
just friends, right?\\
67 - Okay, so I'll be her friend,\\
68 - but what she doesn't realize\\
69 - is that I'm also a boy.\\
70 - Yeah, and sooner or later,\\
71 - "friend" is gonna lead
down the path to "boy,"\\
72 - and then I'll be
her "friend-boy."\\
73 - That is a great plan.\\
74 - Okay, I'm ready.
Hey.\\
75 - Let's go, friend.\\
76 - Okay.\\
77 - That is such a bad plan.\\
78 - Yeah, but, you know,
on the bright side,\\
79 - maybe we'll be there when
it all blows up in his face.\\
80 - Hangin' out\\
81 - Down the street\\
82 - The same old thing\\
83 - We did last week\\
84 - Not a thing to do\\
85 - But talk to you\\
86 - We're all all right\\
87 - We're all all right\\
88 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
89 - Hey, Mrs. Forman.\\
90 - Happy birthday.\\
91 - Oh!\\
92 - I can't believe you remembered.\\
93 - You are the first person
to say anything all day.\\
94 - And how did you know\\
95 - I needed more flashbulbs?\\
96 - Thank you.\\
97 - So, do you want
to stay for dinner?\\
98 - Oh, no, thanks. I'm just
gonna grab a sandwich.\\
99 - A sandwich?\\
100 - Steven, a sandwich is a
sandwich, but a Manwich is a meal.\\
101 - Oh, well,
thanks, Mrs. Forman.\\
102 - Uh-huh.\\
103 - Hey, Mom. What's
for dinner? I'm starving.\\
104 - Manwiches.\\
105 - Again?\\
106 - Aah! We just had those.\\
107 - Kitty, I left my shirt
on the bed.\\
108 - It needs to be ironed
for tomorrow.\\
109 - Okay.
Oh, and, uh...\\
110 - I know you think I forgot,\\
111 - but I didn't.\\
112 - Oh, Red, I knew you'd remember.\\
113 - Yup.\\
114 - The check for the plumber
is on the dresser.\\
115 - Oh. Good.\\
116 - Um...\\
117 - Is there anything else to eat?\\
118 - Well, you know what, honey?\\
119 - I don't give a good
gosh darn what you eat!\\
120 - Wow. She's really upset.\\
121 - Yeah. Nice going.\\
122 - See, the boatneck adds
dimension to your shoulders,\\
123 - and the plum color,\\
124 - that really accents
your jewel-toned eyes.\\
125 - Oh, my God.\\
126 - Michael, you just
described my perfect outfit.\\
127 - You are so good at this.\\
128 - Yeah, I have a knack
for ensembles.\\
129 - Hey, Hyde.\\
130 - How goes
the cruisin' for chicks?\\
131 - It was going fine
until I hit a patch of ice\\
132 - and almost took out
a few of 'em.\\
133 - Big Rhonda
cracked my brake light.\\
134 - Hi.\\
135 - Hey.\\
136 - Have you seen Fez?\\
137 - Uh...\\
138 - No. He went bowling
with his host parents.\\
139 - Damn him!\\
140 - I'm sorry.\\
141 - I was just hoping he'd be here\\
142 - so we could study together.\\
143 - Now I have to walk home
alone in the dark.\\
144 - It's scary out there.\\
145 - Somebody ran over big Rhonda.\\
146 - Um, do you want a...
Okay!\\
147 - You know, Michael, I'm really
enjoying our time together.\\
148 - Really? Me, too.\\
149 - Yeah, you know,
the makeup, shopping,\\
150 - braiding each other's hair...\\
151 - You are like
the girlfriend I never had.\\
152 - Well, thanks, Jackie.\\
153 - Wait... girlfriend?\\
154 - Yeah, I mean,
Donna's nice and everything,\\
155 - but she kind of dresses
like a trucker.\\
156 - The Waltons...\\
157 - Now, there's a grateful family.\\
158 - Hmm.\\
159 - And, boy, did they
love their mother.\\
160 - Oh, great.\\
161 - I think I've got athlete's foot.\\
162 - I am... I am...
I am going to bed.\\
163 - Where'd your mother go?\\
164 - To bed.\\
165 - Hey, what's wrong
with her, anyway?\\
166 - Oh, who knows?\\
167 - She's been moody all day.\\
168 - Let me see the TV Guide.\\
169 - Let's see.
What day is it?\\
170 - Ahh!\\
171 - It's the 13th.
You know, it seems to me\\
172 - I was supposed to do
something on the 13th.\\
173 - Oh, good Lord!\\
174 - You forgot
your mother's birthday!\\
175 - Oh, no, Dad.
This is bad.\\
176 - This is very, very bad.\\
177 - All right.\\
178 - Don't start getting all twitchy.\\
179 - Now, we gotta think.\\
180 - Let's watch CHiPs and think.\\
181 - So, Fez is really nice, huh?\\
182 - Yeah. Fez is a good guy.\\
183 - Yeah.\\
184 - You know, sometimes, when
I'm trying to sleep at night,\\
185 - I think about how much it
would hurt if he ever left me.\\
186 - And then I say
Fez would never leave me.\\
187 - But then I say we've only
been going out a short time.\\
188 - Maybe he would leave me.\\
189 - So then I hold my breath until
my lungs are about to explode,\\
190 - because that's how much
I think it would hurt\\
191 - if he ever did leave me.\\
192 - And then, when
I regain consciousness...\\
193 - I start breathing again,
and everything's fine.\\
194 - Oops! There's my house.
Thanks. Bye.\\
195 - See ya.\\
196 - Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!\\
197 - Oh, you remembered.\\
198 - Well, of course
we remembered, honey.\\
199 - We just figured that we'd wait\\
200 - until there was only
15 minutes left in the day\\
201 - and you were good and mad\\
202 - and then we'd sneak up here\\
203 - and surprise
the hell out of you.\\
204 - Wow. What a good plan,\\
205 - 'cause I was awfully mad.\\
206 - Yeah. We really
had you going.\\
207 - Here, Mom.
Open this one first.\\
208 - It's from me.\\
209 - Well, thank you, honey.\\
210 - Oh.\\
211 - A map of Wisconsin.\\
212 - Oh, well, thank you.\\
213 - And, Mom, I got you
these balloons, too.\\
214 - "Knock out the knock
knocks at Schiffy's Gas-n-Go."\\
215 - Huh.\\
216 - Wait, Kitty, there's more.\\
217 - A funnel.\\
218 - 'Cause I know how much
you like to pour things.\\
219 - Well, um...\\
220 - Either these gifts
are really thoughtful,\\
221 - or you bought a bunch
of crap at the gas station.\\
222 - What?\\
223 - Oh, admit it, Red Forman.\\
224 - You forgot my birthday.\\
225 - Quick, Dad,
give her the lighter.\\
226 - Look, Kitty, I'm sorry,\\
227 - but... it's just...\\
228 - Well, marking the calendar
is your responsibility.\\
229 - Dad, no!\\
230 - Ah, good morning, sunshine!\\
231 - So, what's for breakfast?\\
232 - A funnel.\\
233 - Ow.\\
234 - I mean, what the heck makes
Jackie think I'm her girlfriend?\\
235 - All I did was pick out
a few of her outfits,\\
236 - paint her nails,
and give her a facial.\\
237 - Gee, I don't know, Denise.\\
238 - Um, guys, can we go inside?\\
239 - I'm freezing my choo-choos off.\\
240 - No way.\\
241 - I'm not going in there.\\
242 - I forgot my mom's birthday.\\
243 - Really? 'Cause I remembered
your mom's birthday.\\
244 - If you remembered,
why didn't you tell me?\\
245 - How would that be funny?\\
246 - I will never have to worry\\
247 - about forgetting
Caroline's birthday.\\
248 - She wrote it on my arm
with permanent marker.\\
249 - Isn't she sweet?\\
250 - More like psycho.\\
251 - What are you doing
calling my girlfriend psycho?\\
252 - Oh, I'm sorry, Fez.
Did I say psycho?\\
253 - I meant nutbag,
headcase, whackadoo.\\
254 - She chokes herself, man!\\
255 - Well, Hyde, maybe...
Maybe you should...\\
256 - Maybe you should choke yourself!\\
257 - Good day.\\
258 - Fez...\\
259 - I said good day!\\
260 - Man, what fun is it
being a girlfriend\\
261 - if you don't even have
your own boobs to play with?\\
262 - So what, Kelso?
So you're her girlfriend.\\
263 - What could possibly
be so bad about that?\\
264 - I'll... I'll tell you
what could be so bad.\\
265 - Oh, Michael.\\
266 - This is the happiest
day of my life.\\
267 - Thank you so much for
being my maid of honor.\\
268 - That's what girlfriends do.\\
269 - I'm just honored you asked me.\\
270 - Yeah, but...\\
271 - You know, on the flip side,\\
272 - try to think about your life
without Jackie at all.\\
273 - Wow.\\
274 - That's even worse.\\
275 - Hey, girlfriends sometimes
make out together, right?\\
276 - Yeah. Usually right after
long, sweaty pillow fights.\\
277 - Yeah, man,
it happens all the time.\\
278 - All right!\\
279 - Hey, Mrs. Forman.\\
280 - Is Eric home?\\
281 - Eric?\\
282 - Oh, you mean
my son the map giver.\\
283 - I don't know, and I don't care.\\
284 - Mrs. Forman,
are you okay?\\
285 - Oh, I am just freakin' fine!\\
286 - What happened?\\
287 - Well, you know I love my family.\\
288 - It's just sometimes
I want to get in the car\\
289 - and run 'em all over.\\
290 - They forgot my birthday.\\
291 - I'm gonna go kick
Eric's ass right now!\\
292 - No.\\
293 - I mean, it's one thing
when they don't notice\\
294 - when I get my hair done
differently, which they don't...\\
295 - But this is my birthday.\\
296 - Oh, I don't know.
Maybe I expect too much.\\
297 - No, Mrs. Forman, you
have every right to be mad.\\
298 - In fact, you should be madder.\\
299 - You're, like, the best
mom in the world.\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - Thank you, Donna.\\
302 - I just wish my own family
would say that once in a while.\\
303 - Oh, sweetie, that's
not your breakfast, is it?\\
304 - Yeah.\\
305 - Oh.\\
306 - Why don't you just let me make
you some nice waffles instead?\\
307 - Oh, cool.
I love frozen waffles.\\
308 - Oh, honey, no, no, no, no.\\
309 - I make my waffles from scratch.\\
310 - Those bastards!\\
311 - God, would you look
at her boobs?\\
312 - I am.\\
313 - And it's... it's...
Disgusting.\\
314 - I mean, what is she thinking,\\
315 - packing in those
sweet melons like that?\\
316 - I can't even look away.\\
317 - You know, Michael, I have to say\\
318 - I'm really enjoying
our new friendship together.\\
319 - I love spending time with you.\\
320 - Me, too. Hey, do you want
to go back to your house\\
321 - and have a nice, sweaty
pillow fight?\\
322 - Okay!\\
323 - Hello, Caroline.\\
324 - Oh, hi, Fez.\\
325 - So, hey, listen.
Just curious, um...\\
326 - Do you sometimes choke yourself?\\
327 - Yeah, but I only do it\\
328 - because I love you more
than anything in the world.\\
329 - Okay, I'm good with that.\\
330 - I'll get you a soda, lover.\\
331 - Don't forget to breathe
while I'm gone.\\
332 - Hey, so how's it going
with mental Mary?\\
333 - I owe you an apology, Hyde.\\
334 - She is crazy.\\
335 - But she's crazy for me.\\
336 - Ooh! Here she comes.\\
337 - Oh, my God. She
didn't even look at us.\\
338 - I don't think I've ever seen
Mom so mad. Have you?\\
339 - Not since she stopped drinking.\\
340 - What?\\
341 - Nothing.\\
342 - Look, obviously your mother's
very upset about something...\\
343 - And desperate times
call for desperate measures.\\
344 - For the last 10 years,\\
345 - she's been asking us
to do something,\\
346 - and every time, we say no,\\
347 - because what she wants\\
348 - is the most horrible thing
in the world.\\
349 - I won't do it.\\
350 - Oh, you will do it.\\
351 - And you will like it!\\
352 - I can't believe
we're finally square-dancing.\\
353 - Oh, this is so much fun!\\
354 - Looks like Hee Haw
puked in here.\\
355 - Come on, honey.
Let's dance!\\
356 - Oh, my God.
This is awful.\\
357 - She made me waffles.\\
358 - Now promenade,
you son of a bitch!\\
359 - Bow to your partner,
corners, all\\
360 - Circle to the left
all around that hall\\
361 - Circle to the left
all around you go\\
362 - When you're there,
you'll meet\\
363 - Do an allemande left
with your corner mate\\
364 - Do-si-do with
your partner there\\
365 - Then star by the left
in the middle\\
366 - Go all the way around
and then\\
367 - Star promenade,
go around that town\\
368 - Then when you're there
then you backtrack\\
369 - Go the other way around\\
370 - Meet a partner, turn a
partner by the right hand round\\
371 - Do an allemande left
walk right in through\\
372 - Whee hee!\\
373 - So, Mom...\\
374 - We found this present
we just had to get you.\\
375 - So... Happy birthday.\\
376 - Oh, I thought square-dance
night was my present.\\
377 - It is, but we really
messed up this year,\\
378 - and, well, we're sorry.\\
379 - Oh!\\
380 - "World's darn-tootinest Mom."\\
381 - Do you really think so?\\
382 - You're darn tootin'.\\
383 - Okay, well...\\
384 - I think I've had enough
do-si-dos for one night,\\
385 - so what do you say
we all go home\\
386 - and have hot fudge sundaes?\\
387 - Thank God!
Yes.\\
388 - Bastards.\\
389 - Valentine's Day.
Check.\\
390 - Anniversary.\\
391 - Check.\\
392 - Mother's Day.\\
393 - Check.\\
394 - Well, I think we got 'em all.\\
395 - Uh, Dad, we forgot
her birthday again.\\
396 - Damn it, Eric!
Pay attention.\\
397 - Valentine's Day.\\
398 - Check.\\
399 - Anniversary.\\
400 - Check.\\
401 - Mother's Day.
Check.
\subsection {Episode 18: The Trials of M. Kelso}
1 - So if "x" equals seven,
then "y" equals...\\
2 - Two?\\
3 - Wrong. Kelso?\\
4 - "L?"\\
5 - Also wrong. It's a pretty
simple equation, guys.\\
6 - Just think about
it for a second.\\
7 - You're so pretty.\\
8 - You don't even
need to know math.\\
9 - That's so weird. I was
just thinking the same thing.\\
10 - Steven, you're so pretty, you
don't need to know nothing.\\
11 - That's good, 'cause I'm stupid.\\
12 - Real mature, guys.\\
13 - Fez, what happened?\\
14 - I was walking back
from the pep rally,\\
15 - flush with school spirit\\
16 - when some boys from Fort
Anderson, they jumped me,\\
17 - and they slapped me,
and they beat me.\\
18 - And look at what they did
to my pom-poms.\\
19 - Hey, that's not funny, man.\\
20 - It's really not.\\
21 - They spray-painted me on my ass.\\
22 - I want revenge against those
Fort Anderson Snapping Turtles.\\
23 - Look, Fez, I'll tell you what.\\
24 - Let's go to the garage and
I'll get you some paint thinner.\\
25 - No.\\
26 - I'm sorry, Fez.
It has to be done.\\
27 - Yeah, and the three
of us have to watch.\\
28 - Fine. But this time, no smoking.\\
29 - Great. Now maybe
we can get some work done.\\
30 - Michael's so sweet.\\
31 - Uh-oh.\\
32 - He's just so...
No!\\
33 - Do you think
that Michael and I...\\
34 - Don't even say it, Jackie.\\
35 - I think maybe...\\
36 - I'll kill myself,
I swear to God.\\
37 - He and I should
get back together.\\
38 - Jackie, do you remember
how Kelso cheated...\\
39 - And hurt you, and lied to you?\\
40 - Listen to yourself, Donna.\\
41 - "Cheat-ed. Hurt-ed. Lie-duh."\\
42 - It's all ancient history.\\
43 - But when we look into
each other's eyes...\\
44 - I know we're both thinking
about the same thing.\\
45 - Your hair?\\
46 - No. That we're
meant to be together.\\
47 - Look, I need to know
that he's really changed.\\
48 - I need to test him somehow.\\
49 - I agree.
You do?\\
50 - Absolutely.\\
51 - If you get back with Kelso,
you better have him tested.\\
52 - Hanging out\\
53 - Down the street\\
54 - The same old thing\\
55 - We did last week\\
56 - Not a thing to do\\
57 - But talk to you\\
58 - We're all all right\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
61 - Okay. I want to see
if Michael is ready\\
62 - to be in a healthy,
adult relationship.\\
63 - So I've come up with
five psychological tests.\\
64 - Damn, Jackie. He can't
even spell "psychological."\\
65 - Look, besides, he only
has to get three out of five.\\
66 - And the first
test is on maturity.\\
67 - Oh, man.\\
68 - So we're trying to get the
paint off of Fez's butt, right?\\
69 - And so I started to
spray lighter fluid on it.\\
70 - And Fez gets all mad, right?\\
71 - And then he started chasing me,\\
72 - but he had his
pants around his ankles.\\
73 - So then he tripped and fell,
and I think he hurt himself\\
74 - but I don't know, 'cause
I was, like, out of there.\\
75 - So what's going
on with you guys?\\
76 - Donna and I were
discussing our careers.\\
77 - I'm going into
high-end cosmetics\\
78 - and Donna thinks she'll
make a great lumberjack.\\
79 - Stop telling everybody that.\\
80 - So what kind of career
do you see yourself in?\\
81 - Well, I was
considering becoming a doctor.\\
82 - Ooh, a doctor?
That's so mature.\\
83 - Or a rodeo clown.\\
84 - Rodeo clown? You want
to be a rodeo clown. Why?\\
85 - The rodeo clowns are the
unsung heroes of the new West.\\
86 - And you know I've always
enjoyed being inside of barrels.\\
87 - Cheese puffs!\\
88 - Well, see, they're not for you.\\
89 - They're for Bob
and Midge's party.\\
90 - Bob and Midge
are having a party?\\
91 - Well, I can't go.\\
92 - I'm very busy.\\
93 - Wait. Bob didn't invite you?\\
94 - No, but thanks for the heads-up.
I'll be sure to avoid them.\\
95 - Huh...\\
96 - Midge didn't invite me either.\\
97 - But I'm sure
they're having a party.\\
98 - I saw them bring a keg and
a lot of chairs into the house.\\
99 - Well, you don't know
that they're having a party.\\
100 - Bob's out of work.\\
101 - The two of them might be
starting some weirdo church.\\
102 - You know,
the kind of church where\\
103 - you sit around on
chairs and drink beer.\\
104 - I'm sure Midge will
be over any minute.\\
105 - The last minute,
like always, to invite us.\\
106 - I tell you.\\
107 - I like the sound
of a beer church.\\
108 - Hi, neighbor. I have
something I want to ask you.\\
109 - Oh, really?\\
110 - Can I borrow
your big punch bowl?\\
111 - A big punch bowl?\\
112 - Oh, my, what would that be for?\\
113 - I should have
thought this through.\\
114 - You know, forget about it. I'm
gonna get someone else to bring it.\\
115 - And by "someone else,"
I mean Bob.\\
116 - Midge, I...\\
117 - I already made
your cheese puffs.\\
118 - Ooh. Thanks.\\
119 - Mmm.\\
120 - Boy, all these cheese puffs
are really gonna come in handy.\\
121 - 'Cause Bob's so hungry.\\
122 - We're not having a party.\\
123 - This next test is
about consideration.\\
124 - I want to see if he'll choose
my interests over his.\\
125 - This is gonna be so funny.\\
126 - Grape.\\
127 - So, Michael...\\
128 - There are two events
occurring this weekend.\\
129 - One that you might like\\
130 - and one that I would really,
really, really want to go to.\\
131 - Now, should we go see the
Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders...\\
132 - Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.\\
133 - Yes, or...\\
134 - No.
Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.\\
135 - But, Michael, I want...\\
136 - No.
Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders!\\
137 - See? Funny.\\
138 - Kelso, what are you doing?\\
139 - We're just
tossing around this egg\\
140 - Jackie gave me to take care of.\\
141 - Don't you think it might break?\\
142 - Yeah, well, you know, we just
thought we'd have some fun with it\\
143 - before I threw it at somebody.\\
144 - You're such a moron.\\
145 - You're so gonna
fail Jackie's test.\\
146 - Test? What test?\\
147 - Okay, I'm not supposed to say
anything, but Jackie's testing you\\
148 - to see if you're ready
to get back together.\\
149 - Oh, my God. Are you serious?\\
150 - Do you think I have a chance?\\
151 - Not a good one.\\
152 - You've already failed two tests\\
153 - and you're about
to fail the third.\\
154 - That egg is a test of
your parenting ability.\\
155 - So what you're saying is,
if I break that egg\\
156 - then I fail the test,
and lose Jackie...\\
157 - The girl I love more than
anything in the world?\\
158 - Hyde, give me the egg.\\
159 - Okay, catch.\\
160 - Whoops.\\
161 - I mean...\\
162 - Okay, you guys...\\
163 - Let's do this for Fez.\\
164 - Finally my butt cheeks
will be avenged.\\
165 - Voila.\\
166 - Guys, I feel like we
accomplished something today.\\
167 - I feel like we
made a difference.\\
168 - I'm not done yet. Taste
my wrath, Snapping Turtles!\\
169 - That was a close one.\\
170 - Crap!
The janitor locked us in.\\
171 - Yep.
No good deed goes unpunished.\\
172 - My God.
How could this get any worse?\\
173 - Okay, guys,\\
174 - we have 20 seconds until the
cherry bomb in the toilet goes off.\\
175 - Hey, guys.
Hi.\\
176 - What's that?\\
177 - It's just this little crib-like
thing I made for Eggy.\\
178 - "Eggy?"\\
179 - Yeah, I named him.\\
180 - I don't know, this egg is, like,\\
181 - bringing out all
the parental stuff in me.\\
182 - Michael, what happened to the
pencil mark I made on the bottom?\\
183 - Must have come off when I
was giving him his gentle bath.\\
184 - Nice.\\
185 - Michael,
I knew you had this in you.\\
186 - You are gonna make
a great dad one day.\\
187 - Yeah.\\
188 - Uh-oh.\\
189 - Somebody needs a change.\\
190 - I just can't believe
Midge would do this\\
191 - after all the years
we've been friends.\\
192 - She took the cheese puffs.\\
193 - All the cheese puffs?\\
194 - What the hell?
I wanted some of those.\\
195 - Red, this isn't
about the cheese puffs.\\
196 - Well, maybe not for you.\\
197 - They're so light and fluffy.\\
198 - This is all your fault.
What?\\
199 - You're always mean to them.\\
200 - Now you've driven them away.
I hope you're happy.\\
201 - Actually, Kitty, I am happy.\\
202 - Them not inviting us to the
party is not the end of the world.\\
203 - In fact, it's the start
of a beautiful new world...\\
204 - A world where we don't
get invited to the Pinciottis'.\\
205 - There's no talking to you.\\
206 - You're just sour.\\
207 - You're an old, sour crab apple.\\
208 - Why are you yelling at me?\\
209 - I'm not the one that
didn't invite you to a party.\\
210 - If you've got something to
say, you say it to the Pinciottis.\\
211 - Well, you talked me into
it, Red Forman. Let's go.\\
212 - Oh, no.\\
213 - Look at us...\\
214 - Locked in a locker room.\\
215 - Oh, the irony is not lost on me.\\
216 - Why do you mock us, fate?\\
217 - Okay, you guys, we gotta think
about a way to get out of here.\\
218 - Okay,
guys, I've just gone through\\
219 - every escape-from-prison movie\\
220 - I could think of,
and I came up with something.\\
221 - What?\\
222 - Steve McQueen is
a total bad-ass.\\
223 - Okay, thanks, Hyde.
That's not helping.\\
224 - If we don't get out of here,
a bunch of jocks are gonna\\
225 - come in here and kick our asses.\\
226 - Why did I put
a cherry bomb in the toilet?\\
227 - It doesn't smell
like cherries at all.\\
228 - Come on, guys, think.\\
229 - Yeah, yeah. Right.
Gotta be something we can do.\\
230 - I got it.\\
231 - Much better.\\
232 - Yeah.\\
233 - Now instead of feeling scared
and anxious, I feel relaxed and...\\
234 - Relaxed.\\
235 - I know we're
probably gonna get beaten,\\
236 - but it was worth it
because we've shown\\
237 - we have
tremendous school spirit.\\
238 - Go Vikings.\\
239 - School spirit is
for losers, man.\\
240 - You're just,
like, floating along\\
241 - on a conveyor
belt of conformity.\\
242 - Pep rallies, extracurricular
activities, washing your hair.\\
243 - It's all just a trap, man.\\
244 - Yeah, Fez. It's one thing
to root for a football team\\
245 - but to confuse
the Point Place Vikings\\
246 - with a sense of personal
identity, that's just...\\
247 - ...relaxing.\\
248 - We're all gonna die tomorrow.\\
249 - Michael, I have some bad news.\\
250 - I just found out I have BHD.\\
251 - "BHD?"\\
252 - Yeah. Brittle Hair Disease.\\
253 - I have to go to
the hospital tomorrow\\
254 - and get all my hair shaved off.\\
255 - So you'll be...\\
256 - Bald, Michael.\\
257 - B-A-L-D.
No hair, shiny head, bald.\\
258 - And my hair won't
ever grow back, either.\\
259 - Will you still
love me when I'm bald?\\
260 - You could wear a wig.\\
261 - So, Michael, are you saying
that you would not love me\\
262 - if I didn't have a luscious,
full-bodied head of hair?\\
263 - Oh!\\
264 - No, Jackie. No, I would
love you even more.\\
265 - You know, I would shave off
my hair and paste it to your head.\\
266 - Michael, that's beautiful.\\
267 - Nice job.
Thanks.\\
268 - That was a test, right?
Because bald chicks are gross.\\
269 - Look at that.\\
270 - They closed the blinds
so we couldn't see the party.\\
271 - But I can hear them.\\
272 - I can hear you, Bob and Midge!
I can hear your party!\\
273 - Kitty and Red.\\
274 - We're very busy in here.\\
275 - Yes, we're very busy.
We'll talk tomorrow.\\
276 - You're having a party
and you didn't invite us.\\
277 - And I thought we were friends,
and we're not.\\
278 - And I'll tell
you something else.\\
279 - You're naked.\\
280 - You have no clothes on. Why
don't you have any clothes on?\\
281 - Well, we're having a nudist
party with our fellow nudists.\\
282 - We're nudists.\\
283 - And we're not.\\
284 - So you didn't invite us.\\
285 - So thank you.\\
286 - Come on, Red. Let's go.\\
287 - Whoa, whoa, Kitty.
What are you saying?\\
288 - You really wanted
to attend this party.\\
289 - Stop it, Red.\\
290 - No, no, no.\\
291 - Now get in there and have
yourself a good old naked time, huh?\\
292 - Who knows? They might
play Twister. Could be fun.\\
293 - Okay, guys,
they can't be mad at us now.\\
294 - Yeah, Fez, I don't
think that's gonna help.\\
295 - All right, here they come.\\
296 - Okay, you guys, here's the plan.\\
297 - Fez, you beg for
mercy in broken English.\\
298 - Hyde, you insist that this
whole thing was a big set-up.\\
299 - And I'll just curl up in the foetal
position and think about pancakes.\\
300 - Got it.
Got it.\\
301 - Oh, my God. We're in
the girls' locker room.\\
302 - Yeah. They're girls.\\
303 - And I thought we were going
to get beaten up for sure.\\
304 - Hey, baby.\\
305 - Hi, Kelso.\\
306 - Hi, Tiffany.\\
307 - I'm so glad I ran into you. I've
been meaning to ask you something.\\
308 - Yeah? What's that?\\
309 - Will you take me back to your
house and make out with me?\\
310 - Well, I don't know. Yeah,
I'm here to meet Jackie, so...\\
311 - I promise she'll never find out.\\
312 - It'd be an afternoon
of secret make-out fun.\\
313 - You can drink grape juice
from my bellybutton.\\
314 - All right, this has
got to be one of Jackie's tests.\\
315 - I mean, Tiffany never comes
on to me. But what if it's not?\\
316 - I mean, let's face it,
I look good today.\\
317 - That new conditioner's
really working out.\\
318 - All right, but the real
question is, should I risk it?\\
319 - And my body says yes,
and my head says yes...\\
320 - And my heart says no.\\
321 - My stupid heart's right.\\
322 - I can't. I mean, I
appreciate the offer and all\\
323 - 'cause you're, like, really hot\\
324 - but the only girl I want to
make out with is Jackie, so...\\
325 - Michael, you did it! You did
it! You passed the last test!\\
326 - Did you believe me, Michael?\\
327 - Yeah, sure.\\
328 - Good, because I'm in Drama
Club, and I really want...\\
329 - Yeah, thank you, Tiffany,
bye-bye.\\
330 - Michael, now I know I can
honestly trust you with all my heart.\\
331 - Jackie...\\
332 - Donna told me about the test.\\
333 - So I knew what was going on,
and I didn't say anything.\\
334 - So maybe I don't deserve
to be with you because...\\
335 - That wasn't very honest of me.\\
336 - But telling me that was.\\
337 - Damn.\\
338 - You're right.
So you'll take me back?\\
339 - Yeah, Michael.\\
340 - I love you, Jackie Burkhart.\\
341 - I love you, too, Michael Kelso.\\
342 - What the hell
happened to you guys?\\
343 - We got beaten up.\\
344 - By men.\\
345 - By big, strong men.\\
346 - Hey, guys,
as I was getting beaten...\\
347 - I think I got to second base.
\subsection {Episode 19: Eric's Naughty No-No}
1 - Oh, my first X-rated movie.\\
2 - I don't know what's going on, but
that is the luckiest pizza boy ever.\\
3 - Yeah, I'll say. There's at least
nine boobs in this shot alone.\\
4 - Guys, I feel bad. I mean,
Jackie finally takes me back...\\
5 - And I reward her by sneaking off\\
6 - to see some trashy porno babes.\\
7 - Oh, wow!\\
8 - That seems like it would tickle.\\
9 - Nothing's going to happen in
this scene. It's just two ladies.\\
10 - Bravo, nice plot twist.\\
11 - All right, guys, I gotta go.\\
12 - I don't think Jackie
would like me being here.\\
13 - And you should pick up
your dress on the way out.\\
14 - Oh, wow!\\
15 - Does everyone do that?\\
16 - Because...\\
17 - I don't do that.\\
18 - I just stick to
two or three key moves and...\\
19 - God, they don't even
come close to that.\\
20 - Oh, Eric,
I have not done anything.\\
21 - But even I, had I done anything,
would have already done that.\\
22 - Hanging out\\
23 - Down the street\\
24 - The same old thing\\
25 - We did last week\\
26 - Not a thing to do\\
27 - But talk to you\\
28 - We're all all right\\
29 - We're all all right\\
30 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
31 - Jackie, you know I love you.\\
32 - And you know
how much I've changed, right?\\
33 - Yeah?\\
34 - What'd you do?\\
35 - I went to a stag film.\\
36 - But then it turned out that
there weren't any stags at all.\\
37 - It was just naked
people having sex.\\
38 - Go ahead and punish me.\\
39 - No, Michael,
I'm not gonna punish you.\\
40 - You were honest with me, and
honesty should be rewarded.\\
41 - Wow!\\
42 - I'm not in trouble
and I get a reward?\\
43 - Is it a cash reward?\\
44 - No, Michael. The reward is
feeling better about yourself.\\
45 - Oh.\\
46 - Mmm.\\
47 - Smells good. What you making?\\
48 - A little lemon meringue
and pot roast...\\
49 - and my sister Paula is coming,
and seven-layer salad.\\
50 - Ah, seven...
Hey, wait a second.\\
51 - Red, now, please, be nice. We
haven't seen her in almost six years.\\
52 - Yeah,
not since she got arrested.\\
53 - No, no, no.
Not arrested, detained.\\
54 - She showed up in the backseat
of a police car with lights flashing.\\
55 - I had to tell the neighbors that
she was the mayor of Cincinnati.\\
56 - There she is.\\
57 - You wait.\\
58 - She's gonna hit me up for
money like she always does.\\
59 - That's gonna cost me.\\
60 - Oh, my God!\\
61 - Kitty!\\
62 - Oh, my God! Look at you!\\
63 - I know, I know, I'm fabulous.\\
64 - Look at me!\\
65 - Oh, my God.\\
66 - You're wearing stockings.
Red, she's wearing stockings.\\
67 - And matching shoes!\\
68 - Come on, Red. I know
you're dying for a nibble.\\
69 - Paula, you're so pink.\\
70 - Well, sure, sure.\\
71 - I gotta match my brand-new car.\\
72 - Go ahead, pet her.\\
73 - Well, ooh.\\
74 - I wanna pet her, too.\\
75 - Why did you paint
it with Pepto-Bismol?\\
76 - It's not Pepto-Bismol.
It's Luscious Blushes.\\
77 - And only the top Kathy May
salesperson gets one of these babies.\\
78 - So you stole it from her?\\
79 - I have all the money
that I owe you. Here it is.\\
80 - Oh, my God. You have cash.
Red, she has cash.\\
81 - Honey, Red, really.
You don't have to count it.\\
82 - Well, of course.
You're family.\\
83 - Honey, honey, honey!\\
84 - Honesty's cool, man.\\
85 - It's like I can do
anything wrong...\\
86 - And then ask for forgiveness,
and then I'm good again.\\
87 - I mean, someone should invent
a religion like that.\\
88 - Okay, so did anyone
besides me think\\
89 - that some of the guys in that
movie were not completely...\\
90 - Average?\\
91 - Like, you know,
they were way, way...\\
92 - Above average?\\
93 - Well, you don't go into that line of
work when you're below average.\\
94 - You just pray some hot,
redheaded neighbor girl\\
95 - likes you for your personality.\\
96 - What are you talking about?
Those men were completely average.\\
97 - In fact, I found the guy with
the mustache downright puny.\\
98 - See now, Fez, that's not honest.\\
99 - I mean, we all know
you're small in the pants.\\
100 - What I'm saying is, is from here
on in, I'm only telling the truth.\\
101 - In fact, I'm gonna come clean
to Jackie about everything.\\
102 - Fine. You want honesty?
I'll give you honesty.\\
103 - We are all small in the pants.\\
104 - Kelso, this might be your
best idea ever. You know what?\\
105 - You should make a list of all
the lies you've ever told to Jackie,\\
106 - and I'll help you.\\
107 - 'Cause all's I really want
is for you to be happy.\\
108 - You guys, honestly, you
don't think Donna's, you know...\\
109 - Bored, right?\\
110 - 'Cause those guys in the movie,\\
111 - they didn't do
the same move twice.\\
112 - And I've done
the same move, like...\\
113 - Always.\\
114 - I'll bet they go to a special
school or something.\\
115 - I mean, they're like
doctors of doing it.\\
116 - Eric, dinner.\\
117 - Oh, no.\\
118 - Now I have to act normal.\\
119 - But I get to eat, yeah!\\
120 - Aunt Paula, you look great.\\
121 - And so pink.\\
122 - Eric, you're so cute.\\
123 - Here's $20.\\
124 - Aunt Paula is awesome!\\
125 - So, Paula, tell me more
about the ship captain.\\
126 - That was just a fling, you know?\\
127 - Didn't you have a fiance
the last time we saw you?\\
128 - Red, now, there is no reason to
rehash ancient history, is there?\\
129 - No, it's okay.\\
130 - It turned out he lived on
some sort of commune\\
131 - where everyone called him God.\\
132 - And there were guns.\\
133 - And I really could never figure
out why God would need a gun.\\
134 - But there were some fun parties.\\
135 - That's hilarious!\\
136 - Life has gotten so much better
since I moved to Indianapolis.\\
137 - I mean, things move so
much faster in the big city.\\
138 - One day you're wondering
if you'll ever find happiness...\\
139 - And the next, you're waving
the starting flag at the Indy 500.\\
140 - You waved the Indy flag?\\
141 - Mmm-hmm.\\
142 - Oh, God, you're the coolest.\\
143 - Mum, how funny is it, that
while Aunt Paula was at Indy,\\
144 - you were probably at,
like, Price Mart?\\
145 - Who wants pie? It's meringue.\\
146 - Well, enough about me.\\
147 - Kitty, dear,
what have you been up to?\\
148 - Well, you know,
it's funny you should ask\\
149 - because we have
been super, super busy.\\
150 - Oh, no. She quit her job.
She's not up to anything.\\
151 - It's kind of boring.\\
152 - So, did you meet Dick Trickle?\\
153 - Eric!\\
154 - What? He's a race car driver.\\
155 - His name is Dick Trickle.\\
156 - Oh, my God, listen to
my voice! I'm so loud!\\
157 - Oh well, will you look at this?\\
158 - Here's me.
Captain of the cheerleaders.\\
159 - "Most likely to succeed."\\
160 - "Best laugh."\\
161 - Here's Paula.\\
162 - What's that on her cheek?\\
163 - She had a little sledding
accident with her face that year.\\
164 - Typical.\\
165 - I know.\\
166 - Things were so different then.\\
167 - Kitty! You so deserve this.
You're the best.\\
168 - Aren't you sweet?\\
169 - Boy, oh, boy,
Chet sure is lucky.\\
170 - He's got the keenest
girl in school.\\
171 - Oh, stop!\\
172 - Congratulations, Kitty.\\
173 - Thanks, Paula.\\
174 - I knew you'd win.
You always do.\\
175 - No, not always.\\
176 - Well, I want a kiss
from the queen.\\
177 - Well, Chet, you have been
an awfully loyal subject.\\
178 - You guys, I'd like you
to meet my date, Marvin.\\
179 - Marvin?\\
180 - Sweetie? Sweetie?\\
181 - Okay.\\
182 - Okay.\\
183 - And now, I'm a housewife...\\
184 - And she goes on
cruises with Dick Trickle.\\
185 - You don't know what
she's not telling you.\\
186 - I mean, just because she's
more successful than you\\
187 - doesn't mean that she's happy.\\
188 - More successful?\\
189 - Well, it's just
that she has so many...\\
190 - And she's very...\\
191 - Look, money.\\
192 - I love it when you do that.\\
193 - Good to know. Good to know.\\
194 - And how about when I do this?\\
195 - Geez, Eric, what the hell?\\
196 - Okay, okay, I'll just
go back up to the ear.\\
197 - Get away from me, you pig!\\
198 - Where are my pants?\\
199 - Wait. Wait,
it was an accident.\\
200 - Look, I have a feather.\\
201 - He did?\\
202 - What the heck for?\\
203 - I don't know.\\
204 - In like what
universe is that sexy?\\
205 - Only one,
the skinny, pervert universe.\\
206 - It was just so strange.\\
207 - I mean, usually he just sticks
to, like, two or three key moves.\\
208 - You know, I bet it's because of\\
209 - that nudie flick
they saw yesterday.\\
210 - They went to an X-rated movie?\\
211 - Didn't Eric tell you?\\
212 - No.\\
213 - God, why would Eric
go see something like that?\\
214 - I mean,
is our sex life so boring\\
215 - that he has to sneak around
and watch other people do it?\\
216 - Donna, of course it is.\\
217 - It's okay.\\
218 - So...\\
219 - What's going on here?\\
220 - Packing a picnic lunch
for your next African safari?\\
221 - No, I thought I'd make
my strudel for the boys.\\
222 - It feels nice having
people to cook for.\\
223 - Well...\\
224 - Sounds like your...\\
225 - ...jet-set life gets
pretty lonely, huh?\\
226 - Oh, no, I have lots of friends.\\
227 - Oh, right, right.\\
228 - But all the friends in the world\\
229 - don't make up for
having to come home\\
230 - from the Bahamas
to an empty house, do they?\\
231 - I actually enjoy my privacy.\\
232 - Privacy, loneliness.
It's a fine line, isn't it?\\
233 - Okay, Kitty, is something wrong?\\
234 - Yeah, something is wrong.
Why are you here?\\
235 - Because I missed you.\\
236 - And I wanted you to see
that I'm finally okay.\\
237 - Okay or better than me?\\
238 - Better than you?\\
239 - Oh, Kitty, you're my
sister... Okay. Fine!\\
240 - I'm finally a success,
and I wanted\\
241 - to come back and
rub your face in it.\\
242 - And I did, and I liked it!\\
243 - Well, good for you.\\
244 - It must have been hard
living in my shadow\\
245 - because I was
popular and you weren't.\\
246 - And I had a life and you
didn't. That's right. I said it.\\
247 - You heard me. You
were a schlub. A schlub!\\
248 - I am so sorry.\\
249 - I'm sorry, too.\\
250 - I just... I don't know
what is the matter with me.\\
251 - I know.\\
252 - I should be just thrilled\\
253 - that you're finally on your
feet, and instead, I'm just...\\
254 - I'm acting like
a jealous little ninny.\\
255 - Kitty, would you
like a makeover?\\
256 - I really would.\\
257 - Okay.\\
258 - I won't look like a whore,
will I?\\
259 - No, no, I promise.\\
260 - Okay, Jackie.\\
261 - There are some things that
I haven't been honest about\\
262 - that I feel like
you should know.\\
263 - Okay.\\
264 - Why are they here?\\
265 - Well, Hyde helpfully pointed out\\
266 - that it's not really honesty\\
267 - unless your friends
are allowed to watch.\\
268 - So, anyway, I made a list.\\
269 - The list was my idea.\\
270 - Thank you for that, Hyde.\\
271 - Okay, so let's just get started.\\
272 - That picture you saw of me
in kindergarten?\\
273 - Those weren't puffy pants.
It was a big boy diaper.\\
274 - That time you came out of the shower,
and you thought you saw a flash?\\
275 - I did take your picture.\\
276 - This one time you asked me if
you had anything in your teeth?\\
277 - And you did, but I said no,
'cause it's funnier that way.\\
278 - When we were
about to fool around,\\
279 - and I said that
I washed my hands?\\
280 - But really I just got done
playing with, like, six dogs.\\
281 - But that's not as bad as...\\
282 - Okay, Michael, stop!\\
283 - Okay, Michael, I think we need
to work on selective honesty.\\
284 - Yes, that and basic hygiene.\\
285 - Seriously, good God, man.\\
286 - Okay, Michael...\\
287 - Unless one of your secrets
involves kissing a girl...\\
288 - I don't need to know about it.\\
289 - Okay. All right.\\
290 - Oh, science fact.
Dogs are cleaner than humans.\\
291 - You poor pink bastard.\\
292 - Well, well!\\
293 - What have we here?\\
294 - All right. I got 20 minutes
till my wife comes back\\
295 - so pucker up.\\
296 - Okay, you two lovebirds.\\
297 - I'm off.\\
298 - Bye-bye, Red.\\
299 - Paula, thank you so much.\\
300 - Kitty, what are sisters for,
huh?\\
301 - I'll talk to you
in a couple of days.\\
302 - And you remember what I said.\\
303 - So what's with all the French?\\
304 - Did she call me something?\\
305 - No. She said, "Search for life to
live life," which is my new motto.\\
306 - Paula made me see
that I have been in a rut.\\
307 - But the good news is,
from now on,\\
308 - I am just going to explore life.\\
309 - But you're...\\
310 - You're all pretty now
with your big red lips.\\
311 - Isn't that enough?
Oh...\\
312 - I love you, Red Forman.\\
313 - And no.\\
314 - All right, fine.\\
315 - But if you paint my
car pink, it's over.\\
316 - Hey, I was just looking at...
Hey!\\
317 - Okay, where did you
get the idea to...\\
318 - Do what you did?\\
319 - I went to see this movie...\\
320 - And it was a...\\
321 - Well, I guess you
could call it an art film.\\
322 - Eric!\\
323 - Okay, fine, Donna.
It was an X-rated film.\\
324 - And it just... There
were all these people\\
325 - and they were doing all these
things that we've never done.\\
326 - And it seemed like
they really enjoyed\\
327 - doing this one thing especially.\\
328 - And I just thought,
you know, who would\\
329 - enjoy doing that
one thing especially?\\
330 - My lady.\\
331 - Eric, listen to me\\
332 - because this is
gosh-darn important.\\
333 - You don't do that,
not without asking.\\
334 - So, if I had asked...\\
335 - The answer's still no!\\
336 - Eric, are you bored
with our sex life?\\
337 - Oh, God, no.
Just the opposite.\\
338 - I figured that
you had to be bored.\\
339 - And it was our 100th time, and I
just wanted to do something special.\\
340 - Oh, my God, you count?\\
341 - No.\\
342 - My God, that's so sweet.\\
343 - But do me a favor.\\
344 - Next time you're gonna
do something weird,\\
345 - give me a little more warning,
so I can brace myself.\\
346 - Or tell you to
back the hell off.\\
347 - Right.\\
348 - Because no matter
how much I love you\\
349 - that was unpleasant.\\
350 - I'm sorry, you guys. I can't
hang out. I gotta go meet Jackie.\\
351 - Don't look at me like that.\\
352 - All right, five more minutes,
but that is it.\\
353 - Come on. Who wants
to show me their belly, huh?\\
354 - Come on. Come here, buddy!\\
355 - Come here, baby.
Who's my little baby, huh?\\
356 - Who's my little baby?
\subsection {Episode 20: Holy Craps}
1 - So, everyone enjoying dinner?\\
2 - - Mmm.
- Absolutely.\\
3 - Good.\\
4 - Now, I want to talk to everyone about
helping me with the church fundraiser.\\
5 - Freeze!\\
6 - Okay, so...\\
7 - God's Magic Circle is our
church's women's auxiliary,\\
8 - and I volunteered to help
organize their next fundraiser.\\
9 - And bravo, I say. Bravo.\\
10 - Now, if you'll please excuse
me, I have to attend a meeting.\\
11 - It's, uh...
It's very important, so...\\
12 - Okay.\\
13 - Now, as you all know, I'm
stuck in a rut.\\
14 - And, I'd really...
I... I...\\
15 - I just need to get out of the
house and experience new things.\\
16 - - But, Mom,
I think you should...
- And I want your support,\\
17 - which, by the way,
I always give you.\\
18 - Mr. "I want to be
a jazz guitarist."\\
19 - Eric, if your mother wants you,\\
20 - and Archie and Jughead
here to help her,\\
21 - then you're going to help her.\\
22 - - You're Jughead.
- You're Jughead.\\
23 - You're so Jughead,
it's not even debatable.\\
24 - You are so... Uh!\\
25 - Steven, stop hitting Jughead.\\
26 - - See?
- Hey.\\
27 - This is important to her, and
we should support her for this.\\
28 - So, you guys will help out.\\
29 - Well, thank you, Red.
And you're coming, too.\\
30 - Oh, no, Kitty.
I, uh... I have a meeting.\\
31 - With you, at church.\\
32 - - Nice save, Dad.
- Shut up.\\
33 - Hanging out\\
34 - Down the street\\
35 - The same old thing\\
36 - We did last week\\
37 - Not a thing to do\\
38 - But talk to you\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
42 - No, see, Fez, Bazooka
Joe wanted to see time fly\\
43 - so Mort threw
the clock out the window.\\
44 - So time flew. Get it?\\
45 - Did the clock break?\\
46 - I don't know.
That's not really the point.\\
47 - It's still a pretty big
waste of a clock.\\
48 - Okay. Well, I gotta go.\\
49 - - See you later, sweetie.
- See you.\\
50 - You guys are such a cute couple.\\
51 - Yeah, I know.
I really like Caroline.\\
52 - Me, too. She's nice.\\
53 - For a psycho.\\
54 - Hyde, take that back.\\
55 - Psycho.\\
56 - You are a gifted mime.\\
57 - But that hurts.\\
58 - Hyde, Caroline's not a psycho.
You just don't get women.\\
59 - We have emotions. We're
ruled by the moon and the tides.\\
60 - And pretty clothes.\\
61 - Yeah, we should
hang out with her.\\
62 - You know, make her feel welcome.\\
63 - Yeah, you can never have
too many friends.\\
64 - Sometimes you feel like a nut,
sometimes you don't.\\
65 - Hey, you guys,
you know who was crazy?\\
66 - This camp counselor I once had,\\
67 - who used to make everyone do
turbo sit-ups.\\
68 - But he'd put a towel
over your face\\
69 - and then when you
went to do the sit-up...\\
70 - He'd pull the towel away, and
you'd have to put your face in his butt.\\
71 - Donna, you stole the funny part.\\
72 - Well, Eric, I've heard it,
like, eight times.\\
73 - Okay, I'm sorry.
Tell the story again.\\
74 - I'll laugh.\\
75 - - But it'll be fake,
though, right?
- Oh, yeah.\\
76 - Okay, guys, I once had
this camp counselor...\\
77 - Oh, my God, you guys. The
Petersons just got a new dog.\\
78 - Let's go!\\
79 - Okay, now, I have work
assignments for everyone.\\
80 - Red, you're
selling raffle tickets.\\
81 - I'm your man.\\
82 - And don't yell at the customers.\\
83 - I'm kind of your man.\\
84 - And smile.\\
85 - You need another man.\\
86 - Okay, Michael, Steven,
you're in charge of bingo.\\
87 - And, Eric, I thought you could
run the cakewalk.\\
88 - Sure. What's cakewalk?\\
89 - It's cake and walking.\\
90 - What are you on, dope?\\
91 - So, Pastor Dave,
what do you think?\\
92 - Gosh, Kitty, I'm impressed.\\
93 - I can't remember the last time
a God's Magic Circle fundraiser\\
94 - looked so gosh darn wonderful.\\
95 - Hi, gang.\\
96 - Hi, Pastor Dave.\\
97 - Say, God's Magic Circle.\\
98 - That sounds like an Eric
Clapton song, doesn't it, kids?\\
99 - Yes, Pastor Dave.\\
100 - Rock on, kids.\\
101 - Rock on, Pastor Dave.\\
102 - Oh, come on, string bean.
Will you stop the record already?\\
103 - Hey, I'm in charge. I'll stop
it when I'm good and ready.\\
104 - And that's not because of you.
It's just 'cause I was ready.\\
105 - Okay, congratulations, Ed.\\
106 - You win a chocolate cake.\\
107 - But I'm allergic to chocolate.\\
108 - Then why are you
in the cakewalk, Ed?\\
109 - I thought this was the line
for the bathroom.\\
110 - Now, don't you screw this up,
I want that marmalade cake.\\
111 - Sure, all right, pumpkin. I was
just talking to this guy over here...\\
112 - Oh, just forget it. You're gonna
screw it up. You always do.\\
113 - Just go stand over there.\\
114 - All right, my turtle dove.
Right over here.\\
115 - For the love of God,
let my wife win the cake.\\
116 - Well, it's in the hands
of the Lord now, sir.\\
117 - Okay, everyone, get ready for
another exciting round of cakewalk.\\
118 - Would you believe
she was once the sweetest,\\
119 - most beautiful girl
in high school?\\
120 - Of course she was.\\
121 - A word of advice, kid.\\
122 - Never marry your
high-school sweetheart.\\
123 - Why not?\\
124 - That's it, Glen. Just keep
slouching. You're not mousy enough.\\
125 - That's why.\\
126 - - Hot as a pistol!
- Well done!\\
127 - Boy, did I take
these jerks to the cleaners.\\
128 - Hey! That's a craps table.\\
129 - Yep. Except here,
it's called "cripes."\\
130 - Would you like to be
the next holy roller?\\
131 - Are you kidding?\\
132 - Next to prayer, craps is my
favorite thing about church.\\
133 - Well, enjoy yourself.\\
134 - I gotta go check out
the Last Supper bake sale.\\
135 - Free cupcakes for anyone
who doesn't deny the Lord!\\
136 - We gotta win
the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.\\
137 - I mean, these are the most
technologically advanced\\
138 - of all the plastic,
spring-loaded boxing robots.\\
139 - Who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky.\\
140 - Or we could cheat.\\
141 - Kelso, man,
you're willing to cheat?\\
142 - Here in the house of the Lord?\\
143 - You're coming along nicely.\\
144 - Yeah, I mean, it's not that bad.\\
145 - Because, technically, we're
only in the basement of the Lord.\\
146 - And I'll bet he
never comes down here.\\
147 - Yeah, good point.\\
148 - Plus, what old lady wants
Rock'em Sock'em Robots,\\
149 - or a box of Pop Rocks
or a SuperBall?\\
150 - Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
they could hurt themselves.\\
151 - You give the elderly Pop Rocks,\\
152 - and they could get
all foamy and stroke out.\\
153 - - So we're helping.
- We're helping.\\
154 - B-7.\\
155 - Bingo!
Gosh, that's lucky.\\
156 - That's Donna.\\
157 - Oh, look at that.
A carrot-top, huh?\\
158 - Hey, that's great, kid.
Just great.\\
159 - You know, I was a lot like you.\\
160 - A milky-white loser
with a cheap haircut\\
161 - and less muscle tone
than a canned ham.\\
162 - Okay, first of all, Glen...\\
163 - I'm wiry, okay?\\
164 - Yeah, I was dating the
hottest looking girl in school.\\
165 - Thought I had it made.\\
166 - So, what happened?\\
167 - I don't know, really.\\
168 - One day we just realized that
she had heard all of my stories\\
169 - and I had heard
all of her stories\\
170 - and, well, that's when she stopped
being nice and started eating.\\
171 - Oh, God, Donna eats.\\
172 - Better watch it there, kid.
It starts small.\\
173 - A few wise-ass comments,\\
174 - and then they're putting you
down in front of your friends.\\
175 - Donna, you stole the funny part.\\
176 - Well, Eric, I've heard it,
like, eight times.\\
177 - Then before you know it,
you're praying for death.\\
178 - Either hers or yours.\\
179 - Either way, at least it's quiet.\\
180 - You really brought me down, man.\\
181 - Yeah.
Yeah, I do that.\\
182 - You guys are so much fun
to hang out with.\\
183 - We really are.\\
184 - So what does Cosmo say
about me? I'm a Gemini.\\
185 - Um...\\
186 - Okay, "The twins, two people
trapped in one body."\\
187 - So you're like
a split personality.\\
188 - If you ever say that again,
I'll kill you.\\
189 - I'm kidding.\\
190 - You guys, I'm psycho,
remember? Whoo-hoo!\\
191 - Wow, that was...\\
192 - That was really good.\\
193 - I almost wet myself.\\
194 - All right, all right.
Enough small talk.\\
195 - So, is Fez, like,
an amazing kisser?\\
196 - Jackie, don't make me blush.\\
197 - No, she's only asking
because when she kissed him,\\
198 - he did this thing
with his tongue.\\
199 - You kissed Fez?\\
200 - Oh, my God. It was so nothing.
He had this stupid crush on me.\\
201 - Shut up!\\
202 - If either of you ever
touch my boyfriend,\\
203 - I will hunt you down
like animals.\\
204 - Understand?\\
205 - You're kidding, right?\\
206 - "You're kidding, right?"\\
207 - I'll scratch your big,
dumb eyes out! Got it?\\
208 - Oh, my God.\\
209 - I know.
Her nails are beautiful.\\
210 - I just wanted to thank you once again
for doing such a wonderful job, Kitty.\\
211 - Well, I'll tell you,
Pastor Dave,\\
212 - it feels so good to get out of the
house and do something important.\\
213 - You know who else got out of the
house and did something important?\\
214 - Jesus.\\
215 - And lucky for us he did.\\
216 - Are you all right?\\
217 - Well, I ran out of underwear and
I'm wearing my swimsuit, and, uh...\\
218 - I've said too much.\\
219 - Eric?\\
220 - Yeah!\\
221 - I'm the richest man in church!\\
222 - Fellows, these dice like me.\\
223 - Oh, yeah!\\
224 - B-I-N-G-O!\\
225 - And that spells "losers."
Losers.\\
226 - Damn it!\\
227 - Never marry
your high-school sweetheart.\\
228 - Sweetheart. Sweetheart.\\
229 - - Oh, hey,
did I ever tell you...
- Heard it!\\
230 - Okay.\\
231 - Who ate the last donut?\\
232 - I did.\\
233 - Son of a bitch.\\
234 - You ate the first 11!\\
235 - Oh, shut up!\\
236 - No, I won't.
I weigh 80 pounds.\\
237 - Look at you!\\
238 - Do you know why I'm bald?\\
239 - My body is eating its own hair!\\
240 - - Hey!
- Hey!\\
241 - Hey, Diamond Jim, come here.\\
242 - How's the abandoned
raffle going?\\
243 - Kitty, I'm on fire.\\
244 - I just rolled four
hard eights in a row!\\
245 - God is bending the laws
of probability just for me.\\
246 - Hey. We won everything.\\
247 - Yeah, we're just
supernaturally lucky.\\
248 - Hey, Mom, I got some bad,
bad news for you.\\
249 - For every one donut I get,
Donna gets 11.\\
250 - Storm's a-brewing.\\
251 - Eric, how could you leave the
cakewalk? Just look at those people.\\
252 - Kitty, how's everything going?\\
253 - Just great.
Everything's great.\\
254 - You kids buy a raffle ticket?\\
255 - Third prize is
a rock and roll record.\\
256 - John Denver's Greatest Hits.
He fills up your senses.\\
257 - I ask for one day of help,
and this is what I get?\\
258 - Um...\\
259 - Yeah.\\
260 - Oh, wonderful.\\
261 - I started out in...
In God's Magic Circle\\
262 - and ended up in
Satan's evil square.\\
263 - I can't believe any of you can walk
into a church without bursting into flames.\\
264 - Kitty, we're...\\
265 - Okay, you know what?
Just forget it. Just go.\\
266 - And please,
leave your ill-gotten gains.\\
267 - I won them. They're mine.\\
268 - - Hi, Mom. We're sorry.
- Very sorry.\\
269 - - Welcome home.
- I love you so much.\\
270 - Okay, you know what?
Just stop.\\
271 - I'm not mad at you.\\
272 - - You're not?
- No.\\
273 - On my way home, while dreaming
about being married to someone else\\
274 - and having his children,\\
275 - I, um...\\
276 - I realized that
this is all my fault.\\
277 - All right.\\
278 - Hold on. This may be a trap.\\
279 - No. I shouldn't have
forced you to come with me\\
280 - when what I really wanted
was just...\\
281 - Just to do something for myself.\\
282 - Look, Kitty, I'm sorry.\\
283 - And if there's anything that
you wanna do from now on,\\
284 - you should go and do it
if it makes you happy.\\
285 - And we'll support you
by not going with you.\\
286 - Would that be good?\\
287 - Yes. Thank you, Red.\\
288 - Good. You're welcome.\\
289 - Wow. You and Mom.\\
290 - You were fighting,
and then you just made up.\\
291 - And you guys have been married
for, like, a million years.\\
292 - It fills my heart with hope.\\
293 - That's it.
You're going in the army.\\
294 - She was scary.\\
295 - Really scary.\\
296 - Okay, Exorcist scary.\\
297 - Fez, you have to
break up with her.\\
298 - Okay, you two are overreacting.\\
299 - She is a little loony,
but she wouldn't hurt you.\\
300 - - Hey.
- Hello, my sweet girlfriend.\\
301 - We've been over this!\\
302 - Caroline!\\
303 - Touch Fez and die!\\
304 - Stop it!
These are my friends!\\
305 - Oh, really?\\
306 - Did they shoplift $30 worth
of indelible ink markers\\
307 - and write your name
on every inch of their room?\\
308 - Every inch! Did they?\\
309 - Um...\\
310 - Did you guys do that?\\
311 - - No.
- No.\\
312 - Well, there you have it.\\
313 - Um, Caroline,
I have to break up with you.\\
314 - But why?\\
315 - And don't say it's because I'm
crazy. Because I'm not crazy.\\
316 - Oh, no...\\
317 - Oh, no.\\
318 - Of course not. It's
just, um... It's just, um...\\
319 - - Donna and I are in love.
- What?\\
320 - - Oh, my God!
- Ew!\\
321 - Yes, we are freaky
for each other.\\
322 - Please, tell her. Please!\\
323 - What if she tries to kill me?\\
324 - You're a giant.
You can take her.\\
325 - Oh, my God.\\
326 - You're really
breaking up with me?\\
327 - Is that okay?\\
328 - Fez, I just want to say\\
329 - that you will never be as
happy as you were with me!\\
330 - Ever.\\
331 - And until you realize that,
I'll be seeing you.\\
332 - And by "I'll be seeing you," I
mean that I'll be watching you.\\
333 - But you won't know it. Except I
just told you, so you do know it.\\
334 - Anyway, this isn't over!\\
335 - Whew!\\
336 - Sure am glad that's over.\\
337 - One, two, three, go!\\
338 - Oh, damn it.\\
339 - Damn it.\\
340 - All right, mine's broken.
Did...\\
341 - Robots are stupid.
\subsection {Episode 21: Fez Dates Donna}
1 - That is the saddest sound
in the world.\\
2 - No more soda for Fez.\\
3 - And no more money for...\\
4 - Fez, do you need me
to buy you another soda?\\
5 - Oh, Eric, you do not buy soda.\\
6 - You only rent it.\\
7 - You know what I mean.\\
8 - I mean, you pee it out.\\
9 - Yeah, I got it. Go.\\
10 - Well, I have to remember
that phone number.\\
11 - - Hi, Fez!
- Caroline! What are you doing?\\
12 - I knew you'd be in here. I
saw you had the large root beer.\\
13 - Caroline,
you have to leave me alone.\\
14 - But I wanna be with you!\\
15 - But I told you, we're through\\
16 - because I am with Donna.\\
17 - Yes? Remember Donna?\\
18 - Well, you better be, because if
you're not, that means you still love me.\\
19 - And if you still love me, but you're
not with me, I'll make you pay.\\
20 - Well, that would only be
scary if I was lying about Donna and me.\\
21 - Well, if you are lying I'll know,
because I'll be watching you.\\
22 - Go ahead, I'm not afraid.\\
23 - Oh, Eric, I'm afraid.\\
24 - What's wrong?\\
25 - When I broke up with crazy
Caroline, I told her I was dating Donna.\\
26 - But I'm not dating Donna,
you are dating Donna.\\
27 - Hey, could I borrow Donna?\\
28 - Sure.\\
29 - Hanging out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - We're all all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - I don't wanna blink, 'cause I'm afraid
to miss even a second of your cuteness.\\
39 - I know,
it's torture for me, too.\\
40 - I could tear your eyelids off.\\
41 - Let's go, Michael, to a place
where our love is understood.\\
42 - Oh, hey, while you're there,
check out the new monkey house.\\
43 - Ah, it never ends
with those two.\\
44 - "I love you, I love you, I love
you, I..."\\
45 - Guys, it won't last.\\
46 - Look, an object in an unnatural
state must return to its natural state.\\
47 - Thus, Kelso and Jackie
will have a fight any day.\\
48 - Really?\\
49 - It's simple physics.\\
50 - Hey, you guys, you know what?
We should get a pool going.\\
51 - We'll draw days for $5 and if they
fight on your day, you win the pot.\\
52 - The pot?
If that's the prize, I am in.\\
53 - Hey, guys.\\
54 - Hey.\\
55 - Donna, I can't thank you enough
for agreeing to help me with Caroline.\\
56 - Hey, anything for a friend.\\
57 - But if she tries to hurt me,
I'm using you as a shield.\\
58 - Likewise.\\
59 - So, while you're with Fez, looks
like Forman will be living the single life.\\
60 - Oh, yeah, that's right.\\
61 - Oh, now you won't get to take
me to see The Turning Point.\\
62 - The ballerina movie? Oh, no.\\
63 - Need something, Bob?\\
64 - Well, it's a funny thing.\\
65 - The wife and I, we're taking out
a second mortgage on the house.\\
66 - Well, that's not the funny part
'cause we're pretty much destitute.\\
67 - It's a little bit funny, Bob.\\
68 - Anyways, I'm looking
at the deed to the property.\\
69 - And the map shows that I own
a couple feet of your driveway\\
70 - and a little bit of your garage.\\
71 - How'd you like to own a
little bit of my foot in your ass?\\
72 - I wouldn't, to be quite honest.\\
73 - It's free.\\
74 - So, our first date.\\
75 - I guess we're
officially a couple now.\\
76 - A couple of knuckleheads, huh?\\
77 - Oh, I make me laugh.\\
78 - Oh, there she is.\\
79 - Okay. Show time.\\
80 - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\\
81 - So, should I watch\\
82 - a ballerina movie or Get Smart?\\
83 - Get Smart it is.\\
84 - That's right.
I said Get Smart.\\
85 - I'm sorry, Donna. Did you want
the last piece?\\
86 - Well, it's too late.\\
87 - That's right.
I said "too late".\\
88 - Yeah, that was me.
That's right, that was me.\\
89 - Hey, Hyde!
Welcome to the bachelor life.\\
90 - You know, without Donna,\\
91 - I've realized that I can
revert to my natural state.\\
92 - I'm dirty, I'm lazy,\\
93 - and I don't wear pants.\\
94 - - I'm just like you.
- No, no, see,\\
95 - I'm an original, a Warhol.\\
96 - You're just a print.\\
97 - Well, those are some pretty
strong words coming from\\
98 - a guy who's wearing pants.\\
99 - Wait,
this is my favorite part.\\
100 - Oh, yeah, that was me.\\
101 - That's right, that was me!\\
102 - Bob, that's my stuff!\\
103 - You put the hell back my stuff!\\
104 - Sorry, Red, it was in
my part of the garage.\\
105 - What are you talking about?
What is he talking about?\\
106 - Kitty.
Kitty, let me talk to him.\\
107 - Bob, get the hell
out of my garage!\\
108 - Fine.\\
109 - There you go.\\
110 - Hey.\\
111 - Hey, how goes the pool?\\
112 - Great, I sold 15 spots.\\
113 - - I got today. You got tomorrow.
- What?\\
114 - That bites. They're never
gonna last until then.\\
115 - - Who won't last until what?
- What?\\
116 - - Huh?
- Huh?\\
117 - What?\\
118 - Oh. Oh, I, uh...\\
119 - I smashed a couple of toes\\
120 - and I'm waiting to see how
long before the nails fall off.\\
121 - I wanna play.\\
122 - Uh, Michael, you're
a little busy right now.\\
123 - No, but, Jackie, those toenails
could fall off at any minute.\\
124 - Hey, me!\\
125 - I'm sorry, pudding.\\
126 - Wow. All right,
now I feel like pudding.\\
127 - Hey, me, too. Let's go.\\
128 - Well, I believe this is mine,
and thank you all for playing.\\
129 - - What?
- It wasn't a fight.\\
130 - Okay, we'll let Fez decide.
Fez, fight or no?\\
131 - Sorry, Eric. I have to say no.\\
132 - The pool goes on.\\
133 - - But, Fez, I...
- It goes on.\\
134 - Oh, what the hell?
Now I want pudding.\\
135 - I'm with you, brother.
Let's roll.\\
136 - Thank God.
I thought they'd never leave.\\
137 - No, no, don't get
all gussied up for me.\\
138 - I just came by
to make sure you're okay.\\
139 - You know,
not too lonely without me.\\
140 - What, are you kidding me?
I'm having a great time!\\
141 - I feel like I've really learnt
a lot about\\
142 - Eric.\\
143 - Oh. Well, I'm glad
you're having fun.\\
144 - Oh, but what about you?\\
145 - Pretending to be Fez's girlfriend
has to be kind of a drag. Right?\\
146 - No, Fez is great.\\
147 - Last night he took me to play Putt-Putt
and tonight he's taking me on a hayride.\\
148 - Fez is so charming.\\
149 - You know, I can see why
Caroline's stalking him.\\
150 - - You know, I would've
taken you on a hayride...
- Eric. Eric,\\
151 - the important thing is that
you're having a great time\\
152 - and I'm having a great time.\\
153 - So have a great time.\\
154 - No, you have a great time.\\
155 - Oh, I will.\\
156 - Well, I will, too!\\
157 - Eric, I cannot thank you enough
for lending me your girlfriend.\\
158 - It feels so good to be in a
normal, healthy relationship.\\
159 - Fez, it's a fake,
pretend relationship.\\
160 - You say tomato, I say tomato.\\
161 - Fez, "to-mah-to."\\
162 - What?\\
163 - You say "to-mah-to."\\
164 - Why would I say "to-mah-to"?
That's not even a word, dummy.\\
165 - Yeah, I'm sorry.\\
166 - It's okay, Eric. Different
strokes for different strokes.\\
167 - Right.\\
168 - All I know is, if I was married
to a woman like Donna,\\
169 - it would be heavens.\\
170 - Oh, the hijinks
we would get into...\\
171 - Lucy, I'm home!\\
172 - Ricky, is that you?\\
173 - Oh.\\
174 - Lucy, what happened to you?\\
175 - Oh, Ricky, I was making
molasses cookies for your band,\\
176 - and I had an accident!\\
177 - Oh... Oh, Lucy.\\
178 - - Uh-oh.
- Ricky!\\
179 - We're stuck!\\
180 - I'll get it.\\
181 - Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\
182 - Hi, neighbors.\\
183 - Lucy, I brought you that flour
for your cookies.\\
184 - Oh, Ethel, you're a pal.\\
185 - Gee, Fred, would it hurt you
to hug me like that?\\
186 - Well, probably not,\\
187 - but why take the chance?\\
188 - Hey, Fred, we got
a sticky situation here.\\
189 - You wanna help us out?\\
190 - Sure, Rick.\\
191 - Oh, watch it, Fred!\\
192 - Boy, you kids really are stuck.\\
193 - Oh, Lucy.\\
194 - Well, I'm off
to romance our lady.\\
195 - Oh...\\
196 - Hey, Fez, Donna hasn't been...\\
197 - I don't know, you know, like,
mentioning me or anything?\\
198 - No.\\
199 - Well, that... That's okay.\\
200 - That's good, 'cause, you know, I
haven't been talking about her either.\\
201 - Of course, uh, I've been alone,
so I'd just be talking to myself.\\
202 - And that's not normal.\\
203 - Have to be pretty crazy
to talk to myself, wouldn't I?\\
204 - Yes, yes, I would.\\
205 - Okay, I gotta get some pants.\\
206 - Damn.\\
207 - Oh, hey, Kelso, uh,\\
208 - Pam Macy called\\
209 - and she said she had a really great
time making out with you last night.\\
210 - - Michael!
- What? No, no! We did not!\\
211 - Fight, fight, fight!\\
212 - - No fair, man.
- Shut up!\\
213 - My day's almost over!
Now, hurry up and fight!\\
214 - What?\\
215 - Would you watch it!\\
216 - What a klutz! Isn't Kelso a
klutz? I think you should hit him.\\
217 - Steven, why are you
trying to make us fight?\\
218 - 'Cause I've got today
in the pool.\\
219 - Now, come on, Jackie, hit him!\\
220 - Oh, my God, I get it.\\
221 - The pool wasn't
about Steven's toenails.\\
222 - These idiots bet on
when you and I would fight.\\
223 - Kelso, are you gonna
take that, man?\\
224 - She called your friends idiots.\\
225 - You better start
kicking some ass.\\
226 - No, wait.
The pool was about us?\\
227 - Damn,
I wish I had a piece of that.\\
228 - You would wager
against our love?\\
229 - Well... Damn, Jackie, in a lifetime how
often do you have a run at a sure thing?\\
230 - Ow!\\
231 - Game over!\\
232 - What's all the racket?\\
233 - Oh, that's just the sweet
sound of me winning $75.\\
234 - A-ha! Not so fast, cheater.\\
235 - It's two minutes past midnight,\\
236 - which means it's the next day,
which means you lose.\\
237 - - Hah! Serves you right.
- Yeah.\\
238 - Oh, shut up, Michael.\\
239 - Looks like\\
240 - the winner is R.F.
Who's R.F.?\\
241 - I believe this is mine.
Thank you all very much.\\
242 - All right,
hand over my preserves.\\
243 - They were in our garage,
and now they're not.\\
244 - Oh, that's terrible, Kitty.\\
245 - Why don't you sit down and relax
with some toast and homemade jam?\\
246 - Jam?\\
247 - Yeah.
We found it in our garage.\\
248 - It's our garage!\\
249 - And that's my jam!\\
250 - Bon appetit!\\
251 - You know, you two
just don't get it, do you?\\
252 - That jam was on my property.\\
253 - I'll show you the deed.\\
254 - There's my lot, there's yours,\\
255 - there's the property line
right there.\\
256 - Oops.\\
257 - Well, looks like I own
part of your property.\\
258 - I, uh...\\
259 - I will not stand
for this trickery!\\
260 - You get out of my house!\\
261 - No problem.\\
262 - Okay.\\
263 - No one answered the phone
at Eric's house.\\
264 - What could he be doing?\\
265 - Where could he go with no pants?\\
266 - Donna, when we're in public,
you are with me. Eric is dead to you.\\
267 - Excuse me.\\
268 - Pardon me.\\
269 - Move it!\\
270 - Oh, boy, here comes trouble.\\
271 - Caroline.\\
272 - I was just offering my girlfriend,
Donna, a sip from my straw.\\
273 - We don't care about germs\\
274 - because she has had her tongue
in my mouth.\\
275 - Hmm.\\
276 - You know what I think?
I think this is all an act.\\
277 - I don't think
you're really dating.\\
278 - Oh, yeah? Well...\\
279 - Well, maybe this will
convince you.\\
280 - Come on, Donna.
Put some leg into it.\\
281 - Give me a break.\\
282 - If you were really together, you'd have
at least gotten to second base by now.\\
283 - You know,\\
284 - when you are right,
you are right.\\
285 - All right, all right. Enough.\\
286 - Caroline, Fez doesn't like you.\\
287 - Is that true, Fez?\\
288 - Yes.\\
289 - Wow.\\
290 - I guess we really are over.\\
291 - Okay, enjoy your movie.\\
292 - - Sorry.
- Ow. It's okay.\\
293 - Hey, Eric.\\
294 - Looking good.\\
295 - Call me.\\
296 - Eric, what are you doing here?\\
297 - Are you kidding me?
It's The Turning Point.\\
298 - I love ballet movies.
They make you think, you know.\\
299 - How did their feet get so pointy?
That's a mystery I'm determined to solve.\\
300 - - What?
- You miss me.\\
301 - Well...\\
302 - You missed me.\\
303 - I really did.\\
304 - Excuse me.\\
305 - Our date is not over.\\
306 - Now, good day, sir.\\
307 - - But, Fez...
- I said, good day.\\
308 - Fez, I'm not going anywhere.\\
309 - Fine, then good day.\\
310 - - Fez.
- I said, good day!\\
311 - Lucy,
these brownies are wonderful.\\
312 - They make me feel silly.\\
313 - Don't you just love
those dried mint flakes?\\
314 - Someone sold them
to me off the street!\\
315 - Um, I don't think these
are mint flakes. I'm flying!\\
316 - Lucy, you got some
explaining to do!
\subsection {Episode 22: Eric's Drunken Tattoo}
1 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
2 - - What you doing?
- Oh, just writing
in my journal.\\
3 - Like in Star Trek?\\
4 - Captain's Log, Stardate 1978.\\
5 - God, I'm so hot.\\
6 - My beautiful red hair
and giant jugs\\
7 - seem to drive
all life forms wild.\\
8 - Oh, my God, Eric. That's
exactly what I was writing.\\
9 - I'm gonna go make some popcorn
and get some sodas.\\
10 - My beautifully sculpted
hindquarters flounce downstairs to\\
11 - procure nourishment.\\
12 - - Shut up.
- Okay.\\
13 - Eric.\\
14 - Eric.\\
15 - Yes, Donna's journal?\\
16 - I am the book of secrets, Eric.\\
17 - Don't you wanna know what
she really thinks about you?\\
18 - Read me. Read me.\\
19 - You know, I really shouldn't.\\
20 - Suit yourself.\\
21 - But beware!\\
22 - What you learn here
cannot be unlearnt.\\
23 - Okay, do you want me
to read you or not?\\
24 - Sorry.\\
25 - Eric and I went
to second base tonight.\\
26 - He was hilarious.\\
27 - The prom is gonna be magical.\\
28 - I think tonight I'm finally
gonna sleep with Eric.\\
29 - Which is like Woodstock,
but for vans.\\
30 - Anyway, I think I'm finally
gonna sleep with Eric.\\
31 - I love him so much.\\
32 - Tonight, I'm finally
gonna sleep with Eric.\\
33 - Okay, let's just skip
to the last page.\\
34 - I had the weirdest dream
about Eric last night.\\
35 - He was Eric, but he was also
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith,\\
36 - and he looked really
wicked and dangerous.\\
37 - Yeah! Wicked dangerous.\\
38 - Which is so not Eric.\\
39 - Sometimes I wish
he were like that.\\
40 - Quick, put me down.
Someone's coming.\\
41 - Hi. Hello. How are you?\\
42 - I didn't do anything.
You look pretty.\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
52 - Hey.\\
53 - Glad you're back.
I missed you so.\\
54 - - Did you read my journal?
- What journal?\\
55 - You know, my Captain's Log.\\
56 - No. Oh. No.\\
57 - I was just, um...\\
58 - I was, uh, going through
your underwear drawer.\\
59 - Yeah. I know.
That's why I look so guilty.\\
60 - Because I was, like, you know,
taking out your underwear\\
61 - and rubbing it against my skin.\\
62 - I can't stay away from your
underwear. That's my curse.\\
63 - So, anyway, see you tomorrow.\\
64 - Gong him. Gong him. Gong him.\\
65 - Yes!\\
66 - This isn't gonna work, Jackie.\\
67 - What, Michael?\\
68 - This isn't gonna work, Jackie.\\
69 - What? What isn't gonna work?\\
70 - I'm sorry, but you and I...\\
71 - - They're here! They're here!
- What? What?\\
72 - Oh, my God!
Michael, what'd you say?\\
73 - I said, "What?"\\
74 - My x-ray specs are here.\\
75 - According to the ad
in the Richie Rich comic,\\
76 - with these, you can see
through a lady's clothes.\\
77 - Okay, Jackie,
prepare to be ogled.\\
78 - Swindled again.\\
79 - Kitty, where's the Band-Aids?\\
80 - I cut my thumb with a hacksaw.\\
81 - Well, Red, you know
those things are dangerous.\\
82 - Well, I tried cutting
the metal pipe with a flower\\
83 - but it was real slow going.\\
84 - Well...\\
85 - Seeing as how you're being
all snarky anyway,\\
86 - may as well tell you.\\
87 - Pastor Dave is
coming to dinner tonight.\\
88 - Not tonight. There's a Packer
report on tonight.\\
89 - They're doing a tribute
to Vince Lombardi.\\
90 - Red, you know I am trying to
get more involved with the church,\\
91 - so he is coming.\\
92 - But, Kitty, if Pastor Dave comes
over, we'll never get rid of him.\\
93 - He'll just go on and on
about how great God is.\\
94 - Well, he is.\\
95 - He said, "This isn't
going to work, Jackie."\\
96 - What if Michael secretly
wants to break up?\\
97 - I need to get him
to sleep again.\\
98 - What if his unconscious mind knows
something his conscious mind doesn't?\\
99 - Well, let's hope so.\\
100 - Well, at least he's not
as boring as Eric.\\
101 - We're not talking about Eric.
We're talking about Kelso.\\
102 - Untrustworthy, two-timing,\\
103 - sneaks-around-behind-your-back-
and-reads-your-journal Kelso.\\
104 - Okay, Donna, I'm sensing we're not
talking about me and Michael anymore.\\
105 - So, bye.\\
106 - Ow!\\
107 - Don't pinch me, you lumberjack.\\
108 - Jackie, I think Eric
read my private journal.\\
109 - Oh.\\
110 - Is this about the dream where
you wished Eric was Steven Tyler?\\
111 - Hey, do you know
who I really love?\\
112 - - Jesus.
- Well, yes.\\
113 - But I was going to
say Vince Lombardi.\\
114 - - You're a Packer man?
- Are you kidding? I bleed cheese.\\
115 - Well, I'm not sure, but I think there
may be a Packer report on tonight.\\
116 - Red, I think you might be right.\\
117 - And I think it could start
in eight-and-a-half minutes.\\
118 - Well, then what do you say we choke our
dinners down, get our asses on the couch?\\
119 - Amen!\\
120 - Red, can you help me
in the kitchen, please?\\
121 - Right now, please?\\
122 - Red, this night is
not about football.\\
123 - This night is about company.\\
124 - And our company wants to watch
the Packer report.\\
125 - He spends his life
doing the Lord's work.\\
126 - And if you would deny
this holy little man\\
127 - that simple pleasure,\\
128 - well, God have mercy
on your soul.\\
129 - Just can it, Red.
Bring him his food.\\
130 - - You got six minutes.
- I'm eating!\\
131 - Red, where is your Band-Aid?\\
132 - Oh, I don't know.
I had it on a second ago.\\
133 - Must have come off
while I was serving the...\\
134 - Done!\\
135 - Hey, Leo, thanks for
letting us hang out here.\\
136 - I just... I didn't wanna see
Donna after what she wrote.\\
137 - Forman, no one cares.\\
138 - That's true, man.\\
139 - Listen, you guys know I don't
allow alcohol in my house.\\
140 - So you're just gonna have
to drink sake instead.\\
141 - Sake it to me, Leo.\\
142 - Don't start with
the sake jokes, Fez.\\
143 - Oh, put a sake in it.\\
144 - Well, this would be fun
if I wasn't so miserable.\\
145 - Look, Forman,
we're happy to sit here\\
146 - and drink these tiny
allegedly alcoholic drinks.\\
147 - But we don't wanna hear you
bitch about Donna all night.\\
148 - Oh, don't worry, Hyde. I don't
feel like talking about Donna.\\
149 - You see,
the thing about Donna is...\\
150 - Here we go.\\
151 - She acts like
everything's all cool, okay?\\
152 - And then, all of a sudden,\\
153 - I'm no Steven Tyler.\\
154 - Oh, Eric, give it up, for
heaven's sake.\\
155 - You're still the king, man.\\
156 - Man, I thought we were past the phase
where we had to impress each other.\\
157 - You are.\\
158 - Now you're in the she-dumps-you-for-a-biker-
with-a-wicked-tattoo phase.\\
159 - The most entertaining
of all phases.\\
160 - Oh, my God.\\
161 - Oh, my God, Hyde, that's it!\\
162 - A tattoo's dangerous.\\
163 - There's a place next to the liquor
store. I could go get one right now.\\
164 - No way, man.\\
165 - We're not gonna let you go
to some sleazy tattoo parlor\\
166 - and spend money for something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.\\
167 - I'll tattoo you for free, man.\\
168 - I'm pretty sure I used to
do this for a living.\\
169 - How cool am I?\\
170 - A tattoo of my
girlfriend's name.\\
171 - How's that for dangerous?\\
172 - Yeah, I think Debbie's
really gonna like this.\\
173 - Wait, Debbie? No. Donna.\\
174 - Right.\\
175 - Okay, no problem.\\
176 - I can fix it.\\
177 - Fix what?\\
178 - Relax.
Debbie will never notice it.\\
179 - It's Donna.\\
180 - See, now you moved, man.\\
181 - It's okay. I can make that
into a flower.\\
182 - Oh, you know what you
should get? Boobs.\\
183 - Big boobs on your butt.\\
184 - That's classy.\\
185 - Hey, I can turn
the Bs into boobs.\\
186 - Wait, what Bs?\\
187 - Like in "Debbie,"
your girlfriend?\\
188 - It's Donna!\\
189 - Oh, right.\\
190 - Oh, I can fix that.\\
191 - Hey, Jackie.\\
192 - Hey, Michael.
I'm really glad you're here.\\
193 - - Okay. Time to go to sleep.
- Oh, sleep?\\
194 - Whoa, I thought
we were gonna do it.\\
195 - Michael, I invited you over for
a sleepover. Not a do-it-over.\\
196 - Okay? I told you. We're
gonna wait until we're ready.\\
197 - So, uh, go to sleep.\\
198 - No, but, Jackie, I'm not tired.\\
199 - But, you know, I always
get tired right after.\\
200 - Yeah, you don't have
to tell me, Michael.\\
201 - I know.
We'll read out loud. Yeah.\\
202 - I'll be Nancy Drew, and you
could be her pudgy friend Bess.\\
203 - Oh, damn it. I'm always Bess.\\
204 - And then Bart Starr
fakes a handoff to Anderson\\
205 - and finds Dowler in the end
zone for the winning touchdown.\\
206 - Wow, on TV it seemed confusing,
but with peanuts, it's all so clear.\\
207 - Red, um, can I see you in the
kitchen for a minute, please?\\
208 - Yeah, just one second.\\
209 - Now, you go ahead
and set them up again\\
210 - and I'll show you how
the Packers won the Ice Bowl.\\
211 - All right!\\
212 - Okay, Red, don't you think it's
time your little friend went home?\\
213 - Kitty, I'm just being
sociable, like you asked.\\
214 - - Just being a good host.
- Oh, sure.\\
215 - All good hosts
feed their guests Band-Aids.\\
216 - Band-Aid, Kitty.
Don't exaggerate.\\
217 - Oh, my God!\\
218 - Hospital, please.\\
219 - "And Nancy Drew and Bess
left the police station\\
220 - "and went to celebrate the solving
of the crime with hot fudge sundaes."\\
221 - The end.\\
222 - Wow.\\
223 - Nancy's so smart.\\
224 - Read another one.\\
225 - Fine.\\
226 - Okay, Nancy Drew and
the Mysterious Charming Clock.\\
227 - "And they celebrated the
solving of the mystery of the clock\\
228 - "with hot fudge sundaes."\\
229 - The end.\\
230 - Guess we solved the mystery
of why Bess was so pudgy.\\
231 - This isn't going
to work, Jackie.\\
232 - What isn't going to work?\\
233 - I can't sleep with you
staring at me.\\
234 - Walk this way\\
235 - Walk this way\\
236 - Walk this way\\
237 - Walk this way\\
238 - Just gimme a kiss\\
239 - Like this\\
240 - Eric, how did you get so hot?\\
241 - I got a tattoo.\\
242 - Eric's perfect.\\
243 - Oh, yeah.\\
244 - Ow. Ow.\\
245 - Oh, yeah.\\
246 - So, are you telling me
that you fed me a Band-Aid?\\
247 - Well, um, to be honest,\\
248 - Red fed you the Band-Aid.\\
249 - How did this happen?\\
250 - Red, why don't you diagram it
for him with peanuts?\\
251 - Look, Dave, I'm real sorry.\\
252 - I didn't realize how sick
a Band-Aid would make you.\\
253 - Well, thank you for
your belated honesty.\\
254 - But the doctor said I had food
poisoning from an undercooked sausage.\\
255 - Food poisoning?
That's Kitty's department.\\
256 - I have never undercooked
a sausage in my life.\\
257 - I have a system.
It's foolproof.\\
258 - Hey, Kitty, it's okay.\\
259 - We all make mistakes.\\
260 - I...\\
261 - Vince Lombardi is overrated.
That's right. He is overrated.\\
262 - Ignore her. She's hysterical.\\
263 - This isn't going
to work, Jackie.\\
264 - Us, Michael?
Are we not gonna work?\\
265 - No. The car.\\
266 - Jackie, the carburetor's busted.\\
267 - This was all
because of a stupid car?\\
268 - We're gonna have to take
the bus to our wedding.\\
269 - Our wedding?\\
270 - Oh, Michael, that is so sweet.\\
271 - I love you, Michael Kelso.\\
272 - I love you, too, Jackie Onassis.\\
273 - Eric, what the hell?\\
274 - Did you just kick my door?\\
275 - No.\\
276 - But I got a surprise.\\
277 - I got a tattoo.
Guess where? On my butt.\\
278 - Why?\\
279 - Why?\\
280 - Because I'm dangerous, lady.\\
281 - Eric, I want you to be honest with
me, and I promise I won't get mad.\\
282 - Did you read my journal?\\
283 - Um...\\
284 - - Yeah.
- You sneaky little dillhole!\\
285 - No. You know who's sneaky?\\
286 - People who go around writing
their feelings in their journals\\
287 - and not telling their
boyfriends what they feel.\\
288 - So, you know what?
I'm not sorry.\\
289 - I'm so sorry.\\
290 - You wanna know how I feel?
Fine. I'll tell you how I feel.\\
291 - "Today at lunch I was looking
at Eric when he didn't know it,\\
292 - "and I just couldn't believe
how much I love him\\
293 - "and how lucky I am
to be with him."\\
294 - Why couldn't you read that page?\\
295 - Because you came back.\\
296 - Look, Donna.\\
297 - Look, I'm really sorry, but, you
know, it's just, sometimes I get\\
298 - worried, you know? I...\\
299 - Well, you know what?\\
300 - Suck it up.\\
301 - Eric, these are my private thoughts
and I'm allowed to have them.\\
302 - You have to stop trying to be what
you think I want you to be and just, like,\\
303 - be yourself.\\
304 - Okay. I think I'm gonna go.\\
305 - Well, wait.\\
306 - Take off your pants.\\
307 - Really? All right.\\
308 - - No. To show me your tattoo.
- I knew that.\\
309 - - Right. Yeah.
- I knew that.\\
310 - I think you're
really gonna like it.\\
311 - But just don't be mad
if it says "Debbie."\\
312 - Woodstock.\\
313 - It says "Woodstock"?\\
314 - No, it's a picture
of Snoopy's friend, Woodstock.\\
315 - You have a little yellow bird
on your ass.\\
316 - If properly executed,\\
317 - the power sweep is unstoppable.\\
318 - Oh, Red, this is silly.\\
319 - I don't wanna run
this play again.\\
320 - Well, we're gonna run it
until we get it right.\\
321 - Because, if properly executed,\\
322 - the power sweep is unstoppable!\\
323 - - Hut one, hut two...
- Who wants cookies?\\
324 - - I want it.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
\subsection {Episode 23: Canadian Road Trip}
1 - Okay, guys, road trip checklist.\\
2 - Car, check.\\
3 - Okay. We're good.\\
4 - Is there anything about Canada\\
5 - we need to know
before we get there?\\
6 - The beer is stronger,\\
7 - and, as a result,
their women look prettier.\\
8 - Then let's haul ass to Canada!\\
9 - Hey, shh!\\
10 - Fez, if my dad finds out
that we're going to Canada...\\
11 - Uh, for beer,
no less...\\
12 - He's gonna start
killing people. Okay?\\
13 - All right!\\
14 - Canada!\\
15 - Whoo-hoo!
Beer!\\
16 - Kelso, you're not going.\\
17 - What?
Why not?\\
18 - Because this is a risky mission.\\
19 - You tend to screw
these things up.\\
20 - Yo. That is
a damnable lie.\\
21 - Okay.\\
22 - Kelso, remember that time we
were gonna put a flaming bag\\
23 - of dog poop in front of
Principal Pridwell's door\\
24 - and you lit it in the car
on the way over?\\
25 - Yeah. I wanted to see it
all flamey.\\
26 - And then you panicked
and stepped on it?\\
27 - Eric, it was on fire!\\
28 - Okay. You're not going.\\
29 - No, no, no. Fine. I
won't use the air horn,\\
30 - and I'll pay for the gas...\\
31 - And the beer.\\
32 - I can't stay mad at you.
Come on, you big lug.\\
33 - Hey, dudes.\\
34 - Leo, man, what
are you doing here?\\
35 - Sittin'.\\
36 - What are you doing here?\\
37 - We're going to Canada
to buy beer.\\
38 - Cool.\\
39 - I spent some time
up there during 'Nam.\\
40 - Oh. Conscientious
objector, huh?\\
41 - No. I didn't mind.\\
42 - Hey, road trip sounds good, man,\\
43 - but I don't want nothin'
to do with that beer.\\
44 - That stuff will mess
with your mind, man.\\
45 - Okay.
Let's get going.\\
46 - Oh, don't tell me
"Crap Shoes" is comin'.\\
47 - The bag was on fire!\\
48 - Hangin' out\\
49 - Down the street\\
50 - The same old thing\\
51 - We did last week\\
52 - Not a thing to do\\
53 - But talk to you\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
57 - Oh, my God!\\
58 - Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!\\
59 - Donna, Glamourella
Modeling Agency\\
60 - got the pictures I sent in.
They want me to audition.\\
61 - My dream
is finally coming true.\\
62 - I thought your dream was to be
the world's first flying lady scientist.\\
63 - No. No, Donna, that was a
dream I had, not my dream.\\
64 - You're a weird
little girl.\\
65 - Yeah.\\
66 - If I become a model,\\
67 - I wouldn't have to work or
study or think ever again.\\
68 - That's great. I mean, what's
thought done for anyone anyway?\\
69 - Nothing.\\
70 - But modeling has made
people rich and famous.\\
71 - Come on, Donna.\\
72 - We're going to the world
modeling headquarters.\\
73 - It's in Sheboygan.\\
74 - Guess who got a bonus today.\\
75 - Oh, my golly! They gave
you a box full of money.\\
76 - Better.\\
77 - A video cassette recorder.\\
78 - What's video cassette, and
why do we need to record it?\\
79 - It records TV.\\
80 - You know how we don't
get to see Johnny Carson?\\
81 - Well, he's on so gosh darn late.\\
82 - Who can stay up
past 10:30?\\
83 - No one.\\
84 - But now we can record
Johnny while we sleep\\
85 - and then watch it the next day.\\
86 - Oh.\\
87 - And you know how you wanted
to watch the, uh, rerun of Roots?\\
88 - Mmm-hmm.
Well, we can tape it,\\
89 - and then you can watch it
over and over again.\\
90 - Well, I think just watching
it tonight should do the trick.\\
91 - Well, we will watch it
tonight. After we tape it.\\
92 - But if we don't stay up
to watch Carson,\\
93 - why would we stay up
to watch this?\\
94 - Because it's conve... Oh!\\
95 - You just don't
understand technology.\\
96 - No.\\
97 - But I sure know
how to tell time.\\
98 - Wow.
What a view.\\
99 - Just like a postcard.\\
100 - It is so beautiful I could cry.\\
101 - Oh, sure, drinking
looks like fun,\\
102 - and all the "cool kids" do it.\\
103 - But it leads you down a sad,
lonely, confused path, man.\\
104 - You know why they call it beer?\\
105 - No. Why?\\
106 - I'm just curious, man.\\
107 - Guys...\\
108 - Guess how many countries
I've whizzed in.\\
109 - Two.\\
110 - All right.
Let's get going.\\
111 - We're almost at the border,\\
112 - so everyone's got
their IDs, right?\\
113 - Yup.\\
114 - Mmm-hmm.\\
115 - Oh, no.\\
116 - I think I lost my green card.\\
117 - Damn. Fez, where's
the last place you had it?\\
118 - If I knew that, I would have
it now, you son of a bitch.\\
119 - All right, hey, Fez,
take it easy.\\
120 - No, you take it easy.\\
121 - They're gonna throw me
in Canadian jail.\\
122 - Have you seen Midnight Express?\\
123 - Well, it's like that,
but with hockey sticks.\\
124 - Great.
Now we're screwed.\\
125 - Ay, what if I can't breathe?\\
126 - Just take a deep
breath, man...\\
127 - And visualize yourself
breathing.\\
128 - All right. Now, when we get
to the checkpoint,\\
129 - everyone just act cool.\\
130 - And by everyone,
I mean "Mr. Crap Shoes".\\
131 - It was on fire!\\
132 - Wow.\\
133 - Hi. I'm Michelle Ray,\\
134 - president of
Glamourella International.\\
135 - And you must be...\\
136 - I'm Jackie Burkhart.\\
137 - Jackie Burkhart.
Exactly.\\
138 - And you're here for...\\
139 - My audition.\\
140 - Exactly.\\
141 - And you must be...\\
142 - Nah. She doesn't
matter. Okay. Let's start.\\
143 - Okay, let's do it.\\
144 - Mmm-hmm.\\
145 - Uh-huh.\\
146 - Let's see the hair.\\
147 - Well...\\
148 - You are a remarkable
talent.\\
149 - Are those your real teeth?\\
150 - Yeah.
Great.\\
151 - Welcome to the superior
world of modeling.\\
152 - Oh, God! Thank you,
thank you, thank you!\\
153 - Sure. Now...\\
154 - You're going to need to
cover a few costs. Of course.\\
155 - Oh. You know, I left
my checkbook at home.\\
156 - Um, can I come by tomorrow?\\
157 - Oh, tomorrow.\\
158 - No. No. Tomorrow,
I will be in Paris,\\
159 - you know, for the big show.\\
160 - Okay. Then I'll
bring it by tonight.\\
161 - - Good.
- Okay.\\
162 - Okay. Administrative
costs are $200. Uh-huh.\\
163 - And publicity shots are $150.\\
164 - And we're gonna need
beauty supplies...\\
165 - Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.\\
166 - Are you an agent
or a sales lady?\\
167 - Oh, I'm an agent.\\
168 - I represent models
like Cheryl Tiegs.\\
169 - You represent Cheryl Tiegs?\\
170 - No. Models
like Cheryl Tiegs.\\
171 - Red, it's starting.
It's starting.\\
172 - And press "record" and done.\\
173 - We are now recording.\\
174 - Two hours from now,
we'll be watching Roots.\\
175 - Well, I just...\\
176 - I... I just don't see why we can't
watch it now like normal people.\\
177 - Kitty, we have a Betamax.\\
178 - We're better than normal people.\\
179 - So, what do you wanna do
for the next two hours?\\
180 - Watch Roots.\\
181 - Uh-uh.\\
182 - Fine.\\
183 - I'm gonna go make
some instant pudding,\\
184 - and you can't eat it
for two hours.\\
185 - All right. Just act cool.
We got nothing to hide.\\
186 - You got something to hide, eh?\\
187 - No, no. Uh, he said we've got\\
188 - nothing to hide.\\
189 - Well, around here,
we don't make a point\\
190 - of saying we got nothing to hide
if we've really got nothing to hide.\\
191 - Cultural differences. Wow.\\
192 - We're all Americans,
every one of us.\\
193 - All right, move along.\\
194 - Thank you.
Cool.\\
195 - Stop right there.\\
196 - Hey.\\
197 - You found me.\\
198 - You win a beer.\\
199 - See? Beer is evil.\\
200 - I'm not gonna say
I told you so, man,\\
201 - but I will say this.\\
202 - I told you so, man.\\
203 - Beer never hurt anyone,
my friend.\\
204 - You're well within
the legal limit on that.\\
205 - But you're over the limit\\
206 - on foreign kids you can
smuggle out of this country.\\
207 - Well, what is
the legal limit on that?\\
208 - The limit is zero, you hoser.\\
209 - Damn it.\\
210 - Hey, I'd keep a civil tongue
in my head if I were you.\\
211 - We could throw you
in jail right now.\\
212 - We're the Mounties.
We answer to no one.\\
213 - Look, Fez just lost his
green card. We just...\\
214 - We didn't want any trouble.\\
215 - Lost green card?\\
216 - Seems a little convenient, eh?\\
217 - You got us.\\
218 - We're here to take over
your country.\\
219 - I
know, I know it seems funny\\
220 - when you say stuff
like that, but, um, don't.\\
221 - No one leaves until
we get answers, eh?\\
222 - Eh?\\
223 - Eh?\\
224 - What are you doing in Canada?\\
225 - What are you doing in Canada?\\
226 - We're part of an elite
high school terrorist team.\\
227 - Strike Force Wisconsin!\\
228 - Uh, we just came here
to get the beer,\\
229 - and I love Rush.\\
230 - Fly by night!\\
231 - Well, if ham's Canadian bacon,\\
232 - then what the hell
do you call bacon?\\
233 - Me no speaka ze English.\\
234 - What's your business in Canada?\\
235 - What's your business in Canada?\\
236 - What?
Getting beer.\\
237 - Every once in a while, do
you ever get an American nickel\\
238 - in your change?\\
239 - Me no understando.\\
240 - What's your reason
for coming to Canada, eh?\\
241 - What's your rea...\\
242 - Shut up!\\
243 - Yeah, I'm here to nail
Margaret Trudeau.\\
244 - Been there.
Yeah.\\
245 - Done that.\\
246 - Beer.\\
247 - Beer.\\
248 - Beer!\\
249 - Are those snowshoes
hard to walk in?\\
250 - They're tennis rackets,
aren't they?\\
251 - Wee fooby dibby dooby.\\
252 - Wee fooby...\\
253 - Dibby dooby.\\
254 - Wee fooby
dibby dooby.\\
255 - Jackie, can't you see?\\
256 - This woman is just trying
to make money off you.\\
257 - Donna, she deserves her cut.\\
258 - She discovered
"a remarkable talent."\\
259 - Donna, don't hate me
'cause I'm beautiful.\\
260 - Jackie, I pity you
because you're dumb.\\
261 - Administrative fees,
publicity shots?\\
262 - Beauty packages?\\
263 - It's a scam.\\
264 - God, Donna, this is
the most important thing\\
265 - that's ever happened to
me, and you're trying to ruin it.\\
266 - Look, Jackie, I'm sorry...\\
267 - And to think I was gonna
make you my assistant.\\
268 - Our nail-care package
is optional... Mmm-hmm.\\
269 - ...but if you're
really serious...\\
270 - Oh. Oh, I am.\\
271 - I am fully committed
to both fame and fortune.\\
272 - You are going places.\\
273 - That'll be another $200, then.\\
274 - Excellent.\\
275 - Hi. I'm Michelle Ray...
I know.\\
276 - I was just here.\\
277 - Of course you were.\\
278 - I told you to stay in
the car, you dream killer.\\
279 - Jackie, I'm here for you,\\
280 - and, as a matter of fact,\\
281 - I've decided to be a model, too.\\
282 - Oh, Donna, you're
so funny.\\
283 - Now, Donna,\\
284 - you're gonna need $200
for publicity costs,\\
285 - and then there's gonna be
administrative fees. Wait, wait, wait.\\
286 - You didn't even ask her
to shake her hair.\\
287 - Oh, yeah.
Shake your hair.\\
288 - You are a remarkable talent.\\
289 - Wait, wait, wait. What? You
think Donna here can be a model?\\
290 - This is a scam.\\
291 - How dare you soil the pure
and noble art of modeling?\\
292 - I like your passion.\\
293 - Have you ever considered acting?\\
294 - Oh, my God.
That's my dream.\\
295 - Oh, my God. Oh.
We're going.\\
296 - And...\\
297 - Time!\\
298 - Ah...\\
299 - Let's watch Roots.\\
300 - Oh, Red.\\
301 - I'm sleepy.\\
302 - Can we watch it in the morning?\\
303 - But I just taped it.\\
304 - Well, I know, but I
thought the whole point\\
305 - was we can, we can
watch it whenever we want.\\
306 - But I just taped it.\\
307 - Fine.
Let's watch it now!\\
308 - Great.\\
309 - Now I just punch "play,"\\
310 - and voila...\\
311 - Roots.\\
312 - Where's Roots, Red?\\
313 - Oh. That's right. I...\\
314 - I forgot to rewind the tape.\\
315 - The tape.\\
316 - This tape?\\
317 - How do they get the
movie onto the tape\\
318 - when it's way
the heck over here, Red?\\
319 - It's...
It's complicated.\\
320 - Good night, Red!\\
321 - Damn!\\
322 - I should've got the microwave.\\
323 - Thanks for looking out for me.\\
324 - Sure.\\
325 - And I've thought about it,
and you could be a model.\\
326 - Hmm.\\
327 - That's...
That's nice.\\
328 - You guys are in real trouble\\
329 - if you did
what we think you did.\\
330 - What do you think we did?\\
331 - What do you think
we think you did?\\
332 - What do you think we
think you think we did?\\
333 - Something involving
a foreign kid\\
334 - in the back of a car.\\
335 - That much is for sure.\\
336 - And now we're gonna
get some answers.\\
337 - What are you gonna do,
torture us?\\
338 - Yeah. You gonna make us
listen to Anne Murray records?\\
339 - Hey! She's
a wonderful performer.\\
340 - And you're not funny.\\
341 - No, no. I think
what we're gonna do\\
342 - is call your parents.\\
343 - Oh, Red is going to kill you.\\
344 - I mean...\\
345 - Ooby dibby dooby.\\
346 - No! We had
to smuggle Fez.\\
347 - It was the only way for
him to see this great country\\
348 - with its spacious skies and...\\
349 - Fruited waves of plain.\\
350 - And...\\
351 - O Canada\\
352 - Our home
and native land\\
353 - Nice try, kid.\\
354 - True patriot love\\
355 - In all thy sons'
command\\
356 - It's not gonna work.\\
357 - With glowing
hearts we see thee rise\\
358 - The true north
strong as...\\
359 - From far and wide\\
360 - O Canada\\
361 - We stand on guard
for thee\\
362 - God keep our land\\
363 - Glorious and free\\
364 - O Canada\\
365 - We stand on guard
for thee\\
366 - O Canada\\
367 - We stand on guard\\
368 - For thee\\
369 - You sure are good kids.\\
370 - Thanks, man.\\
371 - You know, there must be some way\\
372 - to put this all behind us.\\
373 - We'll give you our beer.\\
374 - Oh, God bless you, son.\\
375 - My green card.\\
376 - I hid it in my right shoe
for safekeeping.\\
377 - I even made up a rhyme
so I would remember.\\
378 - My green card
in my right shoe\\
379 - Something, something
right shoe\\
380 - So, see? It was... It was
just a big misunderstanding.\\
381 - Thank God we got that
cleared up.\\
382 - We're just gonna grab our
beer and head on outta here.\\
383 - Yeah, but you're not
getting your beer back.\\
384 - Now...\\
385 - Leave Canada, please.\\
386 - You leave Canada, please.\\
387 - Get...\\
388 - Filthy hippie.\\
389 - Guys, I have to admit something.\\
390 - I love Anne Murray.\\
391 - She puts me in a mood.\\
392 - So, guys, next time,
instead of going to Canada,\\
393 - let's just stay here and
pretend we're in Canada.\\
394 - So,
how's it going, eh?\\
395 - Hey, you know, if Fonzie ever
played a Mountie on Happy Days,\\
396 - he could go,
"Aaay, eh?"
\subsection {Episode 24: Backstage Pass}
1 - Okay, here comes Kelso.
Oh, this is going to be so good.\\
2 - But plug your nose, because
it's also going to be foul.\\
3 - All right, somebody put
a stink bomb in my backpack!\\
4 - Oh!\\
5 - And when I find out who,
I'm gonna kick some ass!\\
6 - Why must people be cruel?\\
7 - Yeah, because now I gotta go
see Jackie smelling like a skunk.\\
8 - And Jackie hates skunks,
except for Pepe Le Pew.\\
9 - And you gotta admit, for a
skunk he's pretty romantic.\\
10 - Okay, guys, I've got
five stink bombs left.\\
11 - Let's go ruin
someone else's day.\\
12 - Sorry, guys. I'm going to
the movies with Donna.\\
13 - You know, it's like,
we hardly see each other\\
14 - now that she got
that job at the radio station.\\
15 - Yeah, you're the wife
of a famous radio personality.\\
16 - Go bake me a pie, Martha.\\
17 - Oh, my God.\\
18 - Donna's on the radio. She's
doing the farm report right now.\\
19 - And in pork belly news,\\
20 - prices have risen
to nearly 54 cents per pound.\\
21 - Mmm-mmm, bacon!\\
22 - Pork belly prices.
How cute is that?\\
23 - And I'll be back at 3:00, 4:00,
and 5:00 with more updates.\\
24 - Until then, keep on farming.\\
25 - Is that okay? I just added
that. I did hit the button.\\
26 - She's staying late again?\\
27 - Oh, God. How much fast-breaking
pork belly news can there possibly be?\\
28 - That's it.
I'm going down there.\\
29 - Well, that conversation's
going to go badly.\\
30 - How do you know?\\
31 - I put a stink bomb
in his back pocket.\\
32 - You're doing the rest
of the farm reports?\\
33 - Come on, I thought we were
going to the movies.\\
34 - Well,
Janice called in sick, so...\\
35 - Why do you smell like butt?\\
36 - That is none of
your business, okay?\\
37 - Okay, Donna, look.
I think we need to talk.\\
38 - I think this job is
really cutting into your Eric time.\\
39 - My Eric time?\\
40 - And I'm very concerned
about your diminishing Eric time\\
41 - because it directly
affects me, you know?\\
42 - I'm Eric.\\
43 - Hey, thanks for
staying late again, Donna.\\
44 - You know, you might just
turn this into a full-time gig.\\
45 - Hey, I'm her full-time gig.\\
46 - No offense,\\
47 - you stink, dude.\\
48 - Here's those tickets.
Enjoy the show.\\
49 - Tickets?\\
50 - Yeah, I know I've been
working a lot lately\\
51 - and I wanted
to make it up to you.\\
52 - So I got Max to hook us up with
Ted Nugent tickets for everybody!\\
53 - The Motorcity Madman? No way!\\
54 - Oh, my disappointment is melting\\
55 - into a mixture of
excitement and guilt.\\
56 - Great.
That's what I was going for.\\
57 - Hanging out\\
58 - Down the street\\
59 - The same old thing\\
60 - We did last week\\
61 - Not a thing to do\\
62 - But talk to you\\
63 - We're all all right\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
66 - As soon as I saw
that skunk, I knew\\
67 - that I had to capture it
and return it to the zoo,\\
68 - where it could maybe, just maybe\\
69 - fall in love, like you and I.\\
70 - Oh, Michael, that is so sweet.\\
71 - Yeah.\\
72 - That's me, sweet.\\
73 - So, here we are.\\
74 - What to do.\\
75 - What to do.\\
76 - Oh, I know what we could do.
It.\\
77 - No, Michael,
I'm not doing "it" in a car.\\
78 - Now that we're back together,
I want it to be special.\\
79 - I want our second
first time to be magical.\\
80 - I can do magic. Check it out.\\
81 - Michael, I'm serious.\\
82 - Jackie, I just removed a finger!\\
83 - All right. How about this?\\
84 - We'll have a special day,\\
85 - just dedicated to all
the romantic magic you want.\\
86 - That's a great idea.\\
87 - - But you know what
would be even better?
- If we did it right now.\\
88 - No!\\
89 - That instead of one day, we have
a whole week of romantic magic.\\
90 - Well...\\
91 - That would be
seven times longer.\\
92 - And seven times better!\\
93 - And seven times longer. Yay.\\
94 - You know,
our anniversary's coming up.\\
95 - Eighteen years. I can still
remember the first time I saw Midgie.\\
96 - She was the tallest
girl in chemistry class.\\
97 - And Bob was the shortest boy.\\
98 - But what he lacked in height,
he made up for in shortness.\\
99 - Red, remember when we first met?\\
100 - Like it was yesterday.\\
101 - It was 1952
at a USO dance.\\
102 - Me and my buddies
were blowing off steam.\\
103 - And suddenly, I saw her.\\
104 - She was the most
beautiful girl in the joint.\\
105 - Hey, dame. Wanna shake a leg?\\
106 - No, thanks.\\
107 - It wasn't a question.\\
108 - I think it was, mister.\\
109 - Mind if I cut in?\\
110 - This is none of your business,
bell-bottom.\\
111 - I think you could use
a little punch, leatherneck.\\
112 - Oh, you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.\\
113 - Huh?\\
114 - I said you're in big trouble,
Red Forman.\\
115 - You're thinking
of some other girl.\\
116 - That's not how we met at all.\\
117 - Oh.\\
118 - Oh.\\
119 - Uh-oh.\\
120 - Fez, what's in the box?\\
121 - Counterfeit concert T-shirts.\\
122 - Me and Hyde are going to
sell them after the show.\\
123 - Oh, how entrepreneurial of you.\\
124 - Hey, you see, I figure with the
original concert tees going for $15,\\
125 - we sell ours for $10.\\
126 - That turns a $50
investment into $250.\\
127 - Where'd you get the $50?
I thought you were broke.\\
128 - I sneaked it from
your Candyland stash.\\
129 - So if you think about it,
it's all profit.\\
130 - Okay, fine. Can I borrow $50?\\
131 - Hey, you wanna see
what 50 stolen bucks can buy?\\
132 - Fez, it's Ted Nugent.\\
133 - Uh-huh, Tad Nugent.\\
134 - No, man. I'm saying "Ted."\\
135 - I'm saying "Tad" too.\\
136 - No, you're not. It says "Tad."\\
137 - I know it says "Tad." I'm
the one who put it on there.\\
138 - I don't know why we're fighting.
What's the problem here?\\
139 - - Because the shirt says "Tad."
- Exactly.\\
140 - But the "A" should be an "E."\\
141 - That's not how
you spell "Tad."\\
142 - No.
That's how you spell "Ted."\\
143 - Oh.\\
144 - These shirts are useless.
Now Forman's out $50.\\
145 - You know, it's hard enough
trying to remember this\\
146 - without you two staring at me.\\
147 - Hey, I could hypnotize you.\\
148 - I know.\\
149 - You could retrace your steps.
What did you have for breakfast?\\
150 - Oh, hi, Kitty. You know...\\
151 - I was just thinking
about how much I love you.\\
152 - - So, did you remember yet?
- Yes.\\
153 - No.\\
154 - It was November 17,
1953, at a USO dance.\\
155 - I remember because it was the
most important moment of my life.\\
156 - Really, Kitty?\\
157 - Because in November, 1953,\\
158 - I was in Korea.\\
159 - So I'm pretty sure that you
were talking to someone else.\\
160 - Are you sure?\\
161 - Maybe... Maybe you came home
for the weekend.\\
162 - Not from Korea.\\
163 - Oh, great. Now, neither one
of us knows how we met.\\
164 - Well, you better get your
thinking cap on, mister.\\
165 - Thank you, Wisconsin!
Good night!\\
166 - - That was the coolest,
most bitching concert!
- Whoo! That was so cool!\\
167 - All right, let's go try and
sell these stupid T-shirts.\\
168 - God, Michael, this was
the most magical night.\\
169 - You know, during the concert, I
rewrote some of Ted Nugent's songs\\
170 - with your name in it. Okay,
which one do you like better?\\
171 - Cat Scratch Jackie or\\
172 - Jackie Scratch Fever?\\
173 - I love them both!\\
174 - - What do you want to do now?
- Uh...\\
175 - Ooh, we can go around back
and watch the tour buses\\
176 - from behind
the chain-link fence.\\
177 - Great idea.\\
178 - - Hi, kids.
- Hi.\\
179 - - Enjoy the show?
- Are you kidding?\\
180 - I'm deaf.\\
181 - You can say that again, Max.\\
182 - Well, you know,
I'm starting to come down.\\
183 - I mean, I'm getting tired.\\
184 - Why don't you take this?\\
185 - Oh, my God.\\
186 - - A backstage pass.
- Oh, yeah.\\
187 - Oh, too bad
there's only one, huh?\\
188 - I'll be back in
five minutes, I swear.\\
189 - You're going?\\
190 - Well, don't you want me to?\\
191 - Of course, I do.\\
192 - That's why I said,
"Oh, you're going, yay!"\\
193 - You're the best.\\
194 - Yeah, that's...\\
195 - Yeah, that's good.
That's nice for her.\\
196 - You'll never see her again.\\
197 - That's how I lost my first wife.\\
198 - Damn you, Donny Osmond!\\
199 - T-shirts!\\
200 - Get your crappy,
misspelled T-shirts!\\
201 - Can't enjoy the after-party without
your crappy, misspelled T-shirts!\\
202 - I rue the day I took you under
my wing, my foreign friend.\\
203 - I'm sorry you feel
that way, Hyde.\\
204 - But I think that the time
we spended together\\
205 - has taught us each
a little bit about\\
206 - tolerance, humanity,\\
207 - friendship.\\
208 - Whatever.\\
209 - Ew!\\
210 - Michael, someone blew chunks.\\
211 - May I escort you
across the vomit, my lady?\\
212 - Why, thank you, good sir.\\
213 - I hate them.\\
214 - You just bought yourself a
barfy Todd Nugent T-shirt, mister.\\
215 - Fez.\\
216 - It's Ted!\\
217 - Hey, who ordered the redhead?\\
218 - Oh, my God,
you're looking at me.\\
219 - Ted Nugent is looking at me.\\
220 - Oh, my God, stop looking at me.\\
221 - I'm Donna.
I am, like, your biggest fan.\\
222 - Oh, hi, Donna.
Meet the other groupies.\\
223 - This is Blonde Girl,
the Other Blonde Girl.\\
224 - Tall Girl,
and the Tall Blonde Girl.\\
225 - Well, actually, I'm not a
groupie. I mean, I love you, but...\\
226 - I work at a rock radio
station. WFPP, "The Sound."\\
227 - I do the farm report. It's like
a huge day for pork bellies.\\
228 - You don't care. Sorry.\\
229 - Well, you work for
a radio station?\\
230 - You wanna do
an interview or something?\\
231 - Oh, my God.
An interview would be amazing.\\
232 - Do you have a piece of paper,
one of those...\\
233 - - Pens.
- Pens! Exactly!\\
234 - You are the best.\\
235 - Okay, first question.
Um, uh...\\
236 - Oh, my God.
Why are you so great?\\
237 - Hey, guys, have you seen Donna?\\
238 - Look, Forman, no offense.\\
239 - We got more important things
to worry about here.\\
240 - Right.
Good luck in jail, guys.\\
241 - You know,
I had a dream like this once.\\
242 - Only I was handcuffed
to Cheryl Tiegs.\\
243 - And you weren't
wearing your sunglasses.\\
244 - It's not just tonight, you know?\\
245 - Yeah, she's been blowing
me off more and more.\\
246 - And she thinks I'll take it,
but I won't. Uh-uh.\\
247 - Can you lift your feet, please?\\
248 - Sorry.\\
249 - And I'm not listening
to your little story,\\
250 - so you really need to stop
talking to yourself.\\
251 - What is wrong with you people?
Come on, that was great!\\
252 - What are you, on dope?\\
253 - Well, I better go.
My boyfriend's waiting.\\
254 - Thank you so much
for the interview, Ted.\\
255 - You're very welcome. You wanna stick
around? I'll let you touch the guitar.\\
256 - Really?\\
257 - All right.\\
258 - Wait, you mean
your guitar-guitar, right?\\
259 - - Yeah.
- All right.\\
260 - Michael, I have to say, this has
really been a magically romantic day.\\
261 - Actually, it's after midnight.\\
262 - So, it is now officially day two\\
263 - of magical romance week.\\
264 - Ta-da.\\
265 - Oh, Michael.\\
266 - And I've got some great stuff
planned for the rest of the week.\\
267 - We're gonna have a picnic,
and I'm gonna cook for you.\\
268 - Oh, and we're gonna go
for a ride on a rickshaw.\\
269 - You know what? You are the
most romantic man in Point Place.\\
270 - Yep.\\
271 - You know, at first,
I thought this was gonna suck.\\
272 - But, you know
I've really gotten into it.\\
273 - And I'm glad that we're
waiting seven days to do it.\\
274 - God, Michael,
you really have changed.\\
275 - You're so different.\\
276 - And we're different.\\
277 - Okay. Let's do it.\\
278 - - Now.
- Whoa. I thought you didn't
wanna do it in a car.\\
279 - No, Michael, you're so
irresistible, I can't wait.\\
280 - What about
the rest of the week?\\
281 - I mean, I rented a tux
and patent leather shoes.\\
282 - Okay, you guys, come on. Open
up. I've had a really bad night.\\
283 - We need the car, Eric.\\
284 - We're gonna do it,
and it's gonna be magical.\\
285 - Oh, Red, it's killing me
that I can't remember.\\
286 - Huh?\\
287 - Oh, yeah, yeah. Me, too.\\
288 - But I'll tell you
one thing I remember.\\
289 - I remember that
you loved Manhattans.\\
290 - Oh, that's right.
That's what I used to drink.\\
291 - Oh, I haven't had
a Manhattan in 20 years.\\
292 - Oh, boy, that takes me back.\\
293 - Oh.\\
294 - Oh.\\
295 - Keep them coming.\\
296 - Oh, my.
I'm as loose as a goose.\\
297 - Okay, let's do it.\\
298 - Upsy-daisy.
I need to use the ladies'.\\
299 - You all right?\\
300 - I bumped into your
butt and fell down!\\
301 - Sorry. My pants were...\\
302 - Hi. I'm Red Forman.\\
303 - How do you do, Red Forman?
I'm Kitty Sigurdson.\\
304 - You bumped into my butt and
fell down and that's how we met?\\
305 - I'm afraid so.\\
306 - Well, what do you say
if Eric ever asks,\\
307 - we go with the "I punched
out a marine" story?\\
308 - And I wasn't drinking,
I was reading to the blind.\\
309 - Sounds good.\\
310 - Oh, my God, Eric.
I have so much to tell you.\\
311 - I actually met Ted Nugent
and I got an interview,\\
312 - and I know I said
I'd be right back, but...\\
313 - It was so exciting.\\
314 - Oh. Yeah, my night, too.\\
315 - I met the janitor.\\
316 - And then I got to see
Kelso take his pants off.\\
317 - Rock and roll!\\
318 - Eric, you're mad at me for going
backstage to meet Ted Nugent?\\
319 - No, no. I'm mad at you
because you ditched me.\\
320 - I didn't ditch you!\\
321 - This was Ted Nugent. This
was a huge opportunity for me.\\
322 - So, come Monday, I don't have
to just talk about the farm report.\\
323 - I can talk about the interview,\\
324 - like an interviewer.\\
325 - Well, you know what, Donna?\\
326 - All I can say is that my mum never
would have bailed on my dad like that.\\
327 - Yeah, I know.
But they're married.\\
328 - Okay.\\
329 - Okay, forget it.\\
330 - Let's just forget it.\\
331 - You're sorry.
Everything's fine.\\
332 - - I never said I was sorry.
- But...\\
333 - ...you are, right?\\
334 - I shouldn't have to be.\\
335 - We are free!
At last, we are free!\\
336 - Yeah.\\
337 - They tried to charge us with
selling counterfeit merchandise.\\
338 - But since Ted Nugent
was misspelled,\\
339 - it wasn't really counterfeit,
it was just stupid.\\
340 - Ah. My ignorance of American
youth culture finally paid off.\\
341 - Hey, Donna,
did you get to meet the Nuge?\\
342 - Yeah, it was awesome. I was
right there with Ted Nugent.\\
343 - The Nuge.\\
344 - So can we go now?\\
345 - Excuse me!
You're ruining the magic!\\
346 - You going to a clown funeral?\\
347 - Shut up. I'm romantic.\\
348 - - Nice rental, Kelso.
- Joke's on you. I bought it.\\
349 - Yeah, that's right. It's mine.\\
350 - - Well, I think you
look handsome, Michael.
- Thank you, Jackie.\\
351 - Hey, Fez,
did you ever pull a rickshaw?\\
352 - - What's a rickshaw?
- Come on. It's fun.
\subsection {Episode 25: The Promise Ring}
1 - Hey, whatcha doin'?\\
2 - Just counting my secret stash.\\
3 - I'm getting something
special for Donna.\\
4 - Something special, huh?
Oh, is it firecrackers?\\
5 - No.\\
6 - No, no, 'cause if it's something
that blows up, I'll go halfsies.\\
7 - It's a promise ring.\\
8 - 'Cause, you know, Donna
and I've been fighting a lot lately.\\
9 - Forman, you get
mushy with Donna,\\
10 - she's gonna see the
secret girl inside the man.\\
11 - Now, trust me, you
don't want to let Erica out.\\
12 - Erica. That's a good burn.\\
13 - You can't do that
with Michael. I'm lucky.\\
14 - Oh, really, Michelle?\\
15 - Oh, I forgot about Michelle.\\
16 - Look, Hyde obviously doesn't
understand mature relationships,\\
17 - but I do.\\
18 - And a promise ring is not
only a gift from the heart,\\
19 - but it also means more sex
and less mouthing off.\\
20 - I'm getting one for Jackie, too.\\
21 - - Great. Let's go.
- All right. See you later, Hyde...\\
22 - ...alicia.\\
23 - What's a good
girlie name for Hyde?\\
24 - Uh... Hydrangea?\\
25 - It's Heidi, you morons. Heidi.\\
26 - Okay, is it me,
or is this not a ring store?\\
27 - Will you trust me?
I know a guy who knows a guy.\\
28 - He'll be here any minute.\\
29 - Hey, dudes.\\
30 - Leo's the guy?\\
31 - Kelso, I thought you knew
a guy who knew a guy.\\
32 - Yeah, I do.\\
33 - But I know Leo.\\
34 - Fine, so you're the guy!\\
35 - So, Leo, you sell promise rings?\\
36 - Promise rings, concert T's...\\
37 - Other stuff.\\
38 - Really?\\
39 - - That's nice.
- Yeah.\\
40 - Okay, we'll take two rings\\
41 - and a misdemeanour's worth
of the other stuff.\\
42 - Hanging out\\
43 - Down the street\\
44 - The same old thing\\
45 - We did last week\\
46 - Not a thing to do\\
47 - But talk to you\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - Ah, the ring of love.\\
52 - Just holding it makes me
feel mellow and content.\\
53 - Actually, that might
not be the ring.\\
54 - Why is everybody
but Fez in love?\\
55 - If I don't get some romance soon,
I'm going to give myself a blister.\\
56 - Well, another blister.\\
57 - Tell you what, Fez.\\
58 - I'm going to take you cruising
for chicks in the El Camino.\\
59 - And I'm gonna let
you buy the gas\\
60 - and buy my dinner,\\
61 - and if we meet a chick,\\
62 - I'm gonna let you walk home.\\
63 - Guys, what if Jackie doesn't
want a ring from a guy like me?\\
64 - I mean, sure, I'm good-looking,
but I can't be trusted.\\
65 - No, you guys are
the perfect couple.\\
66 - You do the bad stuff,
and she tries to catch you.\\
67 - She's Smokey to your Bandit.\\
68 - God, it's like that movie
applies to everything!\\
69 - I just...\\
70 - I wish there was a way
I could give Jackie a thing\\
71 - that wasn't actually the ring.\\
72 - You know, like a test gift
just to see what she would say.\\
73 - And then, if it went bad,
I could just walk away.\\
74 - Hey, am I talking in rhyme?\\
75 - I wish I could
do that all the time.\\
76 - Oh, man!\\
77 - That was fun, huh?
It was a good movie.\\
78 - It was one of those love
movies like you like, huh?\\
79 - And who took you?\\
80 - This guy.\\
81 - Yeah, it was great.\\
82 - You know what else
this guy did for you?\\
83 - Got you a present.\\
84 - "To Donna. Love, this guy."\\
85 - Yeah. That's me.\\
86 - Oh, my God.\\
87 - It's a promise ring.\\
88 - Eric, it's beautiful.\\
89 - I'm so glad you like it.\\
90 - 'Cause, look, even though
things have been a little weird...\\
91 - Oh, look, how cute on the car.\\
92 - Here, look what Eric got me.\\
93 - Oh, my.
Red, go get the camera.\\
94 - - Kitty.
- Mom, I...\\
95 - Go. It's in the drawer
near the cheese grater.\\
96 - Mom, no.\\
97 - Hush. Donna, now, make the face
you made when Eric gave you the ring.\\
98 - Oh, now, see, I don't
think you rolled your eyes.\\
99 - Kitty.\\
100 - I cut myself on
the cheese grater.\\
101 - Oh, now, you get back here
and smile, damn it!\\
102 - Can you believe it?\\
103 - - Isn't it pretty?
- Yeah.\\
104 - I really need to introduce you
to my good friend, nail polish.\\
105 - And a promise ring
is sacred, Donna.\\
106 - Why aren't you wearing it
on your left ring finger?\\
107 - I don't know. 'Cause
I like it on this finger.\\
108 - - What's the difference?
- Donna.\\
109 - If you don't wear your promise
ring on your left ring finger,\\
110 - it totally cancels out the promise
that you'll be together forever.\\
111 - Wait. That's what I promised?\\
112 - Hey, ladies.\\
113 - Oh, nice ring, Donna.\\
114 - Jackie, let me see yours.\\
115 - - I don't have one.
- Oh, no, of course not.\\
116 - Because Kelso has
not given you one yet.\\
117 - I mean, ever. I mean...\\
118 - Look away.\\
119 - Donna, did you hear that?\\
120 - Michael's giving me
a promise ring.\\
121 - - Yeah, that's great.
- I wonder how
he's gonna give it to me.\\
122 - I hope he hides it in food.\\
123 - I told him if he ever gives me
something nice,\\
124 - he should put it in food.\\
125 - It's classy.\\
126 - All right, man, be cool.\\
127 - These chicks
are checking us out.\\
128 - Cool. Got you.\\
129 - Hello, ladies.\\
130 - No, man,
that's not how you do it.\\
131 - You got to be aloof.\\
132 - Did you just call me a "loof"?\\
133 - Because if so, I'll have
to kick you in your 'nads.\\
134 - No, man. Aloof.\\
135 - Distant.\\
136 - Zen.\\
137 - That's not what "loof" means
in my language.\\
138 - Look, I don't care what you think it
means. That's what it means here.\\
139 - You're the loof.\\
140 - - Fez, it's not...
- I said loof!\\
141 - Hey, sweetie.
I got you something.\\
142 - It's a gift.\\
143 - A token of my love.\\
144 - - Do you accept it?
- A sundae?\\
145 - Oh.\\
146 - Yeah.\\
147 - Mmm! This is delicious!\\
148 - Uh, you could...\\
149 - Uh...\\
150 - Uh, you could close
your mouth if you wanted.\\
151 - What the hell, Michael?\\
152 - This is ice cream,
stupid ice cream?\\
153 - No, it's stupid
ice cream of love.\\
154 - Oh, there you are.\\
155 - The movie's about to start.
Come on. Where...\\
156 - Where's your ring?\\
157 - Oh, I put it on a chain so I
could wear it around my neck.\\
158 - Burn!\\
159 - Oh, super burn.
The wedding's off.\\
160 - - Kelso, shut up.
- Kelso, shut up.\\
161 - Yeah, Michael, you don't
know anything about anything.\\
162 - I do, too.\\
163 - Now I don't know
which fight's the funniest.\\
164 - Wait, fight? We're...\\
165 - Okay, I'll be right back.\\
166 - Donna, why aren't you
wearing the ring on your hand?\\
167 - I don't know. I didn't
really think it was a big deal.\\
168 - That is not true. I told you.
I told her it was a big deal.\\
169 - Look, Eric, why don't
we talk about this later?\\
170 - You know, there's not really
anything to talk about,\\
171 - unless you don't
wanna wear the ring.\\
172 - Ouch!\\
173 - Sorry. I'm sorry.\\
174 - It's great. The ring is great.\\
175 - See?\\
176 - - It's great.
- So we're good?\\
177 - Yeah, fine.\\
178 - Okay, good.\\
179 - It's my God-given
right as a mother!\\
180 - Oh, Mrs. Forman,
that is a wonderful picture.\\
181 - You can really see
how unhappy Donna is.\\
182 - Okay, all I know is,\\
183 - when Donna said she was fine,
she didn't seem that fine.\\
184 - Eric has never been good at
knowing when fine isn't fine.\\
185 - It runs in the family.\\
186 - No, it does not.\\
187 - - Fine.
- Okay. Good.\\
188 - I don't know.
She doesn't look that unhappy.\\
189 - She kind of looks like you.\\
190 - I'm unhappy, Bob.\\
191 - I'm just so worried
about Eric and Donna.\\
192 - Oh, fine.\\
193 - Welcome
to Let's Make a Deal.\\
194 - All right, Donna,
which is it going to be?\\
195 - Your future behind Door Number 1,
Door Number 2, or Door Number 3?\\
196 - Oh, my God. I don't know.\\
197 - - Okay.
- Yeah?\\
198 - - Door Number 3.
- Door Number 3. All right.\\
199 - Let's take a look at what you
didn't choose behind Door Number 1.\\
200 - It's a leather jacket and a
typewriter, which you could have used\\
201 - when you became a
globetrotting rock 'n' roll journalist.\\
202 - Wow, that would've been nice.\\
203 - Yeah, too bad.\\
204 - All right, let's take a look at
what was behind Door Number 2.\\
205 - The U.S. Constitution,
which would come in handy\\
206 - when you became
the first woman president.\\
207 - Oh, Monty,
these prizes are bitching.\\
208 - Yeah, truly bitching.\\
209 - Now, let's take a look at what you
did choose behind Door Number 3.\\
210 - It's your boyfriend
and a promise ring.\\
211 - I love you.\\
212 - Hyde, when I cruise a girl,\\
213 - how long do I have to talk to
her before she will French me?\\
214 - That depends on what
kind of girl you're cruising for.\\
215 - Which is why I'm gonna aim low.\\
216 - Real low.\\
217 - Just this side of gross.\\
218 - Where is Michael Kelso?
I want my ring!\\
219 - He's in the toilet.\\
220 - Jackie, wait. Wait.\\
221 - Kelso wants to give you
the ring, but he's scared.\\
222 - - Why is he scared?
- Because you're scary.\\
223 - No, because
Kelso is delicate, sensitive.\\
224 - Girlish even.\\
225 - You cannot push him into this.
You got to be gentle.\\
226 - He'll do it when he's ready.\\
227 - Where's my ring, you idiot?\\
228 - Or yell at him.
It's more fun for us.\\
229 - Look, you, I want my
promise ring, and I want it now.\\
230 - Give it.\\
231 - Really? Okay, just wait,
'cause I just wanna do this right.\\
232 - Jackie...\\
233 - ...from the first minute
that I saw you,\\
234 - I knew that I wanted
to fool around with you.\\
235 - And then, after we did that\\
236 - and I still wanted
to talk to you,\\
237 - I knew that I never wanted
to be without you.\\
238 - So...\\
239 - Will you accept my ring?\\
240 - Yeah. Yeah, Michael, I will.\\
241 - Oh, God.\\
242 - I know.\\
243 - Hey, what's up?\\
244 - - So, how was cruising?
- Unsettling.\\
245 - When a girl's in a car, you can
only see her from the neck up.\\
246 - Talk about
the tip of the iceberg.\\
247 - - So where's Donna?
- Ah, she said
she had to study.\\
248 - Oh.\\
249 - So everything's cool?\\
250 - Okay, look...\\
251 - I don't know what
everyone thinks is going on,\\
252 - but Donna and I
are not only fine,\\
253 - we're great.\\
254 - Everything's
finally settled, so...\\
255 - We're happier than ever.\\
256 - Well, one of you is.\\
257 - What is that supposed to mean?\\
258 - Look, Forman, I get
what you're trying to do.\\
259 - You know, you're trying
to lock her up, seal the deal.\\
260 - And all I'm saying is...\\
261 - Maybe Donna's
not that kind of girl.\\
262 - Okay, you don't know
as much as you think, Hyde.\\
263 - So you need to just shut up.\\
264 - Now, that man is a loof.\\
265 - Hey, what are you
doing out here?\\
266 - Um, I wanted to talk to you.\\
267 - Oh, this is gonna be hard.\\
268 - Um...\\
269 - Eric, I love you.\\
270 - A lot.\\
271 - But I have to give you
your ring back.\\
272 - What? Why?\\
273 - Okay.\\
274 - How do you see
the next 20 years?\\
275 - I don't know.
I guess I always figured\\
276 - we'd go to college together,
then come home...\\
277 - Yeah, but, Eric, you know
that's not what I want.\\
278 - I mean, I've told you that.\\
279 - And who knows, I might
want to go to school back East\\
280 - or maybe in Paris.\\
281 - Okay, well, you know what,
Donna? Whatever. Okay?\\
282 - The important thing is when you
see yourself in Paris or wherever,\\
283 - I'm there, right?\\
284 - Right?\\
285 - I don't know.\\
286 - Not always.\\
287 - I mean, it's not like there's anyone
else, but sometimes I'm by myself.\\
288 - I mean, all I mean is, I don't
know. Neither of us does.\\
289 - And this ring is just a
stupid high-school promise.\\
290 - If we're meant to be together,
then we'll end up together.\\
291 - No.\\
292 - The way we end up together
is by saying we'll be together...\\
293 - And then being together.\\
294 - Eric, come on.\\
295 - We're together now.\\
296 - Isn't that enough?\\
297 - No! I mean...\\
298 - I mean, damn, Donna!\\
299 - If you can see a future
for yourself without me\\
300 - and that doesn't,
like, break your heart,\\
301 - then we're not doing what I
thought we were doing here.\\
302 - And you know what?\\
303 - Maybe we shouldn't even
be together at all.\\
304 - Wait a minute.\\
305 - Are you breaking up with me?\\
306 - Are you giving back that ring?\\
307 - Yes.\\
308 - Then...\\
309 - Yes.\\
310 - Leo, I need to return this.\\
311 - Hey, man, I only said
it was gold, not real gold.\\
312 - No, it's...\\
313 - - Donna and I broke up.
- What?\\
314 - What happened to the love, man?\\
315 - - Well, I don't
really feel like...
- No!\\
316 - If you kids can't
make it, who can?\\
317 - Tell me, who?\\
318 - Why, God, why?

giving back that ring?\\

6 - That first kiss.\\
7 - Okay, well,
I'm gonna call it a day.\\
8 - - Good night.
- Night.\\
9 - By the way, thanks for the ride.\\
10 - God, I wish we'd never kissed.\\
11 - Jeez, what a drama queen!\\
12 - - Who are you?
- Let's go.\\
13 - Go where?\\
14 - Well, you said you wished
that you'd never kissed her.\\
15 - I can show you what would
have happened if you never did.\\
16 - - What are you, like, a genie?
- Genies aren't real.\\
17 - I'm an angel.\\
18 - You're not an angel.\\
19 - You don't even float.
Everyone knows angels float.\\
20 - Fine.\\
21 - Eric Forman,
God's favorite cherub,\\
22 - come with me\\

You and Donna never kissed.\\
32 - Well, thanks. This was nice.\\
33 - - Good night.
- No, no.\\
34 - We're gonna follow her home
and see what happened next.\\
35 - Are you an angel or a stalker?\\
36 - Hey, let me do my job.\\
37 - I'm gonna prove to you that it
is better to have loved and lost,\\
38 - than never to have
loved at all, you pansy.\\
39 - Hanging out\\
40 - Down the street\\
41 - The same old thing\\
42 - We did last week\\
43 - Not a thing to do\\
44 - But talk to you\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - We're all all right\\
47 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
48 - Hyde was waiting for her
that night?\\
49 - I didn't know that.\\
50 - This is my favorite part.\\
51 - - Hi.
- Hey.\\
52 - Thanks.\\
53 - So you with Forman now?\\
54 - I guess not.\\
55 - I mean, he didn't make a
move or anything, so...\\
56 - - Huh.
- Yeah.\\
57 - Hyde, what are you doing?
Get the hell off her!\\
58 - Eric, they can't hear you.
Don't you watch movies?\\
59 - I mean, this is
pretty basic stuff here.\\
60 - Well, Eric,
it's three months later.\\
61 - Donna's with Hyde,
Kelso's with Jackie,\\
62 - and you became...\\
63 - Just watch.\\
64 - Does anyone
want to watch Flipper?\\
65 - Anyone?\\
66 - Eric, I thought I told you
to tar the driveway.\\
67 - Yeah, but I'm hanging out
with my friends.\\
68 - Oh, I'm so sorry.\\
69 - Now get your ass up there
and get to work!\\
70 - You people, out of the basement!\\
71 - Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, Dad.
Don't be mad.\\
72 - This is made-up angel crap.\\
73 - I wouldn't
cave to Red like that.\\
74 - Ah, you've already forgotten
what a wuss you were.\\
75 - See, it was Donna who gave you
the confidence to stand up to Red.\\
76 - Oh, I'm gonna show you
a lot of neat stuff like this.\\
77 - Well, I guess I have no choice.\\
78 - Like everyone doesn't try that.\\
79 - This can't be that bad.\\
80 - - I'm wearing a letter sweater.
- Chess club, loser.\\
81 - Checkmate.\\
82 - Hey, I made the marching band.\\
83 - At last I will be accepted
by the cool kids\\
84 - and not get beat up.\\
85 - Oh, no. Not again, guys.\\
86 - Hey, I got you
a birthday present.\\
87 - - What is it?
- A tattoo.\\
88 - "Question authority." Cool.\\
89 - - I love you, man.
- Prove it.\\
90 - My Donna
would never get a tattoo.\\
91 - No, but Hyde's Donna would.\\
92 - Hi, guys.\\
93 - Oh, hey, Eric.\\
94 - - We didn't see you there.
- Yeah, most people don't.\\
95 - So, do you still live next door?\\
96 - Oh, yeah! You bet.\\
97 - - So, hey, Hyde, how are you?
- Great.\\
98 - My mom split,
so, dropping out of school.\\
99 - Oh, man. Look, Hyde,
you can stay at my house.\\
100 - Then you won't have to drop out.\\
101 - Okay, Mom. Now get one of me
giving her the corsage.\\
102 - Let's roll, twiggy.
My bra is about to snap.\\
103 - - I went to prom
with Big Rhonda?
- Sweet, huh?\\
104 - Real quick, real quick.
Now, Rhoda...\\
105 - It's Rhonda! Rhon-da! God!\\
106 - Rhon-da. I'm so sorry, dear.\\
107 - I told you he'd fall for the first
piece of tail that came along.\\
108 - Okay, okay. Now smile.\\
109 - Big night! Big everything.\\
110 - I'll make you a copy.\\
111 - Yeah, I want to
remember this night. Whoo!\\
112 - Here, Son. You'll need this.\\
113 - Girls like her, they like to
eat before the prom.\\
114 - Good luck, Son.\\
115 - Mmm. Another tattoo.
"Property of Hyde."\\
116 - Classy.\\
117 - What? What's Fez doing?\\
118 - - Step away from that stereo!
- But, Hyde, I got
the new Leo Sayer album.\\
119 - Hey, everybody!
I just made Forman a man.\\
120 - Well, as much of a man
as he'll ever be.\\
121 - Kelso and Pam Macy?\\
122 - But Kelso and Jackie got
back together on prom night.\\
123 - Never happened.\\
124 - I wrote you a love poem, Pam.
It goes like this,\\
125 - "I love your rack,
I'd love to shack"\\
126 - "Up with you and do it too"\\
127 - Oh, Michael. That is so deep.\\
128 - Yeah, I kicked that poem's ass.\\
129 - It's all a domino effect, Eric.\\
130 - You see, Hyde wasn't there
to take Jackie to prom,\\
131 - so she couldn't
make up with Kelso. See?\\
132 - Oh, my God. That's so sad.\\
133 - It's like my relationship with
Donna touched everyone's life.\\
134 - And I was just gonna throw
that...\\
135 - - Okay, you're unpleasant.
- Just give it up.\\
136 - I don't care. None of this
is really that bad anyway.\\
137 - Well, it gets a lot worse.\\
138 - Come on.
We're going into the future.\\
139 - That's right, the '80s.\\
140 - Hey, what the hell was that?\\
141 - Oh, you'll find out.\\
142 - Welcome to 1983,
Donna and Hyde's wedding.\\
143 - Man, did you have to
make her pregnant?\\
144 - Good God, I wish
I could just wake up.\\
145 - Oh, you may never wake up.
This could be a coma dream.\\
146 - Congratulations,
Mr. and Mrs. Steven Hyde,\\
147 - from Cedar Rapids'
number one anchorman.\\
148 - Kelso, man,
glad you could make it.\\
149 - - Hey, man,
can I kiss the bride?
- Sure.\\
150 - Damn it, Kelso!\\
151 - You don't French the bride!\\
152 - Where's the food?\\
153 - - Please, honey,
for the love of God...
- Don't "honey" me.\\
154 - I'm hungry, stick man.\\
155 - Hey, Forman, so when are you and
Big Rhonda gonna tie the knot, huh?\\
156 - I don't know.\\
157 - You know, I'm so busy at Price
Mart, and, she has her dog grooming,\\
158 - and her cheating on me, so...\\
159 - Jackie Burkhart? Is that you?\\
160 - I'm sorry. Do I know you?\\
161 - It's Michael. Kelso?\\
162 - It rings a stupid, little bell.\\
163 - You know, I bet if I wasn't so
happy as a globe-trotting stewardess,\\
164 - I might actually remember the tiny
effect you had on me in high school.\\
165 - - I'm on TV now.
- I've always loved you.\\
166 - Jake, honey, honey.
Be nice to your big brother.\\
167 - He's not strong like you.\\
168 - Brother? What the hell?\\
169 - Well, your parents finally had
the son they always wanted.\\
170 - Now, Son, what do we call Eric?\\
171 - - Dumb ass!
- There's my boy.\\
172 - Oh, what a wonderful wedding.\\
173 - It's so nice
when children get married\\
174 - and move far away
from their parents.\\
175 - Or they don't get married and
stay at home with their mother,\\
176 - who they just couldn't
stand to be away from.\\
177 - Oh, God!\\
178 - Hey, Kelso, man. I just opened
your wedding gift.\\
179 - It's primo. What do you say
we go break it in?\\
180 - All right!\\
181 - You're leaving?
I hate you! Call me.\\
182 - - Fez.
- Good night, Wisconsin!\\
183 - This is really...\\
184 - I've really missed...\\
185 - We have breaking news.\\
186 - I'm toasted.\\
187 - Man, they pay me gobs of money
to talk like that.\\
188 - Fez, do something with your
hair, man. It's making me paranoid.\\
189 - Guys, I have discovered a band
that will change music forever.\\
190 - And I ran\\
191 - I ran so far away\\
192 - I just ran\\
193 - I ran all night and day\\
194 - I love to cook, you know?\\
195 - I'm really good with sauces.\\
196 - Guys, sometimes
when I do the news,\\
197 - I don't wear any pants.\\
198 - You know, there are
some things about Earth\\
199 - I really miss.\\
200 - Okay, welcome to your
10-year high school reunion.\\
201 - All right!
I finally grew a moustache.\\
202 - Actually, it's chocolate cake.\\
203 - What happened to Kelso?\\
204 - Oh, he got fired.\\
205 - Yeah, he thought the news
would be funnier drunk.\\
206 - Now he works for you,
selling water beds.\\
207 - What a loser.\\
208 - - Wait, I sell water beds?
- That's right.\\
209 - Kelso, what are you doing here?\\
210 - You're supposed to lock up
the store tonight.\\
211 - It's our reunion, man. I'll
lock it up tomorrow, I promise.\\
212 - - Hello, Michael.
- Hello, Jackie.\\
213 - Oh, I just want to let you
know that I married Pam Macy.\\
214 - She's one hell of a cook, a super
lady, and I'm really, really happy.\\
215 - Good, 'cause I wouldn't be
with you anyway. You're fat.\\
216 - Okay, Michael. When you're done
being a pig, I'll be in the Le Car.\\
217 - - I'm sorry, Rhonda.
- That's...\\
218 - - Rhonda?
- Yeah.\\
219 - - Oh, my God, Rhonda!
- Hi, Eric.\\
220 - I was hoping you'd be here.
I just wanted to thank you.\\
221 - - Thank me?
- Yes.\\
222 - After you broke up with me, I
was so disgusted with my life.\\
223 - I mean, if someone like you
didn't want to see me then... Whoo!\\
224 - So, thanks to you and Jane
Fonda, I have this new, fabulous body\\
225 - and a successful
aerobics studio.\\
226 - Well, hey, you know what?
I'm glad I could help.\\
227 - Yeah.\\
228 - Rip it up\\
229 - Move down\\
230 - Rip it up\\
231 - Move it down to the ground
Rip it up\\
232 - Cool down\\
233 - Rip it up\\
234 - And get the body
feeling right\\

236 - Everybody have fun\\
237 - Everybody Wang Chung tonight\\
238 - Everybody have fun\\
239 - Everybody have fun\\
240 - Oh, hey! Hi! Hey, Donna.\\
241 - It's Eric Forman from
Point Place High School.\\
242 - Yeah, Eric, I know.
It's our reunion.\\
243 - Right. Good one.\\
244 - So, how are you doing?\\
245 - Um...\\
246 - I was pretty lousy
until I saw how fat Kelso got.\\
247 - It made the drive
from Joliet worth it.\\
248 - Oh, right. I heard
you guys moved. How's Hyde?\\
249 - Hyde's good.
The kids are good.\\
250 - He's gone a lot.
Prison. Whatever.\\
251 - So, Eric, how... How are you?\\
252 - I'm great. I'm the number three
water bed dealer in Wisconsin, so...\\
253 - - Donna, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.\\
254 - You know, don't laugh, but...\\
255 - - Actually, never mind.
- No, no. What?\\
256 - I had a crush on you
in high school.\\
257 - I had a crush on you, too.\\
258 - You know,
I almost kissed you once.\\
259 - What might've been, huh?\\
260 - So are you still writing?\\
261 - Oh, God. Well, I mean,
permission slips.\\
262 - - Three kids, you know.
- Right.\\
263 - Well, you should start again\\
264 - 'cause, you know,
you were really good at it.\\
265 - Well, it's too late for that.\\
266 - It's too late for a lot of...\\
267 - - Hey, so I'll see you, Eric.
- Yeah, I'll see you, Donna.\\
268 - - Okay.
- Okay.\\
269 - Huh? Huh?\\
270 - - Start the waterworks.
- Sorry.\\
271 - - Come on,
you gotta feel something.
- Yeah. Envy.\\
272 - He never had to feel the pain
of losing her.\\
273 - Oh, wait a minute. You actually
had a relationship with Donna?\\
274 - Wait, I thought you said
he couldn't hear me.\\
275 - I'm loose with the rules.
So sue me.\\
276 - No, seriously. You had Donna?\\
277 - Look, we broke up.
You're much better off.\\
278 - Says you! Look at me!
I'm 28 years old.\\
279 - I've only had sex with Big
Rhonda, and all three times,\\
280 - believe me,
she did not look like that!\\
281 - Idiot! You're sad
you were never with Donna?\\
282 - Well, you got off light, man!
I had her and I lost her!\\
283 - And believe me, you don't
want to know how bad that hurts!\\
284 - So, you're an angel, right?\\
285 - Why, yes. Yes, I am.\\
286 - Can you, like...\\
287 - Can you do anything to help me?\\
288 - Listen closely. No.\\
289 - You know, angel, thanks\\
290 - but I've got to go to sleep,
'cause I have a big day of\\
291 - misery ahead of me.\\
292 - Okay, you win.\\
293 - It was better
never to have loved at all.\\
294 - Thank you!\\
295 - And, hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.\\
296 - I'm gonna take it all away.\\
297 - You won't feel a thing,
good or bad.\\
298 - Really? Yes.\\
299 - - Yes, do it.
- Okay.\\
300 - Well, let me just remind you
what you're giving up.\\
301 - Hang on.\\
302 - Wait. No. I want to keep it.\\
303 - Please, just\\
304 - let me keep it.\\
305 - You might want to sing it
note for note\\
306 - Don't worry\\
307 - Be happy\\
308 - In every life
we have some trouble\\
309 - But when you worry,
you make it double\\
310 - Don't worry\\
311 - Be happy\\
312 - Don't worry, be happy now\\
313 - Don't worry\\
314 - Be happy
\subsection {Episode 02: Eric's Depression}
1 - Hey, Mrs. Forman. Hey, Red.\\
2 - Hello, boys.\\
3 - You're up bright
and early this morning.\\
4 - Yeah. We're going to Funland.\\
5 - It's super fun.\\
6 - Oh, Red, remember how we used
to take Eric there when he was little?\\
7 - Remember how I used to get on
the roller coaster with him,\\
8 - and then just before we took off,
I'd jump out and wave goodbye?\\
9 - Boy, did he scream.\\
10 - - Well, it sounds like fun.
- Super fun.\\
11 - And we figured Eric
could use some fun,\\
12 - you know,
since he and Donna broke up.\\
13 - - What?
- Broke up?\\
14 - Yeah,
I heard Donna dumped his ass.\\
15 - That's funny. I heard Eric was
the one who dumped Donna.\\
16 - - Sure, he did.
- I don't think so.\\
17 - Yeah, right.\\
18 - Well, Eric must be just a wreck.\\
19 - Fine. I'll just listen to AM.\\
20 - That's just cruel.\\
21 - Hanging out\\
22 - Down the street\\
23 - The same old thing\\
24 - We did last week\\
25 - Not a thing to do\\
26 - But talk to you\\
27 - We're all all right\\
28 - We're all all right\\
29 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
30 - Come on, Forman.
Get out of bed.\\
31 - Yes, we have to go to Funland
before all the fun is gone.\\
32 - I'm not going.\\
33 - - Jesus.
- Forman, man, snap out of it.\\
34 - So you had one of the hottest
chicks in Point Place and you blew it.\\
35 - Could be worse.\\
36 - No, it couldn't.\\
37 - I mean, Eric, come on,
it's not all bad.\\
38 - I mean, hey, think about Bob
being your father-in-law.\\
39 - That guy would be
in all your wedding pictures.\\
40 - Guys, I don't want
to talk about Donna,\\
41 - and I don't want
to go to Funland.\\
42 - Fine.
If you're not going with us,\\
43 - we'll stay here with you.\\
44 - We're not going to Funland?\\
45 - Don't touch the G.I. Joes.\\
46 - - Hey, Eric, did you...
- Hey, buddy, can we not talk?\\
47 - Thanks.\\
48 - Fine. We're going to Funland.\\
49 - Good. Go.\\
50 - You know what? I'm glad
you are not going to Funland,\\
51 - because you will suck the fun
right out of it.\\
52 - And then it would just be
called "Landland."\\
53 - I'm sorry. I'll get you
a candy apple, okay?\\
54 - Okay, okay, I got Eric out of
bed. He's on his way down.\\
55 - Now remember, don't say
anything about Donna.\\
56 - He'll talk when he's ready.\\
57 - Okay.\\
58 - Gee, Son, you look like
you've just been dumped.\\
59 - I wasn't dumped, okay?\\
60 - We broke up.\\
61 - Yeah, well, run it off.\\
62 - Do you want to
talk about it, honey?\\
63 - - No.
- Okay.\\
64 - - Are you sure?
- Yes.\\
65 - - Yes, I'm sure.
- Okay. Let's not talk.\\
66 - Eric, you are a handsome
young man with a lot to offer.\\
67 - Okay.\\
68 - - Can I go now?
- No, no, no. Not until you eat.\\
69 - You look like you
haven't eaten for a week.\\
70 - Oh, come on, Kitty.
He always looks like that.\\
71 - Well, maybe so.\\
72 - But he won't have the strength to
get over Donna if he doesn't eat.\\
73 - Fine!\\
74 - I'll eat.\\
75 - Just no more
talking about Donna.\\
76 - For one minute,\\
77 - I'd like to not\\
78 - think about Donna.\\
79 - No Donna.\\
80 - Red, you should go talk to him.\\
81 - What? Why me?\\
82 - Well, because I don't really
know how to mend a broken heart.\\
83 - I've never been dumped.\\
84 - Oh, I don't believe that.\\
85 - Why not?\\
86 - Well, there are certain things
about you that are annoying\\
87 - that other people might
not have been as tolerant of.\\
88 - You're bald!\\
89 - See? Like that.\\
90 - Okay, Michael,
now we have to stay together.\\
91 - Every time we come here
you get lost.\\
92 - Damn, Jackie, there's fun
around every corner.\\
93 - Michael, what are the rules?\\
94 - Uh, no hitting you from behind
with the bumper cars.\\
95 - And?\\
96 - And no riding the goats
at the petting zoo.\\
97 - And?\\
98 - We have to stay together,
Michael!\\
99 - Fine!\\
100 - - Balloons!
- Stay!\\
101 - Hey there, kids!
I'm Woofy, the Funland dog,\\
102 - and I'm here to make sure
that you have fun, fun, fun!\\
103 - Touch me like that again, you're gonna eat
your Alpo through a straw, straw, straw.\\
104 - Whoa, okeydokey.\\
105 - Well, I'm going down to the saloon
to look for the guy who shot my paw.\\
106 - Oh, my God. That was Woofy
and he talked to us.\\
107 - Okay, guys, we gotta pick a
place to meet in case we split up.\\
108 - How about the corner of Fun
Street and Fun Boulevard?\\
109 - I mean, that should be easy
enough for even Michael to remember.\\
110 - Michael?\\
111 - Great.
Now we'll never find him.\\
112 - Ah, sure we will.\\
113 - All we have to do is show people
his picture, and they'll help us find him.\\
114 - You have a picture of Kelso
in your wallet?\\
115 - Of course. I carry pictures
of all my friends.\\
116 - You're friends
with Nipsey Russell?\\
117 - I want to be.\\
118 - Now, I know he's in there.
Go talk to him.\\
119 - - I don't want to.
- Fine.\\
120 - But when I broke up
with Archie Wilkins,\\
121 - he lived with his parents
until he was 40.\\
122 - Good God, Kitty.\\
123 - That's another 23 years.\\
124 - All right. I'm going in.\\
125 - Hey, Eric.\\
126 - How you doing?\\
127 - Dad, I'm really not
in the mood for conversation.\\
128 - Good. Then I'll talk,
and you listen.\\
129 - I ever tell you the story about
Larry "No Foot" Mulligan?\\
130 - Well, I can guess.
He had no foot?\\
131 - Larry was a buddy of mine
who lost his foot during the war.\\
132 - And then, on his way
back to the States,\\
133 - old One Foot, at that point
we were calling him "One Foot,"\\
134 - had his ship go down, and
a shark ate his other foot.\\
135 - But he made it
all the way back home.\\
136 - And you know what happened
to him when he got here?\\
137 - He overcame his handicap and,
ironically, became a shoe salesman?\\
138 - No. His girlfriend dumped him.\\
139 - Well, thank God
it had a happy ending.\\
140 - Look, the point of the
story is, you've got both feet.\\
141 - You'll be fine.\\
142 - Now, put some shoes on, go
on down and trim the hedges.\\
143 - Yeah. Well, you know, I think
I'm just gonna stay up here.\\
144 - Yeah. Well, you know,
I think you're not!\\
145 - Hi. Have you seen him?
His name is Kelso.\\
146 - Kelso's trapped in a box?\\
147 - Hey. Fez, check it out.\\
148 - "Fun university."\\
149 - Now check out the back.\\
150 - "FU."\\
151 - I don't get it.\\
152 - FU, man.\\
153 - FU!\\
154 - Oh, right. Fu.\\
155 - That's a good one.
That's a good one.\\
156 - I tried to look for Michael,
but I can't see over the crowd.\\
157 - Oh, I wish Donna was here.
She's a giant.\\
158 - Ah, don't remind me.\\
159 - I asked her and asked her
and asked her to come,\\
160 - and she just kept saying,
"Get out of my bathroom, Fez."\\
161 - Well, we still have to find
Michael. So, what time is it?\\
162 - Did someone ask what time it is?\\
163 - Why, here in Funland,
it's always fun o'clock.\\
164 - -Fun
-Fun\\
165 - -Fun
-Fun\\
166 - It's always fun o'clock
in Funland\\
167 - Yeah, yeah,
thanks a lot, you morons.\\
168 - Hey, you guys wouldn't happen
to know what time it is, would you?\\
169 - It's always fun o'clock
in Funland\\
170 - Oh, yeah!\\
171 - Which means it's
fun o'clock in Funland\\
172 - Rock on!\\
173 - If you don't believe it
We'll tell you once again\\
174 - I thought we were in love,
you know?\\
175 - Oh, God.\\
176 - And then it all
just blows apart.\\
177 - And all that's left is
this big hole, you know?\\
178 - No, I don't.\\
179 - Oh. But there is
a gopher hole out back.\\
180 - And if you shove the hose down
and flush him out,\\
181 - I'll stand at the other end and
hit him in the head with a shovel.\\
182 - Uh-huh.\\
183 - - Just go, Dad.
- Thanks. Thank you.\\
184 - Well, I see sunshine outside,
but I don't see sunshine inside.\\
185 - Wanna talk about the breakup,
Bambi?\\
186 - No, Dad, I don't
want to talk about it.\\
187 - You know, we were happy.\\
188 - But he had to push me.\\
189 - He had to define everything
and get his little ring on me.\\
190 - And by the time it was over, we
weren't even together anymore.\\
191 - I'm fine. Son of a bitch.\\
192 - Listen, when you're done...\\
193 - I know, I know.
Put the bags on the curb.\\
194 - Hey.\\
195 - "Hey"? Is that all
you have to say to me?\\
196 - Well, what do you
have to say to me?\\
197 - Oh.\\
198 - How about this? Hey.\\
199 - - I'm not wrong!
- You are wrong, you dillhole!\\
200 - Oh, great. That's nice. That's
really mature. Double dillhole!\\
201 - "Double dillhole?"\\
202 - Oh, jeez.\\
203 - You were outside.
You were happy.\\
204 - Why are you back in bed?\\
205 - Well, I guess all that
fresh air got me thinking\\
206 - that I'd rather be in bed.\\
207 - Yeah, well, get up.
It's time to go to work.\\
208 - Fine.\\
209 - Oh, and, uh, you don't have
to worry about that gopher.\\
210 - It's as dead as you and Donna.\\
211 - Too soon, huh?\\
212 - I can't believe you two.\\
213 - Poor Michael is lost,\\
214 - and all you've done is
gone on rides and had fun.\\
215 - Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
It's the Funland Princess!\\
216 - The Funland Princess?\\
217 - I haven't been on that ride yet.\\
218 - So, I figure this is the lost
and found, and I lost my friends,\\
219 - so they're bound to
show up here sooner or later.\\
220 - Right?\\
221 - I miss my friends.\\
222 - I miss my friends.\\
223 - - What?
- What?\\
224 - - Stop it.
- Stop it.\\
225 - No. Stop copying me!\\
226 - Stop copying me!\\
227 - - I'm stupid.
- You're stupid.\\
228 - Damn it!\\
229 - Hey, how about that
new cashier at work?\\
230 - Not bad, huh?\\
231 - Single, too.\\
232 - - Dad, I'm not...
- What? Is it the braces?\\
233 - Well, you know what helps
a fellow get over a gal?\\
234 - Pimiento loaf.\\
235 - Fine.\\
236 - What happened here, Red?\\
237 - I thought you
were gonna help him.\\
238 - Kitty, I yelled at him all day.\\
239 - I don't know what else to do.\\
240 - Well, how did you get through
your first breakup?\\
241 - What's to get over?\\
242 - It happened.
I took it like a man.\\
243 - She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.\\
244 - Oh, Eloise.\\
245 - Oh, Eloise!\\
246 - My life is over.\\
247 - Yep.
Took it like a man.\\
248 - That was the House of Mirrors?\\
249 - I have more mirrors
than that in my purse.\\
250 - Why is everyone leaving?\\
251 - Oh, my God. What time is it?\\
252 - Did someone ask what time it is?\\
253 - Yeah, we know.
It's fun o'clock. Get killed.\\
254 - No, it's closing time, kids.
Time for you to go.\\
255 - But... But, Woofy, we still
haven't found our friend.\\
256 - Yeah? Well, golly gee,
that's... That's just too...\\
257 - Come on. Get out.\\
258 - Oh. Except for you!\\
259 - - All right. Let's go.
- Okay, now what about Michael?\\
260 - There's been lost dogs who've
traveled hundreds of miles\\
261 - to be reunited
with their families.\\
262 - Now, Kelso is not
as smart as that,\\
263 - but I'm sure he can make it
the 12 miles back to Forman's.\\
264 - So, me and this girl Eloise
were together for a while.\\
265 - Everything was great.\\
266 - But when things
started getting serious,\\
267 - she dumped me.\\
268 - Man, that...
That hurt like hell.\\
269 - - Did you cry?
- No.\\
270 - No, no.\\
271 - But there were times when I
thought I would never get over it.\\
272 - But time passed.\\
273 - I moved on.\\
274 - And then the day came when I
didn't think about her as much.\\
275 - Then a couple of more days
came along,\\
276 - and, why, I thought
about her even less.\\
277 - Then one day, I didn't
think about her at all.\\
278 - And then that made me sad.\\
279 - We've got a little Irish
in us, don't we, Dad?\\
280 - Yes, we do.\\
281 - It's just...\\
282 - It hurts, you know.\\
283 - Listen, I'm gonna give you a
few days to pull yourself together.\\
284 - You can stay in bed and sleep,\\
285 - watch TV,\\
286 - whatever you need to do.\\
287 - Thank you, Dad.\\
288 - And, you know,
not that it matters,\\
289 - but Donna didn't dump me.\\
290 - I broke up with her.\\
291 - Whatever you need to tell
yourself to make it better.\\
292 - Thanks a lot for the ride,
Mrs. Anderson.\\
293 - Hey, Einstein,
you gonna eat that ice cream?\\
294 - My name's not Einstein.\\
295 - It's Kelso.
And, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.\\
296 - That's it!\\
297 - - Get out!
- They started it.\\
298 - Out!\\
299 - See ya, Einstein.\\
300 - It's not Einstein! It's Kelso!
\subsection {Episode 03: Pinciotti vs. Forman}
1 - Wow! Donna, you look great.
What could it be?\\
2 - Oh, I know! You lost
80 pounds of ugly fat.\\
3 - Burn, Eric, burn!\\
4 - Okay, first of all,
I weigh 130, 140, 149...\\
5 - Pounds.\\
6 - Yeah. You look good too, Eric.\\
7 - You lost your
one true love, so...\\
8 - Looking good.\\
9 - Eric, I found
these records of yours,\\
10 - and I thought you
might want them back.\\
11 - Ah, the unpleasant exchange of
possessions after the horrific break up.\\
12 - Awkward for them,
entertaining for us.\\
13 - Whoa. Shut up.
Don Kirshner's starting.\\
14 - Oh, right. Paul McCartney
and Wings are on tonight.\\
15 - Okay, so...\\
16 - Okay, we're all here now.\\
17 - So, um...\\
18 - - So, Donna, you're staying?
- Okay.\\
19 - What I meant to say was...\\
20 - Look, Donna, I don't think
it's cool if you hang out here.\\
21 - So, what,
you're like, kicking me out?\\
22 - Wow.\\
23 - Okay, then. Bye.\\
24 - Well, if you're kicking her out,\\
25 - then you're kicking me out.\\
26 - No, Jackie, no.\\
27 - Oh, wait. I mean, bye!\\
28 - Hanging out\\
29 - Down the street\\
30 - The same old thing\\
31 - We did last week\\
32 - Not a thing to do\\
33 - But talk to you\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
37 - Well, it's just not fair.\\
38 - He doesn't, like, get my friends\\
39 - 'cause he has some stupid,
crappy basement.\\
40 - Right!\\
41 - You helped make that basement
what it is today.\\
42 - Right.\\
43 - No one would
even go over there before me.\\
44 - It smelled like feet.\\
45 - Donna, you have to fight back.\\
46 - Okay, when a couple splits up,\\
47 - the woman deserves her fair
share of the life she helped build.\\
48 - - How much is that?
- All of it.\\
49 - Donna, it's the law.\\
50 - You know, normally, that
statement would really offend me.\\
51 - But now that I'm single
and pissed,\\
52 - you're making a lot of sense.\\
53 - And then she just comes down
to the basement like it's no big deal.\\
54 - And after what happened?\\
55 - And she's just gonna act like
everything's cool and everything's fine?\\
56 - You don't love me, you don't
get my couch or my friends.\\
57 - I'm a package deal, baby!\\
58 - So, I just told her, "Fire up
those walking sticks, Big Red,\\
59 - "because this ain't happening.
I'm not having it."\\
60 - Hey, Forman,\\
61 - we were all there,\\
62 - and that ain't how it happened.\\
63 - You wanna talk
about it some more?\\
64 - Mmm, no.\\
65 - Hello, Kitty.\\
66 - Oh, Pastor Dave, what a
nice surprise. How's God?\\
67 - Fine, thank you.\\
68 - So, I was wondering if, uh,\\
69 - - Red was home.
- Oh, no. What did he do?\\
70 - No. No, no, nothing.\\
71 - Uh, I just thought
he might like to, uh,\\
72 - I don't know, goof off?\\
73 - You want to spend time with Red.\\
74 - - Unless it's a bad time.
- Oh, no, no, no.\\
75 - This is a great time. Oh,
my God. Red has a visitor.\\
76 - Red, Pastor Dave's here.
For you. Hurry.\\
77 - Oh, yeah.\\
78 - I ran into him in
the hardware store.\\
79 - You know, he was gonna try to
paint his garage, without priming.\\
80 - That crazy bastard.\\
81 - Oh, my. Red has a friend.\\
82 - Psst.\\
83 - What are
you guys doing today?\\
84 - We're going to the basement.\\
85 - Hmm. Sounds fun.\\
86 - But you know what sounds
like even more fun?\\
87 - Oh! Playing with
a bunch of monkeys?\\
88 - Well, yeah.\\
89 - But we got cable TV at my house,\\
90 - which we all know has the
potential for flashes of brief nudity.\\
91 - Nudity.\\
92 - Cable?\\
93 - Oh, you are so
gonna win this breakup!\\
94 - Now, wait just a minute.\\
95 - Eric is our friend, our brother.\\
96 - We cannot just abandon him
for nude boobs.\\
97 - Good point, Fez.\\
98 - This nudity you speak of,
are we talking full frontal?\\
99 - Does it matter?\\
100 - No. Let's go.\\
101 - So, you have no idea
where everyone is?\\
102 - Everyone who?\\
103 - Hey, you got any popsicles?
Donna's all out.\\
104 - Oh, so that's how it is?
Everyone's over at Donna's?\\
105 - Eric, man, I'm sorry.\\
106 - And I know that we've been
friends for, like, a really long time,\\
107 - but, uh, we were watching
Barbarella on cable.\\
108 - Man, and I not only saw boobs,\\
109 - but I saw boobs in space.\\
110 - Yeah, space boobs, Eric!\\
111 - There's no gravity!\\
112 - She got cable?\\
113 - That sneaky little wench.\\
114 - No, no. And corn dogs.\\
115 - Oh, dogs wrapped in corn.\\
116 - Oh, sweetmeat on a stick.\\
117 - Just go.\\
118 - Thank you.\\
119 - "At Dave's.
Back around 5:00. Red."\\
120 - Oh.\\
121 - I hadn't realized before,\\
122 - but the primer is
like your emotions.\\
123 - It's what's
underneath the surface.\\
124 - And the rust is like your anger.\\
125 - Boy, having a male
companion to talk to\\
126 - is changing my life.\\
127 - I wish I could tell Kitty
exactly how I feel about her,\\
128 - but I just can't find the words.\\
129 - I'll help you.
We'll find the words together.\\
130 - Oh, sure,
sometimes I feel like crying,\\
131 - but I just can't.\\
132 - You can with me.\\
133 - - Hey.
- Oh, hello.\\
134 - So, how was your day?\\
135 - What did you
and your new friend do?\\
136 - Well...\\
137 - - Mmm.
- Yeah.\\
138 - - So, that's all you did?
- Yep.\\
139 - - Well, you didn't
talk about anything?
- Nope.\\
140 - Do you hate him?\\
141 - - Kitty, don't start.
- No, no, no, no. No.\\
142 - All I'm saying is, people with
friends live longer.\\
143 - And you are not good
at keeping friends.\\
144 - Bob's scared of you, and Earl
isn't speaking to you.\\
145 - - What about Frank?
- Frank's dead.\\
146 - Exactly.\\
147 - It is time to replace
your dead friend Frank. I win.\\
148 - Oh, look, there's a boob!\\
149 - There's two.\\
150 - Oh, wait, four.\\
151 - It's the mother lode.\\
152 - Oh, man, guy butt. Look away.\\
153 - I feel kind of bad.\\
154 - Hon, it's just guy butt.
It won't hurt you.\\
155 - No! About Eric.\\
156 - I mean, he was totally in
the right to kick Donna out.\\
157 - Oh, he was not right.\\
158 - Now, you agree with me.\\
159 - No.\\
160 - Ow!\\
161 - - Agree with me.
- No!\\
162 - Donna broke his heart, and
now she should have to pay.\\
163 - - Chex Mix?
- Oh, thank you, Donna.\\
164 - Oh, we are so not talking.\\
165 - - All right, Jackie...
- I said, not talking.\\
166 - Well done.\\
167 - - All right, Fez...
- I said, well done.\\
168 - Oh, there are all my friends.\\
169 - Hey, Donna,
I found these socks of yours,\\
170 - so I thought I'd just, you
know, run them right over.\\
171 - Eric, you can't hang out here.\\
172 - It's really uncomfortable, so...\\
173 - Uncomfortable?\\
174 - Who's uncomfortable?\\
175 - Oh, fine.\\
176 - Look, man, I'd go with you,
but, you know, it's cable.\\
177 - Whatever.\\
178 - Hey, hey, want me to come by
later and tell you about the boobs?\\
179 - No!\\
180 - Yeah.\\
181 - It's Dave for you.\\
182 - Yeah. Fine. Right.\\
183 - Okay.\\
184 - Mmm.\\
185 - You do not grunt to a friend.\\
186 - Friends don't grunt.\\
187 - Okay, so I was over
at the Pinciotti's,\\
188 - crouched behind the hedge
next to the house,\\
189 - and I distinctly heard
laughter. Laughter! Well.\\
190 - I will tell you what. I am not
going down without a fight.\\
191 - No, siree, Bob.\\
192 - Bob.\\
193 - The kids really like my jokes?\\
194 - Oh.\\
195 - Mr. Pinciotti, if you
only knew the number of times\\
196 - Donna's shared one of
your doozies with the gang.\\
197 - Lordy, how we laugh and laugh\\
198 - and laugh.\\
199 - - Right. I'm going.
- Okay.\\
200 - But the tennis pro says...\\
201 - "We don't serve those
kind of balls."\\
202 - What's new, Pussycat?\\
203 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\\
204 - What's new, Pussycat?\\
205 - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\\
206 - Welcome home, friends.\\
207 - Who wants popsicles?\\
208 - Hey,
I don't feel good about this.\\
209 - Well, would you
rather be at Donna's\\
210 - singing backup to
Cha Cha D'Amore?\\
211 - Oh. Well, will you look
who's here.\\
212 - That was a dirty trick, Forman.\\
213 - Well, I'd love to stay
and talk about it,\\
214 - but we're on our way
to the movies.\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - Fine.\\
217 - Then, I'm taking them
bowling Saturday.\\
218 - Yeah!\\
219 - - Fine.
- Ooh, what a fun weekend.\\
220 - Hey, look, you guys can't buy
our loyalty with these little field trips.\\
221 - You're gonna have to start buying
us some stuff we can take home.\\
222 - Well, look, I think it's stupid
to have to go day by day.\\
223 - Why doesn't Donna
just get us on the weekends?\\
224 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
225 - That's not fair because then Eric
gets all the weekday headaches\\
226 - and Donna gets all the fun time.\\
227 - Fine. Then we'll make
a schedule. Eric?\\
228 - Fine. Have a seat.\\
229 - Make sure to schedule time with
Bob. He takes me to Chuckle Town.\\
230 - So, what are you and Dave
gonna do today?\\
231 - Go out to the garage and talk
friend to friend? That would be nice.\\
232 - No.\\
233 - We're gonna turn on the fight\\
234 - and watch two nice men beat
the living hell out of each other.\\
235 - That's nice.\\
236 - Oh. Oh.\\
237 - Oh, come on in, Pastor Dave.\\
238 - Red and I are just so happy
that you are here.\\
239 - - Especially Red.
- Kitty.\\
240 - I want you to know
that it is so nice\\
241 - for Red to finally
have a boyfriend.\\
242 - For God's sakes, Kitty!\\
243 - Oh, lighten up, silly.
Man friend. Whatever.\\
244 - Someone to talk to,
share their feelings with.\\
245 - Anyway, you are an important
part of Red's life.\\
246 - - Oh. Well...
- No. Wait, don't.\\
247 - Don't listen to her.\\
248 - I don't really want to share
my feelings with you.\\
249 - Hell, I don't even think
I have feelings.\\
250 - Now, let's just watch
these two guys\\
251 - beat the crap out of each other.\\
252 - Sold!\\
253 - Well, I don't care what you say.\\
254 - You're boyfriends,
and that's nice.\\
255 - You know, Red, I am so glad
that I have someone to share with,\\
256 - because I woke up this morning
feeling upset.\\
257 - Ha-ha! Gotcha!\\
258 - Good one, Dave.\\
259 - Good one.\\
260 - Don't ever do that again.\\
261 - I'm just saying, Forman,\\
262 - you really didn't deliver on
the afternoon like I was hoping.\\
263 - Dude, I took you everywhere.
I bought everything.\\
264 - It was a great day.\\
265 - I don't know, man. I mean,
I asked you for a six-pack.\\
266 - You brought me out a tall boy.\\
267 - I'm just saying.\\
268 - Fine. Whatever.\\
269 - They're all yours.\\
270 - Twenty minutes late.\\
271 - Sorry. We had to stop
so Fez could pee.\\
272 - Yes, it was my fault.
Please do not fight.\\
273 - Eric, listen, travel time should
come out of your time, not mine.\\
274 - What's on Fez's face?\\
275 - Nothing. Nothing.\\
276 - Is that ice cream?
Now he won't want dinner!\\
277 - I am sorry I ate ice cream,
Donna. Do not be mad.\\
278 - Fez, I'm mad at Eric,
not at you.\\
279 - This is not about you.\\
280 - Listen, I'm not about to limit
our good time to help with yours.\\
281 - Why would you do
anything to help me?\\
282 - Oh, you listen, missy.\\
283 - - I'm not gonna...
- Stop it! Stop it!\\
284 - You are tearing us apart!\\
285 - I hope you're happy.
Now you've upset Fez.\\
286 - Yeah, all right. And your fighting
is making me and Jackie fight,\\
287 - and that interferes
with us doing it.\\
288 - And that ain't good!\\
289 - So, until you guys fix this,\\
290 - we're not hanging out
with either one of you.\\
291 - Let's go.\\
292 - Hyde, I'm sticky.\\
293 - Come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.\\
294 - And I'm sleepy.\\
295 - I know. You had a big day.\\
296 - This is your fault.\\
297 - None of this would have happened
if you hadn't been such a jerk\\
298 - and kicked me out
of the basement.\\
299 - Well, you came in
and you were just so,\\
300 - "Oh, we broke up, and I don't
care, and, hey, let's just watch TV.\\
301 - "Tra la la la la"\\
302 - Eric, I was faking it.\\
303 - I'm miserable and uncomfortable,
and this whole thing sucks.\\
304 - You're miserable?\\
305 - Well, that's great.\\
306 - I mean, I'm miserable too.\\
307 - Okay, so, how about this?\\
308 - We just hang out together
and pretend everything's fine,\\
309 - you know,
for the sake of our friends.\\
310 - - I can do that.
- Okay.\\
311 - But, you know,\\
312 - you have to stop trying to look
so hot when you come over.\\
313 - I have not been doing that.\\
314 - Red lipstick, no bra?\\
315 - Okay, yeah, I did that.\\
316 - And, Fez,
you sit on the dryer. Okay.\\
317 - This new seating arrangement
should really work.\\
318 - There you kids are.\\
319 - I think I finally remembered the
punch line to the Italian midget joke.\\
320 - My mom made fish.\\
321 - I gotta register for the draft.\\
322 - - Me, too.
- I gotta go count
my G.I. Joes.\\
323 - I'll be in the oven.\\
324 - Wow! Tough room.
\subsection {Episode 04: Hyde Gets the Girl}
1 - Elke Sommer to block.
Elke Sommer to block.\\
2 - Oh, you stupid son of a bitch.\\
3 - Donna loved Hollywood Squares.\\
4 - Oh, Forman, come on, man.
Give it a rest, huh?\\
5 - So you're single now.
That's a good thing.\\
6 - Now you're like me, man.\\
7 - You're free to be with lots of
subpar, somewhat sleazy chicks.\\
8 - It's Christmas, baby.\\
9 - Oh, you disguise
your heart, Hyde,\\
10 - but I know you need love.\\
11 - - Why is that?
- 'Cause I need it.\\
12 - All right, I'm going to work before
you two start braiding each other's hair.\\
13 - You know what? I wish for once
Hyde would fall in love, you know?\\
14 - So we could make fun of him.\\
15 - We'd be all, "Hey, everyone...\\
16 - "Hyde's in love."\\
17 - Burn.\\
18 - Oh, I know.
Let's get Hyde a woman.\\
19 - We can have a
let's-get-Hyde-a-woman party.\\
20 - And we can have
food and music and, uh...\\
21 - - Women?
- That's it.\\
22 - Hanging out\\
23 - Down the street\\
24 - The same old thing\\
25 - We did last week\\
26 - Not a thing to do\\
27 - But talk to you\\
28 - We're all all right\\
29 - We're all all right\\
30 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
31 - This party is a great idea.\\
32 - I'm gonna find
the perfect match for Steven.\\
33 - After all, my nickname
is "the queen of romance."\\
34 - No one calls you that.\\
35 - Now, we will each bring
no less than two\\
36 - and no more than five girls
to the party for Hyde, okay?\\
37 - I will console the rejects
with a hot oil massage.\\
38 - I will be nude.\\
39 - Well, I'm out of here. The
radio station's giving away a van\\
40 - and I got to work.
I will be clothed.\\
41 - Well, I think it's a great idea.\\
42 - Steven is almost a man
and he needs to meet a girl\\
43 - who will help him find his way.\\
44 - Yeah, a girl helped me
find my way to hell!\\
45 - I'm in hell.\\
46 - Oh, you're not in hell. If you're
too hot, take off your sweater.\\
47 - - So, it's settled. We'll have the party here.
- No, Kitty.\\
48 - I don't know what you're
talking about, but no.\\
49 - Yes. We're having
a little party for Steven\\
50 - so he can meet his Miss Right.\\
51 - Why is it here?
Why is it always here?\\
52 - Well, what do you want them to
do, have the party in the street?\\
53 - Yes.\\
54 - They puke in the street,
the city cleans it up.\\
55 - Oh, man!\\
56 - Oh, I hope I win this van. I really
need a place to do it with Jackie.\\
57 - Okay, listen up, everybody.
The rules are simple.\\
58 - You place one hand on the van.\\
59 - If you remove your hand
for any reason, you're out.\\
60 - Last person to remove his hand
wins the van. Any questions?\\
61 - You're out.\\
62 - - Any other questions?
- Don't start without me, Max.\\
63 - Oh, God.\\
64 - Hello.\\
65 - My name is Daniel and I've won
every WFPP contest\\
66 - since the Weber Gas Grill
Trampoline Bounce of 1972.\\
67 - I'm unbeatable.
So the choice is yours,\\
68 - joy or despair,\\
69 - pleasure or pain,\\
70 - life or death.\\
71 - I am Daniel!\\
72 - And I cannot be beaten.\\
73 - Look at what I brought.\\
74 - - Big Rhonda?
- Uh-huh.\\
75 - There goes the keg.\\
76 - Everybody, look who's here.\\
77 - A caring, intelligent,
snazzy young man,\\
78 - Steven Hyde.\\
79 - Um, thanks.\\
80 - Hey, man, what's going on?\\
81 - I thought we were watching
Saturday Night Live.\\
82 - Yeah, change of plans.
We're having a party with girls,\\
83 - a keg and girls.\\
84 - For no reason whatsoever.\\
85 - Great.\\
86 - And there's no agenda.\\
87 - All right.\\
88 - Stop grilling me, you bastard.\\
89 - - Hi, Melissa. How's the contest going?
- Lame.\\
90 - But at least the boneheads
are entertaining.\\
91 - Check out that idiot's 'fro.\\
92 - Hey, that's my dad.\\
93 - Oh! Uh...\\
94 - No. Okay, yeah, you're right.\\
95 - So, hey,
what are you doing tonight?\\
96 - We're in Wisconsin, so nothing.\\
97 - Well, I'm going to this party.
It's in a stinky basement\\
98 - and they'll have a stolen keg.\\
99 - - I'm in.
- Cool.\\
100 - Hey, Dad. I brought you
some mints and your Afro pick.\\
101 - Oh, thank God, Donna. My
hair was starting to look silly.\\
102 - Hey, check out the redhead.\\
103 - That redhead is my baby girl,
Donna. I'm her dad.\\
104 - I want Donna to
call me "Daddy."\\
105 - - That's it!
- Ah, Bob.\\
106 - You took your hand
off the van. You lose.\\
107 - - This isn't over.
- It is, for you.\\
108 - Get out of here.\\
109 - And so begins
the battle of wits.\\
110 - Oh, man,
I've never been good at wits.\\
111 - Really?\\
112 - So, chips and dip, huh?\\
113 - Yuh-huh.\\
114 - And the words kind of sound
alike, so that's always fun.\\
115 - Look, no offense, but I'm
really not in the mood for talking.\\
116 - I just broke up with
my girlfriend, so...\\
117 - Oh.\\
118 - You poor thing.\\
119 - You know, you have these
sad lips that are just so hot.\\
120 - Really?\\
121 - I may not be popular,
but if given the chance,\\
122 - I'll put out something fierce.\\
123 - Psst!\\
124 - Psst!\\
125 - How's it going?\\
126 - Great, great, great, great.
'Cause, see, at first,\\
127 - I thought I should wear my
hair up. But, let's be honest,\\
128 - my hair is one of my top five
features, so, voila, it's down.\\
129 - Psst! Psst!\\
130 - Hyde, allow me to introduce
you to a special lady.\\
131 - So, we meet every week to pray
and discuss scripture. You in?\\
132 - I used to date your dad.
Isn't that a turn-on?\\
133 - It's not like head cheerleader's
always the most talented,\\
134 - but in my case, it's true.\\
135 - I have to date guys who aren't
as good-looking as me,\\
136 - otherwise, I'd never date.\\
137 - You gonna eat that?\\
138 - I know you're really angry and
emotionally crippled, but that's okay,\\
139 - 'cause my boyfriend's in jail.\\
140 - My turn-offs include people
who are mean to puppies\\
141 - and people who smoke.\\
142 - Or don't smoke? Or smoke?\\
143 - Wait, do you smoke?\\
144 - Okay, so guess which leg's real.\\
145 - I'm so glad I finally got
to meet you,\\
146 - 'cause I've, like,
always been afraid of you\\
147 - and I like to be scared.\\
148 - So, what do you think?\\
149 - You know, I think,
if I time this right,\\
150 - I can nail every single one
of these girls tonight.\\
151 - No, no, no, no, no. You're
supposed to pick just one,\\
152 - to love, not nail. Love.\\
153 - Yeah, right.\\
154 - Okay, listen to me, Johnny
Cool. I threw this party for you,\\
155 - so you can find one girlfriend
to love you. And that is all. One.\\
156 - You set this up?\\
157 - Yeah, we all thought you needed
help finding a quality woman.\\
158 - What? Man, you sit around
and talk about me?\\
159 - Is that what's going on?
Look, I don't want your help.\\
160 - I give and I do,
and I do and I give.\\
161 - And for what? For nothing.\\
162 - Well, I'm done. Go.\\
163 - - But, Fez...
- I said, go.\\
164 - - Hey, Hyde.
- Hey.\\
165 - This is Melissa. She just
moved here from Chicago.\\
166 - We work at
the radio station together.\\
167 - Melissa, this is Hyde.\\
168 - You're not leaving already,
are you?\\
169 - Uh, no, I came out to
get some fresh air.\\
170 - It's, uh... It's fresher
out here, the air.\\
171 - - I like air. How about you?
- Air's okay.\\
172 - You know what's really good?
Water.\\
173 - That's really...\\
174 - This summer I'm gonna visit
my aunt in Mississippi.\\
175 - Oh, you're going away?
That is sad.\\
176 - Hey, you should come with me,
chocolate milk.\\
177 - When I looked across the room,
I saw a guy who was wounded.\\
178 - A guy who sits in the dark,
waiting for the light to find him again.\\
179 - If only I could find
this light you speak of,\\
180 - then maybe, just maybe,\\
181 - my pain might go away.\\
182 - - Would it help if I held you?
- I doubt it.\\
183 - But let's try, Katie.\\
184 - Yeah, lower. Yeah.\\
185 - - I am so disgusted.
- Oh, I know.\\
186 - There are way too many girls
at this party.\\
187 - I can't even smell
my own perfume.\\
188 - Well, you're the only one.\\
189 - You know, you may not even be
the prettiest girl here.\\
190 - You shut your hole.\\
191 - I am pretty. Unsure.\\
192 - Must find Michael.\\
193 - Hi. You know, I'm a guy\\
194 - who's wounded.\\
195 - - So, I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- Thanks.\\
196 - Get one for yourself, too.\\
197 - No, I...\\
198 - Can...\\
199 - - Can I get you a beer?
- There you go. Thanks.\\
200 - A toast to all my good friends.\\
201 - I will miss you
when I blow out of this burg\\
202 - with the beautiful Big Rhonda.\\
203 - Now it's off to Mississyphilis!\\
204 - Oh, no, Red,
they've been drinking.\\
205 - Well, well, what do you know?\\
206 - Here, Kelso.\\
207 - Thought you might need
some coffee to keep you going.\\
208 - Hey, you know what would be fun?\\
209 - Seeing which one of us could
drink the most coffee, huh?\\
210 - Oh, no. You'll just lose.\\
211 - No, I would not.
I could so beat you.\\
212 - - Well, I doubt that.
- Oh, you're going down.\\
213 - - That's my six to your one!
- Yeah, you really whipped me.\\
214 - Kelso, have you ever been
to Niagara Falls?\\
215 - - Uh-uh.
- Mmm.\\
216 - Don't you like
the soothing sound of water?\\
217 - - Yeah, I guess.
- You ever sat
beside a babbling brook,\\
218 - listening to the beautiful,
steady stream of water?\\
219 - Well, I... Okay, I don't know
if you realize this,\\
220 - but all this talk about water is
really making me have to go pee.\\
221 - Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.\\
222 - Yeah, I can see that
"urine" a lot of pain.\\
223 - Yeah, well, you better shut up,
'cause you're gonna have to go, too.\\
224 - That's where you're wrong.
I am going.\\
225 - I know I just met her,
Mr. Red, but I love her.\\
226 - She is sturdy.\\
227 - I want to climb her.\\
228 - You're just desperate to
give it away, aren't you, son?\\
229 - Yes, yes, I am.\\
230 - Look, there are two things\\
231 - that you need to
learn about women.\\
232 - Oh, finally, the sex talk.\\
233 - First, if a woman
outweighs you by 30 pounds,\\
234 - you're in for trouble.\\
235 - Well, I'll put on weight,
I'll bridge the gap.\\
236 - Which brings me
to my second point.\\
237 - When used separately, women
and alcohol can be a lot of fun.\\
238 - But if you mix them, they
can turn you into a dumbass.\\
239 - - Michael.
- Jackie.\\
240 - - I thought you
were at the party.
- No, it was awful.\\
241 - Do you know what it's like to
be the prettiest girl at a party\\
242 - and not have
anyone acknowledge it?\\
243 - Yes, I do.\\
244 - - Michael, am I pretty?
- Oh, come on, cupcake,\\
245 - you are the prettiest girl
in Point Place.\\
246 - - No, you know what? In Wisconsin.
- Nice one, Pinocchio.\\
247 - - Am I prettier than Pam Macey?
- Of course.\\
248 - - Am I prettier
than Farrah Fawcett?
- Oh, all right, come on,\\
249 - she's like a perfect 10\\
250 - and you are an 11.\\
251 - - Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God.\\
252 - Am I prettier than the girl with the
feathered hair at the supermarket?\\
253 - Okay, okay, the blonde-haired
one or the brown-haired one?\\
254 - Well, does it matter?\\
255 - No, 'cause you
smoke them both, baby!\\
256 - - Am I prettier than...
- Oh, my God!\\
257 - I can't take it anymore.\\
258 - "Am I pretty?" "Am I pretty?"\\
259 - "Am I pretty?" Shut up!\\
260 - And we finally have a winner.\\
261 - I did it! Oh, my God, I won!\\
262 - Who's the best?
I'm the best. Loser!\\
263 - I'm not a loser, okay?
I win everything.\\
264 - I don't lose. I win.\\
265 - Because I'm a winner.\\
266 - I'm a winner!\\
267 - So, Michael Kelso,
tell Wisconsin how it feels\\
268 - to be WFPP's new
Hand 2 Van winner.\\
269 - Well, I guess I have to
say it like this, Max,\\
270 - if this van's a-rocking,
we're in there doing it.\\
271 - - Michael!
- Oh, I'm sorry.\\
272 - I'm doing it with
Jackie Burkhart.\\
273 - If you really think putting my head
on your lap will make me feel better,\\
274 - I mean, I guess I should try.\\
275 - All right, that's it.\\
276 - Excuse me, girls.
I have some information...\\
277 - No, don't listen to what she's...
I'm... She's the one who hurt me.\\
278 - Uh-huh. Yeah. He dumped me.\\
279 - - You dumped her?
- Well, I had to.\\
280 - She wouldn't...
She wouldn't take my ring.\\
281 - - You wouldn't take his ring?
- This is none of
your business,\\
282 - and you are a sad little man.\\
283 - - Oh, poor baby. Do you want my number?
- Yes. Yes, I do.\\
284 - - So, you having fun?
- That reminds me,
I have to go.\\
285 - Uh, Melissa.\\
286 - Um, I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to do something sometime.\\
287 - Sorry, I did something last night and
I already made plans for sometime.\\
288 - No, wait, wait.
Let me try that again.\\
289 - Um, look, if you're not doing anything
Friday night, I'd like to take you out\\
290 - to, um... To...
To dinner and a movie.\\
291 - Pizza?\\
292 - The mall?\\
293 - - Bowling?
- I'd love to.\\
294 - - Call me.
- Call you?\\
295 - That's a little unorthodox.\\
296 - I'll call you.\\
297 - Yes. "I'll call you."
"I'll call you." Whipped.\\
298 - What? I don't care about her.
Melissa who? What the hell!\\
299 - Whipped like the family pig.\\
300 - Rhonda,
I cannot go to Mississippi.\\
301 - - So, you're not coming?
- I'm sorry.\\
302 - But maybe we can go
to the movies sometime.\\
303 - And make out in the theater?
Yeah!\\
304 - Call me.\\
305 - Good God, sober up, man.\\
306 - Oh, screw it, Donna.\\
307 - Fez likes them big, Fez likes
them small, Fez likes them all.
\subsection {Episode 05: Bye-Bye Basement}
1 - Steven, its seven-
damn-thirty in the morning.\\
2 - What the hell
are you doing here?\\
3 - Red, be nice.\\
4 - Steven, we're waiting.\\
5 - Well, I've been living
in the basement.\\
6 - You know, I did notice a
dusting of curly hair on the floor,\\
7 - but I just wrote it off to
my changing teenage body.\\
8 - I moved back in when
my dad got transferred.\\
9 - Transferred?
He's a bartender.\\
10 - Where'd he get
transferred to, the jukebox?\\
11 - You know, Red, if it's cool,\\
12 - I'd kind of rather
not talk about it.\\
13 - Well, Steven, it's important\\
14 - to get these things
out in the open.\\
15 - Kitty, let him do what's natural\\
16 - and keep his
feelings bottled up.\\
17 - Atta-boy.\\
18 - Well...\\
19 - Welcome back, Steven.\\
20 - You know, maybe we can
spruce up your old room\\
21 - since I decided
to redo the basement.\\
22 - What? You're redoing
the basement?\\
23 - Well, honey, no one uses it.\\
24 - I use it.\\
25 - Every day.\\
26 - It's my bat cave.\\
27 - I'll find you a good,
cheap contractor.\\
28 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
29 - This is something
I want to handle myself.\\
30 - This is gonna be
expensive, isn't it?\\
31 - Maybe.\\
32 - Don't you like anything cheap?\\
33 - I like you.\\
34 - Hanging out\\
35 - Down the street\\
36 - The same old thing\\
37 - We did last week\\
38 - Not a thing to do\\
39 - But talk to you\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - We're all all right\\
42 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
43 - Yeah, I'm gonna
miss it down here.\\
44 - Lot of good times.\\
45 - Broke my foot\\
46 - climbing out of this dryer.\\
47 - And my head playing hand ball\\
48 - with the soap in that shower.\\
49 - Me and Jackie totally did it\\
50 - like a bajillion times
on this old sofa.\\
51 - Michael, that's private.\\
52 - I got news for you.
It wasn't that private.\\
53 - Oh, my God!\\
54 - That is the biggest
spider I have ever seen.\\
55 - I think it had
a rat in its mouth!\\
56 - Ugh!\\
57 - Okay, I think maybe the basement\\
58 - isn't the place
for me after all.\\
59 - Oh, you know what, Mom?
I think you might be right.\\
60 - I mean, not only is it
bug-infested down here,\\
61 - but in all honesty, I
think it might be haunted.\\
62 - Get out!\\
63 - That's spooky.\\
64 - I don't know,
Mrs. Forman.\\
65 - I mean, sure it's a pit now,\\
66 - but if you paint, fumigate,\\
67 - and get rid of Eric,\\
68 - this could be a great room.\\
69 - Hey, what...\\
70 - Hey, okay. You're not my
girlfriend anymore, okay?\\
71 - So you don't get an
opinion on my stuff now.\\
72 - Mom, don't listen
to her. She's crazy.\\
73 - Oh, wait, I disagree
with you, so I'm crazy?\\
74 - I think the last time
I disagreed with you\\
75 - was the sanest thing I ever did.\\
76 - Ok, are you referring
to our breakup?\\
77 - Because I must
remind everyone here\\
78 - that she wore my promise ring\\
79 - around her neck.\\
80 - That's crazy!\\
81 - Ring, finger.
Finger, ring.\\
82 - Well, you're lucky I didn't
shove the ring up your ass!\\
83 - Mom...\\
84 - All right, well...
who said, "get out"?\\
85 - Anyway, Mrs. Forman,\\
86 - we have a bunch of
decorating magazines at home.\\
87 - I'll bring them over.\\
88 - Well, thank you, Donna.\\
89 - And I think that ring looked
nice around your neck.\\
90 - Donna, what the hell?\\
91 - What, we're not
going out anymore,\\
92 - so you don't like my basement?\\
93 - Well, I guess now
that I'm an ex-girlfriend,\\
94 - I'm free to tell the truth.\\
95 - Free at last!
Free at last! Whoo!\\
96 - Michael, get Eric some ice.\\
97 - Why?\\
98 - For that wicked burn!
Burn, Eric, burn!\\
99 - Oh, happy day.\\
100 - Your friend Fez has
taken his love of dance\\
101 - to its logical conclusion.\\
102 - I have joined a ballet class.\\
103 - Man, no offense,\\
104 - but you're, like,
one good cry away\\
105 - from being the total woman.\\
106 - Oh, really? Well,
would a total woman\\
107 - have her own
pink satin slippers?\\
108 - Oh, Red.
Here, um...\\
109 - Meet our contractors.\\
110 - This is Theo.\\
111 - And...\\
112 - Hey, Mr. Eric's dad.\\
113 - This is who you hired
to redo our basement?\\
114 - Well, no, no.\\
115 - Actually, I...
I hired Theo.\\
116 - And, uh, I didn't
really expect Leo.\\
117 - That was, um...
That was a bonus!\\
118 - Ha, ha, ha!\\
119 - Here, shoo, Leo.\\
120 - Uh, don't worry,
ma'am. Leo is solid.\\
121 - And he's not allowed to
touch anything electrical.\\
122 - Kitty, I hate to interfere...\\
123 - I understand your concern, sir.\\
124 - But I'm not an
irresponsible screw-up\\
125 - like my cousin Leo.\\
126 - That's true, man.\\
127 - I used to be like Leo,\\
128 - sitting around all day,
wasting my life.\\
129 - But then one day
the smoke cleared.\\
130 - See, red? He had
an epiphany.\\
131 - Actually, I ran out of weed
and the smoke cleared.\\
132 - But, uh...\\
133 - Then I saw how trashed
my apartment was,\\
134 - so I rebuilt it.\\
135 - Been a contractor ever since.\\
136 - Well, I'm sold.\\
137 - Okay, Donna.\\
138 - When did you stop
liking my basement?\\
139 - I never liked it.\\
140 - There were a lot of things I kept
to myself when we were dating.\\
141 - Yeah, well...\\
142 - There were plenty of
things I kept to myself.\\
143 - Plenty.\\
144 - Like what, for instance?\\
145 - I'm sure Donna
would like to know.\\
146 - Yeah. Like what,
for instance?\\
147 - Well, like...\\
148 - Why don't you just start first?\\
149 - Okay. You know how when
you eat and you smack your lips\\
150 - in that really cute way?\\
151 - Yeah.\\
152 - It's disgusting.\\
153 - That's all you got?\\
154 - No. You have
tiny wrists.\\
155 - What?\\
156 - No, I don't.\\
157 - Mom, do I have tiny wrists?\\
158 - No, not tiny. Dainty.\\
159 - No, no, no, no.
No, no.\\
160 - The doctor always said
you were in the normal range.\\
161 - See? Normal.\\
162 - Big bone magoo.\\
163 - Ooh. That's nice.\\
164 - You don't have to tell me.\\
165 - It's really cool you're here.\\
166 - Most men won't
take ballet class.\\
167 - Oh, my pet...\\
168 - Most men are not Fez.\\
169 - This whole basement
thing is Donna's fault.\\
170 - I... what's
her problem?\\
171 - She's been messing
with me all day.\\
172 - Could be payback.\\
173 - For what?\\
174 - Well, she had to see
you naked for two years.\\
175 - That must have been unpleasant.\\
176 - You know, for a guy
who's been orphaned twice,\\
177 - you really lack compassion.\\
178 - Speaking of hurtful things...\\
179 - Hey, where's your dad, man?\\
180 - Okay.\\
181 - He, um...\\
182 - He went to work for the police.\\
183 - Developing high-tech handcuffs\\
184 - to restrain people
with tiny wrists.\\
185 - Hey, uh...\\
186 - Puffy shirt guy called.\\
187 - He wants his puffy shirt back.\\
188 - Things at ballet class have
taken a turn for the worse.\\
189 - Somehow I've become
one of the girls.\\
190 - A hairy brown girl.\\
191 - Hey, uh, Fez...\\
192 - Does that shirt come
with its own bicycle pump?\\
193 - Well, you should talk.
That shirt makes you\\
194 - look like a stick
of fruit-stripe gum.\\
195 - God, what did you have
for breakfast this morning?\\
196 - Carnation instant bitch?\\
197 - Okay, that one
was out of the park.\\
198 - Ugh! I am so bored
with you two!\\
199 - You know what? I actually
want to talk about Fez.\\
200 - Fez, why don't the
women at ballet love you?\\
201 - I don't know. They let
me touch their thighs,\\
202 - but not their hearts.\\
203 - You know what might help?\\
204 - If you dress a little
more masculine.\\
205 - Hey, Hyde.
Huh?\\
206 - You know what
my favorite ballet is?\\
207 - The Nutcracker?\\
208 - Ohh...\\
209 - Hey, guys.\\
210 - Don't you think
it's time to knock off?\\
211 - You know?
Maybe forever.\\
212 - Yeah, well, we're not done yet.\\
213 - Don't let us get in your way.\\
214 - Do whatever you'd normally do.\\
215 - This is what you normally do?\\
216 - I used to do this, too,\\
217 - back when I was being an artist.\\
218 - I love art.\\
219 - But I hate work.\\
220 - But... I love art.\\
221 - But I hate work.\\
222 - Do you hear that, Forman?\\
223 - Theo's an artist who hates work.\\
224 - And who, at this moment,\\
225 - is very open to suggestion.\\
226 - Oh. I gotcha, Hyde.\\
227 - Theo...\\
228 - Cluck like a chicken.
Do it.\\
229 - Ow!\\
230 - Oh.\\
231 - Theo, if you're unhappy,\\
232 - and I hope you are,\\
233 - you gotta be true to yourself.\\
234 - Give up construction, man.
Go back to art.\\
235 - You broke up with art?\\
236 - I mean, I don't know
what Eric's problem is.\\
237 - I wasn't being a bitch, was I?\\
238 - Oh... Donna,
I know from bitch,\\
239 - and, yes, yes, you were.\\
240 - But I feel much
closer to you now.\\
241 - All right. Okay.\\
242 - I know what's going on here.\\
243 - You're being mean to Eric\\
244 - 'cause you want
to do it with him.\\
245 - I mean, when Jackie dumped me,\\
246 - I had a butt load of leftover\\
247 - wanting-to-
do-it-with-her, feelings.\\
248 - Oh, my God.\\
249 - You morons might be right.\\
250 - But why do I have these
stupid feelings left over?\\
251 - I mean, I just want to
be friends with him now.\\
252 - What a child.\\
253 - So innocent.\\
254 - Mmm.\\
255 - You're never gonna be
friends with him, all right?\\
256 - The only reason he
was friends with you\\
257 - is so he could do it with you.\\
258 - Really?\\
259 - So he made friends
with me when I was five\\
260 - so he could do it with me
when I was 17?\\
261 - Well, that and your
sweet big wheel.\\
262 - Okay, off to ballet class now.\\
263 - More masculine, yes?\\
264 - Ok, we're all done.\\
265 - But you've only been here a day.\\
266 - Well, you know what they say.\\
267 - Rome was built in a day.\\
268 - No, uh, Rome wasn't
built in a day.\\
269 - Well, your basement
was built in a day.\\
270 - Ta-da!\\
271 - You didn't do anything.\\
272 - It's a commentary.\\
273 - See, you wanted to
change your basement\\
274 - into something that it wasn't,\\
275 - so, instead of giving you\\
276 - something that you
thought you wanted,\\
277 - I gave you something
that you needed.\\
278 - Red...\\
279 - I think my contractor's on dope.\\
280 - No need to thank me.\\
281 - Oh, we won't...\\
282 - Because you didn't
do anything, hop-head.\\
283 - Look!\\
284 - It's art.\\
285 - I moved everything
in this basement\\
286 - two inches to the left.\\
287 - Oh, yeah.\\
288 - I call it, Basement,\\
289 - Two Inches To The Left.\\
290 - It's wild, huh?\\
291 - I mean, it's like,\\
292 - where are you?\\
293 - All right.\\
294 - Mrs. Eric's mother would
like you to leave now.\\
295 - Okay, you don't get it...\\
296 - But when your life shifts\\
297 - two inches to the left,\\
298 - you're gonna call me. Ohh, yes.\\
299 - You are gonna call me.\\
300 - And if you like our work,\\
301 - tell your friends, okay?\\
302 - Oh, well.\\
303 - Look who finally got
his basement back.\\
304 - Yep. Out with the two
hippie burnouts.\\
305 - Walk tall.\\
306 - So, hey, Hyde...\\
307 - Come on. Where's
your dad, really?\\
308 - Fine, you wanna know?\\
309 - He and my mom got back together.\\
310 - No way. No way.
That's great.\\
311 - So, where are they?\\
312 - I can't tell you.\\
313 - Why not?\\
314 - 'Cause they won't tell me.\\
315 - They split on you?\\
316 - Oh, man.\\
317 - Oh, man. See, this is
why I didn't wanna tell you.\\
318 - I knew you'd get all "after
school special" on me.\\
319 - Me?
Please.\\
320 - It's ok.\\
321 - You're home now.\\
322 - Get off me, man.\\
323 - No, you let me
love you, orphan boy.\\
324 - Don't hide from your feelings.\\
325 - So, hey.\\
326 - Hey.\\
327 - Look, I'm sorry I've been so...\\
328 - Bitchy?\\
329 - Yeah, I hadn't noticed.\\
330 - Who said "bitchy"?\\
331 - Yeah, well, it turns out\\
332 - that there are some lingering
feelings or something.\\
333 - Not real feelings, just
like lingering urges...\\
334 - But they're just
lingering feelings.\\
335 - They're not actual feelings.\\
336 - Just wanna make that very clear.\\
337 - You have by using the
word "lingering," like, 6 times.\\
338 - Okay.\\
339 - And the basement's
actually really cool...\\
340 - And your wrists are very wide.\\
341 - Hmm, um, there must be some way\\
342 - to break the tension here.\\
343 - Oh, I know.\\
344 - Let's just have sex.\\
345 - Okay.
Really?\\
346 - No. See ya.\\
347 - Like I wanted to.\\
348 - I did want to.
\subsection {Episode 06: The Relapse (1)}
1 - Good morning.
I have terrible news.\\
2 - Are we out of bacon?\\
3 - No. I was outside...\\
4 - Remember that time
we were out of bacon?\\
5 - Do I?\\
6 - Nearly tore this family apart.\\
7 - Listen to me!\\
8 - Midge left Bob.\\
9 - Are you sure?\\
10 - I mean, maybe she's
just lost in the backyard.\\
11 - This is serious.
I was up early,\\
12 - and I saw Midge
getting into her car\\
13 - with a suitcase and I said,\\
14 - "Where are you
going, Midge?"\\
15 - Because I'm concerned, not nosy,\\
16 - and she said to me,\\
17 - "I am leaving Bob, and
I am never coming back."\\
18 - - And I said...
- "Okay".\\
19 - And then...\\
20 - I laughed like I do
when I'm uncomfortable.\\
21 - But what about Donna?\\
22 - I mean...
what're they gonna do?\\
23 - Well, okay, they
are going to depend\\
24 - on the kindness of their
friends and neighbors,\\
25 - which is why we need
to go over there\\
26 - as a family, to comfort them.\\
27 - Yikes.
I don't think so.\\
28 - Why not?\\
29 - Well, it just
seems like it'd be,\\
30 - like, there'd be
an awful lot of...\\
31 - Crying.\\
32 - Yeah.\\
33 - So... no.\\
34 - Yeah, no.\\
35 - Well, fine.\\
36 - I will go myself.\\
37 - Hey, where are you
going with my food?\\
38 - To Bob and Donna.\\
39 - When your wife
or mother leaves you,\\
40 - you need a good breakfast.\\
41 - I need a good breakfast.\\
42 - Well, I didn't leave you.
Eat a pop-tart!\\
43 - When I woke up, her
bag was packed and she left.\\
44 - Didn't even say
where she was going.\\
45 - On the other hand,
we have pancakes\\
46 - with egg eyes\\
47 - and bacon smiley faces!\\
48 - The hash brown hair is nice.\\
49 - I can't believe
she would just take off\\
50 - without even
a hint or a warning.\\
51 - No warning?\\
52 - Dad, she was always saying,\\
53 - "I'm unhappy,
and I'm gonna leave."\\
54 - Honey, that's just
what married people say.\\
55 - Did she say where she was going?\\
56 - Well, um, she said she was
going to California... to...\\
57 - To be a star on Broadway.\\
58 - So...\\
59 - Oh, Midgie.\\
60 - She may not have been smart,\\
61 - but she sure was sweet.\\
62 - And built, too, boy.\\
63 - Okay.\\
64 - Thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but I'm really not hungry.\\
65 - Oh, what a nightmare.\\
66 - She was unhappy, Bob.\\
67 - No. She took the El Dorado.\\
68 - Hanging out\\
69 - Down the street\\
70 - The same old thing\\
71 - We did last week\\
72 - Not a thing to do\\
73 - But talk to you\\
74 - We're all all right\\
75 - We're all all right\\
76 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
77 - So Midge just took off?\\
78 - Ah. Poor Donna.\\
79 - Yeah, this is really bad.\\
80 - Yeah, not only did
Donna lose her mom,\\
81 - we all lost Midge's
sweet uptown rack.\\
82 - Oh, good God, man,\\
83 - what a marvelous set of kittens.\\
84 - Remember that sweater?
Oh.\\
85 - Remember that other sweater?\\
86 - Yeah.\\
87 - Remember that time
she ran up to us in a sweater?\\
88 - Remember the week
she took up jump rope?\\
89 - In a sweater?\\
90 - Eric!\\
91 - What are you boys
thinking about so hard?\\
92 - Nothing.
Homework.\\
93 - Jesus.
Kittens.\\
94 - Okay, um, Eric, I need you\\
95 - to take a casserole
to the Pinciottis.\\
96 - So run upstairs and\\
97 - put on a nice clean shirt
and a sport coat.\\
98 - What? No, I'm not
going over there.\\
99 - Donna and I broke up,
and things are weird with us.\\
100 - Well, that's too bad.\\
101 - Because I went over there,
and Bob's a crier.\\
102 - And a hugger.\\
103 - And when you get caught
in a crying-Bob hug,\\
104 - there is no escape,\\
105 - and I cannot go back over there!\\
106 - I don't know.
I like to be hugged by Bob.\\
107 - Makes me feel safe.\\
108 - Okay, okay, there he is.
Go talk to him.\\
109 - No, Kitty, it's a
personal matter and I...\\
110 - Oh!\\
111 - That's mature.\\
112 - Hey, there, Red!\\
113 - Hi, Bob.\\
114 - What a day, huh?
What a day\\
115 - to be alive. I feel great.\\
116 - You do?\\
117 - Well, then...\\
118 - I can go back inside.\\
119 - Bye.\\
120 - Yep, Midgie's been on me
for weeks to weed the garden.\\
121 - And I'm finally
getting around to it,\\
122 - so when she comes back,\\
123 - she's gonna see that I did it.\\
124 - You think she's coming back?\\
125 - Well, why shouldn't she?
I did all the right things.\\
126 - We had an open marriage,
experimented with drugs.\\
127 - I even threw nudist parties.\\
128 - Yeah, what more
could a husband do?\\
129 - All right. Let's not get
bummed out, guys, okay?\\
130 - There are a lot of
other hot older women\\
131 - out there besides Midge.\\
132 - And they deserve our respect,\\
133 - 'cause they can teach us stuff.\\
134 - Yes, I would love to make love
to an 80-year-old.\\
135 - They must know everything.\\
136 - And not just about sex,
but history and trivia, too.\\
137 - Yeah.\\
138 - The young ones are too timid,
but the older ones,\\
139 - they know it won't break.\\
140 - How could it break?
It is invincible.\\
141 - Yeah, and plus,
they're, like, grateful,\\
142 - you know, so they'll do it
with, like, almost anybody.\\
143 - Anybody?\\
144 - Well, that's me.\\
145 - Let's find Fez
a dirty housewife to love.\\
146 - Yeah, man, I'm in. Hyde?\\
147 - I don't know, guys.
I was gonna go watch Donahue.\\
148 - What do you think the chances
are of Fez getting burned?\\
149 - Pretty good.
Damn good.\\
150 - Then I am in.\\
151 - Hey.
Hey.\\
152 - So...\\
153 - Hey, look, I'm really sorry
about your mom.\\
154 - And, uh...\\
155 - I mean...\\
156 - Are you okay?\\
157 - I don't know. It's weird.\\
158 - Yeah, well, you know, it
won't make you feel any better,\\
159 - but for some reason
I brought you a casserole.\\
160 - I mean,\\
161 - why is it that every time
something bad happens,\\
162 - grownups always
think you need food?\\
163 - You know? You lost your job?\\
164 - "Congratulations, you got
a bucket of chicken!"\\
165 - I mean, the last
thing you want is to...\\
166 - Are these crushed potato chips?\\
167 - Look...\\
168 - Donna, look...\\
169 - I know we broke up,\\
170 - but I still, you know...\\
171 - I still care about you.\\
172 - Okay. Okay.\\
173 - So...\\
174 - Eric, in the bedroom.\\
175 - Oh, yeah, I knew that.\\
176 - I'll just... I'm gonna...\\
177 - Is that a tennis getup?\\
178 - Yup.\\
179 - Yeah, I'm out.\\
180 - What's his problem?
This is the\\
181 - perfect outfit for
picking up older ladies.\\
182 - Uh-huh. How's that?\\
183 - Well, everyone knows that\\
184 - horny older ladies hang out
at tennis clubs.\\
185 - Yeah, well, see, Fez,\\
186 - Point Place doesn't have a
tennis club or even a tennis court.\\
187 - We do have that concrete wall
behind the gym,\\
188 - but people mostly
use that just for\\
189 - smoking weed and
beating up freshmen.\\
190 - And foreign exchange students.\\
191 - You were new, okay?\\
192 - No. You know
where we've gotta go\\
193 - to get the ladies,
is the grocery store.\\
194 - Oh, the Piggly Wiggly?
I love the Piggly Wiggly.\\
195 - They have candy.\\
196 - Yeah. And older ladies.\\
197 - And candy.\\
198 - Yeah, but the important thing
is the older ladies.\\
199 - And candy.\\
200 - All right, Fez.
What do you want?\\
201 - The older ladies or the candy?\\
202 - Fine, you win.
The older ladies.\\
203 - Thank you.
And candy.\\
204 - It was the sport coat, right?\\
205 - Again?
Yes, please.\\
206 - So, you don't want to cuddle?\\
207 - That's cool.\\
208 - Bob thinks Midge is coming back?\\
209 - That is the saddest
thing I ever heard.\\
210 - Oh, come on, Kitty. Let
him think it. Who does it hurt?\\
211 - It hurts Bob.\\
212 - Well, who else does it hurt?\\
213 - Steven.\\
214 - Red, Bob has to grieve
so the healing can begin.\\
215 - But, Kitty, then
he'll grieve all over me.\\
216 - Hey, remember that time
Bob ate a bad taco\\
217 - and grieved all inside your car?\\
218 - Thank you. Case closed.\\
219 - Why would you bring that up?\\
220 - Sorry, Mrs. Forman.\\
221 - It's just that it was gross,
so I think about it a lot.\\
222 - Hi, kids. Good to see you.
Good to see you.\\
223 - Someone is looking
lovely today, Mom.\\
224 - What's with you, man?\\
225 - Oh, I guess a little thing like\\
226 - getting back
together with your old gal\\
227 - puts a spring in a man's step.\\
228 - You and Donna are back
together? That is wonderful!\\
229 - So did you talk things through?\\
230 - No.\\
231 - Then how do you know
you're back together?\\
232 - Yeah, we talked things through.\\
233 - Talked or grunted?\\
234 - Stifle.\\
235 - Okay, well, good.\\
236 - I'm gonna need details.\\
237 - Oh, there will be
details aplenty\\
238 - in my steamy
letter to Penthouse.\\
239 - Okay, my mom's still
behind me, isn't she?\\
240 - So you guys did it?\\
241 - Twice.\\
242 - Five times.\\
243 - Nice.\\
244 - And
you're back together?\\
245 - Oh, yeah.
God, no.\\
246 - It was like... magic.\\
247 - Oh, I feel sick.\\
248 - Yep, we're back together.\\
249 - And, Hyde,
more than this, much...\\
250 - more than this...\\
251 - I'm sure he's
forgotten all about it.\\
252 - Man, back when I was
cheating on Jackie,\\
253 - I used to meet a ton
of older ladies here.\\
254 - Hello, Michael.\\
255 - Hey, Joyce.\\
256 - That's Coach Ferguson's wife!\\
257 - Yeah. She's lonely,
and she drinks.\\
258 - You're a Piggly Wiggly god.\\
259 - Yeah.\\
260 - Ooh-la-la!\\
261 - Oh, me like.\\
262 - Go make your move, man.\\
263 - Aye, no.\\
264 - After I painted
Midgie's bathroom pink,\\
265 - sprinkled a little
lavender water\\
266 - in her toilet like she likes,\\
267 - I went out and got these
chocolates. I hope she likes them.\\
268 - I guess we'll find out
when she comes back, huh?\\
269 - Bob, she... I...\\
270 - Oh, Bob, you poor,
dumb son of a bitch.\\
271 - That's mean.\\
272 - Bob, she's not coming back.\\
273 - Yes, she is.
No, she's not.\\
274 - Yes, she is.
No, she's not.\\
275 - Yes, she is.
No, she's not!\\
276 - Yes, she is!\\
277 - Fine!\\
278 - These chocolates
are for Midge, Bob?\\
279 - They're for Midge? Fine!\\
280 - Let's give them to Midge!\\
281 - Here you go, Midge!\\
282 - You're throwing away
Midgie's chocolates.\\
283 - And why would I do that, Bob?\\
284 - 'Cause you're mean.\\
285 - And why else?\\
286 - She's not coming back, is she?\\
287 - I knew that.\\
288 - Listen, you wanna go get a beer?\\
289 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
290 - You're a good friend.\\
291 - I might cry.\\
292 - And I might hit you.\\
293 - Michael, how could you bring\\
294 - poor, sweet Fez
to the Piggly Wiggly?\\
295 - There are a lot of footloose
women in that store.\\
296 - Do you know Joyce Ferguson?\\
297 - Who? No! That's a lie!\\
298 - What? What?
What? What?\\
299 - And you.\\
300 - Grabbing strange rear ends
is no way to meet a nice girl.\\
301 - It's rude,
ungentlemanly behavior\\
302 - that will not be appreciated
by a woman of class.\\
303 - And thank you for the
compliment. It made my day.\\
304 - You know what I just noticed?
Mrs. Forman is hot.\\
305 - Yeah, she's a cutie.\\
306 - And firm.\\
307 - You know, maybe we should
get her a sweater for Christmas.\\
308 - She actually doesn't want
to be with you at all.\\
309 - Isn't that hilarious?\\
310 - Yeah, he thinks
you're back together.\\
311 - It's really sad.\\
312 - Hold on. What?\\
313 - Look, she said she would've
done it with anybody.\\
314 - No, no.
Donna wouldn't say that.\\
315 - I mean, it was like I would've
done it with anybody.\\
316 - Anybody?\\
317 - Damn, and I was just over
there watching stupid Donahue.\\
318 - Hey, let's do it right now.\\
319 - Eric's gonna be so mad.\\
320 - Are you mad?
So mad.\\
321 - Yeah, I'm just kidding
about the "do it" stuff.\\
322 - I'm sorry about your mom.\\
323 - Thanks.\\
324 - You know what?\\
325 - That's it.
She can't use me like this.\\
326 - I'm going over there
to yell at her right now!\\
327 - With yelling!\\
328 - Seriously,
let's do it right now.\\
329 - Okay, listen.
You need to tell me\\
330 - what the hell you
think you're doing!\\
331 - What am I doing?
Well, my mom left us,\\
332 - so I'm boxing up her clothes,\\
333 - because I can't
look at them anymore.\\
334 - And I'm sorry for
needing you, but I did.\\
335 - So if you have something
to say to me, just say it.\\
336 - Okay, thank you!\\
337 - I did have something to say,
and it was good!\\
338 - But that was before you said your
mom stuff and your sad-clothes stuff,\\
339 - and now my sex stuff...\\
340 - sounds...\\
341 - sucky.\\
342 - Look, I'm sorry if
you thought that we...\\
343 - No. No, I'm sorry.\\
344 - Let's just... What...\\
345 - What, do you need
some help or something?\\
346 - Yeah, thanks.\\
347 - Oh, my God.\\
348 - Oh, my God.\\
349 - This is mine.\\
350 - Midge borrowed it,
and she never gave it back.\\
351 - I bet my bra's here, too.\\
352 - I miss
my li'l Midgers.\\
353 - Bob, you know the rules.
You cry, you buy.\\
354 - Three pitchers, please.\\
355 - Hi.
\subsection {Episode 07: Uncomfortable Ball Stuff (2)}
1 - Hey, Mrs. Forman.\\
2 - My dad's making a cheese
sandwich, but he's missing some stuff.\\
3 - So, can I borrow
bread and cheese?\\
4 - Oh, your dad's having a hard
time without your mom, isn't he?\\
5 - Midge was the brains
of that outfit?\\
6 - Oh, I'm sorry, Donna.\\
7 - - Sorry about what?
- You, get Donna
bread and cheese.\\
8 - Okay.\\
9 - Wow.
This is a really nice dress.\\
10 - I know. Isn't it fancy?\\
11 - It's for the Price Mart Ball
tomorrow night.\\
12 - Oh, right, the Price Mart Ball.\\
13 - So who are you taking?
Who's the lucky lady?\\
14 - Oh, well, I decided not to go.\\
15 - - Personal choice.
- You don't have a date,
do you?\\
16 - Okay, you know what?\\
17 - It's not about,
"Can I get a date?"\\
18 - It's about this great book
that I'm, like, halfway through.\\
19 - Plus, you know,
I could get a date.\\
20 - I've got numbers, buddy.\\
21 - Sure you do, honey.
You're number one with me.\\
22 - You're going tomorrow night,
and you'd better not go stag, Eric.\\
23 - There's nothing worse than an 80-pound
boy dancing with his mommy all night.\\
24 - You know what? I'll go.\\
25 - I told you I would,
like, months ago.\\
26 - But that was before the\\
27 - - ugliness.
- Eric, I'm over it.\\
28 - Hey, I'm over it.\\
29 - Oh, I'm... I'm over it.\\
30 - Plus, I mean, last year they
had all-you-can-eat shrimp.\\
31 - Well, I mean,
you know, I'm over it.\\
32 - Hey, I'm over it.
Yeah, I'm over it.\\
33 - I was just worried that
you might think it was weird,\\
34 - us going out on a date.\\
35 - So, I mean, you know,
the concern laid with you.\\
36 - Eric, it's not a date.\\
37 - It's not, I know. I know it's
not a date. It's not a date.\\
38 - It's a\\
39 - shrimp fest.\\
40 - A festival of shrimp,
if you will.\\
41 - - Exactly.
- So...\\
42 - - I'll see you tomorrow night.
- Okay.\\
43 - See, now, look.\\
44 - My little prince is
going to the ball.\\
45 - Hanging out\\
46 - Down the street\\
47 - The same old thing\\
48 - We did last week\\
49 - Not a thing to do\\
50 - But talk to you\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - So, Forman,
you break up with Donna,\\
55 - but you still get to have sex
and go out on dates with her?\\
56 - Ride the big red wave, dude.\\
57 - I should break up with Donna.
"Donna, we are through.\\
58 - "Let the sex
and dating begin."\\
59 - Oh, no. It's not a date.\\
60 - We're just friends now,
because she's over it.\\
61 - - Well, guess who else
is over it?
- I am.\\
62 - - Me, too.
- So over it.\\
63 - Look, man,
breaking up sucks, okay?\\
64 - When Jackie dumped me,
you know what she said?\\
65 - "Something, something.
Never wanna see you again.\\
66 - "Blah-blah-blah."\\
67 - Hey, you think that didn't hurt?\\
68 - Okay, you know what?\\
69 - - I'm done talking about this.
- Good.\\
70 - But I will say this.\\
71 - If she doesn't want it to be a
date, then it won't be a date.\\
72 - I am so cool with that,
because, as we all know,\\
73 - I am very mature.\\
74 - Now, if you would
all please excuse me,\\
75 - my mommy has to
iron my corduroys.\\
76 - Ah, women.\\
77 - Am I right, guys?\\
78 - Ah, who am I kidding?\\
79 - There's no woman for Fez.\\
80 - What must Fez do to get a woman?\\
81 - Well, for one thing, he's gotta
cut out that third-person crap.\\
82 - It's weird.\\
83 - You are Fez.\\
84 - You know something else?\\
85 - Shoes say a lot about a man.\\
86 - In your case, your chukka
boots are screaming "virgin."\\
87 - Damn you, boots.\\
88 - What else have you told them?\\
89 - Hey, Fez,\\
90 - seeing you wear those chukkas
makes me wanna up-chukka.\\
91 - - Nice.
- Yeah.\\
92 - It's like I ate too many
chukka-late chip cookies.\\
93 - Okay.\\
94 - Yeah, how much wood
could a woodchukka chukka...\\
95 - Hey. Shut the chukka up.\\
96 - How am I supposed
to afford new boots?\\
97 - My Bible-thumping host parents\\
98 - won't give me an allowance
because I am a pagan.\\
99 - You know, Leo's looking
for help down at The Fotohut.\\
100 - The Fotohut, huh?\\
101 - I can really picture
myself there.\\
102 - That job and I
will really click.\\
103 - Oh, I am on a roll\\
104 - of film.\\
105 - Ow!\\
106 - Don't be so negative.\\
107 - I am the king.\\
108 - You sure you wanna get in
the Fotohut game?\\
109 - Now, it can chew you up and
spit you out like a stick of gum,\\
110 - or something that seemed
edible till you put it in your mouth\\
111 - and then you realized it's not.\\
112 - Or a stick of gum.\\
113 - - What kind of gum?
- Big Red.\\
114 - Oh, that's fine.\\
115 - Okay, you're hired,
but you're on probation.\\
116 - No, wait. I'm on probation.\\
117 - Oh, wow, I gotta go see
my probation officer.\\
118 - - So he's my new boss?
- Welcome to paradise.\\
119 - Oh, Red, don't the kids
look nice for their date?\\
120 - Yeah. Nice as hell.\\
121 - - Oh, well,
thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Actually, Mom,\\
122 - as Donna so thoughtfully
pointed out earlier, this isn't a date.\\
123 - Well, I just... I like seeing you
two together. You look so natural.\\
124 - But we're not together.\\
125 - Well, sure you are.
I'm looking right at you.\\
126 - Let's spend the night in the
driveway looking at the kids.\\
127 - That's what I wanna do.\\
128 - Oh, hang on one sec.\\
129 - Oh, hey, Donna?\\
130 - Why don't you make like
a circle and go 'round, okay?\\
131 - That's right. Like a circle.\\
132 - - Slide over or I'll
hit you in the head.
- All right.\\
133 - - You got yelled at.
- Shut up.\\
134 - Oh, okay, this is us.\\
135 - See? This is great.\\
136 - Being out together, not
on a date, just friends.\\
137 - I feel, like,
virtually nothing for you.\\
138 - Me, too.
Here, let's have a seat.\\
139 - Here you go.
Oh, whoops. Not a date.\\
140 - - Eric!
- I'm sorry.\\
141 - Okay, minor glitch.\\
142 - Let's let the good times roll.\\
143 - Isn't this nice?\\
144 - Okay, Kitty. Enough jawing.\\
145 - Drinks are only free
for the first two hours.\\
146 - Oh, do you think they have
peach schnapps?\\
147 - Peach is my favorite schnapp.\\
148 - Hi. I'm Lyle.
Housewares manager in Oshkosh.\\
149 - Hi.
Eric, stock boy, Point Place.\\
150 - And this is my friend,\\
151 - Donna.\\
152 - We're not on a date,
even though, I mean...\\
153 - Even though I did pay for her.\\
154 - But what can you do?\\
155 - Tell me, Lyle,
are you here on a real date?\\
156 - Hey, that's Stewie. Stewie.\\
157 - Nice going. Scared off Lyle.\\
158 - Now we'll never meet Stewie.\\
159 - Eric, what is wrong with you?\\
160 - Hey, guy, put your arm
around your date.\\
161 - - Oh, no, she's not my date...
- Oh, just shut up
and take the picture.\\
162 - Ta-da!\\
163 - Quitting time, chief?\\
164 - No.\\
165 - I devised a system
to streamline our operations.\\
166 - From now on, all orders
will be filed alphabetically.\\
167 - So the size of
a customer's boobs?\\
168 - No longer a factor.\\
169 - You see, it saves time.
And time, my friend, is money.\\
170 - But money is not time.\\
171 - You'd think it would go
both ways, but it doesn't.\\
172 - Hey.\\
173 - Moby Dick called.
He wants his shrimp back.\\
174 - It's those hilarious jokes that I
miss so much since we broke up.\\
175 - So, uh, should I get us
some punch or...\\
176 - Wait. Do you get the punch?
Oh, no.\\
177 - How do we get the punch?\\
178 - Eric, stop it.
You're being an ass.\\
179 - Well, why don't you just,
you know, get over it?\\
180 - I only said that because
I wanna be friends again.\\
181 - I mean, I wish we could pretend that
we were never boyfriend and girlfriend\\
182 - and just, you know, be friends.\\
183 - Donna, it's hard. It's not like
being friends with Hyde, okay?\\
184 - I haven't, you know,\\
185 - touched his fun parts.\\
186 - Well, on purpose.\\
187 - - We used to have
a lot of fun together.
- Yeah.\\
188 - Just like there used to be
shrimp in the world.\\
189 - Okay.\\
190 - Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.\\
191 - When I get back, we're gonna
have a lot of fun together.\\
192 - - Okay.
- Okay.\\
193 - Hello.\\
194 - Hi, I'm Connie.
Pet Supplies, Sheboygan.\\
195 - Do you, uh, wanna dance?\\
196 - Oh, uh...\\
197 - Yeah, I'm kind of
here with someone, so...\\
198 - Okay. Well, maybe
I'll see you around.\\
199 - Okay.\\
200 - - What the hell
is wrong with you?
- Okay, you hurt my arm.\\
201 - She was a real looker, and for
some reason, she talked to you.\\
202 - - Go get her.
- What? No.\\
203 - Dad, Donna's here.\\
204 - Well, Donna's off having fun, while
you're sitting here being a big lump.\\
205 - Okay, first of all,\\
206 - you are way too involved
with my life, okay?\\
207 - And second of all, Donna's not
having fun. She's in the bathroom.\\
208 - That's not the bathroom.\\
209 - Now go talk to that girl
before she comes to her senses\\
210 - and wants nothing to do
with you.\\
211 - Oh, God. Your mother's doing
shots with Gladys from Housewares.\\
212 - Kitty, put it down.\\
213 - My wife left me. I don't cook.
I don't shop. I'm hungry.\\
214 - This place scares me,
and I like Salisbury steak.\\
215 - So you don't cook or shop,
and your idea of a nice meal\\
216 - is gristly hamburger
smothered in goo?\\
217 - What woman could let
all that go?\\
218 - Hey, I've got an upside.\\
219 - There are things.\\
220 - I know. You're a good guy.\\
221 - A good, old-fashioned,
out-of-touch, Stone Age guy.\\
222 - But, you know,
there's nothing wrong with you\\
223 - that changing yourself
completely couldn't fix.\\
224 - Thank you.\\
225 - Here. In the meantime,
have a pretzel.\\
226 - - I can tell you
haven't eaten anything.
- I am pretty hungry.\\
227 - Oh, never shop
when you're hungry,\\
228 - 'cause you'll end up at home
with 15 Salisbury steaks.\\
229 - Give me those.\\
230 - See, the problem is,
I have a daughter at home.\\
231 - I think I'm gonna have
to start feeding her.\\
232 - I don't think I can do this.\\
233 - Of course you can't.
Lucky for you, I'm here.\\
234 - Now we just gotta find everything
you need to make a meat loaf.\\
235 - Wow, you're gonna
make me a meatloaf?\\
236 - No. You're gonna
make me a meatloaf.\\
237 - Okay, but sometimes
I burn myself on the oven.\\
238 - - I'm, uh... I'm Bob.
- Joanne.\\
239 - Now haul ass, Bob.\\
240 - - Oh.
- Oh.\\
241 - Sorry. Sorry. Oh, Donna.
Oh. Oh.\\
242 - So are you having
fun at the big ball?\\
243 - Um, yeah.
You know, at first I wasn't.\\
244 - - Eric was being
really jerky and weird.
- Uh-huh.\\
245 - Well, he does that.\\
246 - I mean, if he gets me
a glass of punch,\\
247 - it's not like we
have to sleep together.\\
248 - Well, it would have to be
pretty good punch.\\
249 - They have an open bar.\\
250 - Oh, I just wish
Eric could relax.\\
251 - Well, I think he can.\\
252 - Oh! Oh!\\
253 - Oh, good for him.
I'm... I'm glad.\\
254 - He's dancing with
a beautiful skank!\\
255 - Well, I will say
this about Price Mart.\\
256 - They have wonderful balls.\\
257 - Red, grab that centerpiece.\\
258 - Oh! Hey, here's another.\\
259 - Donna, honey,
grab that centerpiece.\\
260 - Kitty, how many centerpieces
do we need?\\
261 - Red, they are centerpieces!\\
262 - - Okay, so don't lose
my number, all right?
- All right.\\
263 - Eric, what the hell?\\
264 - - What?
- Why are you kissing her?\\
265 - - You're on a date with me.
- It wasn't a date.\\
266 - Well, it is now, you bastard!\\
267 - Now come open my car door
for me before I kick your ass!\\
268 - The Fotohut's cool.\\
269 - Hyde, your job kicks ass.\\
270 - Yeah. I never thought
I'd be a workingman, man.\\
271 - But, man, here I am,\\
272 - working for the man.\\
273 - Do you know what, man?\\
274 - I like the man.\\
275 - Hey, thanks, man.\\
276 - So, my probation officer
was sure happy I came by.\\
277 - He even wants to see me
for some additional years.\\
278 - He's a good guy.\\
279 - Ugly, fat, whore-y, old,\\
280 - whore-y, old, four-eyes,
ugly, fat.\\
281 - Oh, this one's kind of cute.\\
282 - I mean, for a fatty.\\
283 - Ahhh!\\
284 - I mean, for a whore?\\
285 - God damn, Jackie!
What do you want me to say?\\
286 - That's it.
I cannot work like this.\\
287 - Anyone who doesn't
have to be here must leave.\\
288 - - Fez.
- I said, leave.\\
289 - Damn, Fez. You've
only been here one day\\
290 - and you're already trying
to change everything.\\
291 - Yeah. It's like we crossed
into some different dimension\\
292 - where we're in some kind of\\
293 - Fotohut.\\
294 - It's eerie, man.\\
295 - And then you encourage him
and what happens?\\
296 - He ends up kissing a girl while
he's on a date with another girl.\\
297 - Once again, an open bar spells
disaster for the Forman family.\\
298 - Red, I am not drunk.\\
299 - I am upset\\
300 - and drunk.\\
301 - All I know is, that is not
the way to behave on a date.\\
302 - - It wasn't a date!
- It wasn't a date!\\
303 - - Oh, please.
- Oh, please.\\
304 - Good morning.\\
305 - No. It was morning when
I got here, on time.\\
306 - Now put this on.\\
307 - Clever, huh? Yes, very.\\
308 - Fez,\\
309 - working here is
about goofing off.\\
310 - You know, creating a model
of inefficiency.\\
311 - You're ruining the Fotohut, man.\\
312 - And if you think I'm
gonna stand idly by,\\
313 - you're right,
'cause that's what I do here.\\
314 - Oh, Hyde, you're here early.\\
315 - Oh, slick uniform, man.\\
316 - Is that how you spell Fotohut?\\
317 - Yes, but Hyde won't wear it.\\
318 - Something's gotta change
around here, man.\\
319 - Amen.\\
320 - I don't like what's
going on here, man.\\
321 - That little dude's
making us all look bad.\\
322 - I'm afraid the boss
is gonna fire me.\\
323 - Leo, you are the boss.\\
324 - Did you fire him yet?
I'll take his shifts.\\
325 - Hey, dude, man,\\
326 - I think we decided
that you're fired.\\
327 - Oh.\\
328 - Well, that's a cold slap
in the groin.\\
329 - How am I supposed to afford
my new boots?\\
330 - Here. Just do what I do, man.\\
331 - Just get some money out of the
register when the boss isn't looking.\\
332 - Once again, Leo,
you are the boss.\\
333 - And I'm not looking.\\
334 - - Hey, kissy-face.
- Ah. Well,\\
335 - if it isn't\\
336 - Kooky McShrimp-lover,\\
337 - who doesn't know how she feels\\
338 - coming over here like everything's
normal and nothing happened last night.\\
339 - Yep, that's my
Kooky McShrimp-lover.\\
340 - I know.
I freaked out. I'm sorry.\\
341 - Well, that's a first.\\
342 - Well, this is complicated, okay?\\
343 - I mean, we do
wanna be friends, right?\\
344 - Yeah.
I don't wanna be nothing.\\
345 - Okay. Well, then,
maybe some rules will help.\\
346 - Like, when we're out on a date
that's not a date,\\
347 - we can't make out
with slutty girls.\\
348 - Or that could just be
a rule for me.\\
349 - Yeah, I mean, Donna, feel
free... No, feel encouraged\\
350 - to make out with all
the slutty girls you want.\\
351 - What is this? Is this...\\
352 - Kissy-girl's phone number?\\
353 - Uh-huh.\\
354 - Okay, see you.\\
355 - Ew.\\
356 - Ahhh!\\
357 - I got it. Her phone
number is 7-2-9-3-6.\\
358 - I think there are a couple
more numbers than that.\\
359 - Really? Oh, yeah.\\
360 - It's 7-2-9-3-6,\\
361 - ampersand?\\
362 - Maybe, but I just don't
really know how to dial that.\\
363 - You just...\\
364 - Oh, yeah. That'd be hard.
\subsection {Episode 08: Donna's Story}
1 - Oh, Wanda.\\
2 - Oh, Derek.\\
3 - Oh, Wanda.\\
4 - Yes, Derek?\\
5 - You're not just my
next-door neighbor.\\
6 - You're also the love of my life.\\
7 - Derek, I, too, have strong
feelings of love for you.\\
8 - But I have to give back
this promise ball and chain.\\
9 - I must leave
Point Upon The Place\\
10 - and explore the world with my
trusty cat named Sir Bonkers.\\
11 - No.\\
12 - I'll never let you go.\\
13 - You can't make me stay.\\
14 - Oh, no?\\
15 - Well, what if
I told you that I've\\
16 - run over the cat
named Sir Bonkers\\
17 - and the cat named Sir Bonkers
is no more?\\
18 - Now submit and be my wife!\\
19 - Derek, once you were
a kind, peaceful man.\\
20 - But love has made you wicked.\\
21 - Oh, I am wicked.\\
22 - And until you
agree to be my wife,\\
23 - I will scour the earth in search
of cats named Sir Bonkers,\\
24 - and I will kill them all!\\
25 - Or, at very least,
spray them with water,\\
26 - which everyone knows they hate.\\
27 - I can't believe Donna would
publish this in the school paper.\\
28 - I know. This could be
in Reader's Digest.\\
29 - It's that good.\\
30 - Oh, this is
the worst short story\\
31 - by an ex-girlfriend
in the school newspaper ever.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - We're all all right\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
41 - Well, if it isn't
Playboy reading,\\
42 - panty-loving, cat-killing Derek.\\
43 - I know.
How could Donna write this?\\
44 - Why are you upset?\\
45 - It's this Derek guy
who really gets the shaft.\\
46 - Fez, I am Derek.\\
47 - Everything always
has to be about you.\\
48 - Fez, man, think about it.\\
49 - Eric killed Donna's cat.
Derek killed Wanda's cat.\\
50 - Donna found panties
in Eric's Vista Cruiser.\\
51 - Wanda found a chastity belt
in Derek's Vista Carriage.\\
52 - Hey, you guys,\\
53 - you know what goes really
good with a bad short story?\\
54 - Pinball!\\
55 - No. I hate pinball.\\
56 - Hate it or love it?\\
57 - Hate it.\\
58 - Or love it?\\
59 - Come on, guys. I'm gonna
buy a $50 stake in this machine,\\
60 - so let's play so I
can make some money.\\
61 - Where'd you get $50?\\
62 - From Jackie.\\
63 - Hey, Jackie.
Uh, can I borrow $50?\\
64 - For what?\\
65 - To buy a dress for you.\\
66 - Okay.\\
67 - Wait a minute.\\
68 - Eric, Derek.\\
69 - Panties, chastity belt.\\
70 - Dead cat, dead cat.\\
71 - Oh!\\
72 - I still got nothing.\\
73 - Come on, Red.\\
74 - Bob really wants us to meet
his new lady friend.\\
75 - Now, think about it, Kitty.\\
76 - She likes Bob.\\
77 - I have a hard time believing
this woman even exists.\\
78 - We're gonna get over there,\\
79 - Bob's gonna be
sitting in a rocker,\\
80 - with a lady's wig on.\\
81 - "You look
lovely tonight, Bob."\\
82 - "So do you, Bob."\\
83 - You've been working on
that all day, haven't you?\\
84 - Yeah.\\
85 - Red, Kitty, I'd like you to meet
a very special lady, Joanne.\\
86 - Well, Joanne,
it is so nice to meet you.\\
87 - Right, Red?\\
88 - We can't stay long.\\
89 - Ah, Red.\\
90 - Bob warned me you can be
a pain in the ass.\\
91 - Well, I'll tell you what.
We'll just have dinner,\\
92 - and if it turns out
you don't like me,\\
93 - we'll never
invite you over again.\\
94 - Really? I like you already.\\
95 - Well, let's get
this barbecue started.\\
96 - Bob, grab that meat.\\
97 - Oh, I got it, Red.
Why don't you fellas\\
98 - make a salad?\\
99 - Salad.\\
100 - Oh, you're serious?\\
101 - No, see,
Bob and I do the grilling.\\
102 - Not this time.\\
103 - Kitty, you wanna give me a hand?\\
104 - Well, I'd love to.
Oh, I don't think...\\
105 - But, Kitty, you might...\\
106 - set your lovely hair on fire.\\
107 - Well, it can't be that hard.
You do it.\\
108 - Bob, what
the hell's going on here?\\
109 - Look, Red,
I really like this woman.\\
110 - So please,
for today, just shut it.\\
111 - Shut it?\\
112 - Good God, Bob!\\
113 - Is she teaching you
to stand up for yourself?\\
114 - Yes.
Well, cut it out!\\
115 - I wanna have a nice time.
Come on.\\
116 - I'll give you first
dibs on the aprons.\\
117 - You want the fake tuxedo
or the fake hairy chest?\\
118 - Oh, damn it.\\
119 - Gimme the tuxedo!\\
120 - Hairy chest is
Joanne's favorite.\\
121 - It's probably
'cause she's got one.\\
122 - Oh, well, if it isn't the
wielder of the poison pen.\\
123 - Didn't you like my story?\\
124 - No. No, I didn't.\\
125 - That's why I said
"poison pen," not...\\
126 - "marshmallow pen."\\
127 - What?\\
128 - This story is about us.\\
129 - No, it's not.\\
130 - You took stuff from our life
and put them in your story.\\
131 - Like the time you found
those Playboys under my bed.\\
132 - Be gone, Sir Bonkers.\\
133 - Derek, look what I
found under your bed.\\
134 - Lewd renderings
of naked serving wenches.\\
135 - Did you commission these?\\
136 - So what if I did?
I have needs, woman.\\
137 - Now, ready thyself.
On this night, we fornicate.\\
138 - Okay, well, maybe
there are some similarities.\\
139 - But that's what writers do.\\
140 - I mean, we take
stuff from our lives.\\
141 - Yeah, but you made me mean
all the time and that's mean.\\
142 - Okay, maybe I
exaggerate some stuff,\\
143 - 'cause, you know,
I'm writing this\\
144 - for stupid high school girls.\\
145 - Oh, my God! Great story!\\
146 - Michael!\\
147 - Steven just told me that
instead of buying me a dress,\\
148 - you spent my $50 on
this stupid machine.\\
149 - Jackie, I did not.\\
150 - Oh, yeah, I did.\\
151 - Jackie, listen.
There's an old saying,\\
152 - "You buy a girl a dress,\\
153 - "and she looks
pretty for one night.\\
154 - "But you buy her boyfriend
a pinball machine,\\
155 - "and she
looks pretty for life."\\
156 - Okay, there's another
old saying, Michael.\\
157 - You're dumb as dirt.\\
158 - That's true.
That was in the yearbook.\\
159 - Okay, okay.
All right. Listen, listen.\\
160 - So, I bought a half stake
in this machine, all right?\\
161 - So that means for every
quarter I put into it,\\
162 - I get half back.\\
163 - That's a 50% profit!\\
164 - Uh, actually, Kelso,
I think that's a 50% loss.\\
165 - Fez, I know it's
hard for a foreigner\\
166 - to understand our
complicated capitalist system.\\
167 - But we're dealing with quarters
here, not frogs or chickens.\\
168 - Well, I'm not going to
dignify that with a response.\\
169 - Because I can't think of one.\\
170 - But when I do,
a good day to you.\\
171 - All right, Fez.\\
172 - I said, kiss my ass.\\
173 - So, you still mad?\\
174 - No. No reason to be mad.\\
175 - Your story is just a pathetic
attempt to rewrite history,\\
176 - make yourself look good.\\
177 - I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna
know who the dill-hole is here.\\
178 - Eric, it's just a story.\\
179 - No one's gonna think
anybody's a dill-hole.\\
180 - Cat killer.
Bastard.\\
181 - Porn freak.\\
182 - Okay, they could be talking
about anybody.\\
183 - Hey, we're all
porn-freak bastards,\\
184 - but he's the only
one who killed a cat.\\
185 - Okay, okay.\\
186 - This school
obviously needs to hear\\
187 - the Eric Forman
version of things,\\
188 - a.k.a. the truth.\\
189 - So I'm gonna write my own story.\\
190 - Yeah. Yeah, that's right.\\
191 - I'm throwing down
the gauntlet, baby.\\
192 - Really?\\
193 - Okay, smarty,
what's a "gauntlet"?\\
194 - A "gauntlet"?
What's a "gauntlet"?\\
195 - What's a "gauntlet"?\\
196 - I don't know,
but it's down, lady.\\
197 - Boy, this chicken's delish.
What a chef.\\
198 - You really know
your way around a grill, Joanne.\\
199 - Mine's dry.\\
200 - No, it isn't.
It's tender and delicious.\\
201 - Maybe if I chewed
it with some water.\\
202 - Well, there's the hose.\\
203 - I don't like her anymore.\\
204 - Well, I do.\\
205 - Kitty, I'm chopping vegetables,\\
206 - Bob's telling me to shut it,\\
207 - you're over there grilling
with Susan B. Damn Anthony.\\
208 - Well, fine, Red.\\
209 - If it bothers you,
we can invite them over,\\
210 - and you can do the grilling.\\
211 - But for now,
I'd really appreciate it\\
212 - if you'd just shut it.\\
213 - If one more person
tells me to shut it...\\
214 - What?
You might actually shut it?\\
215 - Please, Wanda, you
don't have to boil me alive.\\
216 - Killing your cat
was just a horrible accident.\\
217 - I know, but I'm a witch.\\
218 - Dear God, why is a nice,
sensitive guy like me\\
219 - dating a lying, manipulative
witch like you?\\
220 - Well, maybe it's because
even witches have itches.\\
221 - All is forgiven!\\
222 - God, why do all my
stories end like that?\\
223 - Don't stop.
I like where you were going.\\
224 - All right, guys. It is time
to make a withdrawal\\
225 - from the First
National Bank of Pinball.\\
226 - Oh, man. No one's playing.\\
227 - Well, I would've played,\\
228 - but my frogs and chickens
wouldn't fit into the slot.\\
229 - All right. I know
what the problem is here.\\
230 - This thing has been here
for so long that\\
231 - people have forgotten about it.\\
232 - I just need to advertise.\\
233 - So, Jackie, put on a bikini\\
234 - and stand in front
of the machine.\\
235 - Michael, I am not wearing a
bikini in here. It would cause a riot.\\
236 - Okay, what if
I just put up flyers\\
237 - with a picture of
you in a bikini?\\
238 - Yeah, okay. I mean,
it'll still draw a crowd,\\
239 - but at least
they'll remain orderly.\\
240 - Okay, so I just need
some Magic Markers\\
241 - and a picture of you
in a bikini.\\
242 - Oh. I have one.\\
243 - Keep it. I have plenty.\\
244 - So, guys, check out my story.\\
245 - I passed out a bunch of copies
at lunch today.\\
246 - Oh, Forman, this kind of thing
always blows up in your face.\\
247 - Don't ever stop doing it.\\
248 - What the hell is this?\\
249 - Oh, you didn't like my story?\\
250 - Oh, yeah, I loved it.
Especially this part.\\
251 - Wanda, I have performed every
task thou hath asketh of me.\\
252 - Please, can we finally
consummate our love?\\
253 - I beseech you.\\
254 - Well, I said I would.
So I won't.\\
255 - But, I beseeched you.\\
256 - Okay, let's consummate.\\
257 - Really?
No.\\
258 - Please. I beseech you.\\
259 - Okay.\\
260 - Really?
No.\\
261 - Now, rub my enormous feet.\\
262 - Um, guys, I don't understand.
What does "consummate" mean?\\
263 - It means to have sex.\\
264 - Really?\\
265 - Now I have two words for that.\\
266 - Eric, you just
wrote this to hurt me.\\
267 - What? I did not.
And, hey, so did you.\\
268 - Look, when I wrote my story,\\
269 - I just sat down
and that's what came out.\\
270 - I didn't, like,
plan it or anything.\\
271 - And besides...
No, you know what?\\
272 - I don't have to
explain myself to you.\\
273 - Okay, I'd like
someone to explain it to me.\\
274 - Well, that's easy, Fez.\\
275 - See, Donna, as an artist,\\
276 - wrote her story to get some
perspective on her life.\\
277 - And Forman, as a vindictive ass,\\
278 - wrote his story to
be a vindictive ass.\\
279 - Oh, Eric, I think you just
consummated yourself.\\
280 - See what I did there?
Looks easy, but it's not.\\
281 - Well, steaks are a-cooking.\\
282 - Mmm.\\
283 - Ah! What should we have
to go with dinner?\\
284 - Oh, I know. How about a salad?\\
285 - Say, Joanne,
why don't you make the salad?\\
286 - No, thanks.\\
287 - Aw.\\
288 - Make the salad.\\
289 - Unless you don't
like to do lady jobs.\\
290 - Red, put this in your mouth.\\
291 - Okay, you know what?
I'll make the salad.\\
292 - Sit down, Bob.\\
293 - I'd love to make a salad.\\
294 - Great.\\
295 - As soon as Red admits he's
not asking me to make a salad,\\
296 - he's trying to
put me in my place.\\
297 - You are woman.
I hear you roar.\\
298 - I can't believe
you're so threatened\\
299 - by something as trivial as
me grilling chicken.\\
300 - It's not trivial. Men grill.\\
301 - It's been that way
since the first caveman\\
302 - bonked a woolly
mammoth on the head\\
303 - and threw it on the barbecue.\\
304 - And his cave
wife made the salad.\\
305 - I smell something burning.\\
306 - Oh, darn!\\
307 - Well, if you didn't
want it well-done,\\
308 - you should've said something.\\
309 - What the hell?\\
310 - Where's my pinball machine?\\
311 - Oh, where, indeed?\\
312 - Oh...\\
313 - I remember.\\
314 - I convinced the owner\\
315 - that pinball was out
and Space Invaders was in.\\
316 - Fez, why would you stab me
in the back like that?\\
317 - Well, rest assured, Kelso, your
frogs and chickens comment\\
318 - had nothing to do with it.\\
319 - Well, why then?\\
320 - Hey, Eric, we're sorry\\
321 - we called you a cat-killer
bastard porn freak.\\
322 - Oh, so, you read my story, huh?\\
323 - No, we read part
two of Donna's story.\\
324 - The ending is so beautiful.\\
325 - Part... Huh?\\
326 - What?\\
327 - "And as Wanda walked away,
she knew in her heart\\
328 - "she would never
stop loving Derek."\\
329 - Wow, that's good writing.\\
330 - It's emotional
and it screws you.\\
331 - Hey.\\
332 - Hey, so, uh, funny thing.\\
333 - Um, your story had
a second part, huh?\\
334 - Yeah, the paper broke it in
half, 'cause it was too long.\\
335 - Oh.\\
336 - Well, you know,\\
337 - maybe my story has
a second part, too.\\
338 - Eric, your story ended with,\\
339 - "And he never saw
that crazy bitch again."\\
340 - Well, you know,
that was just a prequel.\\
341 - To a story entitled,\\
342 - uh, "He did see that crazy bitch
again and she was a delight."\\
343 - Okay, I was pretty
mad when I wrote that.\\
344 - Eric, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings,\\
345 - but, I mean, I guess I was mad
when I wrote mine, too.\\
346 - At least when I started.\\
347 - But once I got
all that stuff off my chest,\\
348 - I mean, I felt better about us.\\
349 - More like
the second half of my story.\\
350 - So, uh...\\
351 - So, what happens
to Derek and Wanda?\\
352 - Well, in the story, they went
off on their own adventures.\\
353 - Yeah.\\
354 - Yeah, I mean, that's,
that's probably good for them.\\
355 - Yeah.\\
356 - - It's probably time
they moved on.
- Sure.\\
357 - Derek's gonna be fine.\\
358 - He's a smart guy.\\
359 - The wenches love him.\\
360 - Yeah, well,
Wanda's gonna do great, too.\\
361 - Oh, yeah, sure.\\
362 - And she'll get all
the wenches she wants.\\
363 - Oh, my God,
Donna, there's your story.\\
364 - "Wanda and the dirty wenches."\\
365 - Shut up.\\
366 - I know. I know.\\
367 - That's a movie.\\
368 - Oh, Fez,\\
369 - I can't hold my feelings
inside any longer.\\
370 - Yes, we must finally tell you
how much we desire you.\\
371 - And it's not just us, Fez.\\
372 - Oh, I knew it all along.\\
373 - Now let's consummate me.\\
374 - Oh, boy.\\
375 - This is the best story ever.
\subsection {Episode 09: Forgotten Son}
1 - Well, here are my boys.
How was work?\\
2 - Oh, you know, just another day\\
3 - of restocking upper Point Place\\
4 - with durable household goods.
Sleep soundly, Wisconsin.\\
5 - I got some big news from the
Price Mart home office.\\
6 - Ooh! They finally
gonna let you\\
7 - physically discipline
the workers?\\
8 - - No, but I still have
a free hand at home.
- Right.\\
9 - Headquarters is having
every manager\\
10 - make a departmental
training film.\\
11 - And they picked me
for the stockroom.\\
12 - Stockroom. Wow!\\
13 - Yeah.\\
14 - Steve from Oshkosh
got ice-and-snow management.\\
15 - Loser.\\
16 - Well, Red, that is wonderful.\\
17 - Yeah, I know.\\
18 - Every single
Price Mart stock boy\\
19 - will be trained in
the Red Forman way.\\
20 - Oh, you mean,
undermining their self-esteem\\
21 - until they're too
weak to fight back?\\
22 - You know, if you would just
zip it for a second,\\
23 - you might be
interested in hearing\\
24 - who I want to play
the stock boy.\\
25 - Oh, look, Dad,
I appreciate the thought...\\
26 - I'm gonna use this idiot!\\
27 - All right!\\
28 - Hanging out\\
29 - Down the street\\
30 - The same old thing\\
31 - We did last week\\
32 - Not a thing to do\\
33 - But talk to you\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
37 - Man, I guess my movie career\\
38 - is getting started
sooner than I thought.\\
39 - Kelso's playing the stock boy?\\
40 - This is my favorite thing ever.\\
41 - Well, Michael does have
marvelous bone structure.\\
42 - Oh, but you will too,
honey, once you fill out.\\
43 - Oh, man. Mom burn!\\
44 - Yep.\\
45 - That's twice the normal burn.\\
46 - Dad, how can you choose Kelso\\
47 - to play the
Price Mart stock boy?\\
48 - You have a better suggestion?\\
49 - Hello!\\
50 - I am a Price Mart stock boy.\\
51 - I just came from
stocking at Price Mart.\\
52 - And I am currently wearing
a Price Mart stock boy smock.\\
53 - Good point, Eric.
Give your smock to Kelso.\\
54 - Oh, I don't think my broad,
photogenic shoulders\\
55 - are gonna fit in
that little thing.\\
56 - Now, don't take
this personal, Son.\\
57 - You're just too
twitchy and skinny.\\
58 - Well, you know,
the camera adds 10 pounds.\\
59 - Yeah, 10. Not 40.\\
60 - How could he pick Kelso
to play the stock boy?\\
61 - I'm the one with the acting
experience, remember?\\
62 - I was mushroom number two
in Alice in Wonderland.\\
63 - But you were mushroom
number one in my heart.\\
64 - Hey.\\
65 - Oh, hey. What's up?\\
66 - We're going to lunch.\\
67 - We're going to lunch?\\
68 - Well, actually, honey,
we're going to lunch.\\
69 - You and I are going to lunch?\\
70 - Well, no.\\
71 - You and Donna and I
are going to lunch?\\
72 - Well, almost, honey.\\
73 - You and Donna
are going to lunch?\\
74 - Nothing gets past you, Einstein.\\
75 - I don't think I like
the idea of you two\\
76 - going out to lunch together.\\
77 - Well, what if we bring
you back a sandwich?\\
78 - Well, a sandwich isn't gonna
make me feel better, Mom.\\
79 - Okay, then. We're leaving.\\
80 - Well, in that case,
I would like a sandwich.\\
81 - Yeah, I don't like this day.\\
82 - Hey, dudes.\\
83 - Hey, Leo man,\\
84 - Huggy Bear called.
He wants his suit back.\\
85 - Huggy Bear?\\
86 - This is my suit, man.\\
87 - So, to what do we
owe the fancy pants?\\
88 - Great news, man.\\
89 - I inherited a million bucks
from my dead uncle.\\
90 - Shut up.
No way.\\
91 - It's true.
So, come on,\\
92 - let's share the wealth!\\
93 - Come on, I'll buy
you anything you want.\\
94 - Does that include burgers
and nudie mags?\\
95 - Include?
That's half the budget, man.\\
96 - Eric, have you seen Donna?\\
97 - She was supposed to help me
sort out my daytime cosmetics\\
98 - from my nighttime cosmetics,
but she never showed up.\\
99 - Oh, you haven't heard?\\
100 - Donna's got a new friend.\\
101 - And I, for one,
think it's time you met her.\\
102 - Donna, what are you doing?\\
103 - We invented a new cookie.\\
104 - It's a variation of
the snickerdoodle.\\
105 - We're calling it
the "Donnakitty."\\
106 - Or the "Ditty."\\
107 - We haven't decided.\\
108 - Donna, you're supposed to be
sorting, as in my cosmetics.\\
109 - Oh, yeah.
I'm real sorry I missed that.\\
110 - It started as an annoying,
but innocent lunch.\\
111 - And now they're inventing
cookies. It's growing, man.\\
112 - It's the freaking Blob.\\
113 - Donna, why do you
need a new friend?\\
114 - Haven't I always
been there for you?\\
115 - Uh, no.\\
116 - I hope your cookies burn!\\
117 - Eric, old people
and young people\\
118 - are not supposed to
spend time together.\\
119 - It's unnatural.\\
120 - What am I
supposed to do about it?\\
121 - Well, you better do something.\\
122 - You know what girls talk about
when they get together.\\
123 - Um...\\
124 - Sugar and spice
and everything nice?\\
125 - That's what we're
made of, you dumb ass.\\
126 - They talk about men,
and that would be you.\\
127 - Well, barely.\\
128 - You know,
you could really use a refill\\
129 - on the "everything nice."\\
130 - You know,\\
131 - I wasn't that worried about Donna
and my mom talking about me,\\
132 - but now that I'm all paranoid,
I'm all, like,\\
133 - paranoid.\\
134 - I mean, when did it become
okay for them to be friends?\\
135 - Right after your father
replaced you\\
136 - with a semi-literate,
pretty boy.\\
137 - That's me.\\
138 - So, I've been thinking about
great actors to model myself after,\\
139 - and I choose Travolta.\\
140 - Kelso,\\
141 - I can think of no better way
to impress Red\\
142 - than by acting like Travolta
in his industrial film.\\
143 - Bravo, man.\\
144 - That is good advice.\\
145 - Man...\\
146 - I don't want Donna and my mom
talking about me.\\
147 - Yeah and Donna's a big mouth.\\
148 - Like, she told me how you wore
makeup to last year's class picture.\\
149 - What?\\
150 - I did not.\\
151 - I had a zit.
Stop looking at me.\\
152 - Forman,\\
153 - you and I are both victims
of parental abandonment.\\
154 - Luckily, I have
a rich hippie benefactor.\\
155 - He bought me nudie mags
I'd never even heard of.\\
156 - "Yeah, I'll stock this shelf!\\
157 - "But someday\\
158 - "I'm gonna dance
across this whole city."\\
159 - That's dead-on.\\
160 - Okay, we need to talk.\\
161 - It's about,
shall we say, your new crowd.\\
162 - And don't even pretend you and
Donna aren't talking about me.\\
163 - 'Cause I know
what's going on here,\\
164 - and it goes a little
something like this...\\
165 - Oh, honey,
you look wonderful.\\
166 - Say, can we look at\\
167 - Eric's naked
baby pictures again?\\
168 - They're right here!\\
169 - My, you could tell even then
he'd always be small.\\
170 - Yeah, he really is tiny.\\
171 - It's not satisfying.\\
172 - Well, how could it be, dear?\\
173 - But at least he's nice.\\
174 - Yeah, he's nice.\\
175 - Yeah, he's nice...\\
176 - For a nancy boy!\\
177 - So, what do you say to that?\\
178 - All right, now, Kelso.\\
179 - You'll just go through a few
typical stock boy tasks\\
180 - while I firmly,
but kindly, oversee you.\\
181 - Got it.
All right. Let's get started.\\
182 - Kelso.\\
183 - What the hell are you doing?\\
184 - Oh, see, I'm going for
a Travolta thing.\\
185 - Okay, my character's
actually a dancer\\
186 - who's just stocking shelves
until he makes it big.\\
187 - All right, all right, let me
paint a picture for you.\\
188 - Just close your eyes.\\
189 - Okay,
imagine with your eyes open.\\
190 - Just come with me.\\
191 - Just stack the cans, moron.\\
192 - But why am I stacking cans?\\
193 - See, I'm thinking that the
manager is a bad guy.\\
194 - So, why would I
stack cans for him?\\
195 - Because if you
don't stack the cans,\\
196 - the manager is
going to kill you.\\
197 - Oh! So I'm afraid for my life.\\
198 - That works. All right,
let's act.\\
199 - Oh, no. You're alone.\\
200 - Where's your
little buddy, Skipper?\\
201 - Okay, sweetie.\\
202 - My friendship with Donna
is making you uncomfortable,\\
203 - so I'm gonna call it off.\\
204 - Really?
Mmm-hmm.\\
205 - Well, thank you.\\
206 - Maybe some of your loyalty
will rub off on Dad.\\
207 - Oh. Don't let that bother you.\\
208 - Michael may have
movie-star good looks,\\
209 - but you are much, much smarter
than he is.\\
210 - Okay, why couldn't you have
said that in front of everyone\\
211 - instead of how great
Kelso's bone structure is?\\
212 - I don't want to
make anybody feel bad.\\
213 - Well, good job.\\
214 - All right, guys, let's shop!\\
215 - Thanks again, Leo.\\
216 - Yes, thank you.\\
217 - You know what would make
this outfit perfect?\\
218 - A cockatoo.\\
219 - Then we'll get a cockatoo,
or three.\\
220 - Hey, Red, listen,\\
221 - I got this great new idea I want
to lay on you about our movie.\\
222 - Dad, I've heard this idea,\\
223 - and speaking as
an unbiased observer\\
224 - with no score to settle...\\
225 - ...it is great. Go!\\
226 - Kelso, you don't
get to have ideas.\\
227 - Dad, if I could just interject.\\
228 - This idea will literally change
industrial filmdom forever.\\
229 - Go get them, Kelso. Go!\\
230 - Okay.\\
231 - The stock boy\\
232 - has a love interest.
No.\\
233 - Now, before you say no,\\
234 - I already found
the perfect person.\\
235 - Oh, stock boy, I love you!\\
236 - No. Get out.\\
237 - Okay, um...\\
238 - Eric's uncomfortable\\
239 - because he thinks we talk
about him, which we don't.\\
240 - Although that story about him\\
241 - wearing makeup to his
class pictures was a hoot.\\
242 - But I guess what I'm saying
is, um...\\
243 - we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.\\
244 - But it's been so
nice having someone\\
245 - to talk to since my mom left.\\
246 - I know.\\
247 - Someone who understands
what I'm going through.\\
248 - Oh, honey.\\
249 - Someone to make
banana bread with.\\
250 - I ate that for dinner
three nights in a row.\\
251 - Oh, you poor, sweet girl.\\
252 - What the hell?\\
253 - Boy, being a
millionaire is great.\\
254 - Well, at least you put
the money to good use.\\
255 - Fun Tart?\\
256 - Don't mind if I do.
Candy Button?\\
257 - I've got a million of them.\\
258 - So, Leo, man,
tell us about your Uncle Ed.\\
259 - Why'd he leave
you all his money?\\
260 - Check it out, man. It's
all in this letter he sent me.\\
261 - Your Uncle Ed is Ed McMahon?\\
262 - Yeah.\\
263 - Who knew I was Scottish?\\
264 - Damn, Leo, you
didn't inherit $1 million.\\
265 - That's a sweepstakes contest.\\
266 - Well, then who has my money?\\
267 - There is no money,
you son of a bitch!\\
268 - Oh.\\
269 - Wow. I guess all this
stuff has to go back.\\
270 - Oh, that means you, too,
Feathery Frank.\\
271 - Good day.
But, Fez...\\
272 - I said, good day.\\
273 - I'm
leaving Brooklyn, Mr. Formanelli.\\
274 - And when I get to Manhattan,
I'm gonna be a star.\\
275 - So, what do you think?\\
276 - You're fired.\\
277 - You.\\
278 - Price Mart
is only as strong\\
279 - as its weakest stock boy.\\
280 - Just look at what one
well-trained worker can accomplish.\\
281 - Neat, efficient, organized.
The Price Mart way.\\
282 - And each job completed\\
283 - with that award-winning
Price Mart attitude.\\
284 - Remember, you can't spell
stock boy without...\\
285 - "Oh, boy!"\\
286 - Perfect.\\
287 - Well, who would have thought
a stock boy would do a good job\\
288 - playing a stock boy?\\
289 - Yeah, I mean,
it's a topsy-turvy world.\\
290 - Yeah. You did a good job.\\
291 - Wait a minute.\\
292 - Are you proud of me?\\
293 - No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't say that.\\
294 - So, do we hug now?\\
295 - Men don't hug.\\
296 - My daddy loves me.\\
297 - Shut it.\\
298 - I love you, too, Daddy.\\
299 - Oh, well, look who's here.\\
300 - Do a little shopping, ladies?\\
301 - Well, it's not like
I can take my dad shopping.\\
302 - I mean, every time a saleslady
brings over some underwear,\\
303 - he gets embarrassed and goes,
"Whoo-hoo!"\\
304 - So, I suppose you have
something snarky to say about that.\\
305 - You know what?\\
306 - I don't.\\
307 - Really?
No.\\
308 - Look, your mom\\
309 - can't take you shopping,
so, you know what?\\
310 - It's cool with me
if you guys want to hang out.\\
311 - Honey, I am so
glad you understand.\\
312 - Yeah, Eric, thanks.\\
313 - Yeah.\\
314 - Yeah, just, look, please,
no talking about me, okay?\\
315 - And no looking at my naked
baby pictures, either.\\
316 - They're misleading.\\
317 - Honey, I've already
seen you naked.\\
318 - Mom.\\
319 - Oh. And she's
already seen you naked!\\
320 - You know what?
From now on,\\
321 - that's all we should talk about.\\
322 - Okay. Leaving now.\\
323 - Okay, here he is on the potty.\\
324 - Look how hard
he's concentrating.\\
325 - Oh, ooh, I have
some earlier ones.\\
326 - Look at that baby.\\
327 - - Didn't he have
the cutest little behind?
- Yeah.\\
328 - So when did he lose it?\\
329 - Right around when he turned 10.\\
330 - It was the strangest thing.
Poof!\\
331 - Like someone ironed him.
\subsection {Episode 10: Red and Stacey}
1 - So, what are you boys
doing tonight?\\
2 - Well, this evening, Miss Big Rhonda
returns from the dirt farms of Mississippi.\\
3 - I am off to the bus station,\\
4 - and she will melt
into my loving arms.\\
5 - Well, you better wear a
raincoat, 'cause she ain't small.\\
6 - She is big, isn't she?\\
7 - Well, I'm taking this chick up to the
lake for some, you know, bird watching.\\
8 - Ooh, bird watching.\\
9 - I think me and Jackie are
going to go "bird watching," too.\\
10 - It's cool, 'cause they don't
know what we're talking about.\\
11 - Think they cracked it, Kelso.\\
12 - Well, I guess it's just us
three musketeers tonight, huh?\\
13 - "All for one
and one for all," right?\\
14 - Well, actually,\\
15 - your father and I
were gonna do some reading.\\
16 - Upstairs.\\
17 - Together.\\
18 - What your mom's trying to
say is, "Go away for 20 minutes."\\
19 - Forty-five minutes, Red.\\
20 - - Thirty.
- Thirty-five.\\
21 - Fine. Get lost for 35 minutes.\\
22 - Fine.\\
23 - But you know what? I got
a little question for you.\\
24 - Why even have kids if you ain't
gonna spend any time with them?\\
25 - I suggest you use your 35
minutes to think about that.\\
26 - He needs a new girlfriend.\\
27 - Come on, Kitty.
You're on the clock.\\
28 - Oh, you know what?
Just turn off your clock.\\
29 - I'm gonna go talk to him.\\
30 - You can't turn off the clock!\\
31 - Oh, she doesn't
understand the clock.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - We're all all right\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
41 - Cocoa puff!\\
42 - Mashed potato!\\
43 - - What are you doing here?
- Well, I wanted to see you,\\
44 - because I wanted to
ask you something.\\
45 - - Would you go out with me
this Saturday?
- Oh, my God. 'Course I will!\\
46 - Can't\\
47 - breathe.\\
48 - It hurts.\\
49 - Ah, suck it up.\\
50 - Wow.\\
51 - Strong girl.\\
52 - Crap-alula.\\
53 - Fez just asked me out.\\
54 - I'm so nervous, and I left my
asthma puffer in Mississippi.\\
55 - I've never been on a real
date. What am I gonna wear?\\
56 - Who cares? You could be naked
with a welding hat\\
57 - and Fez would
still be all over you.\\
58 - Well, that sounds like fun.\\
59 - But I want it to be special.\\
60 - - You know what? We'll help you get ready.
- Really?\\
61 - Oh, that'd be great.
I wanna look pretty.\\
62 - Pretty?\\
63 - Oh, sweetie, maybe you can
learn some jokes or something.\\
64 - Look, dropout, this coupon says
20 cents off the athlete's foot cream.\\
65 - - So pay up!
- Is there a problem here?\\
66 - This sad little man has
fungusy feet but won't spend the 20...\\
67 - Stacy.\\
68 - Mr. Forman,
his coupon expired.\\
69 - Oh, that's all right.\\
70 - Here's your 20 cents.\\
71 - Now, you come again, huh?\\
72 - - Mushroom foot.
- Stacy.\\
73 - I'm sorry, Mr. Forman.\\
74 - It's just that
he's such a dumb ass.\\
75 - I like you.\\
76 - Hey, you know who I like?\\
77 - Nixon?\\
78 - Stacy, that cute new cashier
at work.\\
79 - You should ask her out.\\
80 - Sorry, Dad. I don't like to dip
my pen in the company ink.\\
81 - Well, I don't like you being
home three Fridays in a row.\\
82 - Look, if you don't have
the guts to talk to her,\\
83 - I'll pave the way.\\
84 - Hey. Listen, if anyone's
gonna talk to her, I'll talk to her.\\
85 - Well, then we know
no one's gonna talk to her.\\
86 - Hey, I might.\\
87 - You...\\
88 - You still like girls,
don't you, Son?\\
89 - No, Dad, they're yucky.\\
90 - Oh, my God.\\
91 - I know. She is seriously hot.\\
92 - No, not her. This KISS
alarm clock. Check it out.\\
93 - Wake up.\\
94 - Yeah, this I like.\\
95 - Forman, you have
a responsibility to all of us\\
96 - to find out
what's underneath that smock.\\
97 - I bet it's boobs.\\
98 - So, spying on her, huh?\\
99 - Well, that's mature.\\
100 - Why don't you just
pull her hair and run?\\
101 - - Yes, let's do that.
- All right. All right, all right.\\
102 - All right.\\
103 - All right, I'm gonna go do this.\\
104 - - Yeah, all right. I can't do this.
- Oh, jeez.\\
105 - - I'll go talk to her.
- No!\\
106 - What? Now you're gonna
start listening to me?\\
107 - Go! Grease the wheels, pal.\\
108 - Thanks for doing this.\\
109 - I know you guys'll
make me pretty and stuff.\\
110 - Rhonda, it's no problem.\\
111 - We'll just help you
pick some nice clothes.\\
112 - Clean clothes. And,\\
113 - maybe do your hair...\\
114 - Clean hair.\\
115 - Okay, the beauty ambulance
has arrived!\\
116 - So, first things first. Let's
get rid of those shoulder pads.\\
117 - What shoulder pads?\\
118 - Okay.\\
119 - So, Stacy, my son Eric
is about your age.\\
120 - And he's a real nice guy.\\
121 - Skinny, but nice.\\
122 - And I was thinking,\\
123 - the two of you should go out.\\
124 - What do you say?\\
125 - Well, I kind of
like someone else.\\
126 - Oh.\\
127 - Oh, no.\\
128 - Hey.\\
129 - - So, does she like me?
- Who?\\
130 - - Stacy.
- Who's Stacy?\\
131 - - She's not interested.
- She's not interested?\\
132 - How can she not be interested?
Who is she?\\
133 - See? I knew I shouldn't have
let you talk to her.\\
134 - Great. Now she thinks
I'm a freak.\\
135 - Oh, she doesn't think
you're a freak. Does she?\\
136 - Yes. Yes, she does.\\
137 - - You better
stay away from her.
- Well, your father's right.\\
138 - If anyone's a freak, she is.\\
139 - Did Stacy actually
use the word "freak"?\\
140 - Why don't you just let it go?\\
141 - Maybe the reason
girls don't like you\\
142 - is because you just
don't let things go!\\
143 - Stacy was saying
just that thing today.\\
144 - I'm gonna go take a bath.\\
145 - Well, now, who is this Stacy
who doesn't like my son?\\
146 - I have half a mind
to call her mother.\\
147 - I tried to set Eric up with
this pretty girl at work...\\
148 - Well, not pretty.\\
149 - Decent. Less ugly than most.\\
150 - Good enough for a young boy,\\
151 - but no man would be interested.\\
152 - Red, what are you talking about?\\
153 - Why can't anyone in this
family just let things go?\\
154 - Red, you're blushing.\\
155 - Don't tell me
she has a crush on you.\\
156 - - Kitty, I don't wanna
talk about it.
- Okay.\\
157 - So, do you\\
158 - like her back?\\
159 - Hi, Stacy.
Hi, I'm Eric Forman.\\
160 - Look, I feel a little silly about
my dad asking you out for me.\\
161 - You probably thought I was like,\\
162 - ugly or, slow or something.\\
163 - So I just wanted to say, "Hi."\\
164 - You know, give you
a chance to, you know,\\
165 - take a gander at the goods,
so to speak...\\
166 - And see if maybe tomorrow
night you wanted to have dinner?\\
167 - At your house?\\
168 - Will your dad be there?
'Cause I'll go if he's there.\\
169 - Okay.\\
170 - What, do you, like...\\
171 - Do you, like, like my dad?\\
172 - Oh, my God! You like my dad?\\
173 - Do you know
if he's seeing anyone?\\
174 - Yeah.\\
175 - My mom.\\
176 - And they bought
furniture together, so...\\
177 - Yeah, I think
it's pretty serious.\\
178 - Ladies sit up straight.\\
179 - Candy.\\
180 - - Jackie, she doesn't
have to sit like that.
- Yes, she does.\\
181 - - Stop doing that!
- You stop doing that!\\
182 - Hey! If I don't get a freaking
M&M, I'm gonna start swinging!\\
183 - You stay out of this.\\
184 - Jackie, try to be
more sensitive.\\
185 - Donna, I am not gonna send her
on her date looking like Sasquatch.\\
186 - Huh?\\
187 - She said
you're very pretty. "Atch."\\
188 - Hey, guys. I got news.\\
189 - Turns out
Stacy doesn't even like me.\\
190 - Yeah, we kind of expected that.\\
191 - I thought you said you had news.\\
192 - Well, yeah. Here it comes.\\
193 - She likes Red.\\
194 - Oh, my God!\\
195 - You're gonna have to leave town!\\
196 - - Why?
- 'Cause we're gonna
tell everyone!\\
197 - Tell me this. How'd the
50-year-old guy get the girl?\\
198 - Look at me.
I'm an attractive man.\\
199 - Well, I got you.\\
200 - Technically, I got you.\\
201 - And then you blew it.\\
202 - Which means you didn't
lose it, 'cause you never had it.\\
203 - See, there's your silver lining.\\
204 - Eric, you have a lot of good
qualities. I mean, you're funny. Like...\\
205 - Well, what just happened
to you is funny.\\
206 - Look, that chick likes Red
'cause he's a tough guy,\\
207 - a hard-ass.\\
208 - You? You're soft.\\
209 - How soft is he, Hyde?\\
210 - Softer than Liberace
at the Playboy Mansion.\\
211 - Yeah!\\
212 - 'Cause he plays piano.\\
213 - Wait.\\
214 - Oh!\\
215 - Burn!\\
216 - You guys kill me.\\
217 - Look.\\
218 - How come Red is such
a hard-ass, and I am so...\\
219 - I mean...\\
220 - Okay, when a bear has a baby,\\
221 - it's a little bear, right?\\
222 - My dad's a bear, but I'm like...\\
223 - A duck.\\
224 - Eric, you were a bear
when you were born,\\
225 - but Red pounded you into
the duck that we know and love.\\
226 - So, what are you saying?
It's Red's fault?\\
227 - Yeah. But the good news is,
as a duck,\\
228 - you can move more easily
through the water.\\
229 - And now,
back to Night of the Living Dead.\\
230 - Is everything okay
over there, Stacy?\\
231 - Come here, Mr. Forman.
I wanna show you something.\\
232 - Holy crap!\\
233 - You're a zombie!\\
234 - I want Red.\\
235 - Red. How could you?\\
236 - She's a sexy zombie!\\
237 - She overpowered me!\\
238 - I knew I couldn't trust you,
you cheater!\\
239 - Kitty!\\
240 - What the hell was that?\\
241 - Oh, Kitty.\\
242 - Oh, I need to talk to you.\\
243 - I just wanna say,\\
244 - with regard to this
Stacy thing...\\
245 - Look.\\
246 - I'm bound to attract
a certain amount of attention.\\
247 - I can't help that.\\
248 - - But I would never...
- Oh, Red. You wouldn't stray.\\
249 - You've got too much character.\\
250 - And who could blame her
for being interested?\\
251 - You're certainly interesting
to me.\\
252 - Really?\\
253 - Do you have some spare time?\\
254 - Why? Am I on the clock?\\
255 - I'm thinking 45 minutes.\\
256 - Oh.\\
257 - The scenic route.\\
258 - I give you the new Rhonda!\\
259 - First time in heels.\\
260 - So, where's Fez?\\
261 - Oh, he's nervous,
so he's in the "whoo-hoo."\\
262 - Have you been working on her
all night?\\
263 - She wouldn't even let me pee.\\
264 - I'd squash her like a bug
if I could catch her.\\
265 - But I do look pretty.\\
266 - Rhonda, is that you?\\
267 - Boy, you look like
a different girl.\\
268 - Do you like it?\\
269 - Well, I thought we would begin our
evening with a hot dog eating contest.\\
270 - Now, I realize
you're county champion,\\
271 - but I think I could
make it interesting.\\
272 - Sorry, Fez.\\
273 - I don't eat hot dogs
for glory or money anymore.\\
274 - It's not ladylike.\\
275 - - Says who?
- Says them.\\
276 - Them?\\
277 - What have you meddling whores
done to my Rhonda?\\
278 - - It was Jackie.
- It was Donna.\\
279 - Fez, she wouldn't
let her pee or eat.\\
280 - - Donna called her Sasquatch.
- That was you, too!\\
281 - Shut up!\\
282 - Shut up. I just want her back like
she was the first night I met her.\\
283 - On her knees, chugging beer
straight from the keg.\\
284 - But, Fez, I threw up twice
that night.\\
285 - Yes.\\
286 - All over my heart.\\
287 - You big, lovable, clumsy galoot.\\
288 - And now, it is time
that you two left.\\
289 - Good day.\\
290 - - But, Fez.
- He said, "Good day!"\\
291 - So I'm a duck, huh?\\
292 - Yeah, we'll see who's a duck.\\
293 - Oh, hey, there you are.\\
294 - Yeah, we need to talk, man.\\
295 - I've been thinking about
this whole Stacy thing...\\
296 - It's your fault. Yeah.\\
297 - You were too tough on me,
so now I'm soft.\\
298 - Oh, boo-hoo.\\
299 - You don't know the first thing
about tough.\\
300 - My old man was tough.\\
301 - When I was your age,
he shipped me off to the Navy.\\
302 - He sure as hell wasn't setting
me up with cute cashiers,\\
303 - which I'm sorry I did,
because now I've got this\\
304 - creepy little girl giving me
google eyes all day,\\
305 - sticking heart-shaped notes
in my locker.\\
306 - And on top of it all,\\
307 - I had to have a talk with
your mother about infidelity.\\
308 - That was unpleasant!\\
309 - So you just be grateful that your
dad doesn't yell at you 24 hours a day!\\
310 - And don't give me that look,
because this isn't yelling!\\
311 - When I yell, you'll know it!\\
312 - Well, thanks. Good talk.\\
313 - Man, look at all this stuff.\\
314 - I just realized how happy I am
not to be a girl.\\
315 - Well, that should have
happened at a much younger age.\\
316 - - How long was I out?
- Long enough.\\
317 - You guys wanna get a burger?\\
318 - Out in public?
Okay, I'll drive.\\
319 - I'll buy.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Third Wheel}
1 - Hey, hey.
Do you guys hear that?\\
2 - That was me.
I had hot dogs for lunch.\\
3 - Not that. I'm talking about
the sweet sound of no women.\\
4 - I never hear that. Jackie's
voice is burnt into my brain.\\
5 - I wish it would stop,
but it won't.\\
6 - Remember back in the day
when it was just us guys?\\
7 - - That was good times.
- Or like desperate,\\
8 - "I don't care if she has a
moustache, I'll take her anyway" times.\\
9 - You know what?
I say, who needs women?\\
10 - Come on. Let's get crazy.
What was that?\\
11 - Did someone say mini golf?\\
12 - I'm still not allowed
back in there.\\
13 - I mean, what's the point of
having a windmill you can't ride?\\
14 - Oh, we could go beer bowling.
That's always fun.\\
15 - I am in, because beer
makes you a better bowler.\\
16 - That's a proven fact.\\
17 - Wait. Do I have to use
the Pink Ladies ball again?\\
18 - Now, Fez, why do you ask that question
when you already know the answer?\\
19 - Pink ball only
until I lose my virginity.\\
20 - Sorry. Them's the rules.\\
21 - All right, fellows.
You know the rules.\\
22 - You get a strike, you chug.
You get a gutter ball, you chug.\\
23 - You get a 7-10 split,
seven to 10 chugs.\\
24 - Hey, guys, look,
I got 10-pound balls.\\
25 - Man, that joke never gets old.\\
26 - Hey, guys,
my balls have holes in them.\\
27 - Now, why isn't that funny?\\
28 - This is living. A little
bowling, a lot of beer,\\
29 - just us guys.\\
30 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
31 - Man, bowling-alley chicks
are easy.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - We're all all right\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
41 - Jill. Glad you could make it.\\
42 - Guys, this is Jill,
the girl I told you about.\\
43 - Oh, you're the one
that hasn't put out yet.\\
44 - - Hi, nice to meet you.
- You, too.\\
45 - - So, who's up first?
- Me.\\
46 - Can I be next?\\
47 - Hey, buddy? Hyde? Buddy? Can
I talk to you for a second, buddy?\\
48 - Hyde, what's going on?\\
49 - I thought this was supposed
to be guys' night.\\
50 - Oh, don't worry about it, man.
She's cool. She's like one of us.\\
51 - In three beers, she'll be
belching like a Kennedy.\\
52 - This is guys' night only, man.\\
53 - Yeah, I say out with the whore.\\
54 - Hey, I'll buy
the next round of beer.\\
55 - The whore stays.\\
56 - Okay, good night, you two.\\
57 - - Boy, that Joanne,
she's something, huh?
- Yeah, she's nice. I like her.\\
58 - Good. Good. Me, too.\\
59 - Not that I'm ready to jump
into anything. I hate jumping.\\
60 - Makes me jiggle.\\
61 - But I won't like her
if it bothers you.\\
62 - 'Cause I know you've had a
tough time since your mom left.\\
63 - No, Dad, I think it's nice
that you have a friend.\\
64 - - Really?
- Yeah.\\
65 - I also think it's nice that you're
bathing and shaving again.\\
66 - Yeah. That was a long
eight weeks, wasn't it?\\
67 - So long.\\
68 - Boy, Kitty,
you missed a great game.\\
69 - The Bucks made a last-second
shot and sent those Lakers home\\
70 - with their tails between their
California fruitcake asses.\\
71 - Go home, fruitcakes.\\
72 - I've never seen old Pastor Dave
so excited. He swore at the referee.\\
73 - "Son of a stitch."
I said, "Son of a stitch."\\
74 - Oh, well.
I'm sure that fooled God.\\
75 - Hey, Dave, the Celtics
are in town tomorrow.\\
76 - - You up for it?
- I'm in.\\
77 - Oh, Pastor Dave,
tomorrow's Sunday.\\
78 - - You have church on Sunday.
- Right, church. Church, right.\\
79 - Well, just get someone
to sub for you.\\
80 - Every Sunday, I see six
other guys up there in robes,\\
81 - who only shake themselves
awake when the wine comes out.\\
82 - Any one of them
could do your job.\\
83 - If God didn't want me to go
to basketball,\\
84 - he wouldn't have made
foam fingers so much fun.\\
85 - Check it out. "The hand of God
is pointing at you."\\
86 - Okay, see you at church.\\
87 - Yes! Another strike
for Forman.\\
88 - Man, is there anything better
than bowling with the boys?\\
89 - Yeah.\\
90 - - Making out with a chick.
- Exactly.\\
91 - But first. Hey, Kelso,
there are words on my balls.\\
92 - Let's go.\\
93 - Fine. Go.\\
94 - But they're gonna miss the
finest game of 10-pin since\\
95 - Marvelous Marv Winkleman,\\
96 - Wisconsin's velvet thumb.\\
97 - Yes! That's another strike!\\
98 - You guys, I'm in
some kind of beery zone.\\
99 - All right. That's it.\\
100 - Hey, Jill?
Hey, thanks for stopping by.\\
101 - Hyde, wipe your mouth.
Let's go.\\
102 - I was gonna go home with Jill.\\
103 - Well, we came together,
Hyde, so...\\
104 - I kind of think
we should leave together.\\
105 - Fine. Steven, call me later.\\
106 - Forman, what the hell
are you doing, man?\\
107 - Me?\\
108 - You spent all night making out
with little Miss Can't-Find-a-Bra.\\
109 - Hey.\\
110 - - Come on. You made me
the third wheel.
- Who cares, man?\\
111 - Her parents are out of town,
and they got a waterbed.\\
112 - But you killed that dream.
I'm out of here.\\
113 - But you don't get to storm
out, okay? I storm out.\\
114 - - Hiya, princess.
- Rhonda?\\
115 - What are you doing here?\\
116 - Waiting for Fez,
chomping some cheese curls.\\
117 - You know what? Michael doesn't
tell me where he goes, either.\\
118 - I hate that.\\
119 - Kelso and Fez are on their way
back from bowling.\\
120 - They want to make out.\\
121 - Wait. How'd you know all this?\\
122 - Let's French, ladies.\\
123 - Michael, she's in the loop.
Why am I not in the loop?\\
124 - All right. Look, Jackie.\\
125 - I don't know what loop
you're talking about, but...\\
126 - If she's already in it, I don't think
there's gonna be room for you, too.\\
127 - Donna. Well, you're up early.\\
128 - - Surprisingly early.
- You slept here?\\
129 - Already? You just met.\\
130 - Listen, Donna,
I'm gonna be honest with you.\\
131 - Your father and I have started
an intimate relationship.\\
132 - And, you know, it's still
a little awkward for us.\\
133 - Emotionally, not physically.\\
134 - - Well, a little...
- I think I might be sick.\\
135 - Look, I know this is a lot
for you to take in right now.\\
136 - But I think it would be better for
all of us to just stop the charade\\
137 - and get it all out in the open.\\
138 - Joanne. When did you get here?\\
139 - Oh, my God.\\
140 - Oh, look at the time.\\
141 - And on a personal note, I
have an announcement to make.\\
142 - I have always found happiness in
serving the good people of Point Place.\\
143 - But after talking
to a dear friend,\\
144 - I realized the church is
just not where the party is,\\
145 - if you know what I mean.\\
146 - So I'm resigning as your pastor,\\
147 - thanks to my friend Red Forman.\\
148 - Red, give the crowd a wave.\\
149 - Well, if you weren't going to hell
before, you're going first class now.\\
150 - Go, Bucks!\\
151 - Kelso, you should tell Jackie
where you go.\\
152 - That way, when she wants to
do it, she can find you and do it.\\
153 - Boy, do I want to do it.\\
154 - Fez, the foundation of every
good relationship is three words.\\
155 - "I don't know."\\
156 - "Where are you going?"
"I don't know."\\
157 - "What are you thinking about?"
"I don't know."\\
158 - "Who's that under you?"
"I don't know."\\
159 - You see, it's bulletproof.\\
160 - - Why are you friends with him?
- I don't know.\\
161 - Hyde, what the hell?
What is she doing in my seat?\\
162 - I don't know.
That's a good one, Kelso.\\
163 - Just sit on the floor.\\
164 - The floor?
Why don't I sit on the floor?\\
165 - Visitors get the floor, all right?
And that's you, Terri Tube Top.\\
166 - Oh, and by the way, it's winter.\\
167 - You're a drag.\\
168 - Okay, sayonara, Yoko.\\
169 - What?
We're kind of the Beatles.\\
170 - So it's just supposed to be
guys' night out, right?\\
171 - And in walks Hyde's skank
of the week to wreck it all.\\
172 - Years of friendship trumped
by one pair of lopsided boobs.\\
173 - Yeah, that's right. I noticed,
but I didn't say anything.\\
174 - Because I'm nice.\\
175 - I had to talk to my dad's new girlfriend
about the sex they had last night.\\
176 - Yeah, okay, you win.\\
177 - You know, at first I thought it
was great my dad had a friend.\\
178 - But when I found out
they were doing it,\\
179 - it took things to, like,
a sick place, you know?\\
180 - And it really made me realize
that my mom is gone.\\
181 - Like, gone.\\
182 - Maybe you should say something.\\
183 - No. He's been through so much.\\
184 - I mean, I want him
to be happy, you know?\\
185 - Yeah. So Bob's sleeping
with Joanne, huh?\\
186 - God, am I, like, the only guy in
Point Place who's not getting any?\\
187 - Yes. Yes, you are.\\
188 - - And you think that's funny?
- Yes. Yes, I do.\\
189 - Mrs. Candiotti just told me to shove a
very holy book in a very unholy place.\\
190 - Nice going, Red.
The whole church hates us now.\\
191 - Kitty, I had nothing to do
with Dave leaving the church.\\
192 - You know,
God works in mysterious ways.\\
193 - - "Let he who is without..."
- Oh, can it.\\
194 - Well, the torch-carrying mob will be
here any minute. Better turn on the light.\\
195 - They won't need a light.
They've got torches.\\
196 - Rhonda? How'd you get in here?\\
197 - I used my key.\\
198 - Michael, why does she have
a key and I don't?\\
199 - Well, it's not because everyone
doesn't want you to have one.\\
200 - That's for sure.\\
201 - Don't sweat it, small stuff.
We're all part of the gang.\\
202 - Excuse me?\\
203 - No. I had to kiss butt for, like,
a year to be a part of this gang.\\
204 - That was you being nice?\\
205 - Good God.
She thinks she was being nice?\\
206 - Look, all I know is you
are not a part of this gang.\\
207 - Really?\\
208 - Well, Snow White.\\
209 - Why don't we wrestle for it?
And if I win, I'm in.\\
210 - Street rules. No tap-outs.\\
211 - - Okay, okay, you're in.
- Yeah. I'm in.\\
212 - That's nice, but maybe you
should wrestle her anyways.\\
213 - Oh, yeah!\\
214 - All right. Shirts off.
Let's get it on!\\
215 - Oh, good. You're both here.\\
216 - Look, I know you two are together
and, Dad, I want you to be happy.\\
217 - But I just don't think
I'm ready for this.\\
218 - Joanne, when did you get here?\\
219 - - Dad.
- Bob.\\
220 - All right. Donna, what do you
want us to do?\\
221 - - You want us to
stop seeing each other?
- No. No. It's just that...\\
222 - Well, could you
go back to lying to me?\\
223 - I mean, that seemed to work.\\
224 - I am always in favor of lying
when it comes to children.\\
225 - Bob, we were honest with Donna
and now she's being honest with us.\\
226 - We'll hold off on the
overnight visits for a while.\\
227 - Thank you. Thanks.
That's really... Thanks.\\
228 - Well, if you're not staying the
night, we'd better get upstairs.\\
229 - Oh, hey, Hyde. Is that you?\\
230 - I didn't recognize you without
skankarilla hanging off your face.\\
231 - You still on this?
It's like having a wife.\\
232 - Listen, don't flatter yourself.\\
233 - I'd only marry someone
who's nice to his friends.\\
234 - Her friends. Shut up. The...\\
235 - - The point is...
- Yeah, man, I get the point.\\
236 - And you can drop it,
all right? She dumped me.\\
237 - - What?
- Yeah. She said
she didn't like you.\\
238 - I told her, "Too bad. We're
friends." And that was it.\\
239 - Oh, man, I feel terrible.
Is there anything I can do?\\
240 - I don't know, man.
I kind of really liked her.\\
241 - Hey, how does 10 bucks sound?\\
242 - - Forman, 10 lousy bucks
can't replace Jill.
- Yeah.\\
243 - - How about 20?
- Jill who?\\
244 - - Hey, Red.
- Dave, what's with you?\\
245 - You don't just
up and leave the church\\
246 - because I invited you to
a basketball game on Sunday.\\
247 - Red, you said it yourself.\\
248 - There are six guys who would
take my place. No one would notice.\\
249 - Sit down, Dave.\\
250 - Let me tell you a little story
about three bags of dog crap.\\
251 - One on my front porch,
one in my mailbox,\\
252 - and one in the backseat
of my car,\\
253 - all from people who are
so upset about losing you\\
254 - that they are willing to find,
handle, and bag dog crap.\\
255 - Really?\\
256 - My congregation has turned to vandalism
and petty harassment on account of me?\\
257 - I am truly blessed.\\
258 - - Then you're staying?
- Yeah.\\
259 - Good. Now, come on.\\
260 - Let's celebrate by returning
those bags to their rightful owner.\\
261 - Like it says in the Bible, "As
you sow, so shall you reap."\\
262 - Jesus was talking about love,
but it works for doggy doo, I think.\\
263 - Jill, what are you doing here?\\
264 - All right. I confess.
T'was me.\\
265 - - I asked Jill to meet us here.
- Jill, Hyde's my friend.\\
266 - That's no reason
to break up with him.\\
267 - What? He broke up with me.\\
268 - He said he had to spend time with
you because of some brain inflammation\\
269 - that made you act
like a dill-hole.\\
270 - But I don't have a brain thing.\\
271 - He forgets he has it.
It's part of the disease.\\
272 - - Why did you lie to me?
- Yeah, and me.\\
273 - The thing is you like
the Little River Band.\\
274 - I mean, I can't be with a girl
who likes the Little River Band.\\
275 - Yeah, take that, missy.\\
276 - And you. You wouldn't shut up
about me making out on guys' night,\\
277 - which wouldn't have bothered you if
you had a tongue stuck down your throat.\\
278 - So for the love of God, man,
find a tongue.\\
279 - I do need a tongue.\\
280 - Hey, Jill,
I like the Little River Band.\\
281 - - You're both freaks.
- Nice try.\\
282 - Hey, what are you guys
doing here?\\
283 - Jackie and Rhonda
are all mad at us.\\
284 - We encourage
one little topless girl fight.\\
285 - And then all the sudden,
we're the jerks.\\
286 - - So let's bowl.
- Hey, guys, look,
I got 10-pound balls.\\
287 - Hey, guys,
my balls are black and blue.\\
288 - Good one.\\
289 - - That's nice.
- That's funny.\\
290 - That was good.\\
291 - My balls are finally funny.\\
292 - No, no, no.
No tap-outs, you girls.\\
293 - Yes! We have a winner!
\subsection {Episode 12: An Eric Forman Christmas}
1 - So, Eric, have you made your
Christmas list for Santa yet?\\
2 - Well, um, I was going to,
but then I turned 10.\\
3 - Steven made his.\\
4 - T-shirts.\\
5 - Well, I guess I could ask for a
cassette player for the Vista Cruiser,\\
6 - like I have for
the last 80 years,\\
7 - but I won't get one, so, I might
as well just ask for a raincoat.\\
8 - Oh, so you want a raincoat.\\
9 - Man, remember when you used to
come downstairs Christmas morning\\
10 - and you'd see your stocking over
the fire, you know, all filled with toys?\\
11 - Well, one year, I saw my
mom's pantyhose on the radiator,\\
12 - and, uh, Uncle "Strange Man"
sleeping on the floor.\\
13 - He had a red nose though.
That's Christmas-y.\\
14 - Yeah, Christmas used to be
so cool.\\
15 - - Now it's just another day.
- Okay. Okay.\\
16 - It sounds like somebody needs
a little holiday cheer.\\
17 - I know!\\
18 - You could direct the
Christmas pageant at the church.\\
19 - Hey, yeah, that's the
worst idea I've ever heard.\\
20 - Eric, you used to love that
pageant when you were a little boy.\\
21 - And you need some Christmas
spirit. And I already signed you up.\\
22 - Well, it was fun
when we were kids.\\
23 - Then again,
so was eating crayons, but...\\
24 - Yeah, okay. I'll do it.\\
25 - - Good. Okay, now, Steven...
- No!\\
26 - No!\\
27 - Oh.\\
28 - So, you won't be in a show about
how there was no room at the inn,\\
29 - even though this innkeeper
gave you a room?\\
30 - Your guilt has no power over me!\\
31 - I'll do it.\\
32 - Fa la la la la,
la la la, boned\\
33 - Hanging out\\
34 - Down the street\\
35 - The same old thing\\
36 - We did last week\\
37 - Not a thing to do\\
38 - But talk to you\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
42 - Ho! Ho! Ho!\\
43 - Guys, check this out. It looks
just like when we were kids.\\
44 - And look, the Wise Men gifts,
gold, myrrh, and...\\
45 - Hyde, I think this one's yours.\\
46 - That'd be my
baggie of frankincense.\\
47 - Well, if it isn't
Mr. First-time Director.\\
48 - I thought I'd direct,
but the church board,\\
49 - whose average age
is "nearly dead,"\\
50 - feels that I don't speak to
the younger generation.\\
51 - Oh, Pastor Dave, I loved last
year's Silent Night, Jazzy Night.\\
52 - It was really funny.\\
53 - It was a drama.\\
54 - You guys, you guys!
Great news.\\
55 - Rudolph, Santa Claus
is Comin' to Town,\\
56 - The Little Drummer Boy,
they're all on TV this week.\\
57 - We can watch them!\\
58 - Yeah. We can wear our PJs and
eat gumdrops and drink Kool-Aid.\\
59 - Hooray!\\
60 - Yeah!\\
61 - Okay, guys,
let's talk about your parts.\\
62 - Okay, Eric,
I want to be the Virgin Mary.\\
63 - See, she's pure and holy
and rides a unicorn.\\
64 - No, Jackie, uh,
she doesn't ride a unicorn.\\
65 - She does now.\\
66 - A white unicorn with speckles.
Write that down.\\
67 - Hey, is there anyone in this show who
just kinda lies there and does nothing?\\
68 - Um, there's the baby
in the manger.\\
69 - I call baby in the manger.\\
70 - Uh, all right, Eric,\\
71 - I don't want to play Joseph
as a carpenter.\\
72 - Oh, how about if I play him
as a spaceman?\\
73 - Okay, uh, Kelso, I don't think
Jesus was the son of a spaceman.\\
74 - Oh, really?
Where do you think God lives?\\
75 - It's true, man.\\
76 - What the hell?\\
77 - It's the Russians.\\
78 - Oh, jeez.\\
79 - Bob!\\
80 - Hey there,
hi there, ho-ho-ho there!\\
81 - Bob, it's midnight!
Turn that crap off!\\
82 - What would I do that for?\\
83 - Hey, check out
the keister on Mrs. Claus.\\
84 - I know what I want
for Christmas.\\
85 - Bob, are you drunk?\\
86 - I'm not sober!\\
87 - Eric, I have a little problem
with my part.\\
88 - Um, it turns out you have me
playing a Wise Man.\\
89 - Why can't there be
any Wise Women?\\
90 - Yeah, okay.\\
91 - I'll take that up with the guy
who wrote the Bible.\\
92 - Let me get back to you.\\
93 - Okay, Kelso, you are now
playing a Wise Man.\\
94 - - Or a space Wise Man.
- Better. Better.\\
95 - How come the foreign guy
has to play the shepherd?\\
96 - I have never
herded sheep in my life.\\
97 - Well, once, as a favor.\\
98 - Why can't I be a lifeguard?\\
99 - Or a space lifeguard.\\
100 - Then I could herd
all the ladies into the pool.\\
101 - "Into the pool, ladies!"\\
102 - Now, that's a good role.\\
103 - Okay, uh, everyone? Everybody?\\
104 - Um, all of your ideas
are all, um...\\
105 - Stupid. Okay, moving on.\\
106 - At the end of the play, when
Santa comes in that door...\\
107 - - Oh! How about...
- Kelso, I swear to God,\\
108 - if you say space Santa, I'm
gonna kick you in the head.\\
109 - Never mind.\\
110 - Red, are you stealing
Bob's Christmas decorations?\\
111 - It's only stealing
if you, uh... If you keep it.\\
112 - I'm throwing all this crap away.\\
113 - Oh, my God.
I'm married to the Grinch.\\
114 - I'm Mrs. Grinch.\\
115 - Well, as long as you're not
Mrs. Tattletale, we'll be fine.\\
116 - Leo, those guys are
driving me crazy in there.\\
117 - Do you know what they think
is Christmas-y? Unicorns.\\
118 - Right, no, I'm sorry.
Space unicorns.\\
119 - Well, that's redundant.\\
120 - Do you have any idea what
this is gonna look like, man?\\
121 - Shark! Everybody out of the
water! And off with your tops!\\
122 - Make way,
Virgin Mother coming through.\\
123 - We come bearing gifts of
frankincense, myrrh, and Led Zeppelin IV.\\
124 - Let me get a look at that cute
little baby girl Jesus.\\
125 - Rockin' around
the Christmas tree\\
126 - At the Christmas
party hop...\\
127 - I'm just gonna go home.
Holiday Inn is on TV.\\
128 - Now, that's Christmas.\\
129 - You can't go home, man.\\
130 - This pageant's your chance to
spread some Christmas spirit.\\
131 - And that's contagious, like VD.\\
132 - I just...\\
133 - I don't think
I have it anymore, Leo.\\
134 - Don't be fooled, man.\\
135 - VD comes back.\\
136 - No, not...\\
137 - Okay.
Yeah, I'll watch for that.\\
138 - So, dipping into
the frankincense, I see.\\
139 - Well, no more of that, okay?\\
140 - We're gonna do this play the
way it was meant to be done.\\
141 - And no spaceman.\\
142 - And anyone who doesn't like
that is no Christmas friend of mine.\\
143 - And we should be
a little bit nicer\\
144 - to those of us who want
to watch Christmas specials.\\
145 - I mean, when Rudolph's nose
shone so bright,\\
146 - and Santa realized he could
guide the sleigh at night,\\
147 - that was a great moment
in American history.\\
148 - Kelso, Rudolph was small,
had a girlie voice,\\
149 - and I'm pretty sure he was
a little light in the hooves,\\
150 - if you know what I mean.\\
151 - Of course he was light in
the hooves. He could fly.\\
152 - Oh!\\
153 - I would have guessed Prancer.\\
154 - Well, you've all ignored me,\\
155 - so I'll take that as a
resounding vote of confidence.\\
156 - Guys, let's do this thing.\\
157 - What on God's green earth?\\
158 - But, Pastor Dave, I was just...\\
159 - Oh, I know what you were doing.\\
160 - I recognize that smell
from the AC/DC concert.\\
161 - I was handing out leaflets.\\
162 - - No, but I wasn't...
- Eric Forman, you're fired.\\
163 - You know what? Fine.\\
164 - Rudolph had a girlfriend.
Her name was Clarice.\\
165 - She thought he was cute.\\
166 - Okay, if anyone was gay,
it was that... That Hermey.\\
167 - No straight elf
has hair like that.\\
168 - Well, as you may know by now,
I had to let Eric go.\\
169 - Wait, you fired Eric?\\
170 - Who's gonna direct the play?\\
171 - I guess that responsibility
falls unto me.\\
172 - And I am willing to be the
reluctant hero on this year's pageant,\\
173 - and whip all you
ne'er-do-wells into shape.\\
174 - Okay, kids, that was a good one.\\
175 - Now, let's work on the scene
where you untie me.\\
176 - And action.\\
177 - Give me my stuff back, Red.\\
178 - Don't know what you're
talking about, Bob.\\
179 - And no!\\
180 - Oh, Red, just give it back.\\
181 - You don't want anybody
to have a happy Christmas.\\
182 - Oh, you want happy?
Drink another six-pack.\\
183 - Oh, this is nice.
This is great.\\
184 - I guess we have a new tradition
here, The Annual Yuletide Fight.\\
185 - God, can't anybody just act decent
for one freaking day of the year?\\
186 - Well, out of
the mouths of babes, huh?\\
187 - Well, fine.\\
188 - Bob, your decorations are in the
dumpster behind the liquor store.\\
189 - Thanks, Red.\\
190 - If I had mistletoe,
I'd kiss you.\\
191 - Yeah, well, if I had
mistlefoot, it'd be in your ass.\\
192 - You know what I would like
for Christmas?\\
193 - No more talk about you putting
your foot in other people's rear ends.\\
194 - Maybe next year, Kitty.\\
195 - Whoa, dudes.
What did you do, man?\\
196 - Leo, man. We're just about
to light the Dave.\\
197 - I can't believe you guys.\\
198 - You managed to bring
a man of God to tears.\\
199 - I'm not crying.\\
200 - I'm talking about me, man.\\
201 - You know, you guys can hassle
your skinny friend, Eric,\\
202 - but when it comes down to
a fundamental moral core,\\
203 - he's the only one of you
that's got one.\\
204 - So, congratulations.
You've ruined Christmas.\\
205 - Oh, man.\\
206 - Leo's right. I mean, this
probably isn't our finest hour.\\
207 - I don't know.
It's pretty damn fine.\\
208 - Well, Jackie, you know, since
everything's ruined, we could,\\
209 - I don't know,
go home and watch Rudolph.\\
210 - Michael, those shows
are for babies.\\
211 - But I want to watch it.\\
212 - I wanna!\\
213 - Grow up, Michael.\\
214 - You never let me have any fun!\\
215 - You guys, I feel
kind of bad about Eric.\\
216 - - Yeah, maybe
we should go find him.
- Yeah.\\
217 - Or we could stay here
and wrap Dave.\\
218 - I say, get Eric.\\
219 - Come on.\\
220 - Uh, guys?\\
221 - Oh, right.\\
222 - There you go.\\
223 - Oh, honey, you looked so sad.\\
224 - I am gonna let you open your
big Christmas present early.\\
225 - Wow.\\
226 - It's kind of the size of...
And it's kind of heavy like...\\
227 - I knew you wanted one.\\
228 - I can't believe that you
finally got me a raincoat!\\
229 - See, it's London Fog.
Did I fool you?\\
230 - I put rocks in the bottom,
so it would seem heavy.\\
231 - Well, that's clever.\\
232 - Okay, now.\\
233 - I'm gonna wrap it back up.\\
234 - You can open it Christmas
morning and pretend you're surprised.\\
235 - Uh-huh. So, we got that
to look forward to.\\
236 - Yeah. Okay.\\
237 - Huh!\\
238 - What's the matter, Kelso?\\
239 - Rudolph,
I can't watch you anymore.\\
240 - My friends say that I'm too old.\\
241 - Ho-ho-hold the phone.\\
242 - Too old for Christmas?
That's nonsense.\\
243 - Yeah, but everyone's
making fun of me.\\
244 - You know, Kelso, people used
to laugh and call me names.\\
245 - They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer games.\\
246 - - So, what did you do?
- I kicked them in the face.\\
247 - Blitzen bled like a faucet.\\
248 - Little Drummer Boy,
what are you doing here?\\
249 - "Come," they told me.\\
250 - No, but what am I
supposed to do?\\
251 - All my friends are gonna think that I'm
a baby if I keep watching your shows.\\
252 - Oh, screw those dumb asses.\\
253 - If they're too old for Christmas
specials, that's their loss.\\
254 - Can I go now? I'm very cold.\\
255 - Kelso, as long as you really,
really believe in our magical world,\\
256 - nothing in life
can ever hurt you.\\
257 - So I can watch.\\
258 - I can watch.\\
259 - Whoo-hoo!\\
260 - I can watch!
I can watch! I can watch!\\
261 - Whoo-hoo!\\
262 - - Look at that face.
- What a nice kid.\\
263 - So happy.\\
264 - I'm not too late. I haven't
missed them. Hey, Dave.\\
265 - Uh, Michael? A little help?\\
266 - Oh.\\
267 - That wasn't fun. One of
the lights burned my neck.\\
268 - You know, Pastor Dave, the
only reason we mess with you\\
269 - - is 'cause we like you.
- You do? You do.\\
270 - I'm cool. I'm cool.\\
271 - Oh. Well, if it isn't the dillholes of
Christmas past, present and future.\\
272 - We came to talk to you about the
pageant. Dave said he'll un-fire you.\\
273 - 'Cause I'm cool.\\
274 - And we'll do the pageant
however you want.\\
275 - Yeah, I set them straight, man.\\
276 - Look, Forman,
just come on back, all right?\\
277 - - Yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah. We can all be together.\\
278 - I mean,
it's Christmas, you know?\\
279 - Plus, we got you a present.\\
280 - Oh, man.\\
281 - A cassette deck.\\
282 - You guys, thanks.\\
283 - So, you'll come back?\\
284 - Yeah, okay.\\
285 - Oh. Merry Christmas,
Charlie Brown.\\
286 - Whoa!\\
287 - Hey.\\
288 - Those decorations
aren't half bad.\\
289 - Look, it's snowing.\\
290 - Yeah, I hooked up
the snow machine.\\
291 - Don't nobody smoke though.
This stuff might be toxic.\\
292 - Oh!\\
293 - A tape player. Didn't know
you wanted one of those.\\
294 - Isn't it beautiful?\\
295 - Hey, Steven. Fix that
light up there, will you?\\
296 - - Oh, I dropped my candy.
- Oh, no!\\
297 - Oh. Ah. My knee.\\
298 - How's that?\\
299 - Behold!
The Virgin has given birth.\\
300 - Isn't he cute?\\
301 - He's got my eyes.\\
302 - And my hair.\\
303 - Hark, we come bearing gifts.\\
304 - Gifts from space.\\
305 - Kelso.\\
306 - No! Earth air! Toxic! Choking!\\
307 - God bless us, everyone.
\subsection {Episode 13: Jackie Says Cheese}
1 - Hey, L'Eggo my Eggo.\\
2 - Hey, L'Eggo my foot in your ass.\\
3 - Oh, good morning.\\
4 - Oh, here, honey. I brought you
something back from the hospital.\\
5 - A lollipop.\\
6 - Mom, I'm 17 years old.\\
7 - Which is why I also
brought you condoms.\\
8 - Now, see, we had a teenage mom
come in, and it's just,\\
9 - well, you know,
I worry about you.\\
10 - That I'll get pregnant?
You're not a good nurse.\\
11 - Now, don't be a porky mouth.
Oh. Here.\\
12 - Sexual health pamphlets.\\
13 - I just want you to know that
intercourse is a responsibility,\\
14 - not just a right.\\
15 - Okay, well, this couldn't be
more uncomfortable.\\
16 - Oh. Oh.\\
17 - - Don't forget your condoms.
- I was wrong.\\
18 - Hanging out\\
19 - Down the street\\
20 - The same old thing\\
21 - We did last week\\
22 - Not a thing to do\\
23 - But talk to you\\
24 - We're all all right\\
25 - We're all all right\\
26 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
27 - Hey, man, Red's been
spot-checking my room again.\\
28 - I can't believe
he still doesn't trust me.\\
29 - You know,
that really hurts, man.\\
30 - I'm gonna need you
to hide my stash.\\
31 - Sure. I'll put it in my dresser
under my Hong Kong Phooey socks.\\
32 - He can protect anything because
he's faster than the human eye.\\
33 - You guys, the funniest thing
just happened to Jackie.\\
34 - Michael, the most horrible
thing just happened to me.\\
35 - My father found out we're back
together, and if we don't break up,\\
36 - he'll never give me
any money ever again.\\
37 - Wait. If you break up
with Kelso, you'll be rich?\\
38 - Talk about your win-win.\\
39 - Hold on. He didn't know
we were dating?\\
40 - Here comes the best part.\\
41 - I mean the worst part.\\
42 - My dad thinks
you're a bad influence on me,\\
43 - so I kept our love a secret.\\
44 - And now, I have to decide
between you and money.\\
45 - Gosh, it's like
Sophie's Choice for morons.\\
46 - Hey, let's take a poll.\\
47 - Who thinks Sophie
should keep Kelso?\\
48 - - The money?
- Ooh.\\
49 - You guys, this isn't a joke.\\
50 - But it's funny like a joke.\\
51 - How do I choose between something
that makes my whole life complete\\
52 - and you?\\
53 - Well, I don't know, baby,
but I love you.\\
54 - Oh, Michael, I love you, too.\\
55 - Okay, I choose love.
I choose love.\\
56 - - Aw!
- Yeah, aw! Okay.\\
57 - Now, get a job
because I need a ton of money.\\
58 - Guys, I would like you to meet\\
59 - Point Place's new foreign
exchange student, Thomas.\\
60 - - Hi.
- Hi, what's up?\\
61 - Hello, pretty lady
with eyes like the sea.\\
62 - No. Which sea?\\
63 - Okay, easy there, Casa-New-Guy.\\
64 - I'm showing Thomas the ropes.\\
65 - - Hello.
- What, are you crazy?\\
66 - That's Nicole Mayzell.
She's way out of our league.\\
67 - Oh, then we must be
in different leagues\\
68 - because I just had sex
with her last night.\\
69 - New foreign guy, uno.
Old foreign guy, nada.\\
70 - This is outrageous.
The closest I have come to sex\\
71 - was when the football team
pinned me down in the shower\\
72 - and made me kiss my own ass.\\
73 - Hey, um, if you think
that's close to sex,\\
74 - then you're gonna be delighted
with actual sex.\\
75 - Yeah, Thomas, you should stay
away from the football team for a while.\\
76 - We wouldn't want a cutie
like you to get hurt.\\
77 - Oh, the football team loves me.\\
78 - I'm the new placekicker.\\
79 - What?\\
80 - Oh, the room is spinning.
How did you do all this?\\
81 - I have delightful accent.\\
82 - So do I.\\
83 - Yes, but a nerd with an accent
is still a nerd.\\
84 - Now, good day, sir.\\
85 - I say, "good day."\\
86 - - Now, good day.
- Good day.\\
87 - Good day.\\
88 - - I said, good day.
- I said, good day.\\
89 - He stole that from me.\\
90 - - But, Fez...
- I said, from me.\\
91 - Oh, I'm out.\\
92 - Out? I am home one night
this week, and you're out?\\
93 - Hey, don't look at me.\\
94 - You had a whole bag of them,
and you wasted them on Eric.\\
95 - He's probably down there
making balloon animals.\\
96 - Well,\\
97 - I guess we'll just sleep.\\
98 - Well, couldn't we just, um,\\
99 - you know, I mean, really,
what are the chances?\\
100 - We could have
a change-of-life baby.\\
101 - Oh, crap.\\
102 - I'll be right back.\\
103 - It's late. We'll talk
about this tomorrow.\\
104 - Oh, my God, my sock drawer.\\
105 - I'm dead. He found your stash.
Do you know what this means?\\
106 - Yeah. I get your room, and
you get sent to military school.\\
107 - Eric caught me
stealing his things.\\
108 - That's not funny.\\
109 - I'm a grown man.\\
110 - I don't go rummaging around
in teenage boys' drawers,\\
111 - looking for things.\\
112 - - Condoms.
- That word is forbidden.\\
113 - Okay. Good night.\\
114 - - Condoms.
- Quit it.\\
115 - I don't know. I've just always
been good-looking.\\
116 - Look at that foreign bastard.\\
117 - Cracking up the whores.\\
118 - Checking the score.\\
119 - Old foreign guy, nada.
New foreign guy, dos.\\
120 - Hey, if I pretend to say
something funny, will you laugh?\\
121 - No.\\
122 - That Thomas is shady.\\
123 - And have you noticed he never
says what country he's from?\\
124 - What country are you from?\\
125 - What country are you from?\\
126 - America.\\
127 - Fine. Mystery solved.\\
128 - Psst!\\
129 - Mom, is Dad around?\\
130 - No, I think he's upstairs.\\
131 - Hot, hot, hot, hot!\\
132 - Love you, Mom. Thanks for
breakfast. See you tonight. Bye.\\
133 - Psst.\\
134 - Kitty, Eric around?\\
135 - - No, he just left.
- Perfect.\\
136 - Red,\\
137 - this is just silly.\\
138 - You can't avoid Eric forever.\\
139 - - I know that.
- Well, good.\\
140 - I just have to avoid him
till he goes to college.\\
141 - - What's that, like a year?
- I can do that.\\
142 - Hey.\\
143 - Michael, I'm broke.\\
144 - I had to buy
generic hair conditioner.\\
145 - And now, I have split ends.\\
146 - Well, no one is gonna
notice that, baby.\\
147 - They'll all be looking at
that monster zit.\\
148 - I have to ration my cover-up.
So find a job already.\\
149 - I'm trying, okay?
It's tough out there.\\
150 - I just had an interview at that new
store in the mall, the Cheese Palace.\\
151 - - Where curd is king?
- The very same.\\
152 - They're hiring a new cheese maiden,
you know, to hand out the samples,\\
153 - but I didn't get the job
'cause they want a girl.\\
154 - - You're pretty like a girl.
- Thank you!\\
155 - Man, but the manager wants an actual
girl, you know, with boobs and stuff.\\
156 - Hey, you know who's an
actual girl with boobs and stuff?\\
157 - Oh, Donna, you don't have
to get a job just for me.\\
158 - I was talking about you,
pimple-chin.\\
159 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.\\
160 - I am not getting a job.
A job is for poor people.\\
161 - I am a rich person
who doesn't have money.\\
162 - Big diff.\\
163 - Hey, is that a blackhead?\\
164 - No!\\
165 - Cheddar? Cheddar?\\
166 - Cheddar?\\
167 - Try the Swiss. You can't miss.\\
168 - Try the Cheddar.
It's even better.\\
169 - The floor's real shiny,
and I see your heinie.\\
170 - Ugh!\\
171 - Hey. The cheese maiden hit me!\\
172 - Cheese guards, seize her!\\
173 - My God, this job is awful!\\
174 - Are you sweating?\\
175 - I mean,
is work making you sweat?\\
176 - No.\\
177 - I'm glistening! It's glisten!\\
178 - Whatever it is, yuck!\\
179 - Look, Michael,\\
180 - the only reason I have this job is
so that you and I can be together.\\
181 - All you've done for our love is
sit in the basement eating Fritos.\\
182 - Well, for your information, if I
send in 80 empty Frito bags,\\
183 - I get a free remote-control car.\\
184 - Which I was gonna give to you
after I played with it only a little.\\
185 - Now, that is love!\\
186 - Thomas.\\
187 - Thomas.\\
188 - Thomas!\\
189 - What I have to do is show everyone
that I am cooler than Thomas.\\
190 - You know, I once saw the
Fonzie do something on TV\\
191 - that just might do the trick.\\
192 - I am now going to jump
over a shark on water skis\\
193 - to prove that I'm the coolest foreign
exchange student in Point Place.\\
194 - - He'll never make it.
- Shut up. He can do it.\\
195 - He's the Fez!\\
196 - Okay, here I go. Hit it.\\
197 - Oh!\\
198 - - He's crazy, man. He's crazy.
- He's at the ramp.\\
199 - Yes! Yes!\\
200 - - Oh, yeah, man!
- You suck, Thomas.\\
201 - Fez, you jumped that shark,
and you're not even wet.\\
202 - That's 'cause I'm cool-a-mundo.\\
203 - Ay!\\
204 - So what do you think?\\
205 - Not only is that the worst
idea I've ever heard,\\
206 - it was the worst moment
in television history.\\
207 - Yeah, you're right. I stopped
watching after that episode.\\
208 - Thomas!\\
209 - This is freaky, man. Red hasn't
said anything about the stash,\\
210 - which can only mean he's gone to
the much-feared stage beyond yelling.\\
211 - He's gone Darth Vader, man.\\
212 - Or instead of Red snagging
you, maybe you snagged Red\\
213 - dipping into Hyde's stash. I'm
just saying, everyone's trying it.\\
214 - I guess Kelso was right.
Everyone is trying it.\\
215 - I'm telling you, this stuff
isn't just for cakes.\\
216 - It's great all by itself.\\
217 - Wait, wait. Watch this.\\
218 - Look at me.
I'm Whipped-cream Head.\\
219 - Fear me.
All fear Whipped-cream Head.\\
220 - Mmm.\\
221 - Kelso, that was delightful,\\
222 - but the only part you left out
is where Red kills me!\\
223 - Forman, it was my stash. I
don't wanna leave you hanging,\\
224 - but I'm gonna.\\
225 - So good luck in military school.\\
226 - How exciting.
My first American road trip.\\
227 - I can't wait to see
Lake Dillhole.\\
228 - Well, the wait is over.
We're here.\\
229 - Now, hop out,
you crazy son of a gun.\\
230 - This is the Michigan border.\\
231 - Well, what do you know?\\
232 - So where is Lake Dillhole?\\
233 - Oh, it's right there,
behind the Get Bent Memorial.\\
234 - So, get bent, dill-hole!\\
235 - Oh, what's the score now?\\
236 - Oh, here we go. Fez, one.
Thomas, stranded in Michigan!\\
237 - - Oh, I kill me.
- Nice job.\\
238 - Thanks.
I learnt from the best.\\
239 - Thanks.\\
240 - - I would've taken his clothes.
- That's why you're the king.\\
241 - The Gouda's so good-a.\\
242 - The Havarti's a party.\\
243 - Hello, milady.
Fondue you love me?\\
244 - Stop doing that.
All day with this.\\
245 - "Hey, fondue me." "Ooh,
I stepped in fon-dog doo."\\
246 - Oh, my God, this is awful!\\
247 - Michael, a few minutes ago,
I smelled stinky cheese,\\
248 - and it was me!\\
249 - Look, I'm sorry. I love you,
but I can't do this.\\
250 - You mean, you can't fondue it.\\
251 - God, will you shut up? Look,
I am not cut out for work.\\
252 - I'm cut out for having
rich people give me things.\\
253 - But you got a job for me. I mean,
doesn't that make it satisfying?\\
254 - Oh, my gosh. It's a check!\\
255 - And that's my name!\\
256 - Mine!\\
257 - So we can stay together.\\
258 - Yeah, and I can still be rich.\\
259 - Yeah.\\
260 - Well, if this isn't gonna go
badly, I'm heading home.\\
261 - No, wait. Jackie
deserves a celebration.\\
262 - Hey, let's go buy me
that remote-control car.\\
263 - No, Michael.
Money doesn't grow on trees.\\
264 - Money doesn't grow on trees.\\
265 - You know, I think having
a job is changing me.\\
266 - Okay, think about it,
a whole new me.\\
267 - - That'd be great.
- That'd be great.\\
268 - - I gotta...
- I'm gonna...\\
269 - Okay, enough.\\
270 - You, sit.\\
271 - You can't make me join the
army, okay? I'll cut off a toe!\\
272 - - What?
- Okay, okay.\\
273 - We are just gonna clear the air,\\
274 - right now.\\
275 - Now, Eric, the other night,\\
276 - your father and I
were getting intimate...\\
277 - And we realized
we didn't have any protection.\\
278 - For hugging.
We just... We hug.\\
279 - So your dad went to your room looking
for one of those condoms I gave you,\\
280 - and you caught him, and he has
just been so embarrassed ever since.\\
281 - Condoms?\\
282 - Oh, condoms!\\
283 - Yeah, condoms.\\
284 - What did you think it was?\\
285 - What did you think it was?\\
286 - - What did you do?
- What did you do?\\
287 - What did you do?\\
288 - What?
I didn't do anything, okay?\\
289 - You stole condoms.
Get him, Mom.\\
290 - - You're grounded.
- For a week.\\
291 - Hyde, too.\\
292 - Whatever was in that drawer
that you didn't want me to see,\\
293 - I'm sure it was his.\\
294 - Fine. No complaints here.
Thank you.\\
295 - You suppose there was actually
something in that drawer\\
296 - he didn't want us to see?\\
297 - Who cares?\\
298 - I know in orientation we talked
about theft in the workplace,\\
299 - so I would like to report
a theft from my check.\\
300 - Now, I don't know who FICA is, but
that bitch stole, like, 10% of my money.\\
301 - Also, now, I don't know if you
have this key in your typewriter,\\
302 - but when I write "Jackie," I like
to dot my "I" with a smiley face.\\
303 - Also, now, I'd put this
in the suggestion box,\\
304 - but you have something hanging
from your nose.\\
305 - Oh, and I want Saturday off.\\
306 - Thank you. Bye.
\subsection {Episode 14: Eric's Hot Cousin}
1 - Hey, guys, I'm thinking
about getting a perm.\\
2 - Hyde, can I get
the number of your guy.\\
3 - I don't have a "guy," dumb ass.\\
4 - This righteous moss
is a gift from God.\\
5 - God gave me a perm, too,
but he hit me below the belt.\\
6 - What are you doing, Forman?\\
7 - My stupid cousin Penny from
Florida is coming this weekend,\\
8 - so my mom's making me
clean the basement.\\
9 - And I'm done.\\
10 - - Penny?
- God, she was
always such a tattletale.\\
11 - "Eric's stealing cookies."
"Eric's playing with fire."\\
12 - "Eric's touching himself."\\
13 - Yeah, but Eric got her back.\\
14 - He hit her with the old Bengay
on the toothbrush.\\
15 - And the
over-the-shoulder wedgie.\\
16 - And the butt-face gas attack.\\
17 - - Butt-face gas attack?
- I'll show you later.\\
18 - Thank you.\\
19 - Oh, Forman.\\
20 - My favorite was when you trapped
her in the revolving door at the library\\
21 - and kept spinning her.\\
22 - Yeah, she ralphed,\\
23 - and then she had to keep
walking through the puddle.\\
24 - 'Cause it's a revolving door.\\
25 - It spins in circles.\\
26 - That's its nature. It just...\\
27 - Hanging out\\
28 - Down the street\\
29 - The same old thing\\
30 - We did last week\\
31 - Not a thing to do\\
32 - But talk to you\\
33 - We're all all right\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
36 - - Penny!
- Aunt Kitty!\\
37 - It's so good to see you!\\
38 - Oh, my gosh,
you have grown so...\\
39 - Things have...\\
40 - Good for you!\\
41 - And good for us.\\
42 - Oh, jeez.\\
43 - Penny.\\
44 - You're so shiny.\\
45 - I am just so
excited you're here.\\
46 - I have lots of free time
these days,\\
47 - so I've gathered up
some local foliage.\\
48 - And I thought we could
have a long talk\\
49 - while we make our own potpourri!\\
50 - Well, thanks, Aunt Kitty,
but right now\\
51 - I'd just like
to catch up with Eric.\\
52 - Find out how he got so foxy.\\
53 - Okay, you boys be nice.
But not too nice.\\
54 - Look, Penny, I know
your last trip here,\\
55 - I was kind of a jerk, and...\\
56 - Oh, God, Eric!
That was so long ago.\\
57 - Plus, I can't stay mad at you.
You're too cute.\\
58 - Hey, guys, what's up?\\
59 - Oh, hey,
you remember my cousin Penny.\\
60 - Hey, Penny.
I didn't recognize you\\
61 - without Eric's butt
in your face.\\
62 - So, you guys ready for the
movies? You can come, too.\\
63 - I guess.\\
64 - Thanks, but this
Wisconsin air is so dry,\\
65 - I really should go inside and
moisturize before I lose my tan.\\
66 - I have lotion.\\
67 - I think the best plan is for
all of us to go to the movies,\\
68 - except for me and Penny, who will
stay here and moisturize each other.\\
69 - What? Screw that.
I'm gonna moisturize, too.\\
70 - - Michael!
- I'll just do,
like, a leg or something.\\
71 - Fine!\\
72 - Come on.
Let me show you to your room.\\
73 - - Michael!
- I'm getting Kool-Aid!\\
74 - Damn!\\
75 - What losers! Did you see
them checking her out?\\
76 - - Okay, she's not that hot.
- I never liked her.\\
77 - You know, once when we were
little she bit me, so I bit her back.\\
78 - And then she called, "Truce,"
so I said, "Okay."\\
79 - And then she bit me again.\\
80 - Whore.\\
81 - Slut.\\
82 - - No, her.
- Oh, yeah.\\
83 - Whore.\\
84 - Yeah, we'll show Penny
with our new sun lamp tans.\\
85 - How dare she come into
our town and try to out-hot us.\\
86 - I know.\\
87 - I mean, we don't go to her
town and try and out-whore her.\\
88 - Well, she can't just
show up all hot,\\
89 - shaking her butt around
our guys.\\
90 - If our guys are gonna fantasize
about moisturizing anybody,\\
91 - it should be us.\\
92 - Right. But we're not gonna
let them do that, are we?\\
93 - Let's just hope it
doesn't come to that.\\
94 - Have you seen that little stray cat
that's been hanging around our house?\\
95 - Oh, yeah.
I met him this morning.\\
96 - Then he met the hose.\\
97 - Kitty, we don't need more
things hanging around our house.\\
98 - We already have Steven
and Kelso and Foreign Kid.\\
99 - Yeah, but they're always busy.\\
100 - Maybe I should get my own cat.\\
101 - I'm not working.
I'm home all day.\\
102 - Here's my problem with cats.\\
103 - Best-case scenario. You get
the smartest cat in the world.\\
104 - He still craps in your house.\\
105 - Well, it's just it would be nice to
have something to take care of.\\
106 - I'll tell you what, Kitty.\\
107 - Instead of getting a cat, why
don't we all just stop flushing?\\
108 - It's the same thing!\\
109 - Guys, I'm getting some
weirdness from Cousin Penny.\\
110 - Earlier, she gave me a hug,
but this wasn't a cousin hug.\\
111 - Our middles touched.\\
112 - And not just for a second.\\
113 - She pressed.\\
114 - I've heard of kissing cousins.\\
115 - But have you ever heard
of "doing-it cousins"?\\
116 - 'Cause that's what I think
Forman should be shooting for here.\\
117 - Kelso, I appreciate the advice,\\
118 - but your solution
to every problem\\
119 - is, "Do it with her."\\
120 - Well, it worked
with my old science teacher.\\
121 - C-minus!\\
122 - Well, unfortunately,
Penny is my cousin.\\
123 - That'd be like looking at my mom
and thinking, "Hey, baby, how..."\\
124 - I'm just gonna stop right there.\\
125 - I've thought that about your
mom, but I didn't stop right there.\\
126 - Surprise!\\
127 - This ought to keep you company
during the week.\\
128 - Roy's Pet Store.
Red, you got me a cat!\\
129 - Well, it's like a cat.\\
130 - A fish?\\
131 - Red, it's a fish.\\
132 - See, it's like a cat.\\
133 - - They're both pets.
- No, they're not.\\
134 - Pets are called pets
because you pet them.\\
135 - How do I pet this thing?\\
136 - Well, you just reach in and
corner it and give it a rub.\\
137 - That's the thing about fish. They
just love the feel of the human hand.\\
138 - Jackie! Jackie, wake up.\\
139 - Oh, my God.
Donna, you're totally burned.\\
140 - Really?\\
141 - What have you done to me?\\
142 - Me? This was your stupid idea.\\
143 - Did you call me stupid?\\
144 - Ow!\\
145 - Lobster face!\\
146 - Ow. Little red riding bitch!\\
147 - Oh, my God!\\
148 - Okay! Now, okay,
let's just call a truce.\\
149 - Fine.\\
150 - Don't look at me.
Mrs. Paul killed these.\\
151 - Here.\\
152 - So...\\
153 - Must get pretty boring
living in a fishbowl, huh?\\
154 - Gets pretty boring
around here, too.\\
155 - You know, I used to work at a
hospital, and taking care of people.\\
156 - It felt so good to be needed.\\
157 - You know, like...
Like part of a team?\\
158 - People really
depended on me, which...\\
159 - Which I kind of miss.\\
160 - But at least
I don't miss the bedpans.\\
161 - Are you sure it's okay for
me to do my yoga in here?\\
162 - Do Aunt Kitty and Uncle
Red allow girls in your room?\\
163 - Well, you're my cousin, so you
don't even really count as a girl.\\
164 - You're like a rock.\\
165 - A moving, talking,
extremely limber rock.\\
166 - Ooh. That's nice.\\
167 - - Peterson's Auto Shop.
- What?\\
168 - "Peterson's Auto Shop."
That's what my T-shirt says.\\
169 - I noticed you were
trying to read it.\\
170 - That's... Yes. Yes, I was.\\
171 - I kind of have, like,
a passion for T-shirt logos.\\
172 - Okay, well, bedtime
for this logo fan, okay.\\
173 - Off you go.\\
174 - Uh-oh.\\
175 - Naughty thoughts a-brewing.\\
176 - Penny, you're cold.\\
177 - Go get a sweatshirt.\\
178 - Oh. Okay, Uncle Red.\\
179 - Eric, do I have to tell you to
stop staring at your cousin?\\
180 - Stop staring at your cousin.\\
181 - Kitty, where's breakfast?\\
182 - Honey,
I'm running a little late.\\
183 - I was redecorating
Fluffy's bowl.\\
184 - Kitty, it's a stupid fish.\\
185 - What?\\
186 - Cinnamon toast, get on it.\\
187 - Oh, so, decided
against the sweatshirt?\\
188 - It's a bold choice.\\
189 - I saw Uncle Red leaving and
I wanted to talk to you alone.\\
190 - See, I kind of
have a crush on you.\\
191 - Okay, Penny... Okay.\\
192 - Look, I don't know what
the laws are down in...\\
193 - ...Florida, but up here,\\
194 - the cousin-loving is
really frowned upon.\\
195 - That's why
I wanted to talk to you.\\
196 - Last week I overheard
my parents talking,\\
197 - and I found out
that I'm adopted.\\
198 - So technically,
we're not even related.\\
199 - Well, that's a twist.\\
200 - And all those feelings that I had
about you that would've been wrong...\\
201 - Are pretty freaking right!\\
202 - Bring it in.\\
203 - Now you're warm.\\
204 - And I don't feel bad about that.\\
205 - So Penny's not even your cousin?\\
206 - All right. Well, in light of recent
developments, I vote, "Do it."\\
207 - Do it, yellow belly!\\
208 - Look, man, if you don't do it,
I'm gonna do it.\\
209 - Then I'm gonna make fun of you.\\
210 - All right, fellas. So I
guess it's all systems go.\\
211 - Just hey, let's keep
this between us, okay?\\
212 - Hey, what's up?\\
213 - - Forman wants to
nail his cousin.
- No.\\
214 - No, no, no, she's not my
cousin. She was adopted.\\
215 - And what the hell
happened to your face?\\
216 - - What the hell
happened to yours?
- Burn!\\
217 - Yeah, I gotta admit, Donna,
that was a nice burn.\\
218 - And I don't mean what you said
just there. I mean your face. Nice burn.\\
219 - Hey, you know, if you
ever need a date for prom,\\
220 - you can just flip
through the family album.\\
221 - Oh...\\
222 - Oh, God. You're just jealous
because Penny is incredibly hot,\\
223 - and you're a throbbing red pile.\\
224 - Eric, my sunburn will fade,
but your shame will last forever.\\
225 - Yeah, well,
at least my shame won't peel.\\
226 - Hey, there's my girl.\\
227 - New logo. Nice.\\
228 - I was just having a glass
of milk before bed.\\
229 - Oh, well, you know,
you don't have to rush off.\\
230 - Sit. Come on.
Let's gab a while.\\
231 - So...\\
232 - Let's get to
the bottom of this crush, huh?\\
233 - You know what I'd
really love to do?\\
234 - Stay up late and watch movies
like we did when we were kids.\\
235 - Remember?
All alone in the dark?\\
236 - That's a good plan.\\
237 - - And let's wear our jammies!
- Excellent addition
to the plan.\\
238 - Oh, but I usually just sleep
in a T-shirt and panties.\\
239 - Is that okay?\\
240 - Well, so do I!\\
241 - Er, I mean,
you know, man-panties...\\
242 - Er...\\
243 - Underwear.\\
244 - You know what I meant.\\
245 - Great. The movie
starts at 11:00.\\
246 - - Don't be late.
- Okay, I won't.\\
247 - "Man-panties"?\\
248 - - Kitty. What happened?
- Fluffy died.\\
249 - Well, if it's any consolation,\\
250 - fish are never
even really alive.\\
251 - They're just less dead.\\
252 - I know.\\
253 - You know, he wasn't good
company, but at least he was company.\\
254 - - Red, I'm unhappy.
- Oh, I gotta go to the store.\\
255 - I am a nurturer.\\
256 - I am not gonna be satisfied nurturing
something you'd win at a carnival.\\
257 - Kitty, what do you want? I'll
get you anything you want.\\
258 - Not a cat.\\
259 - I want to go back to
the hospital to work.\\
260 - Oh.\\
261 - As long as
it's not a cat, I'm good.\\
262 - Okay, I think what you mean is,\\
263 - "I'm glad you're doing
what makes you happy."\\
264 - Oh.\\
265 - Of course.\\
266 - And I'm sorry
that your fish died.\\
267 - Don't be. I flushed it.\\
268 - Good evening, milady.\\
269 - 11:00 on the nose.\\
270 - Well, we're all alone.\\
271 - I told Hyde
to amscray for a while.\\
272 - So go ahead, take off your robe.\\
273 - Penny, there's no rat.\\
274 - - Don't, Eric! Don't!
- No, I was...\\
275 - Eric, step away
from your cousin.\\
276 - No, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.\\
277 - I'm not adopted.\\
278 - What? She's lying!\\
279 - Eric, I saw her
mother give birth to her!\\
280 - Now, what is going on?\\
281 - I'm sleepwalking.\\
282 - And I'm about to be
sleepkicking your ass.\\
283 - Eric, what kind of person
would lie\\
284 - about something as serious
as being adopted?\\
285 - A liar who specializes
in adoption lies. You.\\
286 - A mean, vindictive person.\\
287 - Like someone who would trap
someone in a revolving door?\\
288 - Yes. Oh.\\
289 - Mom, Dad, can Penny
and I be alone for a minute?\\
290 - No!\\
291 - I'm not raising any
flipper grandkids.\\
292 - No. Look, I just
wanna apologize to Penny.\\
293 - Fine.\\
294 - When you're done,
you head right upstairs.\\
295 - I'm having Pastor Dave come
over for an emergency house call.\\
296 - I guess this will teach you to
play pranks on innocent little girls.\\
297 - This has taught me a lesson.\\
298 - And that is that I'm not
gonna rest until I get you back\\
299 - way worse than you got me!\\
300 - Which by the way,
wasn't really that bad!\\
301 - Actually, it's pretty bad.\\
302 - Cousin Penny
went back home, huh?\\
303 - Oh, wait, did I say cousin?\\
304 - Yeah, I meant cousin.\\
305 - Looks like that's two hot
girls you can't have.\\
306 - Well, thank you for such
a conservative estimate.\\
307 - By the way, Donna, here's your
copy of the pictures.\\
308 - Yeah. If you flip through them
real fast, it looks like Eric's running.\\
309 - Give me those.\\
310 - Give me those.
\subsection {Episode 15: Tornado Prom}
1 - Hey, guys.\\
2 - It is literally
a million degrees out.\\
3 - I'm wearing shorts in January!\\
4 - Have you ever seen
prettier legs on a fellow?\\
5 - Michael, we'll admire
your legs later.\\
6 - Snow Prom is tomorrow.\\
7 - We need to keep up our campaign
for Snow Queen and Snow King.\\
8 - Jackie, I did campaign. I wrote
our names all over the place.\\
9 - Kelso, you peed in the snow.\\
10 - In cursive!\\
11 - It was awesome.\\
12 - Okay, look, you may not
take this seriously, but I do.\\
13 - I used to be a rich,
popular girl.\\
14 - But now that my dad has
cut me off, I'm not rich,\\
15 - so I have to be
twice as popular.\\
16 - Okay, maybe you should spend
less time worrying about being popular\\
17 - and more time being
thoughtful, friendly, considerate.\\
18 - Okay, can I get a translation?
Because that was gibberish.\\
19 - Come on, Michael.\\
20 - Hey, you know what?\\
21 - We should all go to Snow
Prom together, in one car.\\
22 - All of us hanging out,
laughing, driving.\\
23 - Good times.\\
24 - You need a ride, don't you?\\
25 - I so do. Pick me up
at the radio station.\\
26 - All right.
We'll all go together.\\
27 - Whoa, whoa. Hyde, you're
going to a school dance?\\
28 - You're gonna stink-bomb the
teachers' lounge, aren't you? I want in!\\
29 - No, man, kid stuff.\\
30 - See, during the dance, I'm going to
throw a party in Coach Ferguson's office.\\
31 - I'm bringing my best stuff.\\
32 - A party with your best stuff?\\
33 - Are you saying
what I think you're saying?\\
34 - - You know it.
- Oh, boy, you have a pinata?\\
35 - It's weird. I feel like
I'm forgetting something.\\
36 - I've got my watch, my wallet,
my who-am-I-kidding condom.\\
37 - Yeah, sounds like you got
everything, except for a tall redhead.\\
38 - Yeah. What man
doesn't love a tall red...\\
39 - Oh, my God, Donna!\\
40 - I forgot Donna.\\
41 - Hanging out\\
42 - Down the street\\
43 - The same old thing\\
44 - We did last week\\
45 - Not a thing to do\\
46 - But talk to you\\
47 - We're all all right\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
50 - Mr. Hyde?
In school after hours?\\
51 - What, are you trying
to establish an alibi?\\
52 - Coach Ferguson,\\
53 - shouldn't you be on the football
field, teaching boys to play with balls?\\
54 - Don't push my buttons, wiseacre.\\
55 - And there he goes.\\
56 - I think now is a good time
to go fumigate his office.\\
57 - Oh. I have exciting
news for you two.\\
58 - Michael, you have been
elected Snow King.\\
59 - Yeah!\\
60 - And, Jackie, you are the new
Snow Queen runner-up!\\
61 - Oh, my God! This is
the happiest day of my life!\\
62 - Wait, runner-up?\\
63 - How could that be?\\
64 - There's been a mistake.\\
65 - It was fixed.\\
66 - You poke me one more time,
I'm gonna paddle you.\\
67 - That'd be hot.\\
68 - I have
a serious announcement.\\
69 - A tornado warning has been
issued. I'm told it's code red.\\
70 - I don't know the codes,
but red sounds serious.\\
71 - Michael, this is
my worst nightmare.\\
72 - A tornado is your
worst nightmare?\\
73 - Mine's monsters.\\
74 - How could I be runner-up?\\
75 - If I'm not a rich,
popular girl, I'm nothing.\\
76 - I'm like Donna.\\
77 - No, Jackie, you are the
girlfriend to the Snow King.\\
78 - All right, now, as Snow King, I
must lead my people to safety.\\
79 - All right, everyone!
Everyone, follow me.\\
80 - Remain calm, people!
These are just sports balls!\\
81 - Everyone grab a ball!\\
82 - All right.\\
83 - I'm just so worried about Eric.\\
84 - A tornado in January?\\
85 - Yeah, life's full of surprises.\\
86 - Like these two showing up
'cause they don't have a basement.\\
87 - Surprise.\\
88 - Gee, Red, you seem grouchy.\\
89 - Surprise!\\
90 - Red, if Eric gets caught in a
tornado, he'll get blown to Canada.\\
91 - He's very light.\\
92 - Kitty, the gym is
the town's bomb shelter.\\
93 - He'll be fine.\\
94 - I just hope he's not crying.\\
95 - Everybody knows he's my kid.\\
96 - Okay, you're right.
Eric's fine.\\
97 - Let's just talk
about something else.\\
98 - Ooh, you know, Joanne taught
me a lot about lady orgasms.\\
99 - They've been around
longer than I thought.\\
100 - Okay, so talking's bad.
I know, charades.\\
101 - - No, thanks.
- What, are you chicken?\\
102 - Did you just call me "chicken"?\\
103 - That's it. Move the couch,
Kitty. She's going down.\\
104 - Oh, yeah.\\
105 - Busted, hophead.\\
106 - People of
the make-out stairwell,\\
107 - this is your Snow King speaking.\\
108 - Hit the lights, fool!\\
109 - No, there's a tornado.
Everyone go to the gym.\\
110 - The Snow King has spoken!\\
111 - All right. That's gross.
Who threw the retainer?\\
112 - Oh, my God, Fez! A tornado?\\
113 - This changes everything. This
could be our last night here on earth.\\
114 - Oh, no.
I'm going to die a virgin.\\
115 - Not if I have
anything to say about it.\\
116 - You can talk all you want,
but there's a tornado coming.\\
117 - Fez, I mean, let's do it.\\
118 - It?\\
119 - "It" it?\\
120 - All right.\\
121 - I'm going to need you.\\
122 - - Eric, you're here!
- Donna, look,
I'm sorry I'm late.\\
123 - And I really did want to pick you up before
the dance. So it's no big deal, really.\\
124 - No big deal?
It's a huge deal.\\
125 - I was in
the back filing records,\\
126 - and suddenly everyone was
gone, and I was stuck here alone.\\
127 - And you risked
the tornado for me.\\
128 - Tornado?\\
129 - What tornado...\\
130 - Could stop me from helping you?\\
131 - So, uh, tell me,\\
132 - um, is the tornado still,
like, um...\\
133 - Like, out there?\\
134 - - Yeah. They say it's a biggie.
- Oh.\\
135 - Eric, are you okay?\\
136 - Sure, it's just that now
that I know you're okay,\\
137 - I can finally start
worrying about me.\\
138 - And, see, the thing about me is,\\
139 - I don't wanna die.\\
140 - So,\\
141 - what to do?\\
142 - Let's see, there's you,
there's me, candlelight.\\
143 - You know, back in the old days
we would have...\\
144 - - We're not doing that.
- Uh-huh. Yep. Yeah.\\
145 - So quick to dismiss the thing
you once ached for.\\
146 - You mean, cheese sticks?\\
147 - If you want to
call it that, sure.\\
148 - Gyrating.\\
149 - Twisting.\\
150 - Hips!
You make me feel like hips!\\
151 - Hah!\\
152 - Time! We win.\\
153 - I was dancing!\\
154 - "You make me feel like hips"?\\
155 - It could have been a song.\\
156 - Is it hard to lose, Red?
'Cause you make it look so easy.\\
157 - You're in big trouble, bud.\\
158 - You should suspend me.\\
159 - I need a vacation.\\
160 - A tornado's coming.
It's code red.\\
161 - You know what that means.\\
162 - I think it's serious.\\
163 - A tornado?\\
164 - Deadly spirals of wind
really freak me out.\\
165 - - All right, Coach Girlie. Calm down.
- I can't die yet!\\
166 - There's so much
I haven't experienced.\\
167 - I bet I know one thing
you haven't experienced.\\
168 - Tornadoes get a bad rap, man.\\
169 - It's not like The Wizard of Oz.\\
170 - I mean, where are the midgets?\\
171 - I bet I could bench,
like, 10 midgets.\\
172 - Hey, look at all this stuff
you confiscated.\\
173 - Mine.\\
174 - Mine.\\
175 - Ooh, la, la!\\
176 - Mine now.\\
177 - Why am I not Snow Queen?\\
178 - For the last two weeks,
I was nice to everybody.\\
179 - Well, maybe not the AV club,
but I mean, come on.\\
180 - Jackie, you can't just be nice
for two weeks.\\
181 - You have to be nice
all the time.\\
182 - Or very handsome.\\
183 - Oh! My banana nose!\\
184 - I thought this was gone forever.\\
185 - It's still funny!\\
186 - Maybe Donna was right.\\
187 - Maybe being popular isn't as
important as being nice to people.\\
188 - I mean, I know that sounds
wrong, but anything's possible.\\
189 - Hey, Jackie, whatever makes
you feel better about being a loser.\\
190 - Hey, watch the banana nose!\\
191 - Hey, Hyde, when this is all over,
you think we'll still be friends?\\
192 - Well, my head says no,\\
193 - but my heart says no.\\
194 - So, no.\\
195 - Wonder what Donna and Forman
are doing right now.\\
196 - This is the best tornado ever!\\
197 - I know! And who better
to be stuck here with\\
198 - than America's most
beloved rock band,\\
199 - ladies and gentlemen, Aerosmith!\\
200 - As rock legends, we've had
some pretty good times,\\
201 - but it doesn't get any better
than this. Hello, Wisconsin!\\
202 - Yeah, I dig this joint, too.
Hello, Wisconsin.\\
203 - That was your Aerosmith?\\
204 - You're bad at that.\\
205 - Steven Tyler is way cooler,
and Joe Perry is so dreamy.\\
206 - God, you're bad at that.\\
207 - What? That was dead-on!
Right, guys?\\
208 - I bought it.\\
209 - You, uh, really
think I'm dreamy?\\
210 - Whoa.\\
211 - The station manager's stuff
is way better than ours.\\
212 - Well, I lived my dream.
Let's go.\\
213 - Oh, wait. We can't just
leave Jackie here like that.\\
214 - You're right.\\
215 - Okay, we're good.\\
216 - Oh, Toto.\\
217 - Losing Snow Queen has left me
searching for guidance.\\
218 - Surely the Wizard of Oz
can help.\\
219 - Jackie, why'd you make me
the Scarecrow? He needs a brain.\\
220 - No. No, I made you
the Scarecrow\\
221 - because you love chasing birds.\\
222 - - I do love chasing birds.
- Okay.\\
223 - Is this some kind of
joke? 'Cause I'm not laughing.\\
224 - Kelso's the Scarecrow? Yeah.\\
225 - Look, guys!\\
226 - I'm a bear.\\
227 - Fez, you're the Cowardly Lion.\\
228 - But I wanna be a bear.\\
229 - At least you got a brain.\\
230 - This sucks.\\
231 - Will everyone
just shut up?\\
232 - When it's your dream, you
could be whatever you want.\\
233 - I wanna be a bear.\\
234 - Jackie, what the hell?\\
235 - She totally made you a witch.
That's so awesome!\\
236 - She made you a flying monkey.\\
237 - What?\\
238 - Oh, crap!\\
239 - - Let's kick her ass!
- Yeah.\\
240 - Miss Wizard, I'm confused.\\
241 - I lost Snow Queen.\\
242 - And now I'm wondering
if titles and popularity\\
243 - aren't as important as being
a good person.\\
244 - Well, how do you know
when you're a good person?\\
245 - When everyone likes you,
right? When you're popular.\\
246 - And how do you know
when you're popular?\\
247 - Oh, my God!\\
248 - When you win
titles like Snow Queen!\\
249 - Winning titles and being a
good person are the same thing.\\
250 - So you go after
that title, child.\\
251 - Oh, I will, Miss Wizard.
I will.\\
252 - And remember, if someone calls
you shallow, they're just jealous.\\
253 - They're just jealous...\\
254 - Our own private stairwell.\\
255 - This is exactly how I pictured
losing my virginity.\\
256 - Except it was on
a bed of flowers\\
257 - and there were two of you.\\
258 - Tornado passed through,
is heading to Illinois.\\
259 - Kiss my ass, Chicago!\\
260 - Oh, my God! We're safe.\\
261 - Sex just doesn't seem
important anymore.\\
262 - I... I disagree.\\
263 - And... And here's why.\\
264 - Let's go
celebrate with everyone.\\
265 - Oh, you can make a tornado,
but you can't let me do it?\\
266 - Oh, you are not a just God!\\
267 - Okay.\\
268 - No six.\\
269 - No six.\\
270 - And\\
271 - six!\\
272 - Park Place.\\
273 - Pay up.\\
274 - I told you we shouldn't spend
all our money on Marvin Gardens.\\
275 - Oh, and Baltic Avenue
was such a help.\\
276 - I bought that with my
beauty-contest winnings.\\
277 - Poor Red, losing again.\\
278 - While we have this
large housing development\\
279 - that I like to call Joanne Land.\\
280 - Where's Red Land?\\
281 - I'll tell you where it is.\\
282 - - It's right up your...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
283 - This just in.\\
284 - The National Weather Service
has canceled the tornado warning.\\
285 - And updating our top story, a
local teen is in critical condition...\\
286 - Oh, game over. Call it a tie.\\
287 - - A tie? We had all the money.
- So?\\
288 - We had
the get-out-of-jail-free card.\\
289 - And you can't put
a price on freedom.\\
290 - Night, night.\\
291 - Look, Jackie,
I know you're upset,\\
292 - and I don't know why
you're not Snow Queen.\\
293 - But I do know this,
I am Snow King.\\
294 - So that's pretty cool.\\
295 - Michael, I'm not upset.\\
296 - I just had the best dream,\\
297 - and now I've got to
campaign for next year.\\
298 - Guys, how's my hair?\\
299 - - Yeah, it's fantastic.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.\\
300 - This was fun.\\
301 - We haven't just
hung out in, like, forever.\\
302 - Plus, you're, like, my hero.\\
303 - Most guys would not risk a
tornado for an ex-girlfriend.\\
304 - Yeah.\\
305 - Wow.\\
306 - Yeah, well,
I just wanted to kiss you\\
307 - before you found out
that I went to the dance,\\
308 - forgot you, and I didn't know
about the tornado.\\
309 - Okay, this was swell.\\
310 - Wait, wait, wait.\\
311 - So, you forgot me?\\
312 - Okay, you're mad.\\
313 - Actually, no.\\
314 - I mean, if we were still
dating, I'd be super pissed.\\
315 - But we're not,
so it's kind of funny.\\
316 - You know what?
Let me buy you a burger.\\
317 - I can't believe you totally snaked
a kiss under false pretenses.\\
318 - Yeah, I'm a little
proud of that, yeah.\\
319 - Well, I'm a lock for next year.\\
320 - I introduced myself to everyone,\\
321 - and I know they liked me,\\
322 - 'cause they laughed
at everything I said.\\
323 - I mean, I even shook hands with
that nose-picking, chess-club guy.\\
324 - Ooh, I'd better wash up.\\
325 - - You ready?
- Yeah.

50 - Hanging out\\
51 - Down the street\\
52 - The same old thing\\
53 - We did last week\\

55 - But talk to you\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - We're all all right\\
58 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
59 - Oh, hey, Donna.\\
60 - Hey, um,
did you see the school paper?\\
61 - Oh, yeah. Field hockey team's
going to State. Whoo-hoo!\\
62 - Uh-oh. Looks like someone
doesn't wanna talk about the new\\
63 - Most Eligible Viking.\\
64 - Look, Donna, this whole, uh,\\
65 - "most eligible" thing has
really taught me something.\\
66 - Um, I'm pretty.\\
67 - So, what do you say,\\
68 - like, we officially
start dating other people?\\
69 - Oh, I've been waiting
for your permission.\\
70 - And can I stay out past 9:00,
please, please?\\
71 - Okay. As long as you can be
cool when you see me\\
72 - with one, two or seven of
Point Place's juiciest tomatoes.\\
73 - It's just like old times.\\
74 - Eric and Donna talking about
meaningless crap that affects only them.\\
75 - I've missed it so.\\
76 - I have missed it.\\
77 - I don't have a lot going on.\\
78 - Hey, look here.\\
79 - That '58 Corvette down at
the used-car lot is still for sale.\\
80 - Oh, and look here. That diamond bracelet
down at the mall is still for sale.\\
81 - Hey, Red, get this.\\
82 - A while back, I'm in my car
crying 'cause Midgie was gone,\\
83 - and I kept having to reach
into the glove box for tissues.\\
84 - Oh, that's dangerous.\\
85 - One time I had to blow my nose,\\
86 - nearly hit that cockeyed girl
down the street.\\
87 - I could've sworn
she was looking right at me.\\
88 - So I attached a box of tissues
to the sun visor,\\
89 - sold the idea for a bundle,
and voila.\\
90 - The Weeper Keeper was born.\\
91 - Oh, God. Are you rich again?\\
92 - Yep.\\
93 - I'm back to my
I-can-buy-anything-I-want former self.\\
94 - Just picked up two sombreros
and a case of Lik-M-Aid.\\
95 - Where are you gonna wear
a sombrero, Bob?\\
96 - Where won't I wear it?\\
97 - Okay, you guys,\\
98 - which one of these
lucky ladies gets to go out\\
99 - with Point Place High's
Most Eligible Viking?\\
100 - Start with the gymnastics team,\\
101 - but go with the second string.\\
102 - Just as limber,
but with something to prove.\\
103 - How about her?\\
104 - Yeah, I made out with her once.\\
105 - Okay, I don't want my tongue
where Kelso's tongue has been.\\
106 - Oh, you better stay away
from your mom, then.\\
107 - I was kidding!\\
108 - What about her?\\
109 - Hey, I know her, man.\\
110 - She's not all there,
if you know what I mean.\\
111 - She's a space case, huh?\\
112 - No, she's missing a toe.\\
113 - Oh, you guys.\\
114 - There's that girl Emily.
Problem solved.\\
115 - Excuse me, fellas.\\
116 - Hey, Emily.\\
117 - Oh, hi, Eric.\\
118 - I saw your name in the paper.\\
119 - God, that totally
slipped my mind,\\
120 - although I think I have
a copy right here.\\
121 - Look at him.\\
122 - Donna, you have to start dating
or you're gonna look pathetic.\\
123 - And I'm gonna look pathetic
for being seen with you.\\
124 - I know. I'll set you up.\\
125 - Okay, if you don't wanna
do this, just say so.\\
126 - I don't wanna do it.\\
127 - Oh, you don't know
what you want.\\
128 - Oh, my God.\\
129 - Oh, my God.\\
130 - Rhonda just said
she has something special\\
131 - to share with me tomorrow night.\\
132 - It can only mean
that we're going to do it!\\
133 - No, no, no, listen to me.
I need a place to do it.\\
134 - Roomy and cheap.\\
135 - Just like my Rhonda.\\
136 - You can use the Fotohut, man.\\
137 - I'm always happy to lend it out
for deflowering and bar mitzvahs.\\
138 - Thank you, Leo.\\
139 - Tomorrow night,
Fez becomes a man.\\
140 - Oh, so it is a bar mitzvah.\\
141 - Well, Bob, thanks for
insisting on coming along.\\
142 - So, Red, what's so special
about this thing?\\
143 - It's barely got a trunk.\\
144 - Where do you put the groceries?\\
145 - This car isn't about groceries.\\
146 - It's about freedom.\\
147 - Speaking of freedom,
they got free doughnuts.\\
148 - Ah...\\
149 - So long, dumb-ass!\\
150 - - Hey, Red.
- Hey. Oh, yeah.\\
151 - Yeah, there's plenty
of legroom in here.\\
152 - Glad you like it.
I just bought it.\\
153 - You what?\\
154 - Yeah,
I'm picking it up tomorrow.\\
155 - Sure hope that trunk
will hold my sombreros.\\
156 - Oh, is it my turn?\\
157 - Oh, funny, 'cause tonight
is also my turn, uh, to do it.\\
158 - Guess what, Eric.
Donna has a date tonight, too.\\
159 - Yep, yep, yep.\\
160 - I set her up with Michael's
older brother, Casey.\\
161 - Oh, man, Donna's going out
with Casey Kelso?\\
162 - Casey "What's the big deal?
It's just a misdemeanor" Kelso?\\
163 - Man, that's gonna be
the best bad date ever.\\
164 - Hey,
we should hide in the trunk.\\
165 - Oh, like Spritle and Chim Chim!\\
166 - Oh, my God.
I would pay to see that date.\\
167 - "So, Casey,\\
168 - "what are your
thoughts on feminism?"\\
169 - "Well, Donna,
I think it can munch my butt."\\
170 - All right. Hey. My brother's
not that bad, okay?\\
171 - He taught us a lot of good,
useful stuff about chicks,\\
172 - like, the bigger the boobs,
the smaller the brain.\\
173 - And that's a timeless truth.\\
174 - I'll tell you
another timeless truth.\\
175 - I'm going to do it!\\
176 - I don't know why I let you
set me up with Casey Kelso.\\
177 - From what I remember,
he's, like, a Kelso.\\
178 - Ooh! He's here. Okay, come on.
Try to look pretty.\\
179 - That's it?
That's all I get is a honk?\\
180 - What kind of a jerk
won't even come to the door?\\
181 - Oh, my God.\\
182 - - Casey?
- Hey, Pinciotti.\\
183 - Man, you really
grew into those legs.\\
184 - Yeah, and you,
your arms seem bigger.\\
185 - You...\\
186 - - So you ready to roll?
- Roll? I'm ready.\\
187 - We're gonna roll.\\
188 - Fez, honey, what are you...\\
189 - Did you come for cake?\\
190 - No, I... Do you have cake?\\
191 - No, no, no. I came here
because I have this... friend.\\
192 - Oh, really?\\
193 - What's his name?\\
194 - Name?\\
195 - Johnny\\
196 - Table.\\
197 - And what's
Johnny Table's problem?\\
198 - Well, he and his girlfriend are
about to do something very special\\
199 - for the first time.\\
200 - You mean,
they're going to engage in...\\
201 - Putt-Putt.\\
202 - They are going...
They're going to Putt-Putt.\\
203 - And she has
putted around quite a bit.\\
204 - But he is a virgin putter.\\
205 - A virgin putter.\\
206 - He has never putted.\\
207 - I see.\\
208 - And my friend, uh...\\
209 - Ay...\\
210 - - Johnny Table?
- Yes.\\
211 - Um, he cannot talk to
Eric or Kelso or Hyde\\
212 - because they make fun of me.\\
213 - Him, Johnny...\\
214 - Table.\\
215 - So he's coming to you.\\
216 - Well, honey, you tell
Johnny Table to be respectful\\
217 - and wear a condom.\\
218 - Thank you, Mrs. Forman.
That's good advice.\\
219 - So, uh, may I have my
piece of cake now?\\
220 - And one for Johnny Table.\\
221 - So, when my dad saw that I had broken
the TV with the bowling ball, I said,\\
222 - "You fix it, dumb-ass!"\\
223 - Ah, it shut him up.\\
224 - You know, Eric, I've had
a crush on you for so long.\\
225 - Well, since the paper came out.\\
226 - Oh, right,
the Most Eligible Viking.\\
227 - Well,
that's just good reporting.\\
228 - I can't believe
you're Kelso's brother.\\
229 - I mean, you're nothing like him.\\
230 - 'Cause he's, like...\\
231 - And you're all...\\
232 - - Hey, you want a cold one?
- Okay.\\
233 - Thanks.\\
234 - This is fun.\\
235 - I've been spending, like, way too much
time worrying about my mom and stuff.\\
236 - Hey, I learnt something
in the Army.\\
237 - When things are tough,\\
238 - turn up the music
and crack open another beer.\\
239 - Yeah, you mean, like, things
will eventually get better?\\
240 - I don't know about that. But if
they don't, at least you'll have a beer.\\
241 - Red, guess what.\\
242 - I went down to pay
for my Corvette,\\
243 - and some jerk-wad
bought it out from under me.\\
244 - Oh. Well,
that's a tough break, Bob.\\
245 - But you know what would
make you feel better?\\
246 - A look at my new Corvette.\\
247 - Oh, my goodness, it's beautiful.\\
248 - You bought my car?\\
249 - That doesn't make me
feel better, Red.\\
250 - I'm sorry. Did I say
make you feel better?\\
251 - I meant make me feel better.\\
252 - Leo, thanks for letting me use The
Fotohut for my date with Rhonda.\\
253 - And when I say date,
I mean do it!\\
254 - Hi, Fez.\\
255 - Rhonda, you look beautiful.\\
256 - Well, I'll leave you two with the
same advice my father gave me,\\
257 - "Get a job, dopehead."\\
258 - So, here we are.\\
259 - You know, Fez,
I've been with a lot of guys.\\
260 - You're more special
than any of them.\\
261 - Now, I've cleared
a space right over here.\\
262 - And because I care
about you and about us,\\
263 - I wanna wait.\\
264 - Wait?\\
265 - Rhonda, hear me now,
things are turning blue.\\
266 - But... But, Fez, I love you.\\
267 - But... But...\\
268 - Oh, I love you, too.\\
269 - - Really?
- Yes, damn it.\\
270 - So if you want to wait,
we'll wait.\\
271 - Ah, come here, cocoa puff.\\
272 - Yeah, this is nice.\\
273 - Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go sit in the snow.\\
274 - So, anyway, I just
turn to my dad and I say,\\
275 - "Yes, I am
some sort of wise-ass."\\
276 - Well, shut him up.\\
277 - Anyway, this was fun.\\
278 - Call me?\\
279 - Okay.\\
280 - Hey, Emily!\\
281 - - On the phone, silly.
- All right.\\
282 - I am silly.\\
283 - Hey, Foreplay, is that you?\\
284 - "Foreplay."
I forgot about that.\\
285 - - Come here, little guy.
- Okay, all right.\\
286 - Okay, all right.
Good to see you.\\
287 - Okay. Okay, all right.
Okay. Okay.\\
288 - Man, you haven't changed a bit.\\
289 - Still got that haircut, huh?\\
290 - No.\\
291 - So, uh, they let you
out of the Army, huh?\\
292 - Yeah.\\
293 - It was kind of like they were
always trying to tell me what to do.\\
294 - Hey, uh, Pinciotti tells me\\
295 - you and her used to go out,
but you dumped her.\\
296 - Well, yeah. But it was kind
of complicated with the ring\\
297 - - and we talked, but she...
- Yeah, it's a great story.\\
298 - - Anyhow, I'll see
you around, Pinciotti.
- Okay.\\
299 - You, too, Foreplay.\\
300 - Yeah, okay.\\
301 - Ooh, Casey Kelso, huh?\\
302 - Better luck next time.\\
303 - No, actually, I think
I might go out with him again.\\
304 - Okay.\\
305 - What?\\
306 - Okay.\\
307 - But, um, I have
just two words for you,\\
308 - Donna Kelso.\\
309 - See you.\\
310 - What, no!
But think of the children!\\
311 - Little redheaded morons!\\
312 - They'd have to go to special
schools! It'd be expensive!\\
313 - Donna and Casey.\\
314 - He's a Kelso!\\
315 - Behold, my friends.\\
316 - Your lovable foreign exchange
student, Fez, has done it.\\
317 - With a woman.\\
318 - Fine, I'm still a virgin!\\
319 - You forced it out of me!\\
320 - Stop looking at me!
\subsection {Episode 17: Kelso's Career}
1 - Guys, look what I got
for Big Rhonda.\\
2 - Oh, it's so nice to have a
girlfriend on Valentine's Day.\\
3 - Yeah, it definitely increases the
chance of getting your fun-stuff touched.\\
4 - Well, sorry, fun-stuff.\\
5 - Looks like it's just
you and me this year.\\
6 - Unless...\\
7 - - Sorry, fun-stuff.
- Yeah.\\
8 - Oh, Rhonda's
going to love these.\\
9 - I just have to not eat them
until Valentine's Day.\\
10 - But you love candy.\\
11 - Some would say
it's an unnatural love.\\
12 - Yes, I do love candy.
But I love Rhonda more.\\
13 - Really? 'Cause there's
three pieces missing.\\
14 - Fine. I love her the same.\\
15 - Hi, sweetie. How was work?\\
16 - I am so exhausted.\\
17 - Yeah, the commute from Austria
must be a real bitch.\\
18 - A bus full of old people
stopped by the Cheese Palace.\\
19 - And when they saw free
samples, all hell broke loose.\\
20 - But the good news is,
I got paid!\\
21 - Oh, that's great.\\
22 - Because Valentine's Day's coming
up, and I need you to give me money\\
23 - and tell me whatever foo-foo
crap gift you want to get.\\
24 - Michael,
I'm not doing that again.\\
25 - Last year I gave you money and
you bought a bag of plastic dinosaurs.\\
26 - For you!\\
27 - Look,\\
28 - you need to make some cash
and buy me something nice,\\
29 - because I worked
way too hard for my money,\\
30 - and you're not getting any.\\
31 - Oh, I smell like hickory!\\
32 - Oh, this bites.\\
33 - Hey, Fez, how's it going
with not eating the candy?\\
34 - Fine, thank you.\\
35 - Hanging out\\
36 - Down the street\\
37 - The same old thing\\
38 - We did last week\\
39 - Not a thing to do\\
40 - But talk to you\\
41 - We're all all right\\
42 - We're all all right\\
43 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
44 - Oh, my God.
Casey Kelso's here.\\
45 - What?\\
46 - Oh, my God. He is so fine.\\
47 - You know,\\
48 - if you marry Casey and I marry
Michael, we'll be like sisters.\\
49 - Yay!\\
50 - Okay, go talk to him.\\
51 - I don't know.\\
52 - I want to go baby shopping
with you. Now go!\\
53 - All right. Shut up.\\
54 - Oh, my God. Casey.\\
55 - Hey, Pinciotti. How you been?\\
56 - Love the jeans.\\
57 - Really? They're blue.\\
58 - Um...\\
59 - So what have you, like,
you know, been up to?\\
60 - I been working part-time
for the railroad.\\
61 - They leave a lot
of stuff unlocked.\\
62 - You need any Cheerios or rebar?\\
63 - No, I'm good. Thanks.\\
64 - Right on. Well, listen,\\
65 - I'll give you a call sometime,
but right now I gotta go see a guy.\\
66 - He's got a leather
steering wheel cover.\\
67 - Oh, yeah. For the Trans Am.\\
68 - Yeah. I was thinking about
using my GI Bill for college,\\
69 - but, uh, Trans Ams
just kick so much ass.\\
70 - I love the Trans Am.\\
71 - Everybody does.\\
72 - - See ya.
- Okay, bye.\\
73 - He's gonna call me.\\
74 - You gave him your number?\\
75 - Of course I... didn't.
Damn it!\\
76 - Oh, that's okay. Kelsos
never call. They're like dogs.\\
77 - They're cute,
but they can't work a phone.\\
78 - Hey, Jackie.\\
79 - I thought about what you said.\\
80 - About making money, so I can
get you a Valentine's Day gift, right?\\
81 - And then I realized
that it'd mean a lot more\\
82 - if I gave you something that I
crafted with my own two loving hands.\\
83 - Oh, my God. It's horrible!\\
84 - No, it's an address rock.
You put it on your lawn.\\
85 - Happy Valentine's Day, my love.\\
86 - Michael, a rock is
not a romantic gift.\\
87 - And that's not even my address.\\
88 - That's my address.\\
89 - No, it isn't.\\
90 - That's my dad's address rock!\\
91 - No, it isn't!\\
92 - Hey, Dad. You want this?\\
93 - Thanks, son. I love you.\\
94 - I'm sorry. What?\\
95 - I love you. I really do.\\
96 - Yeah.\\
97 - Yeah.\\
98 - Donna.\\
99 - What are you doing at my house?\\
100 - Nothing. I just thought I'd come
by and see what you were up to.\\
101 - Oh, you're here to
see Casey, aren't you?\\
102 - Casey, your lover's here!\\
103 - You love my
brother. You're gonna do it with...\\
104 - Ow! Mom!\\
105 - - Thank you.
- No problem.\\
106 - Spaz face!\\
107 - - Hey, there.
- Hey.\\
108 - Um, you were gonna call me,\\
109 - and I remembered I never,
like, gave you my number.\\
110 - So, anyway, here's my number.\\
111 - Well, you know, I was gonna
get that from you tomorrow night\\
112 - when we go out.\\
113 - - We're going out?
- Yeah.\\
114 - I'll pick you up at
The Hub after school.\\
115 - I'll be in the Trans Am.\\
116 - I love the Trans Am.\\
117 - Everybody does.\\
118 - Later, Pinciotti.\\
119 - Pinciotti.\\
120 - Mom, was Dad abducted by aliens\\
121 - and replaced by an identical
creature programmed to love?\\
122 - Honey, this is breakfast.
Don't ask me things.\\
123 - He told me he loved me.\\
124 - Your father?\\
125 - No!\\
126 - Yeah.\\
127 - I think I know what happened.\\
128 - I gave your father
an early Valentine's Day card\\
129 - that said what a wonderful
husband and father he is,\\
130 - and it rhymed,
and maybe it touched him.\\
131 - It didn't look like
it touched him.\\
132 - He just...
He got up and got a beer.\\
133 - But maybe deep down...\\
134 - Deep, deep, deep down,\\
135 - something woke up.\\
136 - I am so glad he loves you.\\
137 - Yeah, but, Mom, this is weird.
He's never said that. Ever.\\
138 - I mean, one time I saved him
from getting hit by a lumber truck,\\
139 - and I think he was about
to say it, but then he said,\\
140 - "Get in the car."\\
141 - But how am I supposed
to handle this?\\
142 - You think I should say it back?\\
143 - Mmm.\\
144 - He's gonna hit me.\\
145 - Maybe not.\\
146 - I can't believe that Jackie
wants me to get a job.\\
147 - I mean, my plan has always been to
coast through life on my good looks.\\
148 - I mean, look at me! It's like
I was chiseled out of marble.\\
149 - Okay, you guys, here it goes.\\
150 - Dad,\\
151 - I love you.\\
152 - I love you, Pop.\\
153 - Poppy? Pappy? Daddy? No.\\
154 - Oh, I have to... I have to stop
eating Rhonda's chocolates.\\
155 - Oh, it's hopeless.\\
156 - Kelso, if you need to make some
quick cash, just sell your blood.\\
157 - And you!
You've had enough of this!\\
158 - No, I can stop anytime I want.\\
159 - I am not selling blood.\\
160 - I mean, there's no way that anything
inside of my body's coming out for cash.\\
161 - Well, that's too bad, Kelso,\\
162 - 'cause I hear there's
this clinic in Madison\\
163 - that'll pay you for your,
um, manly donations.\\
164 - Manly donations?\\
165 - No way!\\
166 - They'll pay you for that?\\
167 - Well, I'll do that.
I'm good at that.\\
168 - "Do you have any
serious medical conditions?"\\
169 - Puked after\\
170 - Crunch Berry eating contest.\\
171 - You know what?
I'll just finish that for you.\\
172 - - Thank you.
- Now, Mr. Chang,\\
173 - you'll be in Room 2.\\
174 - Some of our clients
prefer a magazine.\\
175 - Would you like one?\\
176 - Nah. Farrah was on
Carson last night.\\
177 - I should be good to go.\\
178 - Okay, so I was in the kitchen
and Red came in,\\
179 - and I was gonna
tell him I loved him.\\
180 - But then he said
if my hair got any longer,\\
181 - he was gonna buy me
a pair of boobs. So...\\
182 - Yeah, you're in a tough spot.\\
183 - But just know I'm here
for you, 'cause... I love you.\\
184 - You know what would make Forman
feel better? A piece of that candy.\\
185 - No, no, no.
There's only nine left.\\
186 - I will guard them with my life.\\
187 - Hyde!\\
188 - Eric!\\
189 - Fez.\\
190 - Easiest money I ever made.\\
191 - They paid me 50 bucks
for my underpants navy.\\
192 - You mean your
corduroy commandos?\\
193 - Yeah, your team from the inseam?\\
194 - Your Battle-pants Galactica?\\
195 - Battle-pants Galactica.
Nice one. Wow.\\
196 - It just came to me.
Thank you.\\
197 - Man, this job is the greatest.\\
198 - It combines all my interests,
hobbies and skills\\
199 - into one money-making endeavor.\\
200 - I'm gonna get Jackie
a sweet gift.\\
201 - - Popcorn?
- Dude!\\
202 - Oh, forget it.\\
203 - All right, Kelso. Where the
hell is your moron brother?\\
204 - He was supposed to meet me at
The Hub, and he totally blew me off.\\
205 - Whoa. A Kelso blew you off?\\
206 - Oh, my God. What a shock.\\
207 - Oh, hey, uh, Colonel Mustard
called. He said, "Get a clue".\\
208 - What is wrong with you Kelsos?\\
209 - Did all of you get dropped
on your heads?\\
210 - You know, if you're mad at
Casey, why don't you go yell at him?\\
211 - I'm too tired from
working all day to argue.\\
212 - Oh, to be a working stiff.\\
213 - So,\\
214 - Red, you big, old softy,\\
215 - did anything special
happen yesterday?\\
216 - Special? Well, let's see.\\
217 - The dentist called with
a cancellation, so I went in,\\
218 - and the sadistic son of
a bitch found a cavity.\\
219 - The next thing I know,
I'm hopped up on drugs,\\
220 - and he's taking
a jackhammer to my jaw.\\
221 - I spent the rest
of the day in a fog.\\
222 - Oh, no.\\
223 - Oh, my God. You don't remember
what you said to Eric?\\
224 - Kitty, I don't even remember
how I got home.\\
225 - All right, Dad.\\
226 - Look, I tried to figure out
the right words,\\
227 - and then I realized
I just gotta say it. So...\\
228 - - Wait, Eric...
- Mom, please.\\
229 - Dad, I...\\
230 - Stop!\\
231 - He was drugged!\\
232 - ...love you.\\
233 - Go to your room.\\
234 - Rhonda is going to be
so disappointed.\\
235 - All that remains
is one lonely candy.\\
236 - Look!\\
237 - More candies!\\
238 - It's a Valentine's Day miracle.\\
239 - Oh, candy,\\
240 - you've got me under your spell!\\
241 - Jackie, I couldn't wait
till Valentine's Day.\\
242 - So, here.\\
243 - Oh, my God. Michael,
these earrings are gorgeous.\\
244 - Big day at the office?\\
245 - Yeah, I worked a double shift.\\
246 - Wait, wait. You got a job?\\
247 - Michael, I am so proud of you.\\
248 - Well, now, if it wasn't
for you pushing me,\\
249 - I would've never realized
how good it feels\\
250 - to roll up my sleeves, get a
little sweaty and earn some cash.\\
251 - Oh, this is so exciting.\\
252 - I can't wait to come
visit you at work.\\
253 - That'll speed things up.\\
254 - What's he talking about?\\
255 - Oh.\\
256 - I've been selling
my love nectar.\\
257 - What?\\
258 - Michael, you can't do that.
You're hot.\\
259 - Women are gonna want to
take your little Kelsos home.\\
260 - Oh, my God, she's right.\\
261 - Think about it.
A world full of Kelsos.\\
262 - Libraries will fall
into disrepair.\\
263 - There'll be feathered hair
as far as the eye can see.\\
264 - We'll have to put padding
on every sharp corner!\\
265 - Those sharp corners
can be hazardous, man.\\
266 - I mean, come on, it's 1978!
Things should be round by now!\\
267 - Hey! Hey, Casey!\\
268 - Hey, Pinciotti.\\
269 - What the hell happened to you?
I was waiting at The Hub!\\
270 - Oh, man.\\
271 - See, the thing is, when I went to
go pick up the steering wheel cover,\\
272 - the Trans Am was running kind of rough,
so I thought I'd rebuild the carburetor.\\
273 - But I was waiting at The Hub.\\
274 - Well, you want a smooth ride,
don't you?\\
275 - I just think\\
276 - that if you say you're gonna be
someplace, that you should be there.\\
277 - Oh, man, I guess I flaked.\\
278 - I've just got this thing where
a lot of times I don't show up.\\
279 - I don't know
what to do about it.\\
280 - How about showing up?\\
281 - I guess I could
give that a shot.\\
282 - So this will never happen again?\\
283 - No, I'm pretty sure
it'll happen again.\\
284 - But we'll light that
firecracker when we come to it.\\
285 - Fair enough.\\
286 - I can't believe this. When I
got here, I was so mad at you\\
287 - and I already
totally forgave you.\\
288 - Yeah. Everybody does.\\
289 - I'm sorry, miss,
but I can't give it to you.\\
290 - The donor himself is the only one
who has legal rights over the specimen.\\
291 - Fine!\\
292 - Michael, you get them!\\
293 - You're the only one who has
rights over your "special men."\\
294 - Jackie, what do you care
what I do with my special men?\\
295 - Specimen. I said, "Specimen."\\
296 - I care because if there are
gonna be any little Kelso babies,\\
297 - well, I want them to be ours.\\
298 - Oh.\\
299 - - You want to have my children?
- Well, yeah.\\
300 - I mean, if you get rich and don't
lose your hair, because I love you.\\
301 - I love you, too.\\
302 - You can't do that here.\\
303 - Oh, she's right.
Yeah, we'll be in Room 2.\\
304 - - Dad.
- Oh, crap.\\
305 - I was hoping that you wouldn't
find me back here.\\
306 - Well, that's a good
icebreaker. Look, um,\\
307 - about the "love" incident...\\
308 - All right. Stop right there.\\
309 - There are only
a few times in life\\
310 - when it's acceptable for a man
to use that phrase.\\
311 - When he's drunk, when he's dying\\
312 - or when he's in big trouble
and that's the only way out.\\
313 - Which usually means he's drunk.\\
314 - - So, other than that...
- Other than that,\\
315 - it's just a given.\\
316 - Oh.\\
317 - Hey, you just kind of told me...\\
318 - No, I didn't.\\
319 - - Yes, you did.
- Well, I'm drunk.\\
320 - Clearly, I'm drunk.\\
321 - Daddy, be my Valentine.\\
322 - Do I have to hit you?
Go to your room.\\
323 - Okay.\\
324 - Good news!\\
325 - My boys are back
in friendly hands.\\
326 - Ironically, that's just where
they started their journey.\\
327 - That's a shame, Kelso.\\
328 - It's the one job I knew you
could've been a success at.\\
329 - Thanks, Hyde.\\
330 - Kelso, get that nasty bag of
genetics out of my basement.\\
331 - This bag?\\
332 - Ahhh! Burn!
It's just a big bag of candy.\\
333 - Candy? What kind of candy?
\subsection {Episode 18: Leo Loves Kitty}
1 - Hey, you guys! Great news!\\
2 - I was walking around
Halverson's department store,\\
3 - and the owner comes right up to
me, and he offered me a modeling job.\\
4 - Yeah.\\
5 - Whoo!\\
6 - Wait, wait. He just offered
you a modeling job?\\
7 - Yeah,
sounds a little suspicious.\\
8 - I mean, how do you know
it was the owner?\\
9 - Because it was Mr. Halverson.\\
10 - How do you know it
was Mr. Halverson?\\
11 - Because I said,
"Aren't you Mr. Halverson?"\\
12 - And he said, "Yeah."\\
13 - Hey, Hyde,
aren't you Mr. Halverson?\\
14 - Yeah.\\
15 - See? Look, Michael. I've been
in that store over a hundred times,\\
16 - and Mr. Halverson
never asked me to be a model.\\
17 - And if Mr. Halverson
never asked me to be a model,\\
18 - then there's no Mr. Halverson.\\
19 - It's a scam.\\
20 - I don't know. It doesn't sound
like a scam to me.\\
21 - Thank you, Donna.\\
22 - Sounds like Mr. Halverson
wants you for his lover.\\
23 - Either way, I'm flattered.\\
24 - Hyde, will you teach me
how to drive the El Camino?\\
25 - Rhonda's car is a stick,
and until I learn to drive it,\\
26 - I have to sit in the lady seat.\\
27 - - No way, man. The Camino's cherry.
- Please?\\
28 - - No.
- Please, please, please?\\
29 - No.\\
30 - Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,\\
31 - please, please, please,
please, please, please, please...\\
32 - Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,\\
33 - please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please,\\
34 - - please, please,
please, please...
- All right! All right!\\
35 - You can use the El Camino.\\
36 - But you have to be careful,
all right?\\
37 - I don't want anything to
happen to my baby.\\
38 - Aw, thanks for your concern,
Hyde, but I'll be fine.\\
39 - And let the clutch out
gently, okay?\\
40 - - This car's very powerful.
- Hyde.\\
41 - We've been sitting here
for half an hour.\\
42 - Will you just shut your hole
and let me drive?\\
43 - Okay, you're clear.\\
44 - In front of you.\\
45 - Man, I picked a bad place
to take a nap.\\
46 - Hanging out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - Hey, Todd, I'm gonna take my
break now. Michael's stopping by.\\
56 - Still dating that guy?\\
57 - I guess that's fine,
if you like the handsome type.\\
58 - But does he have a picture of himself
with the guy who played Chewbacca?\\
59 - 'Cause I do.\\
60 - Hey, Jackie!
More great modeling news.\\
61 - They're starting me
in underwear.\\
62 - Look, I got a W-4 and a
body-waxing kit and everything.\\
63 - Oh.\\
64 - So you're really
an underwear model?\\
65 - No, not just underwear, briefs.\\
66 - I mean, usually, you have to spend
a year cutting your teeth in boxers\\
67 - before you even get
into the tight stuff.\\
68 - You know what? I don't
have time for this right now.\\
69 - It just isn't important.\\
70 - But, Jackie...\\
71 - Hey, maybe you
didn't hear the lady.\\
72 - She's busy.
So hit the road, guy.\\
73 - I'm her boyfriend, guy.\\
74 - Nuh-uh.\\
75 - When she works here, her boyfriend
is every man, woman, and child\\
76 - that walks in here for cheese.\\
77 - Well, I don't have
any money for cheese.\\
78 - But I'm going to go get some, and
then we'll see whose boyfriend is whose.\\
79 - Let me tell you something,
Jackie.\\
80 - As a roving associate junior manager
for Cheese Palace Incorporated,\\
81 - I've seen a lot of things.\\
82 - Some I can't talk about.\\
83 - But I will tell you two things.\\
84 - One, with the German
population that this town has,\\
85 - we should be moving
a lot more sausage.\\
86 - Two, you're a stone-cold fox.\\
87 - I've said too much.
I'll be in the cooler.\\
88 - Now, if your gown
falls open again,\\
89 - there's no need to ring
the little buzzer.\\
90 - You can just cover up
by yourself.\\
91 - Okay, um, I'll be right back
with your blankie.\\
92 - Thankie.\\
93 - Leo, I'm so sorry I hurt you.\\
94 - That's all right, man.
I'll be fine.\\
95 - Least I still
got it all up here.\\
96 - But that's just good genes, man.\\
97 - My father had
a good hairline, too.\\
98 - Well, nice job, Fez.\\
99 - The fender's dented, the taillight's
shot, so you owe me 80 bucks.\\
100 - Okay, good luck with that.\\
101 - I'm broke.\\
102 - Well, like my mom used to tell me,
"Shut up and give me some money!"\\
103 - Hey, you guys,
I was just next door,\\
104 - and you know that weird kid from
school who's always saying he can fly?\\
105 - Yeah, he can't.\\
106 - So, Leo, how's the hospital?\\
107 - Oh, it's great, man.\\
108 - Cable TV, free parking,\\
109 - don't have to get out of bed
to take a pee.\\
110 - It's just like a hotel.\\
111 - And Nurse Kitty and I have had
some good times.\\
112 - Chances are\\
113 - 'Cause I wear a silly grin\\
114 - The moment
you come into view\\
115 - Chances are you'll think\\
116 - That I'm in love with you\\
117 - Okay, Leo, I'm going to
get you a surprise dessert.\\
118 - It jiggles\\
119 - and it rhymes
with "Jerry cello."\\
120 - I love you, too, Kitty.\\
121 - I love you, too.\\
122 - Chances are\\
123 - Silly grin\\
124 - Hey, Eric, where's Donna?\\
125 - Oh, she's out
with Kelso's brother.\\
126 - Which means it's only a matter of time
before she calls us from the holding cell.\\
127 - Well, I need a woman's opinion.\\
128 - Eh, you're close enough. Look.\\
129 - I'm just really upset
about Michael modeling.\\
130 - I mean, that was our dream.
Together.\\
131 - But for me!\\
132 - There's a fragrance
that's here today\\
133 - And they call it Jackie\\
134 - A flashy scent
for your nasal caves\\
135 - And they call it Jackie\\
136 - Kind of new,
kind of now, Jackie\\
137 - Kind of free,
kind of wow, Jackie\\
138 - You won't be pretty
like Jackie is\\
139 - But you'll smell like Jackie\\
140 - Yeah\\
141 - Wait, so, um, in your dream,
you're a model, and Kelso's, um,\\
142 - not there.\\
143 - Whereas in real life,
Kelso's a model, and you, um,\\
144 - sell cheese.\\
145 - That is delightful.\\
146 - Hey, Red.\\
147 - Could you give these
to your wife, please?\\
148 - And tell her I love her.\\
149 - - I'll give her the message.
- Thank you.\\
150 - Oh, boy!\\
151 - You got a date for
the stoners' ball.\\
152 - "Roses are red. Violets
are blue. Milk, eggs, coffee."\\
153 - Who's the most
handsome man on earth?\\
154 - U-R.\\
155 - Michael, I've thought about
your modeling job,\\
156 - and I came to a decision.\\
157 - I can't let you take
your pants off in public.\\
158 - But I take my pants off
in public all the time.\\
159 - You never said anything before.\\
160 - Because before, you weren't doing
it for your glamorous new career.\\
161 - You were doing it for the love
of being pantsless.\\
162 - So, now promise me
you won't do it.\\
163 - - Michael?
- Fine.\\
164 - I plomise.\\
165 - I heard that.\\
166 - You said, "I plomise."\\
167 - There is no "L" in promise.\\
168 - Michael, promise me
with an "R."\\
169 - Fine! I promise.\\
170 - Okay, you promise to what?\\
171 - I promise I won't
model my undelwear.\\
172 - Michael!\\
173 - Oh, fine!\\
174 - - That jerk.
- He really is a jerk.\\
175 - And you smell nice.\\
176 - So?\\
177 - Does it make you
wanna buy underwear?\\
178 - No, it makes me wonder who
this guy is you're massaging.\\
179 - That's Daryl.\\
180 - And we're not massaging.
It's posing.\\
181 - Shut up.\\
182 - God, he's got a girlfriend.
I've got a girlfriend.\\
183 - Yeah, and her name is Daryl.\\
184 - Hey, Fez.\\
185 - Got that 80 bucks yet
for the El Camino?\\
186 - As a matter of fact, I do
happen to not have it yet.\\
187 - Well, why don't I hold on
to this until you do?\\
188 - My candy.\\
189 - You'll get your 80 bucks.\\
190 - In hell!\\
191 - Hey, Jackie, how's it going?\\
192 - You know, Michael, not so good.\\
193 - You lied to me
and you stole my dream.\\
194 - How's it going besides that?\\
195 - You knew I always
wanted to be a model,\\
196 - and you took the job anyways.\\
197 - I mean, if Mr. Halverson had
offered me a job as a spaceman,\\
198 - I would have said no,
'cause that's your dream.\\
199 - I thought that out of everyone,\\
200 - that you would be the one
to be happy for me,\\
201 - 'cause you're
supposed to love me.\\
202 - Well, if that's what
you expected from me,\\
203 - then obviously
you don't know me very well.\\
204 - Okay.\\
205 - Well, when you're ready to apologize,
I'll be downstairs modeling stuff.\\
206 - But, Michael...\\
207 - Oh, damn!\\
208 - Man, if I was your boyfriend,
I'd be giving up modeling for you,\\
209 - and then taking it back up again,
just so I could give it up again.\\
210 - Well, I'm off to the Fotohut.\\
211 - Hope my new boyfriend
doesn't try to make a pass at me.\\
212 - I don't think we have
to worry about that.\\
213 - I see.\\
214 - Kitty, I just mean
the whole thing is so silly.\\
215 - It's just so silly.
It's silly.\\
216 - Well, it didn't
used to be silly.\\
217 - I remember a time when you'd
beat up a guy just for looking at me.\\
218 - Oh, come on, Kitty. I'm not
worried about you and other guys.\\
219 - I mean, you're a little old
for crushes.\\
220 - What?\\
221 - Oh, I didn't mean "old."\\
222 - I meant advanced in beauty.\\
223 - Hey.
Michael and I had a fight.\\
224 - Maybe if we pretend
she's not here, she'll just\\
225 - go away.\\
226 - - I've tried. It doesn't work.
- Hmm.\\
227 - Look, he actually
stood up to me.\\
228 - Things are changing between us.\\
229 - I just don't know how to
keep them the same.\\
230 - I mean, he's not just modeling.\\
231 - He's, like, leaving me behind.\\
232 - Look, Jackie, you just...\\
233 - You can't keep
trying to control him.\\
234 - Yeah, that's how Eric
ran me off.\\
235 - Yep, that's...\\
236 - Thank you. Thank you for that.\\
237 - Look, Jackie.\\
238 - Take it from a guy
who pretty much\\
239 - hasn't been to second base
in over two months.\\
240 - You gotta let him
have his own life.\\
241 - You know,
maybe you guys are right.\\
242 - Maybe the only way to keep
someone you love is by letting them go.\\
243 - You know,
a teacher told me that once.\\
244 - But she had grown-up braces,
so I didn't listen.\\
245 - Oh, no.\\
246 - Yep, it's me.\\
247 - Hey, is my lady around?\\
248 - Leo, buddy, we gotta talk.\\
249 - You're getting me in a lot
of trouble around here.\\
250 - - Now, I'm begging you...
- Who is it, Red?\\
251 - Listen, hophead!\\
252 - I love that woman
with a fiery passion\\
253 - that consumes my soul!
That's right!\\
254 - So you can either
walk out of here on your own,\\
255 - or you can hop out of here
with my boot in your ass!\\
256 - Okay, I choose the one
with nothing in my ass.\\
257 - Good choice!\\
258 - Well, Red,\\
259 - that was a pretty good show
you put on there.\\
260 - You poured it on with a fiery
passion that consumed your soul.\\
261 - Hey, if you think I'm putting on a
show to get out of the doghouse,\\
262 - you're way off-base.\\
263 - If I wanted to get out of trouble,
I'd just tell you how pretty you look,\\
264 - which I've been
meaning to tell you.\\
265 - You do.\\
266 - - Oh, stow it.
- Oh, fine.\\
267 - But, Kitty,
you gotta understand.\\
268 - If I got mad at every guy that
looked at you, I'd drive myself crazy.\\
269 - I don't even wanna think about all
those patients down at the hospital\\
270 - making googly eyes at you!\\
271 - Not to mention the doctors.\\
272 - Don't get me started
on those perverts!\\
273 - They think the nursing staff is
their own personal dating service!\\
274 - Glorified plumbers!\\
275 - Okay.\\
276 - All right, Red.
You're getting very upset.\\
277 - In fact,
you look downright miserable.\\
278 - That makes me so happy.\\
279 - Hey, Donna. I just went to
the store. Check out my new\\
280 - empty bag.\\
281 - Empty bag, huh?\\
282 - If it's empty,
why are you so excited?\\
283 - Oh, well, because of its
amazing potential for storage.\\
284 - Storage, huh?\\
285 - It better be storing
an El Camino taillight.\\
286 - Candy again?\\
287 - You sick bastard!\\
288 - You keep your distance,
scallywag.\\
289 - Hey!
If you guys don't shut up,\\
290 - the phrase "empty bag" is gonna
take on a whole new meaning for you.\\
291 - - Huh?
- What?\\
292 - It's a thinker.\\
293 - But trust me,
you don't want it to happen.\\
294 - Now, Hyde, you want money.
Fez doesn't have it.\\
295 - So we just need to think of something
Fez can give you that's worth 80 bucks.\\
296 - $18 is your change.
Have a nice day.\\
297 - Now, I know totally nude Fez
isn't original,\\
298 - but everyone seems to be happy.\\
299 - I'm happy.\\
300 - I'm happy, too.\\
301 - Hey, man,
remember the 3-foot rule.\\
302 - All right.
I'll stay right over here.\\
303 - Great. Okay, the ball's your best
friend. Give it a big smile. Great.\\
304 - Now you're mad at the ball.
"Oh, I hate you, bad ball."\\
305 - Great.\\
306 - Oh.\\
307 - Didn't expect to see you here.\\
308 - Well, I didn't expect to come.\\
309 - But I did a lot
of thinking and...\\
310 - No, no. What is it now?\\
311 - You want me to drop
out of high school?\\
312 - Join the Salvation Army
and go off and fight wars?\\
313 - I came here to talk to you\\
314 - - about your modeling and...
- Yeah, Jackie,\\
315 - I don't have time for it right
now. It just isn't important.\\
316 - Sound familiar? Oh, yeah.\\
317 - - You should go now.
- Wait, but...\\
318 - Okay.
Hey, let's build a sandcastle.\\
319 - Oh, and it's your favorite
thing in the world. Great!\\
320 - Hey, some jerk just
kicked it over. Boo-hoo-hoo.\\
321 - Great.\\
322 - Todd, what are you doing here?\\
323 - I saw you fighting with Michael.\\
324 - I thought there
might be a problem.\\
325 - Even though I really hope there's
not a problem. Is there a problem?\\
326 - Yeah, I think so.\\
327 - Well, you know what would
make you feel better?\\
328 - Coming to see a movie with me.\\
329 - You know what?\\
330 - Yeah. Yeah, let's go.\\
331 - Mr. Forman, Mrs. Forman.
How may I help you?\\
332 - You can help me
by getting some pants on.\\
333 - And for the lady?\\
334 - I'll have what he's having.\\
335 - Say, don't come to
my house anymore.\\
336 - Go, honey, go!
\subsection {Episode 19: Jackie's Cheese Squeeze}
1 - Jackie, you clocked out
half an hour ago.\\
2 - Did you come back
to tell me something?\\
3 - Because I feel the same way.\\
4 - I was waiting outside
for Michael to pick me up,\\
5 - but the idiot never showed.\\
6 - That's the third time this week.\\
7 - Three strikes and he's out,
according to the rules of baseball,\\
8 - and love.\\
9 - Actually, it's four strikes, if you
count the time he showed up late\\
10 - 'cause he had to see
how The Jetsons ended.\\
11 - Man, first he goes behind your
back and takes that modeling job,\\
12 - and now this
whole Jetsons thing?\\
13 - No futuristic cartoon
could ever keep me from you.\\
14 - I just don't know
what's happening to us.\\
15 - Okay.
Jackie, you need to cheer up.\\
16 - And the first step to cheering
up is giving Todd a hug.\\
17 - Oh, my God.\\
18 - Oh, my God.\\
19 - I am so glad
I went shopping today.\\
20 - Hanging out\\
21 - Down the street\\
22 - The same old thing\\
23 - We did last week\\
24 - Not a thing to do\\
25 - But talk to you\\
26 - We're all all right\\
27 - We're all all right\\
28 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
29 - - What do I do?
- Run like the wind!\\
30 - Eric!\\
31 - Did you get a haircut?
'Cause I love it.\\
32 - You look just like
Parker Stevenson.\\
33 - Oh, really? 'Cause I told
the guy that he should...\\
34 - No, no, no! That's not
gonna work, tramp-face.\\
35 - I saw tongue.\\
36 - Okay, Eric, I know you and I
don't have the best relationship.\\
37 - - You mean,
I hate you, and you hate me?
- Right.\\
38 - So, let's turn over a new leaf\\
39 - by you never telling Michael
what you think you just saw.\\
40 - Hmm.\\
41 - Or I could just torture you with
this information until I'm bored.\\
42 - Eric!\\
43 - Okay, you know what?
I'll make you a deal.\\
44 - You can buy two guaranteed
hours of silence\\
45 - by carving this wheel of cheddar
into a handsome likeness of me.\\
46 - And, go.\\
47 - - Red, dinner's ready.
- Five more minutes, Kitty.\\
48 - A bunch of birds threw a
"crap on my Corvette" party.\\
49 - If I don't get it out, the
paint will oxidize. Oxidize!\\
50 - Well, why don't you just
put the car in the garage?\\
51 - Because if I put the car in the garage,
I can't see it from the dinner table.\\
52 - Kitty, don't give advice about
things you don't understand.\\
53 - Okay. I'm the crazy one.\\
54 - Well, let's just go ahead
and eat.\\
55 - Oh, we're not doing that yet?\\
56 - You know, ever since
Red got his new car,\\
57 - he can barely tear himself
away from it.\\
58 - You better watch out, Kitty, or
you're gonna end up a Corvette widow.\\
59 - Oh, no, he loves that car.
He deserves it.\\
60 - The last treat he bought
himself was a pellet gun\\
61 - to shoot the chipmunks that
were stealing our tomatoes.\\
62 - And I had to throw that away, because
it was giving him war nightmares.\\
63 - I'm glad you threw it out.
That thing hurt.\\
64 - Kitty, I know what
I'm talking about.\\
65 - As soon as my ex-husband got a
boat, it was like he forgot I even existed.\\
66 - So I divorced him,
took the boat,\\
67 - and spent a vigorous three-day
weekend on it with the harbor master.\\
68 - I don't think
that's kitchen talk.\\
69 - Okay, okay.\\
70 - I saw Jackie making out with
the guy from the cheese shop!\\
71 - The little dude.\\
72 - No way!\\
73 - Yup. But you're the only one I
told, so don't say a word to anyone.\\
74 - Okay, my little secret squirrel?\\
75 - My lips are sealed.\\
76 - Good. 'Cause I knew
I could count on you.\\
77 - You always can.\\
78 - Think about it.\\
79 - We hold information\\
80 - that could crush the very heart
and soul of one of our best friends.\\
81 - I live for days like this!\\
82 - Oh, but just remember,
you're the only one I told.\\
83 - Your secret's
safe with me.\\
84 - Well, you missed a nice dinner.\\
85 - Joanne said the funniest thing.\\
86 - She said I was gonna end up
a Corvette widow.\\
87 - Isn't that a kick?\\
88 - Oh, Kitty, I wouldn't
leave you for the car.\\
89 - Who'd make dinner?\\
90 - Oh, no.\\
91 - I think it's the time
to prove Joanne wrong.\\
92 - How are you gonna
prove Joanne wrong?\\
93 - What surprising and thoughtful deed
are you gonna do to prove Joanne wrong?\\
94 - I'm gonna prove Joanne wrong\\
95 - by taking you out\\
96 - on a special date\\
97 - - soon. Tomorrow.
- Good answer!\\
98 - Oh, hey, guys. It's Kelso's
loyal girlfriend, Jackie.\\
99 - Hi, Jackie.\\
100 - Okay, I'm not here to stay. I just
came to get Michael. Come on.\\
101 - Oh, no, stay. We're just
gonna hang out and fool around.\\
102 - We all know how much you like to\\
103 - fool around.\\
104 - Okay, Michael, come on.
Let's go to The Hub.\\
105 - No, I want to stay here
and fool around.\\
106 - So, hey, Jackie, how's it
going down at the cheese shop?\\
107 - You must be so tired from
giving it away at the mall.\\
108 - What are you laughing at?\\
109 - I don't know.
What are you laughing at?\\
110 - I don't know.\\
111 - - What are you laughing at?
- What are you laughing at?\\
112 - I don't know.\\
113 - What are you laughing at?\\
114 - I really don't know.\\
115 - - Come on, Michael. Let's go.
- No, let's stay.\\
116 - We could play Monopoly.\\
117 - Oh, but that wouldn't be
much fun, since we all know that\\
118 - Jackie cheats.\\
119 - I do not!\\
120 - Oh, you do cheat.
We've all caught you.\\
121 - Red, this is supposed to be
our special date.\\
122 - There is nothing special
about an auto show!\\
123 - Oh, no?\\
124 - How about it's special 'cause
you're the only woman here.\\
125 - You're the queen
of the auto show!\\
126 - - Lord, grant me
the serenity to accept...
- Oh, come on, Kitty.\\
127 - It'll be fun.\\
128 - You're always saying how we
should share each other's interests.\\
129 - I only said that to get you
to go to the figurine festival.\\
130 - Okay, I do. I want us to share
our interests, so I'll start.\\
131 - Teach me about cars.\\
132 - I'm excited!\\
133 - That's my girl.\\
134 - Holy crap.\\
135 - Look at the paint job
on that T-Bird.\\
136 - Wait here. I'll be right back.\\
137 - Wait, wait. Wait here?\\
138 - Well, someone's
gotta guard the car.\\
139 - Who better than the queen?\\
140 - Not on the bumper!\\
141 - Oh, Jackie, great. Just
the person I was looking for.\\
142 - Look, I've got this itch\\
143 - right above my shoulder.
Be a good girl.\\
144 - Give a little scratch.\\
145 - Eric, I came here to talk to you
about what happened yesterday.\\
146 - Okay, but I can't hear you
if you're not scratching.\\
147 - Yeah!\\
148 - Things between me and Michael
have been weird lately.\\
149 - And when Todd kissed me, I guess
I just gave in 'cause I felt vulnerable.\\
150 - But I made a terrible mistake.\\
151 - And I was hoping you'd show me
some compassion.\\
152 - Compassion.\\
153 - Wait, is that the feeling you get
when someone just shined your shoes?\\
154 - Because if so, you are in luck.\\
155 - And, go.\\
156 - You know what?\\
157 - I don't think so.\\
158 - See, I may have kissed Todd,\\
159 - but you knew about it all
along and didn't tell Michael.\\
160 - And that is way worse
than what I did.\\
161 - - Wait, what?
- Yeah.\\
162 - See, girlfriends are supposed
to lie. That's what we do.\\
163 - But best friends are supposed
to be loyal, and you weren't.\\
164 - So guess what?\\
165 - You're screwed, 'cause I'm
telling Michael everything!\\
166 - You wouldn't.\\
167 - Oh, I so would.\\
168 - - Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!\\
169 - - Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!\\
170 - Well... Well... Well, this
certainly blew up in my face!\\
171 - When I tell Michael what you did,
he's gonna forget all about what I did.\\
172 - Unless I get to him first.\\
173 - You wouldn't.\\
174 - Well, to quote a certain
manager-kissing cheese maiden I know,\\
175 - "I so would!"\\
176 - And, go!\\
177 - - Not here.
- Damn it.\\
178 - Okay, Todd.
Look, I know we kissed,\\
179 - and it was probably, like,
the best kiss you'll ever have.\\
180 - But it didn't mean anything,
and nothing's gonna come of it.\\
181 - So you're gonna
have to get over me.\\
182 - Oh, and you know what?
Please don't fire me,\\
183 - because I really need this job.\\
184 - Okay? Great. See you tomorrow.\\
185 - Look, Kelso, I am so sorry.\\
186 - - Get out of my way.
- Wait, Michael.\\
187 - - Great. He hates me, right?
- No. He hates me.\\
188 - We didn't even talk about you.\\
189 - I mean, I told him about the
kiss, and he just stormed off.\\
190 - I couldn't even tell him
I'm sorry.\\
191 - Okay, well...\\
192 - I'm not going to feel
sorry for you, so...\\
193 - Yeah.
I mean, you can't make me.\\
194 - I just love him so much.\\
195 - Oh, God.\\
196 - Okay, look. Jackie.\\
197 - It's just one kiss, right?
That's not so bad.\\
198 - Just tell Kelso
what you told me about,\\
199 - you know, how you felt
vulnerable and stuff.\\
200 - He doesn't even want to see me.\\
201 - So, you know what?\\
202 - We'll go hang out in my basement
and wait for him to come by.\\
203 - He left his bouncy ball there, so, you
know, he's bound to be by sometime.\\
204 - You'd do that for me?\\
205 - As long as you promise
not to rat me out.\\
206 - Deal.\\
207 - So, friends?\\
208 - As long as you promise not
to tell people we're friends.\\
209 - You guys are never
gonna believe this.\\
210 - Jackie cheated on me.\\
211 - With the cheese guy!\\
212 - No!\\
213 - Yeah. I was just
as shocked as you are.\\
214 - Well, thank God
all she did was kiss him.\\
215 - Yeah.\\
216 - Wait. How do you know
all she did was kiss him?\\
217 - Kiss?\\
218 - I didn't say kiss.\\
219 - Don't make fun of my accent.\\
220 - That cheese guy's lucky he's
a little fellow, or I'd kick his ass.\\
221 - Just boom! Right in the ass!\\
222 - Hey, man,
you gotta kick his ass.\\
223 - Like, on Fantasy Island,\\
224 - if Tattoo took one of
Mr. Roarke's women\\
225 - up to his little tower
and put it to her,\\
226 - Roarke would slap that little
dude like a drunk Southern widow!\\
227 - Then he'd hit him off
with some vicious voodoo.\\
228 - Yeah. Voodoo on Tattoo.\\
229 - Voodoo. Tattoo.\\
230 - Peekaboo.\\
231 - Honeydew. Kung fu.\\
232 - Koo-koo-ka-choo.\\
233 - I'm done.\\
234 - Well, look who's finally back.\\
235 - While you were gone, some guy came
by to compliment me on my headlights.\\
236 - Pretty sure he wasn't
talking about the car.\\
237 - I got us funnel cakes!\\
238 - It's like a second honeymoon.\\
239 - Kitty, not in the car.\\
240 - Hey, nice 'vette.\\
241 - You should come see
the custom job I did on mine.\\
242 - Cost me $3,000 and a marriage.\\
243 - - $3,000?
- And a marriage!\\
244 - I'll only be a minute, Kitty.\\
245 - What are you
looking at, gear-head?\\
246 - Your ass is mine, cheese puff!\\
247 - How did you know my nickname?\\
248 - Wait, your nickname's
Cheese Puff?\\
249 - Stay focused. Kick his ass!\\
250 - Yeah, right. Good. Yeah.\\
251 - What do you think you're doing
kissing my girlfriend, huh? Huh?\\
252 - Well, maybe if you paid more
attention to that gorgeous creature\\
253 - than your little modeling gig,
it wouldn't have happened.\\
254 - Little?\\
255 - That picture sold hundreds of young men's
briefs all over the greater Kenosha area!\\
256 - It's true. I bought
three pairs. Very supportive.\\
257 - Yeah, so look.\\
258 - I know you're a little fellow,\\
259 - but I can't let you go around
kissing my girlfriend.\\
260 - So you're gonna have
to take a punch.\\
261 - I understand.\\
262 - That didn't look like
it hurt him at all.\\
263 - Well, I guess it's my turn.\\
264 - Okay. I didn't mean
to scare you, little guy.\\
265 - I'm a black belt.\\
266 - All right!
Didn't see that coming.\\
267 - Thanks to your
funnel cake accident,\\
268 - I'll have to spend half the
night cleaning out the car.\\
269 - Well, I hope you two
will be very happy together.\\
270 - Mrs. Forman!\\
271 - Mrs. Forman, I have
a black eye, and I need ice!\\
272 - I'm not doing anything else
for men today.\\
273 - Just go away.\\
274 - No. I'm not gonna go away.\\
275 - I'm having a really bad day.\\
276 - I got decked by a guy who
kissed Jackie. He was huge.\\
277 - And she thinks
that it was okay to kiss him,\\
278 - because I've been ignoring
her for work, which I barely did.\\
279 - And I got a black eye, and I
need someone to care about me!\\
280 - Well, well, well.\\
281 - Michael ignored Jackie,
and she kissed another boy.\\
282 - That is completely different!\\
283 - He ignored her for a stupid job.\\
284 - I ignored you for a car.\\
285 - Crap.\\
286 - Oh, burn.\\
287 - How many times
you want to get hit today?\\
288 - Kitty, I'm sorry.\\
289 - Next time, I'll be happy
to forget about the car\\
290 - and go to whatever figurine,\\
291 - quilting, macrame,
man-killing thing you want to do.\\
292 - Actually, there's a knitting bee
at the community center right now.\\
293 - You're kidding.\\
294 - And you know what they say
about those knitters,\\
295 - "They spin quite a yarn!"\\
296 - You know what would really
teach me a lesson?\\
297 - Leaving me at home to, you
know, think about what I've done.\\
298 - If you're not in that car in two seconds,
I'll make you carry my knitting basket.\\
299 - Coming, dear.\\
300 - Wait, wait, wait.
So Kelso got beat up?\\
301 - Yeah, by the little dude
at the cheese shop.\\
302 - It was awesome, man.\\
303 - Like a hurricane of tiny fists.\\
304 - All right, look.
Jackie, here's the deal.\\
305 - You cheated on me.\\
306 - You used to cheat on me
all the time.\\
307 - Yeah?\\
308 - Well, yeah.\\
309 - But you cheated out of hate,
and I cheated out of joy.\\
310 - I didn't cheat out of hate,
Michael.\\
311 - I cheated because lately you've
been acting like I don't exist.\\
312 - Well, I sure know you exist now
that you frenched the whole mall!\\
313 - Look, I know that I need to
pay more attention to you,\\
314 - and I want to forgive you,\\
315 - but I have all this anger built up
inside of me and nowhere to put it.\\
316 - Eric knew about the kiss
all along and didn't tell you.\\
317 - You knew?\\
318 - - Jackie.
- What'd you expect?\\
319 - You're a dead man, Forman.\\
320 - Get him, Michael.\\
321 - Well, guys, uh,
just so you're up to speed,\\
322 - I knew about the kiss all along.\\
323 - Eric told me.\\
324 - He made me his secret squirrel.\\
325 - What?\\
326 - That dillhole said
I was the only one he told.\\
327 - - Me, too!
- Me, too!\\
328 - It was hilarious.
You guys should've seen it.\\
329 - Kelso's foot got stuck in
a gopher hole, and... And...\\
330 - Why are you guys
all looking at me like that?\\
331 - I was your secret squirrel,
you son of a bitch!\\
332 - Get him!\\
333 - The '58's the only one
with the chrome detail.\\
334 - Mmm.\\
335 - Men and cars.
Never got it, never will.
\subsection {Episode 20: Class Picture}
1 - Now, Michael. Michael,
for your yearbook picture,\\
2 - don't forget to do the over-the-shoulder
shot. That's the best one.\\
3 - Oh, yeah. I love that pose.\\
4 - It makes me look coy.\\
5 - Ha.\\
6 - Hey, guys, Tommy Hedges
just got his picture taken\\
7 - with a big, old booger.\\
8 - So, why were you
in Tommy Hedges' picture?\\
9 - So, wait. He had a booger,
and you didn't tell him?\\
10 - He'll find out.
It'll be in the yearbook.\\
11 - It's true. That's how I
found out I was adorable.\\
12 - No, seriously.\\
13 - The only thing more important
than your yearbook picture\\
14 - is your yearbook quote.\\
15 - I already got that covered.\\
16 - My quote's gonna be, "What
a long, strange trip it's been".\\
17 - Yeah, that's freaking profound.\\
18 - Kelso, every lame-o hippie\\
19 - in the history of time
has used that quote.\\
20 - Well, yeah.
That's 'cause it's good.\\
21 - No, Michael. Your quote has
to be meaningful,\\
22 - so you can
remember the good times\\
23 - when you're, like, 30,
with no reason left to live.\\
24 - Okay,
hidden in Jackie's extremely\\
25 - disturbing thought
is a grain of truth.\\
26 - We need a really
good quote this year.\\
27 - Well, all the best quotes are
about things that mean a lot to you.\\
28 - Like, for example, me.\\
29 - Or my hair, or my personality,\\
30 - or the sparkle I bring
to your dull, grey lives.\\
31 - Or the feeling of relief we
get when you leave the room.\\
32 - No. You know what? We
need a quote about all of us.\\
33 - Like, maybe, like,
how we all met.\\
34 - Remember how we first met?\\
35 - Oh, is this a sexy story?\\
36 - It's really more sad than sexy.\\
37 - Yeah.\\
38 - That's pretty much
how it goes for you, isn't it?\\
39 - Yeah.\\
40 - Okay, now, got your brownies
for the new neighbors, Eric?\\
41 - Yes, Mommy.\\
42 - How do I look?\\
43 - Well,
you got a little something...\\
44 - Don't touch it!\\
45 - I had to sleep sitting
up to keep it like this.\\
46 - Well, I just hope these new
neighbors are better than the last one.\\
47 - That Gus Griffin was
a complete dumbass.\\
48 - Hiya, neighbors!\\
49 - Well, hello. We were just
coming to welcome you.\\
50 - Looks like we beat you
to the punchity-punch.\\
51 - Oh, damn.\\
52 - I'm Bob Pinciotti.
This is my daughter, Donna.\\
53 - My wife Midge'll be over later.\\
54 - Her thumb's caught
in something right now.\\
55 - Well, we've all done that.\\
56 - I guess.\\
57 - Well, I'm Kitty,
and this is Red,\\
58 - and this is our son Eric.\\
59 - Eric, say hello to Donna.\\
60 - What are you
looking at, string bean?\\
61 - Wow.\\
62 - You're strong.\\
63 - Hanging out\\
64 - Down the street\\
65 - The same old thing\\
66 - We did last week\\
67 - Not a thing to do\\
68 - But talk to you\\
69 - We're all all right\\
70 - We're all all right\\
71 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
72 - That's... Yeah,
go ahead and laugh.\\
73 - None of you were punched
by Madam Man-fist here.\\
74 - But you were creepy.
What can I say?\\
75 - Forman beat up by a girl.\\
76 - Seems like only yesterday.\\
77 - Oh, wait. I think it
happened yesterday, too.\\
78 - That's... You like
that story, Hyde?\\
79 - Maybe I should talk about
the first time you and I met.\\
80 - - No.
- Yes.\\
81 - - No! You promised!
- Yes. I'm telling!\\
82 - Thanks for
walking me home, Steven.\\
83 - That redheaded girl
hits really hard.\\
84 - Some advice? Never let a girl
stand on your head like that.\\
85 - Bad for the rep.\\
86 - Okay, Steven.\\
87 - And it's Hyde.\\
88 - Thanks, Hyde.\\
89 - Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if my last name was Seek?\\
90 - You know, Hyde and Seek!\\
91 - That's stupid.\\
92 - And you owe me a quarter.\\
93 - Well, now.
Who do we have here?\\
94 - This is Hyde.\\
95 - Oh, you have
a new little friend.\\
96 - Red, get the camera.\\
97 - I'm not his friend.
I'm a hired gun.\\
98 - Kitty, don't embarrass the boy.\\
99 - Oh, don't be silly. It's
nice to have a new friend.\\
100 - Especially one who's so dirty.\\
101 - You know what's fun?\\
102 - I'm sorry, Son.\\
103 - If you ever tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.\\
104 - Now I have to kill you.\\
105 - I don't know.
I like to bathe with friends.\\
106 - They can reach places you can't.\\
107 - Yeah. That's probably
best kept to yourself, buddy.\\
108 - You guys, look at
Eric's last-year's picture.\\
109 - The famous makeup-covered zit.\\
110 - Look, I just wanted one year
of clear skin to remember.\\
111 - And if that means breaking out
the old powder puff,\\
112 - so be it.\\
113 - Yeah, you've really never had
a zit-free picture.\\
114 - Remember the one on his nose?\\
115 - And the one on his lip?\\
116 - And the one on
the one on his lip?\\
117 - And the one we
thought was a second\\
118 - little alien Eric
growing out of his cheek?\\
119 - I mean no harm to your planet.\\
120 - I will attack if
you attempt to pop me.\\
121 - Ah, zits.\\
122 - Hey, those days are over, okay?\\
123 - I'm zit-free this year,
and you wanna know why?\\
124 - I have become a man.\\
125 - No, I'm serious.
I am man. I am zitless.\\
126 - Hear me roar.\\
127 - That should be
our yearbook quote.\\
128 - What about a quote from
the happiest day of our lives?\\
129 - When was that?\\
130 - The day you met me.\\
131 - Then Potsie says, "Sit on it,"\\
132 - right to the Fonz's face!\\
133 - Now, that's brave!\\
134 - Hey, what's with Donna?\\
135 - What? We're just friends.\\
136 - God, why would you even
ask that? I don't like her.\\
137 - Me and Donna? It's gross!\\
138 - Hey, man, I was just asking
why she wasn't in class today.\\
139 - Oh.\\
140 - Well, then, never mind.\\
141 - Busted!\\
142 - Help.\\
143 - Americans, please help me!\\
144 - What was that?\\
145 - It's coming from in here.\\
146 - Oh. Hello.\\
147 - Who the hell are you?\\
148 - I am the new
foreign exchange student.\\
149 - The football team asked me
if I wanted to hang out.\\
150 - I shouldn't have said yes.\\
151 - I can't feel my legs.\\
152 - - What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna chuck it at him.\\
153 - No, man. Leave him alone.\\
154 - Look, man, if those jocks try to do
this to you again, just come find me.\\
155 - Thanks.\\
156 - You're my best friend.
Let's hold hands.\\
157 - No.\\
158 - Let's go.\\
159 - I'm Hyde.\\
160 - I'm Eric.\\
161 - Oh, you're the one
that loves Donna.\\
162 - I do not!\\
163 - Well, my name is...\\
164 - Okay,
I'm not gonna remember that.\\
165 - I know. Let's call
him Captain Poo-face!\\
166 - My eye! God!\\
167 - Yeah, this happens a lot.\\
168 - I'm sure it does, Donna lover.\\
169 - I forgot about Captain Poo-face!\\
170 - And I did not like her then!\\
171 - Damn!\\
172 - You know what I love
about Kelso?\\
173 - Hyde just keeps beating
the crap out of him.\\
174 - That is false!\\
175 - Name one time!\\
176 - With pleasure.\\
177 - I love mashed potatoes.\\
178 - Oh, yeah?\\
179 - Uh-oh.\\
180 - Not my eye!\\
181 - Foul.\\
182 - You know what's foul?
Your playing.\\
183 - That's my eye. God.\\
184 - - Change it back.
- No.\\
185 - Change it back.\\
186 - No.\\
187 - My eye!\\
188 - Seriously, man.
You keep hurting my eye.\\
189 - That's a terrible story.\\
190 - I'm not even in that one.\\
191 - That's what makes it good.\\
192 - Okay, people, please
remain calm. I'm still zit-free.\\
193 - I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it!\\
194 - Okay, stop goofing around.\\
195 - We need to think
of a better memory.\\
196 - What about the day I met you?
All of you.\\
197 - You're gonna like Donna.
She's pretty cool, man.\\
198 - - Hyde!
- Wow! Sorry. Wow!\\
199 - - What?
- You're right. I like her!\\
200 - No, wait! I didn't see! Wait!\\
201 - Donna?\\
202 - Now, that's a good memory.\\
203 - Or should I say "mammary"?\\
204 - I don't want to
remember that story.\\
205 - It just reminds me
that I'm the only one here\\
206 - who's never
seen Donna's jahoobs.\\
207 - Well, it's not
like you never tried.\\
208 - Oops, sorry!\\
209 - Oh, damn.\\
210 - Oops, sorry!\\
211 - Damn.\\
212 - Oops, sorry!\\
213 - Damn it!\\
214 - Hey. Speaking of boobs,\\
215 - Forman's growing one
out of his forehead.\\
216 - What?\\
217 - Oh, Eric,
your curse has returned.\\
218 - Yeah, and it needs a bra.\\
219 - Oh, yeah. Dolly Parton
called your forehead.\\
220 - She wants her boob back.\\
221 - God, I can actually
see this thing growing.\\
222 - It's like Jiffy Pop.\\
223 - My friend once,
he had this really big zit,\\
224 - and he tried to pop it,\\
225 - and all the pus went into
his brain, and it killed him.\\
226 - Really, Kelso? What friend?\\
227 - - You didn't know him.
- That's 'cause
he doesn't exist.\\
228 - 'Cause he's dead now!\\
229 - People,
we are losing focus here.\\
230 - Well, what is our quote
gonna be?\\
231 - And let's remember, our
goal is to have it be about me.\\
232 - I can't think about anything
right now except Forman's zit.\\
233 - It's hypnotic.\\
234 - It sort of follows you around
the room like the Mona Lisa.\\
235 - All right.\\
236 - Hey, you wanna know something
that's even funnier than Eric's zit?\\
237 - The day I met Jackie.\\
238 - You're Donna?
We haven't met before.\\
239 - I guess because
I'm richer than you.\\
240 - Hey, Jackie.\\
241 - That hurt, you lumberjack!\\
242 - Welcome to public school.\\
243 - I can't believe I missed that.\\
244 - You know, when you laugh,\\
245 - you get a little
wrinkle in your zit.\\
246 - It's got personality.\\
247 - Okay, well,
what am I supposed to do?\\
248 - It hurts way too much to pop.\\
249 - Come here, man. Let me see it.\\
250 - What?\\
251 - - Quit it!
- Yeah.\\
252 - Kelso's friend died that way.\\
253 - Donna, he did!\\
254 - Whatever.\\
255 - Look, all I know is there's
gotta be some good quote\\
256 - of Jackie
getting hit in the head.\\
257 - Like, "Awesome!
Jackie got hit in the head!"\\
258 - No. No, no.
That's a stupid story.\\
259 - You know, I want to remember
the happy times.\\
260 - Maybe something romantic.\\
261 - Like our first date.\\
262 - - Yeah.
- Yeah. Let me tell it.\\
263 - Red, Michael's in the fort
with another girl.\\
264 - All right. Everybody out.\\
265 - Michael Kelso, have you been
playing doctor with the Burkhart girl?\\
266 - No. I am a doctor.\\
267 - Good one.\\
268 - I mean, you're a very bad boy.\\
269 - Don't yell at him.\\
270 - I love him.\\
271 - Michael,
that was not our first date!\\
272 - Yeah,
but I got further on that day\\
273 - than I did on our
actual first date,\\
274 - so that's what I
like to remember.\\
275 - Yeah, you made a great
impression on my parents that year.\\
276 - Hi, Mr. Forman. Is Eric home?\\
277 - Yes,\\
278 - but, uh...\\
279 - Kitty?\\
280 - Oh, my.\\
281 - Michael, honey,
did you maybe forget something?\\
282 - What?\\
283 - My pants!\\
284 - Why doesn't anyone
just tell nice stories?\\
285 - Everyone can think of a quote.
I mean, why can't we?\\
286 - Why don't we use Lisa Manning's?\\
287 - "Hanging at the mall.
Kahlua and ice cream.\\
288 - "Bobby Sutton's a god. Yeah."\\
289 - God, this is so sad.\\
290 - It's like, what have we
been doing with our lives?\\
291 - Hey, Kelso,
who's got stronger powers?\\
292 - I Dream of Jeannie\\
293 - or Samantha from Bewitched?\\
294 - That's easy. Samantha.\\
295 - Witches totally beat genies,\\
296 - 'cause witches can fly.\\
297 - Game over.\\
298 - Hey, why does Jeannie wear
those see-through clothes?\\
299 - It's gross.\\
300 - And it makes me feel funny.\\
301 - No way is Samantha
hotter than Jeannie.\\
302 - Hey, I heard they made
an episode they never aired,\\
303 - where Jeannie
gets totally naked.\\
304 - The government banned it.\\
305 - All I know is,
with one little nose twitch,\\
306 - Samantha's clothes could be off!\\
307 - And that's hot.\\
308 - What if you
didn't have to choose?\\
309 - What if you could be with both
at the same time?\\
310 - Is that legal?\\
311 - Hey, man,
if you don't get caught,\\
312 - everything's legal.\\
313 - Stolen pretzel?\\
314 - Guys, this conversation is over.\\
315 - Yesterday,
Samantha went back in time.\\
316 - That trumps
anything Jeannie ever did.\\
317 - Oh, yeah? Well,
Jeannie can freeze time.\\
318 - So, Samantha would go back, and
Jeannie could just freeze her there.\\
319 - Who kicked whose ass then?\\
320 - You know what would decide
this whole thing?\\
321 - A little Samantha-on-Jeannie
mud wrestling.\\
322 - I'd pay a dollar to see that.\\
323 - All I know is,
Samantha helps Darrin at work,\\
324 - but what does Jeannie do
for Major Nelson?\\
325 - Turns his boss into a monkey.\\
326 - This is not helpful.\\
327 - I gotta call Major Nelson's
sexuality into question here.\\
328 - I mean, any guy who's got
a half-naked genie,\\
329 - he's got her doing
more than his laundry.\\
330 - Hey, you know
what would be best?\\
331 - Samantha's hair,
Jeannie's pretty bottle room\\
332 - and Wonder Woman's accessories.\\
333 - Hey, guys,\\
334 - we've been talking about
this for a really, really long time.\\
335 - I got it. I got the quote.\\
336 - "What a long, strange trip it's
been in Forman's basement."\\
337 - Yeah.\\
338 - We have made a lot of memories
in that basement.\\
339 - Too bad we can't
remember any of them.\\
340 - All right, you guys.
I think it's ready.\\
341 - I'm off to pop.\\
342 - Wait a minute.
I hate that quote.\\
343 - My name isn't anywhere
in that quote.\\
344 - Okay, fine. You know,
I'll just make my quote,\\
345 - "What a long,
strange trip it's been\\
346 - "with Jackie Burkhart."\\
347 - Yeah, okay,\\
348 - but without the "long,
strange trip" part.\\
349 - - All right. So I'll just write...
- "I love Jackie Burkhart."\\
350 - Okay.\\
351 - Okay, you guys, I did it.
Looks better, right?\\
352 - - Nice. Yeah.
- Totally does. Great.\\
353 - Great. All right.
Picture time.\\
354 - Yeah, I'll meet you guys in
there. I gotta change my blouse.\\
355 - Everybody out.\\
356 - - Oops, sorry!
- Kelso!\\
357 - Kelso, we just
talked about this today!\\
358 - Well, damn, Donna, if you'd
just let me see them, I'd stop.\\
359 - Fine.\\
360 - They're beautiful.\\
361 - Hanging out\\
362 - Down the street\\
363 - The same old thing\\
364 - We did last week\\
365 - Not a thing to do\\
366 - But talk to you\\
367 - Hello, Wisconsin!
\subsection {Episode 21: Prank Day}
1 - Hey, Kelso.\\
2 - Well, that's a mighty big smile.\\
3 - What, did you get
into the Play-Doh?\\
4 - No. I'm happy
'cause today is Gift Day.\\
5 - And in honor of this
special day, I got you all gifts.\\
6 - All right.
Aerosmith Live!\\
7 - Yeah, for my friend who rocks.\\
8 - Oh, man.
The new Rolling Stone.\\
9 - For my friend who reads.\\
10 - Oreos.\\
11 - For my friend who snacks.\\
12 - A triple-decker burn!
Awesome!\\
13 - What. There's peanut butter
on my headphones!\\
14 - These cookies are
filled with toothpaste!\\
15 - All right. That noise did
not come out of my butt.\\
16 - Welcome to Prank Day.\\
17 - That's right.
It's Prank Day.\\
18 - Gift Day. You idiots.\\
19 - A whoopee cushion?
What are you, two?\\
20 - These things are great.\\
21 - Hanging out\\
22 - Down the street\\
23 - The same old thing\\
24 - We did last week\\
25 - Not a thing to do\\
26 - But talk to you\\
27 - We're all all right\\
28 - We're all all right\\
29 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
30 - You got something
in your ear, man.\\
31 - What?\\
32 - Oh, my goodness.
It's peanut butter!\\
33 - Peanut butter wet willy.
Very clever.\\
34 - But the thing about it is,
you don't have to be clever.\\
35 - Okay. Okay.
This Prank Day is over.\\
36 - Let's just watch TV.\\
37 - Hey, Fez, I think
there's a Nancy Drew on.\\
38 - She can solve
my mystery any day.\\
39 - And by the way,
the mystery is in my pants.\\
40 - Okay. That's it.
I got a peanut in my ear.\\
41 - Yeah. I used chunky, so it
might get up in your brain.\\
42 - Yeah. Laugh it up now, man,\\
43 - 'cause fun time is over.\\
44 - What the hell? I'm stuck.\\
45 - I have been glued!\\
46 - Not glued, Super-Glued.\\
47 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\
48 - So you covered
the freezer handle\\
49 - and the TV knob in Super Glue?\\
50 - Knowing Forman's love for
Popsicles and Fez's love for knobs!\\
51 - Yeah. I'm an evil mastermind.\\
52 - Kelso, is there a cushion
glued to my butt?\\
53 - No. Not glued, Super-Glued.\\
54 - You're a dead man.
Yeah?\\
55 - What are you gonna do? Sit
on me with your cushion-butt?\\
56 - It won't hurt,
'cause it's a cushion-butt.\\
57 - Oh, my goodness.\\
58 - Okay.\\
59 - If you could be the princess in any
country, what country would it be?\\
60 - I pick Monaco.\\
61 - See, I always wanted to
wear my crown with a bikini.\\
62 - Donna, you're not listening
to me! This is my life here.\\
63 - Oh. Sorry. It's just...\\
64 - You know, today would've been
my parents' anniversary.\\
65 - But my mom's gone, my dad's
with Joanne, and Casey's out of town.\\
66 - So it just kind of sucks.\\
67 - You know what you need?
A little Jackie magic.\\
68 - I am gonna dedicate
my whole day to you.\\
69 - Oh, like you did last month,\\
70 - when I had to hold your
corn dog and guard the van\\
71 - while you and Kelso
did it at the 4-H fair?\\
72 - Yeah. Wasn't that fun?\\
73 - Man, I can't wait to see
this big bucket of oatmeal\\
74 - landing on Kelso's
big bucket of a head.\\
75 - Well, good gracious,
who's all this oatmeal for?\\
76 - It's for the oatmeal drive.\\
77 - For the Needy
Oatmeal Lovers of America.\\
78 - Right, the NOLOA.\\
79 - This tastes awful.\\
80 - You know,
just because they're hoboes\\
81 - doesn't mean they don't
respond to herbs and spices.\\
82 - You know what? It's a good
point, Mom, but you better leave,\\
83 - 'cause we don't like to do our
charity work in front of other people.\\
84 - Well, now, don't be silly. I'll help
you. Where'd I put my brown sugar?\\
85 - Oh, I'm right here, honey buns.\\
86 - Okay. I'm here for
our slumber party.\\
87 - Wow.\\
88 - When you said you were gonna
dedicate your whole day to me,\\
89 - I figured that meant
only until we left The Hub.\\
90 - No. I promised you 24 hours
of Jackie time,\\
91 - which is equal to seven days
of an ugly person's time.\\
92 - Well, it's just, I'm in the
middle of this really good book.\\
93 - Donna, books are for prisoners.\\
94 - Now, I brought
tons of activities.\\
95 - First, some makeup\\
96 - for your long-overdue
facial overhaul.\\
97 - The greatest board game ever,\\
98 - Mystery Date.\\
99 - And, wait.
Best of all,\\
100 - my stuffed animals
so we can perform\\
101 - an all-unicorn
rendition of Grease.\\
102 - This is perfect.\\
103 - We are so gonna nail Kelso.\\
104 - I still say we should
have shaved his privates.\\
105 - That's a burn that
keeps on burning.\\
106 - Kelso's on his way.\\
107 - Okay, gentlemen.
Take your positions.\\
108 - Okay. I'm here.
Where's the dead bird?\\
109 - Kelso, you're supposed to
come in through the side door.\\
110 - What?\\
111 - Eric, I need you
to take out the...\\
112 - You guys are so dead.\\
113 - What the hell is this?\\
114 - Eric did it
because he hates you.\\
115 - Hyde!\\
116 - Forman, every man for himself.\\
117 - No, Dad, this was just a prank
that's gone wrong.\\
118 - Horribly, horribly wrong.\\
119 - Well, I have a prank, too.\\
120 - One where my foot doesn't
plow through your ass!\\
121 - Let's hope it doesn't go
horribly, horribly wrong!\\
122 - Oh, Red.\\
123 - What happened to you?\\
124 - That oatmeal was for the hoboes.\\
125 - Well, the idiots
used it for a prank.\\
126 - Eric, how many times have I
told you, don't poke the bear.\\
127 - Don't poke the bear!\\
128 - Well, technically,
we didn't poke the bear.\\
129 - We poured oatmeal on the bear.\\
130 - Are you correcting my wife?\\
131 - Kelso's laughing at you.\\
132 - Are you laughing?\\
133 - Oh, come on.
You're covered in oatmeal!\\
134 - It's funny!\\
135 - That's it!\\
136 - You know what you should
do, Red? Forgive and forget.\\
137 - Turn the other cheek, like
Jesus. Be like Jesus, Red.\\
138 - I can't even think of a
punishment big enough for this!\\
139 - But trust me,
it's going to be awful!\\
140 - The kind of thing\\
141 - that Harry Truman
might order to end a war!\\
142 - Guys, who's Harry Truman?\\
143 - He invented electricity,
dumb ass.\\
144 - Okay, Donna. It's makeover
time. Let's pack those jumbo pores.\\
145 - You know what? I've thought
about it, and I'm glad my mom left.\\
146 - More food for me.\\
147 - Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.\\
148 - I doubt it.\\
149 - Unless...\\
150 - You were right, Donna.\\
151 - Now, not only are we
beautifying, but we're groovifying.\\
152 - Hey, I just made up a word.\\
153 - Yeah. Whoever said you can't
do two great things at once?\\
154 - I bet it was a one-armed,
pessimistic guy.\\
155 - Yeah, you just gotta
stay positive, man.\\
156 - Like, I don't want
to learn French,\\
157 - so everyday I think positive
thoughts about not learning French.\\
158 - And look at me. I don't
know a word of French.\\
159 - Is Dad still gonna kill me?\\
160 - Eric, I put him in his Corvette,\\
161 - tuned the radio to a hockey
game, and handed him a beer.\\
162 - I've done all I can.\\
163 - Dad...
All right.\\
164 - Just tell me.\\
165 - What the hell did you
think you were doing?\\
166 - Look, Kelso invented
this stupid Prank Day thing,\\
167 - and he Super-Glued us,\\
168 - so the oatmeal thing was
just to, you know, get him back.\\
169 - And that's when my life
as I know it ended.\\
170 - Are you telling me,
I got covered with oatmeal\\
171 - because you were trying
to get back at Kelso?\\
172 - Which you didn't even do?\\
173 - Well, that's a bit of
an oversimplification.\\
174 - I think if you
look at the facts...\\
175 - You...\\
176 - The facts are,
you were bested by a Kelso.\\
177 - How could you do this
to your family?\\
178 - I didn't realize the honor
of our family was at stake.\\
179 - It always is.\\
180 - Hell, we've been talking
about this since T-ball,\\
181 - which you quit.\\
182 - I mean, what was there to be
scared of? The ball just sits there.\\
183 - All right.
Here's what I'm gonna do.\\
184 - Instead of punishing you,\\
185 - I'm gonna show you how to
do this prank business right.\\
186 - Now, get the Three Stooges
over to dinner tonight.\\
187 - You are gonna help me
get them good and scared.\\
188 - Oh, well, no, Dad. I don't
wanna get Hyde and Fez.\\
189 - They're on my team.\\
190 - Well, your team lost.\\
191 - So everybody cries.\\
192 - Well, hope you boys
like lasagna.\\
193 - Oh, boy, lasagna,
the Italian burrito.\\
194 - Thanks for having us over,
Mrs. Forman.\\
195 - Oh, don't thank me.
It was Red's idea.\\
196 - Wait a minute.
Red's coming?\\
197 - Yeah. I can't believe
you guys showed up.\\
198 - Wait. No. The only
reason we showed up\\
199 - was 'cause you said
Red was working late tonight.\\
200 - Oh, God, you know what? He's in
the kitchen. Should I just get him?\\
201 - No, you should not get him,
you son of a bitch.\\
202 - I'm going out the window.\\
203 - Guys, calm down.\\
204 - Look, what could he
possibly do to us at dinner?\\
205 - Ah, good. All the
half-wits are here.\\
206 - I wanted to let you know...\\
207 - that I'm going to get you,\\
208 - and you won't know where,
and you won't know when.\\
209 - But...\\
210 - It will hurt.\\
211 - And you will cry,\\
212 - and I will laugh.\\
213 - And did I mention it will hurt?\\
214 - Very good.\\
215 - Now, enjoy the lasagna.\\
216 - I added the special
seasoning myself.\\
217 - Special seasoning?\\
218 - Uh-oh.\\
219 - All right. Maybe it's
because I'm extra clever,\\
220 - but I think that there might be
something wrong with the lasagna,\\
221 - and I think maybe Red
had something to do with it.\\
222 - Kelso,\\
223 - I wouldn't do
anything to the lasagna,\\
224 - just like I wouldn't do
anything to your new sneakers\\
225 - that are sitting
by the kitchen door.\\
226 - My Chucks!\\
227 - Why isn't anybody eating?\\
228 - Is there something wrong
with my lasagna?\\
229 - We have reason to believe
it's been tampered with.\\
230 - Is this another prank?\\
231 - Because I will not
have this in my house.\\
232 - Now, eat that lasagna.
It's perfectly fine.\\
233 - I said eat it!\\
234 - Dad, what is this
special seasoning?\\
235 - Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.\\
236 - Which reminds me.\\
237 - Kitty, I cleaned out the dead
moths from the porch light.\\
238 - If I could only remember
where I put them.\\
239 - Bugs? Sick!
I'm out of here.\\
240 - Okay, Leo.
Who's your mystery date?\\
241 - All right.
The ski instructor.\\
242 - He's hunky.\\
243 - You know, Jackie,
I never thought I'd say this,\\
244 - but I'm actually
having a good time.\\
245 - Wait. Michael,
what are you doing here?\\
246 - Yeah, man.
This is girls' night.\\
247 - Jackie, I just had
dinner with Red,\\
248 - and he totally freaked me out.\\
249 - So, first I need you to stick
your hand in my Chucks.\\
250 - And then I need you
to hang out with me,\\
251 - because I'm really
afraid to be alone.\\
252 - No. No, Michael. I am
spending time with Donna.\\
253 - Okay, but I was gonna
take you to the mall\\
254 - and tell everyone you were
a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.\\
255 - Wait, wait. You never
wanna do that. Okay. Let's go.\\
256 - I guess it's just
you and me, Leo.\\
257 - A whole pan of lasagna wasted,
and it's a recession.\\
258 - Kitty, you don't understand.\\
259 - I understand that you need
to start acting like a parent.\\
260 - But we have different
responsibilities as parents.\\
261 - Your job is to tell him that
he's cute and to clean his ears.\\
262 - My job is to make him
a man, which he's not.\\
263 - Dad, I'm right here.\\
264 - Shut up, boy.\\
265 - You see how he shuts up?
That's not right.\\
266 - I give up.\\
267 - Wow, she seems mad.\\
268 - She'll burn it off
on her Exercycle.\\
269 - We really did freak out
those guys tonight, huh?\\
270 - Now, it's time
to go after Kelso.\\
271 - The head dummy.\\
272 - And we're gonna have the
junior dummies help us out.\\
273 - You know what?
We make a good team.\\
274 - It's like I'm Batman, and
you're... No. You're Batman.\\
275 - Hey, Donna?
Wait. Where's Leo?\\
276 - Oh, he left.\\
277 - He asked if he could try on my
dad's clothes, and I said no, so he left.\\
278 - What? He left?\\
279 - That jerk.\\
280 - What a bad friend.\\
281 - Jackie, you left, too.\\
282 - I know, I know.
Look, that's why I'm here.\\
283 - I was at the mall signing autographs
for a bunch of sixth graders.\\
284 - You know, "Go, Cowboys.
Love, Jackie."\\
285 - And then I saw this
little girl crying\\
286 - 'cause she couldn't
find her mom,\\
287 - and she reminded me
of you, so I felt bad.\\
288 - Jackie, that's so sweet.\\
289 - So what happened with the
little girl? She find her mom?\\
290 - You know? I don't know.\\
291 - I left her with the snow cone
guy. Yeah. She smelled like poo.\\
292 - Look, anyways, my point is,\\
293 - you know, since you don't
have your mom around anymore,\\
294 - you need a girl in your life
to look after you.\\
295 - And that's gonna be me.\\
296 - Unless I smell like poo.\\
297 - Right.\\
298 - So when Kelso gets here,
he'll walk by the driveway,\\
299 - which we've iced down
with the hose.\\
300 - And he'll see a nudie
magazine lying there,\\
301 - which is perfect for Kelso,
because he can never resist a boob.\\
302 - Well, who among us can?\\
303 - Right.\\
304 - So, he'll sprint towards it,\\
305 - slip on the ice, and slide
into a giant pile of mud.\\
306 - Get ready.
I hear footsteps.\\
307 - What are we looking at?\\
308 - Kelso?\\
309 - Wait, wait. If you're here,
then who's in the driveway?\\
310 - Oh, crap!\\
311 - Well, the driveway
was all icy, and I fell.\\
312 - I think I heard a pop.\\
313 - Mrs. Forman,
we are so sorry.\\
314 - Mom, are you okay?\\
315 - Okay. Fez, grab her legs.\\
316 - Get away from her!\\
317 - Eric, you're grounded
for a week.\\
318 - But this prank was your idea!\\
319 - Fine. Two weeks!\\
320 - And the rest of you, get the
hell outta here. Go on, now.\\
321 - Well, this was another prank?\\
322 - See what happens
when you act like a jackass?\\
323 - Kitty, I am so sorry.\\
324 - And I promise,
no more pranks, ever.\\
325 - Okay.\\
326 - So, we're done here.
Wait!\\
327 - You're not hurt.
You were faking it.\\
328 - Oh, don't sound so surprised.
I fake things plenty.\\
329 - Wait. So you're
not hurt at all?\\
330 - Nope.\\
331 - Wow. You out-pranked Dad.\\
332 - No, no, no. It wasn't a prank.
It was a lesson.\\
333 - And yes, I did.\\
334 - So, you're the best Forman.\\
335 - You're Batman.\\
336 - Now you know.
\subsection {Episode 22: Eric's Corvette Caper}
1 - Hey, guess who's dropping Jackie
off here after cheerleading practice?\\
2 - Leslie Cannon.\\
3 - Leslie Cannon.
Nickname, "The Cannon."\\
4 - Why? Because she always
shoots Eric down.\\
5 - Man, you were
so in love with her.\\
6 - Remember in the seventh grade
when she asked you your name,\\
7 - and you got all panicky
and said, "Uh-bluh."\\
8 - Yeah, and then she called you
"Uh-bluh" for, like, the next two years.\\
9 - Yeah, that was awesome.\\
10 - I still don't see why we
have to spend the night.\\
11 - It only took me 30 minutes\\
12 - to get caught up with everyone
at my high school reunion.\\
13 - Oh, well, standing in the corner
muttering "dumb ass" at everyone\\
14 - doesn't count as
getting caught up.\\
15 - I can't wait to see some
dear old girlfriends.\\
16 - Like the Miller twins.
God, I hope they're fat.\\
17 - Oh, crap.\\
18 - There's no way that all these
bags are gonna fit in here.\\
19 - Oh, jeez,
I was really looking forward\\
20 - to taking this baby
out on the highway.\\
21 - Well, we'll just
have to take two cars.\\
22 - No, we'll take the Toyota.\\
23 - I can bring another
dress. Shows a little more leg\\
24 - so Stuart McDaniel can see
what he missed out on.\\
25 - Hey, you guys.
Here comes Leslie.\\
26 - Hey, how's my hair?\\
27 - It's a little messy.\\
28 - Hey, it's Uh-bluh!\\
29 - Yeah, I'm going by Eric now.\\
30 - She doesn't care what your
name is, Eric. She's a cheerleader.\\
31 - Wow, this car is so hot!\\
32 - Yeah, that's kind of like
what I was thinking.\\
33 - Really? 'Cause I was
thinking she was hot.\\
34 - Yeah.\\
35 - Hey, mama.\\
36 - So, whose car is this?\\
37 - Oh, it's my dad's...\\
38 - ...tough luck
that it's mine.\\
39 - So, what kind of engine
is in this thing?\\
40 - Oh, it's a multi-piston...\\
41 - 200.\\
42 - That's twice as
powerful as the 100.\\
43 - You know what? I think you
should take me for a drive tonight.\\
44 - Are you talking to me?
Yeah. No.\\
45 - Sure. Yeah. No. Shut up.
Yes, it's my car. Sure.\\
46 - Pick me up at 7:00.\\
47 - Okay.\\
48 - Oh, my God.
What have I done?\\
49 - Well, you're using
your dad's dream car\\
50 - to get with a totally hot chick\\
51 - who would otherwise
never date you.\\
52 - Well, when you put it like
that, it just sounds right.\\
53 - Hanging out\\
54 - Down the street\\
55 - The same old thing\\
56 - We did last week\\
57 - Not a thing to do\\
58 - But talk to you\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - We're all all right\\
61 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
62 - Here's the keys to
the Corvette. But...\\
63 - The only reason
I'm giving them to you\\
64 - is so you can move it
in case there's a fire.\\
65 - And because you trust me.\\
66 - Right.\\
67 - Now, you know that I'll know
if the Corvette's been moved.\\
68 - I've noted its exact
position in the garage,\\
69 - the angle of the wheels,\\
70 - and I just might have set
a few booby traps.\\
71 - I am so lucky to have a daddy
who cares enough to set booby traps.\\
72 - Fine. Okay, I get it.
The only way I get\\
73 - to drive the Corvette
is if there's a fire.\\
74 - But to the end of
the driveway. No further.\\
75 - A fire is no excuse
for a joyride.\\
76 - Michael, what are you doing
in Casey's room?\\
77 - Spitting in his socks.
What are you doing?\\
78 - We came by to say hi to Casey.\\
79 - Watching you spit
is just a super bonus.\\
80 - Yeah? Well,
your lover's out of town.\\
81 - And I asked your lover
where he was going,\\
82 - and your lover said, "Neptune,"\\
83 - and that he'd be back tomorrow.\\
84 - And then your lover punched
me in the head and laughed.\\
85 - But we'll see who's laughing
when he puts on his socks\\
86 - and gets his feet all spitty.\\
87 - Hah!\\
88 - Casey's out of town?
He never tells me anything.\\
89 - It's like the only thing I know
about him is that he's Kelso's brother.\\
90 - Well, you know he subscribes
to Van Aficionado.\\
91 - Stop snooping, Jackie.\\
92 - But, Donna, you know,
say this pile of stuff\\
93 - was to get accidentally
knocked over.\\
94 - Oh, no!\\
95 - And while picking it up, you
just happen to look through it.\\
96 - Jackie, I'm not gonna snoop.\\
97 - Oh, look! He took a quiz.\\
98 - "Your ideal chick,
van fan or biker liker?"\\
99 - But you know what? You wouldn't
care what kind of girl he likes.\\
100 - I mean, you're only dating him.\\
101 - Oh, no!\\
102 - Forman, I can't believe you're
actually gonna take out Red's Corvette.\\
103 - Yeah, and I can't believe you're
wearing brown shoes with a black belt.\\
104 - That's just tacky.\\
105 - Guys, the odometer's busted.\\
106 - The odometer's busted!\\
107 - That's a sign from God.\\
108 - God loves me.\\
109 - He wants me to steal the car.\\
110 - Besides, I think I've learned
most of Red's tricks now,\\
111 - like this one...\\
112 - The old strand of hair
across the ignition trap.\\
113 - Yeah, you're a regular
Green Beret, Forman.\\
114 - Oh, please. With that outfit, a
green beret is the last thing he needs.\\
115 - Well, here we are...\\
116 - In my Corvette...\\
117 - Enjoying the open road...\\
118 - And the delightful,
pine-fresh scent of your hair.\\
119 - That's your cheapo
air freshener. Yuck.\\
120 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
121 - Hello.\\
122 - Can I drive?\\
123 - I don't know.\\
124 - Uh-bluh.\\
125 - Okay, now, if the Miller
twins are fat, be nice.\\
126 - But if they're still thin, I don't
want to hear any "hubba-hubbas"\\
127 - or remarks about
doubling your pleasure.\\
128 - Remember, it's my reunion.
I am the prettiest one here.\\
129 - Well, you are
the prettiest one here.\\
130 - I don't understand.
The invitation says the 29th.\\
131 - Kitty, that says the 23rd.\\
132 - I have been telling you for
months that you need glasses.\\
133 - You know, one of these days, you're
gonna wander off and fall into a hole.\\
134 - What hole?
Where are these holes?\\
135 - They're everywhere.\\
136 - You just can't see them
'cause you need glasses.\\
137 - Well, we spent three hours
in Casey's room,\\
138 - and all we found out
is that he collects mud flaps.\\
139 - Yeah, but all that snooping
gave me such a rush.\\
140 - Hey, let's go to the mall
and shoplift some lip gloss.\\
141 - No thanks, little felon.\\
142 - I feel guilty enough.\\
143 - Besides, I have to finish
my chemistry homework.\\
144 - Oh, no!\\
145 - I left my chemistry book on Casey's
desk, and he comes back tomorrow!\\
146 - So we'll just
go back and get it.\\
147 - Jackie, I already went over
there all, "Where's Casey?"\\
148 - Now if I go back all,
"Where's my book?"\\
149 - But you are all,
"Where's my book?"\\
150 - But Kelso won't believe that,
and then he'll think I'm a goob,\\
151 - and then he'll tell Casey
that I'm a goob!\\
152 - Okay.\\
153 - Okay, look. We'll wait till later
tonight, then sneak back in and get it.\\
154 - Besides, Casey's got this really
great clock radio I really want.\\
155 - Kitty, don't tell Eric
that we're coming home.\\
156 - If he's doing something wrong,
and we both know he is,\\
157 - it's important that I catch him.\\
158 - Why?\\
159 - Because it gives me pleasure.\\
160 - There's the three.\\
161 - Shut it!\\
162 - I'm Red, dumb ass.\\
163 - Where are my muffins, dumb ass?\\
164 - Forman residence.
Dr. Hook speaking.\\
165 - Who is it, dumb ass?\\
166 - Steven, honey,
it's Mrs. Forman.\\
167 - Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman.\\
168 - Mrs. Forman?\\
169 - There's been some sort
of little mistake.\\
170 - I finished my homework. Now
let's move on to Bible study!\\
171 - It seems like my
reunion was last week.\\
172 - Oh, that's too bad. You were really looking
forward to seeing them fat twins, right?\\
173 - So, we're coming home tonight.\\
174 - Tell Eric, okay?\\
175 - It's important.\\
176 - Yeah, of course.\\
177 - Okay. Bye, sweetie.\\
178 - They're coming home early.
You know what this means?\\
179 - Yeah, we have to
hurry up and find Eric.\\
180 - No. We have to hurry up and
finish the rest of Red's beer.\\
181 - Hopefully, Forman will
get blamed for that, too.\\
182 - Boy, this is fun, but I
think race time is over now!\\
183 - Good, we're slowing down.\\
184 - That's good.\\
185 - A little motion
sickness going on.\\
186 - But the car's all
in one piece, so...\\
187 - I'm on top of the world.\\
188 - Wow!\\
189 - What was that?\\
190 - That was me...\\
191 - Falling off
the top of the world.\\
192 - Well, the good news is, I found
the hubcap in a huge field of mud.\\
193 - And the other good news is,
in about a hundred years,\\
194 - some archeologist is gonna
be thrilled to find my shoes.\\
195 - Sorry.\\
196 - Yeah, well, you know...\\
197 - Look, there aren't
any scratches or dents.\\
198 - So, just dirt.
I think I'm in the clear.\\
199 - Eric, I'm starting to
think I might like you.\\
200 - Really?\\
201 - I'm not sure though.\\
202 - I think I have to
drive the car some more.\\
203 - Well, I'm starting to think
I might let you drive the car.\\
204 - Really?\\
205 - I'm not sure though.\\
206 - I think we might have
to make out some more.\\
207 - Okay, I got it.
Okay, let's go.\\
208 - Jackie?\\
209 - Donna?\\
210 - Am I dreaming?\\
211 - Yes.\\
212 - Yes, you are.\\
213 - Are we gonna do it?\\
214 - Yes. Yes, Michael, we are.\\
215 - Cool.\\
216 - Donna first.\\
217 - So you smooched The Cannon.\\
218 - How was her tongue?\\
219 - Was it nimble?\\
220 - Like a belly dancer.\\
221 - And at one point,
I was touching a spot\\
222 - not four inches from boob.\\
223 - Not bad, Forman.\\
224 - Not only did you get within
shouting distance of second base,\\
225 - you successfully
snaked Red's Corvette.\\
226 - Yeah, well, I gotta wash it,
wax it and put on a hubcap,\\
227 - but that should only
take about an hour.\\
228 - I'm gonna do it in the morning.\\
229 - Perfect. Sleep tight.\\
230 - All right.\\
231 - Oh, by the way, your parents
called a couple hours ago,\\
232 - they'll be home in 40 minutes.\\
233 - What? Relax, man. We're
just messing with you.\\
234 - They'll be home in 20 minutes.\\
235 - Okay, tire location, check.\\
236 - Seat placement, check.\\
237 - Picture of Fez's butt, check.\\
238 - That one's going on my desk.\\
239 - Okay, you guys,
there's just one more thing,\\
240 - the strand of hair
over the ignition.\\
241 - Well, you're gonna get away
with it. What a bunch of crap.\\
242 - Okay, you guys, they're here.\\
243 - Damn it!
The air freshener.\\
244 - Damn it, you remembered.\\
245 - Well, there's the Corvette,
safe and sound.\\
246 - I'm just saying that for your
benefit, in case you can't see it.\\
247 - Well, I am so glad you raced all the
way home without stopping for this.\\
248 - Cripes, I gotta pee
like a banshee.\\
249 - Well, I'm off to the candy shop.\\
250 - My everlasting gobstopper
just crapped out on me.\\
251 - Fez,\\
252 - I'm sleeping in Casey's room,\\
253 - and I think somehow
I had one of his dreams,\\
254 - 'cause I did it with...\\
255 - Hey, guys.\\
256 - No, no, Michael.
Finish your sentence.\\
257 - You did it with...\\
258 - A hat on?\\
259 - And you.\\
260 - You, me and a hat.\\
261 - It was hot.\\
262 - Of course it was.
Everything's better with a hat.\\
263 - Come on, fellows. Put a
hat on. The lady deserves it.\\
264 - What were you doing
in Casey's bed anyway?\\
265 - Oh, when he's out of town,
I like to skank it up\\
266 - by skipping a couple showers
and sleeping in it naked.\\
267 - Michael, tell me
more about this dream.\\
268 - Was anyone else there?\\
269 - Jackie, why would I have a sexy
dream with anyone besides you?\\
270 - Hey, Donna.\\
271 - Hey, your old man wants
to talk to you outside.\\
272 - Why? Am I busted?\\
273 - Don't worry, man.
It's not about the car.\\
274 - Oh, Forman, I almost forgot.
It's about the car.\\
275 - You gotta stop doing that, man!\\
276 - You wanted to see me?\\
277 - Did you take my
car out last night?\\
278 - No.\\
279 - I know you didn't.
Guess how I know!\\
280 - I stuck a hair
across the ignition.\\
281 - A hair...\\
282 - You know, someday I'm
gonna use that on my son.\\
283 - Anyway, since I know I can
trust you, I'm gonna let you drive it.\\
284 - I finally get to drive it?\\
285 - Wow!\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - Where does the key go?\\
288 - Start her up.
Okay.\\
289 - And I'm grounded.\\
290 - For a month!\\
291 - Why did you do it?\\
292 - To impress this cheerleader.\\
293 - No kidding?\\
294 - Well, then make it two weeks.\\
295 - So, you gonna see her again?\\
296 - Well,\\
297 - can I have the car again?\\
298 - Oh, she's that girl.\\
299 - I know that girl.\\
300 - Stay away from that girl.\\
301 - Hey, Forman, your
mom wants to talk to you.\\
302 - She wants to know why
you drank all of Red's beer.\\
303 - You know what?\\
304 - Let's just call it a month.\\
305 - Michael.\\
306 - Jackie?\\
307 - Am I dreaming?\\
308 - Yes, you are.\\
309 - Are we gonna do it?\\
310 - Yes, we are.\\
311 - Oh, cool.\\
312 - Where's Donna?\\
313 - What?
\subsection {Episode 23: Hyde's Birthday}
1 - Any good mail?\\
2 - Well, we got the new
Yarn Barn catalog,\\
3 - and the model is
showing cleavage?\\
4 - You know,
if I want that in my house,\\
5 - I will watch McMillan and Wife.\\
6 - Oh, Steven got a letter from
Department of Motor Vehicles.\\
7 - What? Another damn ticket?\\
8 - Hey, screw head,\\
9 - why is the DMV
sending you letters?\\
10 - "Screw head."
Hey, screw head.\\
11 - No, no, no. You're screw head.
I'm just called "boy."\\
12 - I got a letter from the DMV?\\
13 - Oh, my God.
It's about the cow.\\
14 - Did I say "cow"?\\
15 - Because what I meant
was countdown.\\
16 - Countdown to better driving.\\
17 - I think what Eric's trying
to say is, he hit a cow.\\
18 - Well, I had the right of way.\\
19 - Go ahead.\\
20 - Open it, hot rod.\\
21 - You know, you are
the most irresponsible,\\
22 - careless, no-account...\\
23 - Oh, it's a license renewal
for my 18th birthday.\\
24 - Oh.\\
25 - Happy birthday.\\
26 - Guess who gets 18 hugs the
day before his 18th birthday?\\
27 - One, two, everyone.\\
28 - Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight... Okay, okay.\\
29 - All right, all right.
Thanks, Mrs. Forman,\\
30 - but you can drop it.\\
31 - I'm not really into birthdays,
especially this one.\\
32 - Oh, no, you don't.
Nine, ten...\\
33 - Get off me, spaz!\\
34 - Oh, Steven likes birthdays.
He just doesn't know it.\\
35 - Which is why we're throwing
him a surprise party.\\
36 - Now, I need two helpers
with keen\\
37 - feminine sensibilities
to help decorate.\\
38 - Jackie and Fez.\\
39 - Yay!\\
40 - What the hell!
I'm feminine.\\
41 - I should kick her ass for that.\\
42 - Hey, Jackie,
while you're up there,\\
43 - try not to kiss any more guys.\\
44 - Man, are you guys
still fighting about that?\\
45 - You got to come down hard
on stuff like this.\\
46 - If she'd have come down
harder on me\\
47 - when I was cheating,
I would've...\\
48 - Well, I would've been
way sneakier about it.\\
49 - You know what, you guys,
18 is a big deal.\\
50 - We ought to get Hyde,
like, the perfect Hyde gift.\\
51 - So, you know what,
let's try to put ourselves\\
52 - in a total Hyde state of mind.\\
53 - Yeah.\\
54 - Okay, now, what would Hyde want?\\
55 - Something stolen.\\
56 - Stolen's good,
but you know what's better?\\
57 - Stolen and dirty.\\
58 - So what's a good gift for Hyde
that's stolen and dirty?\\
59 - Someone else's pig.\\
60 - No, no, wait. I got it,
I got it. A street sign.\\
61 - We'll steal it,
so it'll be stolen,\\
62 - and it's dirty,
so it'll be dirty.\\
63 - Oh, my God! Kelso just
solved his first word problem.\\
64 - Yeah, I learned those
in Miss Carter's class,\\
65 - 'cause I knew if I got one
right that she'd give me a hug.\\
66 - No bra and they
were always pointy.\\
67 - Now, that's good teaching.\\
68 - No problem. You can
have Hyde's party here.\\
69 - There's only one thing
I ask. Can I come?\\
70 - The party's at your house,
Bob. Of course you're invited.\\
71 - Oh, boy, I'm in.\\
72 - I'll get my Anne Murray albums.\\
73 - Okay, now, you two, I
want this party to look nice.\\
74 - So, balloons, streamers,
whatever makes Steven forget\\
75 - he has no parents.\\
76 - So, Fez, you know, how do
you want to decorate this place?\\
77 - Well, what I'm thinking...\\
78 - No, no, no,
I want Arabian Nights.\\
79 - Veils, Persian rugs.\\
80 - One question, Jackie.\\
81 - Is this a party for Hyde or a
bunch of whores in a whorehouse?\\
82 - Check it out. "High Street."
Oh, man, Hyde's gonna love this.\\
83 - Here, Donna, I'll give
you a boost. Okay.\\
84 - Okay, one, two, three.\\
85 - Oh, yeah! Fingers!\\
86 - Okay, come on, Eric,
I'll give you a boost.\\
87 - No way.\\
88 - Why not?\\
89 - Because you'll throw me.\\
90 - What? No, I won't.
Yeah, I will.\\
91 - Look, how about we stand
on top of the van and reach it?\\
92 - I think not.
We'll dent the roof.\\
93 - I don't want nothing to
happen to the "love bus."\\
94 - Okay, I got it.
I got a better idea.\\
95 - Okay,
just make sure it's tight.\\
96 - Right.\\
97 - Okay, you're good to go.\\
98 - Well, at least the roof's okay.\\
99 - Steven!\\
100 - I thought you were at work.\\
101 - Not till later.\\
102 - Why are you baking
so many cupcakes?\\
103 - I had four dozen eggs.
They were gonna go bad.\\
104 - Mrs. Forman,
I don't want a party.\\
105 - And I'm not saying that
because I'm fishing for a party.\\
106 - I mean, I don't want a party.\\
107 - Uh-huh.\\
108 - Because, I know
how this family works.\\
109 - You guys say you don't want
stuff that you actually want.\\
110 - Like on Mother's Day.\\
111 - You said you didn't want a
fuss but you did want a fuss.\\
112 - So we made a fuss
and you were happy.\\
113 - That can drive a guy nuts.\\
114 - It really can.\\
115 - So now, I don't know what to do\\
116 - or say or not say,\\
117 - because I really
don't want a party.\\
118 - Well, I don't want to do
anything you don't want.\\
119 - See, I don't know
what that means.\\
120 - Well, it means
there is no party.\\
121 - Oh, please. Would I lie to you
about making you a party?\\
122 - I am hurt.\\
123 - Fine. Okay.\\
124 - I'm sorry.\\
125 - You lied.
No, no.\\
126 - I said, "Would I lie?"\\
127 - It was very tricky. I was
like Houdini, but with words.\\
128 - The base of the sign
is all cracked.\\
129 - So, all we have to do is
shove this firecracker in there\\
130 - and blammo!
The sign comes down.\\
131 - Wow, it could actually work, if
the base were made of pudding!\\
132 - If the base were
made of pudding, Eric,\\
133 - we could just pull
the sign right out.\\
134 - Okay, get ready to run.\\
135 - Must be a dud.
Go find out.\\
136 - Why me?\\
137 - 'Cause you're super skinny.\\
138 - If it blows up, you got the best
chance of having stuff not hit you.\\
139 - True, but on the other hand,\\
140 - no one would be surprised
if you blew yourself up.\\
141 - That's a good point.\\
142 - Oh, just move.\\
143 - Here, you big babies.\\
144 - Okay, what you just did,
just there, that was so hot.\\
145 - I'd follow your fine behind
into combat any day.\\
146 - All right, look,
if we got Red's tools,\\
147 - I bet I could
cut down that pole.\\
148 - Casey showed me how to saw
through rebar. Our second date.\\
149 - Wow, I love those stories.\\
150 - Hey, I'll just
sneak into your garage,\\
151 - grab the tools.
Red will never know.\\
152 - Okay, but you
gotta be really quiet.\\
153 - Come on, it's me we're
talking about. I'm like a cat.\\
154 - Red! Hey.\\
155 - You're wondering why
I'm going through your stuff?\\
156 - Okay. That's... See,\\
157 - I needed to borrow your saw,\\
158 - because I need to
chop down a tree.\\
159 - Because there's
something stuck in it.\\
160 - An animal, a rabbit.\\
161 - There's a rabbit stuck in a tree\\
162 - and I want to return
that rabbit to the wild,\\
163 - so it can lay its eggs.\\
164 - Kelso, rabbits don't...\\
165 - How the hell did
a rabbit get up a tree?\\
166 - Uh...\\
167 - Eric threw it up there.\\
168 - Eric threw a rabbit up a tree?\\
169 - Yeah. Hey,
he's a sadistic bastard.\\
170 - You know he hit a cow?\\
171 - You know, you've been in
a bad mood all night, man.\\
172 - I'm gonna cheer you up.\\
173 - Boo!\\
174 - Boo!\\
175 - You don't know what's funny.\\
176 - Oh, hey, I can work tomorrow
night if you want me to.\\
177 - You're not working tomorrow,
man. It's your birthday.\\
178 - Yeah, man, my 18th birthday.\\
179 - Otherwise known as
the beginning of the end.\\
180 - The black hole, man.
It's the death march.\\
181 - Look, if there's a war,
I could get drafted.\\
182 - If there's a war,
I'll see you in Canada.\\
183 - That's not the point, Leo. I mean,
there's other stuff, too, you know.\\
184 - Hey, don't get
snippy with me, man.\\
185 - Hyde, we need you to
settle an argument.\\
186 - I'm sure you know by now
that we're throwing you a party.\\
187 - What party?\\
188 - Okay, I'm sure you know by now\\
189 - that we're throwing you a party.\\
190 - So, what kind of
theme would you like?\\
191 - Throw whatever party you
want, man. I'm not gonna be there.\\
192 - Well, if that's his attitude, I
don't wanna do anything. I quit.\\
193 - You can't quit on me.
I quit on you,\\
194 - you bossy little midget.\\
195 - Don't even.\\
196 - What the hell?\\
197 - No! No!\\
198 - Excuse me,
little boy with glasses,\\
199 - that's our sign.\\
200 - Excuse me, big dork
with Farrah hair, no, it isn't.\\
201 - "Farrah hair"?\\
202 - If I look like any of the Charlie's
Angels, it's Jaclyn Smith.\\
203 - Wow, that's true.\\
204 - Hey there, little fella,\\
205 - what if I told you that I had
$20 for a special someone\\
206 - if they gave us the sign?
Nope.\\
207 - A month's supply of candy?
Nope.\\
208 - What if I show you my bra strap?\\
209 - Okay.\\
210 - Okay.
Okay.\\
211 - Here.\\
212 - I bet if I showed him
my whole bra,\\
213 - he would have given me his bike.\\
214 - These things are awesome.\\
215 - That was hot.\\
216 - Man, why is she so hot today?\\
217 - 'Cause you can't have her, 'cause
you lost her, 'cause you're stupid.\\
218 - Wait, Jackie cheated on you,
right, with a little, tiny cheese guy?\\
219 - Hey! Truce, okay?\\
220 - Yeah, I think that's best. Yeah.\\
221 - Hey, if you hadn't
blown it with Donna,\\
222 - you'd probably be
doing it with her right now.\\
223 - Yeah. You know who's probably
doing it? Jackie with the cheese guy.\\
224 - We had a truce!\\
225 - Wow.\\
226 - Yeah, this place looks great.\\
227 - Fez, Jackie,
the decorations are beautiful.\\
228 - No, no, no, no. They
haven't been here all day.\\
229 - I did this because
I'm feminine, too.\\
230 - I'm a lady. Why can't
anyone freaking see that?\\
231 - Oh, honey, no, it's perfect.\\
232 - Okay, the next time
I need a feminine touch,\\
233 - I'm using you and Fez.\\
234 - What happened to those cupcakes?\\
235 - Bob, there were
a dozen cupcakes there.\\
236 - I'm sorry, Red,
they're like vitamins to me.\\
237 - Hey, you guys, bad news.
Hyde said he's not coming.\\
238 - He's just sitting
in the basement.\\
239 - Oh, but it's his birthday. He
can't be alone on his birthday.\\
240 - Red.\\
241 - I agree.\\
242 - Eric, you go home
and sit with Steven.\\
243 - Okay, fine, I'll go get him.\\
244 - Surprise!\\
245 - We got him, dudes.\\
246 - All right, get your butt up those
stairs and over to your party.\\
247 - I'm not going.\\
248 - Steven, you're 18 now.
It's time to start being a man.\\
249 - And the first rule
to being a man is\\
250 - you gotta spend your life
doing crap you don't wanna do.\\
251 - Like right now, I don't wanna
be here talking to you, but I am.\\
252 - You don't wanna go
to a party, but you will.\\
253 - Actually, I won't.\\
254 - What's the matter?\\
255 - You don't like parties?\\
256 - Me neither, but as long as
you're living under my roof,\\
257 - you'll do what I tell you to do.\\
258 - Well, lucky for me, I won't be
under your roof much longer anyway.\\
259 - What the hell are
you talking about?\\
260 - Well, I'm 18. I should be
getting out of here, right?\\
261 - I mean, you know,
that's what my dad did\\
262 - and my uncle did
and my cousins did.\\
263 - They were all on their own
when they were my age.\\
264 - What are they doing now?\\
265 - Pumping gas, prison,
prison, dead, prison.\\
266 - And the reason
you're living here\\
267 - is so you don't
end up like them.\\
268 - But if you want to leave,
I can't stop you.\\
269 - So, what's it gonna be, Steven?\\
270 - Prison, death
or a birthday party?\\
271 - I guess I'll go to the party.\\
272 - Thanks, Red.\\
273 - You're welcome.\\
274 - And don't tell Eric that we
had this little conversation.\\
275 - 'Cause when he's 18, he's out.\\
276 - So, punch.\\
277 - Yep.\\
278 - Oh, fine.\\
279 - Okay, everybody,
they're here. They're...\\
280 - Surprise!\\
281 - Wow, you got me, dudes.\\
282 - Wow, thanks.\\
283 - Oh, happy birthday.\\
284 - Damn, Jackie,
stop kissing other guys!\\
285 - Wow, this is great. Did you
get this at the flea market?\\
286 - The flea market?\\
287 - Yeah, they sell them there
for two bucks.\\
288 - No, we stole it.
It took forever.\\
289 - I had to show my bra.\\
290 - You owe me a bumper.\\
291 - Now, I made this
for you. See?\\
292 - It says "Steven" on the front\\
293 - because I heard that having
your name on your clothes is cool.\\
294 - Plus, if anybody finds it,
they can return it to you.\\
295 - So, I won't be able
to lose it. Great!\\
296 - Put it on.\\
297 - Do I have to?\\
298 - You bet your ass.\\
299 - Welcome to manhood.\\
300 - Mrs. Forman, I'm not really
a pinata kind of guy.\\
301 - Oh, come on, Steven.
Everyone plays pinata.\\
302 - Yeah, Steven, hit the jackass.\\
303 - Hey! Just listen...

36 - La la la la la\\
37 - La la la la la\\
38 - Sing\\
39 - Sing a song\\
40 - Make it simple\\
41 - To last
your whole life long\\
42 - Don't worry that it's
not good enough\\
43 - For anyone else to hear\\
44 - Just sing\\
45 - Sing a song\\
46 - This is my favorite part.\\
47 - So what do you think?\\
48 - I think whatever you're on,
I'll take two of 'em.\\
49 - Hangin' out\\
50 - Down the street\\
51 - The same old thing\\
52 - We did last week\\
53 - Not a thing to do\\
54 - But talk to you\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
58 - Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do\\
59 - Perfecto.\\
60 - Well, Fez, was that you?\\
61 - I could've sworn I just heard
Wayne Newton.\\
62 - Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
you came to my concert.\\
63 - Well, it's the Spring Sing.\\
64 - There is no place we'd rather be
than the Spring Sing.\\
65 - Now, Kitty, that's just a lie.\\
66 - Ai, here comes my music teacher
Mr. Wilkinson.\\
67 - He is unpleasant.\\
68 - Are you the parents of this
horrible little man?\\
69 - I'll have you know he's been
imitating my accent behind my back.\\
70 - Well, first of all,
we are not his parents.\\
71 - And second of all,\\
72 - well, the rest of it
I just don't care about.\\
73 - I'm moving you to the back row\\
74 - so that no one can hear that
squawk box that you call a voice.\\
75 - The back row?\\
76 - But the back row is for
the untalented and the ugly!\\
77 - Oh, you're no fun.\\
78 - Music is not about fun.\\
79 - It's about passion
and commitment.\\
80 - Have you ever been moved to tears by
the warbling timber of your own voice?\\
81 - No, because I am a man.\\
82 - Ohh!\\
83 - Well, he just, um...\\
84 - He doesn't seem to like you
at all.\\
85 - The British have always
hated my people.\\
86 - We won the war, buddy!
Get over it!\\
87 - Oh, good one, Fez.\\
88 - Well, you certainly seem
in high spirits.\\
89 - Of course. Soon all my friends
are gonna be here,\\
90 - and we'll be all like a family.\\
91 - I wish you were my family.\\
92 - Oh, we would be
so happy together.\\
93 - Okay, kids,
it's nighty-night time!\\
94 - Good night, Mom.\\
95 - Night, Ma!\\
96 - That's my mama!\\
97 - I love you, Fez.\\
98 - I love you more!\\
99 - I love you the most!\\
100 - Daddy!\\
101 - All right, sleep tight,\\
102 - and don't let the bedbugs
put their foot in your ass.\\
103 - Okay, boys, lights out.\\
104 - And no more staying up till 8:30
giving each other hugs.\\
105 - - Aww!
- Aww!\\
106 - See you in the morning.\\
107 - Imagine me and you\\
108 - I do\\
109 - I think about you
day and night\\
110 - It's only right\\
111 - To think about
the one you love\\
112 - And hold him tight\\
113 - So happy together\\
114 - All: We're happy together\\
115 - Are you people singing again?!\\
116 - - Yes.
- Good, 'cause...\\
117 - I can't see me
lovin' nobody but you\\
118 - For all my life\\
119 - Both: When you're with me\\
120 - Baby, the skies'll be blue\\
121 - For all my life\\
122 - Me and you, and you and me\\
123 - No matter
how they toss the dice\\
124 - It has to be\\
125 - The only one for me is you\\
126 - And you for me\\
127 - All: So happy together\\
128 - I can't see me
lovin' nobody but you\\
129 - For all my life\\
130 - When you're with me, baby,
the skies'll be blue\\
131 - For all my life\\
132 - So happy together\\
133 - So how is the weather?\\
134 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
135 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
136 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
137 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
138 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
139 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
140 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
141 - Ba-ba ba ba\\
142 - Well, that was... detailed.\\
143 - You are one fruity kid.\\
144 - Now, remember,\\
145 - singing is all about
the use of the diaphragm.\\
146 - And what's so funny\\
147 - about the proper use
of the diaphragm?\\
148 - It's the muscle
you breathe with...\\
149 - Below your bosom.\\
150 - Oh, bloody imbeciles.\\
151 - So this must be a very
exciting night for you.\\
152 - If the mayor likes what he sees,\\
153 - I'll be directing this year's
Dairy Days Dance-a-bration.\\
154 - Oh, that is always wonderful.\\
155 - One time they had a quartet
dressed as cows,\\
156 - and they sang "Blue Moon".\\
157 - Ha ha ha!\\
158 - 'Cause they were cows!\\
159 - Yes, I'm sure you
thick-headed Americans\\
160 - could hardly contain
your grunts.\\
161 - Well, I thought it was
delightful.\\
162 - Hey, everybody!\\
163 - Bob!\\
164 - Hey, I saved seats
for you and the gang.\\
165 - I don't think they're coming.\\
166 - Of course they are.\\
167 - Well, you know,
I asked if they needed a ride,\\
168 - but they said no.\\
169 - When I left, they were just
sitting in the basement laughing.\\
170 - But the show's about to start.\\
171 - Ooh, then I better get
to the refreshment table.\\
172 - Did you know that
all that stuff was free?\\
173 - Well, it says "donations accepted,"
but you don't gotta put nothing in.\\
174 - My friends are still
in the basement?\\
175 - I wonder what they're doing?\\
176 - - Oh, I'm sure they're just...
- Miss Kitty, please.\\
177 - I'm trying to wonder.\\
178 - Ooh, guys, Fez's concert
is about to start.\\
179 - Which means we have three more
hours without his sorry ass!\\
180 - Let's eat his candy.\\
181 - Yeah.\\
182 - My name is Fez.
I love candy.\\
183 - Whore. Good day.
I said, good day!\\
184 - Yeah, and the best part is that
idiot actually thinks I'm his friend.\\
185 - Like I care.
I wish he were dead.\\
186 - Oh, hey, we should kill him.\\
187 - No, I got a better idea.\\
188 - Let's sing without him.\\
189 - Some people call me
the space cowboy\\
190 - Yeah, some call me
the gangster of love\\
191 - Mm-hmm\\
192 - Some people call me Maurice\\
193 - 'Cause I speak of
the pompatus of love\\
194 - 'Cause I'm a picker\\
195 - I'm a grinner\\
196 - I'm a lover\\
197 - And I'm a sinner\\
198 - I get my lovin' on the run\\
199 - I'm a joker\\
200 - I'm a smoker\\
201 - I'm a midnight toker\\
202 - All: Playing my music
in the sun\\
203 - Whoo\\
204 - All: Whoo\\
205 - So they would rather
make fun of me than come here.\\
206 - Well, honey, you know,
at least they're singing.\\
207 - Like you'll be doing real soon.\\
208 - Happy song, happy song\\
209 - You know, last night they went
to a party without me...\\
210 - A topless party!\\
211 - - What?!
- Where?!\\
212 - They were the first people to be
nice to me when I came to America,\\
213 - but maybe I'm not their friend.\\
214 - Maybe I'm just
a goofy foreign kid.\\
215 - Well, can't you be both?\\
216 - I would settle for "friend," but
I don't even think I am that.\\
217 - You still got "goofy foreign
kid." That's something.\\
218 - Well, the butts
are in the seats,\\
219 - but not one butt
is the butt of a friend.\\
220 - Well, this is just rude.\\
221 - They better have run out of gas
or hit a deer or something.\\
222 - Okay, places, everyone.\\
223 - Let's show them what we've got...
Teeth and cleavage!\\
224 - Teeth and cleavage!\\
225 - Well, that does it!
Now I am mad!\\
226 - All they care about is themselves and
their stupid, messed-up relationships.\\
227 - Boo hoo!
Love hurts!\\
228 - Well,
they deserve it.\\
229 - Aw, jeez, not another one.\\
230 - Oh! Do we really have to see
that foreign boy sing?\\
231 - I'm not going.\\
232 - I'm in too much pain
from our break-up.\\
233 - Even though it was months ago,
it still affects every part of my life.\\
234 - Me, me, me.\\
235 - No! Me, me, me.\\
236 - What about me, me, me?!\\
237 - - Me.
- Me.\\
238 - - Me.
- All: me!\\
239 - Love hurts\\
240 - Love scars\\
241 - Love wounds\\
242 - Love mars\\
243 - Any heart not tough\\
244 - Or strong enough\\
245 - To take a lot of pain\\
246 - Take a lot of pain\\
247 - Love is like a cloud\\
248 - It holds a lot of rain\\
249 - Love hurts\\
250 - All: Ooh, love hurts\\
251 - All: Love hurts\\
252 - Love scars\\
253 - Love wounds\\
254 - Love mars\\
255 - Hurts, scars
Wounds, mars\\
256 - I know it isn't true\\
257 - I know it isn't true\\
258 - Love is just a lie\\
259 - Made to make you blue\\
260 - All: Love hurts\\
261 - Oooh\\
262 - Love hurts\\
263 - Ooh\\
264 - Wow, I just caught the end,
but that was nice!\\
265 - Leo, you made it!\\
266 - No, I got this at a church sale.\\
267 - Hey, where's that dude
and that other dude?\\
268 - And that girl?\\
269 - And that dude?\\
270 - And the other girl?\\
271 - They're not here.\\
272 - It's just me alone.\\
273 - Always alone.\\
274 - Imagine me\\
275 - And you\\
276 - I do\\
277 - So happy...\\
278 - Together\\
279 - Aw, forget it.
I'm going home.\\
280 - Hey, Fez.\\
281 - Where the hell have you been?!\\
282 - Well, we were on our way here when
we passed by your music teacher's house.\\
283 - And I said, "Fez hates that guy!\\
284 - Let's toilet paper it."\\
285 - - So...
- So we did.\\
286 - - For me?
- And then we had to go
get some dog poop,\\
287 - 'cause we looked at
his porch and realized,\\
288 - "Hey, not enough dog poop."\\
289 - There is enough dog poop now.\\
290 - And we got you
an opening night present.\\
291 - Congratulations, buddy.\\
292 - Ha ha ha!\\
293 - Bloody hell!\\
294 - Is that my mailbox?\\
295 - Bloody 'ell.\\
296 - Is that me mailbox?
Ha ha ha!\\
297 - It's dead on!\\
298 - Yes, I'm sure you'll all
remember this fondly\\
299 - as you rot in your Barca loungers, cheeseburgers
clenched in your fat American fists.\\
300 - You got that right, buddy.\\
301 - Aw, look who has
so many friends!\\
302 - Don't ever leave him alone
with us again.\\
303 - I'm so glad you came.\\
304 - Tonight wouldn't mean anything
without you guys.\\
305 - Oh, Fez, we wouldn't miss it.
I mean...\\
306 - There's nothing more
that I'd like to do\\
307 - Than take the stage
and dance with you\\
308 - Keep dancin'\\
309 - Let's keep dancin'\\
310 - Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing\\
311 - Yeah, yeah, whoo\\

Havin' us a ball\\

and I'm Barbra Streisand.\\
348 - Love me!\\
349 - I'm so happy to be back home
with my friends.\\
350 - Some people call me
the space cowboy\\
351 - No. Nobody calls you that.\\
352 - If anyone's a "space cowboy,"
it's me.\\
353 - What? In your dreams, Forman.\\
354 - I'm widely acknowledged as the
"space cowboy" of this group.\\
355 - And I also call
"midnight toker."\\
356 - Wow!\\
357 - This cheeseburger
is bloody brilliant.\\
358 - Love mars\\
359 - Hurts\\
360 - Aah!\\

368 - Shake it, shake it\\
369 - Whoo!
\subsection {Episode 25: Eric's False Alarm}
1 - Okay, boys, I brought
cheese samples from work.\\
2 - What's wrong with them?\\
3 - Nothing.
Well, they were in the trash.\\
4 - - Bring it over.
- Cool.\\
5 - Hey.\\
6 - You know how my brother locks me in a
closet with a pillowcase full of dead fish\\
7 - until the stink makes me cry?\\
8 - Well, while I was in there,
I heard him make a phone call.\\
9 - And it seems that's he got a
little surprise for Donna tonight.\\
10 - The honeymoon suite at
that French motel in Kenosha.\\
11 - The Le Motel?\\
12 - Oh, no, it sounds like Donna
and Casey are going to le do it.\\
13 - Yeah. Eric's gonna freak out
when we tell him.\\
14 - - And why would we tell him?
- To watch him freak out.\\
15 - Kelso, he's gonna
take it really hard, man.\\
16 - So we just need to
keep our mouths shut.\\
17 - Wow. It's very considerate
of Eric's feelings.\\
18 - What the hell, man!\\
19 - I just think that we all need
to zip it. Especially you.\\
20 - Hey, I can keep a secret.\\
21 - I didn't tell Kelso you took
five bucks from his wallet.\\
22 - Hyde!\\
23 - None of you guys
can keep a secret.\\
24 - Well, you sure can, especially
when it's about you kissing other guys.\\
25 - Michael,
it was one guy from work.\\
26 - And I told you I'm sorry.\\
27 - God, how long are you gonna
keep throwing that in my face?\\
28 - Well, how long are you gonna keep
throwing your face in other guys' faces?\\
29 - Wow, that was clever.\\
30 - I think I won that. Yeah!\\
31 - Oh, Eric.\\
32 - Let me
just say I'm sorry.\\
33 - - For what?
- I can't tell you.\\
34 - Hey, but if you were
to guess that\\
35 - Casey is taking Donna to a
honeymoon suite, I'd say good guess.\\
36 - Wait.\\
37 - Casey and Donna
got a motel room?\\
38 - Yeah, but, hey
, look at the bright side.\\
39 - Donna and Casey may be
doing it, but at least they're doing it\\
40 - in a vibrating,
heart-shaped bed.\\
41 - If you see what I mean.\\
42 - Well, I do now, thanks to your
spot-on detailed description.\\
43 - And there will
probably be a mirror, too.\\
44 - Okay, thanks, Fez.\\
45 - - You know,
so they can watch it...
- Yeah, I know.\\
46 - I'd like to propose a toast.\\
47 - My divorce papers
finally came through.\\
48 - - To divorce.
- Oh, no, no. No, no.\\
49 - If you're gonna drink to
divorce, drink alone in the dark\\
50 - like regular sad people.\\
51 - I'm not sad, I'm happy.\\
52 - 'Cause now I can do all kinds
of things I couldn't do before.\\
53 - Like, Joanne
, we could get married.\\
54 - Is something funny?\\
55 - Bob, we've never
mentioned marriage before.\\
56 - You spring it on me now
in front of strangers?\\
57 - Excuse me, my mistake, I guess.\\
58 - I guess I hurt
someone's feelings.\\
59 - Well, you certainly did.
We are not strangers.\\
60 - So what are you and
Casey doing tonight?\\
61 - He won't tell me.
It's a surprise.\\
62 - Honey,
it's blush not spray paint.\\
63 - A surprise, huh?\\
64 - What if the surprise is something
big? Are you ready for it?\\
65 - I mean, how do you really feel
about Casey?\\
66 - I don't know.\\
67 - Well, how do you
feel about his hair?\\
68 - Love it, lots of body.\\
69 - - And his body?
- Love it, lots of hair.\\
70 - How about his car?\\
71 - I love it. Trans Ams kick ass.\\
72 - So hair, body and car. The
big three. The holy trinity of love.\\
73 - Okay, I think you're ready
for your big surprise.\\
74 - Jackie,
what is this big surprise?\\
75 - All I can tell
you is definitely,\\
76 - definitely shave those legs.\\
77 - Well, I called the Le Motel.\\
78 - Fez, you were right. Casey
has a reservation for tonight.\\
79 - And, Hyde, you were right.
I cannot keep a secret.\\
80 - Speaking of secrets, look
what I found in Jackie's cheese.\\
81 - Some guy Phil's phone number.\\
82 - I can't take this anymore.
I just know it, Hyde.\\
83 - She's cheating on me again.\\
84 - Kelso,
don't jump to conclusions.\\
85 - Maybe I don't care.\\
86 - Forman, man, you gotta be cool
about this Donna thing,\\
87 - or she's gonna
know you're jealous.\\
88 - You can't be all
Simon and Garfunkel.\\
89 - You gotta get
Bruce Springsteeny.\\
90 - Springsteeniant.
Springsteenicious.\\
91 - Wait, what are we talking about?\\
92 - Whoa. Hey,
you guys, I'm not jealous.\\
93 - I'm just looking out for her.\\
94 - I mean, Donna's
practically a sister to me.\\
95 - A tall, shapely sister.\\
96 - Who I've done it with.\\
97 - About a million times.\\
98 - Look, maybe Donna and Casey
won't even do it tonight.\\
99 - I'd call it 50-50.\\
100 - You would?\\
101 - Oh, I'd be wrong.\\
102 - But I'd call it that to keep you
from doing something stupid.\\
103 - Forman, you gotta
do something stupid.\\
104 - Sitting around
feeling helpless all day.\\
105 - That isn't healthy. That's
why I'm gonna stalk Jackie.\\
106 - You know, I really
love things with holes.\\
107 - Swiss cheese,
donuts, inner tubes.\\
108 - I don't know what it is about
a hole, it just feels good.\\
109 - Hello?\\
110 - Is Phil there?\\
111 - Who?\\
112 - Phil. Some guy you kissed!\\
113 - I found his
number in your cheese.\\
114 - Michael, Phil is the guy
who delivers the sausage.\\
115 - You tramp!\\
116 - No, idiot,
he brings food to our store.\\
117 - He's our sausage guy.\\
118 - Tramp!\\
119 - Who's that singing? Who's
singing love songs to you?\\
120 - Peter Frampton!\\
121 - Are you kissing him?\\
122 - No!\\
123 - Are you sure?\\
124 - Hello.\\
125 - Hello, this is Norman.
Shall we kiss?\\
126 - Okay, Red. What Bob needs
right now is a good friend.\\
127 - And since I don't know
where we're gonna find one,\\
128 - you need to talk to him.\\
129 - - Kitty!
- Or you can talk to Joanne.\\
130 - I'll take Bob.\\
131 - I'll take Joanne.\\
132 - Donna, I have to talk to you.\\
133 - Leo, what...
Have you got Donna in there?\\
134 - You know, I didn't think to ask.\\
135 - Look, I have to find Donna.\\
136 - Casey's gonna surprise her
with the honeymoon suite.\\
137 - And I know Donna. She's not
gonna like that kind of surprise.\\
138 - So she'll probably
be looking for an out, so...\\
139 - I'm here to rescue her.\\
140 - Kind of like Luke did
with Leia in Star Wars.\\
141 - You know,
"I'm here to rescue you!"\\
142 - The other honeymoon suite's
across the hall, man.\\
143 - Now if you excuse me, I got a
game of Twister I gotta stretch for.\\
144 - Casey, check it out.
They have tiny soaps.\\
145 - What am I doing?\\
146 - I couldn't do it, Leo.\\
147 - Donna's having a good time.
She doesn't wanna be rescued.\\
148 - But you know what?
The thing is,\\
149 - I still wanna go in there
and stop everything, you know?\\
150 - I didn't come here for her,
I came here for me.\\
151 - That's a huge dilemma, man.\\
152 - But you know what you really
gotta ask yourself?\\
153 - Is there anybody\\
154 - who's not in a motel room
with three women\\
155 - that you could tell this to?\\
156 - Okay, here's the thing.\\
157 - Bob really likes you.\\
158 - Why?\\
159 - Who knows?\\
160 - That's America.\\
161 - Any kook can have
any damn fool idea he wants.\\
162 - Look, I haven't had good luck
with marriage.\\
163 - When my first husband and
I were dating, he was great.\\
164 - But as soon as I married him,
he turned into,\\
165 - well, something like you.\\
166 - Well, I don't know what kind of
crap your ex-husband used to pull.\\
167 - But whatever it was,
Bob doesn't have it in him.\\
168 - He's just a nice, loyal guy\\
169 - with a big heart.\\
170 - He's perfect for
a pushy gal like you.\\
171 - Well, he does have a big heart.\\
172 - And we do go well together.\\
173 - You know, Red, if I didn't know any
better, I'd think you were a good guy.\\
174 - Well, if I didn't know any
better, I'd think I cared.\\
175 - The red cheese is chewy.\\
176 - The red cheese is wax.\\
177 - Oh.\\
178 - Hey, guess what, fellas?\\
179 - Turns out I still have
feelings for Donna. Yeah.\\
180 - Deep feelings.\\
181 - Warm feelings.\\
182 - Tingly-in-the-pants feelings.\\
183 - And I can't do
anything about it because\\
184 - she has those
feelings for someone else.\\
185 - I think that admitting
that you still love Donna\\
186 - is an important step.\\
187 - Because it reopens
the door for this.\\
188 - Eric
loves Donna! Eric loves Donna!\\
189 - Look, you guys.
I don't love her.\\
190 - I just think that if she's not with
me, the fairest thing for everyone is if\\
191 - she's alone and unhappy.\\
192 - Dude, that is a bad plan, man.\\
193 - 'Cause if you
leave a chick alone,\\
194 - the next thing you know, she's
licking the roof of another guy's mouth.\\
195 - Like the cheese guy.\\
196 - I hate that guy.\\
197 - But you love his cheese.\\
198 - See, this is just
like a Southern tragedy.\\
199 - Tennessee Williams,
but with cheese.\\
200 - I'm taking Advanced English.\\
201 - Oh, man, I got to go to the
mall. I'm late to stalk Jackie.\\
202 - I just...\\
203 - I can't believe Donna's in a
motel room with him right now.\\
204 - Man, I don't like it either.\\
205 - But there is one
thing you can do.\\
206 - I believe you have a stack of
Playboys underneath your bed?\\
207 - Go use them.\\
208 - Okay, Bob,
I think the problem is that\\
209 - Joanne thinks you're moving
just a little too fast.\\
210 - It's just who I am.
I do everything fast.\\
211 - I run fast,\\
212 - drive fast,\\
213 - I eat fast.\\
214 - Okay, what happens
when you eat fast?\\
215 - I get gassy.\\
216 - Right.\\
217 - Okay, well, a relationship
works the same way.\\
218 - When it grows too fast,
it gets gassy, too.\\
219 - And... And... And then the bad thing
happens and people leave the room.\\
220 - Wow.\\
221 - A lot of people have
told me to slow down,\\
222 - but nobody ever said it
in a way that spoke to me.\\
223 - - Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Joanne.\\
224 - Oh, okay, well, we'll just...
We'll leave you two alone.\\
225 - Okay, well, there will be no
more marriage talk from Bob.\\
226 - What?\\
227 - There had better be.
She's expecting it.\\
228 - Oh, crap!\\
229 - - Lock the doors.
- I'm on it.\\
230 - Michael!\\
231 - What are you doing?\\
232 - What?
Are you spying on me now?\\
233 - No.\\
234 - Okay, fine,
yeah, I'm spying on you.\\
235 - 'Cause you're around
strange guys all day\\
236 - and apparently, every once in a
while, you up and French one of them.\\
237 - Michael, go home.\\
238 - This is a place of business, and
if you don't have any business,\\
239 - you're not welcome at the mall.\\
240 - Fine.\\
241 - Stay away from my girlfriend!\\
242 - Michael, what are you doing?\\
243 - Well, I can be at the mall now,
'cause I got business, train business.\\
244 - You have lost your mind!\\
245 - Yep, and I don't miss it!\\
246 - Michael, look at you,\\
247 - riding around on a kiddie
train so you can spy on me.\\
248 - I mean, do you not
see how crazy this is?\\
249 - Yeah.\\
250 - But I don't know what to do.\\
251 - I mean, I'm a mess.
I can't sleep, I can't eat.\\
252 - Well, I can eat. Only when
I eat, I get kind of sleepy.\\
253 - But I am really upset.\\
254 - Look, if we're ever
gonna get past this,\\
255 - you have to forget
about that stupid little kiss\\
256 - and just try, try to remember
that we love each other.\\
257 - - I know.
- So can we please,\\
258 - please just finally move on?\\
259 - I wanna say yes,\\
260 - but it's like
we're on this track,\\
261 - and we keep going around
in circles, like some kind of,\\
262 - some kind of...\\
263 - I don't know,
I lost my train of thought.\\
264 - Okay, Forman.\\
265 - What were you doing
at the Le Motel last night?\\
266 - And don't say you weren't
there because Leo saw you.\\
267 - Wait, wait, Leo thinks he
saw me at the Le Motel?\\
268 - Cut the crap, Eric.\\
269 - You know Casey and I
had a room last night,\\
270 - so you went there,\\
271 - and you pulled the fire
alarm all night until we left.\\
272 - Fire alarm?
I didn't... I didn't pull...\\
273 - Wait, you guys left?\\
274 - - So you guys didn't...
- No!\\
275 - We spent all night in the parking
lot with Leo and his hootie mamas.\\
276 - Eric, what were you even doing
at the motel?\\
277 - I don't know, I just...\\
278 - I was fine, right?\\
279 - I mean, we were friends
and that was cool.\\
280 - And now, Donna,\\
281 - all of a sudden, it's like
the day after we broke up\\
282 - all over again and...\\
283 - Look, I'm sorry.\\
284 - But when I knew you were
gonna be with Casey, I just...\\
285 - I felt...\\
286 - Whatever.\\
287 - No, I get it.\\
288 - Remember when you wanted
to date other people\\
289 - and I was so cool about it?\\
290 - Well, I wasn't.\\
291 - It, like, broke my heart.\\
292 - So what did you do?\\
293 - Well, I didn't know
what to do, so I just...\\
294 - You know?\\
295 - Right.\\
296 - Casey.\\
297 - Right.\\
298 - Hey, look, from now on, I'm
gonna stay out of your business.\\
299 - I promise.\\
300 - Thank you.\\
301 - But before that
promise goes into effect,\\
302 - I would like it duly noted for the record
that I think Casey's all wrong for you.\\
303 - And I think\\
304 - you guys are
moving way too fast.\\
305 - Duly noted.\\
306 - And I'll stay out of
your business, too.\\
307 - Okay, good.\\
308 - So I better drum me up
some business, huh?\\
309 - Still sleeping, huh?\\
310 - Gosh, pulling fire alarms all
night must really wear you out.\\
311 - That's right.
I'm onto you, buddy.\\
312 - You did a nice thing
and I'm telling everybody.\\
313 - Come on, man,
I didn't do it to be nice.\\
314 - I did it 'cause I always
wanted to commit a felony.\\
315 - Misdemeanors just ain't
the rush they used to be.\\
316 - Well, all I hear is,\\
317 - "I love you,
I love you, I love you."
\subsection {Episode 26: Everybody Loves Casey}
1 - Oh, Hyde, get this.\\
2 - Casey just came by
to pick up Donna,\\
3 - and he was out in the street just
revving his Trans Am real loud,\\
4 - and then he peels out in the
street, and he started doing donuts.\\
5 - And then,
out comes Donna, all smiling\\
6 - and, like, looking at him.\\
7 - What a slut!\\
8 - Look. If she wants to
date him, that's fine.\\
9 - But he doesn't have to be
all loud and jerky about it.\\
10 - Jerky, loud, donut jerk.\\
11 - Oh, guess what, boys.\\
12 - I entered the big wiener
contest at the Piggly Wiggly,\\
13 - and I won a year's supply
of all-beef hot dogs.\\
14 - I'm a wiener winner.\\
15 - Well, anyway,
we're having a barbecue.\\
16 - No, Kitty! I thought we
were going to talk about that.\\
17 - Oh, and I saw Donna
at the grocery store,\\
18 - and she said she's bringing
her friend Casey.\\
19 - What? No. I hate Casey.\\
20 - He's Donna's new boyfriend. You
have to uninvite him. Dad, tell her.\\
21 - Kitty, you've done
a horrible thing.\\
22 - It could scar the boy for life.\\
23 - Now, let's do the right thing
and cancel that barbecue.\\
24 - No. We're having it,
and it'll be fun.\\
25 - And we just... We won't
give Casey any relish.\\
26 - All right.\\
27 - Once Casey finds out he's not getting
any relish, he'll dump Donna for sure.\\
28 - You are so screwed.\\
29 - So your mom invited Casey over
for hot dogs?\\
30 - Well, that's a plump,
juicy all-beef burn.\\
31 - It's just typical women stuff.\\
32 - Like Jackie
kissing that... Aah!\\
33 - - Hyde!
- Yeah. Okay?\\
34 - I've decided if anyone brings up
any more of their stupid girl stuff,\\
35 - I'm gonna throw
something at them.\\
36 - This time, I threw a fist.\\
37 - I'm sorry. It's just
everything reminds me.\\
38 - Like, last night Rocky was on,\\
39 - and I was thinking I'm like
Rocky and Jackie is Apollo Creed.\\
40 - And she bashed in my face
by kissing that guy.\\
41 - At least Rocky wins in the end.\\
42 - Kelso, Rocky loses.\\
43 - Oh, yeah? Well, why is he
jumping around all happy?\\
44 - Because he goes
the distance, fool.\\
45 - He loses the fight,
but he wins in life.\\
46 - Who wants to watch a movie
with a message like that?\\
47 - Ice-cream man!\\
48 - You guys, I've been
thinking about Donna. And I...\\
49 - This time I threw a magazine.\\
50 - No, guys, seriously. This
barbecue might work out in my favor.\\
51 - You see, Donna's only seen
Casey around his smelly,\\
52 - tattooed,
Molly Hatchet-loving friends.\\
53 - But when he comes to the
barbecue, he'll be around us.\\
54 - Good, clean, Lynyrd
Skynyrd-loving Americans.\\
55 - And the comparison
will not be kind to him.\\
56 - And then Donna will
come running home to you.\\
57 - No.\\
58 - Well, maybe. You think?\\
59 - So, instead of pounding Casey
like you should,\\
60 - you came up with
this zany scheme.\\
61 - Forman, you've officially
turned into Daffy Duck.\\
62 - You're "dethpicable!"\\
63 - You know,
I have lady problems, too.\\
64 - Rhonda won't let me
get past second base.\\
65 - I even said please.\\
66 - Magic word, my ass!\\
67 - You know what?
Jack, I can't do this.\\
68 - Why should I paint
these round, berry toes\\
69 - if some other guy
is gonna end up licking them?\\
70 - Michael,
what are you talking about?\\
71 - I still can't get
over you cheating on me.\\
72 - And I need to hear
you apologize again.\\
73 - And this time, maybe you
should cry or give me money.\\
74 - No, Michael. I am not
gonna beg for forgiveness.\\
75 - I didn't make you do that
when you cheated.\\
76 - Well, that is totally different.\\
77 - When guys cheat, it's because
they need some hot action.\\
78 - But when girls cheat, it's way
worse, 'cause girls don't even like sex.\\
79 - We do, too.\\
80 - Well,
why aren't we doing it now?\\
81 - Because I don't want
to do it right now.\\
82 - I do. Point made. Thank you!\\
83 - No. You know what?
We need help.\\
84 - We should consult the world's
highest authority on relationships.\\
85 - Cosmo!\\
86 - "Why you should touch
your breasts every day."\\
87 - Wow, this could help.
They seem smart.\\
88 - Okay, Fez, when Casey gets here,\\
89 - ask him for advice about
your second-base problem.\\
90 - My advice is gonna be
way better than his,\\
91 - and Donna will see
that he's a greasy dolt.\\
92 - Hey, Forman, I have an idea.\\
93 - Set up a wacky system
of ropes and pulleys\\
94 - and when Casey gets here,
drop an anvil on his head.\\
95 - - Because that's
what Daffy does.
- Yeah, I got that.\\
96 - - Hey, guys.
- Hey.\\
97 - Hey, Foreplay. Getting a
little shaggy up there, buddy.\\
98 - Okay. Well, that's
enough of that! Okay. So...\\
99 - Hey, you guys are just in time.\\
100 - Fez was telling me about some kind
of problem you're having with Rhonda.\\
101 - Yeah. Rhonda won't let me
get past second base,\\
102 - and I really want
to explore further.\\
103 - Gosh. Well, I don't know,
I think if you're patient\\
104 - and you're respectful,\\
105 - when Rhonda's ready, she'll...\\
106 - She'll wave you over.\\
107 - Well, thank you, Eric. That
is very gentlemanly advice.\\
108 - Gentlemanly? Well,\\
109 - guilty as charged, I guess.\\
110 - Hey, Casey, what do you think?\\
111 - Well, sometimes a
seasoned lady like Rhonda,\\
112 - she's gotten used to
the usual order of things.\\
113 - So, I think the next time
you're fooling around,\\
114 - just skip second
and go right to third.\\
115 - - What?
- It's genius.\\
116 - No wonder you never get any.\\
117 - Yeah, with Rhonda, you know,
that just might work.\\
118 - Wait, you like that?\\
119 - Well, the words are wrong, but they
sound so good coming out of his mouth.\\
120 - I got a way about me.\\
121 - That worked out "thuper."\\
122 - Okay, Michael. I found
something out about our situation.\\
123 - This article says that cheating is
a symptom of a deeper problem.\\
124 - Deeper problem?\\
125 - No! I don't want a deeper
problem! I want a quick fix!\\
126 - Well, too bad.\\
127 - Because I realize that
I'm still hurt and angry\\
128 - from all the times
you cheated on me.\\
129 - Okay? And that is
why I kissed that guy.\\
130 - So what are you saying?\\
131 - I'm saying, I'm not sorry.\\
132 - I'm not sorry!\\
133 - Come on!\\
134 - Look, now I know why I cheated.\\
135 - You need to read this Cosmo
and find out why you did.\\
136 - And I ripped out the boob
pictures, so don't bother looking.\\
137 - Hey, Donna,
would you like a hot dog?\\
138 - Maybe half.\\
139 - Whoa, man, you carry a knife?\\
140 - Yeah. You never know when a
lady's gonna need a half a hot dog.\\
141 - It's funny, man.\\
142 - You're the boy scout, but
I'm the one who's prepared.\\
143 - He's like a gladiator.\\
144 - Okay, that's it. I'm bringing
out the big guns. Oh, yeah.\\
145 - I'm introducing him to my folks.\\
146 - Oh, hey, Mom, meet Casey.
This is Donna's new boyfriend.\\
147 - Well, you're certainly
not a girl.\\
148 - Nice to meet you, Mrs. Forman.\\
149 - You know, you couldn't
have picked a prettier day\\
150 - to win a year's
supply of hot dogs.\\
151 - Yeah, sure is a hot dog.\\
152 - Mom?\\
153 - Sorry, honey,
it's just, he's just...\\
154 - I am sure you are much smarter.\\
155 - Kitty, the idiot neighbors
drank all my beer.\\
156 - Uh-oh. You're in a bad mood.
Hey, meet Casey.\\
157 - Pleasure, sir.
Hey, maybe I can help.\\
158 - I always keep a spare case
of beer in the Trans Am.\\
159 - Little tip I picked up
in the Army.\\
160 - I don't know.
Seems like a pretty good kid.\\
161 - Uh-huh.\\
162 - So, you and Casey, huh?\\
163 - Look, Hyde, whatever you heard
about Casey, he's changed now.\\
164 - He's... He's mature.\\
165 - Oh, yeah. He's real mature.\\
166 - Well, I like him!\\
167 - We're together, and if you can't deal
with that, then you can just go to hell!\\
168 - Hey, that's not
barbecue language, young lady!\\
169 - Here's that beer, sir.
I got a soda for the minor.\\
170 - Now,\\
171 - you make sure to
drink that real slow,\\
172 - 'cause I don't want you to get
a tummy ache, little guy.\\
173 - Well, that's thoughtful.\\
174 - Yeah, he cramps up easy.\\
175 - Casey and Donna, man.\\
176 - Hey, remember when we were 12?
We didn't even like girls yet.\\
177 - I liked girls when I was 12.\\
178 - Yeah, I was happy just staying
home Friday night in my underwear,\\
179 - just tossing
a football to myself.\\
180 - Yeah, never did that either.\\
181 - Well,\\
182 - at least I gave it
my best shot, right?\\
183 - If Donna loves
Casey and not me, then,\\
184 - I mean, I guess it's over.\\
185 - Forman, you can't give up.\\
186 - Okay, look. Who knows what's
gonna happen with me and Jackie.\\
187 - But what you and Donna had,\\
188 - that was, like, real.\\
189 - And I'm telling you,
as his brother...\\
190 - Look, Casey is bad news.\\
191 - He's either gonna get bored and split,
or something worse is gonna happen.\\
192 - So, you gotta do something.\\
193 - Hey, since when did
you get all serious?\\
194 - Been reading Cosmo.\\
195 - It was very educational.\\
196 - Yeah. I never realized how much
plumbing girls had down there.\\
197 - Like, there's this diagram,
and it's like a map of Six Flags.\\
198 - Okay, everyone.\\
199 - Here's lunch.\\
200 - Hot dog soup!\\
201 - No more hot dogs.\\
202 - I'll just eat
the grilled cheese.\\
203 - You mean,
grilled cheese with hot dogs!\\
204 - Kitty, for God sakes,\\
205 - I ate 14 hot dogs yesterday!\\
206 - Well, what do you want me to
do, Red? They're everywhere.\\
207 - They're a curse on this house.\\
208 - Oh, fine.
Let's make some calls.\\
209 - Maybe we can unload the
damn things on a nursery school.\\
210 - You guys, I've let this thing
with Casey go way too far.\\
211 - Yeah, no kidding.
Donna's pretty far gone.\\
212 - She's starting to lash out
at people at barbecues.\\
213 - You gotta kick his ass, man.\\
214 - Hyde, Eric cannot beat Casey
with his fists.\\
215 - He's a special boy who must
beat him with his special strengths.\\
216 - Now, let's think. What is
Eric's special strengths?\\
217 - Welcome back to TV's favorite
game show...\\
218 - Now let's meet our returning
champion, Eric Forman!\\
219 - Thanks. Good to be back, Fez.\\
220 - Let's meet our challenger,
Casey Kelso!\\
221 - Casey Kelso, it's time to...\\
222 - Get into that box!\\
223 - How does he do it?\\
224 - He's so tiny.\\
225 - I would watch that show.\\
226 - Okay. That was great.\\
227 - Guys, I'm going over to Casey's.\\
228 - And I don't know what I'm gonna
do. But if things get physical,\\
229 - I'm just gonna have
to drop the hammer.\\
230 - And if all else fails, kick him
in the stones and run like hell.\\
231 - Yeah, that's what I meant
by "drop the hammer."\\
232 - Rhonda, your lively tongue
has made me thirsty.\\
233 - Would you like to
wet your whistle?\\
234 - Wow. Thirsty lady.\\
235 - Well, we're off to a nice start.\\
236 - Shall we move on to second base?\\
237 - No.\\
238 - Guess what. I read your little
"Everything's my fault" article,\\
239 - and I realize why I cheated.\\
240 - Remember the first time
I kissed Pam Macey?\\
241 - - Behind the gym?
- And in the gym,
and in her car.\\
242 - But, anyway...\\
243 - Earlier that day, I didn't have
any money to buy you Tater Tots.\\
244 - And you said that I'd never
be able to support you,\\
245 - 'cause I wasn't smart enough.\\
246 - And you're always
putting me down like that,\\
247 - and it makes me
feel bad about myself.\\
248 - And that is why I cheated.\\
249 - That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard!\\
250 - Just like that.\\
251 - And then I thought about it, and
I realize that I'm not sorry either.\\
252 - Michael, what are you saying?\\
253 - I'm saying that we're
not right for each other,\\
254 - because you make me feel bad!\\
255 - And...\\
256 - And...\\
257 - I don't think I can
be with you anymore.\\
258 - I want to break up.\\
259 - Wait, break up?\\
260 - No, no. Michael, I was wrong.
Please, let's talk about this.\\
261 - - No.
- Wait, but Michael!\\
262 - Casey, we need to talk.\\
263 - Well, I'm a little swamped
right now, Foreplay.\\
264 - I think Donna
thinks you love her,\\
265 - and if you don't,
you shouldn't act like you do.\\
266 - What are you? The love police?\\
267 - Hands up. Love police is here.\\
268 - Hey, all I'm saying is that
if you don't love her,\\
269 - just don't be with her, okay?
Because she's a really special person,\\
270 - and someone out there
could really love her.\\
271 - Someone out there
or someone right here?\\
272 - - Oh. Hey, Eric. What are you doing here?
- He was just leaving.\\
273 - Well, I gotta go, too.\\
274 - Hey, Pinciotti.\\
275 - Love ya.\\
276 - Oh, well, I...\\
277 - Thank you.\\
278 - Okay, well, I'll...
I'll see you later.\\
279 - You see, Forman,\\
280 - it's just words.\\
281 - You don't have to mean it.\\
282 - If you make her cry,\\
283 - I'm coming right back here
to kick your ass.\\
284 - Well, me and Jackie
are officially over.\\
285 - We're as done as this hot dog.\\
286 - This hot dog isn't done.\\
287 - Well, if kicking Casey's butt is the same
as babbling at him from a safe distance,\\
288 - then, boy, did I do it!\\
289 - But seriously, you guys,
the days of Daffy are over.\\
290 - It's time for action.\\
291 - I'm going Road
Runner on his ass.\\
292 - Good.\\
293 - Because thanks to his stupid
advice, Rhonda dumped me.\\
294 - I tried to steal third,
but she blocked me\\
295 - and choked me.\\
296 - Now there's no
more baseball for Fez.\\
297 - It's back to handball.\\
298 - Girls, man.
They'll make you miserable.\\
299 - Well, I got a date.\\
300 - "Tho long, thuckerth!"\\
301 - It's like Playboy,\\
302 - but girls look at it.\\
303 - I know. How hot is that?\\
304 - Oh, look. Six Flags!\\
305 - Well, that better not
be a dirty magazine.\\
306 - Oh, Cosmo. Good for you.\\
307 - Cosmo?\\
308 - You boys are spending
too much time together.
\subsection {Episode 27: Love, Wisconsin Style}
1 - So, Mr. Hammond said it
was fine for me to miss class\\
2 - 'cause I'm already getting an A.\\
3 - So, just as you suspected, Mom,\\
4 - I am better than everybody.\\
5 - All I know is my little boy was
very brave at the dentist today.\\
6 - Wasn't he?\\
7 - Yes he was,
my wittle snicklefritz.\\
8 - Okay, Mom, when a
boy reaches a certain age,\\
9 - the baby voice
no longer comforts him.\\
10 - It urges him to kill.\\
11 - Okay, let's get you some coffee.\\
12 - Nobody pukes in the Trans Am.\\
13 - Mrs. Forman.\\
14 - Uh-oh, you look mad.\\
15 - What did Eric do?
Bad Eric!\\
16 - Donna, why aren't you in school?\\
17 - No worries.
I called her in sick.\\
18 - I told them, "Lady troubles."
No questions asked.\\
19 - Oh, hey.\\
20 - Easy there, Wobbles.\\
21 - Have you been drinking?\\
22 - I hope so.\\
23 - 'Cause if not, this whole
place is a-spinnin'.\\
24 - Hang on, boys, it's a twister!\\
25 - Hanging out\\
26 - Down the street\\
27 - The same old thing\\
28 - We did last week\\
29 - Not a thing to do\\
30 - But talk to you\\
31 - We're all all right\\
32 - We're all all right\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - So, my mom and I were at
The Hub getting ice cream,\\
35 - and we caught Donna
with Casey skipping school.\\
36 - And she was drunk, in
the middle of the afternoon.\\
37 - It was like Sue Ellen on Dallas.\\
38 - You went to The Hub
for ice cream with your mommy?\\
39 - Why would you tell me that?\\
40 - Hyde, the point is, he went
for ice cream without us.\\
41 - You cannot pick up a phone?\\
42 - You know who can't pick up
a phone? Jackie.\\
43 - I broke up with her and she
never calls to even say hi,\\
44 - or offer me sad,
but hot, break-up sex.\\
45 - I mean, that's just selfish.\\
46 - Guys, my mom's over
at the Pinciottis' right now\\
47 - telling Bob about
Donna being drunk.\\
48 - Can't do that kind of stuff in
the middle of the afternoon.\\
49 - It'll mess with your...\\
50 - Thinking thing.\\
51 - You know what I'm saying.\\
52 - Yeah, you gotta stay sharp, man.\\
53 - That's why I keep
myself pure until 3:00.\\
54 - Two o'clock. That's why I
keep myself pure until 2:00.\\
55 - I'm not wearing a watch.\\
56 - Hey, you know what?\\
57 - Donna getting busted
is actually great for me,\\
58 - because now she's got to
realize what a jackass Casey is.\\
59 - And when she dumps him,\\
60 - I'll be standing right here with open
arms and a gentle "I told you so."\\
61 - Oh, yeah, that could happen.\\
62 - After all, I mean,
I made that girl a woman.\\
63 - We stole dead fish.\\
64 - Dead fish? What are you
going to do with dead fish?\\
65 - You're missing the point,
man. We stole dead fish!\\
66 - You just don't get it.\\
67 - Hey.\\
68 - Hey.\\
69 - I just came by...
I miss you.\\
70 - What?\\
71 - Did you say you missed me?\\
72 - No.\\
73 - Look, just say you miss me.\\
74 - Fine, I miss you!\\
75 - Michael, I miss you, too.\\
76 - And look, I was thinking,\\
77 - since we broke up because
I kissed another guy,\\
78 - what if I let you
kiss another girl?\\
79 - I mean, we could be even,
and we could get back together.\\
80 - If you think that
me kissing another girl\\
81 - is gonna bring
us closer together,\\
82 - I'm totally willing
to make that sacrifice.\\
83 - Thank you, Michael.\\
84 - I better go wash my face.
Okay.\\
85 - This fish is so stinky.\\
86 - What the hell are we
going to do with the stinky?\\
87 - It's simple, man. We're gonna
find a place to hide the stinky,\\
88 - and ruin someone's day.\\
89 - Now, question is
where, how and who?\\
90 - The answer is,
there, that and Kelso.\\
91 - Oh, it's like a bowl.
A bowl for the stinky.\\
92 - And we will put it, and he'll never
find it, and it will smell forever.\\
93 - What the hell's going on with you?
You're grounded! No arguments!\\
94 - Dad, I'm not grounded.\\
95 - Okay, well, then,
whatever you think is best.\\
96 - No, not whatever she thinks
is best. You are grounded.\\
97 - You're not my mother.
You have no say in what I do.\\
98 - Well, she's got you there.\\
99 - Let's see.\\
100 - Which chick do I want to kiss?\\
101 - Oh, no, no, no, Michael.
I get to pick the girl.\\
102 - But you'll pick an uggo.\\
103 - You didn't call "No uggos."\\
104 - Hey, I just thought
of something.\\
105 - Your plan's good and all,\\
106 - but what if the girl that you
pick doesn't want to kiss me?\\
107 - "Doesn't want to kiss me!"\\
108 - And then I told Donna she was
grounded, and she said, "No."\\
109 - She said, "No"?\\
110 - Can you do that?\\
111 - No.\\
112 - I need your help, Red. I gotta
get Donna away from that guy.\\
113 - Oh, Dad, you know what's good?\\
114 - Threaten her with
the old "foot in the ass."\\
115 - How can such a bad influence
live in such a handsome package?\\
116 - Bad people should have
a big scar or an eye patch\\
117 - so you can recognize them.\\
118 - The problem is,\\
119 - you know, there's a point
where your kids realize\\
120 - you can't do nothing
to control them.\\
121 - There is?\\
122 - No. Now, stop listening.\\
123 - Bob, I don't want
to get involved.\\
124 - I got enough problems with the 14
kids who think they live here now.\\
125 - Why do I have to hold the fish?\\
126 - Because that's what
the little buddy does.\\
127 - Someone's coming!\\
128 - So, the guy's trying
to tell me that his Z28\\
129 - is the same car as my Trans
Am except for the decals.\\
130 - How can people be so ignorant?\\
131 - I see you, Donna.
I see you.\\
132 - Dad!
Don't you "Dad" me!\\
133 - You're not going anywhere,
not with this guy.\\
134 - You're grounded again.\\
135 - Dad, I'm gonna do
whatever I want,\\
136 - with whoever I want,
whenever I want to do it.\\
137 - We have to have
a talk right now, Donna.\\
138 - Sir, let me just say\\
139 - that you're making
a lot of sense here,\\
140 - and I think that when I
bring Donna home tonight,\\
141 - you two ought to sit down and
really hammer this thing out.\\
142 - Okay, that sounds fair.\\
143 - What?\\
144 - You're just gonna let
her go off with him?\\
145 - What else can I do?\\
146 - Oh, good God, that's it!\\
147 - Everybody in the living room.\\
148 - Now!\\
149 - Not you.\\
150 - Bob, get in here!\\
151 - Donna, what has gotten into you?\\
152 - Skipping school, showing
no respect for your father...\\
153 - That's right.
Shut up, Bob.\\
154 - Okay, here's snacks.\\
155 - So, anybody need a drink?\\
156 - I'll take a rum
and Coke for the road.\\
157 - Hey, hey, buddy, little tip,\\
158 - I think booze is what got
you in trouble in the first place.\\
159 - How could you take this girl out\\
160 - drinking in
the middle of the day?\\
161 - Well, you know how it is. All
the older girls were at work.\\
162 - Can I just say this guy
is not boyfriend material.\\
163 - I agree. You're not going out with
him anymore. You two are done.\\
164 - No!
All right.\\
165 - What?\\
166 - You got to admit this
has been a real hassle.\\
167 - I mean, it was fun
and you're a great girl,\\
168 - but let's just call it a day.\\
169 - You're breaking up with her?\\
170 - Casey, I thought you said you...\\
171 - You know, you said you loved me.\\
172 - I have this thing where I
say stuff I don't really mean.\\
173 - Casey.
Look, Donna.\\
174 - I see what you're getting at,
and I'm not that type of guy.\\
175 - Mrs. Forman, what say we
rain check that rum and Coke?\\
176 - Donna, I'm really sorry.\\
177 - You're not sorry. You got
exactly what you wanted.\\
178 - Eric, someone here to see you.\\
179 - Hi.\\
180 - Hi.\\
181 - Okay. Can I get
anyone a snack?\\
182 - Mom.\\
183 - Right, right. Have to stop
doing that.\\
184 - So...\\
185 - How are you?\\
186 - Humiliated.\\
187 - I'm such an idiot.\\
188 - I got dumped in front
of the whole world.\\
189 - I don't even know what I
said to your mom at The Hub,\\
190 - and I hate that
she saw me like that.\\
191 - What is wrong with me?\\
192 - Hey, nothing.\\
193 - Look, your mom left. Come on,
you're allowed to freak out.\\
194 - Everybody warned me about
Casey, and I fell for him anyway.\\
195 - And he's such a jackass.\\
196 - Yeah, I...\\
197 - I really, really wanted
you to figure that out,\\
198 - just not like this.\\
199 - Eric, I'm just...\\
200 - I'm so sorry.\\
201 - Hey.\\
202 - I was so stupid.\\
203 - Eric, we should be together.\\
204 - Wait, what?\\
205 - Let's just, like, forget
all this other stuff happened.\\
206 - Wait, wait.\\
207 - Donna, I mean, if you come
running back to me now,\\
208 - I...\\
209 - Donna, I can't be
your second choice.\\
210 - But you're not.\\
211 - Eric.\\
212 - Oh. Where am I?\\
213 - How about I kiss her?\\
214 - No way.\\
215 - She's too tall,
too tanned, too rich.\\
216 - Damn, Jackie, I don't want
to kiss a short, pale, poor girl.\\
217 - Okay, look, Michael, all I know
is I don't want to stay broken up.\\
218 - Okay, you know what?
You choose.\\
219 - Kiss any girl you want.\\
220 - I choose you.\\
221 - Michael, that is the most
romantic thing I've ever read,\\
222 - heard about or seen on TV.\\
223 - Yeah, it was pretty romantic.\\
224 - I could tell
while I was doing it.\\
225 - What?
No, it's just...\\
226 - Look, one week you
break up with me,\\
227 - and the next week
you're Prince Charming?\\
228 - I'm an incredibly
complex man, Jackie.\\
229 - Michael, I can't
do this anymore.\\
230 - Look, Michael, if you want
to choose me, then choose me.\\
231 - I mean, really choose me.\\
232 - Let's get married.\\
233 - What?\\
234 - Michael, all our problems
are because we haven't decided\\
235 - we're gonna be together forever.\\
236 - So, let's decide.\\
237 - Hold on.\\
238 - You want to get married?\\
239 - Yes, Michael! Yes, I accept!\\
240 - Oh, my God!\\
241 - You know what?
I gotta go tell my dad.\\
242 - And you!
You have to buy a ring.\\
243 - Just think about it. We
are going to be the "Burkhart-Kelsos."\\
244 - The Who-hart What-o's?\\
245 - Michael and I are
getting married.\\
246 - Yeah, we heard. That's
why we're decorating the van.\\
247 - But... But not with fish.\\
248 - Let me get this straight.\\
249 - Donna wanted to get back
together, and you said no?\\
250 - I said no.\\
251 - You said no?\\
252 - Dumbass!\\
253 - Look, I have my reasons, okay?\\
254 - What could they be?
What could they possibly be?\\
255 - Casey dumps her and she comes
to me? Okay, I'm not a rebound.\\
256 - So you're too
proud to take her back?\\
257 - And what do you
have to be so proud of?\\
258 - You're not an athlete.\\
259 - The only smart thing
about you is your mouth.\\
260 - And look at you.\\
261 - Red, he looks fine.
He's just so darn stupid!\\
262 - I'm very upset.\\
263 - Well, stop, okay?\\
264 - Because I already
feel bad enough as it is.\\
265 - Well, you should.
Well, I do!\\
266 - I love her.\\
267 - God, why do I always have to
screw these things up, you know?\\
268 - Why does everything
always have to be my way?\\
269 - That's why we broke
up in the first place.\\
270 - Well, we've all
known that for a year.\\
271 - Okay.\\
272 - Okay, I have to
tell Donna how I feel.\\
273 - Then go!\\
274 - Oh, Red.\\
275 - I know.\\
276 - We're never gonna
get him out of the house.\\
277 - Donna?\\
278 - Oh, hello,
Mr. Pinciotti, Mrs...\\
279 - I'm sorry, Joanne.
I don't know your last name.\\
280 - I have something
to tell you guys.\\
281 - I love Donna.\\
282 - Well, she isn't here.
We don't know where she is.\\
283 - And it's Stupac.\\
284 - Well, if it's okay,
I'll just wait.\\
285 - Sure.\\
286 - I always liked you.\\
287 - Oh, thank you, sir.\\
288 - But do me a favor. Don't
play with her undergarments.\\
289 - Something reeks.\\
290 - Man!\\
291 - Where are you going?
Bus station.\\
292 - I'm going to my
mom's in California.\\
293 - Oh, my God.\\
294 - You're running away.\\
295 - I don't know what else to do.\\
296 - No, I know how you feel.\\
297 - Jackie wants to get married.\\
298 - To me!\\
299 - What?\\
300 - Look, a lot of people
don't know this about us,\\
301 - but Jackie's
pretty much in charge.\\
302 - So it might happen.\\
303 - But it won't happen
if I'm not here.\\
304 - You know what? I'll drive you.
We'll both go to California.\\
305 - Kelso, are you up for this?\\
306 - Hey, if the Beverly
Hillbillies can do it, so can I.\\
307 - Great, let's go.\\
308 - Oh, my God. What stinks?\\
309 - This town, baby.\\
310 - We're leaving that smell behind.\\
311 - Kelso!\\
312 - I'm not gonna tell you again.\\
313 - Well, I was reaching
for my soda. Damn!\\
314 - Man, Iowa smells like fish, too.\\
315 - I should have taken the bus.
