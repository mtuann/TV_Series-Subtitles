\subsection {Episode 01: Going to California}
1 - Hello? Donna, it's you!\\
2 - How's California?\\
3 - Have you run into
Johnny Carson yet?\\
4 - No. I read
he won't eat corn.\\
5 - What? Oh, Eric. Oh, no, no. I
know he wants to talk to you.\\
6 - He hasn't heard from
you all summer. I'll get him.\\
7 - Eric! Ow!\\
8 - Eric. Eric,
are you in the bathroom?\\
9 - Yes.\\
10 - Well, get off because...
Mom? Mom,\\
11 - when this door is closed, it's
my sacred alone time, okay?\\
12 - Think of it as church.\\
13 - But I...
Mom!\\
14 - Fine.\\
15 - Gets up at noon, sits
on the toilet till dinner.\\
16 - What kind of summer is that?\\
17 - Hanging out\\
18 - Down the street\\
19 - The same old thing\\
20 - We did last week\\
21 - Not a thing to do\\
22 - But talk to you\\
23 - We're all all right\\
24 - We're all all right\\
25 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
26 - Well,\\
27 - you made me lose
my concentration.\\
28 - Now I'm gonna have to go
back there in about an hour.\\
29 - I just wanted to
tell you Donna called.\\
30 - Her number's on the pad
by the kitchen phone.\\
31 - What?\\
32 - Why wouldn't you say something?\\
33 - And I'm staying out of it,\\
34 - but if you'd eat a little bran,\\
35 - you could've taken
that call yourself.\\
36 - Where's the notepad?\\
37 - Here.\\
38 - Quit twitching.\\
39 - What? There's no number.\\
40 - Dad.\\
41 - Step away from the vehicle.\\
42 - Isn't it a little early
for you to be hopped up?\\
43 - Empty your pockets. Now.\\
44 - Get the hell out of my pants!\\
45 - Got it.\\
46 - What the hell is wrong with him?\\
47 - He has low self-esteem
because you are too domineering.\\
48 - Red, you're gonna let Forman
get away with that, man?\\
49 - He just felt you up.\\
50 - Where's the foot in the ass?\\
51 - Unless you're getting too old.\\
52 - Shut it.\\
53 - And go shave that thing.\\
54 - You look like a damn Hungarian.\\
55 - It's ringing.\\
56 - It's ringing.\\
57 - Oh, my God, it's ringing.\\
58 - And Eric chickens out again.\\
59 - Quack, quack, quack.\\
60 - Forman, what's the problem?\\
61 - It's just...\\
62 - I want to tell her to come
home, that I miss her,\\
63 - that I love her. I mean,\\
64 - it's too much to say
over the phone.\\
65 - Look, Eric,
just write her a letter.\\
66 - That's how I broke up
with Michael.\\
67 - Yeah. I was able
to take my time\\
68 - and come up with
good synonyms for\\
69 - "Cowardly, won't-marry-me loser,\\
70 - "run-away-to-California
jackass."\\
71 - Jackie, I'm charismatic
in person.\\
72 - I've got these
awesome hand gestures.\\
73 - And I kind of, like, waggle
my eyebrows when I talk.\\
74 - Wait. You do that
on purpose?\\
75 - Thanks, you guys.
That's helpful.\\
76 - You know what?
That's it. I'm going.\\
77 - I'll just show up in California
and, like, blow her mind.\\
78 - Yeah. I mean,\\
79 - when the Empire killed Luke
Skywalker's aunt and uncle,\\
80 - did he just call them up?\\
81 - No! He hopped on
the Millennium Falcon\\
82 - and he paid a little visit
to the Death Star.\\
83 - Wait a minute.\\
84 - Do chickens go quack,
or did I mess that up?\\
85 - I sat at my mom's house for
three hours. Eric still hasn't called.\\
86 - Hey, you know what might
make you feel better?\\
87 - Playing pinball.
Over there.\\
88 - I don't have any quarters.\\
89 - Hey, Kelso. You know
what might help me?\\
90 - If you could tell me
how you got over Jackie.\\
91 - You remember Jackie, don't you?\\
92 - Who's Jackie?\\
93 - Jackie was my dog.\\
94 - She died in
a Big Wheel accident.\\
95 - No, Annette, I meant Jackie,
his ex-girlfriend.\\
96 - Also dead.\\
97 - She's not dead.\\
98 - What's going on here?\\
99 - Why are you lying to me?\\
100 - No, I'm not lying, Jackie.\\
101 - Annette! Look, baby...\\
102 - Well, my work here is done.\\
103 - You want to go to
California to get Donna?\\
104 - You can't go to California.\\
105 - But I have to tell
Donna I love her,\\
106 - and that she should
be back here with me.\\
107 - Oh, well, that's sweet.\\
108 - I think it would sound
especially good on the phone.\\
109 - But don't call till after 7:00
when the rates go down.\\
110 - Well, I can't call her.
I mean,\\
111 - did Luke Skywalker...\\
112 - Oh, would you stop?\\
113 - Luke Skywalker this,
Luke Skywalker that.\\
114 - I'm sick of hearing
about that little fruit.\\
115 - Luke Skywalker is not...\\
116 - He and Leia clearly... I...\\
117 - Mom, Dad,\\
118 - - this is important.
- No.\\
119 - No California.\\
120 - You know what's important?
School.\\
121 - You're gonna be a senior
and you need to buckle down.\\
122 - Luke Skywalker
would've buckled down.\\
123 - Forman, there's
a flight to California\\
124 - in four hours, and you're on it.\\
125 - Before you get all gushy,
we didn't pay for it.\\
126 - We stole the money
from your secret stash\\
127 - in the Scooby-Doo thermos.\\
128 - You guys know about Scooby-Doo?\\
129 - Well, it was a good try,
but you should have known\\
130 - that eventually I would need
to take some cocoa on the go.\\
131 - Well, thanks, you guys,\\
132 - but my parents will kill me.\\
133 - No, Eric, we'll cover for you.\\
134 - Yeah. Believe me, I got
no problem fooling whitey.\\
135 - Hyde, you're white.\\
136 - Barely.\\
137 - Eric, if you love her,
you have to go.\\
138 - You're right.
I'm gonna do this.\\
139 - Damn it, I'm going.
I gotta go pack.\\
140 - Hey, let me help. I love
putting together outfits.\\
141 - Finally.\\
142 - Yeah, I thought
they'd never leave.\\
143 - You know, Steven, it was really
nice of you to get that ticket for Eric.\\
144 - This usually works a whole
lot better when you don't talk.\\
145 - Look, Annette,\\
146 - you're way more important
to me than Jackie ever was.\\
147 - I mean, you're blonde,
you're beautiful,\\
148 - you practically
never wear a whole shirt.\\
149 - I'm sorry. It's just the thought
of you with somebody else\\
150 - got me really upset.\\
151 - I'm really upset.\\
152 - Which is why I propose\\
153 - that we do something
special and romantic.\\
154 - Let's do it.\\
155 - Michael, I don't do that.\\
156 - I'm a virgin.
What...\\
157 - ...a coincidence.\\
158 - Me, too.\\
159 - So let's do it.
Be first-timers, yeah.\\
160 - You know what?
I'm gonna go cool off.\\
161 - Kelso...
Uh-uh, one second.\\
162 - She's cooling off.\\
163 - Look. I was wondering if you and
Annette could maybe discuss your plans\\
164 - to do it or not do it
when I'm not around.\\
165 - But you're never not around.
You're always here.\\
166 - You're like a carbuncle.\\
167 - Kelso, you don't even know
what a carbuncle is.\\
168 - Well, I know it's gross
and it doesn't go away.\\
169 - Okay. I'm sorry.
It's just...\\
170 - I don't know anybody else.\\
171 - And California people
are freaks.\\
172 - Like that guy. You can't
smoke that out here!\\
173 - I miss Eric.\\
174 - That guy even looks like Eric.\\
175 - Oh, my God. Eric!\\
176 - Donna!\\
177 - Kelso, what the hell
are you doing?\\
178 - Winning.\\
179 - I can't believe
you came here for me.\\
180 - Of course I did.\\
181 - Donna, I love you.\\
182 - And I have so much
to say, but I...\\
183 - You guys can French
all you want. I totally won.\\
184 - Hey, Red.\\
185 - Good day, Mr. Red.\\
186 - Wait a minute.
Where's the other idiot?\\
187 - Other idiot?\\
188 - Do we know another idiot?\\
189 - Where's Eric?\\
190 - Where's Eric?\\
191 - Where are you, man,
and who wants to know?\\
192 - The U.S. government,
that's who.\\
193 - Like, I read by 1984,
the government\\
194 - will have tracking
devices on all of us.\\
195 - And after that, they're gonna
jam electrodes in our brains,\\
196 - so they can read our memories.\\
197 - Damn U.S. government.\\
198 - Damn U.S. government?\\
199 - Without our government,
you'd be stuck in Siberia now,\\
200 - sucking the juice
from a rotten commie potato.\\
201 - Let me tell you something.\\
202 - If the U.S. government\\
203 - decides to stick a
tracking device up your ass,\\
204 - you say, "Thank you\\
205 - "and God bless America."\\
206 - He's so easy.\\
207 - And then after Michael
threw up, I told him,\\
208 - "You're not supposed to eat
the plastic wrapping."\\
209 - And that's how we met.\\
210 - Wow. That's...\\
211 - That's like Love Story.\\
212 - Wow. I wish there
was more to talk about.\\
213 - Bye.\\
214 - Would you look at her?\\
215 - She's so hot,
she could be a robot.\\
216 - A robot?\\
217 - Whatever. Look.\\
218 - You have the van,
and we want to go home.\\
219 - No. Uh-uh. I can't
leave Annette. I love her.\\
220 - You don't love her.\\
221 - I love parts of her.\\
222 - I mean, unlike Jackie,
she believes in me.\\
223 - Okay, I told Annette
I wanted to be an astronaut\\
224 - and she said that
she thought I could.\\
225 - To be fair, she wants
to be a lady astronaut.\\
226 - I mean, come on, guys. Just
give me a few hours, okay?\\
227 - If... Look, this girl is beautiful,
and she believes in me.\\
228 - And if I can get her to put out,\\
229 - she'll be three out of three.\\
230 - But right now,
she's only two out of three.\\
231 - And I'm sorry, but 50%
just ain't gonna cut it.\\
232 - Okay, look, Steven, these
last few weeks with you\\
233 - have been really dirty
and really wrong.\\
234 - Jackie, talking is for people
who have something in common.\\
235 - Oh, good God.\\
236 - You kids switch partners
more than square dancers.\\
237 - No, it's not what you think.
We're not together.\\
238 - Then what's going on
in my kitchen?\\
239 - Eric's in California.\\
240 - Jackie, you just
totally burned Forman.\\
241 - That was so badass.\\
242 - So, Annette, I'm just saying
that I'm leaving in a couple hours.\\
243 - So I guess the question is,\\
244 - what, oh, what can two
virgins do to kill an afternoon?\\
245 - Well, there is something.\\
246 - But it's kind of wet and dirty.\\
247 - Sold!\\
248 - Having fun?\\
249 - No.\\
250 - I mean, these are
our last hours together\\
251 - and you're not nude!\\
252 - So all you care about is sex?\\
253 - I thought there was
more to you than that.\\
254 - But there isn't.\\
255 - But there is.
I believe in you.\\
256 - Stop saying that.\\
257 - But I do.\\
258 - Damn. All right.
Start digging the moat.\\
259 - I was so scared that I'd never
feel like this with you again.\\
260 - I mean,\\
261 - Eric, after last year...\\
262 - Donna.
...I...\\
263 - About Casey and all that stuff?\\
264 - I don't care. Okay?\\
265 - I just want to be with you.\\
266 - You know, all summer,
I hated California,\\
267 - but now that you're here,
it's, like, amazing.\\
268 - This is the most romantic
night of my whole life.\\
269 - Yeah, I know. Me, too.\\
270 - I have sand in my crack.\\
271 - Yeah, me, too.\\
272 - Oh.\\
273 - Eric, I want to go home.\\
274 - Hey, Kelso. How was
your date with Annette?\\
275 - We went to a carnival.\\
276 - I won her six stuffed animals.\\
277 - Then we shared a giant pretzel.\\
278 - And then I walked her home,
and she gave me a good-night kiss\\
279 - on the cheek.\\
280 - You know, in Wisconsin,\\
281 - if you win a girl
a giant purple rhinoceros,\\
282 - she puts out!\\
283 - So, my folks have
no idea I was gone.\\
284 - No idea.
You're golden.\\
285 - Ah.\\
286 - Oh, hey!
Hyde!\\
287 - You got a beard!\\
288 - You look so old.\\
289 - Of course I look old, man.
Party more than you,\\
290 - worked more, drank more,
and slept with way more chicks.\\
291 - I'm exhausted, man.\\
292 - Fez, my little man!\\
293 - How was your summer?\\
294 - Well, I saw a boob and a half
down by the pool.\\
295 - Yeah. Pool boob. Nice.\\
296 - Look. Donna,
I know you're nervous\\
297 - about seeing people at school
after running away and all,\\
298 - but I want you to know
it's all under control.\\
299 - I told everyone you
went away to have a baby.\\
300 - What?\\
301 - Yeah, it was badass.\\
302 - Oh, yeah, I say "badass" now.\\
303 - Hi, Daddy.\\
304 - Don't you "Daddy" me.\\
305 - Although it does sound good
to hear those words again.\\
306 - Bob.\\
307 - Right.\\
308 - You're in big trouble,
young lady.\\
309 - Now, get home.
Now. Move.\\
310 - Well,\\
311 - I guess that's what happens when
you disobey your parents, huh?\\
312 - Hey, why the long faces?\\
313 - Did you think that I...
No, no.\\
314 - Funny story. True story. I'm
walking home from the library\\
315 - and who should drive by?\\
316 - Kelso and Donna.\\
317 - Back from California.\\
318 - Where they were. Not me.\\
319 - Oh, hey, they know.\\
320 - What do you have
to say for yourself?\\
321 - I...\\
322 - I brought you a seashell.\\
323 - Just get in the house.\\
324 - Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?\\
325 - Oh, yeah.\\
326 - And it was worth it.\\
327 - Oh, not this again.
I told you, it gives me needs.\\
328 - Fine. We'll be upstairs.\\
329 - Too late.\\
330 - Man, why are we watching this?
It's stupid.\\
331 - You're stupid.\\
332 - Man, I've been gone all summer,\\
333 - and I get back, and
everything is just the same.\\
334 - I guess nothing ever
changes around here.
\subsection {Episode 02: I Can't Quit You Baby}
1 - Of all the dumb ass stunts
you kids ever pulled,\\
2 - this little California adventure
takes the dumb ass cake!\\
3 - We are very
disappointed in you, Eric,\\
4 - even though going to
California to rescue Donna\\
5 - is one of the most romantic
things I've ever heard of.\\
6 - That's true.
If he had gone by horse,\\
7 - they would have made it a movie.\\
8 - Look, Mr. Forman, before
you get all scary and pink,\\
9 - I just wanna say that\\
10 - running away to California was
completely selfish and immature.\\
11 - And, as for me,
as long as I live\\
12 - under your roof
and eat your food,\\
13 - I should be doing
things your way.\\
14 - What a load of crap!\\
15 - You two are not above the law.\\
16 - Now, Eric, hand over the
keys to the Vista Cruiser.\\
17 - What? Dad, no.\\
18 - The cruiser's my Batmobile.\\
19 - Without it, I'm just
a guy in a silly outfit.\\
20 - Now, Eric.\\
21 - A little time apart will
do you kids some good.\\
22 - So, Donna, I transferred you
to the Catholic high school,\\
23 - Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.\\
24 - What?\\
25 - That's right.
You're starting this week,\\
26 - so you better get out your Bible\\
27 - and brush up on
your Ten Commandments\\
28 - and that thing about the dwarfs.\\
29 - Oh, say can you see\\
30 - Oh, say can you see\\
31 - What the hell?
Fez!\\
32 - Oh, say can you see...\\
33 - Wait a second.\\
34 - You two look sweaty and guilty.\\
35 - Have you been eating my candy?\\
36 - What candy?\\
37 - I didn't say candy.\\
38 - And I certainly don't have
any candy hidden in the garage.\\
39 - I will be in the garage.\\
40 - Steven, that was way too close.\\
41 - You need to learn to keep
your hands off me.\\
42 - Me? You're the one who can't
keep her tongue to herself.\\
43 - Please. I let you fool
around with me out of pity.\\
44 - You know what your problem is?
You're really cute,\\
45 - so no one ever told you
to shut your piehole.\\
46 - You think I'm cute?\\
47 - Shut your piehole!\\
48 - Hanging out\\
49 - Down the street\\
50 - The same old thing\\
51 - We did last week\\
52 - Not a thing to do\\
53 - But talk to you\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
57 - Oh, Catholic school?\\
58 - That's rough.\\
59 - Yeah, my dad took
away my slingshot,\\
60 - so I'm feeling it
pretty bad, too.\\
61 - What were you guys doing?\\
62 - Huh? Oh, we're
just watching, um...\\
63 - This old lady's eating a fish.\\
64 - Look, Jackie,\\
65 - we've been avoiding each other.\\
66 - I think it's time we
hash this thing out.\\
67 - It's okay, I'm good.\\
68 - I can see you're
devastated over losing me.\\
69 - You know what, Michael?
I'm fine, really.\\
70 - You sound brave,\\
71 - but inside you're
a scrambled mess.\\
72 - Just remember this,
I'll always be there for you,\\
73 - in case you have
any physical needs, all right?\\
74 - Damn, Hyde.
What was that for?\\
75 - I just missed you, man.\\
76 - Wait. Donna, you're actually
gonna go to Catholic school?\\
77 - Not just Catholic school,
Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.\\
78 - That means "sad forever."\\
79 - Eric, we're never even
gonna see each other.\\
80 - Yeah, I know. And I can't
even drive you to school.\\
81 - And we can forget about
any lunchtime hokey-pokey.\\
82 - That's what it's all about.\\
83 - Man, it sucks not having a car.\\
84 - Well, I'm gonna go drive mine.\\
85 - Catch you guys later.\\
86 - Wait, wait, Steven.
Where are you going?\\
87 - What do you care?\\
88 - I don't.\\
89 - You know, I just remembered
that I have to go to the mall\\
90 - because they're having this
big Monday Madness sale.\\
91 - Jackie, it's Tuesday.\\
92 - See? Total madness!\\
93 - Poor kid, trying to
replace me with shopping.\\
94 - Eric, what are we gonna do?\\
95 - I mean, if I go to this school,
our senior year is ruined.\\
96 - I mean, we're not even
gonna graduate together.\\
97 - You know what? Bob is not
sending you to that Catholic school.\\
98 - Now, we're gonna
sit down, we're gonna\\
99 - figure out what we're gonna do.\\
100 - Guys? Let's get serious.\\
101 - It's simple.\\
102 - I'm gonna march over there
and talk to Bob.\\
103 - I love a good march.\\
104 - My birthday is in March.\\
105 - And then it's on to April.\\
106 - April showers.\\
107 - Oh! The Seduction
of Eric Forman,\\
108 - starring the insatiable
April Showers.\\
109 - Are you really gonna go
talk to my dad for me?\\
110 - Eric, you're so sweet and brave.\\
111 - Pound for pound, you're like
the bravest guy in the whole world.\\
112 - I love you so much!\\
113 - Well, my candy is safe.\\
114 - But something
was up with Jackie.\\
115 - She looked scared,\\
116 - like a deer in the headlights
with his pants down.\\
117 - Man, I feel sorry for Jackie.\\
118 - I mean, to have to look at this
all day and not be able to touch it?\\
119 - I can't even do that!\\
120 - I love you.\\
121 - I love you more.\\
122 - Sexy.\\
123 - Hey! You two quit it! Okay?
This circle is sacred.\\
124 - You don't do anything in here\\
125 - that you wouldn't do
in a church!\\
126 - No, no, wait. In a cemetery.\\
127 - No, wait.
In the teachers' lounge.\\
128 - Man, I've done it everywhere.\\
129 - Okay. This is
my Michael-box.\\
130 - I saved everything
that loser ever gave me.\\
131 - Hmm. One-year anniversary.\\
132 - What a moron!\\
133 - Well, you know, I guess
Kelso's really history for you.\\
134 - I never thought that'd happen
till you met someone else.\\
135 - You met someone else.\\
136 - What? Someone else?
That's crazy.\\
137 - You're crazy.\\
138 - Shut your piehole!\\
139 - Hey, check it out.\\
140 - I was at the bakery, and this crumb
cake came fresh out of the oven.\\
141 - And when I think
crumb cake, I think Bob.\\
142 - Uh-huh. What do you want?\\
143 - I wanna talk to you about
Donna and that Catholic school.\\
144 - Crumb cake isn't gonna
get me to change my mind.\\
145 - Are you sure?\\
146 - Those are real crumbs.\\
147 - She's going to that school,
and that's final.\\
148 - Okay. Fine.\\
149 - But know this, I am prepared to
fight this with every fiber of my being.\\
150 - On the other hand...\\
151 - You... You can't put a
price on good education.\\
152 - I can't believe
they're making you wear\\
153 - those knee-high socks every day.\\
154 - What the hell?\\
155 - Oh, my God.\\
156 - I'm blind!\\
157 - Jackie!
Get off me!\\
158 - Great outfit!\\
159 - Okay, so, um, what
exactly did you see?\\
160 - Hands, tongues, yours, his.
It was horrible!\\
161 - You were like Siamese twins
joined at the beard.\\
162 - Hey, it was her fault, man.
She threw herself at me.\\
163 - No, no. You were
on top of me.\\
164 - You pulled me.\\
165 - I've done a lot of partying,\\
166 - so, you know, my balance is off.\\
167 - This is impossible.
You two hate each other.\\
168 - Kelso is gonna freak out!\\
169 - Kelso!\\
170 - Settle down, Esmeralda.\\
171 - Kelso doesn't need
to know about this.\\
172 - Yeah, look, it's just
a meaningless fling, okay?\\
173 - We can stop whenever we want.\\
174 - Well, then maybe you should.\\
175 - Why do you even care?\\
176 - Because you're breaking up
the band, Yoko!\\
177 - Well, naughty ladies wear plaid.\\
178 - Fez, please.\\
179 - That's right. Beg for it,
sexy schoolgirl.\\
180 - Fez, we just caught
these two frenching,\\
181 - like a couple of French people
at a frenching festival.\\
182 - What? That's impossible.
You two hate each other.\\
183 - I said... I just said that.\\
184 - Okay, you are gonna tell us
how this happened right now.\\
185 - Ooh, I like it when you order
me around in that uniform.\\
186 - Okay, fine. Look, I'll just
tell you what happened.\\
187 - It was a few weeks
after Donna and Michael left,\\
188 - and Steven invited me over
to listen to a new record.\\
189 - Check it out.\\
190 - Isn't it the coolest?\\
191 - Don't you just wanna shake it?\\
192 - Wait.
Time out on the field.\\
193 - I don't shake it,
and I don't listen to Abba.\\
194 - Whatever, it's
my story. Anyway...\\
195 - I could totally tell
he was trying to make a move.\\
196 - Then he held me
real close and said...\\
197 - May I kiss you, milady?\\
198 - Hyde, I had no idea
you could be so formal.\\
199 - Come on.
She's so full of crap.\\
200 - Then why don't you tell us
what really happened, milady?\\
201 - Fine. Fine, okay?\\
202 - So, I'm hanging out in the
basement like I usually do,\\
203 - when Jackie showed up.
It was obvious she wanted me.\\
204 - I want you.
It's obvious.\\
205 - God, that's crazy.\\
206 - No, no, you so
came on to me first.\\
207 - You know, you said that you
didn't have a new boyfriend.\\
208 - He is not my boyfriend.\\
209 - I'm not her boyfriend.\\
210 - They just don't get it.
No. Why would they?\\
211 - Let's go, baby.\\
212 - I'm leaving, too.\\
213 - This basement's
tainted for me now.\\
214 - Well, I still wanna know\\
215 - how the hell all this happened.\\
216 - Another old lady. She
can't even reach the wheel!\\
217 - I can't watch The Price
is Right again, I just can't.\\
218 - God, this summer totally sucks.\\
219 - There's nothing to do.\\
220 - I bid $1, Bob.\\
221 - Hey. I'm gonna take Donna
to school. Oh! That's right.\\
222 - Dad took away my car\\
223 - when I did that really
super-romantic thing.\\
224 - Well, I guess we were
only reunited just to be\\
225 - ripped apart again.\\
226 - Like Romeo and Juliet.\\
227 - You know,\\
228 - why don't you take
the car this one time?\\
229 - It'll be our little secret.\\
230 - Okay.\\
231 - Shh!\\
232 - Where do you think you're going?\\
233 - Mom said I could.\\
234 - You just bought yourself
another week, kiddo.\\
235 - Look, Dad, I need my car.\\
236 - Don't you remember when
you were in high school?\\
237 - I bet you had some good times,\\
238 - driving around senior year
with your friends.\\
239 - My senior year, I was driving
a gunboat around Okinawa.\\
240 - And if you count the
Japanese snipers as my friends,\\
241 - then, yes, I had
some good times.\\
242 - You have to understand, Eric,\\
243 - it's not that your father's
trying to be a bad guy,\\
244 - it's just that he's been
irreparably damaged by war.\\
245 - I'm just sick of you doing
whatever the hell you want.\\
246 - Your father and I feel that you're
not taking yourself seriously.\\
247 - Hmm.\\
248 - You are such
a talented young man.\\
249 - Eric!\\
250 - Oh, uh...\\
251 - Yeah, forget about
the car. I gotta go.\\
252 - Oh, look how cute
in her little uniform!\\
253 - I'm gonna have to lock him in
his room and poke his eyes out.\\
254 - Here's what I don't get
about Fantasy Island.\\
255 - You know when you get off the
plane, and you see Mr. Roarke,\\
256 - and that little kid
in the white suit?\\
257 - Well, if it's me, I'm like,
"This is creepy," right?\\
258 - So, I just grab a free daiquiri,\\
259 - and I'm out of there.\\
260 - Whoa!
Whoa!\\
261 - Grow up, it's just a uniform.\\
262 - Sorry. You're right. I'm sorry.\\
263 - Man, that was totally
worth waiting for.\\
264 - I agree. Now we can go.\\
265 - How was your first day?\\
266 - Grim. This nun totally
spanked me with a ruler.\\
267 - Yet another reason
I wish I was a ruler.\\
268 - Wait a minute!
Weird!\\
269 - Okay. Now you guys are
sitting together?\\
270 - Oh, my God. You guys
aren't just fooling around.\\
271 - You care about her.\\
272 - I do not.
She sickens me.\\
273 - No, no, no. I'm the one
who's sickened, okay?\\
274 - I'm not supposed to be seen
with scruffy guys like you.\\
275 - I date guys I can
take out in public.\\
276 - Yet you continue
with this abomination!\\
277 - You know, you guys
have to tell Kelso.\\
278 - Or we'll tell Kelso.
Shall we?\\
279 - Wait. No, no, no.
Okay, guys. Look.\\
280 - What if we just
break it off right now?\\
281 - Look, there's nothing to even
break off, so it's fine by me.\\
282 - Yes. This is what
I wanna hear.\\
283 - It'll be like it never happened.\\
284 - Donna, come. Let us leave
this unholy thing behind.\\
285 - Steven, do I really sicken you?\\
286 - No.\\
287 - I sicken me, because
you're supposed to sicken me,\\
288 - but you don't.\\
289 - Well, I feel the same way.\\
290 - I mean, I like how
scruffy you are.\\
291 - Of course you do.\\
292 - Man, you know what?
Screw it.\\
293 - Let's just do what
we want, okay?\\
294 - Okay. What about Michael?\\
295 - Details, baby. Details.\\
296 - So, how's that uniform
working out for you?\\
297 - Stop.\\
298 - Do you feel like a good girl\\
299 - that just can't help being bad?\\
300 - Be bad, Donna.
I won't tell.\\
301 - Eric, it's not funny.\\
302 - I actually have to go to
this school every day now.\\
303 - Without... Without you.\\
304 - Okay, so, you know what? We'll
see each other nights and weekends,\\
305 - and I'll come
visit you at school.\\
306 - You know, I still have a bike.\\
307 - Eric, it's, like, 10 miles away.\\
308 - Ten... So what? These
legs were made for pedaling.\\
309 - Come on.\\
310 - You've seen my thighs.
Yeah.\\
311 - You're a good boyfriend.\\
312 - "You're a good boyfriend" who?\\
313 - I'm not calling you
Principal Forman.\\
314 - Don't make me get
the ruler, young lady.\\
315 - Red can take Eric's car,
but he can have my car candy\\
316 - when he pries it
from my cold, dead fingers.\\
317 - You were right.
10 miles is nothing.\\
318 - Will you pick me up
from school every day?\\
319 - Sure.\\
320 - Which arm hurts\\
321 - when you're about to
have a heart attack?\\
322 - Help.
\subsection {Episode 03: What Is and What Should Never Be (1)}
1 - Whatever. Whatever.\\
2 - Yeah, like I care.
All right. I'll talk to you later, Jackie.\\
3 - Ew! Do you mind not
getting all gooey and romantic\\
4 - when I'm about to eat
my breakfast?\\
5 - What crawled up your butt?\\
6 - You and Jackie.\\
7 - When you started
making out in there.\\
8 - Hey! No more butt-talk
at breakfast.\\
9 - Look, if you're not gonna
break up with Jackie,\\
10 - then you have
to tell Kelso, okay?\\
11 - It's, like,
the ethical thing to do.\\
12 - Thank you, Johnny Cub Scout.\\
13 - What are you gonna do, take
away my friendship merit badge?\\
14 - No, because Cub Scouts
are awarded achievement beads.\\
15 - Badges.\\
16 - - So, anybody hungry?
- Yeah.\\
17 - - Starved!
- Yeah, that sounds good.\\
18 - Ladies first.\\
19 - Or ladies only.\\
20 - Oh, well, um...
Well, it's not all for me.\\
21 - - I'm eating for two now.
- What?\\
22 - I'm pregnant.\\
23 - Oh, God. No!\\
24 - I mean, great!\\
25 - Hanging out\\
26 - Down the street\\
27 - The same old thing\\
28 - We did last week\\
29 - Not a thing to do\\
30 - But talk to you\\
31 - We're all all right\\
32 - We're all all right\\
33 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
34 - Kitty, are you sure
you're pregnant?\\
35 - Maybe you're just putting on
your winter weight.\\
36 - Red, a woman knows.\\
37 - Not to mention I'm late,
and not for work.\\
38 - For my menstrual cycle.
Hooray!\\
39 - That is great news,
Mrs. Forman.\\
40 - Now, stay away
from those smokes.\\
41 - If you smoke
when you're pregnant,\\
42 - they come out all spindly.\\
43 - Shut up.\\
44 - Mom, congratulations.
This is awesome.\\
45 - Please, love me the most.\\
46 - Well, you're sure being quiet
over there, Red.\\
47 - I'm soaking in the moment.\\
48 - Okay, I know this is unexpected,\\
49 - but I just think
it's gonna bring us\\
50 - so much happiness, don't you?\\
51 - Sure.\\
52 - You know how much I love babies.\\
53 - Oh, what a day.
I am so happy!\\
54 - I'm just gonna go throw up.\\
55 - I just don't understand
how this could have happened.\\
56 - Hmm. Maybe it's about time
we had the talk.\\
57 - You see,
when a boy loves a girl...\\
58 - - Doesn't have to love her.
- That's true.\\
59 - - Anywho, the boy's
sexual organ...
- Hey!\\
60 - Shut it, dumbass.\\
61 - That kid's gonna love it here.\\
62 - I can't believe
they're having a baby.\\
63 - I can't believe
they're still having sex.\\
64 - I mean, my Dad's back goes out
if you look at him wrong.\\
65 - - That's why she was
probably on top.
- Thanks.\\
66 - Thanks, Hyde. You just
killed a part of me.\\
67 - Yeah, that's why you gotta put
on your raincoat every damn time.\\
68 - Well, except for
the first time. Free pass!\\
69 - Oh, Kelso, that's just a myth.\\
70 - You're only safe if you do
it underwater. Right, Hyde?\\
71 - That's right, buddy.\\
72 - - Oops. Oh, a little help, Donna.
- Sure.\\
73 - Catch this, tool!\\
74 - - What was that for?
- You keep dropping the ball.\\
75 - Well, so I'm a butterfingers.
Isn't that punishment enough?\\
76 - Now look. The ball's all the
way over there in the backyard.\\
77 - Little help, Donna.\\
78 - God!
Fine, I'll get it! God!\\
79 - Hey, Steven.
I had fun last night.\\
80 - - You had fun doing what?
- Huh? Hey, Michael.\\
81 - Um, I went to the movies.
Right, Donna?\\
82 - Oh, um, I don't know.
I was with Eric all night.\\
83 - But I'm really interested
in this movie.\\
84 - Why don't you
tell us all about it?\\
85 - Donna?\\
86 - Fine.\\
87 - You know, it's that new movie,
starring that big, red whore.\\
88 - Oh, you mean, the one
where the big, red whore\\
89 - is sick of people
keeping secrets.\\
90 - No. No, no. The one
where the big, red whore\\
91 - keeps sticking her big, red nose\\
92 - in places
where it doesn't belong.\\
93 - Hey, watch what you say
about the big, red whore.\\
94 - Thank you, Eric. What did Sissy
Spacek ever do to any of you?\\
95 - Way to go, guys. You know
how he feels about Sissy!\\
96 - Fez, wait!\\
97 - Donna, what is with you?\\
98 - Look, I'm sick of covering for
your creepy, unnatural relationship.\\
99 - And I shouldn't have to.\\
100 - I mean, Hyde, you and Kelso
have been friends forever,\\
101 - and you owe it
to him to tell him.\\
102 - Yeah, this is way worse than
when you stole his headgear\\
103 - and used it to clean out
your sink.\\
104 - It was tough love, man.\\
105 - You know what? Forget it.\\
106 - You obviously don't care about
Kelso or any of the rest of us.\\
107 - Yeah, 'cause when this blows
up, guess what? We're all screwed.\\
108 - Steven, do you really think
we're a creepy, unnatural couple?\\
109 - Come on.
That's a crazy question.\\
110 - I mean, if this relationship wasn't
just a little bit creepy and unnatural,\\
111 - I wouldn't be in it.\\
112 - Oh, Eric, look.\\
113 - Your little, pink baby sweater.\\
114 - Oh, oh, and the matching
pink bonnet.\\
115 - Um...\\
116 - Had they explained to you yet
that I was a boy?\\
117 - - Oh, I am just so excited
about this baby.
- Well, yeah. You should be.\\
118 - And Dad should be, too.
What's with him anyway?\\
119 - Oh, no. That's just his way.
He'll be fine.\\
120 - When I first told him about you, he
said, "Oh, crap!" and stormed out.\\
121 - But then he came back
happy as a clam.\\
122 - And then, of course, when
you got older, he got mad again\\
123 - on account of you not being
so very good at sports.\\
124 - Don't worry about your father.
He'll come around. He always does.\\
125 - My banky-boo!\\
126 - Hey, Forman.\\
127 - So, I've decided I'm gonna
tell Kelso about me and Jackie.\\
128 - Well, well. I'm glad you finally
decided to listen to your conscience.\\
129 - It's not my conscience, man,
'cause I don't have a conscience.\\
130 - You know that.
It's just 'cause, you know,\\
131 - I figured me and Jackie might
be together a little while, so...\\
132 - But, man, she's the devil.\\
133 - What can I do? She's hot.\\
134 - No, you only think she's hot\\
135 - because she's made of hellfire.\\
136 - All right. What if you were
stranded on a desert island with her?\\
137 - Murder-suicide.\\
138 - Okay.\\
139 - Picture Jackie in a little
bikini made out of coconuts.\\
140 - Where is our signal fire?\\
141 - And don't give me any, "Oh,
boo-hoo, my hands are bleeding."\\
142 - Suck it up.\\
143 - Aw, damn, I got a splinter.\\
144 - You couldn't grab the tweezers
as the ship was going down?\\
145 - Moron.\\
146 - Well, that was unpleasant.\\
147 - Okay, try it again,
but this time do what I do.\\
148 - Good God, she is hot.\\
149 - Hey, guys.
What you talking about?\\
150 - Indy 500.\\
151 - - Nice.
- All right.\\
152 - Hey, can one of you guys give
me a ride to the DMV tomorrow?\\
153 - I lost my license in California.\\
154 - - Sure, Hyde'll take you.
- What?\\
155 - Yeah, it'll give you two
a chance to catch up.\\
156 - He can tell you how he spent
his summer break.\\
157 - Yeah. All right.\\
158 - - So what happened
to your license, man?
- Oh, a shark ate it.\\
159 - Really?\\
160 - How?\\
161 - Fine, I lost it.
You happy now?\\
162 - Oh, here you are.\\
163 - How are you feeling? Better?
I bet you're feeling better.\\
164 - I'm fine.\\
165 - Is that liquor on your breath?\\
166 - What is the matter
with you, Red?\\
167 - Well, you know...\\
168 - I mean...\\
169 - It's just...\\
170 - I'm not selling the Corvette!\\
171 - - What?
- Kids are expensive.\\
172 - That's gonna be
the first thing to go.\\
173 - I waited 25 years to have
that car because we had kids.\\
174 - And believe me, I love them.\\
175 - But this is supposed
to be our time.\\
176 - Kitty, people our age don't
have kids, they have grandkids.\\
177 - Well, we're having a kid,
so deal with it.\\
178 - Well, I'm having a Corvette,
so deal with that!\\
179 - Ooh, a staring contest.
I got winner.\\
180 - Okay, Mr. Red, it looks
like it's just you and me.\\
181 - Still the king.\\
182 - ...and here I am ecstatic, and Red comes
home babbling about his precious Corvette.\\
183 - Well, I'll tell you something.\\
184 - I may be the one who's pregnant,\\
185 - but I did not get that way
by myself.\\
186 - He's the one who wouldn't
go to sleep.\\
187 - You know, Mrs. Forman, there
are other ways of dealing with that.\\
188 - I mean, have you tried telling
him you just like him as a friend?\\
189 - You're carrying Red's baby. He
should be kissing your ass. God!\\
190 - Why are men such jerks?
Huh? Tell me.\\
191 - I just came in here
for the ice cream,\\
192 - so I'm just gonna
make mine and go.\\
193 - Men plant their seed
and think their work is done,\\
194 - but women have a being
growing inside of us\\
195 - the size of a wine jug.\\
196 - It's gotta come out somehow.\\
197 - Oh, oh, oh. It's like that
nature show, you know,\\
198 - where the snake eats
an antelope in one bite,\\
199 - and you're thinking,
"Impossible."\\
200 - And then it unhinges its jaw,
and in it goes.\\
201 - Well, giving birth is just like
that, only the other direction.\\
202 - And I need your father there, holding
my hand and telling me it's okay,\\
203 - because I can't swallow
an antelope alone.\\
204 - No, you can't, and no
woman should have to.\\
205 - That bastard.\\
206 - Ah, we've been here for,
like, an hour,\\
207 - we've only moved,
like, two feet.\\
208 - You think the lines
at the DMV are long?\\
209 - You should see the free clinic.\\
210 - Now, there's a wait.\\
211 - Man, you've been
to the free clinic?\\
212 - No.\\
213 - Oh, but I did see
your mom there. Burn!\\
214 - That's gonna
leave a mark. Just like your mom did!\\
215 - Come on. Move it! Damn!\\
216 - Gentlemen, I'm sorry
you had to see my dark side.\\
217 - Please excuse me. I'm gonna
get to the bottom of this. Ta-ta.\\
218 - Look, man, I gotta talk to you\\
219 - about some things that happened
while you were gone this summer.\\
220 - Hyde, if this is about free
ice cream, naked volleyball,\\
221 - or a dog wearing a hat and
sunglasses, I'd rather not even know.\\
222 - No, it's about Jackie.\\
223 - What about Jackie?\\
224 - She was with someone,
I knew it. Damn it!\\
225 - Well, you know, you guys are
broken up, so who cares, right?\\
226 - We're not...
I don't care. It's just...\\
227 - I mean, she was
a big part of my life,\\
228 - and I just hate the thought of her
being off with some random guy.\\
229 - Well, what if I told you it was with
a friend? Would that make it better?\\
230 - No. That would
make it worse, stupid.\\
231 - Oh, you're messing with me.\\
232 - Okay, 'cause I...
A friend would never do that.\\
233 - Oh, man, Hyde, you got me
again. Just like I got your mom!\\
234 - What is with the hitting?\\
235 - Guys?\\
236 - I love this place.
I want to work here.\\
237 - You just said you hated it.\\
238 - Yeah, but I went up
to the counter,\\
239 - and the guy treated me
like crap,\\
240 - but he was treating everybody
like crap. Poor, rich, black, white,\\
241 - we're all crap.\\
242 - And look at him. Think he
was popular in high school?\\
243 - No way. But now
he's the belle of the ball.\\
244 - Well, my friends, it's my turn
to get a taste of those balls.\\
245 - Hey. I was just inside with
Mom, and she's really upset, so...\\
246 - I just wanna know,
what's your problem?\\
247 - You made me bald.\\
248 - - What?
- Five generations,\\
249 - not one baldhead in my family.\\
250 - Then you came along, and...
Well, look at it!\\
251 - Children make me bald.\\
252 - You know what? Wear a hat.\\
253 - 'Cause Mom is really scared,\\
254 - and she could really use a
little damn support right now.\\
255 - And I don't usually
tell you what to do,\\
256 - 'cause you usually do the right
thing, but this time you didn't.\\
257 - You know how you're always telling
me to be a man? Well, be a man!\\
258 - I made you bald.
You made me skinny!\\
259 - Oh, hey. How'd it go at the
DMV? Did you tell Kelso?\\
260 - Nah, I blew it off.\\
261 - What? Why?\\
262 - I don't know.
It's just really hot in there.\\
263 - Really? 'Cause I think
you chickened out.\\
264 - No, I didn't chicken out, man.\\
265 - I just didn't wanna drop the news in
front of all those people, you know?\\
266 - I mean, haven't I done enough
to the guy?\\
267 - So, you felt bad?\\
268 - Oh, my God, you felt bad!\\
269 - No, I don't feel bad.
I don't feel anything.\\
270 - I don't know. I think someone's
been to Oz and gotten himself a heart.\\
271 - - Shut up, Forman.
- Yeah, Eric.\\
272 - Maybe we should lay off.
He's had a rough day.\\
273 - I really wanna lay off,
but it's just so hot in here.\\
274 - Get bent!\\
275 - He felt bad.\\
276 - - I think we really
got through to him.
- Yeah.\\
277 - - He's not gonna tell Kelso.
- No.\\
278 - Oh. So, you're
hiding out here.\\
279 - Got a call from some man
about a Corvette.\\
280 - What, you gonna buy another
one, so you can ride 'em around\\
281 - like a couple of water skis?\\
282 - - I'm selling the Corvette.
- What?\\
283 - Look, could we
finish this later?\\
284 - I'm kind of
in the middle of something.\\
285 - Is that Eric's old cradle?\\
286 - Yeah, well, the paint
was all chipped off,\\
287 - and I kind of remember that
they liked sleeping in this thing,\\
288 - when they weren't peeing
and pooping all over the place.\\
289 - Oh, Red. That is so sweet.\\
290 - Yeah, well,\\
291 - it might be fun.\\
292 - Hell, this time
we might even get an athlete.\\
293 - Oh!\\
294 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
295 - So, did you tell Michael yet?\\
296 - Oh, yeah, well, I was gonna, but, you
know, the timing just didn't seem right.\\
297 - Oh, I understand.\\
298 - I mean, it's kind of like... It's
kind of like setting your hair.\\
299 - If you don't wait long enough,
then it's totally flat and like Donna's,\\
300 - but if you wait
just the right amount of time,\\
301 - then it's perfect, like mine.\\
302 - - Steven, are you
even listening to me?
- God help me, I am.\\
303 - Steven.\\
304 - So, that's what
an adulteress is.\\
305 - I always thought
that it was a tiny adult.\\
306 - Hey, uh...\\
307 - Hey, buddy, what do you say we take
this party back in the living room, huh?\\
308 - Um, yeah, that's a good idea.\\
309 - No, but I want a peanut butter
and banana...\\
310 - Why is Hyde
kissing Jackie?\\
311 - What the hell?\\
312 - He's dead.\\
313 - They have a lot of questions
in the DMV application.\\
314 - Let's see. "Sex"?\\
315 - Please.\\
316 - Lots.\\
317 - "Address"?\\
318 - If I must, but I prefer pants.\\
319 - "State"?\\
320 - Nervous but excited.\\
321 - "Mother's maiden name"?\\
322 - Streisand, but she won't
acknowledge me.
\subsection {Episode 04: Heartbreaker (2)}
1 - HEH HEH HEH!\\
2 - WHY IS HYDE
KISSING JACKIE?\\
3 - WHAT THE HELL?\\

WITH THIS THING?\\
9 - WELL, THIS IS AGAINST MY
BETTER JUDGMENT, BUT...\\
10 - THANK YOU.\\
11 - NOW, HYDE'S REALLY DEAD.\\
12 - OW!\\
13 - THAT'S INVISIBLE!\\
14 - HANGIN' OUT\\
15 - DOWN THE STREET\\
16 - THE SAME OLD THING\\
17 - WE DID LAST WEEK\\
18 - NOT A THING TO DO\\
19 - BUT TALK TO YOU\\
20 - WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHT\\
21 - WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHT\\
22 - HELLO, WISCONSIN!\\
23 - DONNA, WE HAVE TO
STABILIZE HIM.\\
24 - WE'RE GONNA NEED PUDDING
AND LOTS OF IT.\\
25 - WHO CHOOSES A CHICK
OVER A FRIEND?\\
26 - WHAT? KELSO, COME ON.\\
27 - REMEMBER WHEN YOU MADE ME
WALK HOME IN A BLIZZARD\\
28 - BECAUSE YOU WANTED
10 EXTRA MINUTES\\
29 - TO MAKE OUT
WITH PAM MACY?\\
30 - NO, BUT I DIDN'T STEAL
PAM MACY FROM YOU,\\
31 - AND YOU COULD'VE PLAYED IN
THE SNOW UNTIL WE WERE DONE.\\
32 - KELSO, TRY TO LOOK
AT THE FACTS.\\
33 - JACKIE WANTED TO GET
MARRIED, SO YOU BAILED,\\
34 - SO SHE FOUND
SOMEONE ELSE,\\
35 - SO NOW SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO MARRY YOU.\\
36 - THIS SOLVES
YOUR PROBLEM.\\
37 - ALBEIT WITH AN
UNPLEASANT TWIST ENDING.\\
38 - NO, I DON'T CARE.
I'M KICKING HYDE'S ASS.\\
39 - WHOA, KELSO,
KELSO, COME ON.\\
40 - YOU COULDN'T OPEN
MY KITCHEN DOOR.\\
41 - I MEAN...\\
42 - SERIOUSLY. THINK ABOUT HOW
THIS PLAN USUALLY TURNS OUT.\\
43 - AAH!\\
44 - UNH!\\
45 - THAT'S MY EYE!\\
46 - HEH HEH HEH!
NICE.\\
47 - UH-OH.\\
48 - OW! MY EYE!\\
49 - BASTARD!\\
50 - NO, STOP!\\
51 - IT'S MY BUTT PRINT.\\
52 - LOOK AT IT!
NO TWO ARE THE SAME... OW!\\
53 - MY EYE!\\
54 - WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?\\
55 - I MEAN, HE BROKE THE CODE.
HE'S WRONG.\\
56 - YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.\\
57 - HE'S LIKE
MY OLDEST FRIEND,\\
58 - AND HE STABBED ME
IN THE BACK.\\
59 - SO, KELSO, HOW MANY
THINGS AROUND HERE\\
60 - HAVE YOU PUT
YOUR BUTT ON?\\
61 - LET'S START WITH WHAT I
HAVEN'T PUT MY BUTT ON.\\
62 - OH, JUST A MOMENT.\\
63 - RED, IT'S SOMEBODY ABOUT
BUYING THE CORVETTE.\\
64 - UGH!\\
65 - WELL, MARLIN,
WE'VE JUST SEEN\\
66 - THE MALE OF THE HERD
GRUNT HIS DISPLEASURE.\\
67 - BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?\\
68 - THE GRUNTING INDICATES
AGGRESSION, JIM.\\
69 - AHH!\\
70 - IDIOTS.\\
71 - I AM ABOUT TO SELL
SOMETHING SPECIAL TO ME\\
72 - BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING
ANOTHER BABY,\\
73 - AND TO DO THAT,
I HAVE TO BELIEVE\\
74 - THAT THIS CHILD WON'T
TURN OUT A SMART ASS.\\
75 - HELLO.\\
76 - YES.\\
77 - DON'T CALL HERE AGAIN.\\
78 - WELL,
WHAT HAPPENED?\\
79 - OH, THE GUY SOUNDED
LIKE HE WAS EATING.\\
80 - I DON'T WANT SOME FAT
BASTARD EATING IN MY CAR.\\
81 - ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO THE
DOCTOR'S THIS AFTERNOON\\
82 - BECAUSE
I'M PREGNANT!\\
83 - OH, OH,
AND YOU'RE PICKING\\
84 - YOUR GRANDPARENTS UP
FROM THE AIRPORT.\\
85 - I'M GOING
TO TELL THEM\\
86 - THAT I'M PREGNANT!\\
87 - THEY GET IN
FROM PHOENIX AT 5:00.\\
88 - YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
WHEN THEY MOVED TO ARIZONA\\
89 - THEY'D GET LOSE
IN THE DESERT.\\
90 - WHAT'S WRONG WITH
MRS. FORMAN'S PARENTS?\\
91 - NOTHING. THEY'RE JUST... THEY'RE...
VERY COMPLICATED PEOPLE\\
92 - WHO CAN'T BE SUMMED UP
IN A COUPLE OF WORDS.\\
93 - GRANDMA YELLS.
GRANDPA DRINKS.\\
94 - THAT PRETTY MUCH
SUMMED IT UP.\\
95 - NOW, THAT IS NOT TRUE. MY
FATHER IS A WONDERFUL MAN\\
96 - WHO JUST GETS
A LITTLE SLEEPY.\\
97 - AND MY MOTHER, WELL...\\
98 - FINE,
IS A LITTLE REMOTE.\\
99 - WHICH, I HAVE LEARNED
THROUGH MANY HELPFUL BOOKS,\\
100 - MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
HER TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU."\\
101 - EVEN IF IT'S THE ONLY
THING IN THE WORLD\\
102 - A SAD LITTLE GIRL
NEEDS TO HEAR.\\
103 - AND WHICH IS WHY I SAY
IT TO YOU EVERY DAY.\\
104 - ERIC, I LOVE YOU.\\
105 - HEH HEH HEH!\\
106 - AND YOU, TOO,
STEVEN.\\
107 - I LOVE YOU!\\
108 - OH, YEAH, NO, THAT'S OK,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...\\
109 - NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT...
OK, I LOVE YOU, TOO!\\
110 - I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU KNEW\\
111 - THAT JACKIE AND HYDE
WERE TOGETHER\\
112 - AND YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME.\\
113 - WE... BARELY KNEW.\\
114 - YEAH, WE KNEW, BUT
WE WERE IN DENIAL\\
115 - BECAUSE IT'S
SO UNNATURAL.\\
116 - LIKE RADIOACTIVE
SPIDERS.\\
117 - WELL, THAT'S TRUE.\\
118 - IT'S JUST, HOW COULD HYDE
DO THIS TO ME?\\
119 - UH-OH, SOUNDS LIKE
HE KNOWS.\\
120 - FINALLY!\\
121 - WHAT, YOUR MOM KNEW?!\\
122 - AND FEZ?!\\
123 - FEZ NEVER KNOWS
ANYTHING!\\
124 - I KNOW. I'M REALLY
COMING INTO MY OWN.\\
125 - WHATEVER.\\
126 - YOU KNOW, NONE OF THIS
IS AS BAD\\
127 - AS HYDE NOT TELLING ME.\\
128 - YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?\\
129 - I'M GONNA MAKE HIM TELL ME.\\
130 - HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DO THAT?\\
131 - BY OUTWITTING HIM
CONVERSATIONALLY.\\
132 - WHAT A FINE GAME\\
133 - OF CAT AND MOUSE
IT WILL BE.\\
134 - I'M GONNA GO FIND
AN EYE PATCH.\\
135 - SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY?\\
136 - OH, IT'LL COME TO
ME IN THE MOMENT.\\
137 - DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD PLAN IT OUT A LITTLE?\\
138 - DOES AN ASTRONAUT
PLAN OUT HIS MISSIONS?\\
139 - WHAT HAPPENS
IN CAT AND MOUSE\\
140 - IF THE CAT IS RETARDED?\\
141 - OH, YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE.\\
142 - WHAT'S UP?\\
143 - THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION, HYDE.\\
144 - WHAT IS UP?\\
145 - WELL, I GUESS YOU KNOW
ABOUT ME AND JACKIE.\\
146 - AHA!\\
147 - SO THE BATTLE
OF WITS HAS BEGUN!\\
148 - WHAT BATTLE OF WITS?
I ADMIT IT.\\
149 - I'M MESSING AROUND
WITH JACKIE.\\
150 - I HATE YOU!\\
151 - OW! MY EYE!\\
152 - THANKS AGAIN FOR
THE DREAM CATCHERS.\\
153 - A BLIND INDIAN WITH 3
FINGERS MADE THOSE.\\
154 - IT WAS QUITE A THING TO WATCH.\\
155 - WOW. I WONDER
IF HIM BEING BLIND\\
156 - HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THE LOSING THE FINGERS.\\
157 - ACTUALLY, I THINK
THEY WERE TAKEN\\
158 - AS PART OF A PRIMITIVE
MANHOOD RITUAL.\\
159 - SO, ERIC, I KIND OF LIKE
YOUR GRANDPARENTS.\\
160 - WHAT WERE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?\\
161 - WAIT FOR IT.\\
162 - BURT, SWEETIE, I THINK
THAT CAR'S TRYING TO PASS.\\
163 - WHY DON'T YOU
MOVE OVER?\\
164 - OH, HE'S FINE.\\
165 - HONEY, I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD MOVE OVER.\\
166 - SWEETIE, HE CAN
GO AROUND.\\
167 - MOVE!\\
168 - I'M MOVING.\\
169 - AND WHEN HE SAW
YOU GUYS KISSING,\\
170 - HE JUST FELL APART.
I MEAN, IT WAS AWFUL.\\
171 - AND THEN HE RAN INTO
THE SCREEN DOOR.\\
172 - OHH. HE'S JUST
SO BAD AT DOORS.\\
173 - LOOK...\\
174 - IF YOU DON'T WORK
THINGS OUT WITH KELSO,\\
175 - EVERYBODY'S GONNA
CHOOSE SIDES,\\
176 - AND NOBODY'S GONNA BE
FRIENDS ANYMORE.\\
177 - WELL, THAT'S
NOT MY FAULT.\\
178 - LOOK, HE DESERTED ME.
HE BROKE MY HEART.\\
179 - I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.\\
180 - YOU'RE DATING
HIS BEST FRIEND!\\
181 - YOU'VE GOTTA TALK TO HIM.\\
182 - YOU OWE HIM
AN EXPLANATION.\\
183 - UGH! THAT'S JUST
SO NOT THE WAY\\
184 - I WANTED
TO SPEND THE DAY.\\
185 - WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO SPEND THE DAY\\
186 - WIPING TEARS AND PUDDING
OFF OF KELSO'S CHEEK.\\
187 - BURT, HONEY,\\
188 - WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER
AND SIT WITH US?\\
189 - I'M FINE HERE.\\
190 - WE'D REALLY LIKE IT\\
191 - IF YOU WOULD SIT
AND JOIN THE PARTY.\\
192 - I'M PART OF THE PARTY
RIGHT HERE.\\
193 - SIT!\\
194 - SO, BURT,
YOU'RE LOOKING FIT.\\
195 - DRY HEAT
AND CENTRAL AIR,\\
196 - THAT'S THE KEY.\\
197 - UH-HUH.\\
198 - I'VE EVEN GOT AN
AIR-CONDITIONED GARAGE.\\
199 - WE COULD GO FROM
THE HOUSE TO THE CAR\\
200 - WITHOUT EVER
FEELING THE HEAT.\\
201 - WOW.\\
202 - THEY LITERALLY NEVER HAVE
TO BREATHE FRESH AIR, WOW.\\
203 - WHO NEEDS IT?\\
204 - YEP.\\
205 - WELL, THOSE ARE SOME
REAL NICE SANDALS, BURT.\\
206 - HARDLY EVER
SEE THOSE ON MEN.\\
207 - ALSO MADE BY
THE HANDICAPPED INDIAN.\\
208 - WHAT SPIRIT.\\
209 - OH, UM,
EVERYBODY'S HERE.\\
210 - HELLO, MOM, DADDY.\\
211 - KITTY, TELL EVERYONE YOUR
WONDERFUL NEWS. QUICK.\\
212 - UM, I'D REALLY RATHER
NOT RIGHT NOW, RED.\\
213 - BUT THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE.\\
214 - YEAH, FOR THE LOVE
OF GOD, MOM, TELL THEM.\\
215 - NO, I SAID
NOT RIGHT NOW.\\
216 - KITTY, THEY CAME
ALL THIS WAY.\\
217 - YEAH, COME ON.\\
218 - FINE. YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE BIG NEWS?\\
219 - THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
I STARTED MENOPAUSE.\\
220 - KITTY, LANGUAGE!\\
221 - YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?\\
222 - NO, NO, JUST BARREN.
TALK ABOUT THAT.\\
223 - MOM,
I'M REALLY SORRY.\\
224 - I KNEW
YOU WANTED A BABY,\\
225 - BUT I'M NOT REALLY
SURE WHAT TO SAY,\\
226 - MAINLY BECAUSE...\\
227 - I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT MENOPAUSE IS.\\
228 - ARE YOU GONNA, LIKE,
LOSE YOUR HAIR?\\
229 - SHUT UP.\\
230 - SHE'S NOT LOSING
ANYTHING.\\
231 - THIS JUST MEANS...\\
232 - FROM TIME TO TIME...\\
233 - A WOMAN'S BODY...\\
234 - AHEM!\\
235 - KITTY, EXPLAIN IT
TO THE BOY.\\
236 - I'M JUST GETTING
SOME JUICE.\\
237 - HEY, MOM. MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK TO GRANDMA ABOUT THIS.\\
238 - WELL, THAT'S AN IDEA.\\
239 - I MEAN, WE'RE JUST
IGNORAMUSES.\\
240 - OK, OK, SCOOT.\\
241 - IS IT... IS IT LIKE
A LADY PARTS THING?\\
242 - WE'LL LOOK IT UP
IN THE WORLD BOOK.\\
243 - OH, THOSE COOKIES
LOOK GOOD.\\
244 - WELL, THANKS.\\
245 - SORRY
I MADE A SCENE.\\
246 - OH, YOU WERE
JUST TIRED.\\
247 - NO, I WASN'T
JUST TIRED.\\
248 - MOM, I'M HAVING
A REALLY HARD TIME HERE.\\
249 - DID IT HIT YOU
THIS HARD, TOO?\\
250 - DID WHAT, DEAR?\\
251 - MENOPAUSE.\\
252 - OH!\\
253 - I NEVER HAD IT.\\
254 - MOM, EVERYBODY HAS IT.\\
255 - WELL, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
QUITE HEALTH-CONSCIOUS.\\
256 - I TOLD YOU TO EAT
MORE VEGETABLES.\\
257 - YOU CANNOT
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE\\
258 - THAT YOU NEVER WENT
THROUGH MENOPAUSE.\\
259 - - WELL, I DIDN'T.
- YES, YOU DID!\\
260 - WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE
IT'S NOT NICE TO TALK ABOUT.\\
261 - WELL, NOT EVERYTHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE\\
262 - TALKED ABOUT
HAS TO BE NICE.\\
263 - MOM, WHY DON'T YOU
EVER REALLY TALK TO ME?\\
264 - I TOLD YOU
I LIKED YOUR COOKIES.\\
265 - I'M GONNA FIND
YOUR FATHER.\\
266 - BURT!\\
267 - IS SHE GONE?\\
268 - YOU KNOW,
THAT WOMAN IS CRAZY.\\
269 - YOUR MOTHER
JUST DOESN'T KNOW\\
270 - HOW TO TALK
TO PEOPLE.\\
271 - IF SHE YELLS AT YOU,\\
272 - SHE REALLY MEANS THAT
SHE'S SORRY YOU'RE UPSET.\\
273 - AND IF SHE BREAKS
ALL YOUR GOLF CLUBS,\\
274 - SHE MEANS
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY."\\
275 - OH, DADDY, I LOVE YOU.\\
276 - I LOVE YOU, PUMPKIN. AND
SO DOES YOUR MOTHER.\\
277 - BURT!\\
278 - YOU NEVER SAW ME.\\
279 - TRY TO GET
MY EYE NOW!\\
280 - AAH!\\
281 - HYDE, GET OFF!\\
282 - NOT UNTIL YOU CALM DOWN.\\
283 - AHH! A WET ONE!\\
284 - FEZ, I'M GONNA
GET FREE EVENTUALLY,\\
285 - AND THEN I'M GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS.\\
286 - KELSO, LOOK, MAN,
WE NEED TO SETTLE THIS.\\
287 - NO, I DON'T WANT
TO SETTLE THIS.\\
288 - I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.\\
289 - ALL I WANT TO DO
IS POUND YOU\\
290 - SO YOU CAN FEEL
AS BAD AS I DO.\\
291 - FINE. FAIR ENOUGH.\\
292 - GO AHEAD AND HIT ME.
A FREE SHOT.\\
293 - YOU GONNA
HIT ME BACK?\\
294 - NO, MAN. THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL IT A FREE SHOT.\\
295 - OH. OK.\\
296 - GET READY.\\
297 - HERE IT COMES.\\
298 - IT'S COMING.\\
299 - GET READY.\\
300 - WE'RE READY!
DO IT, FOOL!\\
301 - YOU KNOW WHAT?\\
302 - FORGET IT.\\
303 - IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE ANYTHING.\\
304 - I JUST...\\
305 - FORGET IT.\\
306 - LOOK, KELSO...\\
307 - I DIDN'T PLAN
FOR THIS, BUT...\\
308 - LOOK, I'M SORRY, OK?\\
309 - I'M... I'M REALLY SORRY.\\
310 - Both: AWW!\\
311 - WOULD YOU GET BENT?\\
312 - SO, WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO NOW?\\
313 - I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO.\\
314 - YOU TWO ARE GONNA
SHAKE HANDS,\\
315 - AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE DONE WITH IT.\\
316 - NUH-UH.\\
317 - COME ON.
GIVE IT A TRY.\\
318 - SHAKE HANDS.\\
319 - I DON'T WANNA.\\
320 - SHAKE!\\
321 - HEY.\\
322 - WELL, WELL.
LOOK WHO IT IS.\\
323 - UGH. LOOK, MICHAEL,
I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.\\
324 - HOW'S YOUR EYE?\\
325 - WHAT DO YOU CARE?\\
326 - OK, LOOK, MICHAEL,\\
327 - I KNOW WE SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU SOONER,\\
328 - BUT NOT I'M GONNA
SAY I'M SORRY,\\
329 - BECAUSE I WANTED YOU, AND
YOU LEFT AND BROKE MY HEART.\\
330 - AND I LIKE STEVEN NOW,\\
331 - SO YOU NEED
TO GET OVER IT\\
332 - SO WE CAN ALL
BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN.\\
333 - APOLOGY ACCEPTED.\\
334 - HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.\\
335 - OW!\\
336 - MY EYE.\\
337 - YEAH.\\
338 - HEY.\\
339 - HOW YOU DOING?\\
340 - OH, GREAT.\\
341 - IT'S SO NICE TO NO LONGER
BE A WOMAN.\\
342 - KITTY,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.\\
343 - YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN... I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO THINK\\
344 - WHAT I COULD DO TO
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,\\
345 - AND I FINALLY CAME
UP WITH SOMETHING.\\
346 - I SENT YOUR PARENTS
HOME EARLY.\\
347 - THAT KIND OF HELPS.\\
348 - I JUST... I REALLY
WANTED TO BE PREGNANT.\\
349 - YOU KNOW WHAT
THE REAL KICKER IS?\\
350 - THIS MORNING,
WHEN WE THOUGHT\\
351 - YOU WERE STILL
PREGNANT...\\
352 - I SOLD MY CORVETTE.\\
353 - HA HA HA HA HA!\\
354 - HA HA HA HA HA!\\
355 - HA HA! OH-HO-HO!\\
356 - OH-HO-HO!\\
357 - OHH!\\
358 - "MEMORIAL DAY,
MENINGITIS..."\\
359 - OK, HERE WE GO.
"MENOPAUSE."\\
360 - GOOD GOD. I DIDN'T THINK
THEY'D HAVE PICTURES.\\
361 - WELL...\\
362 - AT LEAST THEY USE THE
WORD "UTERUS" A LOT.\\
363 - I COULD'VE GONE
A WHOLE LIFETIME\\
364 - WITHOUT KNOWING
THEY HAD A MUCOUS MEMBRANE.\\
365 - YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST...\\
366 - YOU CAN'T UNLEARN
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?\\
367 - OH, NO, LOOK AT
THE SYMPTOMS.\\
368 - "TEMPERAMENTAL
BEHAVIOR, MOOD SWINGS,\\
369 - FACIAL HAIR."\\
370 - UH-OH, DAD...\\
371 - I THINK YOU HAVE
MENOPAUSE.\\
372 - HEY, ERIC, CAN YOU
HAND ME A COOKIE?\\
373 - UM, I CAN'T REACH
WHILE I'M DRIVING.\\
374 - COME ON, PLEASE?
JUST ONE COOKIE.\\
375 - JUST WAIT
TILL I STOP.\\
376 - COOKIE!\\
377 - YOU KNOW, DONNA,\\
378 - YOU CATCH MORE FLIES
WITH SUGAR.\\
379 - RIGHT, BURT?
\subsection {Episode 05: Ramble On}
1 - You know, Eric, I'm really happy
with our relationship right now.\\
2 - Yeah, me, too. It's like we're way
past "the broken up and miserable" stage\\
3 - and we're back in the
"having sex again" stage, so...\\
4 - Yeah. Thumbs up
from this end, too. Yeah.\\
5 - I'm serious. I mean,
we've been through a lot\\
6 - and even though some of it
wasn't exactly fun...\\
7 - I mean, it was worth it, because now
we know that we can handle anything.\\
8 - And we don't freak out
about the little stuff.\\
9 - Right.\\
10 - Like that time we got in that big
fight because I ran over your cat.\\
11 - That wasn't little stuff.
I really loved that cat.\\
12 - Yeah. No. Yeah. No, I know.
I mean, the cat was little.\\
13 - Anyway, when you came to
California, I knew you were the one.\\
14 - So I got you a gift to
symbolize how far we've come.\\
15 - Is it, like, one of those
gifts that women get for men,\\
16 - but they actually
wear themselves?\\
17 - Here.\\
18 - It's a ring.\\
19 - Yeah.\\
20 - And I'm a man.\\
21 - Yeah. It's a man-ring.\\
22 - A man-ring.\\
23 - Yeah!\\
24 - Hanging out\\
25 - Down the street\\
26 - The same old thing\\
27 - We did last week\\
28 - Not a thing to do\\
29 - But talk to you\\
30 - We're all all right\\
31 - We're all all right\\
32 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
33 - Morning.\\
34 - What the hell's
that thing on your finger?\\
35 - This is my new man-ring.\\
36 - Donna got it for me,
so I'll feel right at home\\
37 - when the gypsies come to town.\\
38 - Well, take it off.\\
39 - You look like some
kind of fruity magician.\\
40 - Well, I think it's sweet.\\
41 - I can enjoy these things now\\
42 - because I am not gonna let
menopause get me down.\\
43 - Mmm-mmm. No depression,
night sweats,\\
44 - or sudden mood swings for me.\\
45 - Well, I guess
that's starting today, huh?\\
46 - 'Cause last night
you hit the trifecta there.\\
47 - Well, I just refuse to be sad\\
48 - about the fact that I'm never
gonna have another baby.\\
49 - I don't need another baby.\\
50 - I got a lot to look forward to.\\
51 - Like picking out my casket.\\
52 - - Oh, Kitty.
- I...\\
53 - It's okay.\\
54 - You've still got Eric.\\
55 - He's sort of a baby.\\
56 - I'll make him cry if you want.\\
57 - Man, that is one big-ass ring!\\
58 - Hey, maybe people will think
you won the Super Bowl.\\
59 - Nah. Nobody'd believe that.\\
60 - But he could be the sick little
kid the whole team rallies around.\\
61 - Well, guys, wish me luck.\\
62 - Today I have a job interview\\
63 - at the Department
of Motor Vehicles.\\
64 - All right. Good luck, man.\\
65 - Oh, Eric.\\
66 - What a glorious man-ring.\\
67 - See, I told you to accessorize
and you finally listened, huh?\\
68 - - Man, you like it?
- Yeah. What's not to like?\\
69 - It's hypnotic. It looks like
he has superpowers.\\
70 - I'd like to see the lame-o
superhero that had to wear that ring.\\
71 - Okay, super pals, I need
a danger alert status report.\\
72 - My sensors indicate peace and
quiet throughout the universe.\\
73 - I think the oceans are secure, but I
cannot check for another 45 minutes\\
74 - because I just ate.\\
75 - - Hi, guys.
- No.\\
76 - You've been brainwashed and
forced to wear this hideously ugly ring!\\
77 - Actually, it's a gift.
From me.\\
78 - Form of, the worst gift ever.\\
79 - Shape of...
Hope you kept the receipt.\\
80 - Oh, no! Alien zombies
are attacking the Earth.\\
81 - - Let's swing
into action, gang.
- Hang on a second!\\
82 - We're still on this ring.\\
83 - Are you sure it's not
an evil alien artifact?\\
84 - I got it at the mall.\\
85 - Greetings, super dumb asses.\\
86 - Oh, no! It's Dr. Bald.\\
87 - Any minute now, my army
of alien zombies will be inva...\\
88 - Good Lord!
That is an ugly ring!\\
89 - Hey, alien zombies,
get a load of that ring!\\
90 - - All right. That's it. This thing's coming off.
- Oh, whoa! Be careful, man.\\
91 - You drop something
that big and heavy,\\
92 - it'll throw off
the Earth's rotation.\\
93 - We'll all go
crashing into the sun.\\
94 - Way to use science in a burn.\\
95 - Donna, guess who hates
the ring you got him?\\
96 - Eric hates the ring?\\
97 - - He told me he loved it.
- Well, see...\\
98 - Eric told Steven
that the ring was so ugly\\
99 - that the Elephant Man wears it
to distract people from his face.\\
100 - That ring is beautiful.\\
101 - You know, what's ugly
is his bony little finger.\\
102 - Hey, you know what?
If he can't appreciate it,\\
103 - let's just take it back
and buy me something pretty.\\
104 - According to your application, your
last job was as Dancer Number 3\\
105 - in the school production
of My Fair Lady.\\
106 - Yes. It was magical.\\
107 - I Could Have Danced All Night.\\
108 - Uh-huh. I'm afraid
your theater experience\\
109 - doesn't really apply to
working here at the DMV.\\
110 - But, Nina, what is the DMV
really, if not one big stage?\\
111 - The DMV is the Department of
Motor Vehicles. It is not a stage.\\
112 - Ah, but in a way,
they're very similar.\\
113 - - No, they're not.
- Oh, but really they are.\\
114 - - No, they're not.
- Okay.\\
115 - - They are.
- No, they're not!\\
116 - I'm just gonna put down
no prior experience.\\
117 - Fair enough.\\
118 - Ah, but you haven't asked me
about my special skills yet.\\
119 - Well, I really don't see how
a fondness for pie is relevant.\\
120 - But, Nina, what is the DMV
really, if not one big pie shop?\\
121 - Great. Clicker's on the fritz.\\
122 - All I want to do is see the end of
Guiding Light, and it won't click.\\
123 - Click, damn it! Click!\\
124 - Kitty?\\
125 - I think your lady problem
is acting up again.\\
126 - It just won't click, that's all.\\
127 - It's supposed to click, Red.
It's a clicker. That's what it does.\\
128 - Okay. Let's get you to bed.\\
129 - Okay, you guys, very important.\\
130 - Donna's coming over, and
I lost the ring she gave me.\\
131 - - I thought
I had it in the basement...
- Eric, please!\\
132 - Your mother
is having a breakdown.\\
133 - No. The only thing having a
breakdown around here is the clicker!\\
134 - Why won't it click, Red?
Nothing loves me!\\
135 - Okay, Eric.
Jackie just told me\\
136 - that Hyde told her
that you hate the ring.\\
137 - Uh-oh.\\
138 - I happen to think
it's beautiful.\\
139 - Besides, that is what
a man-ring looks like.\\
140 - Well, you know, Donna, maybe
I'm just not a man-ring kind of guy.\\
141 - I mean, I like man-pants
and man-shirts.\\
142 - Eric, you could've just told me
you didn't like it when I gave it to you.\\
143 - You know what?
Just give it back.\\
144 - I absolutely will\\
145 - just as soon as I find it.\\
146 - What?\\
147 - How could you lose it?\\
148 - I told you it was a symbol of
our loving freaking relationship!\\
149 - And my losing it is a symbol\\
150 - of how much I love
and respect you?\\
151 - I need cold compresses
and a Bloody Mary. Quick!\\
152 - Your mother is talking about
adopting a communist orphan.\\
153 - Now move.
I need help, damn it!\\
154 - I don't understand. How
could I lose a 25-pound ring?\\
155 - I once lost a six-foot-long
rubber chilidog.\\
156 - And I still haven't found it.
It's just gone!\\
157 - You know what, Hyde?
This whole thing's your fault.\\
158 - You're the one who told Jackie
I didn't like the ring.\\
159 - Hyde stabbed you in the back?\\
160 - No. He wouldn't do
anything like that.\\
161 - Like he didn't steal Jackie
from me. Oh, wait a minute!\\
162 - Look, man,
I told her not to tell.\\
163 - Yeah. And I told you
not to tell.\\
164 - You and Jackie
are gossiping now?\\
165 - You know, the more
you two go out,\\
166 - the more
like each other you get.\\
167 - Yeah. Who knows what you and
your little girlfriend are gonna be like\\
168 - in a couple months.\\
169 - Two, four, six, eight.\\
170 - Who do we appreciate? Go team!\\
171 - - Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo! Number one! Yeah!\\
172 - Jackie? I heard
the best piece of gossip.\\
173 - Eric Forman doesn't have
any school spirit.\\
174 - - I'm telling everyone!
- Too late. I already did.\\
175 - First of all,
Jackie is not my girlfriend.\\
176 - And second of all, I'm not the only
one who spills stuff around here.\\
177 - Yeah. You're right.\\
178 - Hey, Kelso. Hyde watches
Little House on the Prairie.\\
179 - Little House on the Prairie?\\
180 - It reminds me of a simpler time.\\
181 - How could Eric lose that ring?\\
182 - And more importantly, how
could he think it was ugly?\\
183 - It's got real
nugget-gold plating\\
184 - and the abalone is inlaid.\\
185 - If you were my girlfriend, I
would be proud to wear that ring.\\
186 - Heck, I'd wear it if you just
wanted to fool around a little.\\
187 - Get my drift, Big D?\\
188 - All I know is, you guys better
watch what you say around here.\\
189 - Some people can't be trusted because
they have a great, big mouth, Jackie!\\
190 - How could you say that?\\
191 - My mouth is in perfect
proportion to the rest of my face.\\
192 - Plenty of classy men wear rings.\\
193 - Wayne Newton. The Pope.
My Uncle Carmine from Hoboken.\\
194 - You lose his ring,
you wake up in a dumpster.\\
195 - And that's just a warning!\\
196 - Now I think that's all the questions
I have about your application.\\
197 - Okay, but one thing
my application doesn't say\\
198 - is how much I would
apply myself to the job here.\\
199 - I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop making puns now.\\
200 - I really don't think this
is going to work out, so...\\
201 - Wow! That is
a gorgeous man-ring.\\
202 - You know, wearing a ring this
big shows a lot of confidence.\\
203 - Well, I do feel like a king
when I wear it.\\
204 - And, you know, what is the DMV
really, if not one big kingdom?\\
205 - You know what?\\
206 - You're stubborn, under qualified,
and you barely speak English.\\
207 - Welcome to the DMV.\\
208 - Wait a minute. You're mad at
me for telling Donna a secret?\\
209 - Steven, I tell secrets.
It's who I am.\\
210 - Look, all I'm saying is, if
you're gonna be my girlfriend,\\
211 - you can't go running around, shooting
off your big, fat, cheerleader mouth.\\
212 - You just called me
your girlfriend.\\
213 - No, I didn't.\\
214 - - Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.\\
215 - - Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.\\
216 - Yes, you did, and shut up.
You're ruining it!\\
217 - Okay, now listen to me.\\
218 - I'll keep my mouth shut if you
admit that I'm your girlfriend.\\
219 - No, the price is too high.\\
220 - Okay, fine. You know what? I'm
telling everybody everything anyways.\\
221 - Starting with the fact that
you called me your girlfriend.\\
222 - You're blackmailing me?\\
223 - You're coming along nicely.\\
224 - Good news. I got the job.\\
225 - What the hell is that
on your finger?\\
226 - Oh, it's chocolate and coconut.\\
227 - I can't believe
you took my ring.\\
228 - Oh...\\
229 - Yes. I took it.\\
230 - I took it, and I'm proud.\\
231 - You don't deserve
something this beautiful.\\
232 - You have a girlfriend. You
have a ring. I have nothing!\\
233 - Well, you have a job.\\
234 - Well, that's true.
Good for me.\\
235 - You guys, look at this thing.
God, what was Donna thinking?\\
236 - Forman, you gotta expect this.
I mean, look at her dad.\\
237 - The apple doesn't fall far
from the Bob.\\
238 - Now, this ring's a wolf
attacking a zebra.\\
239 - This one's a zebra
attacking a wolf.\\
240 - And in this one,
they're finally friends.\\
241 - Hey, there. Hi, there.
Ho, there. Let's go.\\
242 - I'm not going to the game
with you in that jacket, Bob.\\
243 - I'm not going to the game, Bob.\\
244 - My God, she never had a chance.\\
245 - Hyde, my girlfriend
has bad taste.\\
246 - Well, she is dating you.\\
247 - Ah, a good burn, Fez.\\
248 - And that ring is only the
beginning, man. I can see it now.\\
249 - Eric, you look so foxy.\\
250 - Hey, there. Hi, there.
Ho, there.\\
251 - Ta-da!\\
252 - Look what I found. And I
didn't even lose it. Fez took it.\\
253 - So, basically, you got mad at
me for being a victim of robbery.\\
254 - Okay.\\
255 - Apologetic look accepted.\\
256 - Eric, I got mad at you for not being
honest, and that hasn't changed.\\
257 - Really?
I thought it might have.\\
258 - I gave you the ring as a symbol of
how far we've come in our relationship.\\
259 - And if you can't be honest, then you
shouldn't be wearing that ring at all.\\
260 - Okay. You want me
to be honest?\\
261 - Okay. I kind of think\\
262 - that you have bad taste.\\
263 - What? I do not!\\
264 - Okay. Well, then, tell me
what you think of this room.\\
265 - This turquoise-and-chrome
disaster of a room.\\
266 - I think it's classy
and sophisticated.\\
267 - You know, maybe you're the
one who has bad taste. In fact...\\
268 - Why don't you tell me about
this pea-soup-colored chair?\\
269 - I think it's comfortable and
soothing, just like pea soup.\\
270 - Well, I think this whole room
is a great example of bad taste.\\
271 - - Excuse me?
- Mrs. Forman.\\
272 - I have spent years picking
every item in this room\\
273 - so that I would be surrounded
by the things I love\\
274 - and the people
I thought loved me.\\
275 - Hey, Kitty, how about a nap?\\
276 - And you. Have you fixed
the damn clicker yet?\\
277 - What good is a clicker
if it won't click?\\
278 - Oh, my goodness. I am
flying right off the handle.\\
279 - Seems to me you're just
as pleasant as always.\\
280 - Ooh, that is sweet. Oh.\\
281 - I think I'd like to take
a nap now.\\
282 - Did you see that?\\
283 - I told you the truth,
and we got into a fight.\\
284 - My dad told my mom she's
pleasant, a whopper of a lie,\\
285 - and they've been
married 150 years.\\
286 - I don't care. I want you to
tell me the truth all the time.\\
287 - No. No, you don't.\\
288 - It's like when women ask\\
289 - whether or not their outfit
makes them look fat.\\
290 - How many men tell them
they look fat? Zero.\\
291 - How many women look fat?
Not zero.\\
292 - That is totally different.\\
293 - No, Donna. No, it isn't.\\
294 - Look, how could I look you in the
eye and tell you that I don't like the ring\\
295 - when I love you so much?\\
296 - I guess I know what you mean.\\
297 - It's like when you wrote me
that song.\\
298 - Wait. You love that song.\\
299 - Of course I do.\\
300 - You know what?
We are really bad with rings.\\
301 - Yeah. If we ever get married,
we should just exchange, like,\\
302 - buckets of chicken.\\
303 - Or I could write you
another song.\\
304 - - Oh. I'm fine with chicken.
- Okay.\\
305 - Does this outfit
make my butt look fat?\\
306 - No. You look super.\\
307 - So Wonder Boy and I\\
308 - are thinking
about moving in together.\\
309 - My parents are gonna freak!\\
310 - You think your parents
are gonna freak?\\
311 - Yeah, we're twins.\\
312 - You know,
it really hurts my feelings\\
313 - that you call me Dr. Bald.\\
314 - Just because I'm evil
doesn't mean I don't cry.\\
315 - Super jerks!
\subsection {Episode 06: Over the Hills and Far Away}
1 - Okay. So, is everyone ready\\
2 - for our big trip to the
University of Wisconsin?\\
3 - Yeah, Donna and I have
it all mapped out.\\
4 - She is going to buy
a tight sweater\\
5 - with a big red "W" on it, and I
am going to watch her wear it.\\
6 - And then we're gonna
buckle down.\\
7 - Oh, Steven, I put out some clean
clothes for you to take on the trip.\\
8 - Thanks, Mrs. Forman, but
I'm not really the college type.\\
9 - - I get my learning
on the street.
- Steven, you're a smart kid.\\
10 - If you would only just apply
yourself, you could go to college, too.\\
11 - You don't trust me alone
in the house, do you?\\
12 - See how smart you are?\\
13 - Well, I just can't believe my baby
is all grown up and visiting college.\\
14 - I am so freaking old!\\
15 - And menopause makes another\\
16 - unwelcome appearance
at the dinner table.\\
17 - No, no, it's not unwelcome,
it's liberating.\\
18 - It's... Now my emotions
just spill out.\\
19 - Yeah, Mom, you're sweating
all over your pork chop.\\
20 - Hey! There's my
favorite co-ed.\\
21 - Hey, you all packed
for Visitors Weekend?\\
22 - I can't go. My dad's making me
visit Marquette instead.\\
23 - He thinks it's a better school
'cause it's private.\\
24 - Oh, and 'cause it sounds French.\\
25 - Well, you know what?\\
26 - We'll just go with you. I
mean, if it's a better school,\\
27 - then I belong there, too.
Right, Dad?\\
28 - No.\\
29 - State schools are cheap.
That's where you belong.\\
30 - Well, what if, like, you took out a
second mortgage on the house?\\
31 - Not for you, dumb ass.\\
32 - Hanging out\\
33 - Down the street\\
34 - The same old thing\\
35 - We did last week\\
36 - Not a thing to do\\
37 - But talk to you\\
38 - We're all all right\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
41 - I have a bad feeling
about this weekend, Eric.\\
42 - Nothing good can come from
us visiting different schools.\\
43 - Well, yeah,
but there's an upside.\\
44 - Two days apart?
I mean, when we get together,\\
45 - it's gonna be electric, baby.\\
46 - Like a thunderstorm.\\
47 - Eric, I'm serious.\\
48 - I mean, what if we actually\\
49 - end up going
to different colleges?\\
50 - And we're apart for four years?\\
51 - Well, then, come semester break,\\
52 - you better board up
your windows,\\
53 - 'cause guess what?
Here comes Hurricane Eric.\\
54 - Board up my windows?
What are my windows?\\
55 - And whatever they are,
wouldn't you want them open?\\
56 - Mmm.\\
57 - Look, Donna, all I'm saying\\
58 - is that I think
we can get through anything.\\
59 - I mean, we go to different
schools now, and we're fine,\\
60 - because our love is strong,\\
61 - like a big, burly bear.\\
62 - So zip up your tent,
'cause guess what?\\
63 - This bear has claws.\\
64 - - Again, wouldn't you
want my tent open?
- Mmm.\\
65 - Hold it, you two.
Now, before we hit the road,\\
66 - we need to have a talk about that horrible
thing that's taken over your mother.\\
67 - You mean, her "change of life"?\\
68 - I thought we were calling it
"the lady-parts problem."\\
69 - It goes by many names.\\
70 - Now, we're dealing
with a tricky enemy here.\\
71 - I haven't been
this frosty since Korea.\\
72 - And just like a commie,\\
73 - it can jump out
and attack you at any moment.\\
74 - - Red, honey!
- Incoming!\\
75 - Retreat!\\
76 - Red, you know, I've
been a tad bit moody lately.\\
77 - So if you don't want me to go
on this trip, I'll understand.\\
78 - Well, you know, honey, there's
really no need for you to go.\\
79 - I knew you didn't want me to go!\\
80 - Well, I am going,
whether you like it or not.\\
81 - Why is it so damn hot in here?\\
82 - It's like... It's like
we're living in hell!\\
83 - You can say that again.\\
84 - So, Steven, when I go to
Marquette with Donna this weekend,\\
85 - there'll be lots
of cute boys around.\\
86 - Lucky you.\\
87 - Well, unlucky them, because
I won't let them kiss me.\\
88 - Yeah, that's my promise to you.\\
89 - Now, I'm not saying you
have to promise me anything,\\
90 - but if you want to,
now would be a good time.\\
91 - Okay, well, just know\\
92 - that I won't be kissing anyone.\\
93 - Good to know.\\
94 - "Good to know"?
What, that's it?\\
95 - Did I stutter?\\
96 - Ah, thanks for the help.\\
97 - You seem to have a natural
talent for handling luggage.\\
98 - Red, honey. You know,
I'm sorry about our little spat.\\
99 - - The last thing
I wanna do is ruin our trip.
- Oh, sweetheart, that's okay.\\
100 - - Wow, Mom's certainly
cheered up.
- Don't be fooled.\\
101 - She's a ticking time bomb.\\
102 - Hey! Wait up!\\
103 - What do you want?\\
104 - The explanation is pinned
to my lapel.\\
105 - "Dear Red, Mr. Kelso and I are
unable to take Michael to UW.\\
106 - "Here's $30
so he can go with you."\\
107 - Where's the 30 bucks?\\
108 - Oh, I bought this
electronical football game.\\
109 - I swear to God, Kelso,\\
110 - you make Eric
look like Einstein.\\
111 - Thank you, Daddy.\\
112 - "Thank you"?
Einstein was ugly.\\
113 - Oh! It's like a sauna in here.\\
114 - Wish you didn't all
have to breathe so much.\\
115 - All right, guys,
you heard the lady.\\
116 - No more breathing.\\
117 - No, I didn't tell you
not to breathe,\\
118 - I asked you
not to breathe as much.\\
119 - There's a difference!\\
120 - To crazy people.\\
121 - Hey, Ali Baba, close sesame.\\
122 - - Oh, Red,
you just missed the exit.
- Oh, damn it!\\
123 - Eric, you're supposed to be
following the map.\\
124 - What the hell are you
doing back there?\\
125 - Making you a crown,\\
126 - 'cause you're king of the road!\\
127 - - I need to use the bathroom.
- Hey, can you turn up
the radio?\\
128 - - First and goal!
- How much further?\\
129 - Touchdown!\\
130 - Would you all just shut up!\\
131 - This is stupid.\\
132 - I mean, why am I looking at a
school I don't even wanna go to?\\
133 - I should've gone
to UW with Eric.\\
134 - And I should've laughed
at his thunderstorm jokes.\\
135 - You know, I bet those sluts
at UW will laugh at them.\\
136 - Sluts!\\
137 - What, UW has sluts?\\
138 - Steven loves sluts.\\
139 - He's not gonna do anything,
he's with you now.\\
140 - Well, I don't know
if he is or not.\\
141 - I mean, look, last week,
he called me his girlfriend.\\
142 - And then this week, I couldn't
even trick him into promising me\\
143 - he wouldn't fool around
with someone else.\\
144 - And I was very
passive-aggressive.\\
145 - I believe that.\\
146 - Donna, I promised
to be faithful,\\
147 - and all he said was,
"Good to know."\\
148 - "Good to know," Donna!\\
149 - Oh, you know what? I am too
depressed to go to orientation with you.\\
150 - Steven crushed my spirit, and now
there's only one place I can turn to.\\
151 - Please, God, don't let it be me.\\
152 - No. The cheerleading
demonstration.\\
153 - I mean, at first,
when they yell,\\
154 - "We've got spirit,
how about you?"\\
155 - Well, of course,
I'll have to say, "No!"\\
156 - But show me a human pyramid\\
157 - and a really sharp
pom-pom waterfall,\\
158 - and I'll get it back.\\
159 - What the hell kind of
college is this?\\
160 - Barefoot hippies
playing Frisbee,\\
161 - barefoot hippies
singing songs to trees.\\
162 - Man, this place is awesome!\\
163 - Look, they even have
dirty cartoons on the wall.\\
164 - Kelso, those are
CPR instructions.\\
165 - Wow, I've done CPR a lot.\\
166 - Hi, I'm Ted, resident adviser.\\
167 - - Hi.
- Why don't you folks
have a look around,\\
168 - and I'll show the boys where
they're gonna be staying?\\
169 - - I don't know
about this place.
- I'll say.\\
170 - It's the middle of November,\\
171 - I don't see any
Thanksgiving decorations.\\
172 - Visitors Weekend is great.\\
173 - We always have a big dorm
party, tons of beer, tons of chicks.\\
174 - Hey, I just need one six-pack
and two chicks, and I'm good.\\
175 - Man, this place is great! It's
too bad Donna couldn't make it.\\
176 - Oh, my God,
would you look at that?\\
177 - We just saw college butt!\\
178 - On a girl!\\
179 - - Hold it. Girls live here, too?
- Yes, sir. We're co-ed.\\
180 - - All right!
- Oh, yes!\\
181 - That's it! You're staying
with us at the motel.\\
182 - Wait! Dad, wait.\\
183 - Think of what a valuable
experience this could be for me.\\
184 - I mean, this is my first step
into the real world.\\
185 - I'm your little bird, Dad.\\
186 - Give me wings to fly.\\
187 - Butch it up and get in the car.\\
188 - Excuse me.
This is your CPR coach.\\
189 - I'm gonna need to check
your lung capacities.\\
190 - That means their boobs.\\
191 - There's got to be at least one
all-male dormitory on this campus.\\
192 - Ha! Here it is.\\
193 - Right in between the chapel
and the School of Interior Design.\\
194 - Boys, I realize that\\
195 - I may have been
a little irrational today.\\
196 - - "A little"?
- Shut up!\\
197 - So, maybe now
is a good time for me\\
198 - to explain a few things to you
about menopause.\\
199 - And, lucky for you, I'm a nurse,
so I can use the proper terms, like\\
200 - "epithelial lining"
and "uterine wall."\\
201 - I'm hooked.\\
202 - Okay, so. Now.\\
203 - Say these soaps are my ovaries.\\
204 - Kill me now.\\
205 - Can't hear you, man,
I'm on a beach in Florida.\\
206 - Okay, about a month ago
they stopped producing...\\
207 - They stopped...\\
208 - Stopped producing...\\
209 - That's it!\\
210 - What is wrong with you? Were
you dropped on your head?\\
211 - Yes, I was!\\
212 - And up until now, everyone had
the good grace not to mention it.\\
213 - - Okay, boys, time to leave.
- Yes!\\
214 - Mrs. Forman, I'm sorry, I
washed my face with your ovaries.\\
215 - Get out.\\
216 - So that's a great beard.\\
217 - I've never made out
with a guy with a beard.\\
218 - Well, this could be
your lucky day.\\
219 - - You wanna go to my room?
- Absolutely.\\
220 - You know what? I can't.\\
221 - Okay, but if you
change your mind,\\
222 - a few of us girls
will be in the shower.\\
223 - I can go!\\
224 - My name is Fez!\\
225 - Don't pretend you don't see me!\\
226 - Man, what the hell
did I just do?\\
227 - I just turned down a sure
thing because of Jackie.\\
228 - And you don't know what
she's doing at Marquette.\\
229 - Or who.\\
230 - Man, she said she wouldn't
do anything.\\
231 - Yeah, but I bet if she did,
you'd cry because you love her.\\
232 - If you don't shut up, you're
gonna be the first person\\
233 - to touch his chin to his ass.\\
234 - Have you been spying on me?\\
235 - I see UW has a pretty good
CPR programme.\\
236 - It's gonna be my major.\\
237 - So, I told my girlfriend we
can go to separate schools.\\
238 - - I mean, people do that
all the time, right?
- Yeah.\\
239 - I mean, my boyfriend
goes to school in New York,\\
240 - and we've been together
for three years,\\
241 - - and we're in love
now more than ever.
- Of course you are.\\
242 - And I bet when you two
get together,\\
243 - it's like a thunderstorm, right?\\
244 - Hey, pretty lady.\\
245 - Hey, excuse me. Hello?\\
246 - - Didn't you just say
you had a boyfriend?
- Yeah, but he's not here.\\
247 - Did you just see that? I told Donna
we could go to different schools,\\
248 - and I was extremely
wrong, and...\\
249 - Man, if she doesn't hate
Marquette, we're screwed.\\
250 - Who cares, man? I just turned
down a half-drunk college girl.\\
251 - And I'm pretty sure
she knew how to do stuff.\\
252 - Eric? Is everything okay?\\
253 - Yeah, everything's fine. I just
wanted to see how you liked Marquette.\\
254 - And, can I just say, if that snooty
switchboard operator's attitude\\
255 - is any indication
of the Marquette experience,\\
256 - then I can only assume we're
crossing Marquette off the list right now.\\
257 - No, actually, it's great. Okay,
they have this English professor,\\
258 - he wears a beret and a corduroy
jacket, but he listens to Zeppelin!\\
259 - Yeah, well, UW has
a vending machine, so...\\
260 - - Donna, I love you.
- I love you, too. Bye.\\
261 - You gonna cry now, too?\\
262 - You know who had a
real family? The Waltons.\\
263 - We're just three strangers
sitting in a room!\\
264 - Donna loves it there.
I don't know what to do.\\
265 - There's nothing any of us
can do. We're all screwed.\\
266 - You think I like
being stuck here\\
267 - nursing my lunatic wife
back from the brink?\\
268 - Hell, no.\\
269 - But we can't control
what happens to us.\\
270 - Even if, by some stroke of luck,\\
271 - you actually hang on to Donna,\\
272 - eventually, she's gonna
turn into that.\\
273 - And then, a few years later,
you'll die.\\
274 - Okay. Well, thanks for
the bedtime story.\\
275 - Donna, I hate it here,
and I wanna go home.\\
276 - Wait, what's wrong?\\
277 - Was there a height requirement
for the cheerleading team?\\
278 - No, it was awful.\\
279 - And when the cheerleaders
were yelling, "Go, team, go,"\\
280 - all I was hearing
was Steven saying,\\
281 - "Good to know.
Good to know!"\\
282 - Jackie, your problem is,
is you're always trying\\
283 - to force people
into doing stuff.\\
284 - Oh! I do not, Donna. Now,
you feel sorry for me right now.\\
285 - You can't make someone
like Hyde do anything.\\
286 - You have to deal with him
the way he deals with you.\\
287 - Look, pretend you don't care what
he does, and he'll come around.\\
288 - Well, I guess it's worth a try.\\
289 - You know, being with a
real man is complicated.\\
290 - You are so lucky
you're with Eric.\\
291 - What?\\
292 - What a wonderful weekend!
We should go away more often!\\
293 - They gotta make a pill for this.\\
294 - Oh, Hyde, I've been
meaning to tell you.\\
295 - Hyde and Jackie,
sitting in a tree.\\
296 - They're in love
like two monkeys.\\
297 - Would you shut up, Fez?
That's not even how it goes.\\
298 - - Well, is it making you mad?
- Yes.\\
299 - Well, then, that's how it goes.\\
300 - - Hey.
- Hi.\\
301 - Look, Jackie, I know
you were worried before,\\
302 - so I just wanna let you know\\
303 - nothing happened
on my end this weekend.\\
304 - I'm not telling you that so
you'll tell me what you did.\\
305 - I just wanna let you know
what happened with me.\\
306 - That's my report to you.\\
307 - All right, good to know.\\
308 - "Good to know"?\\
309 - Did I stutter?\\
310 - - Hi.
- Okay.\\
311 - I know you love Marquette, and you
know what? I made my peace with that.\\
312 - So, if that means
that we're gonna go\\
313 - to separate schools
and drift apart,\\
314 - and make out
with guys named Ted, then...\\
315 - That's just the way
it's gonna have to be,\\
316 - because you're gonna
get menopause,\\
317 - and I'm gonna die, and we can't
control anything that happens to us!\\
318 - - I'm not going to Marquette.
- Well, then never mind.\\
319 - I mean, Eric,\\
320 - I loved it, and when
I was driving home,\\
321 - I was so excited
to tell you about it,\\
322 - and then the drive took forever.\\
323 - And I realized, that's how far
away I'd be from you all the time.\\
324 - And I don't want that.\\
325 - So, I'll just tell my dad
I wanna go to UW with you.\\
326 - Donna, you have no idea
how happy you just made me.\\
327 - Eric, this is
gonna be great!\\
328 - We're gonna
be together all the time.\\
329 - Oh...\\
330 - You're not gonna
get all clingy, right?\\
331 - Shut up.\\
332 - No, come on. I'm gonna be
a big college man.\\
333 - - Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna need my space.\\
334 - What do you want?\\
335 - Once again, the explanation
is pinned to my lapel.\\
336 - "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
please give Michael $30\\
337 - "for the game you threw out
the window and broke.\\
338 - "Signed, my parents."\\
339 - Well, you made her laugh.
That's worth 30 bucks.

BUYING NICE THINGS\\
106 - WILL MAKE SOMEBODY
LOVE THEM.\\
107 - IF YOU EVER READ
ANYTHING\\
108 - BESIDES WHAT DONNY OSMOND

CURLING OVER THE RING\\

USUALLY WORK FOR YOU?\\
149 - I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NEW HERE.\\
150 - I USED TO WORK
AT THE LINGERIE STORE.\\
151 - THEY FIRED ME.
AH, I SEE.\\

156 - THAT'S AN ENGAGEMENT RING.\\
157 - I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL, MAN.\\

159 - WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU TELL ME\\
160 - WHAT IT IS
YOU WANNA SAY?\\
161 - THAT I LOVE HER\\
162 - AND WE SHOULD BE
TOGETHER FOREVER.\\

179 - SO, FORMAN, YOU FINALLY
BROKE DOWN, HUH?\\
180 - WHAT'D YOU GET HER?\\
181 - EARRINGS?
A LITTLE BRACELET?\\
182 - NO, I GOT HER WAY MORE
THAN A PIECE OF JEWELRY.\\
183 - I GOT HER A GIFT
THAT REALLY SAYS SOMETHING...\\
184 - A DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.\\
185 - AS A JOKE?\\
186 - NO, YOU GUYS, I'M GONNA ASK
DONNA TO MARRY ME.\\
187 - AS A JOKE?\\
188 - THE STUPID HELMET?\\
189 - WHY DO I HAVE TO WEAR
THE STUPID HELMET?\\
190 - BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID!\\
191 - YOU CAN'T ASK DONNA TO
MARRY YOU, MAN!\\
192 - WHY NOT?
I MEAN, COME ON.\\
193 - WE ALREADY KNOW THAT WE'RE
GONNA BE TOGETHER FOREVER.\\
194 - NO, YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE TOGETHER FOREVER.\\
195 - REMEMBER HOW YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT SCREWING THINGS UP?\\
196 - THIS IS
YOUR BAY OF PIGS, MAN.\\
197 - YEAH, EVEN IN MY COUNTRY,
WE'RE NOT STUPID ENOUGH\\
198 - TO GET MARRIED
IN HIGH SCHOOL.\\
199 - AND WE EAT BUGS!\\
200 - FORMAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?\\
201 - YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
OKAY? I LOVE HER.\\
202 - I WAS DOWN AT THE STORE
AND I REALIZED,\\
203 - WHAT AM I WAITING FOR?
WE'RE HAPPY.\\
204 - YOU DON'T ENGAGED WHEN
YOU'RE HAPPY! WHAT'S THE POINT?\\
205 - YOU DO IT WHEN
YOUR BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL\\
206 - AND THERE'S NO WAY OUT,\\
207 - LIKE IF
THE GIRL'S PREGNANT.\\
208 - IT IS SETTLED THEN.\\
209 - ERIC WILL GET DONNA
PREGNANT.\\
210 - I WILL OVERSEE
THE PROCEEDINGS\\
211 - FOR VERIFICATION
PURPOSES.\\
212 - AH, BUT HE'S SO STUPID,
HOW DO WE KNOW HE CAN DO IT?\\
213 - JACKIE,
HELP ME OUT HERE.\\
214 - WELL, I THINK
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.\\
215 - WELL, THEN
YOU'RE CRAZY, TOO.\\
216 - LOOK, STEVEN, I AM
MY OWN WOMAN, OKAY?\\
217 - I AM ALLOWED TO HAVE
OPINIONS ABOUT JEWELRY!\\
218 - YOU PRESENT HATER!\\
219 - LISTEN, YOU GUYS,\\
220 - I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
A LOT, OKAY?\\
221 - DONNA'S WILLING TO COMMIT
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE TO ME.\\
222 - I WANT TO COMMIT, TOO.\\
223 - FORMAN, I SAY THIS
TO YOU AS A FRIEND\\
224 - THAT LIKES TO SEE YOU
GET HURT.\\
225 - IF YOU DON'T TAKE
THAT RING BACK RIGHT NOW,\\
226 - YOU ARE GOING TO END UP
IN A WORLD OF MISERY AND PAIN.\\
227 - HEY, I LOVE DONNA, OKAY?\\
228 - SO DID IT EVER OCCUR
TO ANY OF YOU\\
229 - THAT I'M READY FOR A WORLD
OF MISERY AND PAIN?\\
230 - THINK ABOUT THAT!\\
231 - WHO WANTS
THE LAST PIECE OF SALAMI?\\
232 - I'LL TAKE IT.\\
233 - WHO WANTS A SALAMI?\\
234 - I SAID I DO.\\
235 - THERE YOU GO, SCHOTZIE!\\
236 - I SAID I WANTED THAT.\\
237 - BUT HE WAS BEGGING,
RED.\\
238 - WE DON'T TURN DOWN
BEGGARS.\\
239 - DO WE, SCHOTZIE?
NO, WE DON'T!\\
240 - OKAY, YOU GUYS KNOW MORE
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS\\
241 - THAN MY MORON FRIENDS,\\
242 - SO I HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT ME AND DONNA.\\
243 - NO, NO MORE
ABOUT YOU AND DONNA.\\
244 - YOU NEED TO BE THINKING
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE...\\
245 - COLLEGE, GETTING OUT
OF MY HOUSE.\\
246 - BUT DONNA IS MY FUTURE.\\
247 - HONEY, WE KNOW YOU
LOVE DONNA,\\
248 - BUT YOU TWO ARE SO
ON AGAIN AND OFF AGAIN,\\
249 - YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE
OFF AGAIN SOMETIME SOON.\\
250 - WON'T THEY, SCHOTZIE?
YES, THEY WILL!\\
251 - HOW ABOUT A CAREER?
HAVE YOU EVEN GIVEN THOUGHT\\
252 - TO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WITH YOUR LIFE?\\
253 - YES, DONNA AND I...\\
254 - I THINK HE SHOULD BE
A PHARMACIST.\\
255 - NOW THERE'S AN IDEA.\\
256 - YOU CAN COUNT.\\
257 - THERE'S NO HEAVY LIFTING.\\
258 - YOU OUGHT TO SEE HIM
TRY TO WRESTLE\\
259 - WITH THAT BIG MOP
DOWN AT THE STORE.\\
260 - I DON'T SEE WHAT ANY OF THIS
HAS TO DO WITH ME AND DONNA.\\
261 - OH, HONEY, BUT YOU WOULD BE
SUCH A GOOD PHARMACIST.\\
262 - YOUR SLENDER FINGERS
ARE PERFECT\\
263 - FOR PICKING UP TINY PILLS.\\
264 - AREN'T THEY, SCHOTZIE?
YES, THEY ARE!\\
265 - DID YOU SEE THAT?
HE JUST NODDED.\\
266 - BLUE MORNING, BLUE DAY...\\
267 - MAN, EVERYONE'S DOWN ON
ME AND DONNA GETTING ENGAGED.\\
268 - YOU GUYS, MY PARENTS...\\
269 - EVEN THE MAGIC 8-BALL SAID,
"OUTLOOK NOT SO GOOD."\\
270 - I JUST...\\
271 - I REALLY THINK DONNA
WOULD LOVE AN ENGAGEMENT RING.\\
272 - OH, SHE'LL LOVE THE RING.\\
273 - IT'S THE THOUGHT BEHIND IT\\
274 - THAT WILL SEND HER
RUNNING FOR THE HILLS.\\
275 - OR MAYBE SHE'LL SEE
HOW SMART IT IS\\
276 - TO GET MARRIED WHEN
YOU'RE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL\\
277 - AND HAVE NO MONEY
OR FUTURE.\\
278 - I KNOW I RAN WHEN JACKIE
WANTED TO MARRY ME,\\
279 - EXCEPT I RAN FOR CALIFORNIA
INSTEAD OF THE HILLS.\\
280 - I MEAN, THE BEACH KICKS
THE HILLS' ASS!\\
281 - THERE'S WAY MORE BIKINIS,\\
282 - AND THEY USUALLY HAVE
A SNACK BAR!\\
283 - WHAT IF YOU GUYS
ARE RIGHT?\\
284 - WHAT IF SHE THINKS
I'M MOVING TOO FAST?\\
285 - MAN, GIVING HER THIS RING
IS A HUGE GAMBLE.\\
286 - AM I MAN ENOUGH
TO MAKE THAT BET?\\
287 - NO, NO!
THE ANSWER IS NO!\\
288 - YOU SEE, FORMAN, YOU TRIED
TO DO A NICE, THOUGHTFUL THING,\\
289 - AND YOU SCREWED YOURSELF.\\
290 - IT'S ALL ABOUT
EXPECTATIONS, MAN.\\
291 - LIKE I'VE TAUGHT JACKIE TO THINK
I'M RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE.\\
292 - I CAN'T DISAPPOINT HER,\\
293 - BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS
DISAPPOINTING HER!\\
294 - THEN IF I DON'T GIVE DONNA
THE RING\\
295 - WHAT AM I GONNA DO AT
THE WATER TOWER?\\
296 - OH, GOD!\\
297 - I DO DESERVE THIS!\\
298 - DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK
THAT SCHOTZIE LOOKS LIKE FEZ?\\
299 - THAT DOG IS FLYIN'!\\
300 - I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO SCHOTZIE.\\
301 - HE'S SO HUNGRY, HE WENT
THROUGH THREE CANS OF FOOD.\\
302 - DIDN'T YOU, SCHOTZIE?\\
303 - YES, YOU DID!\\
304 - HEY, BOB, HAND ME THAT
REMOTE THERE, WILL YOU?\\
305 - NO THANKS, RED.\\
306 - I'D HAVE TO BUCKLE
MY BELT.\\
307 - WELL, BUCKLE
YOUR BELT ANYWAY.\\
308 - NO ONE WANTS
TO SEE THAT.\\
309 - OH, NOT AGAIN!\\
310 - THERE WE GO.\\
311 - WHAT THE HELL!\\
312 - OH, CRAP!\\
313 - THAT'S IT!
THAT DAMN DOG'S GOTTA GO.\\
314 - I THINK HE JUST WENT,
RED.\\
315 - ARE YOU LAUGHING, BOB?\\
316 - YOUR BOTTOM'S ALL WET.\\
317 - THAT'S JUST PLAIN FUNNY
IN MY BOOK.\\
318 - WELL, HE CAN'T STAY.
HE'S MAKING EVERYONE MISERABLE.\\
319 - I DON'T KNOW.\\
320 - KITTY'S SEEMED PRETTY DARN
HAPPY THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.\\
321 - YEAH, WELL...\\
322 - LOOK, RED,
YOU DID A NICE THING.\\
323 - DON'T SPOIL IT BY,
YOU KNOW, BEING YOURSELF.\\
324 - I GUESS IF THE INCONTINENT
LITTLE BASTARD\\
325 - MAKES KITTY HAPPY,
I'LL PUT UP WITH IT.\\
326 - WHAT THE HELL? I'VE NEVER
BEEN THAT HAPPY ANYWAY.\\
327 - AT LEAST NOT
SINCE I'VE KNOWN YOU.\\
328 - YEAH.
WEIRD COINCIDENCE, HUH?\\
329 - OKAY, LOOK, YOU!\\
330 - I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
ALL YOUR CONSPIRACY MUMBO JUMBO\\
331 - ABOUT PRESENTS AND DIAMONDS
AND BUYING ME STUFF.\\
332 - AND I REALIZED THAT\\
333 - ALL YOUR PARANOID,
DELUSIONAL CRAP ABOUT ROMANCE\\
334 - IS A JUST A COVER-UP
FOR YOU BEING CHEAP!\\
335 - OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT
PARANOID, DELUSIONAL CRAP!\\
336 - ADVERTISERS SPEND BILLIONS
TO MAKE YOU THINK\\
337 - I'M A JERK IF I DON'T
BUY YOU JEWELRY.\\
338 - AND SECOND OF ALL...\\
339 - YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM CHEAP.\\
340 - WELL, YOU'D BETTER
QUIT IT,\\
341 - BECAUSE I LIKE
TO GET STUFF,\\
342 - ESPECIALLY SHINY STUFF.\\
343 - WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR
A CHEESEBURGER\\
344 - WRAPPED IN TINFOIL?\\
345 - WELL, FOR YOU I WILL,\\
346 - BUT JUST KNOW THAT I'M
REALLY LOWERING MY STANDARDS.\\
347 - THAT MAKES TWO OF US.\\
348 - SO? HUH?\\
349 - THIS IS ROMANTIC, HUH?\\
350 - IT'S A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC
IN THE SUMMER.\\
351 - OR ANY TIME
NOT BELOW FREEZING.\\
352 - SO WHAT AM I GETTING?\\
353 - WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?\\
354 - WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?\\
355 - THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING.\\
356 - A CANDY BAR?\\
357 - WELL, HALF A CANDY BAR.\\
358 - I FIGURED WE COULD SHARE IT
UNDER THE STARS.\\
359 - WHAT A DELIGHTFUL
MOONLIT SNACK.\\
360 - OKAY, YOU'RE BEING WEIRD,
AND IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.\\
361 - OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT COLD.\\
362 - AW...\\
363 - ERIC, WHY ARE
WE UP HERE?\\
364 - OKAY, I'M SORRY, DONNA.\\
365 - I HAD SOMETHING
THAT I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU,\\
366 - BUT I REALIZED
IT WAS STUPID.\\
367 - OR EVERYONE SAID IT WAS STUPID,
SO I JUST DECIDED AGAINST IT.\\
368 - WHAT WAS IT?\\
369 - IT WAS NOTHING.\\
370 - WELL, IT WAS SOMETHING.\\
371 - I MEAN, I CAN SEE THAT
IT WAS SOMETHING.\\
372 - JUST TELL ME.\\
373 - OKAY, FINE.\\
374 - I WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU THIS.\\
375 - OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT A...?\\
376 - YEAH.\\
377 - IT'S STUPID, RIGHT?\\
378 - YEAH.\\
379 - AND... NO.\\
380 - I DON'T KNOW.\\
381 - WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE DONE WITH IT?\\
382 - WELL, I DON'T KNOW.\\
383 - I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE\\
384 - AND THAT...\\
385 - YOU MEAN EVERYTHING
TO ME.\\
386 - AND THEN...\\
387 - I WOULD HAVE
GONE DOWN ON ONE KNEE.\\
388 - YOU KNOW, LIKE THIS.\\
389 - AND THEN I WOULD HAVE
TAKEN YOUR HAND,\\
390 - AND TAKEN THE RING...\\
391 - GO AHEAD.\\
392 - AND I WOULD HAVE PUT
THE RING ON YOUR FINGER,\\
393 - LIKE THIS.\\
394 - WOW.\\
395 - SO, UH...\\
396 - SO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.\\
397 - WHY DON'T I JUST
HOLD ON TO THAT\\
398 - UNTIL, YOU KNOW,
THE REAL MOMENT COMES.\\
399 - WELL, SURE.\\
400 - OR I COULD HOLD ON
TO IT.\\
401 - YOU COULD?\\
402 - YEAH.\\
403 - ERIC, I LOVE YOU,\\
404 - AND I WANT TO BE
WITH YOU FOREVER.\\
405 - YES.\\
406 - THAT'S WHAT I TOLD
EVERYONE,\\
407 - AND THEY MADE ME
WEAR THE STUPID HELMET.\\
408 - SO, UM...\\
409 - DID WE JUST GET...\\
410 - I THINK WE DID.\\
411 - DONNA, I LOVE YOU.\\
412 - WE ARE SO STUPID!\\
413 - I KNOW, RIGHT?!\\
414 - j&j&\\
415 - OH, HERE COMES
YOUR DAD.\\
416 - PUT THE RING IN YOUR POCKET.
WHY? HE'LL BE HAPPY FOR US.\\
417 - OH, YEAH?\\
418 - HEY, MR. PINCIOTTI.\\
419 - WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF I, SAY,\\
420 - MADE A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT
TO YOUR DAUGHTER?\\
421 - OH, I'D KILL YA.\\
422 - YOU KNOW WHAT,
A SECRET ENGAGEMENT\\
423 - IS EVEN MORE ROMANTIC.\\
424 - AND MORE STUPID!
\subsection {Episode 08: Thank You}
1 - I love this ring.\\
2 - You know, I wish we could
tell people that we're engaged.\\
3 - You know,
without Red killing you.\\
4 - Red kills happy things,
it's what he does.\\
5 - Let's just enjoy the fact that someday
you are going to be Mrs. Forman.\\
6 - Mrs. Forman? You want me
to go by Mrs. Forman?\\
7 - Well, yeah, I just assumed.
I mean, come on.\\
8 - Pinciotti?\\
9 - Which is nice.
No, which is really nice.\\
10 - Eric?\\
11 - Eric? Honey, could you get the
Thanksgiving turkey out of the freezer?\\
12 - Oh, wait.
It's a 20-pounder. Donna.\\
13 - Could you get the Thanksgiving
turkey out of the freezer?\\
14 - Sure, Mrs. Forman.\\
15 - See? There's your Mrs. Forman.\\
16 - Okay. Yeah, you know,
you're right.\\
17 - That's gonna be a little creepy.\\
18 - Well, now I kind of like it.
Call me Mrs. Forman.\\
19 - No.\\
20 - - Mrs. Forman's feeling dirty.
- No, okay, Donna...\\
21 - Come on. Give Mrs.
Forman a big French kiss!\\
22 - No! Donna, no!\\
23 - Hanging out\\
24 - Down the street\\
25 - The same old thing\\
26 - We did last week\\
27 - Not a thing to do\\
28 - But talk to you\\
29 - We're all all right\\
30 - We're all all right\\
31 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
32 - Okay. Perfect.
We're all set for turkey day.\\
33 - And there'll be plenty of
room, especially without Laurie.\\
34 - Has anyone heard from her?
Of course not!\\
35 - I guess respect and courtesy
aren't genetic like my slim hips.\\
36 - Hey, Schotzie, stay away
from my witch sister.\\
37 - Her and her witch friends have
been known to sacrifice small animals.\\
38 - Oh, and possibly that
one asthmatic neighbor boy.\\
39 - Eric, little Wally moved away.\\
40 - A six-year-old moved away?\\
41 - His parents still
live in that house.\\
42 - Mrs. Forman, if it helps, I can
invite Jackie to Thanksgiving.\\
43 - She's bitchy like Laurie.\\
44 - Ms. Forman, I would love\\
45 - to come to your
Thanksgiving dinner,\\
46 - and I'll bring a date
and a 12-pack,\\
47 - just like the pilgrims.\\
48 - Hey, guys, Red is gonna flip
when he sees this failing notice.\\
49 - "To the parent or guardian
of Eric Forman."\\
50 - "Your son is a complete idiot.\\
51 - "Please kick him out, and raise
the foreign boy as your own."\\
52 - Man, all I did was mess up
on two math quizzes,\\
53 - but Ms. McGee has to be all...\\
54 - "I'm Ms. McGee.\\
55 - "I wear high heels
and fail everybody."\\
56 - What's that?\\
57 - That's Ms. McGee.\\
58 - You hardly changed your voice.\\
59 - Well, sure, I did.\\
60 - - I'm Ms. McGee. I...
- That's just your voice.\\
61 - I'm doing an impression.\\
62 - Well, you suck at impressions.\\
63 - - Okay, forget it.
- Are you still doing her?\\
64 - Oh, hey, Red, do me a favor.
Sign this, huh?\\
65 - My gym teacher's failing me
'cause I won't wear shorts.\\
66 - - Why won't you wear shorts?
- Would you wear shorts?\\
67 - Fine.\\
68 - Thank you.\\
69 - So, Eric,
how's school treating you?\\
70 - You managing to keep
from embarrassing yourself?\\
71 - Yeah. Oh, sure. I've been
buckling down, just like you said,\\
72 - and thinking a little bit more
about my future,\\
73 - which I believe
you also recommended.\\
74 - Well, it's good to know\\
75 - that 17 years of kicking
your ass has finally paid off.\\
76 - Eric, you didn't have him
sign your failing notice.\\
77 - Oh, I don't wanna trouble him
with this old thing.\\
78 - I'll just sign his name myself,\\
79 - because that's
how good a son I am.\\
80 - Baby, baby, baby, baby, ohh\\
81 - Okay, careful.
Careful. Watch the TV. Okay.\\
82 - Okay, this is good.
Perfect. Perfect.\\
83 - You. Why are you here?\\
84 - You don't even know
what Thanksgiving is.\\
85 - I'm here because my host
parents are feeding bums at church.\\
86 - Charity begins at home, my ass.\\
87 - - Laurie?
- Hey, little brother.\\
88 - You're back.\\
89 - And you're not even
eight months pregnant.\\
90 - - Mommy!
- Laurie!\\
91 - Oh, my goodness!
I knew you'd come.\\
92 - - Hi, Daddy!
- All the phones
broken in Chicago?\\
93 - No. Well, see, I had
other plans, but my date...\\
94 - I mean, business associate,
had to go be with his wife.\\
95 - I mean,
other business associate.\\
96 - I'm doing good!\\
97 - Okay, well, you know what?\\
98 - I'm gonna set you a place
right next to me at the big table.\\
99 - No, Kitty. I think
that seat belongs to Eric.\\
100 - Me? At the adults' table?\\
101 - Are you sure I'm ready?\\
102 - - But, Daddy...
- Maybe, before you leave,\\
103 - you'll be acting
a little more like him.\\
104 - Yeah!\\
105 - I'm the favorite now. Ooh!\\
106 - Taste that.\\
107 - Pimp gave you
the holiday off, huh?\\
108 - Yeah. He replaced me
with your mom.\\
109 - Now it's Thanksgiving.\\
110 - Hey, Donna.\\
111 - You know how my dad's so proud of
me for doing so well in school, and all?\\
112 - Even though it's a lie,
and you're failing math\\
113 - 'cause you spend
all your time with me?\\
114 - Yeah. Right. That's right.\\
115 - Well, just now, right now,
right in there, right now,\\
116 - Red asked me
to sit at the grownups' table.\\
117 - Wow!\\
118 - I hear each person over there
gets their own biscuit.\\
119 - Yeah. Donna, it's glorious.\\
120 - Donna.\\
121 - Donna, I want to tell everyone
we're engaged. Tonight.\\
122 - Tonight? Are you sure?\\
123 - Yeah, I just...\\
124 - I just want everyone
to know, you know?\\
125 - So, when the moment's right,
we'll just... We'll tell them all.\\
126 - This is so awesome!\\
127 - And then, just in case,
we'll run like hell.\\
128 - - I probably
won't wait for you.
- Oh, okay.\\
129 - Yeah.\\
130 - That's a beautiful table, Kitty.\\
131 - Well, thank you, Daddy. So glad
that you and Mom could be here.\\
132 - Well, we have to eat somewhere.\\
133 - And, Mom, I know that
we have had our ups and downs,\\
134 - but in honor
of this special day,\\
135 - I would like to tell you
that I am thankful\\
136 - that you are my mother,
and I love you.\\
137 - Isn't there something
you would like to tell me?\\
138 - Actually, I would like
some more tea.\\
139 - I'll try and slip
some booze in there,\\
140 - in the interest
of a happy holiday.\\
141 - So, Thanksgiving.\\
142 - We celebrate the subjugation
of an indigenous people\\
143 - with yams and Underdog floats.\\
144 - Yeah, I'm mostly celebrating
my pretty new dress.\\
145 - And so much for talking.\\
146 - May I wet your whistle, Grandpa?\\
147 - Gonna have to say yes to that.\\
148 - Well, cannot let this
go to waste.\\
149 - When did they get a houseboy?\\
150 - Happy Thanksgiving,
Ms. Forman.\\
151 - This is my date, Carol.\\
152 - Ms. McGee?\\
153 - Kelso,\\
154 - you're dating my math teacher?\\
155 - No. No, no, no.
We're not dating.\\
156 - We just have a relationship that I
thought we agreed to keep a secret?\\
157 - Well, welcome.\\
158 - Michael, she is
10 years older than you.\\
159 - Oh, no.
Nine and five-twelfths.\\
160 - She taught me that.\\
161 - - Very good, Michael.
- Thank you.\\
162 - Okay.\\
163 - Kelso, how could you bring her?\\
164 - Oh, relax, man. She's not
gonna quiz you or anything.\\
165 - But if she does, the
square root of zero is zero.\\
166 - She got me with that last night,\\
167 - earned herself a free massage.\\
168 - Ms. McGee, being that
it's a holiday and all,\\
169 - there are certain math-related,\\
170 - failing-type things
I'd rather not talk about.\\
171 - I hear you. There are certain
things I'd like to keep quiet, too.\\
172 - So, if anyone from
the school board should ask,\\
173 - I came alone,
and I left before dessert.\\
174 - Eric, maybe we should wait
on the big announcement,\\
175 - now that your
math teacher is here.\\
176 - Oh, no, Donna,
we don't have to worry,\\
177 - 'cause she's not
my math teacher today.\\
178 - Today,
she's a cradle-robbing slut.\\
179 - - Yay, student-teacher
relationships!
- Yay!\\
180 - Hey, Laurie.
Long time no doing it.\\
181 - Maybe for you.\\
182 - So, what time is your date
gonna let you out for recess?\\
183 - Nice try, Laurie. There's no
recess today, it's Thanksgiving!\\
184 - Wow, Laurie.\\
185 - Yeah, me and her
really had something, huh?\\
186 - Yeah. Ointment took care
of that, though, right?\\
187 - Yeah.\\
188 - This looks great.\\
189 - Here you go. One for Burt,
and one for Ernie.\\
190 - I'm calling you Ernie now,
because you look like the Muppet.\\
191 - I didn't ask for a drink.\\
192 - Well, I didn't ask
to be born in a field.\\
193 - But you fought back
against adversity,\\
194 - just like your Indian brothers.\\
195 - What is he, Cherokee?\\
196 - Gobble, gobble, gobble.\\
197 - It's time to carve the turkey.\\
198 - - Red.
- Actually, Kitty,
I think this is Eric's year.\\
199 - Seems like he's growing up
and finally buckling down.\\
200 - Here you go, Son.\\
201 - Wow.\\
202 - Okay.\\
203 - Well, in that case, I would like
to make a kind of announcement.\\
204 - - Check it out! I'm bread man.
- Hey, shut up! Eric's talking.\\
205 - Go ahead, honey.\\
206 - Okay.\\
207 - Well, I'm really glad that my
family is here, and my friends,\\
208 - and, well, even my math teacher,\\
209 - because something happened
a few days ago\\
210 - that I'd like to share
with everyone.\\
211 - Eric, we agreed
this isn't the time.\\
212 - - No. No, I meant...
- Not the time for what?\\
213 - To talk about
how he's failing math.\\
214 - - What?
- Fez, what the hell?\\
215 - I've been drinking.\\
216 - Mr. Forman, you did
sign the failing notice.\\
217 - I didn't sign...\\
218 - You forged my name?\\
219 - Wow. I really picked the
right day to come home, huh?\\
220 - Okay, um...\\
221 - Who likes dark meat?\\
222 - Hey, who doesn't?
Am I right, ladies?\\
223 - Oh, Lord.\\
224 - So, you lied to me about school.\\
225 - Now, it wasn't a lie so much
as a misdirection, really.\\
226 - We'll talk about this later.\\
227 - Well, Laurie, looks like
a seat just opened up for you.\\
228 - Come on over and grab a biscuit.\\
229 - Forty-two minutes
and I'm back on top.\\
230 - So, that was kind of a mess.\\
231 - Oh, no, that's what
I wanted to happen.\\
232 - Burt, honey, pass me your plate.\\
233 - Burtikins.\\
234 - - Burt!
- I'm up.\\
235 - Bob, you know what
Eric's problem is?\\
236 - All that time he's spending
with your daughter.\\
237 - Hey, Donna ain't the problem.\\
238 - Eric's the one who corrupted her up so
dirty, I had to send her to Catholic school.\\
239 - How could he be failing math?\\
240 - Kitty, I'm sure
he did the best he could\\
241 - for someone who was
held too long as a baby.\\
242 - I bet that explains why
he hit puberty so late, too.\\
243 - No, that was because
of your mother's smoking.\\
244 - Fez, I know you've only spoken
English for a couple weeks now,\\
245 - but could you have learnt
the words, "Don't tell my dad"?\\
246 - "Don't," a contraction
meaning "Do not,"\\
247 - and "Tell my dad,"
meaning "Shut up!"\\
248 - Okay, right there, you
just told me not to shut up.\\
249 - It's a wonder you're not
failing English, too.\\
250 - Crack a book,
you lazy son of a bitch.\\
251 - So, guys,\\
252 - Ms. McGee.\\
253 - Pretty nice, huh? If they put
one of her in every classroom,\\
254 - I'd never skip school again,
if you know what I mean.\\
255 - I mean, I'm doing it
with my teacher!\\
256 - Oh, shh!
But it's a secret, so...\\
257 - I've never been with a teacher,\\
258 - but I was with the post-office
lady. That was cool.\\
259 - I got 100 free stamps
and a monster roll of tape.\\
260 - I like older women, they always
got something smart to say.\\
261 - I think I could probably
fit inside of a record player.\\
262 - That's gotta sound good in
there. Inside of a record player?\\
263 - I miss dating Kelso.\\
264 - The guys I'm with now, they're
so... I don't know. What's the word?\\
265 - Married.\\
266 - Hey, you and Kelso didn't date.\\
267 - You're just a tramp
he cheated with.\\
268 - And, you contaminated him so
much, I ended up with Steven,\\
269 - who I love being with!\\
270 - So, thank you.\\
271 - Wow. I'm the only one here
who's never been with Kelso,\\
272 - which makes me wanna say, ew!\\
273 - And also, thank God.\\
274 - But you,
I mean, you're a teacher.\\
275 - Can't you get in trouble
for dating a student?\\
276 - Hey, let them come and get me.\\
277 - He's 18.
I make $11,000 a year.\\
278 - I deserve a little something.\\
279 - So, that was one rooting-tooting,
big old crap of a day, huh?\\
280 - Yep. Pretty much.\\
281 - I just really wanted to tell
people that we were engaged.\\
282 - You know what?
Maybe it'd be easier\\
283 - if we just showed up
next Thanksgiving with a kid.\\
284 - Hey, thanks for dinner, Kitty.\\
285 - I'll remember to wear
my stretch pants next time.\\
286 - Oh, let me know
if you find that button.\\
287 - Good night. I apologize
if my being here upset you.\\
288 - No, no, no. I just feel you
being seen out with a student is...\\
289 - It's just awfully bad principle.\\
290 - Oh, he doesn't care,
he's dating a cheerleader.\\
291 - Burt. Burtie Bear.\\
292 - - Burt!
- Grandma, let me.\\
293 - - Grandpa!
- I'm up!\\
294 - My goodness, you are going to
make some lucky man a wonderful wife.\\
295 - Oh, my God.\\
296 - That's where Laurie
gets her mean streak.\\
297 - It's not from delightful me,
it's from my evil mother!\\
298 - So, evil skips a generation.\\
299 - So, that means that my
granddaughter is gonna be the devil.\\
300 - Well, don't worry, because no
woman's gonna wanna bear your idiot kids\\
301 - if you can't even pass math.\\
302 - How could you
forge my signature?\\
303 - - Here comes yelling.
- Yeah, I don't
wanna hear this.\\
304 - - I'll help with the dishes.
- Yeah.\\
305 - And I'll take these
half-empty glasses.\\
306 - Okay. No, no.
You've had enough.\\
307 - Eric,\\
308 - what the hell is wrong with you?\\
309 - He doesn't understand
consequences, Daddy.\\
310 - Well, maybe
he'll understand this.\\
311 - From now on,
every time you disobey me,\\
312 - or lie to me, or do
anything that pisses me off,\\
313 - you're gonna pay me money.\\
314 - Pay you?
Wait, you're fining me?\\
315 - It's like giving him
tickets for being dumb.\\
316 - Okay, okay, I think we're forgetting
about a time-tested punishment here.\\
317 - There's your foot, here's
my ass. Swing away!\\
318 - Well, it obviously doesn't
work. So, for forging my name,\\
319 - you owe me 30 bucks.\\
320 - Daddy, can I borrow $30?\\
321 - - Sure, kitten.
- What...\\
322 - Laurie, your grandparents
are sleeping in your room,\\
323 - so you take Eric's room, and
the math whiz can ride the couch.\\
324 - Well, another
Thanksgiving come and gone.\\
325 - Certainly an eventful day, hmm?\\
326 - Yeah.\\
327 - What with our ungrateful
daughter, that dumb ass son,\\
328 - and a drunk foreign kid,
I'd say...\\
329 - Actually, it was a little
better than last year.\\
330 - - I know we're young.
- But we're totally in love.\\
331 - And we just want you to know...\\
332 - We're engaged!\\
333 - - Feels good to tell someone.
- Yeah.\\
334 - I think they're happy for us.\\
335 - Look, Schotzie's celebrating.
\subsection {Episode 09: Black Dog}
1 - Steven, I'm telling you,
beards are out.\\
2 - Look at Malibu Barbie.\\
3 - She can date anyone she wants.\\
4 - But she's with Malibu Ken.
Why?\\
5 - Because Malibu Ken
doesn't have a beard!\\
6 - Yes, he does.
Malibu Barbie's his beard.\\
7 - No straight man
wears shorts that tight.\\
8 - I don't care.
Just shave it off.\\
9 - It's like making out
with carpet.\\
10 - Well, here it is, the beginning
of the end for you two.\\
11 - Yeah, I remember
the part of our relationship\\
12 - when all Jackie did
was boss me around.\\
13 - Yeah, that part only
lasted, what, like, six years?\\
14 - And he's a better man for it.\\
15 - So come on, Steven,
let's shave that beard.\\
16 - Jackie, you just gave an order
in the form of a cheer.\\
17 - - Oh, where are you going?
- Wherever the beard takes me.\\
18 - Jackie, sweetie, we just got a
phone call, and you're needed at home.\\
19 - So why don't you grab your coat?\\
20 - Mr. Forman'll give you
a ride home.\\
21 - - Do you know what's going on?
- No, I don't know anything.\\
22 - I know everything!\\
23 - You know how Jackie's father is
a city councilman? Not anymore.\\
24 - He just got arrested for
bribery. He could go to prison.\\
25 - Well, I'm glad.\\
26 - That guy makes Republicans look like a
bunch of crooks and greedy businessmen.\\
27 - Yeah, well, thank God for the
honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh?\\
28 - Oh, no.\\
29 - What did you say?\\
30 - I said that\\
31 - Nixon was framed
and Kennedy was a commie.\\
32 - That's right.\\
33 - What's with the gun, Trigger?\\
34 - Oh, will you relax, Eric?
It's not a gun. It's a BB gun.\\
35 - Yeah. I lost it
when I was, like, 10,\\
36 - and I found it this morning
buried in my backyard.\\
37 - Why were you digging
in your backyard?\\
38 - Uh... Dinosaurs.\\
39 - Watch the news, Donna!\\
40 - You guys, I can't believe that Mr. Burkhart
might actually be going to prison.\\
41 - Ah, the tragedy.
My father was sent to prison,\\
42 - and it led to a life of
drugs and prostitution.\\
43 - - What?
- Yes. Then his pimp
killed him.\\
44 - But then the medical examiner
found a tiny hair.\\
45 - And he solved the crime, and he
sent the pimp bastard to the chair.\\
46 - Fez, that was last night's
episode of Quincy.\\
47 - Oh, I didn't know
you watch that show.\\
48 - Yeah, this is rough stuff
Jackie's going through.\\
49 - She'll come running to me,
Old Faithful.\\
50 - Kelso, Jackie's with me now.\\
51 - Maybe. But we have history.\\
52 - So when she needs
a shoulder to cry on,\\
53 - she'll rest her head
on these broad babies.\\
54 - Feel them.\\
55 - Rock hard, amigo.\\
56 - Man, you don't want Jackie
leaning on your shoulders.\\
57 - - They're all bruised.
- Where?\\
58 - Man, I should really see those
coming by now.\\
59 - Oh! Watch the gun,
Cool Hand Luke.\\
60 - Will you relax, Eric? God,
guns don't just go off by accident.\\
61 - Really? What about Eric's
fourth-grade hamster, Snowball?\\
62 - Oh, no, Snowball wasn't shot.\\
63 - He went upstate to live
with a nice farm family.\\
64 - You shot Snowball?\\
65 - The... The gun
went off by accident!\\
66 - Oh, sweet pea, I'm here for you.\\
67 - Steven, my dad's going to
prison. What am I gonna do?\\
68 - Bake him a cake
with a file in it?\\
69 - What do you want me to say?\\
70 - Nothing. Look,
I just... Oh, never mind.\\
71 - Now we're talking.
Donna, give her a kiss.\\
72 - Hanging out\\
73 - Down the street\\
74 - The same old thing\\
75 - We did last week\\
76 - Not a thing to do\\
77 - But talk to you\\
78 - We're all all right\\
79 - We're all all right\\
80 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
81 - Jackie blew right by me
to get to Hyde!\\
82 - Yes, I know.
Because you told me 20 times!\\
83 - Oh, there's my boss, Nina.\\
84 - Queen of the DMV.\\
85 - She haunts my dreams.\\
86 - Wait, I thought Mr. Roper from
Three's Company haunted your dreams.\\
87 - Oh, he's there, too.
Bug-eyed bastard.\\
88 - Look at how beautiful she is.\\
89 - You have to help me
win her heart.\\
90 - Whatever happened
to Jackie's heart?\\
91 - You know, at first I thought\\
92 - - they were just killing time.
- But Nina...\\
93 - But now I actually think
they're getting serious.\\
94 - - But Nina...
- I mean Jackie and Hyde, man?\\
95 - Enough!
It's over for you, pin-brain!\\
96 - Now, to summarize,\\
97 - Jackie gone, Nina still in play.\\
98 - Now help me do this thing.\\
99 - Fez.\\
100 - Nina. My queen-a.\\
101 - I told you I don't like that.\\
102 - Now you're late for your
fingerprint tutorial, so move it.\\
103 - Ooh, tough cookie.\\
104 - Yes, Fez likes
the hard-headed mamas.\\
105 - Really? I'm starting
to get into the Asian ladies.\\
106 - I know what you mean.
Mystery of the Orient. Very sexy.\\
107 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
108 - Donna, what are you doing
wearing the engagement ring?\\
109 - It's supposed to be a secret.\\
110 - You didn't tell anyone, did you?\\
111 - Yeah, Eric, I have no self-control,
so I told the pretzel guy at the park.\\
112 - Okay.\\
113 - Seriously, I have no self-control,
and I told the pretzel guy at the park.\\
114 - - Donna!
- I'm sorry.\\
115 - I'm excited.
I had to tell someone.\\
116 - Plus free pretzel.\\
117 - What's wrong, Steven?
Problems with Jackie?\\
118 - Yeah, I said the wrong thing.\\
119 - Well, I have menopause.
Do you have menopause?\\
120 - No.\\
121 - Lucky bastard.\\
122 - I'm sorry. So...\\
123 - Tell me what happened.\\
124 - Well,
she wanted me to say something\\
125 - to make her feel better and
I couldn't think of anything.\\
126 - Well, Steven, you don't know
how to comfort people,\\
127 - because you've
never been comforted.\\
128 - No, that's not true.\\
129 - One time, my dad felt so bad
about missing my Little League game\\
130 - that he made up for it by
disappearing for nine years.\\
131 - Well, after what
you've been through,\\
132 - you don't have to be
nice to anybody.\\
133 - Jackie can just leave you alone.\\
134 - Now I'm just... I'm gonna
go upstairs and cry a little.\\
135 - Problems with Jackie, huh?\\
136 - Hyde, I'd like to remind you that Donna
and I are basically the perfect couple.\\
137 - We really are.\\
138 - So we might just have
a little something\\
139 - to teach you
about relationships.\\
140 - We really do.\\
141 - - All you have to do
is back off.
- Go to her.\\
142 - What?\\
143 - No, he needs to be with her.\\
144 - No, he needs to give her space.\\
145 - When your mom left,
I gave you space.\\
146 - Yeah, but I didn't want space.
I wanted you with me.\\
147 - - You didn't tell me that.
- I couldn't find you!\\
148 - And they lived
happily ever after.\\
149 - Fingerprinting is one of the most
important jobs at the DMV, Fez.\\
150 - It helps make our customers
feel like common criminals.\\
151 - See? Firm but gentle.\\
152 - Repeat that. Firm but gentle.\\
153 - Fir but ge-ge.\\
154 - Your hands are strong.\\
155 - But your right hand's much
stronger than your left. Why is that?\\
156 - I am a sword fighter.\\
157 - - You fence?
- Touche.\\
158 - You know, I'm sorry if I'm a little
short-tempered with you sometimes.\\
159 - It's just, well,
when I see you, I just...\\
160 - No. No, I can't.\\
161 - But I am all atwitter.\\
162 - I'm sorry. I just can't. And
no one can know about this.\\
163 - But, Mom, Dad's in trouble.\\
164 - So I really think you need to
come back from Acapulco now.\\
165 - Uh-huh.\\
166 - Wow, that is a lot of tequila.\\
167 - Red, Jackie's been moping
in our kitchen for an hour.\\
168 - So call the cops.\\
169 - I don't want her arrested.
I want to help her.\\
170 - She needs a father figure.
Go talk to her.\\
171 - - No.
- Yes!\\
172 - - No.
- Red!\\
173 - Fine. Every damn argument!\\
174 - You'd think I'd win one,
just by chance.\\
175 - - Mr. Forman...
- Look, Jackie,\\
176 - I know that things seem grim,
but your father's rich, right?\\
177 - Uh-huh.\\
178 - Well, then I'm sure
that whatever trouble he's in,\\
179 - he'll buy his way
out and wriggle free.\\
180 - You're right.\\
181 - I mean, this is America. The
rich are treated differently here.\\
182 - Yep. And I'm so glad I took some
shrapnel to make that happen.\\
183 - Me, too.\\
184 - So, Hyde, have you
talked to Jackie yet?\\
185 - 'Cause don't... 'Cause you gotta
give her room to breathe, man.\\
186 - Yeah. And if she ever falls
out of a plane, just let her fall.\\
187 - What, he's supposed
to just jump out after her?\\
188 - Well, at least
they'll be together.\\
189 - Man, I don't get Jackie.\\
190 - I mean,
we were together for years,\\
191 - and the second I turn my back,
she off and frenches Hyde.\\
192 - And by "turn your back," you
mean ditching her for two months\\
193 - to have sex with
random beach trash?\\
194 - Whatever, man.\\
195 - You... It's all...
It's all about words with you!\\
196 - Kelso, Jackie's my girlfriend.\\
197 - We're together, so get over it.\\
198 - You know what? Fine!\\
199 - Dude, you shot him!\\
200 - That is exactly
what happened to Snowball!\\
201 - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,\\
202 - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.\\
203 - Did I shoot your eye?\\
204 - Yes! Now I can't see,
you moron! You're dead!\\
205 - - I'd start running now.
- Chasing me is futile!\\
206 - I'll just hide in
your blind spot!\\
207 - - Man, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.\\
208 - The BB just winged my shoulder.\\
209 - But that kid needs
to be taught a lesson.\\
210 - - Hyde, it was an accident.
- No, it wasn't.\\
211 - He's been bitching about me
and Jackie since he found out.\\
212 - Now he got himself so out
of control that he shot me.\\
213 - I don't like getting shot!\\
214 - So now I'm gonna punish him
the way my parents punish me.\\
215 - You're gonna
leave him at the mall?\\
216 - No. I'm gonna milk this eye thing
until he feels as bad as he should.\\
217 - They didn't leave me
at the mall. They forgot me.\\
218 - They were drunk.\\
219 - I am in pain.\\
220 - Fez, we're really sorry about
Nina. You know, rejection hurts.\\
221 - No, Nina and I were kissing,
and she made me stop\\
222 - and now I am in pain.\\
223 - I have to go do something.\\
224 - I think maybe we're all getting a
little too comfortable with each other.\\
225 - Well, maybe we wouldn't be so
comfortable if we just gave each other\\
226 - some space.\\
227 - Don't make me hit you.\\
228 - Well, good luck reaching me
through all the space.\\
229 - Hey, guys. Is Hyde here?\\
230 - Hyde?\\
231 - Hey, Hyde. I brought you this.\\
232 - What is it? I can't see.\\
233 - Well, it's most of a burger.\\
234 - I took a bite, 'cause I'm
sorry, but I'm also hungry.\\
235 - Yeah, well, it's almost 2:00.
I gotta go flush out my eye.\\
236 - You guys, how bad is it?
Is Hyde gonna be a Cyclops?\\
237 - Kelso, what were you thinking? I
mean, did you shoot him on purpose?\\
238 - No! The gun
went off on accident!\\
239 - Well, he kind of thinks you did.\\
240 - How could I? I mean, yeah,
I was mad. But I didn't...\\
241 - I don't know. Maybe I did it
accidentally on purpose.\\
242 - - You mean, subconsciously?
- No, I was definitely
awake the whole time.\\
243 - Steven, I'm glad
your eye's not hurt.\\
244 - Even though you deserve it because
you were such a jerk about my dad.\\
245 - Man, look, Jackie...\\
246 - I'm never gonna be the guy who says
the right thing at the right time. Okay?\\
247 - I'm just not.\\
248 - You are so full of it.\\
249 - All I'm asking for is a gesture,
and you can't even do that.\\
250 - Okay, I got something.\\
251 - Get your dad
a carton of cigarettes\\
252 - so he can trade them
for not being someone's wife.\\
253 - - Oh, just forget it.
- No. No.\\
254 - Jackie, that's funny. Look,
when my dad went to prison,\\
255 - that's what someone told me
to make me feel better.\\
256 - It was my mom!
We had a real good laugh!\\
257 - Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
can you settle this for us?\\
258 - If someone you love
is kind of depressed,\\
259 - should you shower them with
kindness or give them space?\\
260 - Well, now,
that's a very good question.\\
261 - And it really takes a lot of
living with someone to get it right.\\
262 - - That's true.
- But you'll find
the thing to do is...\\
263 - - Give them space.
- ...shower them...\\
264 - What did you say?\\
265 - I said what you said.\\
266 - - You're lying.
- Oh, come on, Kitty!\\
267 - When menopause makes you crazy,\\
268 - I could be with you all day
and it wouldn't do any good.\\
269 - You need space.\\
270 - Oh. Menopause makes me crazy?\\
271 - I'm crazy?\\
272 - I'm crazy?\\
273 - Well, if you want space,
Red Forman, you got it!\\
274 - This crazy lady's
out the crazy door!\\
275 - We were having a nice lunch.\\
276 - Okay, Hyde, I feel really bad,
and I shouldn't have shot you.\\
277 - And I think that I might've
done it on purpose\\
278 - 'cause I'm not okay with you and
Jackie and I don't know if I ever will be.\\
279 - But I'm almost positive that
I'll never, ever shoot you again.\\
280 - But the only way to be sure
is for you to shoot me.\\
281 - I've always responded really
well to corporal punishment.\\
282 - So, here.\\
283 - Do it. Shoot me.\\
284 - This is like Old Yeller.\\
285 - Come on, man. Just do it.
Right here. It's the only way.\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - You lied!\\
288 - You're dead, man!\\
289 - So, how's stuff with your dad?\\
290 - Well, my mom's flying home
from the Fiesta de las Margaritas.\\
291 - - So I guess
it's pretty serious.
- Hmm.\\
292 - Wow, that is serious.\\
293 - Playboy voted
Fiesta de las Margaritas\\
294 - Latin America's
number one singles party.\\
295 - But I'm
sure she's just there for the margaritas.\\
296 - Oh, my God, you guys, my
whole world is just falling apart.\\
297 - Hey.\\
298 - Steven!
You shaved your beard off!\\
299 - I thought it might cheer you up.\\
300 - Oh, my God.
You shaved it off for me.\\
301 - You let the razor say the
words your mouth couldn't speak.\\
302 - - Aww.
- Shut up!\\
303 - So I guess the answer to the
problem wasn't more or less space,\\
304 - it was more or less hair.\\
305 - And that's bizarre.\\
306 - Okay, I've been
thinking about it,\\
307 - about the space thing,
and I got it.\\
308 - You'll talk about stuff,
and I'll just leave.\\
309 - And I'll follow you.\\
310 - Because I'm strong enough to
take you down and make you listen.\\
311 - And I will let you lie on me
and pretend that it bothers me.\\
312 - Guys, something
horrible has happened.\\
313 - The little man in my pants
has turned black.\\
314 - It's not funny!\\
315 - Black is the color of death!\\
316 - Oh, my little man is going to die
before he gets to see the world.\\
317 - I'm so sorry.\\
318 - How could this happen?\\
319 - How?\\
320 - Okay, I washed, but the ink
isn't coming off my little man. Help.\\
321 - You should try bleach.\\
322 - - Ooh. Or Comet.
- Yeah. Or steel wool.\\
323 - Hey, and if all else fails the one
thing that gets out ink is more ink.\\
324 - That's right, Hyde.
But whatever you do,\\
325 - use the steel wool first.\\
326 - Really scrub,
so the soap gets in there.\\
327 - Remember, if it doesn't sting,
it's not working.
\subsection {Episode 10: The Crunge}
1 - Guess what.\\
2 - Oh, nobody guess.
It's always about boobs.\\
3 - Oh, come on. Don't you want
to know what I have to say?\\
4 - Man, I never know
what you have to say.\\
5 - I mean, in your head
you're speaking English\\
6 - but when it comes out,
it's all buzzes and clicks.\\
7 - Oh, really?\\
8 - Well, I guess I was speaking
English to the SATs\\
9 - because I got 1000 points.\\
10 - Oh, and last night on cable
I saw four boobs.\\
11 - Wait. So the SATs are in?
Donna, did you see your scores yet?\\
12 - Yeah. This morning.
I got 1230.\\
13 - What? A 1230? That's great.
Why didn't you say something?\\
14 - Well, I didn't want to brag.\\
15 - I mean, yeah, I kicked ass,
but it's no big deal.\\
16 - Eric. Eric, honey.\\
17 - I got the mail and your SAT
envelope happened to be open,\\
18 - and the letter just sort of
slid into my hand,\\
19 - and I accidentally put on my
reading glasses, and I saw your score.\\
20 - You got an 800!\\
21 - I got an 800? That's it?\\
22 - "That's it"?\\
23 - If 100 is an "A," eight of
them is an A-plus-plus.\\
24 - No. No, Mrs. Forman,
an 800 is not good.\\
25 - I mean, a pigeon can peck
a better score than that.\\
26 - - Really?
- Donna did better. Fez did, too.\\
27 - And his whole country's
made of bamboo.\\
28 - This is awkward.\\
29 - I'll just...\\
30 - I'll go home
and take down the streamers.\\
31 - Forman, the SATs prove nothing.\\
32 - I mean, I got 950, and I
don't even have any textbooks.\\
33 - Or a locker.\\
34 - Wait, wait. A 950?\\
35 - Steven, I knew it.
You do have potential.\\
36 - Yeah. Imagine what I could do
if I only applied myself.\\
37 - Oh, well, guess
we'll never know.\\
38 - I just... I can't believe
I got the lowest score here.\\
39 - Oh, Eric, someone
had to come in last.\\
40 - There is no shame in that.\\
41 - Well, there is a little shame.\\
42 - Shame on you.\\
43 - Hey.\\
44 - You know, who cares what
anyone got? It's just a stupid test.\\
45 - You know what?
You're right. I don't care.\\
46 - I got 1030!\\
47 - Yeah!\\
48 - I did good on a test, man.\\
49 - Something's happening to me.
I'm blooming like a flower.\\
50 - So the SATs proved it.
Donna's the smart one.\\
51 - Eric, on the other hand... Well, I
don't wanna say there's a dumb one,\\
52 - but there's two,
and he ain't the smart one.\\
53 - That's where you're wrong, Bob.\\
54 - Eric got an A-plus-plus.\\
55 - Oh, um...\\
56 - No.\\
57 - See, Red, it turns out
Eric still did very well.\\
58 - It's just,
some other people did better.\\
59 - - Donna?
- Yes.\\
60 - - Steven?
- Yes.\\
61 - Not the foreign kid.\\
62 - Yes.\\
63 - Kelso?\\
64 - Yes.\\
65 - He did worse than Kelso?\\
66 - I watched that kid
glue his hand to his face.\\
67 - You.\\
68 - What happened on the SATs?\\
69 - Okay, you know
he's not good under pressure.\\
70 - He can't pee in a public restroom
because there's an audience.\\
71 - You know what?
This is a family thing.\\
72 - I'll leave you to it.\\
73 - - What's wrong with you?
- I don't know. Maybe I'm not smart.\\
74 - - Who says you're not smart?
- You.\\
75 - - When?
- Always.\\
76 - Your problem is
you got your head up your ass.\\
77 - Your father's afraid that you're
spending a little too much time\\
78 - on a high school romance.\\
79 - That's right.
Donna gums up the works.\\
80 - Whoa. It's not
her fault, okay?\\
81 - I was prepared for that test.
I had three sharp pencils.\\
82 - That's one more than
recommended, by the way.\\
83 - I remember sitting there,
filling out the little bubbles...\\
84 - - Well, that was a blast.
- Sure was.\\
85 - Now why don't you point
yourself toward my villa\\
86 - and park this thing
in my garage?\\
87 - Oh, I'm planning on that, but
what should I do with the car?\\
88 - We better hurry.
We only have five minutes.\\
89 - Well, that's four more
than I need, baby.\\
90 - I repeat. There's only five
minutes left in this section of the test.\\
91 - Oh, my God.
Donna does gum up the works.\\
92 - See? Now use what little brains
you've got and hit the books, dumb ass.\\
93 - Kelso, what the hell
are you doing with a book?\\
94 - Reading.\\
95 - I am reading.\\
96 - 'Cause what good is having
brains if you got nothing up here?\\
97 - - Hi.
- Hey.\\
98 - So I saw my dad in prison today.\\
99 - Oh. How was it?\\
100 - Well, at first it was a downer\\
101 - but then I realized that
I'll be okay without my dad.\\
102 - Because the SATs prove that there's
another man who could take care of me.\\
103 - You better be
talking about Santa Claus.\\
104 - No, Steven, I'm talking about
you. Because you have potential.\\
105 - He doesn't have potential.
I have potential.\\
106 - Like, I'm reading Moby Dick,
and I'm not even halfway through\\
107 - and I can already tell you the
ending. The whale is a robot.\\
108 - Steven, just imagine
what your life would be like\\
109 - with the love and support
of a good woman.\\
110 - Oh! Thank God for your strong
SATs. Now we don't have to be poor.\\
111 - Not poor, indeed.\\
112 - Basic math and verbal skills
are the ticket to great wealth\\
113 - and therefore great happiness.\\
114 - Poor person!
Bring me a fancy cocktail.\\
115 - It is my privilege
to wait on you, madam.\\
116 - Oh, quite so, quite so.\\
117 - All right, enough with the
idle chatter. Go be poor.\\
118 - Wait. Someone's playing
the harp in the corner?\\
119 - 'Cause if I'm rich,
I'm hiring, like, Jethro Tull.\\
120 - Who cares? It's the
same thing every time.\\
121 - I'm a butler, I'm a bellhop,
I'm a stable boy.\\
122 - Well, I've had enough!\\
123 - I will not wait on you people
anymore. Got it?\\
124 - Good.\\
125 - Now who wants a Popsicle?\\
126 - Wow. Here's something
I did not know.\\
127 - They number every page.\\
128 - Hey. You guys. You know how Red's
always telling me I need to buckle down?\\
129 - Well, turns out he's right.
I do have to buckle down.\\
130 - You sure do. He's got an 800.
There's your butler.\\
131 - Man, how can I ever marry Donna?\\
132 - I mean, I'm an idiot around her
now, and we're only engaged.\\
133 - What?\\
134 - Oops.\\
135 - You're engaged?\\
136 - No.\\
137 - How could you
give her that ring?\\
138 - You're in high school, man,
and according to the SATs\\
139 - that's about as far
as you're gonna go.\\
140 - Look. Just don't tell Donna
I told you, okay?\\
141 - She'd kill me.
It's supposed to be a secret.\\
142 - Of course she wants it a secret.\\
143 - "I'm marrying dumb guy."
Who wants that spread around?\\
144 - You know, maybe Eric's
bad score is a blessing.\\
145 - It'll be a good story
when he's a senator.\\
146 - Senator?\\
147 - The word you're
looking for is "janitor."\\
148 - Okay, see? That's why
Eric did so poorly on that test.\\
149 - It's because
you're too hard on him.\\
150 - I have to be hard on him
'cause you always baby him.\\
151 - Because you're so hard on him.\\
152 - You babied him
before I was hard on him.\\
153 - You were hard on him
when he was a baby.\\
154 - Hey, I just found out,
I can take the SATs again.\\
155 - I'm gonna... I'm gonna take
it again, and I'm gonna nail it.\\
156 - I just gotta buckle down. I'm
gonna kick a little SAT butt.\\
157 - - Attaboy!
- Good for you!\\
158 - - Think he'll do any better?
- Nah.\\
159 - Yeah.\\
160 - Hi. What are you doing?\\
161 - Studying.\\
162 - I'd love to hang out, but
I've really gotta buckle down.\\
163 - All right.
Can I raid the fridge?\\
164 - My dad wrote "Save for Bob"
on all the food at our house.\\
165 - Oops. I dropped the margarine.\\
166 - Butterfingers.\\
167 - It's so slippery I can barely
get my fingers around it.\\
168 - I gotta go.\\
169 - - Ground me.
- What?\\
170 - I am not strong enough. If I'm
gonna shake this Donna thing,\\
171 - I am gonna need some serious
discipline. Please ground me.\\
172 - You got it, pal.\\
173 - You're grounded.\\
174 - One more thing.
Donna's in the kitchen.\\
175 - I need you to get
rid of her for me.\\
176 - - Do I have to be
nice about it?
- No.\\
177 - This is the happiest day
of my life.\\
178 - Hey. Hey, Steven. Great news.\\
179 - I found a couple
of savings bonds\\
180 - and I can cash them in
to help you pay for college.\\
181 - - Jackie...
- You're
going to college?\\
182 - I am so happy!\\
183 - You were an orphan, and we
took you in, and now look at you.\\
184 - I'm proud of you.\\
185 - And that money that
you've been paying in rent?\\
186 - I put it in a bank account
for college.\\
187 - Or bail. But this is better.\\
188 - Okay, enough.\\
189 - Jackie, college is a waste of
time, and I'm not going, okay?\\
190 - - So just butt the hell out.
- No. No, Steven,
I won't butt out\\
191 - because you need to be pushed,
and we need to think about our future.\\
192 - Look. Even if we have a future,
it's not gonna be what you wanted.\\
193 - It's gonna be more like...\\
194 - - Steven, do you think I'm fat?
- I know you're fat.\\
195 - Go get me a beer.\\
196 - - Oh, my God.
- Yeah. It ain't pretty.\\
197 - Please tell me they won't
be living in our basement.\\
198 - Well, we'll be dead by then.\\
199 - Oh, good.\\
200 - You grounded yourself?\\
201 - What? Why would I do that?\\
202 - Well, apparently,
I "gum up the works."\\
203 - Oh, good.
So someone filled you in.\\
204 - Yeah. Red. When he
kicked me out of your kitchen.\\
205 - And then he locked
the sliding door,\\
206 - and stood there
laughing and waving.\\
207 - Eric, why are you freaking out
about this test?\\
208 - I'm not. I'm gonna take it
again, and I'm gonna nail it.\\
209 - Anything less than
a 1240 is unacceptable.\\
210 - A 1240?\\
211 - Hmm. That's 10 more
points than I got.\\
212 - Really? That's weird.\\
213 - You're threatened because
I got a better score than you.\\
214 - - I just... I have to do
better than you.
- Why?\\
215 - Because I'm the man,
and the man's the man,\\
216 - and that's just the way it is.\\
217 - What did you say?\\
218 - I'm grounded.
Dad, Donna's up here!\\
219 - - That's it.
- What's it?\\
220 - This chapter just helped me figure out
the answer to you and Donna's problem,\\
221 - vis-a-vis your crappy score.\\
222 - "Vis-a-vis"?\\
223 - It's a PBS word, Eric.
Stay with me here.\\
224 - Yeah, I liken your situation
to that of Pavlov's dog.\\
225 - You see,
Pavlov was this science guy,\\
226 - and every time his dog would
ring a bell, Pavlov would eat.\\
227 - Are you sure it was the dog
who rang the bell?\\
228 - Yeah. I mean,
who else would it be?\\
229 - Pavlov?\\
230 - Well, that wouldn't be a trick,
Eric. What man can't ring a bell?\\
231 - Anyway, every time that dog
would ring that bell,\\
232 - old Pavlov would eat,
and then he would drool.\\
233 - You just read that chapter
two seconds ago.\\
234 - - Do you even want my help?
- No!\\
235 - Your loss!\\
236 - Okay. So what's wrong
with you and Donna?\\
237 - She did better than me
on that test,\\
238 - and I'm sorry, but that
is just not gonna fly,\\
239 - because I am the man, and the man's
the man, and that's just the way it is.\\
240 - Well, honey, everybody
has different skills.\\
241 - I do better on tests
than your father,\\
242 - but he's the one brave enough
to kill spiders.\\
243 - And since we've been married,
how many tests have I taken? None.\\
244 - How many spiders
has your father killed?\\
245 - Hundreds.\\
246 - But, Mom, spiders freak me out.\\
247 - We all have different qualities.\\
248 - But the thing to remember is
how you do on some silly test\\
249 - is much less important than
how you behave in real life.\\
250 - I'll take a dummy
over a jackass any day.\\
251 - So am I a dummy or a jackass?\\
252 - Well, honey,
right now you're both.\\
253 - Okay, Steven, about
your vision of our future\\
254 - with you swilling beer
and me being fat?\\
255 - That's not gonna happen,
because I'm not gonna be fat.\\
256 - It's genetic.\\
257 - That's true.\\
258 - Her mother drinks two bottles of
wine a day and she looks damn good.\\
259 - No, I've seen her vacuum
in her underwear.\\
260 - - So what's your point?
- My point is
she's freaking hot.\\
261 - Not you.\\
262 - Steven, all I'm saying is that I've
become accustomed to a certain lifestyle,\\
263 - and if you would just
live up to your potential...\\
264 - I don't know why you're
talking to 950 guy over there.\\
265 - I got 1030.
I got 80 more potential.\\
266 - Yeah, but Steven has my heart.\\
267 - Which is why
I want him to be rich.\\
268 - I mean, think about all the
stuff you could buy for me.\\
269 - Jackie,\\
270 - why don't you earn your own
money and buy those things yourself?\\
271 - Myself?\\
272 - And I'm not like Forman. I have no
problem mooching off your success.\\
273 - You know, you leave the room, I
steal some money from your purse.\\
274 - You pretend I didn't,
but we both know I did.\\
275 - That's the future I see for us.\\
276 - Oh, Steven, that's beautiful.\\
277 - Oh, wait. So you don't even
care that I did better than him?\\
278 - Not really.\\
279 - Well, if being smart isn't gonna
help me impress the chicks\\
280 - then I want no part of it.\\
281 - I'm gonna go back to coasting
through life on my good looks.\\
282 - Hey, and my brains
will always be there,\\
283 - so if I ever need them,
I'll just whip them out\\
284 - and use them like a secret
emergency rocket pack.\\
285 - - That's a good plan, man.
- Hey, it beats
the hell out of reading.\\
286 - - Okay, Donna, look.
- Don't worry, Eric.\\
287 - I'm only reading the funnies.\\
288 - Business section's
for the man, right?\\
289 - Donna, the thing is,
I'm a jackass and I know it.\\
290 - Well, I know it, too.\\
291 - Look. Okay, the only reason
I said what I said is,\\
292 - you agreed to marry me before
the facts were in, right?\\
293 - So now I'm thinking
that maybe, you know,\\
294 - you might want to trade up.\\
295 - That's so stupid.\\
296 - Okay, I swear to God, if one
more person calls me stupid today...\\
297 - Eric.\\
298 - Eric, my entire life,\\
299 - everywhere I've gone
and everything I've done\\
300 - has been better because
you were there with me.\\
301 - And no test score
is gonna change that.\\
302 - Wow. That was amazing.\\
303 - Did you come up
with that yourself?\\
304 - Well, I saw Mr. Ingalls say it to
Mary on Little House on the Prairie.\\
305 - I just made it a test score
instead of blindness.\\
306 - But I still think it's true.\\
307 - So, you're still glad
we're engaged?\\
308 - Of course.\\
309 - Good. Hey,
speaking of Little House,\\
310 - did you ever see
that one where Laura\\
311 - accidentally told Kelso, Hyde, Fez and
Jackie that she was engaged to Donna?\\
312 - Eric, are you kidding me?\\
313 - God. You can't even
keep a secret?\\
314 - Hey, Donna, I got an 800. We're
lucky I can wash myself, okay?\\
315 - Poor person! Where's my drink?\\
316 - Where's your drink?
What about my drink?\\
317 - Next time you ask where your
drink is, it will be in your ass.\\
318 - It's so hard to get good
poor people these days.
\subsection {Episode 11: The Girl I Love}
1 - Why would Sports
Illustrated even publish\\
2 - an issue that's
not a swimsuit issue?\\
3 - You know who should do
a swimsuit issue? Playboy.\\
4 - Why would you put clothes
on a centrefold?\\
5 - Sometimes I get tired
of all the complete nakedness\\
6 - and I like to be
teased a little.\\
7 - Yeah, there's a lot more going
on up here than you know about.\\
8 - I think there's some stuff going on
in there that you don't know about.\\
9 - You guys should have come
to the arboretum with us.\\
10 - We saw plants and trees
from all over the world.\\
11 - There was a bush from Morocco.\\
12 - Smelled like
chocolate chip cookies.\\
13 - Ah, that is the perfect bush.\\
14 - Thanks for taking me to the
arboretum. It was really fun.\\
15 - Yeah, what a great day.\\
16 - What a horrible day!\\
17 - I don't mind looking
at some trees, okay?\\
18 - But when they put little signs
on them with little Latin names,\\
19 - it makes me want to harm myself.\\
20 - So the missus took you out
for some girl fun, huh?\\
21 - See, Donna is hot,
but she is mean.\\
22 - My girlfriend Nina? Just hot.\\
23 - You know, Fez, you talk a lot
about this Nina chick,\\
24 - but none of us
have ever seen her.\\
25 - Yeah, we're actually
starting to suspect\\
26 - that she's some creepy alter ego\\
27 - you visit late at night
in front of the mirror.\\
28 - Oh, no, I don't do that anymore.\\
29 - But Nina is the real deal.
Kelso saw her at the DMV.\\
30 - There were a lot of girls there.\\
31 - She could have been the one with
the lazy eye that does the vision test.\\
32 - Lazy-eye Lizzie? No way.
She wouldn't even look at me.\\
33 - Nina, my friends don't believe
me that you're my girlfriend,\\
34 - even though I frenched you.\\
35 - Girlfriend? I don't
know if we're there yet.\\
36 - I mean, I like you
and all, it's just that\\
37 - all the guys at
the DMV seem great\\
38 - until you find them in your
apartment wearing your hot curlers.\\
39 - Warren.\\
40 - I want to get to know you
better, meet your friends,\\
41 - make sure they're not puppets.\\
42 - Warren.\\
43 - So, if they are not puppets,
then would you be my girlfriend?\\
44 - Mmm, it would definitely help.\\
45 - Are these lines open or not?\\
46 - Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.\\
47 - That was very unprofessional.\\
48 - Hanging out\\
49 - Down the street\\
50 - The same old thing\\
51 - We did last week\\
52 - Not a thing to do\\
53 - But talk to you\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
57 - So, we're finally gonna meet the
mysterious and possibly fictional Nina.\\
58 - Fictional? Does this
hickey look fictional?\\
59 - Huh, looks too small to be from
the vacuum cleaner, like last time.\\
60 - Wait, let me see.\\
61 - Small, blotchy and uneven.
Ah, this girl's an amateur.\\
62 - Let me see. Small, blotchy and
unpleasant. Yeah, this girl's a Jackie.\\
63 - Well, Fez, I am
thrilled that you found a girl\\
64 - 'cause I was starting to worry.\\
65 - But you've proven me and the
experts from Reader's Digest wrong!\\
66 - When I introduce her to
everybody, I just want it to be special.\\
67 - Oh! Let's have a formal
dinner party tomorrow.\\
68 - You know, it was at a
dinner party that I first realised\\
69 - Red Forman was more
than just a boy with great hair.\\
70 - Sounds good, Miss Kitty.\\
71 - You might be a little past your
prime, but your mind is still sharp.\\
72 - Oh, actually tomorrow night's
not gonna work.\\
73 - I thought we might
go see Laser Floyd.\\
74 - Well, you tell this fellow Floyd
that you have a dinner party.\\
75 - No,
Mom, Laser Floyd's not a guy.\\
76 - Laser Floyd is Pink
Floyd music with lasers.\\
77 - Lasers, like in Star Wars.\\
78 - Mrs. Forman, we'll be here.\\
79 - Wait. You'd rather go
to a formal dinner party?\\
80 - Sure. Sounds great.\\
81 - And don't forget, Mrs. Forman,
you can count Steven and me in.\\
82 - Yeah, I've been
looking for an excuse\\
83 - to buy him a shirt with buttons.\\
84 - And since it's
a special occasion,\\
85 - you're all
allowed one sip of wine.\\
86 - Great! It'll be like Communion,
but without the fun of church.\\
87 - So, Steven, you know,
I was thinking of getting you\\
88 - a pair of beige corduroys and
maybe a blue blazer for the party.\\
89 - Oh, don't forget the
matching scarf and gloves.\\
90 - This way, I'll be nice and
toasty when hell freezes over.\\
91 - Uh-oh, Jackie.
Looks like Steven\\
92 - doesn't wanna wear
his big-boy clothes.\\
93 - No, I just don't wanna go.\\
94 - You know, you should have
asked me before you said I would.\\
95 - Steven! I am your girlfriend.
I speak for you now!\\
96 - Well, then, tell yourself I said
to bite me, 'cause I'm not going.\\
97 - Oh, you are so going!
So just bite yourself!\\
98 - Man, do you believe that crap?\\
99 - Tell me about it.\\
100 - Donna wants to go to a dinner
party, we go to a dinner party.\\
101 - If she wants to go to the arboretum,
bang, I'm in a room full of trees.\\
102 - God, I hate trees.\\
103 - So tall and arrogant.\\
104 - So why don't you just not go?\\
105 - Oh, it's just one day.\\
106 - Not for you, man.
You're engaged.\\
107 - It's Latin for
"screwed for life."\\
108 - Oh, my God, you're right.\\
109 - And I have no choice.
I have to do what she says\\
110 - or she won't let me
touch her naughty places.\\
111 - Hyde, this is extortion!\\
112 - You're telling me?\\
113 - I'm being shaken down by a
95-pound brunette with pink toenails.\\
114 - Kitty? I know this change
of life has upset you\\
115 - but we just bought
wine the other day.\\
116 - What are you doing, brushing
your teeth with the stuff?\\
117 - Red, it's not for me.\\
118 - Well, this one is.\\
119 - We're having a dinner party
tomorrow night.\\
120 - No, can't do it. Battle of
the Network Stars is on.\\
121 - See, once a year,
they make TV stars\\
122 - compete at things
they're not good at.\\
123 - I look forward all season to watching
Ed Asner try to paddle a canoe.\\
124 - Makes me feel superior.\\
125 - Well, you shouldn't
feel superior, because\\
126 - you know what I
know about Ed Asner?\\
127 - Ed Asner would come
to my dinner party,\\
128 - 'cause he knows
how to treat a woman.\\
129 - Did you say "dinner party"?\\
130 - See, I thought
you... Oh, screw it, I'll be there.\\
131 - What's this about a party?\\
132 - Oh, well, we're having a party
tomorrow night for Fez and Nina.\\
133 - I invited all the kids.\\
134 - I'm a kid.\\
135 - Well, it's for couples only. You
can come if you bring a date.\\
136 - Well, it's too late to
find a date. I mean...\\
137 - Yeah, I'm sweet looking,
but I'm no miracle worker.\\
138 - Well, maybe if you stop jumping\\
139 - from girl to girl,
you wouldn't be alone.\\
140 - You're no Frank Sinatra,
you know!\\
141 - You know, you used to be nice,
but you've changed, lady!\\
142 - Guys, I really
want Nina to like me,\\
143 - so, please,
avoid the following topics,\\
144 - my addiction to candy,\\
145 - the fact that I have needs,\\
146 - and my use of
Alberto VO5 Hot Oil Treatment.\\
147 - Wait. Fez, what does she care
what you use on your hair?\\
148 - Oh, I do not use it on my hair.\\
149 - Well, heard about
your secret couples party.\\
150 - And I'm glad I'm not going,
'cause I hate parties.\\
151 - Hey, man, I'm only going
'cause Donna's making me.\\
152 - At this rate, the only
way I'll see Laser Floyd\\
153 - is if they project it on a leaf
canopy at the arboretum.\\
154 - So, don't go to the party.
Act tough, Forman.\\
155 - I'm not tough.\\
156 - That's why I said "act."\\
157 - No one's making me go,
that's for sure.\\
158 - Oh, that is it, Steven.
As your girlfriend,\\
159 - I am ordering you
to go to this party.\\
160 - And as your boyfriend,\\
161 - I'm ordering you to take your
bossy mouth and flap it elsewhere.\\
162 - If you flap it at me,
I'll go with you.\\
163 - Do you hear that, Steven? Michael
wants to go to the party with me.\\
164 - I'm not going to the party.\\
165 - Fine.\\
166 - Michael, I would love
to go to the party with you.\\
167 - Kick-ass! I love parties!\\
168 - Okay, now. These are called
after-dinner conversation cards.\\
169 - Let's try one.\\
170 - "If you were a bird, where
would you fly?" Donna?\\
171 - Um... South?\\
172 - I don't know. I'm nervous.
I feel like I'm on Jeopardy!\\
173 - If I were a bird,
I'd fly to Laser Floyd.\\
174 - I'd fly to Tahiti, 'cause the
girls there don't wear tops!\\
175 - Wait, but then I'd want
to change back into myself\\
176 - because no lady wants
to make it with a bird.\\
177 - Wait, can I be a monkey?\\
178 - Okay.\\
179 - Nina!\\
180 - I'd fly to my
favourite place, the DMV.\\
181 - I was just going to say that.\\
182 - Red, we haven't
heard a peep out of you.\\
183 - If I was a bird,
I'd fly into a ceiling fan.\\
184 - Steven, you came,
just like I thought you would.\\
185 - You buckled!\\
186 - No, I got hungry.\\
187 - You're in my seat.\\
188 - Damn, Hyde, now
everyone knows it's a clip-on!\\
189 - Since you two work at the DMV,\\
190 - how about you make this
parking ticket disappear?\\
191 - We can't fix this.
You parked in a fire lane.\\
192 - Oh, Nina, please.\\
193 - We're his guests. I'll
take care of it, little buddy.\\
194 - No, Fez, he broke the law.\\
195 - Broke the law?\\
196 - I was just getting some milk.\\
197 - But what if there was a fire?\\
198 - Then I'd pour my milk on it.\\
199 - Okay.\\
200 - Okay, let's try another card.\\
201 - "If you could be anyone's
shoe, whose shoe would you be?"\\
202 - I wouldn't want to
be Red's shoe, 'cause\\
203 - I think it's about to
go in someone's ass.\\
204 - That's it! I'm watching
Battle of the Network Stars.\\
205 - I'm with you.
Have fun with Mr. Clip-on.\\
206 - Yeah, you know what? Me, too.\\
207 - Wait, you're leaving?\\
208 - There are lasers
going off right now!\\
209 - Perfectly synchronised lasers!\\
210 - And all of a sudden,
you're like Lady Dinner Roll,\\
211 - shaking me down with
her naughty places!\\
212 - I'm going, too.\\
213 - Apparently we can eat a man's
food, but we cannot fix his ticket!\\
214 - Well, what happened
to my dinner party?\\
215 - I'm sorry, Mrs. Forman,
but Marilu Henner\\
216 - only gets on
the trampoline once a year\\
217 - and I'm not gonna miss it.\\
218 - Where the hell does Eric get off\\
219 - acting like I make him do stuff?\\
220 - I mean,
it's not like I wanted us\\
221 - to come to this
dinner party either.\\
222 - I only did because,\\
223 - well, you're all menopausey
now and you scare me!\\
224 - Right, you came for me.\\
225 - Just like I slaved over
a pot roast for all of you.\\
226 - You want a definition of hell?\\
227 - Try opening a 400-degree oven
while you're having a hot flash.\\
228 - We're all here for someone else.\\
229 - And you know why? It's
right there in front of us, girls.\\
230 - Women are giving.\\
231 - I'm not giving!\\
232 - I'm here for me.\\
233 - Steven is the one who
should think about others.\\
234 - I mean, how could
he just ditch me?\\
235 - Well, Jackie, it might
have something to do\\
236 - with you trying
to boss him around\\
237 - and then showing up with Kelso.\\
238 - She's right.\\
239 - I know she's right.\\
240 - But you're not
a part of the group,\\
241 - and I don't like you, so zip it!\\
242 - Man, look at you guys,
all forced to hide\\
243 - in the basement
because of your women.\\
244 - Hey, I'm not hiding from anyone.\\
245 - I finally set Donna straight.\\
246 - Alls you did was babble about
lasers and naughty places.\\
247 - Man, I thought you
were having a stroke.\\
248 - Whatever, man. You
caved just like Jackie wanted.\\
249 - I didn't cave.\\
250 - Just wanted to make sure
Don Juan el Tardo here\\
251 - kept his hands off her.\\
252 - Then how do you
explain the necktie?\\
253 - I just came from
a business meeting.\\
254 - At least he's putting up
a fight. You just gave up.\\
255 - Like France.\\
256 - Oh, get off his back, little
buddy. You were at the party, too.\\
257 - Hey, I fought
the good fight for 30 years.\\
258 - Now I just agree with what Kitty\\
259 - wants to do,
so I can go to sleep.\\
260 - And I'm not your
"little buddy."\\
261 - Yeah, you're all doomed.
That's funny.\\
262 - No, we're not all doomed.\\
263 - One man here still has a chance.\\
264 - One man can take
a stand for all of us.\\
265 - And that man's name is...\\
266 - Well, we can't pronounce his
real name, so we call him Fez!\\
267 - I don't want to take a stand, I
just want Nina to be my girlfriend\\
268 - and give me nooky!\\
269 - Fez, come on. Give it a try!\\
270 - It'll be like Battle of the
Network Stars. Think about it.\\
271 - Welcome back to the
Battle of the Gender Stars,\\
272 - where it's
the gals with 50 points!\\
273 - And the guys with zero.\\
274 - But the guys still have a chance\\
275 - 'cause our final event is
conveniently worth 51 points.\\
276 - You guys are pathetic!\\
277 - Wow, that's some
tough talk, Jamie Farr.\\
278 - I'm switching to the gals' team.\\
279 - I can do that, because I
wear a dress on M.A.S.H.\\
280 - Okay, now let's
meet our contestants.\\
281 - Representing the gals,
the lovely Nina!\\
282 - And representing the guys,
the lovely Fez!\\
283 - Fighters, go!\\
284 - Make that tart eat some mud!\\
285 - Oh, I forgot to tell you. We're
going antiquing all weekend!\\
286 - Oh, like hell we are.\\
287 - I hate antiquing.
Let's do this thing!\\
288 - That's right. Gentlemen,
let's go get our cojones back!\\
289 - I gotta see this.\\
290 - Hey, man, you coming?\\
291 - No, I still have my cojones.\\
292 - My lonely, lonely cojones.\\
293 - Oh, look who it is. You bake a
brownie, and the bastards come running.\\
294 - I'm afraid your brownies
are powerless now.\\
295 - Fez has something to say. Fez?\\
296 - Can I have a brownie?\\
297 - Fez!\\
298 - Right, right, right, right.\\
299 - Nina, I insist you take care of
Red's ticket because I am in charge.\\
300 - Yeah, that's not gonna happen.\\
301 - Okay.\\
302 - Man, what the hell?\\
303 - I have needs.\\
304 - Nina, if I do everything you
want, would you be my girlfriend?\\
305 - Can't say no to that!\\
306 - I cannot believe it!\\
307 - I have a girlfriend!\\
308 - So when do we do it?\\
309 - I am not speaking to you.\\
310 - Well, at least it'll be quiet
enough to go to sleep.\\
311 - Okay, Donna, when we came up
here, Fez was supposed to... Donna?\\
312 - Oh, crap.\\
313 - Hey, Steven, look.\\
314 - Remember how you said that I was
bossy? Well, I think you were right.\\
315 - So, from now on, if I want you
to do something, I'll ask first.\\
316 - Well, I just...
Wait, shh, I'm talking!\\
317 - I am so sorry.
There I go again.\\
318 - Okay,
here's what I wanted to say.\\
319 - Would you like to go with me to\\
320 - the Girl Scout
Alumni Pancake Breakfast?\\
321 - Jackie,
I'd rather put on a dress\\
322 - and slow dance with
Kelso on Soul Train.\\
323 - But since you
asked nicely, I'll go.\\
324 - Yay! Oh, Steven, don't
forget to bring a spatula\\
325 - because I signed
you up as a flipper.\\
326 - Hey, the flipper
better be the guy\\
327 - who judges
the Alumni Bikini Contest!\\
328 - It's not.\\
329 - Donna...\\
330 - Wait, let me guess.\\
331 - Laser Floyd, Laser Floyd,
arboretum, dinner roll, Laser Floyd.\\
332 - Okay, listen.
No, you listen.\\
333 - I don't know
what's wrong with you,\\
334 - if it's genetic, or if you took a
pill from your mother's cabinet.\\
335 - But I'm through
doing stuff for you,\\
336 - because you don't appreciate it.\\
337 - Whoa, whoa, wait.
You're doing stuff for me?\\
338 - Yeah! I went to that dinner
party to make your mother happy,\\
339 - and I went to the arboretum
because you wanted to.\\
340 - I wanted to? All I said
was, "Look, the arboretum."\\
341 - Well, it sounded
like you wanted to go.\\
342 - I hate trees!\\
343 - I mean, "Ooh, show me trees!"
Does that sound like me?\\
344 - No. Look, I'm sorry.\\
345 - I just... I thought you were
gonna make me do girlie crap\\
346 - for the rest of my life.\\
347 - Eric, come on. You know
me way better than that.\\
348 - Yeah, you're right.\\
349 - So, would you like to go see
Laser Floyd next weekend?\\
350 - Oh, we can't. I signed us up for
this class, Quilting for Couples.\\
351 - I'm kidding!\\
352 - It's just for men.\\
353 - And the canoeing champion for
this year's Battle of the Network Stars\\
354 - is Red Forman!\\
355 - My team!\\
356 - Thanks, Jamie Farr.\\
357 - And I'd like to give a
special thanks to Ed Asner.\\
358 - Ed, thanks for paddling
your canoe like a girl.\\
359 - Where's your spunk now,
you big pansy?

151 - WHY, THE GREEN SWEATER STORE,
DONNA. GOOD THINKING.\\
152 - HEY, WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?\\
153 - BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR URGES.\\

MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER?\\
197 - NOT IF YOU DON'T LET US
DRINK IT.\\
198 - SHUT IT.\\
199 - NOW LET'S CLEAR
THIS PLACE OUT.\\
200 - IF WE HURRY,
I DON'T HAVE TO SLEEP HERE.\\
201 - I HATE NATURE.\\
202 - OH, GOD, STEVEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THOUGHT YOU FINALLY UNDERSTOOD\\
203 - WHAT BEING A COUPLE
IS ALL ABOUT.\\
204 - WELL, WHAT IS BEING
A COUPLE?\\
205 - IT'S ALL ABOUT GIVE AND TAKE,
YIN AND YANG.\\
206 - IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL PARADOX,\\
207 - LIKE A TREE FALLING
IN THE FOREST\\
208 - WITH NO ONE AROUND
TO HEAR IT.\\
209 - DOES IT MAKE A NOISE?
WHO'S TO SAY?\\
210 - OKAY, YOU'RE JUST
CONFUSING ME.\\
211 - YOU SEE? IT'S MURKY.\\
212 - THAT'S WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST.\\
213 - OH, MY GOD.

214 - WHO'S TO SAY
WHAT CRAP IS?\\
215 - HERE, PULL MY VASE.\\
216 - OH, I KNOW THIS ONE.
NO, THANK YOU.\\
217 - NO! MAN, IT'S STUCK.\\
218 - I PUT THE STASH IN HERE,\\
219 - AND NOW I CAN'T GET
MY HAND OUT.\\
220 - OH. I CAN HELP.\\
221 - OH, DAMN. I GUESS I LEFT
MY BABY OIL IN THE OTHER PANTS.\\
222 - THIS VASE
SMELLS LIKE CHOCOLATE.\\
223 - REALLY?\\
224 - AAH!\\
225 - YOU CAN'T SEE IT,\\
226 - BUT I'M FLIPPING YOU OFF
RIGHT NOW.\\
227 - WHAT'S GOING ON?\\
228 - OH, JUST A CLASSIC CASE
OF HAND STUCK IN VASE.\\
229 - WELL, GET IT OFF,\\
230 - OR YOU'LL HAVE A CLASSIC CASE
OF FOOT STUCK IN ASS.\\
231 - HEY,
WHAT'S THE TEENY WRITING\\
232 - ON THE BOTTOM OF THE VASE
SAY?\\
233 - WHAT TEENY WRITING?
AAH!\\
234 - STOP DOING THAT!\\
235 - GET SMARTER!\\
236 - j&j&\\
237 - STEVEN, WOULD YOU
BE CAREFUL?\\
238 - THAT'S MY TROPHY
FOR PRETTIEST BALLERINA.\\
239 - OH.
BUT THAT'S RIGHT.\\
240 - YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT STUFF
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.\\
241 - HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LIED\\
242 - AND SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO A DOLL EXPO.\\
243 - YOU SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU.\\
244 - NO, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU, OKAY?\\
245 - YOU SHOULD JUST KNOW.\\
246 - SO I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO MAGICALLY KNOW\\
247 - THAT "I'M GOING TO A DOLL EXPO"
IS JACKIE-SPEAK\\
248 - FOR "MY PARENTS' CABIN
IS BEING FORECLOSED ON\\
249 - "AND I NEED HELP
CLEANING IT OUT"?\\
250 - YES.\\
251 - STEVEN, MY FAMILY
IS FALLING APART,\\
252 - AND YOU'VE NEVER, EVER
EVEN ASKED ABOUT IT!\\
253 - IF YOU CARED, YOU'D FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME\\
254 - AND FIND A WAY TO HELP.\\
255 - JACKIE, THAT'S CRAZY.\\
256 - THE ONLY TIME PEOPLE I KNOW
FIND A WAY TO HELP\\
257 - IS WHEN THEY'RE CUTTING A DEAL
WITH THE D.A.\\
258 - WHATEVER HAPPENS,
YOU'RE DRIVING HER BACK.\\
259 - SHE TALKED SO MUCH
ON THE WAY HERE,\\
260 - I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA
HAVE TO STRAP HER\\
261 - TO THE HOOD OF THE VAN
LIKE A DEER.\\
262 - BOY, JACKIE LOOKS MAD.\\
263 - YEAH, I CHEATED ON HER
LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES,\\
264 - AND SHE NEVER LOOKED
THAT PISSED.\\
265 - COME ON, KELSO,
GRAB THAT END OF THE COUCH.\\
266 - I'VE HAD IT WITH THAT VASE.
I'M GETTING A HAMMER.\\
267 - COME ON.\\
268 - WHY WON'T THIS THING
COME OFF?!\\
269 - LIKE, MY HAND
WOULDN'T BE SO BIG\\
270 - IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO HOLD
THIS STUPID BAG.\\
271 - YOU'RE HOLDING
THE BAG?\\
272 - JUST LET GO,
YOU MORON.\\
273 - FINE.\\
274 - WOW, IT'S LIKE
THE WORLD'S COOLEST PIATA.\\
275 - WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?\\
276 - STEVEN...\\
277 - WHAT'S IN THE BAG?\\
278 - THE PACKERS WIN
IN NEXT YEAR'S SUPER BOWL,\\
279 - THAT'S WHAT'S
IN THE BAG!\\
280 - IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?\\
281 - IF YOU MEAN PAPRIKA,
YES, SIR!\\
282 - HONEY...\\
283 - HONEY, PAPRIKA IS RED.\\
284 - IF YOU MEAN GREEN PAPRIKA,
YES, SIR!\\
285 - GREEN PAPRIKA?\\
286 - HYDE, WHAT AM I
LOOKING FOR HERE?\\
287 - OREGANO.\\
288 - IF YOU MEAN OREGANO,
YES, SIR!\\
289 - DID JACKIE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT DAVIS STREET?\\
290 - NOT UNLESS IT'S\\
291 - "THE STREET WHERE
I DROPPED MY GUM THAT TIME."\\
292 - ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
WE'RE GOING HOME.\\
293 - AND, DONNA, I'M SORRY\\
294 - ABOUT WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOUR URGES.\\
295 - I LOVE YOUR URGES.\\
296 - THEY'VE BEEN...
VERY GOOD TO ME.\\
297 - WELL... THANKS.\\
298 - THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN.\\
299 - UM...\\
300 - I'M WAITING FOR
MY APOLOGY.\\
301 - FOR WHAT?\\
302 - FOR THAT TWINKIE
YOU INHALED.\\
303 - ARE YOU SERIOUS?\\
304 - OKAY, I'M SORRY
I ATE YOUR TWINKIE.\\
305 - YOU ROLLED YOUR EYES.\\
306 - IT DOESN'T COUNT
IF YOU ROLL YOUR EYES.\\
307 - OKAY. I'M SORRY
I ATE YOUR TWINKIE.\\
308 - YOU ROLLED YOUR EYES
AGAIN!\\
309 - IT WAS JUST
A STUPID TWINKIE!\\
310 - IT'S MY TWINKIE, DONNA!\\
311 - IT WAS MY TWINKIE.\\
312 - DO YOU IDIOTS REALIZE
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?\\
313 - HOW COULD THAT BATHROOM
NOT HAVE A WINDOW?\\
314 - WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?\\
315 - WELL, APPARENTLY,
HYDE HAD A STASH\\
316 - THAT NONE OF US
KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT.\\
317 - ESPECIALLY ME.\\
318 - BUT I THINK FEZ KNEW, TOO.\\
319 - THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT IT, FINE.\\
320 - YOU HAVE TO SLEEP
SOMETIME.\\
321 - OKAY, SHUT IT.\\
322 - I'M CALLING
YOUR PARENTS.\\
323 - I'M CALLING IMMIGRATION.\\
324 - AND YOU.\\
325 - I WARNED YOU ONCE
ABOUT THIS CRAP.\\
326 - NOW I HAVE NO CHOICE.\\
327 - YOU'RE OUT OF THE HOUSE.\\
328 - NO, WAIT. LOOK, THAT STASH
WASN'T HIS. IT WAS MINE.\\
329 - JACKIE...
LET ME TALK.\\
330 - YEAH, HYDE,
LET HER TALK.\\
331 - OKAY, LOOK, IT'S JUST...\\
332 - OKAY, I'VE BEEN HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME\\
333 - SINCE MY DAD'S BEEN IN JAIL
THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR ANYTHING\\
334 - THAT JUST MIGHT MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.\\
335 - MRS. FORMAN, IT'S LIKE YOU
WITH YOUR MENOPAUSE\\
336 - AND ALL THAT WINE
YOU'RE ALWAYS DRINKIN'.\\
337 - WELL...\\
338 - YOU SHUT
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE MOUTH.\\
339 - NOW, STEVEN, YOU TELL ME
THE TRUTH RIGHT NOW.\\
340 - IS THIS YOURS OR NOT?\\
341 - MRS. FORMAN, I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH. IT'S NOT MINE.\\
342 - OKAY. FINE.\\
343 - WELL, I DON'T CARE WHOSE IT IS.
I'M THROWING IT IN THE LAKE.\\
344 - I PAID 20 BUCKS FOR THAT.\\
345 - YOU GOT MY PARENTS' NUMBER.\\
346 - THAT'LL TEACH YOU
TO SELL ME OUT,\\
347 - YOU SON OF A BITCH!\\
348 - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO.\\
349 - SO I SNUCK UP HERE
BEHIND YOUR BACK,\\
350 - WE HAVE A HUGE FIGHT,\\
351 - AND THEN YOU DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR ME.\\
352 - IT'S LIKE WHEN THE GRINCH
STOLE CHRISTMAS,\\
353 - BUT ALL THE LITTLE WHOS
SANG ANYWAY.\\
354 - I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST WHAT PEOPLE DO\\
355 - FOR THE PEOPLE
THEY CARE ABOUT.\\
356 - NOBODY I EVER KNEW.\\
357 - THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU WERE POOR,
AND POOR PEOPLE ARE BAD.\\
358 - BUT... LOOK, IT'S LIKE WHAT
I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.\\
359 - I SENSED YOU WERE
IN TROUBLE,\\
360 - AND I LOOKED FOR A WAY
TO HELP YOU\\
361 - WITHOUT YOU HAVING
TO ASK ME.\\
362 - JACKIE, TO BE FAIR,
YOU HEARD RED SAY,\\
363 - "HYDE, YOU'RE OUT
OF THE HOUSE,"\\
364 - NOT "HYDE, YOU'RE GOING
TO A DOLL EXPO."\\
365 - WELL, ANYWAY, THANK YOU.\\
366 - OH, SO YOU CAN YOU
HELP ME\\
367 - MOVE THE MIRROR
IN THE BATHROOM?\\
368 - WHAT MIRROR?\\
369 - THE ONE COVERING UP
THE WINDOW.\\
370 - WELL, THAT WAS
A GREAT TRIP.\\
371 - YEAH, CAN'T WAIT
TO DO IT AGAIN.\\
372 - OKAY, OKAY.\\
373 - DONNA, I THINK I MAY HAVE
OVERREACTED A LITTLE BIT.\\
374 - I MEAN, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF TWINKIES IN THE WORLD.\\
375 - I MEAN, SURE, THERE WAS
ONLY ONE IN THE CAR,\\
376 - AND YOU DID GO GODZILLA
ON IT.\\
377 - BUT...\\
378 - LOOK, I'M SORRY.\\
379 - WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,\\
380 - IT DIDN'T TASTE
VERY GOOD.\\
381 - I THINK IT WAS
A KNOCKOFF.\\
382 - YEAH, MY MOM BUYS
TWONKIES.\\
383 - LOOK, DONNA, WE HAD A GOAL
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS TRIP.\\
384 - WE WERE GONNA BE ROMANTIC
IN SOMEPLACE NEW AND DIFFERENT,\\
385 - AND I AM A MAN WHO LIKES
TO FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.\\
386 - SO MAY I SUGGEST...\\
387 - ON MY KITCHEN TABLE?\\
388 - YOU KNOW WHAT? OKAY.\\
389 - ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YOUR PARENTS
WON'T BE HOME UNTIL TOMORROW.\\
390 - OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE GOING FOR THIS?\\
391 - OKAY. OKAY.\\
392 - GREAT.\\
393 - WHAT THE HELL
WAS IN THAT TWONKIE?\\
394 - DO YOU BELIEVE THAT KID?\\
395 - FIRST, HE DOESN'T SHOW UP,
THEN HE BLOCKS THE DRIVEWAY.\\
396 - WELL, I WILL JUST BE HAPPY\\
397 - TO GET BACK
IN OUR NICE, QUIET HOUSE.\\
398 - OH, MY GOD!\\
399 - ALL RIGHT!
IT'S DONNA'S BUTT!\\
400 - DAMN IT! THAT'S WHERE
I EAT DINNER!\\
401 - SCRUB, DAMN IT!\\
402 - I AM SCRUBBING
AS HARD AS I CAN.\\
403 - THIS CLEANSER
ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH.\\
404 - KITTY, IT'S BLEACH
AND LIGHTER FLUID.\\
405 - THERE IS NOTHING STRONGER.\\
406 - WELL, IT IS NOT
STRONG ENOUGH!\\
407 - NOPE, NO GOOD.
WE NEED A NEW TABLE.
\subsection {Episode 13: Your Time Is Gonna Come}
1 - Okay, Fez, now remember.
The bra wants to come off.\\
2 - It can't be forced.
It has to be coaxed.\\
3 - And go.\\
4 - And they are out!\\
5 - Eight seconds! That's a new
foreign exchange student record!\\
6 - And I think she liked it.\\
7 - Okay, Fez, that was really good.\\
8 - But remember, the real girl will
have a head and, hopefully, arms.\\
9 - Hey, guys. Have I got
a surprise for me.\\
10 - Annette!\\
11 - Yeah, Annette came all the way
from California to visit me\\
12 - because we're in love.\\
13 - Yeah, since Hyde
stole my old girlfriend.\\
14 - That's him.\\
15 - Then I remembered Annette,
and, well, I gave her a call.\\
16 - And one thing led to...
Well, hello there.\\
17 - So, Annette, when you
get bored with this one,\\
18 - I can take off
a bra in eight seconds.\\
19 - Well, maybe more,
if you fight me.\\
20 - All right, back off, Fez. What
me and Annette have is real.\\
21 - Which is amazing
because I even told him\\
22 - that I used to be flat-chested
and have a different nose.\\
23 - Yeah, and I figured she looks
okay now, so what the hell?\\
24 - So, anyway, Annette,
you'll be staying with Donna.\\
25 - What?\\
26 - No, no, it'll be fun. It'll be like
having a giant Barbie to play with.\\
27 - Yeah. I mean, come on, Donna,\\
28 - you guys were such
great friends in California.\\
29 - Friends? The most I
ever said to her was,\\
30 - "Yeah, those probably do hurt
when they're sunburned."\\
31 - Well, I need
someplace to stash her.\\
32 - Hey, I got
a footlocker in my room.\\
33 - Please, Donna.
I already had to\\
34 - take a shower at Michael's house\\
35 - and one of his brothers
took a picture of me.\\
36 - Kelso, I thought all your
brothers were out of the house.\\
37 - Must've been a burglar.\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - So, that's the tramp Michael
fooled around with in California.\\
48 - But the nerve of him
bringing her into The Hub.\\
49 - I mean, people eat here.\\
50 - Hey, will you stop talking about\\
51 - how jealous you are
of Kelso's new chick?\\
52 - Oh, I am not jealous.\\
53 - But I would like to
point out that the sign\\
54 - on the door says,
"No dogs allowed."\\
55 - Donna, can we go to your house?\\
56 - I have to change into
my afternoon outfit.\\
57 - Gauchos and clogs.\\
58 - Bravo.\\
59 - You have an afternoon outfit?\\
60 - Of course she does.\\
61 - You can maybe use a little
freshening up, too, Big D.\\
62 - Eric, do you mind?\\
63 - I'm on it.\\
64 - Donna!\\
65 - Why don't I meet
you guys by the car?\\
66 - Come on, Michael. While we're
waiting, I'll let you smell my hair.\\
67 - Yeah, well, I just
got these fries.\\
68 - Fine. Then I'll go flirt
with the gas-station guy.\\
69 - Fine!\\
70 - God. How hot was that?\\
71 - Wow.\\
72 - You know when you
have a dirty dream?\\
73 - Well, Annette is
the girl who's always in it.\\
74 - Oh, she should be ashamed
of what she has done to me.\\
75 - I don't know. I didn't
mind her in California,\\
76 - but now that she's got her hooks
in Kelso, something's different.\\
77 - Yeah. Something evil.\\
78 - I just can't put
my finger on it.\\
79 - Michael, I'm waiting!\\
80 - I was getting you
a Super Ball. Damn!\\
81 - I told you, I don't
like presents that bounce.\\
82 - Did you hear that? The
shrill voice. The bossy tone.\\
83 - The random hatred
of all things that bounce.\\
84 - Oh, my God.\\
85 - She's Jackie.\\
86 - A new Jackie.\\
87 - A blonde Jackie.\\
88 - Blackie.\\
89 - We are doomed.\\
90 - Well, I can't spend the
night alone with that.\\
91 - Jackie, you have to
sleep in my house.\\
92 - Ooh! Good idea.\\
93 - Put both Jackies
in the same room,\\
94 - toss some
lipstick in the middle,\\
95 - watch them tear
each other to shreds.\\
96 - No. No, no. I don't
wanna sleep over.\\
97 - Well, I don't like her.\\
98 - Come on.\\
99 - We'll do, like, girlie things. It'll be
like a pyjama party with makeovers.\\
100 - Donna, I'm not interested
in stupid girlie things.\\
101 - Look, I'm not shallow anymore.\\
102 - Don't do that when I'm eating.\\
103 - Jackie, come on.
You'll have all night\\
104 - to chip away at her self-esteem.\\
105 - We can whisper
about her and then when\\
106 - she asks us what we
were talking about\\
107 - we can giggle
and say, "Nothing."\\
108 - Oh, wait, I've done that to you.\\
109 - That's where I got it.\\
110 - Okay. Okay. Here's what I think
would teach her a good lesson.\\
111 - Dress her up like a Swiss
mountain girl, us fellas will come over,\\
112 - make a couple of daiquiris, get
a little tipsy, see what happens.\\
113 - What? Okay.\\
114 - That's not a very good punishment.
We should spank her, too.\\
115 - I don't hear any kids.\\
116 - They're at The Hub.\\
117 - So, we have
the house to ourselves.\\
118 - Interesting.\\
119 - Don't open it.
I'll throw in a foot massage.\\
120 - It could be The Franklin Mint.\\
121 - I ordered those Gone
With the Wind plates.\\
122 - Mom, Daddy.\\
123 - I told you not to open it.\\
124 - What are you doing here?\\
125 - Well, we just thought
we'd drop by.\\
126 - You came all the way
from Phoenix just to drop by.\\
127 - Oh! So you're lost and you
need directions back home.\\
128 - That's no problem.
Go south until you see cactus.\\
129 - If you hit a guy with a
sombrero, you've gone too far.\\
130 - Okay.\\
131 - Okay.\\
132 - Why are you really here?\\
133 - Well, we had
a reversal of fortune.\\
134 - Tell them what happened.\\
135 - I bought an ostrich farm.\\
136 - Tell them what else happened.\\
137 - It was next to a coyote farm.\\
138 - Great story.
See you at Christmas.\\
139 - He lost all our money.\\
140 - We had to sell the house in
Phoenix, which is why we're here.\\
141 - An ostrich farm, Burt?\\
142 - Who the hell wants
to eat an ostrich?\\
143 - Coyotes, apparently.\\
144 - You see what I live with?\\
145 - Well, I'm sure Daddy was just
doing what he thought was best.\\
146 - You could show
him some sympathy.\\
147 - Him? What about me?\\
148 - It's always difficult
for the beautiful women.\\
149 - You never
understood that, Kitty.\\
150 - Jackie's acting
really strange, man.\\
151 - I think she doesn't like
Kelso having a new chick.\\
152 - No. Jackie's acting strange
because Jackie hates Annette,\\
153 - because Jackie and Annette
are the same person.\\
154 - And that's scary, 'cause there can
only be one devil, one Hitler, one...\\
155 - Darth Vader.\\
156 - That's not it. Something's
going on, and I don't like it.\\
157 - Like, you think maybe she
still has feelings for Kelso?\\
158 - I don't know, but it's bad, man.\\
159 - I get the same feeling I get
right before I shoplift something.\\
160 - Oh, it's an old story.\\
161 - Orphan boy falls for rich girl.\\
162 - Doofus shows up with whore.\\
163 - Rich girl goes back to doofus.\\
164 - Fez consoles whore, sexually.\\
165 - And orphan boy ends up alone,
slowly going blind from self-abuse.\\
166 - Too far?\\
167 - I had a feeling it was too far.\\
168 - What are you guys
doing sitting down here\\
169 - when the girls are having a
pyjama party right next door?\\
170 - Oh, I can just imagine
what's going on over there.\\
171 - No, no, Fez. I got this one.\\
172 - I know.
Let's have a pillow fight.\\
173 - Even though it's hard to do when
I'm encumbered by all these clothes.\\
174 - Jackie, take off my nightie.\\
175 - Not yet.
I wanna practice kissing.\\
176 - Just kissing? Or can we rub
up against each other, too?\\
177 - Well, Annette, you can't
have one without the other.\\
178 - Yay!\\
179 - You know, it occurs to me\\
180 - that you can see right into
Donna's house from my driveway.\\
181 - You don't say?\\
182 - I'm gonna go get
some Cracker Jacks.\\
183 - She's so cheap, she
could be the prize in the Cracker Jacks.\\
184 - Wow. You're jealous.\\
185 - I am not jealous.\\
186 - I just wanna pop
that inflatable bitch\\
187 - and watch her fly
around the room.\\
188 - Look, here's the thing, Jackie.\\
189 - Kelso likes bossy, vain,
shallow princess types,\\
190 - and since you're
no longer available,\\
191 - he shipped one in from out west.\\
192 - He's not supposed to replace me.\\
193 - He's supposed to sit around
and pine for me.\\
194 - You can't have your
cake and eat it, too.\\
195 - Oh, my God! It is always
about food with you.\\
196 - It's like you're
not even listening.\\
197 - Okay. New rule for
slumber parties,\\
198 - Annette wears a robe.\\
199 - No, Annette, not the robe.\\
200 - Quick. Somebody yell,
"Pillow fight," in a girl voice.\\
201 - Forman, that's your cue.\\
202 - What are you boys looking at?\\
203 - We're just
testing out the crates.\\
204 - For charity.\\
205 - Right. But now that we're
done, let's head inside, gang.\\
206 - You coming?\\
207 - No, I told your grandmother I
was coming outside for a cigarette.\\
208 - Grandpa, you smoke?\\
209 - Nope.\\
210 - So...\\
211 - So did you guys
hear about that woman\\
212 - who might be the first female
member of the Supreme Court?\\
213 - No.\\
214 - But I did hear
the Dallas Cowboys might\\
215 - hire their first
redheaded cheerleader.\\
216 - Ew!\\
217 - That's exactly what I said.\\
218 - Uh-oh.
Redhead in the room.\\
219 - What are you guys talking about?\\
220 - Nothing.\\
221 - Burt.\\
222 - Burtikins.\\
223 - Burt!\\
224 - Eric, would you please go
find your grandfather\\
225 - before my head explodes?\\
226 - You are all such nice boys. I
have a quarter for each one of you.\\
227 - Thanks, Grandma B.\\
228 - Someone call an ambulance.
What's wrong?\\
229 - Grandpa's on the ground.
He's not moving.\\
230 - They got ice cream
in the cafeteria!\\
231 - Ice cream? Kelso, my
grandpa's in Intensive Care.\\
232 - Yeah, but I told them
it was my grandfather\\
233 - so I got the ice cream for free.\\
234 - Put it down.\\
235 - Fine, but when my burrito's
ready, I'm eating it.\\
236 - Why does everybody
go everywhere with us?\\
237 - Look at all these damn kids.\\
238 - I feel like a Mormon.\\
239 - Man, I feel like we should
know something by now.\\
240 - That is the third coffee break
that doctor's had.\\
241 - Hey, buddy! Quit the coffee!
Fix the sickies, all right?\\
242 - Hey, who took my ice cream?\\
243 - Oh, sure, it's always
the foreign guy.\\
244 - Fez, you're holding the spoon.\\
245 - Oh, sure, it's always the
foreign guy with the spoon.\\
246 - Kitty, how's Burt?\\
247 - Well...\\
248 - I don't know how to say this.\\
249 - Daddy's gone to a better place.\\
250 - Good. 'Cause this
hospital sucks.\\
251 - What?\\
252 - Oh.\\
253 - This hospital sucks.\\
254 - Mrs. Forman,
I'm so sorry for your loss.\\
255 - The service was lovely.\\
256 - Aw, geez.\\
257 - Aw, geez.\\
258 - Aw...
We got it, Bob.\\
259 - Mom, how you doing?\\
260 - Oh, I'm fine.\\
261 - Mom.\\
262 - Your husband, my father,
is gone. You're not fine.\\
263 - You're right. I think I chipped
a tooth on your manicotti.\\
264 - When I die, get a caterer.\\
265 - Hey, man.
Sorry about your grandpa.\\
266 - I didn't know him,\\
267 - but there's a Carly Simon song
that always cheers me up.\\
268 - No, you don't have to...\\
269 - I haven't got
time for the pain\\
270 - I haven't
the room for the pain\\
271 - I haven't
the need for the pain\\
272 - Oh, that's great.\\
273 - Anymore\\
274 - What do I do?
Do I clap?\\
275 - I'm just gonna walk away.\\
276 - That was awesome.\\
277 - Do you know Devil
Went Down to Georgia?\\
278 - No, Michael. She's
got better things to do.\\
279 - Hey, come on! Let's
go try on people's coats.\\
280 - So, the rich girl
goes off with the whore.\\
281 - That's a happy ending.\\
282 - Put it on ice and you
got yourself a show.\\
283 - Yeah, so Jackie and
Annette are friends now?\\
284 - I guess I don't have anything
to worry about then.\\
285 - Never count Kelso out.
He's got a way about him.\\
286 - You know, when he talks to you,\\
287 - it's like you're
the only one in the room.\\
288 - You're, like, half in love
with him, aren't you?\\
289 - Hey, Eric, I brought
you half a beer.\\
290 - Well, it's mixed with half a
Coke, 'cause Red caught me.\\
291 - So, are you okay?\\
292 - Yeah. I guess.\\
293 - Hey, thanks for coming.\\
294 - I'm really sorry
about your grandfather.\\
295 - I mean, right in
your own driveway?\\
296 - What was he doing
out there anyway?\\
297 - Oh, he caught us spying
on your slumber party.\\
298 - Wait, you were
spying on us? Eric!\\
299 - Okay, if anyone should
be mad, it should be us,\\
300 - because, lady, you do not know
how to throw a slumber party.\\
301 - Flannel pyjamas?
What are you, 100?\\
302 - Do you need a nightie?
I'll buy you a nightie.\\
303 - So, am I allowed to drink
around you guys yet?\\
304 - Eric, put that back. That's
your mother's emergency wine.\\
305 - So, Mom, you haven't said much.\\
306 - Are you holding it in? 'Cause
it's okay to let it out. We're family.\\
307 - If anybody needs to let anything
out, I'd be happy to leave.\\
308 - It's just so typical of Burt\\
309 - to make everyone come up from
Phoenix in the middle of winter.\\
310 - He never thought about anybody but
himself and those damned ostriches.\\
311 - Did you hear that?\\
312 - That is not grieving.\\
313 - Okay, Kitty. Calm down.\\
314 - It's not as bad as you think.
Maybe you're just having a hot flash.\\
315 - Oh!\\
316 - Dad!\\
317 - No!\\
318 - Eric,\\
319 - I need you to get to the wine.\\
320 - My father's thoughtless!
I'll tell her who's thoughtless.\\
321 - What is it?\\
322 - I, uh...\\
323 - Just wanted to see if you
wanted another blanket.\\
324 - Yes, that would
be very nice. Thank you.\\
325 - Hey, Mom, Dad wanted
me to give you this.\\
326 - Donna, great news.
I'm not jealous of Annette.\\
327 - I mean, I thought I was,
and I was afraid\\
328 - that I might still
have feelings for Michael.\\
329 - But I got to know her
and now I really like her.\\
330 - That is such a
relief, because, you know,\\
331 - what with Burt dying,
I was worried about you.\\
332 - Yeah, me, too.\\
333 - That was sarcasm.\\
334 - Well, whatever it was,
it was very thoughtful.\\
335 - It is such a relief knowing I
don't have feelings for Michael.\\
336 - Get off my boyfriend!\\
337 - Oh, yeah!\\
338 - I don't know why she's so
upset. I was barely touching you.\\
339 - Okay. This one's for Burt.\\
340 - And a-one and a-two and a...\\
341 - Amazing grace\\
342 - How sweet the sound\\
343 - That saved
a wretch like me\\
344 - Bring it home, brother!\\
345 - I once was lost\\
346 - But now am found\\
347 - Was blind, but now...\\
348 - Night-night.
\subsection {Episode 14: Babe I'm Gonna Leave You}
1 - Okay, let me get this straight.\\
2 - After my grandpa's funeral,
Kelso and Annette are making out.\\
3 - Jackie sees them and yells,
"Get off my boyfriend"?\\
4 - Right in front of you?\\
5 - Yeah, it brought
the whole funeral way down.\\
6 - Hyde, that's horrible, man.\\
7 - You know what's even worse?
I totally missed it.\\
8 - Yeah? Well, nobody
else missed it.\\
9 - Half the freaking town
was there.\\
10 - Man, today at The Hub, you know\\
11 - that kid Jimmy
with the headgear?\\
12 - He said he felt bad for me.\\
13 - Jimmy Headgear felt bad for me!\\
14 - I knew it was
a mistake hooking up\\
15 - with Jackie and I did it anyway.\\
16 - You know why?
'Cause she makes you stupid.\\
17 - I bet Kelso was composing
symphonies before her.\\
18 - Hyde. Man, I just
wanted to say I'm sorry,\\
19 - 'cause what Jackie did to you
was embarrassing.\\
20 - I mean, you must be
so embarrassed.\\
21 - I told a lot of
people what happened\\
22 - and they all agreed that it was\\
23 - just really embarrassing.\\
24 - Kelso, now is not the time.\\
25 - No, I just wanna
buck our boy up,\\
26 - 'cause what happened to him
was so embarrassing!\\
27 - That's it. I'm gonna kick
your ass. Forman, hold my...\\
28 - Whoa, whoa! Okay, you know
what? Why don't we go upstairs?\\
29 - We got that new J.C.
Penney catalog.\\
30 - There's a full-color
section on bras.\\
31 - Word has it the airbrush guy
totally missed a nipple.\\
32 - I don't know why he's so mad.
I was just being sensitive!\\
33 - Well, be sensitive to me
because I'm upset, too.\\
34 - If you expect me to go to
the Valentine's dance tonight,\\
35 - you're gonna have to do
a few things for me.\\
36 - For you, or to you?\\
37 - Shut up! One.
You will not speak to Jackie.\\
38 - Two.
You will not speak to girls\\
39 - who have brown hair like Jackie.\\
40 - Three. You will not
speak to Jackie.\\
41 - Wait.\\
42 - I got messed up.\\
43 - Yeah, baby,
whatever you want. Just...\\
44 - Man, it's great being under
someone's thumb again!\\
45 - What did your mother do to you?\\
46 - Man, I just feel bad for Hyde.\\
47 - I mean, Annette wants me.
Jackie wants me.\\
48 - I mean, my good looks
are ruining people's lives.\\
49 - Well, Hyde seems pretty mad.\\
50 - Whatever,
man, I'm not afraid of him.\\
51 - He got away!\\
52 - Help me!\\
53 - So, have you talked to
Hyde about\\
54 - the whole "Get off my
boyfriend" disaster?\\
55 - No. And why is everyone
making such a big deal about it?\\
56 - It's like every time I walk into a
room, people look at me funny.\\
57 - Donna, how do you deal with it?\\
58 - Jackie, the reason people
are making a big deal about it\\
59 - is because it sounds like you
still have feelings for Kelso.\\
60 - Well, I don't.\\
61 - I think the only
reason I said it\\
62 - was because I was having
an allergic reaction\\
63 - to the Formans'
cheap generic soda.\\
64 - Oh, no!
A giant redhead!\\
65 - Please don't crush me! Please!\\
66 - Fez, would you
stop screwing around?\\
67 - Now, did you finish the
balloon walkway of love yet?\\
68 - You bet I did.\\
69 - When Nina sees it,
she's gonna be so impressed,\\
70 - her balloons will
become my walkway\\
71 - of love,
if you know what I mean.\\
72 - Fez, that's disgusting.\\
73 - Oh,
no, the giant's angry!\\
74 - Run for your lives! Run! Run!\\
75 - Hanging out\\
76 - Down the street\\
77 - The same old thing\\
78 - We did last week\\
79 - Not a thing to do\\
80 - But talk to you\\
81 - We're all all right\\
82 - We're all all right\\
83 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
84 - Mrs. Forman,
this chili is great.\\
85 - Thanks.\\
86 - Daddy used to love my chili.
Remember, Mom?\\
87 - I remember it
gave him the toots.\\
88 - Well, that's a nice place
to start the reminiscing.\\
89 - So, Eric, are you excited about
your big Valentine's dance?\\
90 - Yeah. I'm just
glad it's in the gym.\\
91 - There's nothing like celebrating\\
92 - the most romantic
night of your life\\
93 - in the room where I
got my first wedgie.\\
94 - It meant I liked you, Eric.\\
95 - If you don't mind, I'd like
to talk about my father.\\
96 - Well, Kitty, we can dwell on what
was, or we can talk about what is.\\
97 - If I've learned anything
from losing my Burtie Bear,\\
98 - it's that all
that really matters\\
99 - is making sure that the people
we love know we love them.\\
100 - Mom, that was wonderful.\\
101 - I mean it.\\
102 - Eric, I love you.\\
103 - Oh. Well, thanks, Grandma.\\
104 - Kitty...\\
105 - I think I'll go for a walk.\\
106 - Well, this was fun.\\
107 - I'm gonna go to
bed for a few days.\\
108 - Oh, no.\\
109 - She hasn't done this since
Elvis died on the crapper.\\
110 - Now I've gotta sit by
her bed for four days\\
111 - and tell her that
she's beautiful.\\
112 - It's hard to say that to a
cold-cream-smeared loony in bunny slippers.\\
113 - I remember that week.
The shades were drawn.\\
114 - The food supply ran low.\\
115 - We were sucking on bouillon
cubes just to stay alive.\\
116 - Yeah, but did you hear
what your grandma said\\
117 - about love being the
only thing that matters?\\
118 - Eric, we should tell
her that we're engaged.\\
119 - What?\\
120 - Well, she could be the one
person who'd be happy for us.\\
121 - We're gonna need someone on
our side when we tell our families.\\
122 - Yeah. And you know what?\\
123 - Even if she's not on our side, the
minute Grandma thinks it's a bad idea,\\
124 - my mom will be booking the
big room at the Holiday Inn\\
125 - just out of spite.\\
126 - So, it's a win-win.
Yeah.\\
127 - We're gonna do what Luke
Skywalker was too afraid to do.\\
128 - Use the dark side
to our advantage.\\
129 - Eric, if we're gonna be married,\\
130 - you've really gotta ease up
on the Star Wars stuff.\\
131 - All right? It doesn't
apply to everything.\\
132 - I'm gonna have to
rewrite my vows.\\
133 - My favorite song?\\
134 - The Most Beautiful
Girl In The World.\\
135 - The light I look best in?\\
136 - It's a tie between
20-watt, soft-pink bulbs\\
137 - and mid-summer sunset.\\
138 - Very good, Michael.\\
139 - God, I missed this.\\
140 - Oh, hey.
Have you guys seen Steven?\\
141 - I hear a weird, piercing noise,\\
142 - but I don't know
where it's coming from.\\
143 - Do you hear anything, Michael?\\
144 - Yeah, it's just Jackie.\\
145 - Jackie, I'm sorry you have
to see me in this T-shirt.\\
146 - I know how it emphasizes
my hunkalicious bod.\\
147 - Shut up, Michael, okay? I made
a stupid slip. It meant nothing.\\
148 - Right, because
Michael is my boyfriend.\\
149 - I know he is, skankwad.\\
150 - Oh, I'm a skankwad?\\
151 - Girl fight! Let's get it on!\\
152 - We are not gonna fight.\\
153 - Well, maybe you
should kiss and make up.\\
154 - Let's get it on!\\
155 - What? What? Wait.\\
156 - Ah, I'll go with the blonde.\\
157 - Kitty, I'm just going to the
corner to get you some soup.\\
158 - I'm not leaving you for somebody
younger and less dramatic.\\
159 - This is your fault.\\
160 - If I wanna get my wife out of
bed, I gotta tie a rope around her\\
161 - and attach it to my bumper
and pull her out like a stump.\\
162 - So, what were you saying, dear?\\
163 - Well, I was saying
that I'm getting married.\\
164 - Oh, honey, how wonderful!\\
165 - So, who's the lucky girl?\\
166 - Well...\\
167 - Donna.
Oh.\\
168 - Well, I guess this is
a small town.\\
169 - Okay, what the hell
did that mean?\\
170 - That, my friend, is the seldom
heard but much feared Grandma burn.\\
171 - Your only warning is the
jingle of costume jewelry\\
172 - and the overpowering
scent of Bengay.\\
173 - Well, you and Jackie
are certainly a mess.\\
174 - I remember before Nina,
when my love life was a mess.\\
175 - It's perfect now, though. Not
like yours, which is a mess.\\
176 - Steven, I've called three
times in the last half-hour.\\
177 - Yeah, I figured it was you
'cause all the calls came\\
178 - during the commercials
in The Newlywed Game.\\
179 - So, what? Now you're
not taking my calls?\\
180 - Why are you making
such a big deal about this?\\
181 - Because it is a big deal when
you yell, "Get off my boyfriend,"\\
182 - to a girl who's on
someone who's not me.\\
183 - Steven,
I cannot be held responsible\\
184 - for the things that
come out of my mouth.\\
185 - It didn't mean anything.\\
186 - So, that's your story?
"It didn't mean anything?"\\
187 - Right. Right. So, you
just need to get over it.\\
188 - Oh, yeah.
Don't worry, I'm over it.\\
189 - In fact, I'm over you.\\
190 - Wait, Steven,
what are you saying?\\
191 - He's saying he's breaking up with
you. Are you not paying attention?\\
192 - Because I'm on the edge
of my freaking seat here.\\
193 - Steven?\\
194 - So, I have a girlfriend
and you don't.\\
195 - So, my grandma doesn't think
Donna's good enough for me.\\
196 - How great is that?\\
197 - Finally, someone thinks
Donna's the lucky one.\\
198 - No more,
"Hey, how'd he get her?"\\
199 - Or, "Oh, that skinny guy
must really be rich."\\
200 - Yeah, that's right. I heard the
whispers. I just pretended not to.\\
201 - Who was whispering?
We said it right to you.\\
202 - Well, I'm done with Jackie,\\
203 - and I feel like a guy who had
a 95-pound mole removed.\\
204 - A 95-pound, Donny Osmond-loving,\\
205 - shoe-shopping,
Ice Capade-attending mole.\\
206 - Hyde, I know that's just coming\\
207 - from a place of deep, deep pain.\\
208 - And I really do feel bad that my
foxitude broke you and Jackie up.\\
209 - And I'd tone it down,
but I just don't know how!\\
210 - Guys, I'm worried
there's some unfinished\\
211 - business between
Michael and Jackie.\\
212 - When they were together,
did she make him happy?\\
213 - Well, she totally dominated him\\
214 - and made him feel
bad about himself.\\
215 - I guess what I'm asking is,
was she ever fat or anything?\\
216 - Eric, how can your grandmother
not like me?\\
217 - Ooh! Maybe I should wear my
Catholic school uniform around her more.\\
218 - You know,
people like me in that.\\
219 - Well, guys mostly.\\
220 - But, hey, give it a shot.
Grandmas have secrets, too.\\
221 - Donna, Steven broke up with me.\\
222 - Oh. Jackie, I'm sorry.\\
223 - Hey, maybe he just wanted you to be able to
spend more time with your other boyfriend.\\
224 - Shut up, Eric!\\
225 - Oh!\\
226 - It's you.\\
227 - Didn't know they
let slutballs in here.\\
228 - Well, I've seen you in here,
so I figured it was okay.\\
229 - Oh, you don't know it,
but you just burned yourself.\\
230 - Oh, I know it.
The question is, do you?\\
231 - I just said I do.\\
232 - So do I, so you are, too.\\
233 - Donna, you following this?\\
234 - I think one of them's a slutball
and one of them knows it.\\
235 - I think what we need to do is
go talk about Michael.\\
236 - Fine. I'll try to use small words
so you can understand me.\\
237 - That's not gonna be good enough.\\
238 - Hey, Grandma.\\
239 - Good afternoon,
Mrs. Sigurdson.\\
240 - Nice day, huh?\\
241 - No. It's raining, and
my arthritis is kicking up.\\
242 - What a coincidence. Mine, too.\\
243 - Boy, am I getting old.\\
244 - Not too old, you know.
Whatever you are.\\
245 - Wow. Hey, Grandma,
Donna brought you some salsa.\\
246 - Yep, Donna makes
the best darn salsa\\
247 - outside of your beloved Arizona.\\
248 - It's a reflection of her long-time
love affair with the Southwest.\\
249 - Much like your own.
Go, Grand Canyon!\\
250 - So, Eric, who are
you seeing these days?\\
251 - Okay.\\
252 - Okay, Grandma, you have
got to give Donna a chance.\\
253 - And I know you two
will get along famously.\\
254 - You have so much in common.\\
255 - Right. Like I love
eating dinner at 4:30, too.\\
256 - Look, Mrs. Sigurdson,
I love Eric with all my heart.\\
257 - And I know that
when you give me a chance,\\
258 - you'll see that
we're great together.\\
259 - Well, that's very sweet.
And you're right.\\
260 - I'm sure you're the
nicest girl Eric's met so far.\\
261 - She is just so good at that.\\
262 - See?\\
263 - Isn't it better
to be up and about\\
264 - than stuck in
your bed for a week?\\
265 - Well, this is better.\\
266 - Why did I even let
that woman get to me?\\
267 - I'm gonna go get
out of this robe.\\
268 - And take a shower.
I mean, that's the spirit!\\
269 - Your mother is a nutbag!\\
270 - What did she do?\\
271 - That thing where she
pretends to be nice,\\
272 - but she's really insulting you?\\
273 - Yes!
Frigid witch!\\
274 - I'll get the bed ready.\\
275 - How could she not like me?\\
276 - How can she not like me?\\
277 - You know what? Maybe she just
can't handle strong, healthy women.\\
278 - And I am strong and healthy.\\
279 - I bring home the bacon,
I fry it up in a pan and...\\
280 - I never, ever let
Red forget he's a man.\\
281 - Yeah.\\
282 - Well, I am not giving up on her.\\
283 - Oh, why are you worried?\\
284 - I'm the one who has to live
the rest of my life\\
285 - in the same
family with this woman.\\
286 - Yeah, but so do I.\\
287 - In the sense that\\
288 - we're all part of
the human family.\\
289 - Steven, I have to
tell you something.\\
290 - Well, if it's,
"Get off my boyfriend,"\\
291 - don't worry,
'cause I already heard it.\\
292 - No. Look, I have to
tell you, you were right.\\
293 - When I said that,
it did mean something.\\
294 - And I thought it didn't, because
sometimes I just want things\\
295 - because other people have them.\\
296 - Like once, I made my dad buy me a
pet rat because my cousin had one.\\
297 - But then the rat got so disgusting,
I made my kitty cat hunt it.\\
298 - I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.\\
299 - Who's the rat? Am I the rat?\\
300 - No.\\
301 - No. Steven.\\
302 - Look.
Okay, I spoke to Annette.\\
303 - And she made me realize that,\\
304 - okay, you know, maybe I do have\\
305 - some left-over
feelings for Michael.\\
306 - And then she said that if I
wanted him, I'd have to fight for him.\\
307 - But, Steven, I know in my heart\\
308 - the only person I
wanna fight for is you.\\
309 - Really? Oh, boy!\\
310 - You like Kelso, but you
like me a little bit more?\\
311 - What a bunch of crap!
You know what I think, Jackie?\\
312 - I think the only
reason you were with me\\
313 - in the first place was
to get back at Kelso.\\
314 - Steven, how can you say that?\\
315 - Okay, fine, you know what?
Maybe I do have feelings for Michael.\\
316 - But what am I supposed to do?
He was my first boyfriend.\\
317 - And you know what? You're
gonna have to learn to deal with it.\\
318 - And if you can't,
and you're gonna have\\
319 - to break up with
me because of that,\\
320 - then I can't stop you,
but I think\\
321 - it's a real waste,
because I love you!\\
322 - I'm not saying it back!\\
323 - I don't care.\\
324 - Damn it!\\
325 - So, are we gonna go
to the dance or what?\\
326 - Oh, Steven.\\
327 - Well, it looks like I'm just
in time for makeup sex.\\
328 - Don't mind me.
You'll barely hear me.\\
329 - If you prefer,
I can hide in the shower.\\
330 - Fez, get out of here.\\
331 - Okay, here I go.\\
332 - So, earlier today
I mentioned that\\
333 - I would like your balloons
to be my walkway of love.\\
334 - And you said, "Okay."\\
335 - Do you know what I meant?\\
336 - Because I don't want to
surprise you with this one.\\
337 - Well, I think you meant...\\
338 - That's it!\\
339 - Hey, look who's back together.\\
340 - What the hell?\\
341 - Come on, Jackie, let's dance.\\
342 - How can she be with him when
she's so clearly not over me?\\
343 - I think the question is,
how can you be with me\\
344 - when you're so
clearly not over her?\\
345 - Wait, is this a riddle?
Start over.\\
346 - You're obviously
still in love with Jackie.\\
347 - I'm going back to California.\\
348 - Baby, no!
I'll prove that I'm over her.\\
349 - I'll bet you 50 bucks that
if we do it, I'll be into it.\\
350 - Good-bye, Michael.\\
351 - Wait, but you win either way!\\
352 - Oh, I feel so much better.\\
353 - I am a strong, healthy woman
who doesn't need to go to bed\\
354 - every time some mean old lady
gives her a cross look.\\
355 - That's right.\\
356 - Good evening, Mother.\\
357 - Going out to dinner.\\
358 - Oh.\\
359 - Is that what you're wearing?\\
360 - I'll be in bed.
\subsection {Episode 15: When the Levee Breaks}
1 - And then I realized, that's
why they call it a clock radio.\\
2 - 'Cause it's got both.\\
3 - Hey, Donna. Feast your eyes.\\
4 - All new stuff for me and Joanne's
weekend away at tennis camp.\\
5 - Billie Jean King's sister is
leading the campfire songs.\\
6 - We're gonna make
quite the racket.\\
7 - Good one, Bob.\\
8 - Bob's going out of
town for the weekend?\\
9 - All right! Party at Donna's!\\
10 - Okay. We're gonna need beer,
balloons, and girls with low self-esteem.\\
11 - Guys, hang on. Donna and I
already made plans this weekend.\\
12 - Well, then just leave us a key, man.
And don't worry, if anything bad happens,\\
13 - I know how to make it look
like a robbery-homicide.\\
14 - Look, Eric and I
want one weekend alone\\
15 - where we don't have to be so
secretive about being engaged.\\
16 - I could even wear my ring if it
weren't being resized for me.\\
17 - Can they make a ring big enough
to fit your Paul Bunyan hands?\\
18 - - Jackie?
- Well, I'm sorry, Donna.\\
19 - But if you're not gonna have a
party, you're gonna get insulted.\\
20 - It's just the way it is.\\
21 - The way I see it, unless Donna's
blocking the door with her giant hands,\\
22 - we're coming over for a party.\\
23 - Oh-oh. We should get one of
those girls that jump out of cakes.\\
24 - Yeah. They're great.\\
25 - You know, you two could do
a little less standing around\\
26 - and a little more
jumping out of cakes.\\
27 - Morning.\\
28 - Hey, Dad, I was thinking of spending
tonight and tomorrow over at Fez's.\\
29 - At whose's?\\
30 - The foreign boy with the tight
pants, wears a little too much cologne.\\
31 - I don't like him.\\
32 - I caught him stealing bacon
out of our fridge.\\
33 - Why are you doing your
homework in the morning?\\
34 - I was out last night with Donna.\\
35 - Well, of course you were. That's why
you came in a half-hour past the curfew.\\
36 - Oh, well, Donna had a flat.\\
37 - Aw! That's awful bad luck.\\
38 - Seeing how Donna
doesn't have a car.\\
39 - I see you getting bigger,\\
40 - but you still act
like a 12-year-old.\\
41 - Now, when are you gonna grow up
and start thinking about your future?\\
42 - Red, don't get upset so early.\\
43 - You won't enjoy
your sausage and Tang.\\
44 - Sausage and Tang? Is...\\
45 - Is that a little
racy for breakfast?\\
46 - I don't get it.\\
47 - Well, I'm gonna leave
before someone explains it.\\
48 - Good morning.\\
49 - Steven, you got a big
tear in that jacket.\\
50 - Yeah. It's hard hopping over
a fence carrying two 12-packs.\\
51 - I mean, library books.\\
52 - Well, I'm gonna ignore that,\\
53 - 'cause you don't even have
parents to buy you a new coat.\\
54 - He doesn't have parents, Eric.\\
55 - He told me that sometimes
when he's all alone, he cries.\\
56 - Oh, that settles it. I'm taking
you shopping for a new coat.\\
57 - Here, here.
Take some Tang and go.\\
58 - Man, if I had a dollar for every
time I heard a chick say that...\\
59 - What?\\
60 - What? Never turn down Tang.
Growing boys need Tang.\\
61 - What is funny here?\\
62 - Hanging out\\
63 - Down the street\\
64 - The same old thing\\
65 - We did last week\\
66 - Not a thing to do\\
67 - But talk to you\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - We're all all right\\
70 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
71 - Oh, the plumber took apart the toilet
upstairs, so you'll have to use this one.\\
72 - - I know it's scary
down here at night, but...
- She'll be fine. Let's go.\\
73 - Just when you come
around that corner in the dark,\\
74 - that coat rack can
look like a bear.\\
75 - Finally,\\
76 - we're alone.\\
77 - For the whole weekend.\\
78 - All right! Party time!
I brought the Slip 'n Slide.\\
79 - - Let's move the couch.
- Okay. I'll get the hose.\\
80 - No, we don't need the hose,
man. We'll just use beer.\\
81 - - Kelso, are you nuts?
- You're right.\\
82 - We don't wanna waste the beer.
Go get the hose, man.\\
83 - No! Guys, we said, "No party."\\
84 - Oh, come on, Forman. Look,
man, you gotta help me out here.\\
85 - Jackie and I are going through
a really rough time,\\
86 - and maybe, just maybe,
we can start to heal\\
87 - if you can find it in your heart to
let me trash your girlfriend's house!\\
88 - - Don't care.
- But it's party time, man.\\
89 - I invited a girl in a halter-top
who was on her fifth beer.\\
90 - - Fifth beer! Halter-top!
- Forget it, Kelso.\\
91 - But do you know what a Slip
'n Slide can do to a halter-top?\\
92 - It turns it into a belt.\\
93 - - Hello?
- Hello, is Mr. Forman there?\\
94 - No, I'm sorry. You just missed
him. Can I take a message?\\
95 - Yes. This is Fenton
from All That Glitters.\\
96 - Mr. Forman bought a ring here,
and I'm calling to tell him it's ready.\\
97 - And, ah, oh, it looks fabulous.\\
98 - He bought me a ring?\\
99 - I hope it wasn't a surprise. Perhaps
you shouldn't know that I called.\\
100 - Could you let Mr. Forman know
that I called? I mean...\\
101 - You shouldn't know
that he bought you... Oh!\\
102 - Now I've made a messy. Okay.\\
103 - Okay, dinner is all ready.\\
104 - I just had to add
the secret ingredient: love.\\
105 - By the way, "love" is salt.\\
106 - All right.
Chicken Pinciotti for two.\\
107 - Is this red
stuff gravy or blood?\\
108 - There's no gravy.\\
109 - Oh. Well, I guess
it's just kind of moist then.\\
110 - Actually, it's kind of pink.
Is this ham?\\
111 - No, it's Chicken Pinciotti.\\
112 - Mine looks fine.\\
113 - Well, if you don't wanna eat
yours, we have some Fruity Pebbles.\\
114 - No... No. Grown-ups don't eat
Fruity Pebbles. They eat chicken.\\
115 - What grown-ups?\\
116 - Where are these grown-ups?\\
117 - Donna, us.\\
118 - The whole point of this weekend
is to prove that we're grown-up\\
119 - and that Red doesn't know what he's
talking about when he says I'm immature.\\
120 - It is? I don't know. I thought the
point of this weekend was to have,\\
121 - you know, a fun, light weekend.\\
122 - Yeah. No, it will be fun and light.
It's just that in the next 36 hours,\\
123 - I would like to prove to myself\\
124 - that my father's been wrong
about me my entire life,\\
125 - but in a fun, light way.\\
126 - Well, whatever. You don't
have to eat the chicken.\\
127 - No! What? No. Are you
kidding? I was kidding.\\
128 - I'm doing our grown-up, domestic
squabbling thing, you know?\\
129 - It's like,
I make fun of your cooking,\\
130 - you tell me to put on pants
when we have company.\\
131 - Are you gonna stop wearing your pants?
'Cause I might have a problem with that.\\
132 - See? Good, we're bickering,
like husband and wife.\\
133 - What, you call this dinner?\\
134 - Hey, take my wife, please.\\
135 - That's delicious.\\
136 - Steven, just come in.
Your jacket looks fine.\\
137 - Mrs. Forman, I don't think
this jacket's really my style.\\
138 - Oh, nonsense.\\
139 - Ever since I've know you, you've
been nothing but flash and pizzazz.\\
140 - Oh, and look,
it says "stuntman" on the arm.\\
141 - People are gonna think
you're from Hollywood.\\
142 - - Excuse me.
- Yes? Oh. Mmm-hmm.\\
143 - I was wondering if I might look at
that ring you called Mr. Forman about\\
144 - that he doesn't
know I know about yet.\\
145 - Oh. I don't think I'm supposed
to show you, but...\\
146 - But I do a lot of things behind
this counter I'm not supposed to do.\\
147 - So, hmm.\\
148 - This is an engagement ring.\\
149 - An engagement ring? Uh-oh.\\
150 - Why would Red give
me a diamond ring?\\
151 - Maybe it's a menopause diamond.\\
152 - You know, for a happy menopause.\\
153 - Oh, oh, it's engraved.
"To Donna..."\\
154 - You're a lucky woman, Donna.\\
155 - I mean, Mr. Forman seems
a tad young for you,\\
156 - but men and women are doing all
sorts of things we never used to do, hmm?\\
157 - Oh, my goodness!
This is from Eric to...\\
158 - Eric and Donna are engaged?\\
159 - Well, if they are, I'm learning
it here for the first time.\\
160 - So, Mr. Stuntman...\\
161 - Are you from Hollywood?\\
162 - I gotta tell you, this being grown-up
thing really seems to work for us.\\
163 - It's like we're already good
at being married.\\
164 - All we did was eat.\\
165 - Hey, a little secret
they don't tell you?\\
166 - That's all marriage is.\\
167 - Forman, listen.\\
168 - I just got back from the mall
with your mom.\\
169 - Nice coat, Hyde.\\
170 - Burt Reynolds
have a garage sale?\\
171 - Yeah, Hyde, Donna
and I are trying to be alone.\\
172 - We got no use for a shiny,
red stuntman.\\
173 - Look, would you shut
up and listen to me?\\
174 - No! Okay? This house
is closed to parties, okay?\\
175 - So just go away. Oh, and tell
the cast of Smokey and the Bandit\\
176 - that I said, "10-4."\\
177 - Fine. I'm gone, man.\\
178 - Don't you mean, "I'm eastbound
and down, good buddy"?\\
179 - What does a married couple do\\
180 - after a delicious dinner
of Chicken Pinciotti?\\
181 - Well, we could
make out on the couch,\\
182 - but we're married, so maybe
we should just fight and go to bed.\\
183 - - Whoa.
- What's wrong?\\
184 - Whoa!\\
185 - Okay, I think the Chicken
Pinciotti wants to fly the coop.\\
186 - Oh.\\
187 - I'm gonna be
upstairs for a little bit.\\
188 - Do you have any magazines
that I could... Whoa! Okay.\\
189 - I'll
just read the shampoo.\\
190 - Well, wait. You can't... You
can't use the bathroom upstairs.\\
191 - You have to use
the one off the den.\\
192 - Right in there?\\
193 - While
you're right in here?\\
194 - I can't do that.
You might sense something.\\
195 - I might sense something? How
much of a ruckus are you gonna make?\\
196 - What... I just...
I can't go here, okay?\\
197 - And I can't go home because
Red thinks I'm over at Fez's. What...\\
198 - I'm a man without a country.\\
199 - Eric, you wanted to
be grown-up. And...\\
200 - Well, this is something that
grown-ups do in the same house.\\
201 - No, I...
You know what I was thinking?\\
202 - I could build us another
house, a separate house.\\
203 - Eric, you're
talking about an outhouse.\\
204 - Well, it's about time
those made a comeback!\\
205 - Eric and Donna can't be
engaged. They're too young.\\
206 - How does something
like this happen?\\
207 - Well,
Eric asked her to marry him,\\
208 - and instead of saying, "Ew,"
like a normal person,\\
209 - Donna said yes.\\
210 - Well, I don't like
secret-keeping in my house.\\
211 - What else is going on
that I don't know about?\\
212 - Ooh. There is something else.\\
213 - In the back left
corner of Forman's closet,\\
214 - he has stashed some highly
offensive photographic material.\\
215 - Well, this has gotta stop.\\
216 - Eric should have told me
about his engagement,\\
217 - because in this house
we do not keep secrets.\\
218 - What are you talking about?\\
219 - Cheesecake. Different
types of cheesecake.\\
220 - Oh. Sorry I missed it.\\
221 - Don't judge me.\\
222 - Kelso,
I need to use your bathroom.\\
223 - Nope. There's nobody here.\\
224 - Of course, I can't see people who
don't have parties for their friends.\\
225 - So maybe there is somebody
here, and I just can't see them.\\
226 - I can't see you, Eric!\\
227 - Kelso, I really need
to use the bathroom.\\
228 - Well, maybe you should have
thought of that\\
229 - before you kicked us out of
Donna's house, you party pooper.\\
230 - - Yeah.
- No party, no pooper!\\
231 - - Nice.
- Yeah, it really was. No party, no pooper!\\
232 - So then I said, "No party, no pooper!"
Because he wouldn't have a party.\\
233 - See, I think it's stupid that Eric and
Donna need to practice being married.\\
234 - I mean, it's simple.\\
235 - The woman just needs to be
a cook in the kitchen,\\
236 - a maid in the living room,
and an acrobat in the bedroom.\\
237 - And I can hire
a cook and a maid.\\
238 - I am liking you more and more.\\
239 - You know, I was thinking
about The Incredible Hulk.\\
240 - I like that show.\\
241 - Especially the part where he
gets all, like, mad and turns green\\
242 - and then his shirt rips off.\\
243 - But then I was thinking,
like, what if he was purple?\\
244 - And a lady?\\
245 - Come on. Like an
angry, naked purple chick.\\
246 - Yeah, that's better, right?\\
247 - What's going on down here?\\
248 - Why doesn't
anybody ever go home?\\
249 - And then I realized, that's
why they call it a clock radio.\\
250 - 'Cause it's got both!\\
251 - What are you doing here?
I thought Eric was with you.\\
252 - Eric is always with me\\
253 - in spirit.\\
254 - Don't pussyfoot around.\\
255 - I make three phone calls, you're
back on that raft you floated in on.\\
256 - - Eric is at Donna's.
- Fez!\\
257 - I fear the open sea.\\
258 - Kitty, you know what I
just found out about Eric?\\
259 - You found out?\\
260 - He lied to us. He's
spending the night at Donna's.\\
261 - Oh!\\
262 - What did you think it was?\\
263 - He has dirty
magazines in his closet.\\
264 - Our son is a pervert. I'm
just gonna go pray for him.\\
265 - Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!\\
266 - Well, speak of the idiot.\\
267 - I gotta use the bathroom.\\
268 - What's the matter with
the foreign kid's bathroom?\\
269 - That is where
you were, isn't it?\\
270 - Yeah, of course. Why would I lie
to you about something like that?\\
271 - I need bacon.\\
272 - Okay, the reason I'd lie
about something like that is...\\
273 - What happened? You piss
Donna off, and she locked you out?\\
274 - - Donna? No.
- Oh.\\
275 - Well, you pissed me off,
so I'm locking you out.\\
276 - - Did you find...
- Don't stop loving me!\\
277 - Well, look who's here.\\
278 - Oh, say, Eric,
the morning paper didn't come.\\
279 - So I thought that you could
tell me a story while I eat.\\
280 - I know how good you are
at making up stories.\\
281 - Why don't you tell me things?\\
282 - You can tell me things,
even bad things.\\
283 - A mother's love is like
a flower that never wilts.\\
284 - Unless it's lied to.\\
285 - If you're done reciting
poetry, I'd like to yell at the kid.\\
286 - Hey, Forman,
this is about to get ugly.\\
287 - So if you have to go potty,
now's a good time.\\
288 - I'm sorry.\\
289 - Okay, I shouldn't have
told you I was at Fez's.\\
290 - Do you ever think
about what you're doing with your life?\\
291 - Hey, Dad, it's my life, okay?
I'm grown-up now.\\
292 - Grown-up?\\
293 - Well, you sure say that a lot,
so it must be true. Let me try it.\\
294 - Hey,
everybody, I'm Mister Rogers.\\
295 - But wait,
I'm not wearing a sweater.\\
296 - And I'm about to kick your ass.\\
297 - Maybe it doesn't work.\\
298 - Maybe you're just an immature
pissant who still lies to his parents.\\
299 - You know what, Dad?\\
300 - Oh, my God. You're right.\\
301 - I have been lying, and acting
immature, and keeping secrets.\\
302 - And I swear to God, I'm
just as sick of it as you are.\\
303 - So, here's the truth.
Donna and I are engaged.\\
304 - I get his room.\\
305 - - You're engaged?
- Yeah.\\
306 - - I already gave her the ring.
- Kitty, are you hearing this?\\
307 - Yes, I am.\\
308 - And for the first time, too.\\
309 - Well, it's true.\\
310 - So, if I'm gonna be ready
to be married, which I am,\\
311 - then I guess I should be ready
to tell you the truth.\\
312 - So, there it is.\\
313 - Wow. That felt great.\\
314 - I'm gonna go see my fiancee.
Wow, that felt great, too.\\
315 - What a great day!\\
316 - Okay. Okay, this is good.\\
317 - We're all being open here.\\
318 - Does anybody have anything
else they wanna get off their chest?\\
319 - Mrs. Forman, I hate my jacket.\\
320 - Oh, well, now we're just
trying to hurt each other.\\
321 - Okay, now. Come on, Steven.\\
322 - Give it another chance.
Oh, it's snazzy!\\
323 - Hey, there. Hi, there.
Check out my outerwear.\\
324 - I'll just give this to Goodwill.\\
325 - And read the arm. "Stuntman."\\
326 - People are gonna
think I'm from Hollywood.\\
327 - Sorry.
\subsection {Episode 16: Whole Lotta Love}
1 - Forman, why'd you have
to tell Red you got engaged?\\
2 - Look at him yelling and waving.\\
3 - Oh! A little spit
just landed on Bob.\\
4 - Bob's so scared,
he's not even wiping it off.\\
5 - Oh, my God.\\
6 - Oh, my God. This time
Red is really gonna kill me.\\
7 - My only hope is that he actually
sticks his foot so far up my ass,\\
8 - he can't pull it out, and I get to
take him straight to hell with me.\\
9 - Yeah, why did you tell him?
We had it all planned.\\
10 - We were gonna give them wine,
get them all loose and juiced.\\
11 - But you spilled the beans.\\
12 - Good, because wine and beans
is not a good combo.\\
13 - Hey. Toot-toot,
if you know what I mean.\\
14 - Sorry I'm late!\\
15 - I was cutting through
backyards on the way over here,\\
16 - and the Hendersons
got a new jungle gym!\\
17 - Whoa, they're still yelling?\\
18 - Yeah. I'm trying to read Red's
lips, but I can't make it out.\\
19 - He keeps calling me
a "stupid duck."\\
20 - Ah!\\
21 - Hey, I'll go spy on them.\\
22 - I just gotta run home real quick
and change into my ninja outfit.\\
23 - I don't think this situation
calls for camouflage, Kelso.\\
24 - Well, that doesn't mean
it's not fun to wear, Eric!\\
25 - But they're just too
young to get married.\\
26 - How are they gonna
live on their own?\\
27 - Eric jumps a foot every
time the furnace kicks on.\\
28 - Exactly. He's not mature
enough to get married.\\
29 - I'm still cutting the crusts
off his sandwiches.\\
30 - Well, it's really more for me.
He's my baby.\\
31 - Don't mind me. Feel free to keep talking.
I'm just getting a soda. I'm not spying.\\
32 - Hey, I don't like
this engagement either,\\
33 - but it's not like
they can break it off.\\
34 - Why the hell not?\\
35 - Well, it wouldn't be
very romantic, for one.\\
36 - Oh, forget about it.
I'll take care of this myself!\\
37 - No, no. Red, if you go out there and
yell, you're just gonna drive him away.\\
38 - I'm sorry, Kitty, but yelling is the
only part of being a father that I enjoy.\\
39 - Red, Red, I am putting
my foot down. I forbid it.\\
40 - All right, fine.\\
41 - - Wow! Red, I forbid you to...
- Shut up, Bob.\\
42 - Burn!\\
43 - - Get out!
- Yeah.\\
44 - Well? What were they saying?\\
45 - I don't know.\\
46 - Well, I was so busy acting like I
wasn't listening, I forgot to listen.\\
47 - Man.\\
48 - I bet you he's trying
to think of a punishment.\\
49 - He already took away the
Vista Cruiser, and fined me.\\
50 - What's next?
Is he gonna cut off my pinkie?\\
51 - What's the point of getting
married, Red's gonna cut that off?\\
52 - Hanging out\\
53 - Down the street\\
54 - The same old thing\\
55 - We did last week\\
56 - Not a thing to do\\
57 - But talk to you\\
58 - We're all all right\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
61 - Nina, you have such
beautiful fingers,\\
62 - so long and elegant,
like spider legs.\\
63 - We can't do this here.\\
64 - We can go to the backseat
of the student-driver car.\\
65 - But I have to warn you, I have a hard
time keeping my hands at 10:00 and 2:00.\\
66 - Fez, this tension between us
is causing problems.\\
67 - And here at the DMV, I've
learned it's easier to solve problems\\
68 - when they're posed
in a multiple-choice format.\\
69 - So, "A", we can further
explore our relationship,\\
70 - and hope that
relieves the tension,\\
71 - or, "B", I can fire you.\\
72 - Is this some kind of trick?\\
73 - - It's not a trick.
- Hmm, so it is a trick.\\
74 - I choose "B."\\
75 - No, you choose "A"!\\
76 - Okay, I'll take "A."\\
77 - But I think you should
throw a little "T" in there, too.\\
78 - - Dinner's ready, Eric.
- You know what?\\
79 - Dad's in there, so I'll just,
you know, forage for berries.\\
80 - Look, I am not happy
about this situation either,\\
81 - but I am in there making the best of
it, not out here diddling a basketball.\\
82 - Mom, if I was out here
diddling a basketball,\\
83 - this would be a very
different conversation.\\
84 - Get in there.\\
85 - Well, look who I found.\\
86 - Our son,\\
87 - who we love very much.\\
88 - - Hey, Dad.
- Pass the peas, Steven.\\
89 - - Red, your son spoke to you.
- I heard him.\\
90 - But you asked me not to
yell at him, and I agreed,\\
91 - so I'm just taking
your idea and refining it.\\
92 - Oh, so you're giving me
the silent treatment?\\
93 - So,
Steven, how was school today?\\
94 - Well, in health class today,
we learned that\\
95 - an early engagement's
often a sign of heavy drug use.\\
96 - Hyde!\\
97 - Red, you're being a big baby.\\
98 - No, Mom, it's okay. Actually,
it's a pleasant surprise,\\
99 - but let's see how
serious he is about it.\\
100 - Hey, Dad, you know
who's got the right idea?\\
101 - Russia.\\
102 - I haven't felt this kind of tension
in years. Reminds me of home.\\
103 - Except,
everyone's wearing a shirt.\\
104 - Happy birthday!\\
105 - Oh! Is this for me?\\
106 - Yeah.\\
107 - - Jackie, it's your birthday?
- Oh, I figured you knew.\\
108 - A good boyfriend would have,
but whatever.\\
109 - Hey, why didn't you tell me, man?
I would have gotten you something.\\
110 - Well, I didn't wanna
make a big deal about it,\\
111 - 'cause I'm trying not to care so much
about gifts and material things, and...\\
112 - Oh, it's not working,
because this is beautiful!\\
113 - - Oh! I'm gonna go
try it on! Thank you!
- Mmm-hmm.\\
114 - Kelso, what are you doing, man?
You trying to make me look bad?\\
115 - No, I'm not doing anything.\\
116 - Well, whatever you are doing,\\
117 - you shouldn't go up against
me, 'cause you're not gonna win.\\
118 - Well, I'm not doing anything,
and I am going to win.\\
119 - No, you're gonna lose.\\
120 - Well, how can I lose
if I'm not doing anything?\\
121 - How can you win
if you're not doing anything?\\
122 - Well, if I win, I'll admit
that I'm doing something.\\
123 - Nina, I think people at work are starting
to notice there's something between us.\\
124 - Well, it didn't help when you
stood up at the staff meeting\\
125 - and said,
"I wanna do it with Nina."\\
126 - Well, they asked if there was
any unfinished business.\\
127 - I think I've figured out a way
to get rid of all this tension.\\
128 - - You need to spend
the night with me.
- I'm all yours, boss lady.\\
129 - But you have to tell me where to stop now,
because I have been burned in the past.\\
130 - I don't want you
to stop anywhere.\\
131 - Oh.\\
132 - Oh!\\
133 - I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!\\
134 - Fez!\\
135 - Sorry. I wrote this song about three
years ago, and I finally get to use it.\\
136 - You know, that sweater
wasn't on sale or anything.\\
137 - Paid full price.\\
138 - Pretty sweet, huh?\\
139 - Yes, but it gets less sweet
the more you talk about it.\\
140 - Sorry. I'm done.\\
141 - $27!\\
142 - Hey. How was work with Red?\\
143 - It was terrible. I thought Red
not talking to me would be cool,\\
144 - but today, instead of telling
me to sweep the back room,\\
145 - he just threw a broom at me.\\
146 - Well, what about
if I talked to him?\\
147 - I mean, we've always gotten along.
Maybe I can get through to him.\\
148 - Donna, I'm not gonna make you
fight my battles for me.\\
149 - I mean, I'm not gonna ask the
woman that I love to do what I should do.\\
150 - But Red will be home at around 5:30,
so try to catch him before dinner, okay?\\
151 - Attention, everyone.\\
152 - My friend Fez has
some wonderful news.\\
153 - Knock, knock.\\
154 - Who's there?\\
155 - I did it!\\
156 - All right, Fez!\\
157 - Now, now, wait, wait! I
wanna hear this. "I did it" who?\\
158 - Oh, wait, Fez, I can't believe
you finally lost your virginity!\\
159 - Wait, wait. This isn't like the
time you bought a hamster,\\
160 - named it "Virginity",
and then lost it, is it?\\
161 - No. This is the real thing.\\
162 - You know, I had a hamster once.\\
163 - I tied him up to a helium
balloon with a note.\\
164 - Made it all
the way to Minnesota.\\
165 - Alive?\\
166 - No, I'm gonna send a dead
hamster up in a balloon.\\
167 - - So? Come on. Tell us all about it.
- Yeah.\\
168 - Okay. Well, it was incredible.\\
169 - Nina and I started out kissing
in the living room,\\
170 - then we moved into the
bedroom, where we undressed.\\
171 - And, well, then...
Then we did it.\\
172 - What... Details,
Fez. We need details!\\
173 - Well, our faces
didn't line up right,\\
174 - so I kept bumping
my chin on her nose.\\
175 - And then there were some sounds.\\
176 - What kind of sounds?\\
177 - Well, I will say this,
it was not applause.\\
178 - There was no romantic music,
like in the movies, so I had to hum.\\
179 - And then Nina told
me to stop humming.\\
180 - And then I started again
without realizing it.\\
181 - And then she got mad.
And then I think she got sad.\\
182 - Oh, well, don't worry, Fez.\\
183 - She probably just felt bad she
was doing it with a foreigner.\\
184 - And then afterwards, I
went into the bathroom, and...\\
185 - And cried a little.\\
186 - And then I snuck
out the back door.\\
187 - Poor Fez.\\
188 - Well, you know, at least it
couldn't have been any worse.\\
189 - I left my
underwear in her bathroom.\\
190 - Mr. Forman, you
remember what it felt like\\
191 - when you fell in love with
Mrs. Forman, don't you?\\
192 - Nope. One day I just woke up,
and my life was over.\\
193 - Next question.\\
194 - Well, I think...\\
195 - I think what Mr.
Forman is trying to say\\
196 - is that we worry you're
too young to get married.\\
197 - Do you even know how to bake
a casserole? I don't think you do.\\
198 - Look, I believe there's one
person out there for everyone.\\
199 - And you guys are that person for each
other, and Eric is that person for me.\\
200 - And if you could
just open your hearts,\\
201 - you'd see that we should
be together forever,\\
202 - because we're in love, and we
make each other really happy.\\
203 - Donna, that is so romantic.\\
204 - I still think you're too young.\\
205 - But if it has to be someone,
I'm glad it's you.\\
206 - I always wanted a daughter.\\
207 - You already have a daughter.\\
208 - A better daughter.\\
209 - You know what, Donna? You're right.
You and Eric are perfect for each other.\\
210 - - Really?
- Yes!\\
211 - You're as big
a dumb ass as he is!\\
212 - Welcome to the family.\\
213 - I'm so nervous about
working with Nina today.\\
214 - It's like, now that we did it, I
never wanna see her face again.\\
215 - Yeah, you did it, all right.\\
216 - Hey, hey! Look who's
wearing a $27 sweater!\\
217 - Jackie,
you can't keep that sweater.\\
218 - - Why not?
- Because it's from Kelso.\\
219 - Yeah, but it's so pink and
fuzzy, that it just makes up for it.\\
220 - Kelso, she's someone else's
girlfriend. What are you doing?\\
221 - I'm not doing anything.\\
222 - And it's working.\\
223 - Just take it off.\\
224 - Leave it on.\\
225 - Take it off.
Let's see some skin.\\
226 - Yeah. Take it off.\\
227 - Why is everyone against me?\\
228 - Because you're telling a girl
to keep her top on.\\
229 - That's true. Take it off.\\
230 - - Hi.
- Hello.\\
231 - - Go ahead.
- After you.\\
232 - - Here, let me...
- No, I know how it goes.\\
233 - Okay, just...
I'm just trying to help.\\
234 - Now it's stuck!\\
235 - You just have to give it a yank.\\
236 - This is just like last night!\\
237 - Okay. Where's Red? I just found
out he called my daughter a dumb ass.\\
238 - What?\\
239 - Well, I really thought
I was getting through to him,\\
240 - but then he snuck
a "dumb ass" in.\\
241 - That is a hurtful word.\\
242 - You gotta do something
about your husband, Kitty.\\
243 - You guys would be
lucky to get Donna.\\
244 - If anything, she's gonna
pretty your family up.\\
245 - Excuse me?\\
246 - I'm just saying,
we're a voluptuous bunch.\\
247 - Mom, you need to talk to Dad.\\
248 - I don't know why you're
surprised he's upset.\\
249 - Why did you have to get engaged?\\
250 - And why did you have to tell
your father? He's not stable, Eric.\\
251 - Okay, fine.
I'll talk to him myself.\\
252 - Eric, be careful. I looked deep
into Red's eyes, and I saw...\\
253 - Well, I just saw me upside
down and tiny, but he looked mad.\\
254 - You know what? I don't care.
I'm going down to Price Mart.\\
255 - And if I don't come back, then,
Donna, please move on with your life.\\
256 - Wedding or no wedding, we're still
getting one of those triple-decker cakes.\\
257 - Oh, working with someone you have
had sex with, is the worst thing ever.\\
258 - I don't know how
Donny and Marie do it.\\
259 - You know, sex ruins everything.\\
260 - No, I disagree, Fez.\\
261 - I mean, sure,
the first time can be awkward.\\
262 - Well, I mean,
it wasn't for me and Jackie.\\
263 - You know, maybe I
should tell the story.\\
264 - Yeah.
It's a great story, Hyde.\\
265 - You know what, Kelso?
It's getting real old.\\
266 - And the story I remember after your first
time, was you didn't call her for a week.\\
267 - I was gonna skip that part.\\
268 - Wait, that's right.
You didn't call me.\\
269 - Oh, that's because he was
thinking about breaking up with you.\\
270 - What?\\
271 - No, I told you. I didn't call you 'cause
we were having our phones cleaned!\\
272 - And then to get back on your good side,
he bought you a stupid stuffed unicorn.\\
273 - Fluffycakes?\\
274 - Fluffycakes is tainted?\\
275 - See, he wanted something from
you, so he bought you a present.\\
276 - Sound familiar?\\
277 - Michael, why did you
buy me this sweater?\\
278 - All right.
It's time to come clean.\\
279 - I stole the sweater.\\
280 - Fine.
You know what? Forget it.\\
281 - I don't want it,
so just take it.\\
282 - Now we're talking.
Give us a little dance.\\
283 - Told you
it wouldn't work.\\
284 - I wasn't doing anything!\\
285 - Hey, let's not fight.\\
286 - We all saw a little Jackie
side-boob. I think we all won.\\
287 - - Hi, Fez. Okay, look...
- Nina,\\
288 - I know what you're going to say.\\
289 - The other night was awful,
and you just wanna be friends.\\
290 - No. I was going to say,
the other night was awful,\\
291 - and we should practice
and get better at it.\\
292 - Oh, well, I have to say, I
don't hate the sound of that.\\
293 - So, should I make
an appointment, or...\\
294 - - Just get in the house.
- Okay. One second.\\
295 - I'm going to do it again!
I'm going to do it again!\\
296 - Okay, Dad. You can ignore me,\\
297 - and you can call my girlfriend
names, but here's the thing.\\
298 - Donna and I are getting married,
okay? Whether you like it or not.\\
299 - But you're too young, and
you're throwing your life away.\\
300 - You said I was throwing my
life away when I quit T-ball.\\
301 - And I was right about that, too.\\
302 - You're not marrying her,
and that's final.\\
303 - Well,
Dad, you can't stop me, okay?\\
304 - I'm gonna be graduating soon,
I'll be on my own. I have a job.\\
305 - I mean, I make enough money
to pay for the wedding myself.\\
306 - Well, that's great. But you
don't have a job. You're fired.\\
307 - What?\\
308 - You're fired.\\
309 - Let's see you pay
for a wedding now.\\
310 - Punch out,
and empty your locker.\\
311 - Fine!\\
312 - - But I'm keeping the smock!
- Give me the smock!\\
313 - - Jackie.
- Mmm-hmm?\\
314 - Happy birthday.\\
315 - Steven, you shouldn't have!\\
316 - Oh!\\
317 - It's a Led Zeppelin T-shirt.\\
318 - And it's used!\\
319 - Yeah, that's my favorite one.\\
320 - You're with me now,
so I wanted you to have it.\\
321 - Aw, Steven, I love it!\\
322 - - Do I have to wear it?
- No.\\
323 - Steven, I love it! Oh!\\
324 - Well, that was a nice
20 minutes of silence.\\
325 - Who wants a little kick in
their coffee? I know I do.\\
326 - You're the dumb ass!
\subsection {Episode 17: The Battle of Evermore}
1 - Eric, what are you doing eating?\\
2 - Well, it's mainly for survival,\\
3 - but I also enjoy
the fruity tastes.\\
4 - I told you to replace the
hubcap on the Vista Cruiser.\\
5 - So, what is it?\\
6 - You're mature
enough to get married,\\
7 - but not mature enough
to replace a hubcap?\\
8 - Well, let's see. You took
away my keys, so I can't drive,\\
9 - and you took away my job,
so I can't afford a new hubcap,\\
10 - and you also took
away my self-esteem,\\
11 - so I have no pride in my job
or my possessions.\\
12 - For gosh sake, you've
been arguing for two weeks.\\
13 - Now stop it. Help me
with this crossword puzzle.\\
14 - I need a four-letter word
for disappointment.\\
15 - Eric.\\
16 - It fits.\\
17 - Well, now, that can't be right.\\
18 - So, he's like,
"Replace the hubcap."\\
19 - And I'm like, "Hey, why
don't you replace the hubcap."\\
20 - And that is why I'm
trimming the hedges.\\
21 - Yeah.\\
22 - I only mess with Red when
I really need the discipline.\\
23 - He's a total hard ass.\\
24 - Hard ass? Take another look, my
friend. It jiggles when he wiggles.\\
25 - Man, I don't know what
the hell the deal is with Leo.\\
26 - He told me to take a week off
from The Fotohut two weeks ago,\\
27 - - and I haven't
heard from him since.
- Well, we need to find him\\
28 - 'cause we're all out of film,
if you know what I mean.\\
29 - I need film, then I could take
pictures of Nina and me doing it.\\
30 - Fez, film doesn't
really mean film.\\
31 - Who cares?\\
32 - Because for the first time in my
life, doing it really means doing it.\\
33 - So, I guess this is the way\\
34 - an immature, engaged,
high school dumb ass,\\
35 - with no car, no job and no
money, trims the hedges.\\
36 - That was like eight
burns in one sentence.\\
37 - An octo-burn.\\
38 - Let's get the hell out of here.\\
39 - Okay, you two, since you
won't bond on your own,\\
40 - I have signed you up
for the father-son competition\\
41 - at this year's Point Place Paul
Bunyan Pioneer Day Jamboree.\\
42 - - Kitty, that sounds horrible.
- Yeah, I agree.\\
43 - You hear that?
We've already bonded.\\
44 - No, it's too late.
It's for charity.\\
45 - Now, don't forget\\
46 - your
commemorative coonskin caps.\\
47 - Huh!\\
48 - So that's what you'd
look like with hair.\\
49 - Hanging out\\
50 - Down the street\\
51 - The same old thing\\
52 - We did last week\\
53 - Not a thing to do\\
54 - But talk to you\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
58 - - Hey.
- I'd kiss you,\\
59 - but I'm afraid your hat will
wake up and scratch my eyes out.\\
60 - So, you guys, Joanne has been
chosen to emcee Pioneer Days.\\
61 - Tell them why, baby.\\
62 - I won the tobacco-spitting
contest last year.\\
63 - What a lady.\\
64 - I'll be manning
the hard-cider booth.\\
65 - It's a good way to raise
money, 'cause of all the drunks.\\
66 - Ooh, ooh! People are signing
in. Come on, get excited, you two!\\
67 - Well, howdy, newcomers!
I'm Charlie Miller.\\
68 - You can call me Charlie.
This is my son, Mitch.\\
69 - You can call me ladies' man.\\
70 - - Ladies' man.
- Did somebody call me?\\
71 - I'm Red Forman.
This is my son, Eric.\\
72 - You can call him dumb ass.\\
73 - Well,
we don't use the A-S-S word,\\
74 - we have a reputation to uphold.\\
75 - We're the two-time champs.\\
76 - Little secret, Red, I tell Mitch
here it doesn't matter how we do\\
77 - as long as we're together.\\
78 - - And why is that, Dad?
- 'Cause we bad!\\
79 - - Oh, yeah, that's right! We bad!
- We bad!\\
80 - All right. Dad, they have a
catch phrase. Hey, what's ours?\\
81 - Shut up, dumb ass.\\
82 - Yeah. Shut up,
dumb ass. Okay. Yeah.\\
83 - Oh, well, no wonder Leo
hasn't told me to come to work,\\
84 - there's no work to come to.\\
85 - - Mmm, did he leave a note?
- Nope,\\
86 - just this.\\
87 - You know, he looked dirty,\\
88 - but he always
smelled like clean sheets.\\
89 - You know, you're talking
about him like he's gone, man.\\
90 - He would have told me
if he was leaving town.\\
91 - Maybe a UFO appeared,\\
92 - and it shot down a beam,
and made everyone\\
93 - and everything
inside The Fotohut vanish.\\
94 - Yeah, like an apparition.\\
95 - Kelso, you don't even know
what an apparition is.\\
96 - Hey, if I can't use
words I don't understand,\\
97 - this is gonna be
one quiet afternoon.\\
98 - Let's get started.\\
99 - "To make room for
a new trading post,\\
100 - "Paul Bunyan needs to
clear-cut 200 acres of forest.\\
101 - "The first team to
chop 25 logs wins."\\
102 - And chop!\\
103 - Um, excuse me, my ax is stuck.\\
104 - Way to go, Mitch.\\
105 - - Ooh! That's right! We bad!
- Oh, yeah, we bad!\\
106 - - Pull the ax out, Eric.
- I can't,
it's really stuck in there.\\
107 - And you think you're ready to be
married. You can't even chop wood.\\
108 - What are you gonna do for heat
in the winter, burn comic books?\\
109 - Hmm, I don't know. I guess I would
probably just turn on the heater!\\
110 - How can Eric and Red
be fighting already?\\
111 - Well, it's almost as if forcing
them together against their will,\\
112 - and giving them sharp objects,\\
113 - wasn't really the best way
to get them to make up.\\
114 - Another hard cider, Bob.\\
115 - Make it a double.\\
116 - Well, we couldn't find Leo. We
just checked all his hangouts.\\
117 - - The Hub.
- Alley behind The Hub.\\
118 - - Fatso Burger.
- Alley behind
the Fatso Burger.\\
119 - Hyde, when are you gonna
accept the fact that Leo just bailed?\\
120 - Man, he would not leave
without saying goodbye, okay?\\
121 - I know him better
than I know my own father.\\
122 - I'd like to do it
with Nina in an alley.\\
123 - My bare ass\\
124 - pressed up
against a cold dumpster.\\
125 - You know, we're getting killed here
thanks to your screwing up that last event.\\
126 - All you had to do was build
a cabin out of Lincoln Logs.\\
127 - Well, I thought I'd score some extra
points by building the Millennium Falcon.\\
128 - The Millennium what?\\
129 - If that's a Star Wars thing,
I'm gonna kick you in the ass.\\
130 - It's not a Star Wars thing,\\
131 - it's a very rare falcon\\
132 - that can do the Kessel Run
in under six parsecs.\\
133 - Hey, just remember, guys,
it's not whether you win or lose,\\
134 - it's how you play the game.\\
135 - Unfortunately, you guys don't
know how to play the game.\\
136 - Oh, ho, no, hey, hey. We don't wanna
rub in their face that they're big losers.\\
137 - - Ooh!
- Ooh!\\
138 - - Uh-oh.
- I didn't... It came out!\\
139 - This is the worst Point Place Paul
Bunyan Pioneer Days Jamboree ever.\\
140 - And now, the cow-milking event.\\
141 - Could you just award us our
first-place points right now?\\
142 - It'd save a lot of time and
embarrassment for our friends over here.\\
143 - You know, it kind of would.\\
144 - "Babe the Blue Ox needs lots of
calcium to carry Paul Bunyan's lumber,\\
145 - "or his brittle bones
will snap, and he'll die.\\
146 - "The first team to fill
their barrel with milk\\
147 - "and save Babe from
osteoporosis, wins."\\
148 - And milk!\\
149 - Hey! There's something wrong
with our cow.\\
150 - Her things aren't working!\\
151 - Well,
you can't just yank on them.\\
152 - Red never was much for foreplay.\\
153 - - Keep it coming, Mitch.
- This is amazing.\\
154 - It's like she was just waiting
for my magic fingers\\
155 - to coax that sweet liquid
right out of her teats.\\
156 - Move over, Dad.
I'll show you how it's done.\\
157 - What makes you think that you...\\
158 - Go, Eric. Go.\\
159 - Well, honey, good for you.\\
160 - Mitch, they're winning. What
happened to your magic fingers?\\
161 - Get off my back, old man!\\
162 - Dad, here.\\
163 - Team Forman wins!\\
164 - You let me down, Son. I
thought you were better than that.\\
165 - Oh, what are you gonna do?
Lock me in the closet again?\\
166 - He locks me in the closet!\\
167 - It's a walk-in!
It's a walk-in.\\
168 - So, Dad, what do you say now?\\
169 - Why are you so good at that?\\
170 - How are we gonna break
into Leo's apartment?\\
171 - You need a credit
card to slip in the door.\\
172 - Ponch used one on CHiPs once,\\
173 - and the lady he rescued
was so grateful, they did it.\\
174 - Kelso, if we had a credit card,\\
175 - we could buy a sledgehammer
and break down the door.\\
176 - If we had a credit card, I'd be
butt-deep in Jordache right now.\\
177 - - Oh, Leo, man.
- I'm gonna kick him,
see if he's okay.\\
178 - - Kelso, no.
- Well, at least
throw something at him.\\
179 - If he's asleep, he'll wake up,\\
180 - and if he's dead, you can say
you threw something at a dead guy.\\
181 - Officer, I
have a prescription for that.\\
182 - No, relax, bud.
We're just looking for Leo.\\
183 - Oh, he left.
I'm his cousin, Eli.\\
184 - Really, he just left?
He didn't call or anything?\\
185 - Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.\\
186 - Yeah, don't take it personal, Hyde.
You know Leo never liked phones.\\
187 - He said he could
hear voices in them.\\
188 - By the way, he left a note.\\
189 - Do any of you know
a kid named Heidi?\\
190 - He means Hyde. That's me, man.
The note's for me!\\
191 - I mean,
the note's for me.\\
192 - "Dear Hyde, man. One day I
stopped in Point Place for some gas.\\
193 - "Before I knew it,
eight years had passed.\\
194 - "Whoa, that rhymes.\\
195 - "Anyway,
I should get home to my wife.\\
196 - "Take care.
You're a good kid, man.\\
197 - "You're a good kid, man."\\
198 - See, I told you he wouldn't
leave without saying goodbye.\\
199 - Oh, Steven, you really do love
that old, dirty little hippie.\\
200 - And he left you something else.\\
201 - He said that you liked film,
if you know what I mean.\\
202 - All right.\\
203 - I was hoping we could take
a little something home,\\
204 - you know,
put it in the shirt pocket.\\
205 - Holy hell!\\
206 - You know,
Donna, I've been drinking...\\
207 - I mean, thinking.\\
208 - I want you and
Eric to get married.\\
209 - Okay, even though I know
it's just the cider talking, yay!\\
210 - "Pioneer Pete is
lost in the woods.\\
211 - "Assemble the map
to find his bow and arrow,\\
212 - "and shoot the bell with the
arrow, and Pioneer Pete will appear.\\
213 - "Do not shoot Pioneer Pete."\\
214 - And go.\\
215 - - Okay, this one goes here.
- And this piece goes here.\\
216 - Come on, Mitch. Don't give up.\\
217 - Oh, okay, Mr. I Haven't
Had A Job In Five Years.\\
218 - So, the bow and arrow are
behind the feeding trough!\\
219 - Go, go, go!\\
220 - - Yeah!
- Yes!\\
221 - Howdy, y'all!
I'm Pioneer Pete!\\
222 - Look, Donna, it's me, your dad.\\
223 - Well,
Mitch, I hope you're happy.\\
224 - How can I be happy?
Our whole life is a lie.\\
225 - I mean, am I really supposed to
believe that Kathy is my little sister?\\
226 - She doesn't look anything like
me. She is Cuban, for Pete's sake!\\
227 - And what about
your Friday bowling nights?\\
228 - I looked in your bowling bag,
you know what I found?\\
229 - Buttless chaps!\\
230 - What's with the buttless chaps?\\
231 - Your mother's inhibited.\\
232 - Don't shake hands with that guy.\\
233 - I can't close my mouth.\\
234 - Can you close your mouth?\\
235 - It's really
starting to freak me out.\\
236 - Leo's the best.\\
237 - Leo made me
a grilled cheese once.\\
238 - He used butter, and he
made the crust extra toasty.\\
239 - He forgot cheese.\\
240 - I'm gonna miss that
grilled-cheese-making son of a bitch.\\
241 - You know, one time, I heard
Leo talking on the phone,\\
242 - and he was speaking Chinese.\\
243 - So, I said,
"Leo, stop speaking Chinese."\\
244 - So, he turned around,
and it wasn't Leo.\\
245 - It was a Chinese guy.\\
246 - You know,
I'll never forget that.\\
247 - I'm just sad I'll never get to see his
face when I tell him I did it with Nina.\\
248 - Actually, I'd like to see my
face when I do it with Nina.\\
249 - I bet I look like a stallion.\\
250 - So, today we sit in this
circle in honor of Leo.\\
251 - He was my boss.
He was my friend.\\
252 - He was my connection. To Leo!\\
253 - To Leo!\\
254 - Well,\\
255 - I found out how much cider
is too much cider.\\
256 - A barrel?\\
257 - Shut it!\\
258 - Great news. Little Timmy Stinson
cut his finger off in a whittling event.\\
259 - They're out,
we're in second place.\\
260 - And if we win this next event,
we'll be champions,\\
261 - and maybe even friends.\\
262 - Look, we've had a rough day,\\
263 - and we've both said some
things that we didn't mean,\\
264 - but we've got to pull it
together for this final event.\\
265 - Just tell me where
you go Friday nights.\\
266 - I rent a motel room, and I
lock the door, and I cry, okay?\\
267 - I cry like a damn baby.\\
268 - Why do you need
buttless chaps for that?\\
269 - Okay, it's time
for our final event.\\
270 - "Transport your gold in a genuine
covered wagon to Pioneer Pete's"...\\
271 - You know what? I'm tired.
Pull the wagons. Go.\\
272 - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\\
273 - Who's bad?\\
274 - - We bad.
- That's right.\\
275 - - We bad!
- We bad! We bad!\\
276 - Okay, it's time
for Pioneer Pete to claim his gold!\\
277 - I saw that, Donna.\\
278 - Well, I'm sorry. I know you think
I'm a disappointment and stuff.\\
279 - Hey. I'm proud of how we did.\\
280 - Look, I know what it's like to have
your dad riding you all the time.\\
281 - My old man was always on me
to go to engineering school,\\
282 - and when I didn't, he was so
mad, we didn't talk for a year.\\
283 - So, you're
the softy in your family?\\
284 - See, my dad's vision
for my life was wrong.\\
285 - Only I knew what was best,\\
286 - not my dad. You
understand what I'm saying?\\
287 - Wow. Are you admitting
that you're wrong,\\
288 - that it's okay for me and
Donna to get married?\\
289 - What?\\
290 - No, no.\\
291 - I'm saying that my dad
was wrong, and I was right,\\
292 - just like I'm right now.\\
293 - The point is, I'm always
right, so break it off!\\
294 - Well, at least
you're still happy for us.\\
295 - Please, Donna, I'm standing
right here. There's no need to yell!\\
296 - You know what?
I don't care what my dad says,\\
297 - I am more committed to
this marriage than ever.\\
298 - Well, after seeing how you
handled that cow, so am I.\\
299 - Okay, so you raise the ax,
and you bring it straight down.\\
300 - - Okay? Raise. Bring down.
- That's easy.\\
301 - Yeah. It's all about leverage.
You know, torque.\\
302 - Okay. I don't know what either
of those is, but I'll give it a shot.\\
303 - - Let's get out of here.
- Right behind you.
\subsection {Episode 18: Hey, Hey What Can I Do}
1 - So, Hyde, big job fair tomorrow.\\
2 - Oh, and you're in luck, 'cause
I read that corporate America\\
3 - is experiencing a severe shortage
of paranoid conspiracy nuts.\\
4 - I'm not a conspiracy nut, okay?\\
5 - My history,
shop and gym teachers\\
6 - secretly started that rumor
to discredit me.\\
7 - I do need a job though,
since The Fotohut shut down.\\
8 - And I'm never gonna get my
pictures back, which is a real shame,\\
9 - 'cause they'll never let me
under the bleachers anymore.\\
10 - You need a job, too, Eric,\\
11 - since you just got fired from
your last job by your own daddy.\\
12 - Well, at least my daddy's
not in jail for bribery.\\
13 - Okay. So get this,\\
14 - the radio station I work at\\
15 - wants me to work their
job-fair booth as "Hot Donna."\\
16 - All right? As if I'm some
object for guys to leer at. God.\\
17 - - Whoa!
- Oh, my God!\\
18 - Spank me!\\
19 - I guess being
beautiful has its benefits.\\
20 - Hey, shut up. I'm embarrassed.\\
21 - I'm talking about me, Donna.\\
22 - And the best thing about being
beautiful is I can get work as a model.\\
23 - So I don't have to go to the
job fair like the rest of you uggos.\\
24 - Well, I cannot wait.\\
25 - Nina will be at the DMV booth,
which means that Fez\\
26 - will be making out
during a school day.\\
27 - How many of you suckers have
made out during a school day?\\
28 - How many of you suckers have made
out during a school day in the nude?\\
29 - Then I will be nude.\\
30 - - Oh, my God!
- What? What?\\
31 - I got startled, 'cause I caught a
glimpse of myself in the mirror.\\
32 - I'm so handsome, I thought Shaun
Cassidy was sitting in the backseat.\\
33 - Yes. You are
a beautiful male specimen.\\
34 - Except you have a gray hair.\\
35 - What?\\
36 - No, I don't.\\
37 - Dude, I hit a cop car.\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - All right, Eric, listen up.\\
48 - You know how your mother and I feel
about you and Donna getting engaged,\\
49 - but since you won't listen to
reason, I've come to a decision.\\
50 - If you don't
cancel this engagement,\\
51 - I'm not paying for your college.\\
52 - What?\\
53 - Because he loves you.\\
54 - No, he doesn't.\\
55 - Yes, he does.
He's full of love,\\
56 - but it's buried,
just like treasure.\\
57 - - Dad, how could you do this?
- Oh, it's easy.\\
58 - Instead of giving
$4,000 to a college,\\
59 - I leave my cheque book in
the drawer, count my money,\\
60 - and laugh like a little girl.\\
61 - Fine.\\
62 - He laughs
because he loves you!\\
63 - Where did you learn
your parenting skills?\\
64 - Korea.\\
65 - Kitty, I am right about this.\\
66 - Red, you can't just force
people to do what you want.\\
67 - Oh, see, that's one of those things
that people say that's just not true.\\
68 - Like,
"There's no place like home."\\
69 - Hell, I can think of a hundred
places better than this.\\
70 - I cannot believe
you hit a police car.\\
71 - No, no, don't worry.
It's a hot lady cop.\\
72 - Just watch the master.\\
73 - - License and registration.
- Yeah. Just give me a sec here.\\
74 - My wallet gets
stuck, 'cause I've been working out.\\
75 - My leg muscles are huge.\\
76 - Oh, boy. By the way,
I can bench about 220,\\
77 - so that'd be about
two of you, little lady.\\
78 - What's your name?\\
79 - Oh, my name is Fez, but I have a girlfriend,
so you need to cool it, little girl.\\
80 - Yeah. I'll try.\\
81 - Okay, Mr. Kelso.\\
82 - I'm gonna issue you a citation.\\
83 - Oh, boy, a citation for being
too foxy in a school zone?\\
84 - No. A citation for $64.\\
85 - Bench press that.\\
86 - So, if we don't break off the engagement,
Red's not gonna pay for my college.\\
87 - You know, maybe this is
it, Eric. Maybe Red won.\\
88 - No. No, okay?\\
89 - He's not gonna win.\\
90 - You know what?\\
91 - I'll just look for something
full-time at the job fair.\\
92 - I'll pay for college myself.
People do that, right?\\
93 - Yeah, people with skills.\\
94 - - But, I mean, you're cute. That's a skill.
- Stop.\\
95 - How can Red do this to me?\\
96 - I swear to God,
that man is always mad.\\
97 - I think the gene for joy
might be stored in hair.\\
98 - Well, there are
a lot of angry bald men.\\
99 - Yul Brynner in The King and I.\\
100 - Yes, Mr. Freeze from Batman.\\
101 - Remember that time Robin
foiled his deep freeze...\\
102 - Eric.\\
103 - What did we talk about?\\
104 - Every time I reference
Batman, I owe you a geek dollar.\\
105 - Yes, thank you.\\
106 - Guys,
something horrible happened.\\
107 - Let me tell it.\\
108 - Kelso tried to charm a
lady cop, and it didn't work.\\
109 - But she was all over me, boy.\\
110 - I'm like freaking catnip.\\
111 - Guys, today made me
realize looks fade!\\
112 - I'm not gonna be able
to be a model forever!\\
113 - I'm gonna have to get
a practical, realistic job,\\
114 - like regular, ugly people.\\
115 - Okay, so which sounds better,
wide receiver or spy?\\
116 - Well, Kelso, I don't see
why you couldn't just do both.\\
117 - You're right.
It's the perfect cover.\\
118 - Okay. Okay, everybody!\\
119 - This is your last
school field trip, so smile!\\
120 - Okay, now wave hello to
your futures. "Hello, futures!"\\
121 - Okay, now, wave goodbye
to your mothers who loved you\\
122 - and gave you the best
years of their lives.\\
123 - Now what are they gonna do? What?
Tell me what I am supposed to do!\\
124 - You're supposed to take
your little yellow pill.\\
125 - That's what
you're supposed to do.\\
126 - Man, look at this place.
There's tons of butt-ugly people.\\
127 - And one day I'm
gonna be one of them.\\
128 - Man, I can't do this.\\
129 - Being around this
many corporate stooges.\\
130 - I can't breathe!\\
131 - Steven, stop it!
This is serious.\\
132 - If you keep pulling at cotton
like that, it won't rebound.\\
133 - Well, I'm off to find Nina
for a little field-trip make out.\\
134 - How many of you suckers
have made out during a field trip?\\
135 - What the hell? Was I the only
one watching sausage get made?\\
136 - Well, lookee here.\\
137 - You know, if America's employers
are looking for a pretty-boy moron,\\
138 - an engaged hophead,
and a mush-mouthed foreigner,\\
139 - they're gonna be
jumping for joy.\\
140 - Wait a minute.
Am I the pretty-boy moron?\\
141 - - Yes.
- Cool,
'cause that's the best one.\\
142 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
143 - - So, you ready for
the big job search?
- Yup.\\
144 - I got my resume,
my very best blazer,\\
145 - and a really charming story
about how my biggest fault\\
146 - is that I just work
too darn hard, so...\\
147 - How about you?\\
148 - I don't know.
This is so humiliating.\\
149 - I mean, I have a brain, you know.
2,000 records sorted by artist and genre.\\
150 - I didn't do that with my boobs.\\
151 - That'd be a neat trick though.\\
152 - I've always been fascinated
by the veterinary sciences.\\
153 - Do you have any jobs available?\\
154 - Yes. We need someone to usher
our four-legged friends into the next life.\\
155 - All right. That sounds
fantastic. And how do I do that?\\
156 - You shovel
the carcass into the furnace.\\
157 - I've always been fascinated
by transportation.\\
158 - - Do you have any
jobs available?
- Yes, road-kill remover.\\
159 - Except, sometimes
the critter's not quite dead.\\
160 - In that case, you gotta shoot
it. You're the "triggerman."\\
161 - I've always been fascinated by\\
162 - meat.\\
163 - - Do you have any
jobs available?
- Yes. Triggerman.\\
164 - Please tell me you're kidding.\\
165 - The cows don't
kill themselves, son.\\
166 - Although, I did see one
walk right off a cliff once.\\
167 - Stock boy. Need a stock boy.\\
168 - Not you.\\
169 - So, if I work here, will I
have to slaughter anything?\\
170 - No, we're a bank.\\
171 - We're looking for tellers.\\
172 - And just to be perfectly clear, I
won't have to murder any animals?\\
173 - Whatever you do on your
own time is fine with us.\\
174 - Hello, First Midwestern!\\
175 - Hi, I'm Jackie,
and this is Steven.\\
176 - Steven is a no-nonsense Sagittarius
who's not afraid of hard work or true love.\\
177 - I'm Dave, a shy Pisces
who's looking for love,\\
178 - and a salesman to
sell on commission.\\
179 - - The more you sell,
the more you can earn.
- That's perfect for him!\\
180 - Steven, if you can get me to
date you, you can sell anything.\\
181 - Thanks, but, no thanks.\\
182 - Wait...\\
183 - Are you nuts? That guy
almost offered me a job!\\
184 - - So, what's wrong?
- Did you hear him?\\
185 - "The more you sell,
the more you earn?"\\
186 - The more you sleep, the
more you earn. That's my job.\\
187 - Damn, woman!\\
188 - So, Nina, after
walking around the job fair,\\
189 - and hearing
the word "job" a lot,\\
190 - it gave me needs.\\
191 - - No. We're at a job fair.
- Please don't say that word.\\
192 - Well, I can't go far from
my booth, it's my job.\\
193 - Stop it!\\
194 - Hi.\\
195 - One of your officers
recently issued me a ticket.\\
196 - - My name is Michael Kelso.
- Michael Kelso.\\
197 - Wait a minute. Officer Debbie?\\
198 - Oh, my God!
What happened to you?\\
199 - You're like
your own ugly sister!\\
200 - - What do you want, Mr. Kelso?
- What do I want?\\
201 - I wanna know how one minute you're
all wah-wah, and the next you're all...\\
202 - - Good cripes!
- Hey, now...\\
203 - Well, I'm just saying, in your uniform
you are like a totally hot police chick,\\
204 - but out of your uniform,
you're a total pie face.\\
205 - Well, good God!\\
206 - Wait a minute.\\
207 - It's like you got all your
charisma from your uniform.\\
208 - What is happening to you? What?
Are you having a stroke? What?\\
209 - No, that's just how I look
when I have an idea.\\
210 - To Eddie.\\
211 - Love, Hot Donna.\\
212 - Hot Donna has
now signed 87 guys!\\
213 - And two girls.\\
214 - It's like,
who knew, in our little town?\\
215 - Well, I can see you got over
your little bout of shyness.\\
216 - What the hell? They think
I'm hot. And you know what?\\
217 - Hot Donna rules!\\
218 - So, great news. I got a job
at First Midwestern Bank.\\
219 - Oh, my God! Eric.\\
220 - I know. And they have branches
all over Wisconsin,\\
221 - so wherever you go to school,
I'll have a job.\\
222 - I'll save some money. I can
start school, like, a year after you.\\
223 - And I don't even have
to slaughter animals.\\
224 - Was that ever an option?\\
225 - Apparently it's the invisible
industry of Point Place, yeah.\\
226 - I'm actually surprised the streets
aren't running red with blood.\\
227 - Well, Steven, it is obvious
you don't want a job.\\
228 - No. I'm just holding out for
one that has a cash register\\
229 - with a lock that's very,
very easy to jimmy.\\
230 - - Oh, God! Excuse me.
- Oh, that's okay. I probably deserved it.\\
231 - Roy.\\
232 - Steven?\\
233 - Hey, man. Long time no see.\\
234 - When my dad left, my mom signed
me up for the Big Brother program,\\
235 - and I got Roy. And we had some
good times before you left town.\\
236 - - Yeah, I moved in
with a wonderful woman.
- Oh. What happened?\\
237 - She found out I
was living there.\\
238 - Roy has some
problems with people.\\
239 - They don't like me. Yeah.
You don't like me, right?\\
240 - Not really.\\
241 - But to be fair,
I have very high standards.\\
242 - Yeah?
She's really nice, Steven.\\
243 - Hey, so what are you doing here?\\
244 - I work here.
Hotel kitchen manager.\\
245 - I was gonna put out word
that we are looking for a cook,\\
246 - but then I figured, why bother?\\
247 - They'll just leave me
like everybody else.\\
248 - So, Roy, you seem
a little depressed there.\\
249 - - Yeah,
I'm teetering on the brink.
- Hmm.\\
250 - - Maybe I can do
something to cheer you up.
- Really?\\
251 - Oh, that'd be great.\\
252 - So, I'm on the Golden Gate Bridge,
and everyone's telling me to jump.\\
253 - I was just out for a jog.\\
254 - Okay, Roy, here's what
I'm gonna do for you.\\
255 - I'm gonna take that job as
cook, and keep you company,\\
256 - on two conditions.\\
257 - I'm not gonna work very hard, and
you're gonna have to pay me a lot.\\
258 - But, man, it'll be a bargain,\\
259 - considering the money you save
on hookers and shrinks.\\
260 - Great. And if it's work-related,
I can call you at home.\\
261 - Now I have
a reason to get a phone.\\
262 - Steven, you're a chef!\\
263 - If you can learn to make
those fancy deviled-egg thingies,\\
264 - I will lose my freaking mind!\\
265 - So, how's the day going?\\
266 - Well, let's see. I interviewed
15 potential employees:\\
267 - 10 dumb asses,\\
268 - four cretins and a mama's boy.\\
269 - I vote for the mama's boy.
I think they're sweet.\\
270 - Hey, Dad! Guess what.\\
271 - I got a job at First Midwestern,
so Donna and I can stay engaged.\\
272 - I'll work, she'll study, and in a few years,
I can pay for my own tuition. Yay! I win!\\
273 - Great news!\\
274 - I'm gonna be a cop!\\
275 - No. No,
listen. It's perfect for me.\\
276 - The uniform will keep me
looking hot, even when I'm old.\\
277 - And plus, I love helping people.\\
278 - No, you love humping people.\\
279 - Eric, a lot of times
humping is helping.\\
280 - So,
you're really gonna be a cop?\\
281 - Well, he did shoot me, so
we know he's good with guns.\\
282 - And you just know they're
gonna partner him up with a dog.\\
283 - Actually, you know what?
It's kind of perfect.\\
284 - He'll get to run through
people's backyards with a stick.\\
285 - He does that anyway.\\
286 - The important thing is,
is that I'll be performing\\
287 - a very valuable
community service.\\
288 - And plus, I'll be sexy forever.\\
289 - I mean, just think about it.\\
290 - Nobody move!
This is a robbery.\\
291 - Not in my town, dirt bag.\\
292 - Oh, Officer, not only did you
perform a valuable community service,\\
293 - you'll be sexy forever!\\
294 - All in a day's work, ma'am.\\
295 - Now, let's get you into
something a little more comfortable.\\
296 - - But I'm already in a bikini.
- I know.\\
297 - Kelso, you do realize you'll
have to help ugly people, too.\\
298 - Nah. I'll just leave
that for the fat cops.\\
299 - Hey. I just got off
the phone with the bank.\\
300 - And I didn't get the job, because
someone gave me a bad reference.\\
301 - And then I thought to myself,
"Hmm. I've only had one boss." You!\\
302 - I can't believe you
blackballed your own son!\\
303 - As usual, I don't know what
the hell you're talking about.\\
304 - Oh, so you're not even man enough
to admit it? You know what I think?\\
305 - I think you're a bitter, old man
who's so miserable in his life,\\
306 - that you have to make everyone
else just as miserable as you are!\\
307 - - You're pathetic!
- Honey.\\
308 - Your father didn't call
the bank manager, I did.\\
309 - Mom, please stay out of this.\\
310 - What was that?\\
311 - - I gave you the bad reference.
- Oh.\\
312 - Then...\\
313 - I'm just kidding.\\
314 - Eric, if you take a bank job
and put off school,\\
315 - you'll never go to college, and
the bank manager agreed with me.\\
316 - Plus, I told him
you were bad at math.\\
317 - So, there's no job
money to pay for college,\\
318 - no money from you
guys to go to college.\\
319 - Wow. I guess we're really hoping
for that football scholarship, huh?\\
320 - I have a compromise.\\
321 - Your father and I
will pay for college\\
322 - if you and Donna will agree to just
put off your engagement for one year.\\
323 - I'm not compromising anything!\\
324 - He said some hurtful things.\\
325 - No. I'm sick of being
controlled by both of you guys.\\
326 - You guys can keep your
money, okay? 'Cause guess what,\\
327 - I don't want it!\\
328 - Ma'am! Sir!\\
329 - We got a call
about a domestic disturbance.\\
330 - Get out of here.\\
331 - Okay, but if I gotta come back out
here, somebody's going downtown.\\
332 - Well, quit it.
I'm just practicing.\\
333 - And this is the pantry.\\
334 - If you ever get really depressed,
it's a good place to go and cry.\\
335 - Also, it's where
we keep the mustard.\\
336 - All right, cool. Well, I
guess I'll see you on Monday.\\
337 - Okay!\\
338 - Okay, man. Okay, Roy.\\
339 - Get off me!\\
340 - Oh, I almost forgot to
show you the walk-in freezer.\\
341 - A little privacy, please!
\subsection {Episode 19: Bring It on Home}
1 - It's the A-bomb!
Duck and cover!\\
2 - I bet Eric's
trying to sneak out.\\
3 - Red, Red, wait, wait.
What if it's a burglar?\\
4 - What's a burglar
gonna steal from us?\\
5 - My Shirley Temple figurines.\\
6 - Oh, I knew I shouldn't have
told Liz Anderson about them.\\
7 - Her nephew's been
in jail, you know.\\
8 - Oh!
Look at this. Some guard dog.\\
9 - You know, we could be trampled
by Mongolians,\\
10 - this thing wouldn't
even wag its tail.\\
11 - Hey.
I heard a scary noise.\\
12 - Good God. Are you nude?\\
13 - No.\\
14 - I'm wearing my toga.\\
15 - - There it is again.
- That's it,
I'm getting my bat.\\
16 - All right, calm down. It's probably
just Steven trying to sneak out.\\
17 - What if it's not Steven?
What if the burglar has Steven?\\
18 - Well, then we'll try to talk
him into taking Eric, too.\\
19 - - Okay, let's do this.
- Look at him.\\
20 - Bare-assed and
holding a plastic bat.\\
21 - That's your son, Kitty.\\
22 - What kind of burglar
robs people on a weeknight?\\
23 - Doesn't he have a job to go to
in the morning?\\
24 - - Jackie?
- What the hell?\\
25 - - Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!\\
26 - Forman, are you naked?\\
27 - Hanging out\\
28 - Down the street\\
29 - The same old thing\\
30 - We did last week\\
31 - Not a thing to do\\
32 - But talk to you\\
33 - We're all all right\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
36 - Who the hell do
you think you are,\\
37 - bringing a girl into my house
in the middle of the night?\\
38 - And right in our basement. We keep
our Christmas decorations down there.\\
39 - Baby Jesus was watching.\\
40 - I told you to look
where you were going.\\
41 - But what idiot leaves a Lego
set right in front of the door?\\
42 - You knocked over
my space command center?\\
43 - I spent three
hours building that.\\
44 - All right. Now what is
going on in my basement?\\
45 - Jackie's been sleeping here
the last couple of weeks.\\
46 - Couple of weeks? This is not
the Playboy Mansion, you know.\\
47 - - Look, nothing was going on.
- Nothing was going on?\\
48 - Space command
centers were ruined!\\
49 - Would you please go
put some pants on?\\
50 - This is where I eat.\\
51 - Jackie's only been staying here\\
52 - 'cause her dad's in jail and
her mom's still not back yet.\\
53 - Steven! That's private.\\
54 - Your mom's not back yet?
You told me she came home.\\
55 - Look, can we not talk about this?
I'm fine. Okay? Everything is fine.\\
56 - - But if you need a place...
- No, no, no. I don't need anything.\\
57 - Look, I'm only here 'cause...\\
58 - I am such a tramp.\\
59 - So, I should just go home
and try to control my dirty urges.\\
60 - Jackie, you're not going home.
There's nobody there.\\
61 - All right, look, Jackie, tonight
you can sleep in Laurie's room,\\
62 - and then tomorrow, we'll
track down your floozy mother.\\
63 - Honey, do you have any idea
where she might be?\\
64 - Well, the last postcard I got had a picture
of some guy with a bone through his nose.\\
65 - What is that, like, Tennessee?\\
66 - Hey, Donna, this just in.\\
67 - Your weirdo
boyfriend sleeps in the nude.\\
68 - Yeah, so? I do, too.\\
69 - Oh, yeah!\\
70 - Oh, I can see it now,\\
71 - and it is glorious.\\
72 - Excuse me.\\
73 - Jackie, I can't believe
your parents are gone.\\
74 - I'm so sorry.\\
75 - Okay, everybody needs to
stop worrying about me. I'm fine.\\
76 - I mean, how could I not be?\\
77 - Mrs. Forman did my hair and
made me smiley-faced pancakes.\\
78 - Eric, this house is like a shabby
hotel with really great service.\\
79 - Oh, hey, while you're visiting,\\
80 - here's my Lego set and a picture
of the space command center.\\
81 - Okay? Get building.\\
82 - And I swear to God,\\
83 - if my three-man escape pod doesn't
fit the star bay, heads are gonna roll.\\
84 - I have a question.\\
85 - If Hyde was in Hyde's bed,
and Jackie was in Hyde's bed,\\
86 - what exactly was
going on in said bed?\\
87 - - Nothing. She needed a place to sleep.
- "Needed a place to sleep?"\\
88 - Well, a bed is an interesting
choice, now, wouldn't you say?\\
89 - Oh, shut up, Michael. It's
not like we were doing it.\\
90 - Oh, come on, Jackie.\\
91 - You can't sleep in the same bed
with someone and not be doing it.\\
92 - I've fallen asleep not doing
it and woken up doing it.\\
93 - And that's why they won't
put him to sleep at the dentist.\\
94 - Guys, I don't know
what's going on with Nina.\\
95 - I keep asking to meet her parents,
but she keeps making excuses.\\
96 - It's probably the same reason I
won't let you meet my parents.\\
97 - I mean, she's afraid you're gonna
say something weird and embarrass her.\\
98 - Oh, please. I'm a hot-looking,
smooth-talking, frisky-assed son of a bitch.\\
99 - Hey, Fez.
Right there. That's like...\\
100 - That's like a really
weird thing to say.\\
101 - Yeah, I mean, we're used to
you, but, dude, you're weird.\\
102 - I mean, and for Nina to
let you meet her parents, I...\\
103 - I think what Kelso's
trying to say, is that\\
104 - maybe you don't make
the best first impression.\\
105 - Like, remember the first time
you met my parents?\\
106 - - Mom, Dad, this is Fez.
- Well, hello there.\\
107 - He did what?\\
108 - Yeah, and then it actually got
even more disturbing.\\
109 - Get this creepy bastard off me!\\
110 - Man, I never heard that story.\\
111 - Wait, so how was Forman's mom?\\
112 - Well, at first she
was giving me nothing,\\
113 - but by the end
she was giving me something.\\
114 - Yeah, she's spunky!\\
115 - - Man, I'd kiss your mom.
- Oh, my God.\\
116 - How could Jackie's mother
abandon her only child?\\
117 - I have half a mind
to take this public.\\
118 - We could go on Donahue.\\
119 - No.
Go on Carson, he's funnier.\\
120 - One time, the animal guy was on,\\
121 - and his parrot dooked
right on Johnny's head.\\
122 - Dad, I think you're
missing the point.\\
123 - We need to find Jackie
some place to stay, you know?\\
124 - Where she won't be all alone.\\
125 - I can get her a room
at the hotel I work at.\\
126 - No, Jackie is not staying in a hotel.
We have an empty room right here.\\
127 - Kitty, every time we have an empty room,
you wanna fill it up with a stray child.\\
128 - You're like the old
lady who lived in a shoe.\\
129 - Did you just call me "old"?\\
130 - Okay.
Okay. Here's what I think.\\
131 - Oh, hey, everybody!
Mr. Nude has an opinion.\\
132 - I'm sure we're all interested
in what Mr. Nude has to say.\\
133 - Floor's all yours,\\
134 - Mr. Nude.\\
135 - Never mind.\\
136 - Well, I guess he was just
thinking about being nude.\\
137 - What is wrong with you people?\\
138 - There is nothing funny
about a teenage girl\\
139 - whose mother abandoned her.\\
140 - You know, we're all Jackie's got.
We can't just turn our backs on her.\\
141 - Donna, you're right.\\
142 - You tell Jackie
she can stay with us.\\
143 - What? No.
No, she can't stay with us.\\
144 - - Sure. She can stay
in your room with you.
- But...\\
145 - Oh, you're all
gonna pay for this!\\
146 - I can't believe my dad's making
me ask Jackie to move in with us.\\
147 - This is gonna be a nightmare.\\
148 - "Donna, where's your spirit?"\\
149 - "Donna, you're still hungry?"\\
150 - "Donna, your lumberjack head
is blocking out the sun."\\
151 - You know, I'm not too big,
all right? She is too small.\\
152 - Okay, just for the record,\\
153 - I don't sleep nude
for any disgusting reason.\\
154 - I'm just a hot sleeper.\\
155 - Okay, I'm not a hot sleeper.\\
156 - I'm 17 years old, okay? I sleep
right next door to the girl I love.\\
157 - Things occur to me, okay?\\
158 - If I'm already nude, you know,
I mean, it just saves time.\\
159 - Guys, Nina agreed
to let me meet her parents.\\
160 - And to seem completely normal,\\
161 - I've come up with the perfect
opening line for Nina's mother.\\
162 - "Hello, Mrs. Bartel, I can see
where Nina gets her lovely ass."\\
163 - You're so weird, man.\\
164 - You know what?
There's a way around that.\\
165 - I'm gonna make you so beautiful,\\
166 - that Nina's parents don't notice
how freaking weird you are.\\
167 - Being beautiful, that's
how I get away with stuff.\\
168 - Except my problem is,
I gotta tone it down,\\
169 - 'cause otherwise the
chick's mom gets interested.\\
170 - Then we got a big problem.\\
171 - Now, let's make you man-pretty.\\
172 - Okay. I've been thinking
about what to do with Jackie,\\
173 - and I think we're overlooking
the mobile home option. Okay?\\
174 - You could park her
right in the driveway,\\
175 - and we'll all know she's safe
in her own little steel box.\\
176 - Donna, what... You have to
let her stay with you. Come on.\\
177 - - She's your best friend.
- - She's not my best friend.\\
178 - Well,
then, who's your best friend?\\
179 - Oh, crap!
How the hell did that happen?\\
180 - Oh, look. Mr. Nude is helping.\\
181 - Mr. Nude, huh? That was
my nickname in college.\\
182 - Dad, you didn't go to college.\\
183 - Didn't stop me from
getting a nickname.\\
184 - Uh-huh. So, are you all
gonna be here for this?\\
185 - 'Cause I don't think Jackie's
gonna be cool with that.\\
186 - Well, Steven,
everybody needs support.\\
187 - Like this one time, I left the
supermarket in a really bad mood,\\
188 - and then I met these very
nice people, the Hare Krishnas.\\
189 - They sang me a song,
they gave me some rice.\\
190 - It was just
the little pickup I needed.\\
191 - You know, if I hadn't had to make
dinner, I might've gotten into their van.\\
192 - Yeah, those freaks
were hassling me once, too,\\
193 - so when they weren't looking,
I stole five boxes of Thin Mints.\\
194 - Kelso, those were Girl Scouts.\\
195 - Whatever, man.
They were pushy.\\
196 - Here comes Jackie.\\
197 - Well, I think this
is a big mistake,\\
198 - so when this blows up in your
face, don't come looking for me.\\
199 - I'll be busting up
Forman's space station again.\\
200 - Jackie. Jackie, Donna has
something she wants to ask you.\\
201 - Donna.\\
202 - So,
Jackie, we were all thinking\\
203 - that you might come
stay with me for a while,\\
204 - since you're having
such a hard time right now.\\
205 - God, I am so sick of this!
I don't have hard times!\\
206 - I'm Jackie Burkhart.\\
207 - I got voted head cheerleader by the
largest margin in cheerleader history.\\
208 - Okay? I have a wonderful life.\\
209 - Yeah, but, Jackie, your dad's
in prison, and your mom...\\
210 - Well, yeah, I'm sorry, Donna,\\
211 - but you're just not popular
enough for me to live with.\\
212 - I'm not popular enough?\\
213 - I was doing you a favor
'cause I felt bad for you.\\
214 - Well, don't, okay? I don't need
to be your good deed for the day.\\
215 - Fine. There's the door.\\
216 - Don't let it hit your popular
little butt on the way out.\\
217 - Fine.\\
218 - Well, that was pretty hot.\\
219 - ...and that is how you make
a canoe out of banana skins.\\
220 - Oh!\\
221 - They love me, see? There's
nothing to worry about.\\
222 - - Great,
then we should get going.
- Oh, oh, don't go.\\
223 - Oh, it's such a pleasure having
someone so exotic in our home.\\
224 - We're so happy that Nina
has made a friend of you, Fez.\\
225 - Well, maybe it's because I'm so
handsome, and not at all creepy.\\
226 - And, by the way, I see
where Nina gets her lovely ass.\\
227 - Hey, I was talking to you, Mr.
Bartel.\\
228 - Oh, my!\\
229 - Honey, you are really
broadening your horizons.\\
230 - Having a friend like this is gonna
look great on your college application.\\
231 - Yes, we always enjoy
meeting Nina's friends.\\
232 - Oh, you keep calling me her "friend."
Don't you mean, her "boyfriend"?\\
233 - Boyfriend?\\
234 - - What's so funny?
- Oh,
you can't be her boyfriend.\\
235 - - Why not?
- Because you're... What's the word, honey?\\
236 - - Different?
- Okay. Different.\\
237 - Oh, I see.\\
238 - - You mean, "not white."
- Fez, no.\\
239 - I think I'll be leaving now.
Good day.\\
240 - - Fez, wait...
- I said, "Good day."\\
241 - And by the way, I hope
you do not have a good day.\\
242 - And then when I asked her to live with
me, she said I'm not freaking popular.\\
243 - Am I not on the radio all
the time as "Hot Donna"?\\
244 - Okay? There are "Hot Donna"
posters all over town, objectifying me.\\
245 - Is Jackie being objectified?
No!\\
246 - She only said that 'cause you
embarrassed her in a room full of people.\\
247 - It was like a damn telethon in there.
The only thing missing was Jerry Lewis.\\
248 - So, what, it's my fault
'cause I didn't ask her right?\\
249 - Okay.
How about when your mom left?\\
250 - Think about how you would've felt if
you walked into a roomful of people,\\
251 - everyone's talking about how sad
your life is, and how much they pity you.\\
252 - Yeah, I guess I get that.\\
253 - I'm just saying that
Jackie needs a place to stay,\\
254 - and it'd be really cool\\
255 - if maybe you could ask her in a
way that doesn't make her feel bad.\\
256 - Fine.\\
257 - But she didn't have
to call me unpopular, okay?\\
258 - Unpopular girls don't get free
Slurpees from Tommy at the 7-Eleven.\\
259 - Donna, two years ago, Tommy tried
to jump a school bus on his moped.\\
260 - He didn't make it, and now he
gives everyone free Slurpees.\\
261 - So, you see, Jackie, the reason I
asked you to stay with me before,\\
262 - is because,
well, you were right.\\
263 - I am unpopular.\\
264 - Go on.\\
265 - I'm too tall,\\
266 - and... And red hair is gross.\\
267 - And, well,
if I don't do something soon,\\
268 - my unpopularity is
gonna follow me to college,\\
269 - unless you help.\\
270 - Please come stay with me.\\
271 - Jackie,\\
272 - help
me be more like you.\\
273 - Well, as long as everybody
knows I'm doing it for you,\\
274 - I'll do it.\\
275 - Great.\\
276 - Hey, Donna. Thank you.\\
277 - You're welcome.\\
278 - Okay. First things first.\\
279 - If you wanna be more popular,
you're gonna have to break up with Eric.\\
280 - What?\\
281 - You know, I have been called many
names since coming to this country,\\
282 - but I have never been
treated like that before.\\
283 - You know, Fez,\\
284 - unfortunately, there are
some people in this world\\
285 - that are gonna judge you
on the color of your skin,\\
286 - or your funny accent,\\
287 - or that girlie
little way you run.\\
288 - But you know what?
You're not alone.\\
289 - Why do you think
the Martians won't land here?\\
290 - 'Cause they're green, and they know
people are gonna make fun of them.\\
291 - You said it, brother.\\
292 - I just wish there was someplace in
the world where prejudice didn't exist.\\
293 - Well, that's Canada.\\
294 - Yup, good old Canada.\\
295 - They don't make
generalizations about people\\
296 - 'cause they're too busy
playing hockey, or getting drunk,\\
297 - or putting maple
syrup on their ham.\\
298 - - Fez, we need to talk.
- Hey! He might not
be from this country,\\
299 - but he's beautiful, damn it!\\
300 - Nina, our relationship is over.
My self-respect demands it,\\
301 - and there's nothing you can
say to make me change my mind.\\
302 - Fez, my parents are jerks,\\
303 - and I wanna get back at them
by doing it with you on their bed.\\
304 - Except that. Thanks, Kelso.\\
305 - Fire! Fire!\\
306 - - What are you doing?
- Well, look at this.\\
307 - Mr. Nude is still nude.\\
308 - - You're nuts.
- Wow.\\
309 - Strong words from Mr. Nude.\\
310 - We're doing this every night
until you put on some bottoms.\\
311 - Fire!\\
312 - Fire!
\subsection {Episode 20: No Quarter}
1 - Donna, you're so
sweet for letting Jackie\\
2 - live here with you
while her mom is...\\
3 - You know.\\
4 - Whoring around Mexico?\\
5 - Donna, that is not fair.\\
6 - I think she left Mexico.\\
7 - Well, you know, Jackie
and I might have fun.\\
8 - It's sort of like a slumber
party. Mmm-hmm.\\
9 - Yes, late-night girl-talk,\\
10 - hot oil massages,\\
11 - and the furtive whispers of,
"We shouldn't!"\\
12 - And then,
"Shh! It's okay!"\\
13 - Is that all you're bringing?\\
14 - Oh, just a couple
more small things.\\
15 - Out of the way, Jackie.\\
16 - Coming through!\\
17 - Got a buttload!\\
18 - Heavy.
Can't feel my fingers!\\
19 - Yup!\\
20 - Ooh.\\
21 - Jackie's panties!
Hey, Hyde.\\
22 - If these babies could talk,\\
23 - I bet they could tell some
pretty good stories about me!\\
24 - Yeah, I bet they'd have
a French accent, too.\\
25 - My girlfriend's panties, Kelso?\\
26 - Is that really a road
you wanna go down with me?\\
27 - What's that, panties?\\
28 - Oh, no, I can't
tell Hyde that one! Naughty panties!\\
29 - What's that, fist?
It would be my pleasure.\\
30 - Here you go. One
general-issue military cot,\\
31 - slightly used from my days
in the National Guard.\\
32 - Well, it's good to know
that the National Guard\\
33 - was getting a good night's sleep\\
34 - while I was in the South Pacific\\
35 - dodging bullets and
using coral as toilet paper!\\
36 - So, I don't think there's
gonna be room for everything.\\
37 - Oh, Donna, sure there will. I only
brought the stuff I absolutely needed.\\
38 - All right.
Where goes the horse?\\
39 - Guys, if I enroll in the
police academy in the fall,\\
40 - I can be busting heads
in a year!\\
41 - Freeze, dirtbag!\\
42 - Wow, you did make me freeze.\\
43 - But I was a dirtbag
long before you came along.\\
44 - Hey. Says here, you're supposed
to start getting into shape now.\\
45 - No, no, that's not for me.
That's for the regular guys.\\
46 - I haven't done
a lap in gym class\\
47 - since I had my
eighth-grade growth spurt,\\
48 - and Miss Brady made me
her special assistant.\\
49 - Guys, look at this. I just
got another collection letter\\
50 - from the jewelry store
about Donna's engagement ring.\\
51 - Man, I gotta get some money,
or I'm screwed.\\
52 - Well, there's a job
at the hotel.\\
53 - My boss would have hired you.
Then he talked to Red.\\
54 - Well, I gotta do something.
This is a very threatening letter.\\
55 - "Call us immediately"?\\
56 - It's in all capital letters.\\
57 - Look at you. Another dirtbag
dodging his responsibilities.\\
58 - Not on my beat.
Game over, dirtbag!\\
59 - Man,
I wish I had some handcuffs.\\
60 - Here, use mine!\\
61 - I'm learning to do magic.\\
62 - Hanging out\\
63 - Down the street\\
64 - The same old thing\\
65 - We did last week\\
66 - Not a thing to do\\
67 - But talk to you\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - We're all all right\\
70 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
71 - Jackie.\\
72 - I thought you were gonna
put everything away.\\
73 - I did. The hardest thing was
finding room for my shoes.\\
74 - But then I realized I could
just fit them inside your shoes.\\
75 - Uh-huh.\\
76 - Look, let's just get some sleep.\\
77 - Good night.
Good night.\\
78 - Jackie! Turn that off!\\
79 - See, Donna,
I need music to fall asleep.\\
80 - See, I wear earplugs
so I can just barely hear it,\\
81 - but it needs to be loud enough,\\
82 - because I like
the vibration on the bed.\\
83 - So, how am I supposed to
get to sleep?\\
84 - Think of something boring,
you know,\\
85 - like school, or Eric.\\
86 - Hey.\\
87 - I sold some of my albums to get some
money for Donna's engagement ring.\\
88 - Made three bucks.\\
89 - Which means I am...
Let me see, carry the one...\\
90 - Oh! Still completely screwed.\\
91 - They wouldn't take
Anne Murray's Greatest Hits?\\
92 - Is this whole crazy world
turning upside down?\\
93 - Hey, be nice to Anne, okay? She's
a beloved Canadian songstress.\\
94 - And I'm glad they
didn't take her, because,\\
95 - well, the worse I feel,
the more I need her.\\
96 - Why do you have money?\\
97 - What'd you do, mug a Girl Scout?\\
98 - No, I've been selling my albums.\\
99 - Oh, I hope you didn't sell that
Froggy Went A-Courtin' record.\\
100 - You know, when we were
toilet-training Eric,\\
101 - I'd say, "Does someone
need to go a-courtin'?"\\
102 - And he would just run
straight off and make a jobby.\\
103 - You know, it occurs to me
that since I paid the allowance\\
104 - that bought those records in
the first place, that money's mine.\\
105 - Well, it occurs to me that
possession is 9/10ths of the law.\\
106 - Keep up with the smart mouth,\\
107 - and my foot will be 9/10ths
of the way up your ass.\\
108 - You know, Forman,
you should write a book.\\
109 - Things My Father Threatened
To Put In My Ass.\\
110 - "Chapter One, His Foot."\\
111 - I'd buy that.\\
112 - Ew!\\
113 - Donna, don't you knock?\\
114 - Not when it's my room!\\
115 - Well, we're in here, so...\\
116 - Yeah, well, I'm in here, so...\\
117 - Hey, if you wanna watch,
I can get into that.\\
118 - Have a seat on the horse.\\
119 - Hey, how was your weekend, Roy?\\
120 - Oh, pretty good.\\
121 - Think I might have met a woman.\\
122 - Aw, that's great, man.\\
123 - She's staying at the hotel.\\
124 - When I took butter to her table,\\
125 - she looked right at me and said,\\
126 - "Took you long enough."\\
127 - Huh?\\
128 - All right! Here I am!\\
129 - Oh, Steven, meet our
new kitchen assistant.\\
130 - You hired Kelso?\\
131 - Do you know how many fires
this guy's started?\\
132 - Three electrical, two chemical,\\
133 - and one that even surprised me.\\
134 - Well, I wanted to help him out,\\
135 - and he said he needed a job.\\
136 - Yeah, if I'm gonna be a cop, I
gotta quit modeling, I mean...\\
137 - I can't have the perps looking
at pictures of me half-naked.\\
138 - Oh, and everywhere I work,
I like to feel at home,\\
139 - so I brought a little
something of Jackie's.\\
140 - Okay, I think that's
a health-code violation,\\
141 - but I'm gonna
look the other way,\\
142 - which is hard to do,
'cause, look, panties!\\
143 - Yeah, I burned you
with the panties again!\\
144 - Two days, two locations.
That burn is on tour.\\
145 - Yeah.\\
146 - I guess Roy didn't
make things clear, but,\\
147 - all new hires are on probation.\\
148 - So, at the end of the week, I
get to say whether you stay or go.\\
149 - Yeah, nice try.\\
150 - No, I'm serious, man,
it's all up to me.\\
151 - So you might wanna try
and get on my good side.\\
152 - Oh, excuse me.\\
153 - Yes, may I help you?\\
154 - Oh. Hello, Fez.\\
155 - Fenton.\\
156 - You two know each other?\\
157 - I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, there's nothing to say.\\
158 - You can say that again.
Don't tell me what to do.\\
159 - Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you? Maybe I would!\\
160 - Then there's nothing to say!\\
161 - Yeah.\\
162 - I have a question
about this letter.\\
163 - See, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make a ring payment anytime soon,\\
164 - so I was wondering if maybe we
could work out some kind of a deal.\\
165 - Fine. Here's a deal. You're gonna have
to come up with the money by Friday,\\
166 - or bring the ring
back to the store.\\
167 - What? Bring the ring back?
No, I can't do that.\\
168 - You can, and you will.
No later than 5:00.\\
169 - I have a party at 8:00.
I need the time to dress.\\
170 - Eric, you're going to
want to do what he says.\\
171 - I've been at the other
end of Fenton's stick,\\
172 - and believe me, that's
not a place you want to be.\\
173 - And even though
I ain't got money\\
174 - I'm so...\\
175 - Who am I kidding?\\
176 - After I can't pay
for Donna's ring,\\
177 - no one's gonna be in
love with me, honey.\\
178 - Must you mock me, Anne Murray?\\
179 - Kelso, because of
your panty shenanigans,\\
180 - I'm banning you from the circle.\\
181 - I hereby ban you!\\
182 - I also hereby eat your burrito.\\
183 - Hey, Hyde?
You're not the boss of me!\\
184 - Oh, right. Well, you
can't tell me what to do!\\
185 - Shoot.\\
186 - Well... Well, at least
I'm still my own man.\\
187 - No, I'm not!\\
188 - What do you suppose\\
189 - Jackie and Donna are doing
in the room right now?\\
190 - Combing each other's hair?\\
191 - Applying moisturizer
to their all-overness?\\
192 - Oh, to be a fly on that boob.\\
193 - All I know is, I gotta
go tell the woman I love\\
194 - that the ring I gave her
for all eternity,\\
195 - was actually for only
six-and-a-half weeks.\\
196 - Life's a little more complicated\\
197 - than one of your simple little
ditties, isn't it, Anne Murray?\\
198 - Anne Murray.\\
199 - What do you know
about hard times?\\
200 - Canada?\\
201 - You wanna borrow our shower?\\
202 - Jackie used up all our
hot water bathing her dolls.\\
203 - Normally, I'd rather hose off in the
driveway than ask you for a favor,\\
204 - but I'm afraid Bob will wanna
act out some car-wash fantasy.\\
205 - You got me there!\\
206 - Come on, Jo-Jo, we can save
water if we soap up together.\\
207 - And when they're done, I'm
retiling the whole damn bathroom.\\
208 - Okay, so\\
209 - you're absolutely positive
that my hairnet has to be pink?\\
210 - It's gotta match your apron.\\
211 - You're pretty.\\
212 - Jackie,
if you're gonna stay here,\\
213 - we need to set up
a few ground rules.\\
214 - Okay? You can't just...\\
215 - What happened to my
Led Zeppelin poster?\\
216 - Oh, I put up the Captain
& Tennille instead.\\
217 - No, no, no, no.\\
218 - No way is my Led Zeppelin
becoming The Captain & Tennille.\\
219 - Led Zeppelin wishes
they could be The Captain & Tennille.\\
220 - What did you say?\\
221 - Hey, Donna. I need to
talk to you for a second.\\
222 - I have been thinking all day\\
223 - about your eyes.\\
224 - What?\\
225 - Yeah, your eyes. They're
so beautiful and shiny.\\
226 - And, hey, you know
what else is shiny?\\
227 - This diamond ring
on your finger,\\
228 - which has to go back to the
store, because it isn't paid for.\\
229 - Because you can put a price
tag on a ring, but, you know,\\
230 - who can put
a price tag on your eyes?\\
231 - Only God, that's who.\\
232 - You're taking back my ring?\\
233 - Yeah. I'm sorry.\\
234 - I...\\
235 - Man, I wish there
were another way,\\
236 - but my dad won't
let me have a job, and...\\
237 - I mean, I can't
make the payments.\\
238 - God, I'm really sorry.\\
239 - Oh, it's okay, Eric.\\
240 - I mean,
it doesn't change\\
241 - the way we feel
about each other.\\
242 - As long as we have that,
I don't need a silly ring.\\
243 - Donna, you didn't
give me the ring.\\
244 - Yeah, I...
I thought you'd think I did.\\
245 - All right.\\
246 - Here.\\
247 - Donna, I promise,\\
248 - I'm gonna make this up to you.\\
249 - Okay.\\
250 - Donna,
you gave me a quarter.\\
251 - Mmm, fine.\\
252 - Hello, Mr. Forman.
And you.\\
253 - Shut your filthy mouth!\\
254 - Look, here it is.
Here's the ring back.\\
255 - Oh, honey, that's paid for.\\
256 - What?\\
257 - Someone came in and paid
through the end of next month.\\
258 - I'm not supposed to say who, but
she sure was a pretty little number.\\
259 - I guess.\\
260 - You know what?
It was Donna.\\
261 - I can't believe she'd go
behind my back like this!\\
262 - I cannot believe that this
man would go behind my back\\
263 - and take what was given
to me by God himself.\\
264 - All right, what happened
between you two, anyway?\\
265 - I'm too much of a man to say.\\
266 - But it involved a half-off sale,\\
267 - a crowded parking lot,
and a pair of pants\\
268 - that make my ass look
like an oil painting.\\
269 - If you mean, old and
cracked, then I agree.\\
270 - I'll see you in hell!\\
271 - Well, I'll be wearing
your pants!\\
272 - Okay, I'm feeling a little in
the way here, so... I'm... I'm...\\
273 - Oh, Roy. Hey, how's it
going with that hotel chick\\
274 - that was all over you,
asking for butter?\\
275 - Well, I had this idea
to surprise her with flowers,\\
276 - but when I did, she started
screaming and hitting me.\\
277 - And I guess the lesson is,
don't hide in someone's shower.\\
278 - I don't know what's wrong
with chicks, man.\\
279 - If I came home, and some
strange girl was in my shower,\\
280 - that would be
the greatest day of my life!\\
281 - Yeah!\\
282 - So, what are you doing?\\
283 - Oh, Hyde's making me
do his laundry.\\
284 - Then after this, I gotta
clean out the toilets,\\
285 - and hand-test
all the mousetraps.\\
286 - This probation period
is killing me.\\
287 - Did Hyde tell you there
was a probation period?\\
288 - Oh, man! That guy really
knows how to enjoy life!\\
289 - Wait. You mean,
Hyde's just messing with me?\\
290 - I don't have to worry
about getting fired?\\
291 - Well, if I didn't get fired for
hiding in some woman's shower,\\
292 - I think your job's secure.\\
293 - Hey, guys.\\
294 - Hey, Kelso, be careful, huh?
Some of those T-shirts are delicate.\\
295 - Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, man.
I'll be extra careful.\\
296 - I wouldn't want to do anything
to screw up my probation period!\\
297 - Hey! I wanna play!\\
298 - Come on, buddy.
Somebody spray me.\\
299 - Hey, Hyde, maybe you
could use these to dry off with.\\
300 - Probation period!\\
301 - Jackie read my diary,
Mrs. Forman.\\
302 - And she even wrote
little comments inside.\\
303 - Yeah, like, "Oh,
this could never happen."\\
304 - And... And, "Donna, that guy
was whistling at me, not you."\\
305 - I can't take it anymore!
I'm kicking her out.\\
306 - But, Donna, the poor
girl has nowhere to stay.\\
307 - She can't stay here!\\
308 - She can't stay
anywhere near here.\\
309 - Bob was in our shower again.\\
310 - This morning, I pulled
something out of our drain\\
311 - that I could not believe
came off a human body.\\
312 - Oh, Donna, there you are.\\
313 - Okay, look, we have to talk
about your makeup collection.\\
314 - Chapstick is not lipstick.\\
315 - Jackie, sit down.\\
316 - Look, we need to talk about
you and me living together, okay?\\
317 - Donna!
Because it's just...\\
318 - I just came from
the jewelry store.\\
319 - You can't pay for
your own engagement ring!\\
320 - This ring is from me to you, not
from me to you, paid for by you.\\
321 - That's like
cutting off my bal...\\
322 - ...lerina shoes.\\
323 - Eric, I didn't pay for the ring.\\
324 - Well, Fenton
at the jewelry store\\
325 - said there was
a pretty little number who...\\
326 - Oh, my God. Mom?\\
327 - You're the pretty little number.\\
328 - Well, I...
I do like hearing that\\
329 - once in a while.\\
330 - But it wasn't me.\\
331 - Well, I don't know, Dad,
some men might consider you...\\
332 - You just can't
stop talking, can you?\\
333 - Eric, I paid for the ring.\\
334 - What?
What?\\
335 - Look, Donna,
I read in your diary\\
336 - that you think I'm kind of
hard to live with,\\
337 - and, well,
I realized you were right.\\
338 - And I wanted to show you
that I know, and I'm sorry.\\
339 - And, well, thank you.\\
340 - Well, gosh, Jackie,
how very sweet, and\\
341 - uncharacteristic of you.\\
342 - Well, I know how much
you loved that ring,\\
343 - and I wanted to
do something nice.\\
344 - Wow, thanks.\\
345 - You know, Jackie, some
people, if they wanna be nice,\\
346 - they just actually start being
nicer on a day-to-day basis.\\
347 - Yeah, I figured it'd be
easier to write a check.\\
348 - Jackie! Jackie!\\
349 - I heard something
underneath my bed.\\
350 - Fez?\\
351 - Meow!\\
352 - Fez, the cat's outside.\\
353 - Woof, woof?\\
354 - Please, let me stay.
Please, let me stay.\\
355 - I promise I won't make a sound.\\
356 - Well, I do make some sounds,
but they're happy sounds!
\subsection {Episode 21: Trampled Under Foot}
1 - I'm telling you, the government
has a car that runs on water, man.\\
2 - They just don't want us to know,\\
3 - because then we'd
buy all the water.\\
4 - Then there'd be nothing left
to drink but beer.\\
5 - And the government knows
that beer will set us free.\\
6 - Hyde, you told us about
that car a million times.\\
7 - Can we please talk about
how hungry and horny I am?\\
8 - I wish I had a lady
made of pizza,\\
9 - or a pizza made of boobs!\\
10 - Yeah, hungry, check.
Horny, check.\\
11 - It's getting a little old, Fez.\\
12 - God, I feel like
I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?\\
13 - Remember when he was living on
Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?\\
14 - Just working on Uncle Owen's
water farm all day.\\
15 - Not even allowed to go
into Toshie Station\\
16 - to pick up some
power converters.\\
17 - Boring.\\
18 - Eric, enough with
the Star Wars crap!\\
19 - Whenever you talk
about that stuff, I frown,\\
20 - and when I frown,
my skin wrinkles,\\
21 - and if I get wrinkles,
my free ride is over.\\
22 - And I like my free ride!\\
23 - Yeah, we get it.
You're good looking.\\
24 - Look, doesn't anybody
have anything new to say?\\
25 - So, there's this car
that runs on water, man.\\
26 - It runs on water, man!\\
27 - Okay, Nina,
I brought you the special.\\
28 - One small soda,
one medium popcorn\\
29 - and one large Fez,
dark and sweet.\\
30 - Fez, you know I've had a lot
of fun hanging out with you.\\
31 - Hey, 37 times of fun,
to be exact.\\
32 - It would have been 38, but you
know... And then, again, I apologize.\\
33 - Now, enjoy your meal. If you
need me, I'll be smelling your neck.\\
34 - Fez, I'm starting to feel
like I need some space,\\
35 - but I want you to know,
it's not you, it's me.\\
36 - Okay. Well, I guess
tonight I'll be doing\\
37 - number 12,377 of
the other thing.\\
38 - That's sort of gross.\\
39 - Hey, it may be gross, but that's
the way I learned how to count.\\
40 - Hanging out\\
41 - Down the street\\
42 - The same old thing\\
43 - We did last week\\
44 - Not a thing to do\\
45 - But talk to you\\
46 - We're all all right\\
47 - We're all all right\\
48 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
49 - Six Million Dollar Man.\\
50 - That's, like, a $20 jumpsuit
and a $4 haircut.\\
51 - Mmm. Where did
all the money go?\\
52 - I think we've seen
this episode. Yeah.\\
53 - And we were sitting in these
exact same seats when we saw it.\\
54 - Actually,
you were sitting over there.\\
55 - I remember, 'cause
I could see up your skirt.\\
56 - You guys, we do the exact
same thing every day.\\
57 - TV, snack, nap. It's...\\
58 - You know what?
This isn't a basement,\\
59 - this is a nursing home.\\
60 - Oh, I know something
new we could do.\\
61 - Jackie, Donna, get naked.\\
62 - The rest of you guys back off
and give us some room.\\
63 - Hello, friends of Fez.\\
64 - Hi. Where's Nina?\\
65 - Oh, she don't wanna
hang out with me tonight.\\
66 - She said she needed some space.\\
67 - Ooh!\\
68 - Uh-oh.\\
69 - That's the same sound
you guys made\\
70 - when I told you I was gonna
grow my bangs out.\\
71 - Fez, when a girl
says she needs space,\\
72 - it means that she's dumping you.\\
73 - Oh, no, you don't understand.\\
74 - She said it was her and not me.\\
75 - Oh!\\
76 - That ain't good.\\
77 - Oh, what's the big deal?\\
78 - Oh, man, I can't tell him.\\
79 - This is a job for someone
who's cold, heartless\\
80 - and just inhuman.\\
81 - Jackie, go for it.\\
82 - Fez, when a girl says,
"It's not you, it's me",\\
83 - what she really means
is, it's you.\\
84 - So, I have really been dumped.\\
85 - Yep.\\
86 - Here's another tip. When a girl
says she just wants to be friends,\\
87 - it means she wants you to do stuff
for her, but she's not gonna put out.\\
88 - So, you know,
heads up on that one.\\
89 - Yep. Women will screw you
over every chance they get.\\
90 - That and breastfeeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.\\
91 - So, Haji's girlfriend
finally came to her senses.\\
92 - What happened? She
didn't wanna be a fifth wife?\\
93 - Haji.
All right.\\
94 - Well, it's her loss. The girls in
my Friday night cribbage game\\
95 - will be thrilled to have
Fez back at the table.\\
96 - You know what? At least Fez
has a social life. Look at us.\\
97 - We're hanging out
with my parents.\\
98 - Yeah, about that. Feel
free to get the hell out.\\
99 - Well, I mean, we
can do better than this.\\
100 - You guys, we're gonna
graduate in two months,\\
101 - and there is a whole town
out there just waiting for us.\\
102 - We just have to, you know,
grab the bull by the horns.\\
103 - Okay, but I tell you this
from experience.\\
104 - If we're gonna
mess with the bull,\\
105 - we'd better have an escape plan.\\
106 - Well, what are the
popular kids doing tonight?\\
107 - Well, I'll bet they're not
hanging around with their parents\\
108 - giving them snarky looks.\\
109 - Well, I remember when
the Brady kids got bored,\\
110 - and then that fat kid,
Oliver, showed up.\\
111 - It just all turned around. They
got in a pie fight and everything.\\
112 - You know what? Kelso might
actually be on to something.\\
113 - Maybe we should look for
someone new to hang out with.\\
114 - All right!
We're getting a fat kid!\\
115 - You know,
instead of adding someone,\\
116 - maybe you should think
about weeding out a few.\\
117 - Like you, and you, and you.\\
118 - I'm your son.\\
119 - I can't play favorites.\\
120 - You know, if you're looking for a
new friend, how about Lance Crawford?\\
121 - He's such a nice boy.\\
122 - Mom, Lance Crawford and I
hate each other.\\
123 - You're just obsessed with getting
his mother's peach cobbler recipe.\\
124 - Well, what kind of a woman
keeps a recipe a secret?\\
125 - If that recipe were the polio
vaccine, we'd all be in wheelchairs!\\
126 - I don't like Lance Crawford.\\
127 - He's always staring at me
in this really creepy way.\\
128 - And this one time, I saw him
fiddling around in my locker.\\
129 - When I opened it, there was a rose
inside, and my gym socks were missing.\\
130 - Donna, a little advice. You're
not gonna want those socks back.\\
131 - I can't think of anyone new
I wanna hang out with.\\
132 - All the girls I know are
either too snobby or too slutty.\\
133 - Yeah, I'm not good
with the snobs,\\
134 - but slutty's
my bread and butter.\\
135 - You know what we need are people\\
136 - with stuff to offer,
like Mark Herman.\\
137 - He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.\\
138 - Sold it last week.\\
139 - That punk. He's out.\\
140 - Hey, Carrie Gerber
has a trampoline.\\
141 - Carrie Gerber also
has a big hairy mole.\\
142 - I don't wanna be bouncing
around and get tangled up in that.\\
143 - Eric? Eric.\\
144 - Honey, there's someone here
to see you.\\
145 - Mom, if this another one of
Dad's Marine Corps recruiters,\\
146 - I'm gonna run away, I swear.\\
147 - Lance Crawford? Mom.\\
148 - Hello, Eric. Your father
and I were just discussing\\
149 - how unrealistically space
travel is portrayed in Star Wars.\\
150 - It was a long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.\\
151 - Look, you either
buy it, or you don't!\\
152 - What a lively conversation.\\
153 - I'll get some sodas.\\
154 - No, please, allow me.\\
155 - Why don't you stay here and chat
with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.\\
156 - Yes, I'd love to explain
the practical impossibility\\
157 - of the so-called lightsaber.\\
158 - You son of a...\\
159 - Red alert, you guys.
Red alert!\\
160 - Lance Crawford
is in the building!\\
161 - I'm getting the hell outta here!\\
162 - Wait, wait.\\
163 - What if he sees us sneaking out?\\
164 - Oh, Donna, leave one
of your socks behind.\\
165 - What? It'll distract him.\\
166 - Nina, I thought we were so
happy together. What happened?\\
167 - Fez, right now
I'm at a point in my...\\
168 - Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker.\\
169 - I want the truth!\\
170 - Okay, the truth is
you're too needy.\\
171 - Too needy?\\
172 - I'm sorry, but a man in
his sexual prime has needs.\\
173 - And you are lucky to have
such a stallion at your disposal.\\
174 - No, your needs are fine,\\
175 - it's your neediness
that's the problem.\\
176 - Then why didn't you say that?\\
177 - I didn't want you
to make a scene.\\
178 - You didn't want me
to make a scene?\\
179 - You didn't want me
to make a scene?\\
180 - Ha!\\
181 - You dump Fez! I dump
fries! There's your scene!\\
182 - Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.\\
183 - Oh, poor Fez. Too
depressed to leave his room.\\
184 - That's it. You guys,
we gotta cheer him up.\\
185 - Eric, knock first.\\
186 - If Fez is alone, I'm guessing
he's not wearing pants.\\
187 - Oh, awesome!
Wait. Let's catch him.\\
188 - Whoa!\\
189 - Check out all this great stuff.\\
190 - Oh my God.
Is that a race-car bed?\\
191 - Oh, I call shotgun!\\
192 - Hey!\\
193 - Oh! Fezzie,
come on out.\\
194 - I can't.
I'm not wearing pants.\\
195 - Told you!\\
196 - Nina told me why she dumped
me. She said I was too needy.\\
197 - Am I too needy? Tell me!
I need to know!\\
198 - Fez, I'm sorry, man.\\
199 - You're the definition of needy.\\
200 - Remember, one time, you
called me at 3:00 in the morning\\
201 - just to make sure
we were still friends?\\
202 - Look, if you wanna
get Nina back,\\
203 - you gotta act
like you don't care.\\
204 - But I don't know how to do that.\\
205 - Well, we can help you.\\
206 - Oh! We'll rebuild you like
the Six Million Dollar Man!\\
207 - Fez One to Control.
We have lift-off.\\
208 - All systems are go.\\
209 - Proceeding to eat candy.\\
210 - Uh-oh. Emergency! Emergency!
We are breaking up.\\
211 - I repeat,
Nina and I are breaking up.\\
212 - Fez, a teenager,
a boy with needs.\\
213 - Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
We have the technology.\\
214 - We can make him more appealing
to Nina, by making him less needy.\\
215 - We can make him cooler,
suaver, aloofer.\\
216 - "Aloofer"?
Is that even a word?\\
217 - We can make it one.
We have the technology.\\
218 - Initiate female
reaction sequence.\\
219 - Release the girls.\\
220 - Hey, Fez, looking good.\\
221 - Love the outfit.
Totally bionic.\\
222 - You mean nothing to me.\\
223 - Oh, no.\\
224 - He's no longer needy.\\
225 - And because of that,
I want him even more.\\
226 - Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.\\
227 - Terrific job.\\
228 - Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.\\
229 - Whoa. Doctor.
Whoa.\\
230 - Oh, I see.
In order to get Nina,\\
231 - I have to act like
I don't need her.\\
232 - Well, fine.
I don't need Nina.\\
233 - I don't need women.\\
234 - I don't need anything!\\
235 - Oh!\\
236 - Eric sure is taking an awfully
long time with those sodas.\\
237 - I'm sure it's no
reflection on you, Lance.\\
238 - He probably just wants to
make sure a good friend like you\\
239 - gets the freshest
soda available.\\
240 - I know Eric doesn't
like me, Mrs. Forman.\\
241 - I only came over for the chance
to see my beautiful Donna.\\
242 - And after I make
my fortune in robots,\\
243 - I'm gonna come back
to this Podunk town,\\
244 - buy whatever flour mill
Eric is working at,\\
245 - fire him,
and make Donna my wife.\\
246 - You're a creepy kid.
You know that?\\
247 - Mrs. Forman,
I think we both know\\
248 - the real reason you
invited me over here.\\
249 - You're after Mother's coveted
peach cobbler recipe, no?\\
250 - Your mom makes peach
cobbler? I had no idea.\\
251 - Please, let's speak frankly.\\
252 - I have something you want,
and you have something I want.\\
253 - We're not in a
position to just give you Donna.\\
254 - We could give you Eric.\\
255 - Mother tasted your stuffing at
the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot,\\
256 - and ever since then
she's wanted the recipe.\\
257 - I've been instructed
to arrange a swap.\\
258 - Don't you have any
weird friends to play with?\\
259 - Friends are for the weak.\\
260 - Okay, you guys.
Meet Julie.\\
261 - She's got two horses,
a brand-new Firebird,\\
262 - and her dad works for Six Flags!\\
263 - Hello, Julie!\\
264 - Hey, Hyde.
Love your hair.\\
265 - You can touch it if you want.\\
266 - Oh, get lost, skankoid.
We're all full.\\
267 - Damn, Jackie! She's got
a Firebird and two horses!\\
268 - We could've raced 'em!\\
269 - All right, that's it. I'm
gonna go ask Jake Bradley.\\
270 - I know, I know.
We've all been thinking it,\\
271 - but no one's had
the guts to ask him,\\
272 - 'cause he's the quarterback, and
we're just a bunch of jellyheads.\\
273 - But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.\\
274 - And that star is Jake
Bradley! Jake Bradley!\\
275 - All right, Fez. There's Nina.
Now remember, you're a new man.\\
276 - You don't need her,
or anything else.\\
277 - Got it. I am cooler,
suaver, aloofer.\\
278 - There you go.\\
279 - Oh, hi, Fez.\\
280 - Oh, you wish, baby.\\
281 - Why don't you take your "Hi, Fez"
act, and try it on someone else?\\
282 - 'Cause I don't need it.\\
283 - Nice work, Fez.\\
284 - Shut up. I don't
need your accolades.\\
285 - How can you give away
your stuffing recipe, Kitty?\\
286 - It's the one thing that we have\\
287 - that's better than
everyone else's.\\
288 - Our house? Crappier.\\
289 - Our son? Crappier.\\
290 - Our stuffing? Better!\\
291 - Okay, Lance.
Here you go.\\
292 - Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.\\
293 - Oh, you be sure to say hi.
Such a nice lady.\\
294 - Please, Mrs. Forman, there's
no need to keep up the charade.\\
295 - Fine. She's cold.
Get out.\\
296 - I just want you to know
that I don't need these fries.\\
297 - I choose to eat them because
I desire their salty taste.\\
298 - Please, just take the fries.\\
299 - You need me to
take them, don't you?\\
300 - Needy bastard.\\
301 - Hi, Fez.
Can I talk to you?\\
302 - Oh, you need permission, do you?\\
303 - I think I was a little too
hasty breaking up with you.\\
304 - Really?\\
305 - Yes. I like the new Fez.\\
306 - What about the old Fez?\\
307 - Not so much.\\
308 - You know what, Nina?\\
309 - There's only one Fez,\\
310 - and that is a Fez with needs.\\
311 - And if you don't like that,
then we shouldn't be together.\\
312 - But, Fez, I...
Shh!\\
313 - Sorry, baby.
It's over.\\
314 - Oh, and, Nina,
it's not me, it's you.\\
315 - Ladies of The Hub,\\
316 - why do we try to act
like we have no needs?\\
317 - I have needs.\\
318 - For instance, I need a date
for Saturday night. Any takers?\\
319 - You, blondie. You there,
with the glasses.\\
320 - What about the redhead
trying to cover her face?\\
321 - 12,378, here I come.\\
322 - Hey. So, I went
to see Jake Bradley.\\
323 - You mean Jake Bradley?\\
324 - Yes. To see if he
wanted to hang out.\\
325 - And you know what
Mr. Cool Guy was doing?\\
326 - Just hanging out in his
basement with his friends,\\
327 - and they were watching
The Six Million Dollar Man.\\
328 - It was eerie.\\
329 - Was there a skinny guy
dating this really hot chick\\
330 - who's way out of his league?\\
331 - You know, there was.\\
332 - Wait. Does this mean we're
not getting a fat kid to play with?\\
333 - No, man. We don't
need anyone else.\\
334 - You know what? We've only got
two months until graduation,\\
335 - and we can't waste
a second of that.\\
336 - Forman's right.
Let's seize the day, man.\\
337 - Hey, weren't we supposed
to seize something, man?\\
338 - You know what the Six
Million Dollar Man should have?\\
339 - A bionic nose.\\
340 - You could smell everything!\\
341 - Guys, all I know, is that we
should really appreciate this,\\
342 - 'cause I don't think we're gonna
be able to do this in college.\\
343 - This peach cobbler is amazing!\\
344 - Now, who would leave a whole pan\\
345 - of peach cobbler
just sitting on a counter?\\
346 - See?
We don't need anyone else.\\
347 - We have lots of interesting
things to say. Right?\\
348 - Hey, there's this car
that runs on water.\\
349 - It runs on water, man!\\
350 - Careful. I know it looks like a
race car, but it's really a bed.\\
351 - Please don't make a mess.\\
352 - The maid doesn't
come until Thursday.\\
353 - Watch it! That is a present
from my cousin in Hong Kong.\\
354 - Who has been dropping
Milk Duds on my carpet?\\
355 - Who has been dropping
Milk Duds on my carpet?\\
356 - Screw this.
I'm going to Eric's.
\subsection {Episode 22: You Shook Me (1)}
1 - Ah, the annual nurses'
convention.\\
2 - You know, according
to my bathroom reading,\\
3 - all nurses are actually horny
for high school boys.\\
4 - Why do you think those
hospital gowns have no backs?\\
5 - So the nurses
can check out your ass.\\
6 - Look at this sexy stampede!
It's like Wild Kingdom.\\
7 - I will stalk their
sexy herd like a lion.\\
8 - I cannot run as fast,\\
9 - but let's see a lion
put on this much cologne.\\
10 - All of my colleagues
gathered together\\
11 - to talk about health
and medicine...\\
12 - And to drink until their
livers turn into cocktail onions.\\
13 - Red, it is not that bad.\\
14 - What about last year, when you and
your buddies took the bellboy's pants?\\
15 - Well, they were all wet.\\
16 - Because you threw him
in the pool!\\
17 - Oh, hey, Roy.\\
18 - Hi, guys. Oh, stay away
from this batch of egg rolls.\\
19 - They were on the floor.\\
20 - Oh, you dropped them?\\
21 - No, I was lying down.\\
22 - You know, if I were God, this
is what heaven would be like,\\
23 - pretty girls in white,
and free egg rolls.\\
24 - Fez, I thought you said
heaven would be\\
25 - French maids with licorice
hair and gumdrop nipples.\\
26 - Oh, no, that's my 30th birthday.\\
27 - Hi, there.
So do you work here?\\
28 - Yeah. I'm stuck here
all night.\\
29 - That's good,\\
30 - 'cause I'll probably be doing some things
I'll regret later, if you're interested.\\
31 - Thanks for the offer,
but, uh, I have a girlfriend.\\
32 - What a coincidence.
I have a room.\\
33 - You know,
I don't have a girlfriend,\\
34 - but I have, uh, written
several love letters\\
35 - to Barbara Walters, so, uh...\\
36 - Roy, you're going
after the wrong ones, man.\\
37 - You gotta think like a lion\\
38 - and pick off the weakest
member of the herd.\\
39 - Look, like that one, with the
braces and the desperate eyes.\\
40 - Oh, she's not making it
past sundown.\\
41 - Aw, look at him,\\
42 - all tuckered out
from a day of chasing nurses.\\
43 - Yeah. It's like
a gigantic, horny baby.\\
44 - I bet he's having sweet dreams.\\
45 - Welcome to the clinic
for sexy foreigners.\\
46 - Tell me where it hurts, baby.\\
47 - Oh, I have a bad case
of horniness for nurses.\\
48 - What you need
is a sexy sponge bath.\\
49 - I like the way you operate.\\
50 - How's that?\\
51 - It's not bad.\\
52 - But I sure am.\\
53 - Yes, you are, naughty nurse.\\
54 - Maybe you need
a little spanking.\\
55 - Maybe I do.\\
56 - Now, why don't you
turn your head and cough?\\
57 - Oh, what's the problem, buddy?\\
58 - What's the problem, buddy?\\
59 - Hangin' out\\
60 - Down the street\\
61 - The same old thing\\
62 - We did last week\\
63 - Not a thing to do\\
64 - But talk to you\\
65 - We're all all right\\
66 - We're all all right\\
67 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
68 - So, anyways, Eric,
me and Joanne feel real bad\\
69 - since Red fired you.\\
70 - So we decided to get you a job\\
71 - on account of we're pretty sure\\
72 - you're not gonna be
successful on your own.\\
73 - Isn't that great?\\
74 - See, now you can save up for
school, and we can get married.\\
75 - Wow. I had heard
crazy rumors\\
76 - that sometimes parents
help children,\\
77 - but I just always thought it was
some kind of beautiful fairy tale.\\
78 - A position opened up
at my company,\\
79 - and it's yours if you want it.\\
80 - Oh, my God. I'll take it.
This is great!\\
81 - Yep. She's as generous in
real life as she is in the sack.\\
82 - Ugh!\\
83 - Wow, that's\\
84 - wildly inappropriate.\\
85 - So, Joanne, about my
new job...\\
86 - I don't even know
where you work.\\
87 - The dog food factory.\\
88 - The...\\
89 - The dog food factory.\\
90 - I didn't see that comin'.\\
91 - Hey.
Hey.\\
92 - How was your day?\\
93 - Ugh, it was brutal.\\
94 - How can nurses
wolf down mini pizzas\\
95 - right after watching
a film strip on butt rashes?\\
96 - Yeah. No, I know.\\
97 - Michael and I were
hanging at the hub,\\
98 - and he told me it's been tough.\\
99 - No, no, no. You don't need to
be hanging out with Kelso alone.\\
100 - Why not?
Because I don't trust him.\\
101 - Yeah, but don't you trust me?\\
102 - No!\\
103 - Haven't you been
paying attention?\\
104 - I don't trust anything.\\
105 - I don't trust the government.
I don't trust the newspapers.\\
106 - I'm not even sure that what
time we think it is right now\\
107 - is really what time it is.\\
108 - But most of all, I don't trust
you and Kelso alone together.\\
109 - All right. You know
what? I guess I deserve that.\\
110 - So I promise I won't be
alone with Michael anymore.\\
111 - However, I do think you're
making a big deal out of nothing.\\
112 - That's what you said after you
yelled, "Get off my boyfriend,"\\
113 - when you saw Kelso
kissing Annette.\\
114 - Okay, what do I have to do to
get you to stop bringing that up?\\
115 - I'm not doing that.\\
116 - Then I'm gonna keep
bringing it up.\\
117 - All right.
Let's play some ball.\\
118 - Why would you
slap me on the butt?\\
119 - Is there something about me
that would make you think\\
120 - that I, a boy, would
like you, another boy,\\
121 - to put his hand on my butt?\\
122 - Uh... No?\\
123 - Then keep your hands
to yourself, butt-slapper.\\
124 - Okay. Let's just
play some ball. Yeah.\\
125 - All right. Uh, me
and Fez are shirts,\\
126 - you and Donna be skins?\\
127 - Once again, Kelso, you're not
gonna fool me into being skins.\\
128 - Loosen up, Big D.\\
129 - Fine.
We'll be skins.\\
130 - Oh, look at Mr. Handsome
taking his shirt off.\\
131 - As if that was something that I would
dream about.\\
132 - Okay, what is your problem, man?\\
133 - It's just...\\
134 - Okay.\\
135 - Um...\\
136 - Has anyone ever had a dream
where you were with a girl?\\
137 - Oh, hell, yeah, Miss October.\\
138 - Hey!\\
139 - And... And you know
what I said to her? I said,\\
140 - "Get the hell out of my dream,
Miss October. I'm Donna's man."\\
141 - Now, has any of you
ever had a dream\\
142 - where you were with
the opposite of a girl?\\
143 - Like, two girls? Sure.\\
144 - See, I had a dream.\\
145 - And it was erotic.\\
146 - And it was about Kelso.\\
147 - What?
Wow!\\
148 - Wow!\\
149 - That is awesome!\\
150 - Fez, you gotta tell us
about this dream.\\
151 - No, you don't gotta!\\
152 - Look at him!\\
153 - He's undressing me
with his eyes right now!\\
154 - You undressed yourself,
you son of a bitch!\\
155 - Fez,\\
156 - tell us what happened.\\
157 - And... And don't be afraid
to use colorful words\\
158 - like "sweaty,"\\
159 - or "fondle," or
"forbidden." Go ahead.\\
160 - Well,\\
161 - Kelso was a nurse.\\
162 - And there was sponging.\\
163 - Oh!\\
164 - But, hey,\\
165 - maybe... Maybe
the dream continued,\\
166 - and we went to find some girls.\\
167 - Well, did it continue?
No.\\
168 - What could this mean?\\
169 - Well, isn't it obvious?\\
170 - It means that I'm gay!\\
171 - Why is the dog on the counter?\\
172 - He likes to be tall.\\
173 - Where are you off to, honey?\\
174 - Oh, I'm off to a little thing\\
175 - I like to call, "my new job".\\
176 - That's right. Despite
both your best efforts\\
177 - to keep me and Donna
from getting married,\\
178 - I can now afford to, because I got
a new job at the dog food factory.\\
179 - Dog food?\\
180 - Well, you finally made it, son!\\
181 - Hey, I'll have you know
I am the Coupon Liaison.\\
182 - Do you even know what
you're getting yourself into?\\
183 - When I pass that factory
on my way home from fishing,\\
184 - I hold a dead fish up to my face\\
185 - so I don't have to smell it.\\
186 - Seriously, honey, dog food?\\
187 - That is the worst part
of the cow.\\
188 - You won't last the day.\\
189 - I will last the day.
And you know what?\\
190 - Donna and I are getting married.\\
191 - And, I'm sorry, but just
because of your attitude,\\
192 - no one here will be getting the employee
family discount on Pupper Supper.\\
193 - Thank you very much.\\
194 - Jackie!
I need to talk to you.\\
195 - No. No, no,
you have to go.\\
196 - I cannot hang out with
you anymore, I promised.\\
197 - Jackie, I need to talk to you.\\
198 - Something happened that
could tear apart the group.\\
199 - I don't care, okay?
You have to go right now.\\
200 - Jackie, Fez had
a sex dream about me.\\
201 - You poor baby!\\
202 - What if he's in love with me?\\
203 - I don't know that I can
return those feelings.\\
204 - Well, of course you can't.\\
205 - I mean, sure, he's super cool,\\
206 - and he's good looking,\\
207 - and we have a ton in common.\\
208 - But I can't... I know.
I know, baby. I know.\\
209 - I just wonder what I did
to make this happen.\\
210 - I mean, should I have tried
to be less desirable?\\
211 - Michael, the beautiful
cannot be held responsible\\
212 - for the havoc our looks create.\\
213 - That's true.
Aw. Come here.\\
214 - No one understands me
like you do, Jackie.\\
215 - I told Jackie I don't want
her hanging out with Kelso.\\
216 - I walk in, they're
playing couch twister.\\
217 - I don't know if something
just happened,\\
218 - or if something was about to
happen, but you know what?\\
219 - I don't care anymore.\\
220 - Have you talked to her?\\
221 - No. Come on, man.
I'm done talkin'.\\
222 - I'm just glad I saw them.\\
223 - Now I can be the bigger person
and bail before she does.\\
224 - Yeah. That's what I should've
done with Lauren.\\
225 - And Susan.
And Janice.\\
226 - Ah, who am I kidding? I'm
just making these names up.\\
227 - Hey, Roy. I just need
to grab my check.\\
228 - Hey, Kelso, what the hell
were you doing with my girlfriend\\
229 - on Donna's couch?\\
230 - Oh, that wasn't me.\\
231 - I saw you!\\
232 - Oh. Uh...\\
233 - Uh, well...\\
234 - Okay, look,
it wasn't what you think.\\
235 - Um...\\
236 - It was totally different.\\
237 - See, Fez had this
sex dream about me,\\
238 - and I was, like, a nurse in it,\\
239 - and I was totally freakin' out.\\
240 - And Jackie was
just comforting me...\\
241 - I mean, 'cause, you know...\\
242 - Fez had
a sex dream about me.\\
243 - So your story is
that you were with Jackie\\
244 - because Fez had a boy-on-boy
dream about you?\\
245 - It's crazy, huh?\\
246 - Kelso,\\
247 - that is the worst lie
you've told\\
248 - since you claimed to be
the prince of South Carolina.\\
249 - No, I'm not lying
about Fez's dream!\\
250 - I was sponging him!\\
251 - It's the truth!\\
252 - Hey, I believe people
have dreams about you, man.\\
253 - I mean, put a blond wig
on you, you're Goldie Hawn.\\
254 - I know that.\\
255 - Oh! Mr. Red,
I need some advice.\\
256 - I had an erotic dream
about Kelso.\\
257 - Well, Joanne, thank you
for the factory tour.\\
258 - So, um, where is
the Coupon Liaison office?\\
259 - You're standing in it.\\
260 - Well, it's big.\\
261 - And look, you have a window.\\
262 - Maybe someday you can
climb up there and look out.\\
263 - Joanne, what exactly
is the Coupon Liaison?\\
264 - Oh. Oh, look, girls,
here's the boys.\\
265 - Hands off, though.
They're minors.\\
266 - Mrs. Kitty,\\
267 - we need your medical expertise.\\
268 - Honey, if you've got VD,
I'm not looking at it.\\
269 - No!\\
270 - Fez had a dream, and\\
271 - I was
doing stuff to him in it.\\
272 - And I don't
want to do it again.\\
273 - I'm scared to let him
go to sleep!\\
274 - See, Kelso was a nurse\\
275 - and I had no shirt,\\
276 - and he had a sponge...\\
277 - A soft one.\\
278 - Okay, boys,\\
279 - dreams are just compilations\\
280 - of what you experience
during the day.\\
281 - What did you do yesterday?\\
282 - Um, Kelso and I
looked at nurses.\\
283 - Um...\\
284 - Oh, and I ate 39 spicy egg
rolls that were on the floor.\\
285 - Well, spicy foods, there you go.\\
286 - You know, one time,\\
287 - I ate stuffed peppers
before I went to bed,\\
288 - and I dreamt that I ended a war\\
289 - by giving the Prime Minister
a belly dance.\\
290 - So my dream
didn't mean anything.\\
291 - Oh, thank God.\\
292 - I mean, I love you, Fez,
just not in that way.\\
293 - And my appreciation for
your beauty is purely aesthetic.\\
294 - You know what, Fez?\\
295 - Maybe right now
is not a great time\\
296 - for you to be
complimenting my ass.\\
297 - Well, if it isn't
the conquering hero,\\
298 - home from a big day of dog food.\\
299 - Hey, I had a great day, okay?\\
300 - And by the way, I'm nowhere
near the actual food.\\
301 - I'm off with, like,
the executives.\\
302 - Really?\\
303 - Well, Schotzie sure does
love the smell of executives.\\
304 - Okay, look.\\
305 - Okay, maybe Eric
is working with dog food.\\
306 - But he's not complaining
and he's not quitting,\\
307 - and we're gonna get married
no matter what you think,\\
308 - or how he smells.\\
309 - Aw. Thanks, honey.\\
310 - Don't touch me.
Okay.\\
311 - Look at you.\\
312 - You got that great
dog food job now.\\
313 - Plenty of dog food
money coming in...\\
314 - I mean...\\
315 - You two are happy, right?\\
316 - Very happy.
Yes.\\
317 - Of course you are.\\
318 - And that's why
I've changed my mind.\\
319 - This promising new career
in dog food has convinced me\\
320 - that you two are mature
enough to get married.\\
321 - What... Are you serious?\\
322 - Hey, let's get you happy kids
hitched as soon as possible,\\
323 - like next week!\\
324 - Next week?\\
325 - Wow, that's...
That's really soon.\\
326 - Yeah, well, sooner than we
thought. We were thinking, like...\\
327 - Someday.\\
328 - Yeah. Yeah, someday.
That's good. Yeah.\\
329 - Well, what's the matter?\\
330 - I mean, uh, getting engaged
is a silly, fun thing to do,\\
331 - but now that we're talking
about an actual wedding,\\
332 - you're turning into a couple of
dumb-ass kids who aren't ready?\\
333 - 'Cause, I mean,
if you're not ready,\\
334 - I mean, heck, I got myself
all excited for nothing.\\
335 - No, no. We're ready.
We are more than ready.\\
336 - We're ready?\\
337 - Well, I am if you are.\\
338 - Well, yeah.\\
339 - I mean, sure.
I'm completely ready.\\
340 - Well, that's great.\\
341 - You know, it's all settled.
I'll just...\\
342 - I'll go call the cake shop
right now.\\
343 - So it's, uh...
A wedding.\\
344 - Next week.
Right.\\
345 - Oh, I have some homework that
I... Yeah, I gotta clean my room.\\
346 - Hey, Roy, where's Steven? You
know, I haven't seen him all day.\\
347 - You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.\\
348 - Hyde saw you and Kelso
snuggled up on the couch.\\
349 - Tramp.\\
350 - Wait, what?\\
351 - Yeah, I said "tramp."\\
352 - Oh, my God,
I have to find Steven.\\
353 - Don't tell him
I called you a tramp.\\
354 - I bet Jackie's been fooling
around with Kelso this whole time.\\
355 - I feel like an idiot.\\
356 - Oh, my poor little
broody-brood.\\
357 - You know, when I first met you,\\
358 - you were such a cute little guy.\\
359 - And now you're...
You're a great, big guy\\
360 - with great, big hair and...\\
361 - And great, big problems, my
little broody-brood.\\
362 - Oh, wait, wait, wait.\\
363 - There.\\
364 - You may leave me now.\\
365 - Hey, there.\\
366 - Still have that girlfriend?\\
367 - You know what?
I don't know.\\
368 - Hmm. Let's go
talk about it.\\
369 - Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman,
have you seen Steven?\\
370 - Oh, honey, I've had
a couple sips of wine,\\
371 - and I don't remember.\\
372 - Oh, but you know what you need?\\
373 - You need more umbrellas
in your hair.\\
374 - Oh, bartender, we're
gonna need more umbrellas.\\
375 - Welcome to the clinic
for sexy Kelsos.\\
376 - What can I do for you?\\
377 - Well, I'm here
for my super sexy sponge bath.\\
378 - But I have money, so if
you do other stuff, too...\\
379 - Oh, I'll do
anything you want.\\
380 - You're one good-looking stud!\\
381 - Right back at you, handsome!
\subsection {Episode 23: Nobody's Fault But Mine (2)}
1 - Well, how are you this morning?\\
2 - Well, my baby boy's
still engaged.\\
3 - My hot flashes are back,
so I feel like\\
4 - I'm standing in
a pool of burning lava.\\
5 - They don't make a pill
for menopause,\\
6 - so I took a Flintstone vitamin.\\
7 - And when you take a pill
shaped like Barney Rubble,\\
8 - it's pretty obvious the
freaking thing ain't gonna work!\\
9 - Great. Anyway,
about the engagement\\
10 - I've got Eric and Donna
on the ropes.\\
11 - I dared them to get
married next week.\\
12 - They were shaking like France.\\
13 - Well, I know you like scaring
children, but what's the point?\\
14 - Well, the point is if we
let them do what they want\\
15 - they'll realize
they don't wanna do it.\\
16 - I mean, hell,
nobody wants to be married.\\
17 - Except me to you.
I'd do that all over again.\\
18 - Oh, is Steven here?\\
19 - He saw me on the couch
with Michael,\\
20 - but there was nothing going on.\\
21 - God, what do I do if he
doesn't believe me, Mr. Forman?\\
22 - When in the hell did
this start? I don't know.\\
23 - The kids all used to run from
me. That's the way I liked it.\\
24 - Well, next fall,
you'll get your wish.\\
25 - Eric will be in college, and then
the whole house will be empty.\\
26 - That's right.\\
27 - We're only one goodbye
away from heaven.\\
28 - Mommy, Daddy, I'm home!\\
29 - We gotta start
locking that door.\\
30 - No way!\\
31 - Hanging out\\
32 - Down the street\\
33 - The same old thing\\
34 - We did last week\\
35 - Not a thing to do\\
36 - But talk to you\\
37 - We're all all right\\
38 - We're all all right\\
39 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
40 - Donna. Hey.
Hi.\\
41 - Okay. If you had bad news
that could hurt someone\\
42 - that you cared about,
what would you do?\\
43 - Kelso, just leave the poor
girl an anonymous note\\
44 - and tell her she needs
a shot of penicillin.\\
45 - Donna. Okay.\\
46 - Someone I know cheated
on someone else I know.\\
47 - Did Eric cheat on me?\\
48 - I will snap that
little monkey like a twig!\\
49 - What? No! Donna.\\
50 - God, Eric didn't cheat on you.\\
51 - Hyde cheated on Jackie.
What? Oh, my God!\\
52 - Yeah!\\
53 - And he doesn't know it,
but I saw him\\
54 - kissing this lady in the hotel.\\
55 - Oh, my God.
That is horrible.\\
56 - I wanna do
the right thing, right?\\
57 - So I'm thinking that
I'll just tell Jackie.\\
58 - And then she'll feel really bad\\
59 - and I'll console her and presto!\\
60 - We'll be making out topless.\\
61 - No, Kelso.\\
62 - The thing to do is to
tell Hyde that you know\\
63 - and then give him
a chance to tell Jackie.\\
64 - I knew you'd say that.
You know, just once\\
65 - I want the right thing
and the topless thing\\
66 - to be the same thing.\\
67 - Well, if it isn't the lovebirds.\\
68 - So, lovebirds, how are the big
wedding plans coming along?\\
69 - Well, I've decided
to be the groom\\
70 - and, uh, Donna's
gonna go with bride.\\
71 - Well, your mom and I
have made some plans, too.\\
72 - We figure since we're already
giving you a graduation party,\\
73 - why not make it
a wedding party, too?\\
74 - Wait, graduation?\\
75 - That's in a week,
which is like...\\
76 - Seven days. I know
how long a week is.\\
77 - I know you know.\\
78 - Well, what's the matter?\\
79 - You two lovebirds still
wanna get married, don't you?\\
80 - I mean, heck, it'd be a real
shame if you chickened out.\\
81 - Then you'd be
a couple of love chickens.\\
82 - No. No,
we wanna get married.\\
83 - Right, Donna?\\
84 - Of course.\\
85 - I do.\\
86 - Well, then it's settled.
We're having a wedding.\\
87 - Oh, Donna, you can wear
my wedding dress.\\
88 - It's off-white,
so nobody will whisper.\\
89 - Okay. What is going on
with them anyway?\\
90 - Eric, if you need any help
dealing with Mom and Dad,\\
91 - I'm here for you.\\
92 - Yeah. No, thanks.\\
93 - Last time I trusted you,\\
94 - I wound up in the dryer with
a pillowcase full of bees, so...\\
95 - I know, and I am so sorry.\\
96 - I have been cruel to you, Eric.\\
97 - You too, Donna,
but it wasn't as obvious\\
98 - because I mostly said stuff
behind your back.\\
99 - Right back at you.\\
100 - I'm not just home for a visit.\\
101 - I am here to correct the mistakes
that I have made in the past.\\
102 - Okay, but I'm sure whatever
bastard children you've had\\
103 - have been adopted by now.\\
104 - Thank you.
Good luck to you.\\
105 - Hey, Fez.
I'm here to get my license.\\
106 - Oh, hello, Mitch.\\
107 - I'm here to tell you
that you will get nothing!\\
108 - Okay, I know we had
our problems in wood shop,\\
109 - but for the hundredth time,
I'm sorry I sat on your spice rack.\\
110 - You're sorry?
You should see my kitchen.\\
111 - There's spices everywhere.
It's anarchy.\\
112 - Dude, you're getting
hysterical like a woman.\\
113 - Well, if you mean that
I am artistic and sensitive\\
114 - and cry every time that I watch Love
Story, then, yes, I am like a woman.\\
115 - Now begone!\\
116 - You know, I could
make it worth your while\\
117 - if you would just
give me the license.\\
118 - I'm the editor of the school paper.
Can you imagine this headline?\\
119 - "Foreign Kid Actually Cool."\\
120 - 'Course, I'd have to retract it the
next day, because... Well, come on.\\
121 - Here's a headline for you,
"Short Kid Takes Long Walk."\\
122 - Well, hello, Hyde.\\
123 - I saw something very interesting
in the hotel this morning.\\
124 - Oh, the guy in the dress?\\
125 - That's Frank.
Comes in twice a month.\\
126 - Gets really pissed if you
don't call him Lady Laguna.\\
127 - No.\\
128 - I saw you kissing a girl
that wasn't Jackie.\\
129 - Oh, that.\\
130 - Ah, so you admit it.\\
131 - Sure.
Don't try to deny it.\\
132 - I won't.\\
133 - You're not gonna wiggle
your way outta this one!\\
134 - I'm not trying to.\\
135 - Look, I cheated on Jackie 'cause
she cheated on me with you.\\
136 - Which reminds me,
I ought to kick your ass.\\
137 - Well, Hyde, we weren't doing
anything. I already told you.\\
138 - Jackie was comforting me,\\
139 - 'cause I was upset, 'cause
Fez had a sex dream about me.\\
140 - Would you shut up
about that lame-ass story?\\
141 - Well, it's the truth, and I'll
prove it. Let's go ask Fez.\\
142 - Fine. You drive.
My van's in the shop.\\
143 - Fine. I need gas though.\\
144 - Fine. Can I borrow
money for fries?\\
145 - No.
Fine. Shotgun.\\
146 - There's only two of us,
you moron.\\
147 - Fine!\\
148 - You know what I think, Donna?\\
149 - I think this whole
"get married in a week" stuff\\
150 - is just Red trying to get us
to call the whole thing off.\\
151 - Yeah. But you know what?\\
152 - That ain't happening, missy.
You know what we're gonna do?\\
153 - We're gonna teach Red a lesson
and get married out of spite.\\
154 - Yeah, screw you, Red!\\
155 - Wow.\\
156 - It's every little girl's dream
to get married out of spite.\\
157 - You know what?\\
158 - I think maybe you're
not ready to get married.\\
159 - And if you're not, you
better tell me right now.\\
160 - Donna, I'm not ready.
Oh, thank God. Me neither.\\
161 - What?\\
162 - I thought you were ready.
I thought you were.\\
163 - I'm not.
Me neither.\\
164 - Oh, my God, you
are so hot. You are!\\
165 - Wow, nothing hits the spot
after an hour and a half of passion\\
166 - like chili cheese fries.\\
167 - Oh, hello, Mitch.\\
168 - Had a nice walk over here?\\
169 - Get used to it because
you'll never get a license.\\
170 - Do you understand me?\\
171 - No, but nobody understands you.\\
172 - You talk like Mushmouth
from Fat Albert.\\
173 - You just dug your
own grave, fella.\\
174 - What? "I flug
my own rave, bella"?\\
175 - Was that what you said,
Mushmouth?\\
176 - All right, Fez.
I need you to tell Hyde\\
177 - about the dream
you had about me.\\
178 - What?\\
179 - I didn't have any dream.\\
180 - We have a visitor.\\
181 - Fez, this is
really important, okay?\\
182 - So start talking, or so help me,\\
183 - I'll give you the worst
purple nurple you've ever had.\\
184 - Okay. In my dream,
Kelso was dressed as a nurse,\\
185 - and he was giving me
a sponge bath.\\
186 - And?\\
187 - I was nude.\\
188 - See? I was really
freaked out\\
189 - and Jackie and me
were just talking, that's all.\\
190 - So I just cheated on
Jackie for nothing?\\
191 - It's what I've been
telling you, man.\\
192 - Oh, Steven, look, okay?\\
193 - Whatever you think happened
between me and Michael,\\
194 - did not happen, okay?\\
195 - So, everything's fine.\\
196 - Actually, we need to talk.\\
197 - You know, I really hate to run,\\
198 - but I gotta go tell
the whole school about\\
199 - you and Nurse Ding-a-ling's
sponge bath.\\
200 - So, I gotta go.
You wouldn't.\\
201 - Move your lips, Mushmouth!\\
202 - So, I was in the den, and
Michael came over all upset.\\
203 - Jackie. And, Steven,
I asked him to leave.\\
204 - And that's when
you saw us. Jackie.\\
205 - But I swear, nothing
happened. Jackie!\\
206 - Stop talking.\\
207 - Look, I know all this now, okay?\\
208 - But before I knew, I
was at the hotel last night.\\
209 - And I was really mad.\\
210 - There was this nurse.\\
211 - And...
And what?\\
212 - And I'm really sorry, okay?\\
213 - I promise it'll never
happen again.\\
214 - You know, that's exactly
what Michael used to say.\\
215 - Come on, Jackie.\\
216 - No. You know what,
Steven? I'm sorry.\\
217 - It's over.\\
218 - Huh.\\
219 - I finally get country music.\\
220 - Donna, look,
it's my old wedding dress.\\
221 - Oh, and you can wear it\\
222 - as a bib.\\
223 - Hey, and for the reception,
I got the guys\\
224 - back together from
my high school band,\\
225 - the Pinciotti Polka Explosion.\\
226 - Won't be long now until you
two lovebirds are married forever.\\
227 - No escape.\\
228 - Until one of you is dead.\\
229 - So, you guys, I've been trying
to think of ways to help you.\\
230 - Okay. Where's Laurie?\\
231 - Yeah, what happened to you?\\
232 - You guys, living in Chicago
opened my eyes.\\
233 - I had no job, no friends.\\
234 - I did sleep with
one of the White Sox,\\
235 - but then it turned out to be just
this frat guy wearing a White Sox hat.\\
236 - Basically, I hit rock bottom.\\
237 - Really. God, I was so
sure you'd be a senator.\\
238 - Eric, love is hard to find.\\
239 - And I've realized
I've been taking\\
240 - the people who
love me for granted.\\
241 - Especially you.\\
242 - Oh, that's not true.\\
243 - I don't love you.\\
244 - Yes, you do.\\
245 - And if you two love each other,\\
246 - but Red is making you miserable\\
247 - then there's only one answer.\\
248 - Get out. Leave town.\\
249 - Because love is precious.\\
250 - Well, it sounds good\\
251 - but I can't help but remember
the feeling of being stung by bees\\
252 - as I tumbled around and around.\\
253 - Wait. Is that a tear?\\
254 - Oh, my God, Eric.
I think she's being sincere.\\
255 - Oh, my God, it's real.\\
256 - I have a sister.\\
257 - Hey, look who I found.\\
258 - At first I just thought
he was a leprechaun.\\
259 - Fez, I came over here because
I wanna end this feud, okay?\\
260 - Right here, right now.\\
261 - And if you're not on board,
I could spread your crazy\\
262 - naked, homoerotic dream
all over school, but...\\
263 - Macho as I am\\
264 - who would believe you?\\
265 - Okay, Fez.\\
266 - Uh, can I just say as the nurse\\
267 - that was sponging you
in your dream\\
268 - that I'm with Mitch here
on the whole\\
269 - "not spreading it
around the school" thing.\\
270 - See, your lady friend
here understands.\\
271 - Truce?\\
272 - Well...\\
273 - I guess.\\
274 - Truce. Good. Here.
Peace offering. Moron!\\
275 - Oh, this is
tomorrow's school paper.\\
276 - Oh, my God, on the front page\\
277 - there's a picture of me
kissing Kelso by the lake.\\
278 - Fez, why are you kissing
Kelso by the lake?\\
279 - We caught a fish!\\
280 - I was excited!\\
281 - I kissed the fish too, but, of
course, they don't show you that.\\
282 - Jackie. Jackie.
It's Hyde.\\
283 - No.
Yes.\\
284 - No.
Yes.\\
285 - Fine.\\
286 - Can I say something?\\
287 - I think this whole thing
was a misunderstanding.\\
288 - Hyde didn't know
what was going on.\\
289 - I know, okay?
But after Michael\\
290 - I promised myself
that I would never be\\
291 - with another boy
who cheated on me.\\
292 - But Hyde's so good for you.
Since you started dating him\\
293 - you've completely stopped
quoting Nancy Drew.\\
294 - And the worst part is
I still love him.\\
295 - I know.\\
296 - You know, normally, I
wouldn't cry on your sweater\\
297 - because, you know,
it ruins the fabric.\\
298 - But, God, this one's just
so cheap, it won't matter.\\
299 - What?
Nothing.\\
300 - Just, you know,
Jackie's single now.\\
301 - Yeah, so?\\
302 - So, when you were going
out with her, I backed off.\\
303 - You backed off?\\
304 - You constantly hit on her.\\
305 - You bought her presents all the
time. You shot me with a BB gun.\\
306 - Yeah, that's me backing off.\\
307 - Look, Hyde,\\
308 - I know you thought I only
wanted her because you had her.\\
309 - See, the thing is
now you don't have her\\
310 - and I still want her.\\
311 - So, as your friend, I'm just letting
you know that I'm going after her.\\
312 - And also, I'll be making
out with her in front of you.\\
313 - Just to rub it in.\\
314 - So be ready for that.\\
315 - Whatever.\\
316 - Yep, that's what
I'm counting on.\\
317 - While I'm out there
getting Jackie back,\\
318 - you're gonna sit around
here saying, "Whatever."\\
319 - Are you listening
to country music, man?\\
320 - Whatever.\\
321 - Look, Mom, Dad, Donna and I
have something we wanna say.\\
322 - Um, it turns out we're
not ready to get married.\\
323 - No!\\
324 - And I was really rooting
for you two crazy kids.\\
325 - Look, we know you've been
pressuring us into marriage,\\
326 - so we'd admit you were
right and live on your terms.\\
327 - But that's just
not gonna happen.\\
328 - So, we've decided to move
away as soon as we graduate.\\
329 - Move away?\\
330 - No, no, no, you can't
move away yet.\\
331 - No, we were gonna use this
summer to become best friends.\\
332 - Look, we'll be going to
college in the fall anyway.\\
333 - Instead of fighting with you
guys for the next three months,\\
334 - we're just gonna get
our own place in Madison.\\
335 - Yeah, good luck trying
to control us in Madison.\\
336 - Hey, Donna, remember we agreed
not to do that. Remember? Okay.\\
337 - Anyway, we're gonna have
our own apartment.\\
338 - And, honestly, I just think
we'll all be a lot happier.\\
339 - Madison has two movie theaters.\\
340 - Okay, Donna, come on.\\
341 - Oh, great plan, Red.\\
342 - Now my baby's leaving.\\
343 - I'm still here, Mommy.\\
344 - Yeah, well, that's nice.\\
345 - Hey.\\
346 - The thing is I'm really sorry.\\
347 - Yeah, you said that already.\\
348 - Come on, Jackie.
I made a mistake, okay?\\
349 - It was a stupid one-time thing.\\
350 - You know what, Steven?
I have heard it all before.\\
351 - From you, from Michael.\\
352 - God, just do me a favor
and leave me alone.\\
353 - Whatever.\\
354 - Jackie.\\
355 - I love you.\\
356 - Yeah, well, I don't love you.\\
357 - Here's your car license,
motorcycle license,\\
358 - boat license, license
to operate a forklift,\\
359 - a cut-the-line pass
and a free DMV pen.\\
360 - If you turn it over,
the little car parallel parks.\\
361 - Oh. And here's the negatives
of you and Kelso\\
362 - grabbing each other's asses.\\
363 - Hey, we were happy
because we caught a fish.\\
364 - If they do it in football,
why can't we do it in fishing?\\
365 - "Blue bit bushball
in bishing"? What?\\
366 - Where you from, man?
\subsection {Episode 24: The Immigrant Song}
1 - Okay, Eric, get a good
look at me in my uniform\\
2 - because today,
it's my last day wearing it.\\
3 - What? No. No!\\
4 - Ah! We never got to do
the trampoline thing.\\
5 - Hey, I'm done
with Catholic school.\\
6 - And my dad fixed it so I can
graduate at Point Place with you guys.\\
7 - My best memories
are under that skirt.\\
8 - Hey, Mom?
Where's Daddy? I need $20.\\
9 - - For what?
- In an effort to
clean up my act,\\
10 - I'm buying my own drinks now.\\
11 - Well, he's not home.\\
12 - When Eric told him about his little plan to
move away with Donna after graduation,\\
13 - your father went fishing.\\
14 - - What?
- No!\\
15 - What the big deal? You
guys are really freaking me out.\\
16 - My dad only goes fishing
when he's, like, super pissed.\\
17 - I think something about stabbing a worm
over and over again with a hook is, like,\\
18 - therapeutic for him.\\
19 - Yeah. He fished for three whole days
when he found out about me and the mayor.\\
20 - - What?
- Eric's moving away!\\
21 - That's right. And that's
why your father's angry.\\
22 - This is your way
of acting grown-up?\\
23 - Grown-ups don't just leave the
comfort of their parents' home to...\\
24 - To move to a new city,
and start a life!\\
25 - Well, maybe not in the 1930s.\\
26 - '40s.\\
27 - God, you're so young!\\
28 - Well, I think this is nuts.
Don't you just think this is nuts?\\
29 - The
whole thing is just... Just nuts!\\
30 - Mom, I kind of think
you're the one who's being...\\
31 - Oh, if you say I'm nuts, you're
going right through that sliding door.\\
32 - I don't enjoy telling you this,\\
33 - but you just wait
until your father gets home.\\
34 - I did enjoy that.\\
35 - This is all your fault.\\
36 - Yeah. Hey,
Laurie, quick impression.\\
37 - Who am I? "Hey, Eric, why don't you
tell Dad you're moving after graduation\\
38 - "so he'll kill you, and I can reclaim
my rightful place as the chosen one?"\\
39 - Eric, you don't understand.
This time I actually meant well.\\
40 - That's what you
said at the county fair\\
41 - after you locked me in
the porta-potty with a goat.\\
42 - - He was friendly.
- He was horny!\\
43 - Hey, Jackie.\\
44 - - Michael, what do you want?
- I think the question is,
what do you want?\\
45 - And I'm pretty sure
the answer is pink jellybeans.\\
46 - Now, they used to be pink and white
jellybeans, but I ate all the white ones\\
47 - 'cause I know you don't
like things that taste white.\\
48 - Okay. Look. Michael, just
because Steven and I broke up\\
49 - does not mean I want you
throwing yourself at me.\\
50 - Oh, Jackie, this is the
new and improved Michael.\\
51 - Okay? I'm not throwing anything at you
except for happy thoughts and jellybeans.\\
52 - Like, sex is, like, the
furthest thing from my mind.\\
53 - So,\\
54 - it's really over
between you two, huh?\\
55 - Yeah. Yeah, I think it is.\\
56 - - So, why do we
still have clothes on?
- Oh, God. Michael, get out!\\
57 - Oh, Jackie, I'm talking about
our emotional clothes.\\
58 - Okay, look, I know I've made
mistakes in the past, okay?\\
59 - But I've changed, and I just want
you to get to know the new me.\\
60 - Yeah, the new you, huh? What
does the new you cheat with,\\
61 - every skank who throws
her fat, furry butt at you?\\
62 - Jackie, no one I ever cheated
with had a fat, furry butt!\\
63 - If anything,
it was one or the other.\\
64 - But, look, all that is over,
okay? It's finito, the end-o.\\
65 - - I don't believe you.
- Well, it's the truth.\\
66 - Okay. Fine, Michael, whatever, okay?
Let's just see how things go from here.\\
67 - - Great. Let's get naked.
- Oh! Michael!\\
68 - No, like, friendly naked,
like two girls in a sauna.\\
69 - You
are such a freak.\\
70 - Okay, look, just at least take a jellybean?
Okay? I bought them just for you.\\
71 - Well, that was very sweet.\\
72 - There you are! Give me back
my jellybeans, you son of a bitch!\\
73 - Hanging out\\
74 - Down the street\\
75 - The same old thing\\
76 - We did last week\\
77 - Not a thing to do\\
78 - But talk to you\\
79 - We're all all right\\
80 - We're all all right\\
81 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
82 - Okay, now cross and
uncross your legs.\\
83 - Hmm...\\
84 - Hmm.
Okay, now make a face like...\\
85 - Like, "Oops,
did I do something bad?"\\
86 - Okay, now crawl to me.
Good, good.\\
87 - Now crawl away from me.
Ooh, sexy.\\
88 - Come on, Donna, throw him a bone,
huh? There's only so much satisfaction\\
89 - the kid can get from the back
of a pantyhose package.\\
90 - Yes, Donna, I have a lot to do.\\
91 - After this, I have to get Lindsay
Wolfe to sign my yearbook,\\
92 - then show her that she's actually signed
a pledge to do it with me three times.\\
93 - Why three?\\
94 - Well, because the first
time I'll be nervous,\\
95 - and then the second time I'll have
to please her because I got nervous,\\
96 - and then the third time... The
third time is when I get funky.\\
97 - - Jackie...
- No, no. Steven,
I'm not here to see you.\\
98 - Okay?
I'm just here to see Donna.\\
99 - Look, I told you I'm sorry, and I made
a mistake. Can we just talk, please?\\
100 - Talk about what? You cheated on
me. Okay? It's over. I feel nothing.\\
101 - Ooh, bitchy.\\
102 - You know what? Donna,
I'll just see you next door.\\
103 - - Ouch!
- Are you okay?\\
104 - Fez!\\
105 - Panties! Panties!\\
106 - The sacred senior prank where
we vandalize the water tower.\\
107 - I've been waiting
for this moment since,\\
108 - well, the last time
we vandalized the water tower.\\
109 - So, Hyde,\\
110 - - gave Jackie some
jellybeans today.
- Who cares?\\
111 - Well, you should
because they were pink\\
112 - and that is the bean of love.\\
113 - And I got her that particular bean
because I never stopped loving her.\\
114 - Yeah,
well, you stopped long enough\\
115 - to cheat on her with Pam
Macey, Laurie and Annette.\\
116 - Who else am I forgetting?\\
117 - There
were many others,\\
118 - but you cheated on
her with a nurse!\\
119 - It was a misunderstanding
that you caused.\\
120 - - That's it. Let's go.
- Oh, yeah? I'm ready.\\
121 - I hope you got that
nurse's phone number\\
122 - 'cause you're gonna need it
when I'm done with you.\\
123 - Hey, stop it, stop it!\\
124 - You two need to grow up and start
painting genitals on the water tower.\\
125 - - Fine. I'll be over here.
- Fine. I'll be over here.\\
126 - Well, since I have never seen another
man's genitals, I'll have to paint my own.\\
127 - In that case,
I'll need more paint.\\
128 - And a bigger tower.\\
129 - Kelso, what are you writing?\\
130 - - "Michael plus Jackie."
- I'm kicking your ass!\\
131 - You can't kick
my ass from down there,\\
132 - all you can do is punch my ass.\\
133 - - Hey, get down!
- Just face the fact, Hyde.\\
134 - You're down there and I'm
up here, and I am invincible.\\
135 - Kelso, are you okay?\\
136 - I think I fell!\\
137 - - I'm gonna go check on him.
- Okay.\\
138 - Okay, I think he'll be fine.\\
139 - Now, let's see.
Where do I begin?\\
140 - I want it to look like
it's coming right at me.\\
141 - This is
the Point Place Police Department.\\
142 - You're under arrest.\\
143 - Um...\\
144 - I am a painter from
a foreign country,\\
145 - and this is my gift to America.\\
146 - Get off the water tower!\\
147 - People of America,\\
148 - I give you Genitals In The Sky.\\
149 - - You hear that?
- Sounded like your dad's car.\\
150 - Run for it.\\
151 - No, you don't. You made your
bed, now you have to lie in it.\\
152 - Oh, who am I kidding?
You never make your bed.\\
153 - Eric, wait. Listen. If you leave
now, you'll never get back in.\\
154 - That means goodbye to
your clothes, your furniture...\\
155 - My G.I. Joes.\\
156 - We stay.\\
157 - Everybody in the living room.\\
158 - You're
gonna get it. You're gonna get it.\\
159 - Lay it on him, Red.\\
160 - While I was fishing,
I had a lot of time to think.\\
161 - - That's right!
- And all that
thinking made me very angry.\\
162 - Very angry!\\
163 - And the fish that were unlucky
enough to cross my path...\\
164 - Well, you know how they say
that fish can't feel pain?\\
165 - That's a load of crap.\\
166 - A big load!\\
167 - And I finally
came to a conclusion\\
168 - that someone in this room
is not going to like.\\
169 - That's you, porky mouth.\\
170 - Eric,\\
171 - I'm proud of you.\\
172 - And that goes double for...
What the hell did you say?\\
173 - I did everything I could to
stop you from getting married,\\
174 - but you stuck to your guns.\\
175 - And I admire that you're
willing to go out on your own.\\
176 - You're a man now,
and you have my blessing.\\
177 - This is like The Godfather.\\
178 - I think you have
to kiss his ring.\\
179 - How can you just give in
and let Eric leave home?\\
180 - He has defied you over and over.
He's a lying, cheating, conniving liar,\\
181 - and I won't let you send
my precious baby boy away!\\
182 - Kitty, my mind is made up.\\
183 - Eric, we're gonna pay
for your college, too.\\
184 - Really?\\
185 - Dad, I don't know
what to say to you except\\
186 - you're great!\\
187 - That's all right, Son.
We don't do that here.\\
188 - Okay, well, well, this is nice.\\
189 - Since we're all happy, Eric doesn't
have to leave three months early.\\
190 - He can go to school in
the fall like everyone else.\\
191 - We can take a pottery class!\\
192 - No, Kitty, he's leaving.\\
193 - No pottery class,
no mother-son dancing lessons,\\
194 - no trying out for Family Feud.\\
195 - But this deal is only good if you stay
focused. If you do something stupid,\\
196 - like get Donna pregnant,
you're on your own.\\
197 - Then I guess this is a bad
time to give you the news.\\
198 - I'm kidding!
I'm just so giddy!\\
199 - - So, it's just a sprain, huh?
- Yeah,
it doesn't hurt too bad.\\
200 - I guess the best part is I've now
fallen off the water tower in every grade.\\
201 - That record will stand
until your son goes to school.\\
202 - Thanks for driving me
to the hospital, man.\\
203 - Oh, whatever.\\
204 - No. Not "whatever."\\
205 - I mean, look, you drove me
because we've been buds forever.\\
206 - I mean, it's like, why are
we fighting over a girl, man?\\
207 - Remember in third grade when
we were both in love with Miss Hamill\\
208 - and we fought over her?\\
209 - And then after you pulled my head out of
the toilet and I let go of your bean bags,\\
210 - we made a pact to never
fight over a girl again.\\
211 - Yeah, you're right, man.\\
212 - I mean, neither of us
has a shot with Jackie anyway,\\
213 - - so I'm stepping back.
- No. No, no. You go
for it, I'll step back.\\
214 - No, I'm serious.
Door is open for you.\\
215 - No, I'm serious.
The door is open for you.\\
216 - I just closed the door for me!\\
217 - Well, I'm closing
the door for me,\\
218 - and I'm locking myself inside,
and I'm swallowing the key!\\
219 - Fine. We're both done
with her. You're my bud.\\
220 - You're my bud. Aah!\\
221 - I was wondering if that
would work, and it did.\\
222 - - Steven! Are you okay?
- Why?\\
223 - Well, I heard someone fell off
the water tower,\\
224 - - and I thought it
could be you. I just...
- No, it was Kelso.\\
225 - Wait. You came down here
'cause you were worried about me.\\
226 - No, I didn't.\\
227 - 'Cause you still care about me.\\
228 - Uh-uh.\\
229 - - So,
I still have a shot with you.
- No. No, you don't.\\
230 - I mean, okay, I don't know.\\
231 - Steven, stop staring
at me or I'll kick you.\\
232 - Aah!\\
233 - Jackie, hope you didn't
come here to make love to me.\\
234 - - No, Michael. I...
- 'Cause I'm fine.\\
235 - All I need is my buddy Hyde.\\
236 - And no chick is gonna
come between us anymore.\\
237 - - Right, Hyde?
- Uh, yeah.\\
238 - Yeah.
Let's go, buddy Hyde. Aah!\\
239 - Look at all the apartments
they have in Madison.\\
240 - - This place even
pays utilities.
- Oh, cool.\\
241 - What are utilities?\\
242 - - I think it's,
like, gas and water.
- Free water?\\
243 - You know what that means.\\
244 - Free ice.\\
245 - What are you two doing?\\
246 - Oh, we're looking for
apartments in Madison.\\
247 - I can't believe it. It's, like,
we leave in less than a week.\\
248 - Are you trying to kill me?
Because that's what you're doing.\\
249 - You're killing your mother.
You only get one, you know.\\
250 - Eric, this place has
a washer and dryer.\\
251 - Wait. A washer and free water?\\
252 - My God, it's like there's no
reason to ever come home.\\
253 - You know?\\
254 - Excuse me.\\
255 - Washer and dryer, Red. They are
going to have a washer and dryer!\\
256 - That redheaded harlot is gonna be
Shout-ing out my baby's grass stains!\\
257 - What about my last summer
with my youngest child?\\
258 - I bet you weren't thinking
about that when you went fishing.\\
259 - I bought sparklers for the
Fourth of July. He loves sparklers,\\
260 - and now he's leaving, and what are
we gonna do for the Fourth of July?\\
261 - There's a car show in Kenosha.\\
262 - A car show?\\
263 - I don't want to go to a
car show in Kenosha.\\
264 - I want three more
months with my baby boy,\\
265 - and now they're gone
because of your bull!\\
266 - Way to go, dumb ass!\\
267 - Ah, it feels good to be back!\\
268 - Just Kelso and Hyde.
No chick can come between us!\\
269 - All right. So what do you wanna
do? We can play air hockey,\\
270 - give Fez a wedgie...\\
271 - Oh, my brother just got a new
stereo, we can throw it off an overpass.\\
272 - Actually, I changed my mind.
I'm gonna get Jackie back.\\
273 - What? No way. What
about our third-grade pact?\\
274 - We also made a pact to invent
a formula for invisibility.\\
275 - - That fell through, too.
- Well... Because you gave up!\\
276 - Look, Kelso, I never felt this
way about a girl before, okay?\\
277 - And that pretty much beats our third-grade
pact. I'm sorry, but I wanna be with her.\\
278 - Well, at the hospital, you
said that I could have her.\\
279 - That was when I didn't think
I still had a shot with her!\\
280 - Well, you know, for your
information, I still have a shot with her.\\
281 - She accepted my jellybeans.\\
282 - I don't know what that means,
but you can't have her.\\
283 - You closed the door.\\
284 - Yeah? Well, now
I'm closing the door on you,\\
285 - and once again,
I'm swallowing the key!\\
286 - And you're locked inside,
and I'm getting Jackie back!\\
287 - Well, you're gonna lose.
Heh-heh!\\
288 - Yeah? Well, if by "lose" you
mean "win," then you're right,\\
289 - I am gonna lose.\\
290 - Well, thanks a lot for getting
me at the police station,\\
291 - you two sons of two bitches!\\
292 - Fez, what happened?\\
293 - Well, I got arrested. And
they did a background check\\
294 - and found out that my student visa
expires when I graduate from high school.\\
295 - What?\\
296 - Yeah, now I have to leave the country
after graduation. That's in a week.\\
297 - And I have to
relearn my native language.\\
298 - - Good day.
- No, but, Fez...\\
299 - Way to go. If you hadn't fallen off the
water tower, we could've helped him out.\\
300 - They should've x-rayed
your head at the hospital.\\
301 - They did.\\
302 - And for your information,
they found nothing.\\
303 - Mmm!\\
304 - I can't believe our little Fez
is gonna be deported.\\
305 - God, I wish there was
something we could do.\\
306 - Maybe I could talk to the
mayor, he owes me one.\\
307 - Eric, we can't let this happen.\\
308 - If Fez goes back to his country
with those pictures he took,\\
309 - my panties are
gonna end up on a stamp!\\
310 - Pop-Tarts? Where's Mom?\\
311 - She went fishing.
Shut up and eat.\\
312 - "Dear President Jimmy Carter,
the following is a list of reasons\\
313 - "why I, Fez, should be allowed
to stay in your great country.\\
314 - "Number one, I have never gone
number one on your beautiful soil.\\
315 - "Number two, I have never
gone number two on your..."\\
316 - Wait, scratch that.\\
317 - "Number two, Fez is also a word
for a hat. Uncle Sam wears a hat.\\
318 - "Coincidence? Yes.\\
319 - "Three, where else am I
going to live? France?"\\
320 - France.
\subsection {Episode 25: Celebration Day}
1 - My last American Popsicle,\\
2 - washed down by my
last American grape soda.\\
3 - Fez, it's sad
you're getting deported,\\
4 - but this "last American" crap
is getting annoying.\\
5 - My last American
chance to annoy you.\\
6 - Hey, come on,
Fez, look on the bright side.\\
7 - I mean, we graduate tomorrow.\\
8 - You go to your country
with a high school diploma.\\
9 - They'll probably make you, like,
head medicine man or something.\\
10 - Eric, there is no bright side
about going back to a place\\
11 - where people are
outnumbered by lizards.\\
12 - I'm gonna miss you, man.\\
13 - When you get there,
can you mail me a lizard?\\
14 - Eric, guess what came for you.\\
15 - Okay, they just send those
to me, okay?\\
16 - I don't even find
those girls attractive.\\
17 - No, you perv. It's the key to
our new apartment in Madison.\\
18 - - Oh.
- Now we can leave tomorrow\\
19 - after graduation,
like we wanted.\\
20 - Great. By this time next week,\\
21 - our new neighbors will be
hearing your cries of love\\
22 - through our paper-thin walls.\\
23 - Cries of love?
Or cries of disappointment?\\
24 - Oh, I don't wanna go.\\
25 - Come on, Fez. It's not like
we're never gonna see you again.\\
26 - I'm sure in a couple months,
you'll be, like,\\
27 - on the cover of
National Geographic.\\
28 - Yeah, those bastards
are always so intrusive.\\
29 - Fez, look, at least
we're going camping tonight\\
30 - and we'll all be together
for our last big blow-out.\\
31 - Actually, it won't be all of us.\\
32 - Kelso can't make it on account
of he's got a broken face.\\
33 - I don't got a broken face.\\
34 - Well, you will if you keep interfering
with me getting Jackie back.\\
35 - You're the one
that's interfering.\\
36 - You know what?
I'm going and Jackie's going,\\
37 - and you're staying home!\\
38 - - No, you are.
- No, you are!\\
39 - - Fine, stay home, then.
- I will!\\
40 - Hey, stop it. Would you please put aside
your differences and go camping with me?\\
41 - We only have a few
hours left together.\\
42 - - Fine. I'll go for you.
- Good.\\
43 - Now, I am off to spend the rest of my
American money on candy and porno.\\
44 - - But, Fez...
- I said candy and porno!\\
45 - Hey, Jackie, you're gonna love
these cookies on the camping trip.\\
46 - They're sweet and tasty,
just like me.\\
47 - - Kelso, this apple's
kind of like you, too.
- You mean juicy and delicious?\\
48 - No, red and bruised.\\
49 - Yeah? Well, these hot dogs
are like you, too, Hyde,\\
50 - they're... Uh...\\
51 - - Kosher.
- Yeah, kosher!\\
52 - - Wait, what's kosher?
- That means
blessed by a rabbi.\\
53 - Burn!\\
54 - Jackie, are you sure
you wanna go camping?\\
55 - These idiots are gonna be
competing over you the whole time.\\
56 - Well, I am glad, Donna.\\
57 - They've both jerked me around so much,
I cannot wait to watch them fight over me.\\
58 - You know, if you really wanna mess
with them, you should do it with me.\\
59 - Hey, talk about humiliating.\\
60 - So, you guys are going to the
lake, huh? It is real fun up there.\\
61 - My senior year, I set the record for
most topless rides on the rope swing.\\
62 - - I wish I was going.
- Yeah, don't even
think about it, Laurie.\\
63 - There are enough scary things
in the woods already.\\
64 - Eric, I'm being deported, and
she's loose with the boobs. She goes.\\
65 - Hey, Forman. Your mom just
got back from the loony doctor.\\
66 - She got real depressed when she heard
you guys were moving to Madison, huh?\\
67 - Yeah, you're telling me. Last
night she was making sounds\\
68 - that were giving my
dad war flashbacks.\\
69 - What a beautiful day.\\
70 - I feel...
I feel like a rainbow.\\
71 - Anyone else feel like a rainbow?\\
72 - What happened to her?\\
73 - Something
touched me deep inside\\
74 - The day that Hyde lied\\
75 - So bye-bye, Mr. Steven Hyde\\
76 - I'm a hottie and you're
not-tie Jackie's gonna be mine\\
77 - She likes my brunette
Likes not your curly ass twine\\
78 - Oh, Jackie Burkhart,
you are so fine\\
79 - I wrote that just
for you, Jackie.\\
80 - He didn't write that, he just
ripped it off from American Pie.\\
81 - Nuh-uh, the American
Pie guy ripped me off.\\
82 - - You shut up, man.
- You shut up!\\
83 - Okay. I'm gonna freak everyone
out and tell my ghost story,\\
84 - so go hide in the woods and
jump out when I get to the end.\\
85 - You are
as wicked as you are gorgeous.\\
86 - You know, it really creeps me out being
up here after what happened to those kids.\\
87 - What kids?\\
88 - Well, a bunch of kids, just like
us, were camping out up here,\\
89 - and they disappeared.\\
90 - And all the police could find
were these bloody drag marks\\
91 - that led down to the lake.
It was like...\\
92 - It was like something killed
them and then pulled them in.\\
93 - Maybe it was
the Loch Ness monster.\\
94 - No. Fez, the Loch
Ness monster's in Africa.\\
95 - So, the police, like, searched
the lake with their sonar and stuff,\\
96 - and when they
played back the tapes,\\
97 - all they could hear in the
background was, like, a whisper.\\
98 - What did it say?\\
99 - "I am the Lady of the Lake.\\
100 - "I am the Lady of the Lake."\\
101 - Yeah. And you'll know when she's coming
because she screams before she kills.\\
102 - Let's see if we can hear her.\\
103 - I said, "Let's
see if we can hear her."\\
104 - Donna,
I'm stuck in a thorn bush.\\
105 - I heard her.
She's stuck in a thorn bush!\\
106 - I'm kind of cold.\\
107 - I'll reward whoever gets more firewood
by letting them feed me marshmallows.\\
108 - I'm not gonna go running around
the woods trying to impress you.\\
109 - I will.\\
110 - Damn it.\\
111 - I'm gonna go take
a walk down to the lake.\\
112 - She's going to the lake, old
boy. That means topless rope-swinging.\\
113 - Now, do you want to spend your
last hours in America eating s'mores\\
114 - or watching her glorious breasts
swinging in the chilly night air?\\
115 - I choose boobs.\\
116 - Well, this is so strange, you know?
It's, like, our last night all together.\\
117 - Yeah, it's too weird
to think about.\\
118 - Let's, like, do something
to get our minds off it.\\
119 - Well, here's the tent.\\
120 - So, I'll tell you what. I'll go inside,
strip down and just lay there...\\
121 - Let's go skinny-dipping. Meet me
down by the lake in five minutes.\\
122 - Wait, so...\\
123 - I have to walk all the way
down to the lake by myself?\\
124 - Yeah.\\
125 - That's cool.\\
126 - Here you go, Kitty.
Home, sweet home.\\
127 - I went into my closet to get a
jacket, I found Kitty standing in there.\\
128 - I like the way
the coats felt on my arms.\\
129 - Oh, yes!\\
130 - Why, there you are,
my little sex muffin.\\
131 - Little brother?\\
132 - What the hell was that?\\
133 - It's the Lady of the Lake!
She screams and then she kills!\\
134 - There's Laurie. Okay.
Time to turn on the charm.\\
135 - Hey, Laurie, are you naked, or
are you just happy to see me?\\
136 - - Oh, my God! Fez!
- Oh, my God! Donna!\\
137 - Steady, old boy.
Say something smooth.\\
138 - Nice honkers!\\
139 - - Get out of here!
- Hey,
you like the rough stuff, eh?\\
140 - It was awful. I saw Laurie,
and everything just went blank.\\
141 - And I just ran, Donna.
I just ran away.\\
142 - And then I heard
these high-pitched screams,\\
143 - and it was me.\\
144 - Yeah? Well,
I've got bigger problems.\\
145 - Fez is a good artist. He's gonna
paint me onto a nudie poster\\
146 - and sell it to every gaucho in
Argentina, or wherever the hell he's from.\\
147 - Eric, I'm gonna be
Miss Nude Argentina.\\
148 - You know,
being here under the stars,\\
149 - sitting on the grass,\\
150 - makes me really
glad I'm not poor.\\
151 - Check out that fire, baby.\\
152 - Yeah, if there's one thing I'm good at,
it's turning a small fire into a big fire.\\
153 - Man, that one
guitar-shaped log is roaring.\\
154 - Is that my guitar?\\
155 - Yep.
It's got a nice, warm sound.\\
156 - Dead!\\
157 - Hey, back off, man.
Jackie doesn't want you.\\
158 - Yeah? She still has feelings
for me, and you know it!\\
159 - Okay, okay, okay, stop it!
This isn't fun for me anymore!\\
160 - What?
What do you mean fun for you?\\
161 - I didn't say that.\\
162 - Yeah, you did. All right,
what are you trying to do?\\
163 - You're getting your kicks off of
watching us jump through hoops over you.\\
164 - Nah,
we didn't jump through hoops.\\
165 - I'm good at that,
I would have won that.\\
166 - All right, I'm done with this crap,
Jackie. You choose right now, me or him.\\
167 - Yeah, who's it gonna be?\\
168 - - Wait. What? No. I...
- What's the matter,
you don't know?\\
169 - No, I don't know!\\
170 - Wow.\\
171 - Drama.\\
172 - I know.\\
173 - For a second there, I almost forgot
about my sister's wet, naked ass. Oh, God.\\
174 - Yeah, where is Laurie?
And where's Fez?\\
175 - That was incredible, huh?\\
176 - It was okay.\\
177 - Okay's good enough for me.\\
178 - Wow. Yeah, I don't know
if it's the mountain air\\
179 - or the poison from that
thorn bush, but I slept great.\\
180 - Oh, my God, it's almost 10:30.
We're late for graduation!\\
181 - Wait, wait, guys?
Guys, where's the van?\\
182 - I think it's obvious, Jackie.
The Lady of the Lake stole it!\\
183 - - Why would a ghost need a van?
- What's she gonna do,
hitch a ride?\\
184 - Who's gonna pick up a ghost?\\
185 - And you're telling me
you can't decide between us?\\
186 - Oh, my God. Fez and Laurie.\\
187 - - They probably took
it to mess with us.
- Oh, man. I'm gonna kill them.\\
188 - Eric, if I'm right about the Lady
of the Lake, and I think I am,\\
189 - they might already be dead.\\
190 - I can't believe those morons
missed their own graduation!\\
191 - My whole life, I waited to hear the
Pinciotti name called at graduation.\\
192 - When they skipped
from Olendorff to Stevens,\\
193 - a little part of me died.\\
194 - Come on.
Let's get you a hoagie.\\
195 - Kitty.\\
196 - We've gotta have a little conversation
about those pills you're taking.\\
197 - These things? I think
they're working wonders.\\
198 - You know, I didn't cry once
when Eric got his diploma.\\
199 - I just smiled and
took his picture.\\
200 - That wasn't Eric,\\
201 - that was some skinny girl
with a Dorothy Hamill haircut.\\
202 - It's not fair, Red.\\
203 - You teach your children
how to walk, to use a fork,\\
204 - to look both ways
before crossing the street,\\
205 - and then one day you realize, all you're
doing is teaching them how to leave.\\
206 - We should never
have potty-trained him.\\
207 - Listen, Kitty. We did the
kid thing and it was great,\\
208 - but now I'm looking forward to
it just being the two of us again.\\
209 - This is our time,
let's enjoy it.\\
210 - You're right, Red.
I don't need those.\\
211 - Whenever I feel like I'm on the
verge of a nervous breakdown,\\
212 - I'll just come and talk to you.\\
213 - And I'll just give
you one of these.\\
214 - Wow. What a great day.\\
215 - Not only did we get
to miss our own graduation,\\
216 - but we got to ride home
in the back of a pig truck.\\
217 - Yeah,
when it went around a corner,\\
218 - one of those pigs almost
went to third base on me.\\
219 - You know what?
I need a shower.\\
220 - Hang on.
You're not going anywhere.\\
221 - - You haven't given
us an answer yet.
- Yeah, who's it gonna be?\\
222 - You know what? I can't
talk about love right now.\\
223 - The bottom of my jeans
have something brown on them!\\
224 - Where the hell have you been?\\
225 - I have waited 18 years
for my graduation picture.\\
226 - I want you all back
here at 5:00 sharp,\\
227 - in your caps and gowns,
ready to say "cheese."\\
228 - Is that clear?\\
229 - - Fine.
- Fine.\\
230 - Yes, Mom.\\
231 - Hey? What kind of a moron
leaves the keys in the ignition?\\
232 - When I put the keys in my pocket, it
distracts from my natural bulge. God!\\
233 - You guys, I've been thinking
about Steven and Michael all day,\\
234 - and I don't know who to pick.\\
235 - Face facts, Jackie. There's
only one good man in this town,\\
236 - and, well, he's leaving.\\
237 - Eric, this is really hard.\\
238 - I mean, okay, I know I love Steven
because he's smart, and he's deep,\\
239 - and when we have a
conversation, he makes me think,\\
240 - which used to give me a
headache but now I really like.\\
241 - - So, go with Hyde.
- Yeah, but Michael.\\
242 - Oh, Michael is so beautiful!\\
243 - And you spend a lot more time looking
at someone than you do talking to them.\\
244 - Again, go with Hyde.\\
245 - No, but,
Donna, you don't understand.\\
246 - Look, I know in a lot of ways I
need Steven, but Michael needs me.\\
247 - And it's nice to be needed.\\
248 - You know what, Jackie?
In order to help you,\\
249 - and, well, just to speed
this thing up, I, uh...\\
250 - I think you should just take everything
and toss it aside, and ask yourself,\\
251 - who do you love the most?\\
252 - You're right. You're right.
That's what I should do\\
253 - - because I'm...
- No, no. Not here. Not here.\\
254 - Yeah, that's... Yeah.\\
255 - More dishes? I thought
we already loaded these.\\
256 - You had to bring
the Millennium Falcon.\\
257 - Son, here's 10 bucks for gas.\\
258 - No way. Thanks.\\
259 - Well, I just wanna make sure
that you get out.\\
260 - I mean, that you get,
um, all the way there.\\
261 - Okay, guys, I made a decision.\\
262 - So, who's it gonna be? Tall
and hot or short and kosher?\\
263 - Would you shut
the hell up and let her talk?\\
264 - Okay, look, I had to ask
myself a really hard question.\\
265 - Who do I love most? I mean,
and the answer was so obvious.\\
266 - It was staring me in the face
the whole time.\\
267 - The person I love most is me.\\
268 - I love me most.\\
269 - You choose you?\\
270 - Look, if I could run across the
beach into my own arms, I would.\\
271 - Wait, what...
So where does that leave us?\\
272 - I'll figure that out after I
spend the summer by the pool.\\
273 - I feel this will be a lot
clearer when I'm much tanner.\\
274 - What a bunch of crap, man.\\
275 - You know, freaking girls.\\
276 - If it wasn't for the soft skin, the
legs, the eyes, the long fingernails,\\
277 - the butts and the boobs,
I wouldn't even talk to them.\\
278 - All right, all right, picture time.
Everybody get in front of the car.\\
279 - Hey, Forman, I got you a plant
for your new apartment,\\
280 - but, um, I can't give it to
you in front of your parents.\\
281 - Okay, here we go. One, two...\\
282 - - Guys,
I have something to tell you.
- Just talk while you pose.\\
283 - Kitty, be sure to get me in the background
loading the last bunch of Eric's crap.\\
284 - - Oh, man.
- Okay, here we go. Smile!\\
285 - Okay, tell them, Laurie.\\
286 - I married Fez so he could stay
in the country!\\
287 - You did what?\\
288 - Don't worry, Daddy. I don't
love him, I was just bored.\\
289 - Yeah, but we will
be sleeping together.\\
290 - You... Oh.\\
291 - Ooh.\\
292 - - Dad, are you all right?
- Uh, yeah. I'm fine.\\
293 - I'm just... My arm hurts.\\
294 - Red. Red, you're all clammy. Red,
I think you're having a heart attack.\\
295 - No, open your eyes.
He's having an arm attack.\\
296 - Michael. Michael, get a chair.
Laurie, call an ambulance.\\
297 - Okay. Hang in there, Dad.\\
298 - - Kitty?
- Yes, Red?\\
299 - If I don't make it,\\
300 - kill the foreigner.\\
301 - So, Red's gonna be okay, huh?\\
302 - Yeah, he's doing better, but they're
gonna be at the hospital for a while.\\
303 - - Hey, you got
the letter for your folks?
- Yes.\\
304 - I told them I'm married
and I'm not coming home,\\
305 - and that people have landed
on the Great White Head.\\
306 - Yeah, that'll get there.

WITH ANOTHER GIRL\\
283 - WHEN I CHOSE YOU?\\
284 - JACKIE, WHEN I SAID CHOOSE
BETWEEN ME AND KELSO,\\
285 - I MEANT CHOOSE ME,

287 - I WANT WHAT I WANT
WHEN I WANT IT.\\
288 - WHAT IS SO IMMATURE
ABOUT THAT?\\
289 - FORGET IT, JACKIE.\\
290 - MAYBE YOU'RE JUST

310 - I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU'RE TRYING\\
311 - TO MAKE ME FEEL
GUILTY FOR LEAVING,\\

WORK. I CAN'T STAY HERE.\\
313 - OKAY? I HAVE TO GO
OFF AND LIVE MY LIFE.\\
314 - I DESERVE THAT.\\
315 - MOM, I DESERVE A CHANCE!\\
316 - OKAY, OKAY. NO NEED
TO USE YOUR SQUEAKY VOICE.\\
317 - I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE TO LEAVE.\\
318 - I HAVE BIGGER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT\\
319 - THAN MAKING YOU FEEL GUILTY.\\
320 - ERIC, IF YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU NEED TO STAY,\\
321 - I MEAN, WE CAN TALK ABOUT...\\
322 - NO, NO.\\
323 - WE'RE LEAVING NEXT WEEK
AND THAT'S FINAL.\\
324 - OKAY.\\
325 - YEAH, IT'S BACON.\\
326 - AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU TELL
YOUR MOTHER.\\
327 - SHE DOESN'T SCARE ME.\\
328 - ERIC, I ALMOST FORGOT...\\
329 - j&j&j&\\
330 - HOW COULD STEVEN SAY
I'M NOT HIS TYPE?\\
331 - I'M EVERYBODY'S TYPE.
THAT'S MY THING.\\
332 - WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY\\
333 - ABOUT ME CHASING
AFTER YOU ANYMORE.\\
334 - I MEAN, MOST OF THE STUFF
YOU AND HYDE\\
335 - USED TO ARGUE ABOUT I
DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND,\\
336 - WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT YOU'VE
BECOME A COMPLICATED WOMAN,\\
337 - AND I DON'T WANT
NONE OF THAT.\\
338 - SO YOU'RE REALLY OKAY
WITH US JUST BEING FRIENDS?\\
339 - YEAH. I RELEASE YOU.\\
340 - FLY, LITTLE BIRD.\\
341 - FLY, FLY AWAY!\\
342 - THAT WAS YOU.\\
343 - MICHAEL, DO YOU THINK
I'M IMMATURE?\\

348 - AND THAT SKANK IN THE LEATHER
JACKET IS WHAT, COOL?\\
349 - WELL, I CAN BE COOL.\\
350 - PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.\\

FOR JOHN TRAVOLTA,\\
352 - AND THAT MOVIE
WAS TOTALLY REALISTIC.\\
353 - WOW!\\
354 - YOWZA!\\
355 - YUMMY.\\
356 - JACKIE?\\
357 - TELL ME ABOUT IT,
STEVE.\\

389 - NO, BUT I'M GONNA GET
STEVEN BACK,\\
390 - WHATEVER IT TAKES.\\
391 - AND I'M GONNA GET ME A PAIR
OF THOSE BLACK SATIN PANTS,\\
392 - 'CAUSE I LOOK GOOD

393 - MOM?\\
394 - FABRIC SOFTENER! I'M UP!\\
395 - MRS. FORMAN,

396 - OH, SURE. OH, GOD.
I'M LATE FOR WORK.\\
397 - YOU'RE WORKING TONIGHT?\\
398 - WELL, HONEY, NIGHTS CAN BE
OUR BUSIEST TIME.\\
399 - LOTS OF PEOPLE STROKE OUT
AFTER A BIG SALTY DINNER.\\
400 - BUT YOU WORKED ALL DAY.\\
401 - I KNOW. I GOTTA GO.\\
402 - OKAY, THERE'S FOOD IN THE...
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?\\
403 - THERE'S NO FOOD.\\
404 - THEY CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.\\
405 - THEY CANNOT DO THIS TO ME.
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.\\
406 - OF ALL THE PEOPLE

409 - I HAVE TO GO!\\
410 - I HAVE TO STAY.\\
411 - DONNA, I'M SORRY.\\
412 - SORRY? ERIC, I THINK
IT'S AMAZING\\

FOR YOUR FAMILY.\\
414 - AND, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE
EACH OTHER ON WEEKENDS.\\
415 - OH, SO YOU'RE STILL GOING?\\
416 - WELL...\\
417 - YEAH, I MEAN...\\
418 - YEAH.\\
419 - YEAH.\\
420 - NO. OF COURSE.\\
421 - OH, COME ON.\\
422 - I THINK I KNOW SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.\\
423 - HEY, UM...\\
424 - CAN WE JUST LIKE...\\
425 - COULD WE JUST SIT
FOR A WHILE?\\
426 - YEAH, SURE.\\
427 - SIT FOR A WHILE?\\
428 - IF I HADN'T FOUND THIS BACON,
I'D BE REALLY PISSED OFF.\\
429 - j&j&j&\\
430 - I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T WEAR DRESSES\\
431 - AND I KNOW
HOW TO FIX A CAR,\\
432 - IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LIKE
TO BE TOLD I'M PRETTY.\\
433 - WOW. IT'S LIKE
I'M READING MY OWN JOURNAL.\\
434 - I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY.\\
435 - I THINK
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.\\
436 - I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY.\\
437 - STOP.\\
438 - IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?\\
439 - SHH! YOU'LL BREAK
THE SPELL.
\subsection {Episode 02: Join Together}
1 - All right,
Donna, put your chair here.\\
2 - I wanna get Steven's attention,\\
3 - and with you next to me I'll
look like a tiny porcelain doll.\\
4 - You know, Jackie, some people
actually find me to be of normal height.\\
5 - Sure,
if they're green and jolly.\\
6 - I can't take it.
Watching Donna lie out,\\
7 - knowing she's gonna go to
college and I have to stay here.\\
8 - She's so, so...\\
9 - - Juicy.
- Juicy.\\
10 - My juicy.\\
11 - Well, I'm not gonna stay here locked
in the house just 'cause Jackie looks\\
12 - ridiculously hot in
that bathing suit.\\
13 - - Later, Forman.
- Bye-bye, juicy.\\
14 - Ladies. Ladies' bodies.\\
15 - You know, I wish someone
would rub lotion on my shoulders.\\
16 - Think they're
getting a little red.\\
17 - Yeah, you should be careful.\\
18 - Looks like you're
starting to scab.\\
19 - Oh, that's a burn about a burn.\\
20 - That's a second-degree burn!\\
21 - You know, Jackie,
I think maybe Hyde's moved on.\\
22 - No. No, no, no, no.\\
23 - You don't just move on
from Jackie Burkhart.\\
24 - I'm like the bottle. You need a
12-step program to break my spell.\\
25 - Okay, ladies. All these sound
waves are interfering with my sunrays.\\
26 - Let's tan.\\
27 - All right, I'm gonna need you
to lotion me up, darling,\\
28 - but only rub where you
can see. No roaming.\\
29 - Hanging out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - We're all all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - Hey, Mom, Dad, I have
something I wanna tell you.\\
39 - - I've decided
not to move away.
- What?\\
40 - Yeah, I'm gonna stay and put
off college for just a little while,\\
41 - or at least until you're well
enough to go back to work.\\
42 - My baby, my baby, my baby!\\
43 - Okay, Mom, this is actually
kind of embarrassing.\\
44 - You're actually
really hurting me, yeah.\\
45 - You mean I've been waiting 18 years
for you to get your butt out of this house,\\
46 - and now you're staying?\\
47 - Look, Mom, I signed
over my paycheck to you.\\
48 - I want you to go
buy yourself something pretty.\\
49 - Or, I don't know,\\
50 - electricity.\\
51 - Oh, honey, thank you.\\
52 - Red, it wouldn't
kill you to thank him.\\
53 - It might.
I just had a heart attack.\\
54 - Speaking of which, I just
found this in the garbage.\\
55 - Why would you throw away
the list of all the food\\
56 - the doctor said
we couldn't have in the house?\\
57 - Kitty,
did you look at that list?\\
58 - If I had known what I was coming
home to after my heart attack,\\
59 - I would've walked
straight into that bright light\\
60 - and never looked back.\\
61 - Oh, come on.\\
62 - It can't be that bad.\\
63 - I'll do it with you.\\
64 - 'Cause what's good for the
goose is good for the gander.\\
65 - Actually, Mom, Dad's the gander.\\
66 - The male goose.\\
67 - So it would be "what's good for
the gander is good for the goose."\\
68 - So,\\
69 - let's take a gander at what
you're giving up with the gander.\\
70 - That's how you do that.\\
71 - Okay. "Potato chips,
other salty snacks."\\
72 - Good advice. That doctor obviously
knows what he's talking about.\\
73 - - "Butter,
heavy cream, cheese."
- Gone, makes a lot of sense.\\
74 - - "Alcoholic beverages."
- Okay, that doctor's a quack.\\
75 - God, it's gonna be so hard
going off to college without you.\\
76 - But we'll see each other
on the weekends, right?\\
77 - Well, you say that now,
but then there's that weekend\\
78 - where you call home
and say you have to study,\\
79 - but I hear Moose, the
place-kicker, in the background,\\
80 - asking if you want
another shot of tequila, so...\\
81 - Eric, that would never happen.\\
82 - I would never date a place-kicker.
It's quarterback or nothing for me.\\
83 - You know, the more I think
about leaving you, the sadder I get.\\
84 - And the sadder I get,
the more I wanna be with you.\\
85 - Right now.\\
86 - Now? Well...\\
87 - Yeah, I mean...\\
88 - All right, this is great,\\
89 - it'll be, like, completely
spontaneous, like I just...\\
90 - - Why are you talking?
- I'm sorry, I just... Okay.\\
91 - So it turns out\\
92 - that going-away sex is
even hotter than make-up sex.\\
93 - It's like these chips. They
say, "Now even crunchier,"\\
94 - and you're thinking,
"Oh, man, there is no way."\\
95 - But then you take a bite\\
96 - and it is crunchier.\\
97 - Dude, if something's crunchy, you
should really have that looked at.\\
98 - There's no time, my friend,\\
99 - I have a distraught
neighbor girl to attend to.\\
100 - Dry your eyes, baby,
the loving's on its way!\\
101 - Toe ring.\\
102 - Oh, Fez, you like?\\
103 - Yeah, got a toe ring.\\
104 - On the little piggy
that went to the market.\\
105 - Steven, what do you think?\\
106 - Can't resist toe ring.\\
107 - Whatever.\\
108 - Well, you know,
I have all sorts of things now\\
109 - that I didn't have
when we were going out.\\
110 - Toe ring, tan lines, a tattoo.\\
111 - You don't have a tattoo,
you're bluffing.\\
112 - Do you have a tattoo?\\
113 - Well, we're not going out,
so I guess you'll never know.\\
114 - Ugh,
this bra is so uncomfortable.\\
115 - You know, I think I'm gonna stop
wearing them altogether. See you.\\
116 - Look at you watch her.
You love her, man.\\
117 - "Oh,
baby, I love you so much."\\
118 - - Were you doing Jackie?
- Yes, yes.\\
119 - Why am I even
thinking about her?\\
120 - Man, she's like Tahiti.\\
121 - It's warm and it's beautiful
and you wanna go there,\\
122 - but when you do,
you get bit by a mosquito\\
123 - and you get malaria and
you're sick for the rest of your life.\\
124 - Well, she's obviously
not over you, either.\\
125 - I mean, she's practically putting
on a show to get your attention.\\
126 - Just imagine it.\\
127 - I love to dance.\\
128 - Okay. The doctor wins.\\
129 - Eric and I boxed
up all the liquor.\\
130 - Man, look at all this. It's
like Dean Martin exploded.\\
131 - There were bottles in the liquor
cabinet, the dining room hutch,\\
132 - my mom's nightstand.\\
133 - Oh, no, no. That's
for polishing furniture.\\
134 - Mom, there's lipstick on it.\\
135 - Just your luck, Forman.
You're about to turn 18\\
136 - and there's gonna be no hooch
left in the house to steal.\\
137 - I mean avoid.\\
138 - Do homework next to.\\
139 - Pray near.\\
140 - Come on!\\
141 - Yeah, it's gonna be
pretty boring around here.\\
142 - You know what you should do?
Go to college.\\
143 - Mom, would it be too much to ask\\
144 - for Dad to be
grateful that I'm staying?\\
145 - Honey, we're all
going through hard times.\\
146 - You're giving up your future,
I'm giving up my schnapps.\\
147 - Let's not compare our pain.\\
148 - Hey, sorry I'm late.\\
149 - Donna was really
upset about leaving,\\
150 - so I had to comfort
her in a bedular way.\\
151 - It turns out if I get her sad,\\
152 - she gives it away like
goldfish at a freaking carnival.\\
153 - Eric, I think you may have found
a secret "open sesame" to sex.\\
154 - Make the lady cry.\\
155 - Perhaps I should
try that with my wife.\\
156 - "Laurie, here's a dead cat.
Now do me."\\
157 - A little history, Fez.\\
158 - I think Laurie has a lot of "open
sesames," like, "Hi, Laurie."\\
159 - That usually does it.\\
160 - Actually, I only
ever got as far as "Hi."\\
161 - Fez, I did it with your wife!\\
162 - Yeah, I have so much power
over Donna now, it's like...\\
163 - I know how Obi-Wan Kenobi feels.\\
164 - "These
aren't the droids you're looking for."\\
165 - Man, I wish I could do it with
Donna in a landspeeder on Tatooine.\\
166 - That would be so awesome.\\
167 - Hey, Steven,\\
168 - check out my new
super-sexy tattoo.\\
169 - Hard to keep
your hands off, huh?\\
170 - Steven!\\
171 - Sorry.
Here's your tattoo back.\\
172 - I'll take that.\\
173 - Steven, why are you
being so difficult?\\
174 - Jackie, no amount of
tattoos or toe rings\\
175 - are gonna fix the fact that
you have a lot to apologize for.\\
176 - You're the one who
should apologize.\\
177 - Well, then I guess we're
not getting back together.\\
178 - I guess we're not.\\
179 - Oh, and by the way, you
don't deserve a real tattoo.\\
180 - But if I were to get one,\\
181 - I'd show it to Fez before
I'd ever show it to you.\\
182 - I hope she gets
it on her heinie.\\
183 - But, Jackie, it really bugs me that
you and Hyde aren't back together.\\
184 - So, as the man who used
to pleasure you endlessly,\\
185 - I feel it is my obligation
to step in and fix this.\\
186 - 'Cause when I'm a cop,\\
187 - I'm gonna have to deal with
domestic cases like this all the time.\\
188 - And the good news
is he'll have guns.\\
189 - Yeah, this is gonna
be a piece of cake.\\
190 - You know, they should have
put me in charge of Vietnam.\\
191 - I would have had those people
making out in a week.\\
192 - Wow. Donna,
that might be the last time\\
193 - that you'll ever get to see Kelso
make an even bigger mess of a problem.\\
194 - Yeah. I'm gonna miss that.\\
195 - And I'm gonna miss you.\\
196 - Well, I'm not gonna miss you
two slobbering all over each other\\
197 - like fat girls in
a house with free meat.\\
198 - And that might be the last time
that Jackie ever makes fun of us,\\
199 - fat girls and meat.\\
200 - Yeah.\\
201 - - What?
- Nothing, I just...\\
202 - This could be the last time\\
203 - that you and I stand
by the Vista Cruiser.\\
204 - I just waxed her.
She's all slippy-slidey.\\
205 - Donna, this might be the last
time that I bring you your toothbrush.\\
206 - That's not my toothbrush.\\
207 - Might be the last time that\\
208 - I bring you
the wrong toothbrush.\\
209 - Hello, darling.\\
210 - I see you are washing
your unmentionables.\\
211 - Yeah, do you know what gets
out grass stains and Kahlua?\\
212 - Anyways, I was thinking
how sad you must be,\\
213 - considering the mess
you made of your life.\\
214 - With all that sadness,\\
215 - do you also not get needy?\\
216 - You know, I sort of do.\\
217 - Ali Baba, the treasure is mine!\\
218 - I'm gonna go see
if Carlos is home.\\
219 - That Carlos is one lucky SOB
to have a wife like mine.\\
220 - Look, Hyde, I know you don't
wanna tell Jackie that you're sorry,\\
221 - but come on, there's gotta be
some things that you did\\
222 - that you wish you hadn't done.\\
223 - Like that time that you
told me to eat that stuff,\\
224 - and I didn't know what it was.\\
225 - And then you licked your lips
and you rubbed your stomach\\
226 - and you were like, "Mmm,
it's really good, Kelso."\\
227 - And then I ate it and then I
wished I hadn't have done that.\\
228 - Yeah, well...\\
229 - Maybe with Jackie I was\\
230 - sort of impetuous and
maybe a little rash.\\
231 - Now, see, that's something
that Jackie ought to know.\\
232 - Hyde says that he was sort
of infectious and he has a rash.\\
233 - - What?
- I'm just telling
you what he said.\\
234 - All right, look, Michael,\\
235 - Steven's the one who
messed up the relationship.\\
236 - He thought you and I were
together, but he was just wrong.\\
237 - He fabricated the whole mess.\\
238 - Well, somebody ought
to make that clear.\\
239 - Jackie wants you to know
that there was a mess\\
240 - 'cause she was
wearing the wrong fabric.\\
241 - - That can't be what she said.
- It's word for word, man.\\
242 - - Kelso,
would you get out of here?
- What? I'm helping.\\
243 - You're making me
wanna kick your ass!\\
244 - That better be the rash talking.\\
245 - Busted, mister.\\
246 - You're like a damn cat.\\
247 - I'm gonna make you wear a bell.\\
248 - Bad health in a can,
that's what that is.\\
249 - The doctor said he wants nothing
like that around here, and I agree.\\
250 - All it takes is just, it's a
little bit of will power, Red.\\
251 - Even though you used to
do something without thinking,\\
252 - you just have to
grab a hold of those thoughts.\\
253 - Can I get you a refill there?\\
254 - Well...\\
255 - There's a lesson for you.\\
256 - You're welcome.\\
257 - - Hey.
- Hey, listen, son.\\
258 - You know, it means
a lot to your mother,\\
259 - you staying here
and helping out the family.\\
260 - And, as for me, I...\\
261 - Well...\\
262 - There.\\
263 - Doctor said I should
write down my feelings.\\
264 - Are you actually thanking me?\\
265 - This is a list of yard work.\\
266 - Yeah, the lawn thanks you for
all that mowing you're gonna do.\\
267 - - You're welcome, Dad.
- Yeah, well...\\
268 - All right, we're both men here.\\
269 - - Oh, God.
- What's wrong?\\
270 - Nothing. It's just,
this could be the last time\\
271 - that you and I watch Gilligan
get hit on the head by the Skipper.\\
272 - Eric, the more we talk
about me going away,\\
273 - the sadder you get.\\
274 - And being with you so much lately
has been great, but afterwards...\\
275 - Well, you always used to look
a little bit ashamed.\\
276 - And, I mean,
now you just seem depressed.\\
277 - No, no, no.\\
278 - I'm not depressed, Donna,
you are depressed.\\
279 - - Okay, let's do this.
- Okay, hold on.\\
280 - All this "last time" stuff,\\
281 - have you been
saying that just for sex?\\
282 - What? Have I... What?\\
283 - "This is not the one you're angry with."\\
284 - You're disgusting.\\
285 - Eric, that might be the last
time we fight over you trying\\
286 - - to get me to
have sex with you!
- I know!\\
287 - You know, Fez, this whole thing
with Hyde and Jackie is stupid.\\
288 - I mean, they both wanna be
together, and they would in a second\\
289 - if they just thought the other
one had said, "I'm sorry."\\
290 - Eureka, Fez, eureka!\\
291 - I'm one step ahead
of you, my friend.\\
292 - Yeah. I'll just
lie to both of them,\\
293 - and tell them the other
one said, "I'm sorry."\\
294 - I thought we were
going to pan for gold.\\
295 - Okay.\\
296 - Okay, here we go, let's make up.\\
297 - All right. Look, Steven,
I heard what you said.\\
298 - Yeah, I heard what... Wait a
minute, you heard what I said?\\
299 - Yeah. Michael told me.\\
300 - And, just so you know,
I'm sorry, too.\\
301 - Too?\\
302 - No, you're not sorry, too.
You're sorry one, I'm sorry two.\\
303 - - Wait, what? No... Michael said that...
- Yeah, he said that...\\
304 - Whoa!\\
305 - I did my work. You two gotta
clean this mess up yourselves.\\
306 - So nothing's changed, then?\\
307 - - Guess not.
- Forget this.\\
308 - - Fine.
- Okay. Enough.\\
309 - Look, you guys, who
cares who apologized first?\\
310 - Look, Jackie obviously
wants to be with you,\\
311 - and you're here, which means
that you wanna be with her,\\
312 - and I don't blame you,
'cause with that rash,\\
313 - you ain't got
a whole lot of choices.\\
314 - All right, look, Steven,
do you wanna be with me?\\
315 - No. No,
a shrug's not gonna cut it.\\
316 - Steven,
I need you to say something.\\
317 - All right.
Look, I'll even go first.\\
318 - Steven, I wanna be with you.\\
319 - And you...\\
320 - I...\\
321 - Can you hang on a second?\\
322 - Would you get out of here?\\
323 - If you want me to leave, all
you have to do is say, "Please."\\
324 - Fine. Please.\\
325 - That's better.\\
326 - Jackie, I do wanna be with you.\\
327 - - Because you love...
- Don't push it.\\
328 - Okay.\\
329 - Okay, Steven.
Where's your beer?\\
330 - What? Me, beer?\\
331 - Kitty threw away all my beer.
The Packers are down by 11.\\
332 - You're 18, I know you have
beer. So where's your beer?\\
333 - I don't want used beer.\\
334 - Well, I might have a couple
fresh ones in the shower.\\
335 - Yeah. I'm running low, I
should probably hit the store.
\subsection {Episode 03: Magic Bus}
1 - And midnight.\\
2 - So long, 17. In the words of
Alice Cooper, I'm 18 and I like it.\\
3 - - Happy birthday, man.
- Let's give him his present.\\
4 - A case of 23 beers.\\
5 - - Kelso?
- I deserved one, I carried it.\\
6 - Yeah, that tastes like 18.\\
7 - Whoa, check out the new stereo.\\
8 - Oh, it plays records and eight-tracks? This
thing's, like, right out of the future.\\
9 - Yeah, Donna gave it to me.\\
10 - I think she feels bad that she's
going to college without me.\\
11 - So, on the one hand I'm losing\\
12 - the girl that I've been in
love with since I was five,\\
13 - but on the other hand,
I get a crappy stereo.\\
14 - Score!\\
15 - What? I mean, she's going
to dump you eventually.\\
16 - Rock-and-roll never dies.\\
17 - Kelso,
Donna and I are fine, okay?\\
18 - I mean, she's waiting until the very
last bus to go to school tomorrow\\
19 - so we can spend every minute
of my birthday together.\\
20 - We're just gonna make this work.\\
21 - Eric, long-distance
relationships don't work.\\
22 - Just ask my
girlfriend back home.\\
23 - Fez, you have
a girlfriend back home?\\
24 - No, don't you listen? Long-distance
relationships don't work.\\
25 - You guys, Donna and I are not gonna let
a couple of miles come between us, okay?\\
26 - This isn't the end of the world.\\
27 - My world is over, man.\\
28 - Forman, I know what you're
thinking. Donna's gonna go to school,\\
29 - meet a whole bunch of people
way cooler than you,\\
30 - and probably fall in love
with someone else.\\
31 - - And you don't think she will?
- Oh, I know she will.\\
32 - My advice to you is drink up.\\
33 - I can't believe she's
just leaving, you know?\\
34 - Hasn't she heard of a little
something called sacrifice?\\
35 - You know, she sacrifices an education,
or a career, or a future of any kind,\\
36 - and in exchange she gets me.\\
37 - I'd make that trade,
you're a dependable guy.\\
38 - You don't offer much
in the way of excitement,\\
39 - but if it's the same old same
old the girl's after, look out.\\
40 - I never deserved her, anyway.\\
41 - Well, we're here for you.
Here you go, dry your eyes.\\
42 - Thanks, you guys, I feel better.\\
43 - I think we all do.\\
44 - All right, buddy, come on.
Let's get you to bed.\\
45 - Big boy,
we're gonna tuck you in.\\
46 - All right, sleep tight, buddy.\\
47 - - Oh, good Lord.
- What, what?\\
48 - Happy birthday, dumb ass.\\
49 - Hanging out\\
50 - Down the street\\
51 - The same old thing\\
52 - We did last week\\
53 - Not a thing to do\\
54 - But talk to you\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
58 - Okay, Red, remember,
don't tire yourself out today,\\
59 - because tonight is a
special night in the bedroom.\\
60 - Bob Newhart's on Carson?\\
61 - No, silly. It's been a month
since your heart attack.\\
62 - Tonight's the night
the doctor gave us the "okay."\\
63 - You know, the "okay."\\
64 - Kitty, I don't like clues,
just say it.\\
65 - - The okay to make love.
- Don't say that.\\
66 - Well, tonight is my
only night off this week.\\
67 - Let's not talk about
it in front of the boy.\\
68 - Or girl,
or whatever he is today.\\
69 - Let's not talk about what
in front of the boy?\\
70 - You guys are planning a surprise
party for me tonight, aren't you?\\
71 - Well, first of all, thank you.\\
72 - Second of all, let me just say, 18 years
old, not too old for ice-cream cake, okay.\\
73 - So, where's my
special birthday breakfast?\\
74 - Oh, my goodness,
I've been so busy this morning\\
75 - I forgot all
about your breakfast.\\
76 - Okay, I'll play along.\\
77 - Lah-dee-dah,
here I am, completely unaware\\
78 - that I'm about to get
my super birthday breakfast\\
79 - with four pieces of bacon.\\
80 - Honey, there is no breakfast.\\
81 - Mom, gag's over.
Give me the bacon.\\
82 - Are you sure you want bacon?
It's fattening.\\
83 - You barely fit into
your best dress as it is.\\
84 - Eric, honey,
let me make it up to you.\\
85 - How about tonight, instead of
hanging out around here, you just...\\
86 - You take the night off.\\
87 - Oh,
because there's "no party."\\
88 - I'm with you.\\
89 - Steven, I am so glad
we're back together.\\
90 - I thought I'd lost
my little Pudding Pop forever.\\
91 - Wanna hear something sick?\\
92 - I actually missed you
calling me Pudding Pop.\\
93 - How many times have I told you
guys not to make out on my bed?\\
94 - You guys are like cats,
you don't even listen. Down!\\
95 - Donna! Donna, you know what?\\
96 - You're leaving tonight, so
technically this isn't your bed anymore.\\
97 - And besides, I just can't keep
my hands off my Pudding Pop.\\
98 - - Pudding Pop?
- Pudding Pop?\\
99 - Is that supposed to be me?\\
100 - I've never heard that
name before in my life.\\
101 - Donna, you're amazing.\\
102 - Taking the midnight bus tonight\\
103 - just so you can spend my
whole birthday with me, that...\\
104 - I swear, that is right up there
with not wearing a bra in public.\\
105 - Boy, you're taking
this really well.\\
106 - Yeah, well, I know I have a
history of ruining these things.\\
107 - Birthdays, holidays,\\
108 - that perm that made you
look like a poodle.\\
109 - But I'm not gonna do that, okay?\\
110 - I'm not gonna ruin
our last day together.\\
111 - Oh,
so you're taking the toaster.\\
112 - What?\\
113 - It's just, you know,
we bought it together,\\
114 - so I guess I kind of thought
it was, like, our toaster.\\
115 - What do I know? It's not like
I'm the one going to college, right?\\
116 - You are, with my toaster.\\
117 - - Okay,
Eric, if it's a problem...
- Oh, it's a problem.\\
118 - You thought you could
just sneak it out of town\\
119 - without telling me 'cause you
knew it was wrong, didn't you, lady?\\
120 - Okay, Eric, I don't know what your deal is,
but you're ruining our last day together.\\
121 - I wouldn't be me
if I didn't ruin it!\\
122 - You know what? Enjoy
your toast, I hope it burns!\\
123 - Oh, man, Casablanca.\\
124 - This is the part where Humphrey
Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman\\
125 - they'll always have Paris.\\
126 - What's his problem?
The guy owns a bar, man.\\
127 - I'd be beating those
French sluts off with a stick.\\
128 - - How'd it go with Donna?
- I ruined it.\\
129 - And I knew I was ruining it
while I was ruining it.\\
130 - I just kept on ruining it.\\
131 - Now, Bogey. You know, that...\\
132 - That guy knows how to let a
woman go. "Here's looking at you, kid."\\
133 - I threw a toaster.\\
134 - Hey, if you wanna be like
Bogey, you gotta let her go.\\
135 - Only Bogey'll get
another hot girl.\\
136 - You, I see Star Wars
conventions and fat chicks.\\
137 - Hey, Bogey and I have
more in common than you think.\\
138 - Of all the teenage burger hangouts
in all the towns in all the world,\\
139 - she walks into mine, only
to walk right back out again.\\
140 - Play it, Fez.\\
141 - Well,
it'll cost you a Baby Ruth.\\
142 - Hold the line\\
143 - Love isn't always on time\\
144 - Oh, no, no\\
145 - Hold the line\\
146 - Love isn't always on time\\
147 - Love isn't always on time\\
148 - Hold the line\\
149 - Love isn't always on time\\
150 - Now I want a Baby Ruth.\\
151 - Hey, let's go to The Hub.\\
152 - - I can't.
- Let me see that.\\
153 - Forman, I think there's a rule
that when you turn 18\\
154 - you can't let Scooby
tell you the time anymore.\\
155 - Shows what you know, Hyde.\\
156 - That's Deputy Dawg.\\
157 - I can't wait until all of Donna's
giant clothes are out of the closet.\\
158 - I don't even go in there now.\\
159 - I'm afraid I'll fall into one of her
shoes and never be heard from again.\\
160 - Well, I guess I must
be Eric's best friend,\\
161 - because I'm the only one went to the
trouble of getting him a birthday cake.\\
162 - It's good, too.\\
163 - Maybe we should think about
getting him something else.\\
164 - What do you think, Pudding Pop?\\
165 - Why does everybody
keep calling me that?\\
166 - My name's not Pudding Pop, never
heard that name before in my life.\\
167 - Forman's dead.\\
168 - Hey, if you guys think that's funny,
you should hear what Steven calls me.\\
169 - He calls me his...\\
170 - Hey!\\
171 - Oh, hey, that's some good cake.\\
172 - So,
I heard Eric threw a toaster.\\
173 - It's almost as bad as the time
he called you a poodle head.\\
174 - Which he brought up again today.\\
175 - He's not good.\\
176 - Well, I'm just surprised
Eric was able to lift a toaster.\\
177 - Hey. Donna, I've been
looking all over for you.\\
178 - I'm so sorry I was
such a jerk earlier.\\
179 - It's your last day, and
it's my birthday, I just...\\
180 - I wanna spend it together.\\
181 - Eric, it's okay, I know you
don't care about the toaster.\\
182 - You're sad I'm
leaving and I'm sad, too.\\
183 - Hey, don't take him back.
He threw a toaster!\\
184 - Hey, shouldn't my surprise
party have started already?\\
185 - We keep telling you there's no
party, man. It's like you're deaf.\\
186 - Eric, there is no party.\\
187 - No, no, no! Why are you here?
You can't be here!\\
188 - Oh, right, I'll go outside,
then I'll come back,\\
189 - and you guys yell, "Surprise!"
and I'll yell, "You got me!"\\
190 - Eric, honey, there's no party.\\
191 - What?
How can there not be a party?\\
192 - Mom, what is more important
than your only son's 18th birthday?\\
193 - Okay, fine.\\
194 - For the first time since his heart attack,
your father and I are having intercourse.\\
195 - Sexy.\\
196 - Okay, let's get this over with.\\
197 - Happy birthday.\\
198 - I can't fricking believe that my
mom didn't plan a fricking party\\
199 - on my 18th fricking birthday.\\
200 - The only party going on in this house
is in their bedroom and that's all...\\
201 - Forman, you hate it when your
mom does stuff for your birthday.\\
202 - Remember two years ago?\\
203 - I'm 16.\\
204 - Hey, your mother worked
very hard on this party.\\
205 - Now, you be nice to her or
we're canceling the puppet show.\\
206 - Oh, oh, sit on the tiny horse,
so I can take a picture.\\
207 - I can't, Mom.\\
208 - I'll kill it.\\
209 - Yeah, okay, fine, but she should
have done something for me.\\
210 - Well, we're here for you. We
scraped together a few bucks\\
211 - and got you something
you can actually use.\\
212 - - What is it?
- It's a knob for
your new stereo.\\
213 - Wait, did you guys just take
this off while I wasn't looking?\\
214 - Eric, there's an old saying.
"Don't look a gift horse in the knob."\\
215 - And what happened to my
Led Zeppelin eight-track?\\
216 - You mean gift number two.\\
217 - Well, hello, handsome.\\
218 - Boy, am I tired.
I think I'll just go to bed.\\
219 - Red Forman,
what has gotten into you?\\
220 - I just think that there are
more appropriate ways\\
221 - for us to spend our time.\\
222 - Like you knit and I'll whittle.\\
223 - That's a nice life.\\
224 - Red, I know what this is about.\\
225 - You're afraid of getting physical
so soon after your heart attack.\\
226 - Kitty,
you know I love what we do\\
227 - but am I willing to die for it?\\
228 - Now, you just relax. Nurse
Kitty is here to take care of you.\\
229 - Well, the big paw's on the 11,\\
230 - so it's almost time to take
Donna to the bus station.\\
231 - I mean, this is it, you guys.
She's really going away.\\
232 - Forman, we have just the thing
to make you feel better.\\
233 - Another case of beer!\\
234 - Oh, I'm just not really in
the mood to put on a dress.\\
235 - But thanks anyway, Pudding Pop.\\
236 - Look, man, if you want her to
stay, can't you just ask her to stay?\\
237 - Man, you have no idea
how badly I wanna do that,\\
238 - but I just... I don't
think it'd be fair to her.\\
239 - Fair to her?\\
240 - Who cares what the woman
thinks? This is America.\\
241 - You know what?\\
242 - I already screwed this up once today,
I am not gonna screw this up again.\\
243 - I'm gonna fight every bad instinct I
have, and I'm just gonna let her go.\\
244 - Like Bogey did in Casablanca.\\
245 - Wait, so that's it? No one's gonna
drink beer and put on a dress?\\
246 - - Hey, Fez, you want a beer?
- Sure.\\
247 - Jackie!\\
248 - - What did you do to my room?
- Your room? Read the wall, Donna.\\
249 - Jackie, this is still my room
until I leave, so will you get out\\
250 - and give me and Eric
a few minutes alone?\\
251 - But I still have to paint
the heart over the "I".\\
252 - - Out, go. Out, shoo.
- Oh, God! All right, Donna!\\
253 - Okay, you're all packed.\\
254 - I can't believe
my baby's leaving.\\
255 - Well, hey,
I'll still be around, sir.\\
256 - Why would I wanna pal around
with you? All you did was dirty her up.\\
257 - You should probably get going.\\
258 - Happy birthday, Eric.\\
259 - Donna, this is the nicest thing
anyone's done for me all day.\\
260 - Make a wish.\\
261 - Oh, boy, do I smell cupcakes?\\
262 - So...\\
263 - I'm really gonna miss you.\\
264 - Yeah, me, too.\\
265 - Look, Donna,
I'm really happy for you.\\
266 - Well, bye, I guess.\\
267 - Donna, wait!\\
268 - - Donna, you have to stay.
- Stay? You're
supposed to tell me to go.\\
269 - No, if you leave
you'll regret it.\\
270 - Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but in a couple of weeks or...\\
271 - You know, at least by Christmas.\\
272 - Oh, my God, you're such a loser.\\
273 - - Donna.
- Here's looking at you, dork.\\
274 - What did you wanna tell me?\\
275 - Have a safe trip.\\
276 - Thanks.\\
277 - Donna, what...\\
278 - I couldn't do it.
I couldn't do it.\\
279 - This whole time I was thinking
I was supposed to leave,\\
280 - and then when the time came
to get on the bus, I couldn't do it.\\
281 - I'll figure college out later, all I
know is I wanna stay here with you.\\
282 - Oh, my God. Donna,\\
283 - that's what I wished for.\\
284 - Donna, we didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.\\
285 - You guys get him drunk
and make him wear a dress?\\
286 - Yes, but I've been wanting
to do this for some time.\\
287 - Too tired.\\
288 - Yeah, it was pretty silly.\\
289 - Knit and whittle.\\
290 - Yeah, I hate to whittle.\\
291 - Where's the aspirin?\\
292 - Oh, like you've never woken up
in a dress before.
\subsection {Episode 04: The Acid Queen}
1 - Guys, guess what I just heard
in the ladies' bathroom?\\
2 - Fez, what were you doing
in the ladies' bathroom?\\
3 - Oh, spying,
eating lunch, you know.\\
4 - I heard two girls say they did
not want to go to college as virgins.\\
5 - Yeah,
I caught that wave last year.\\
6 - So I'm thinking, if horny
virgins are dying for sex,\\
7 - then a-hunting
horny virgins I will go.\\
8 - By the way, Fez,
it's not pronounced virgin,\\
9 - it's pronounced vir-gin.\\
10 - I thought it was virgin?\\
11 - No, no.
Hyde's right. It's vir-gin.\\
12 - Oh, now I will not sound stupid
in front of the beautiful vir-gins.\\
13 - Oh, my God!\\
14 - That's... That's the girl.\\
15 - That's the one I made it with
at the Molly Hatchet concert.\\
16 - That's Brooke.\\
17 - Man, no one sleeps
with that Brooke.\\
18 - When we were sophomores
and she was a senior,\\
19 - she turned down her science
teacher, and he drove a Corvette.\\
20 - Yeah, she was like some kind of
mythical creature, like a unicorn.\\
21 - It's weird, it seems like
she's moving too fast.\\
22 - It's probably cause all my memories
of her are in super jiggle sexy slo-mo.\\
23 - Well, all I know is, that's her,\\
24 - and I did it with her,
and I'll prove it.\\
25 - Hey, Brooke.\\
26 - Yeah, I know this
is kind of awkward,\\
27 - but could you tell
my friends over there\\
28 - about you and me
at the Molly Hatchet concert?\\
29 - Do I know you?\\
30 - Hey,
I'm sorry to interrupt but...\\
31 - Burn!\\
32 - It's me,
Michael, from the concert.\\
33 - I've been looking
for you for weeks,\\
34 - and I think you were so blissed
out, and that does happen,\\
35 - that you gave me
the wrong phone number.\\
36 - But the good news is,
I wasn't a dream.\\
37 - I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.\\
38 - No, Michael Kelso.\\
39 - "Let's do it in the men's
room, it's more romantic."\\
40 - No, wait...\\
41 - I kicked that kid
out of the handicapped stall\\
42 - so we could have more room!\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
52 - What is Brooke's deal, man?\\
53 - I mean, most girls lie about
doing it with me when they haven't.\\
54 - This... The...
Everything is backwards.\\
55 - Yeah, this is just
like Freaky Friday,\\
56 - but unlike that
charming little movie,\\
57 - your story has no basis in fact.\\
58 - It does, too, except it's
just the girl is avoiding me.\\
59 - I mean, how do you get a girl to
come to you when you repulse her?\\
60 - Yeah, Eric?\\
61 - Well, I like to put a hot dog
on the end of a stick\\
62 - and hide in the bushes, so...\\
63 - Donna, so how do you
know Brooke, anyway?\\
64 - Did you guys jump out of a
cake together or something?\\
65 - Yeah! No, moron.\\
66 - When she was a senior we
worked on the school paper together.\\
67 - I think you know Brooke 'cause
there's a secret club in this town\\
68 - made up of all the hot girls.\\
69 - It's the secret hot girls club.\\
70 - There's no
secret hot girls club.\\
71 - Believe me, I'd know.\\
72 - Uh-huh.
Well, I'm gonna take off.\\
73 - I have to get to
my secret hot girls meeting.\\
74 - Oops!\\
75 - Why doesn't Brooke like me?\\
76 - I am a gentleman.\\
77 - Oh, yeah, you lied about doing it
with a hot girl in the men's room.\\
78 - You're Cary Grant.\\
79 - Steven, you've been quiet.\\
80 - Do you think Brooke's hot?\\
81 - Do you really want me
to answer that question?\\
82 - Oh, I think we all do.\\
83 - Steven, it's no big deal.\\
84 - Do you think she's hot?\\
85 - Oh, well, I guess since you're not
setting a trap, I can answer honestly.\\
86 - Yeah, she's freaking hot.\\
87 - A-ha! See, I trapped you.\\
88 - Now take it back
or I'll pinch you.\\
89 - Jackie, if you pinch me, it's gonna cause
a serious problem in this relationship.\\
90 - Fine.\\
91 - Ow!\\
92 - Oh, hey, Jackie.\\
93 - Are any of your
college-bound friends vir-gins?\\
94 - It's pronounced virgins, Fez.\\
95 - What?
But, no, but Hyde said...\\
96 - Oh, you magnificent bastard.\\
97 - Sorry, buddy.\\
98 - By the way,
it's pronounced bas-tard.\\
99 - Fez, if you wanna find virgins,\\
100 - go where ugly girls
pray to get pretty,\\
101 - the local House of Worship.\\
102 - House of Worship?\\
103 - Are you sure you don't
mean the House of Pies?\\
104 - No, Fez,
I mean the House of Worship.\\
105 - I'm going to the House of Pies.\\
106 - So, how's it going
at Point Place Junior College?\\
107 - Well,
the education's not too great,\\
108 - but the upside is
it's next to the Dairy Queen.\\
109 - First day of class, we all got
free Peanut Buster Parfaits.\\
110 - Ooh!\\
111 - Hey, guys.\\
112 - Kelso, what are you doing?\\
113 - I'm looking for
Brooke's phone number.\\
114 - I mean, why won't she admit
that we did it?\\
115 - Kelso, there are racehorses
and there are donkeys,\\
116 - and you are a great donkey.
You are, like, top donkey.\\
117 - But she's a racehorse,
and guess what?\\
118 - She don't want no donkey.\\
119 - She might.\\
120 - Look,
we had a great time together,\\
121 - and not just
'cause of the sex part,\\
122 - but because we had
a really great time.\\
123 - Donna, please help me find her.\\
124 - Okay, I'll give you a hint
about where she works.\\
125 - It's in a quiet building,\\
126 - you could try to
check her out on a date,\\
127 - but she's probably
booked for the future.\\
128 - She's a travel agent?\\
129 - She translated her love
of books into a career.\\
130 - She's a translator.\\
131 - She's the translator,
not me, Donna.\\
132 - You know, enough
with these brain teasers.\\
133 - You tell me where Brooke works,\\
134 - and I'll return your
underpants to safety.\\
135 - Kelso, aren't you a little old
to be stealing Donna's undies?\\
136 - A collector never
stops collecting, Eric.\\
137 - The library, Kelso.
She works in the library.\\
138 - Now will you put my
underwear back, you perv?\\
139 - I lied.\\
140 - Wow, those male
actors are gorgeous.\\
141 - You know, I think that
Robert Redford is so hot.\\
142 - He's hotter than the sun.\\
143 - He's extremely handsome.\\
144 - You know who I think is sexy?\\
145 - James Caan in The Godfather.\\
146 - Now, if he made me an offer,
I sure couldn't refuse.\\
147 - Yowza!\\
148 - Do you mind?\\
149 - I'm sorry.\\
150 - I thought we were
having a conversation.\\
151 - You know what, Steven?
I actually think\\
152 - that every guy on TV,
and in life,\\
153 - is hotter than you.\\
154 - Jackie, I know what
you're doing, okay?\\
155 - I said Brooke was hot, and
now you're totally insecure.\\
156 - Oh, I am not insecure, okay?\\
157 - This is a designer sweater,\\
158 - this is designer eye shadow,\\
159 - and those are designer shoes,\\
160 - and they make me
feel incredibly secure.\\
161 - You know who else I like?\\
162 - That little fellow
who plays Columbo.\\
163 - I just wanna give him a bath.\\
164 - Steven, why can't you just say
that Brooke's not hot?\\
165 - It's common
relationship courtesy.\\
166 - If you can't do this,
what will you do when I'm old\\
167 - and ask you if I have
crow's feet around my eyes?\\
168 - By the way,
that's already starting.\\
169 - You've never been in a
relationship, have you, son?\\
170 - What, when she asked if Brooke was
hot, I should have lied and said, "No"?\\
171 - Being honest and screwing
yourself is clearly the better plan.\\
172 - Sweetie, white lies
help relationships.\\
173 - Like, "Kitty, even though
your pot roast was overdone,\\
174 - "I still loved it."\\
175 - Oh, for the love of God,
I did love it.\\
176 - You're a pot roast genius, okay?\\
177 - It was like eating gold.\\
178 - So, you're saying lying is good?\\
179 - Exactly.\\
180 - Now go do the right thing,
and lie to the woman you love.\\
181 - Red, this is crazy, right?\\
182 - Yeah, they're all nuts.\\
183 - Except you, sweetheart.\\
184 - Look at all the smart,
lonely girls.\\
185 - Little ones, big ones. It's
like a virgin pumpkin patch.\\
186 - Can I help you?\\
187 - Yes, I'd like
an order of books, please.\\
188 - Could you be more specific?\\
189 - Could you be more beautiful?\\
190 - Could you be more lame?\\
191 - Yes.\\
192 - Excuse me, I'm trying to read.\\
193 - Don't be a sissy.\\
194 - You know what?\\
195 - Here's a firecracker,
go live a little.\\
196 - Thanks.\\
197 - Look, I know why you're here
and I'm sorry, you're not my type.\\
198 - I was high school valedictorian
and you're the antithesis of that.\\
199 - The anti-who of what?\\
200 - Exactly.\\
201 - Okay. No, come on.
Don't be like that, okay?\\
202 - Look, I really like you,\\
203 - and I just thought that maybe
we could go out some time,\\
204 - like, for coffee.
And then, if that went good,\\
205 - then we could go to a movie.\\
206 - And then, when we really
start to trust each other,\\
207 - you can tell my friends how we
did it at the Molly Hatchet concert.\\
208 - Look, I don't make it
with guys at concerts.\\
209 - I read two periodicals a week
about the Dewey Decimal system,\\
210 - which I'm sure
you've never heard of.\\
211 - Okay, I have heard
of Dewey Decimal.\\
212 - It's Donald Duck's nephew.\\
213 - I can't believe Brooke.\\
214 - I mean, standing there at
the library, totally resisting me.\\
215 - I can't believe
we have a library.\\
216 - I know,
what is it, like, invisible?\\
217 - No, no, you know that parking
lot where we drink beer in?\\
218 - Okay, well, you know that wall
that we lean up against?\\
219 - That's the library.\\
220 - Oh!\\
221 - Well, then guess who has
peed on the library?\\
222 - You know what?
For the first time in my life,\\
223 - I hope that there's not a secret
hot girls club, because if there is,\\
224 - I bet Brooke said awful things
about me at their last meeting.\\
225 - Order, bitches.\\
226 - The secret hot girls
club is now in session.\\
227 - Now, last meeting we
all decided to go braless,\\
228 - and I just wanna report
that Operation Bazooma Bounce\\
229 - - is driving the boys insane.
- Ah!\\
230 - Hi, my name is Brooke and
I've been a hot girl for 6 years.\\
231 - Hi, Brooke.\\
232 - And I just wanna let everyone know
that Michael Kelso asked me out,\\
233 - and I resisted his charms
and turned him down.\\
234 - - But he's irresistible.
- That's what I thought,
but it's a lie.\\
235 - A lie, I tell you.\\
236 - Then it's official.\\
237 - No secret hot girl will ever
date Michael Kelso ever again.\\
238 - Okay,
that's great, that's great.\\
239 - Now this calls for
dancing bubble kiss time.\\
240 - Kelso, there is no
secret hot girls club.\\
241 - Well, of course,
the president won't admit it.\\
242 - You know, I don't care
if there's a club or not,\\
243 - dancing bubble kiss time
is just a fabulous idea.\\
244 - Well, all I know
is that Brooke and I\\
245 - had a romantic night together
at the concert.\\
246 - Why is she pretending
like it didn't happen?\\
247 - Well, maybe she's embarrassed.\\
248 - I mean, she's used to dating
really brainy guys.\\
249 - Yeah, not guys who set
their own pants on fire.\\
250 - On a dare.\\
251 - And I won a dollar.\\
252 - Kelso, if you want
Brooke to like you,\\
253 - you know, maybe you
should go to the library\\
254 - - and show her
you can be smart.
- I hate the library.\\
255 - The only good thing about it is
that you can check out Playboys.\\
256 - I mean, they have every issue
since it started.\\
257 - Wait, every issue?\\
258 - Are you telling me that they have
the one with Pamela Sue Martin,\\
259 - television's Nancy Drew, in a grotto,
straddling the world's luckiest boulder?\\
260 - They have periodicals, you say?\\
261 - What is wrong with Steven?\\
262 - I mean, why won't he just say
Brooke's not hot?\\
263 - Because he
doesn't know how to lie.\\
264 - He's an orphan.\\
265 - He never had
a mother to teach him how.\\
266 - I mean, how do I know he
loves me if he doesn't obey me?\\
267 - Well, you've chosen
a strong man, Jackie,\\
268 - and they don't always obey.\\
269 - Now, do I think he should have
said that other girl wasn't pretty? Yes.\\
270 - But you have to
pick your battles.\\
271 - Wait, no, I wanna be
right all the time.\\
272 - And you will be.\\
273 - After a few years they just...
They give up.\\
274 - Okay, watch.\\
275 - Red, could you go to the drug store
and get me a Ladies' Home Journal?\\
276 - But I just...\\
277 - It's all frosty.\\
278 - Oh, crap!\\
279 - Jackpot, my friend.\\
280 - Not only did I get Nancy Drew,
but I also got Margot Kidder,\\
281 - Superman's Lois Lane,
in an outfit that,\\
282 - let's just say, you don't need
x-ray vision to appreciate.\\
283 - Get those out of here, man.\\
284 - I'm trying to impress Brooke
with my intelligence.\\
285 - Here she comes.\\
286 - Say, Eric, this encyclopedia
of scientific terms\\
287 - has really taught me something.\\
288 - See, by lifting this encyclopedia
of scientific terms above my head,\\
289 - I'm using my
body's stored energy,\\
290 - also known as uranium.\\
291 - Um, actually,
it's known as calories,\\
292 - but I do believe at some point
you were exposed to radiation.\\
293 - All right, look, I don't know
what you have against me,\\
294 - but I'm not leaving here until I
convince you to go out with me.\\
295 - That's the man who gave me
the firecrackers, Mom.\\
296 - I gotta run.\\
297 - You wanna check something out?\\
298 - No. Is there someone else
that can help me?\\
299 - Like a man.\\
300 - So, you wanna check out
those Playboys, or not?\\
301 - Okay, fine.\\
302 - I'm a man.
I would like these Playboys.\\
303 - Well, you can't have them.\\
304 - I want you to get in your car, buy
some flowers, give them to Donna,\\
305 - and thank God an actual
live woman lets you touch her.\\
306 - Yes, ma'am.\\
307 - Okay, Steven, I think I figured
out a way to end this situation\\
308 - where everybody wins.\\
309 - Now, listen to this
question carefully.\\
310 - Is there anyone you
said was hot, like Brooke,\\
311 - who you really don't
think is hot, like Brooke?\\
312 - Well, I could lie and say yes.\\
313 - Then do it. I don't care
if you don't mean it.\\
314 - It's the words that count.\\
315 - Jackie, I'm not gonna lie.\\
316 - Fine. Then you know what?
I don't know how to fix this.\\
317 - Pick your battles...\\
318 - Fine.\\
319 - Steven, I don't care if you think she's
hot, because that's how you really feel.\\
320 - Thank you.\\
321 - Hey, Steven, will you go to the drug
store and get me a Vogue magazine?\\
322 - But I just...\\
323 - It's gonna melt.\\
324 - Crap!\\
325 - Well, my plan to have
sex with virgins failed.\\
326 - So I've widened my search
from virgins to everyone.\\
327 - Basically, you're back to
where you started this morning.\\
328 - Not really, I had some pie.\\
329 - I've done less in a day.\\
330 - Well, Donna, turns out Brooke
doesn't like intelligent men.\\
331 - Kelso, you didn't have sex
with her, man, just let it go.\\
332 - Michael, I need to talk to you.\\
333 - Yeah, about what?\\
334 - About our night together
at the Molly Hatchet concert.\\
335 - Excuse me.\\
336 - Burn!\\
337 - Burn!\\
338 - Burn! Burn!\\
339 - Burn! Burn!\\
340 - Burn.\\
341 - We totally did it!\\
342 - Michael, I just
found out I'm pregnant.\\
343 - I never touched her.\\
344 - Psst! Kid, hey, see this?\\
345 - That's a Playboy.\\
346 - And inside are things
beyond your wildest dreams,\\
347 - magical, glorious things.\\
348 - So if I toss it in your book
and you check it out for me,\\
349 - I'll let you have a look-see.
What do you say?\\
350 - You're pathetic. Just go
buy a Playboy, you loser.\\
351 - Loser? Hey, I'm not the one
reading Hardy Boys.\\
352 - For your information, the stolen money
was hidden in the grandfather clock!\\
353 - Who's the loser now?

WINE AWAY FROM MAKING OUT.\\

10 - KELSO, DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT\\
11 - TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW?\\

ACTION, I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.\\
14 - HOW ABOUT THE FACT\\
15 - THAT BROOKE'S GOT YOUR
FEEBLE-MINDED BUN IN HER OVEN.\\
16 - LOOK, SHE CAN'T

GIRLS LIE ABOUT, OKAY?\\
19 - I WOULD KNOW. I'M AN
EXPERT ON GIRL LIES.\\
20 - KELSO, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.\\
21 - NO, BUT DOING SOMETHING
IS NOT IN MY NATURE.\\
22 - "IGNORE," "AVOID,"
"RUN AWAY"...\\
23 - THESE WORDS HAVE BEEN
VERY GOOD TO ME.\\
24 - YOU'RE HORRIBLE.\\

BASED ON LOVE. RIGHT, HONEY?\\
40 - DON'T TOUCH ME.\\
41 - FINE. I'LL GIVE YOU 20 BUCKS
TO PRETEND TO BE MY WIFE.\\
42 - THAT'S GOTTA
SOUND FAMILIAR.\\
43 - STEVEN, IF YOU KEEP DOING
THAT, IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD\\
44 - FOR ME TO PRETEND I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.\\
45 - THEN I SHOULD GO
BECAUSE IT'S JUST TOO EASY...\\
46 - LIKE LAURIE.\\
47 - WHEN IS THIS I.N.S. MAN
GONNA BE HERE?\\
48 - SOMETIME THIS WEEK.
IT'S A SURPRISE VISIT.\\
49 - SO I HAVE
TO STAY HERE.\\

51 - WITH RED? OH, NO.
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.\\
52 - WHY NOT?
RED LOVES ME.\\
53 - HONEY, YOU GAVE HIM
A HEART ATTACK.\\
54 - MAYBE HE JUST
LOVES FEZ SO MUCH\\

56 - PLEASE, MISS KITTY,
LET ME STAY.\\

78 - WHAT IS THIS DOING HERE?\\
79 - OKAY, RED, HE JUST HAS TO
STAY HERE FOR A FEW DAYS.\\
80 - BUT KITTY,
HE WAS IN MY SHOWER.\\
81 - HE SAW MY LEGS.\\
82 - AND HE SAW PEPE.\\
83 - SHUT UP.\\
84 - LISTEN, DAD,
THE I.N.S. IS COMING,\\
85 - AND IF THEY FIND OUT

THIS MESS OF A MARRIAGE.\\
94 - SHE'S INNOCENT

CAUGHT UP IN THIS\\
96 - IS BECAUSE
SHE LOVES TOO MUCH.\\
97 - WELL,
THAT LAST PART'S TRUE.\\
98 - j&j&j&\\
99 - SHOOT, IT'S BROOKE.
HIDE ME.\\
100 - HEY!\\
101 - I'M SORRY, DONNA. SQUEEZING
YOUR BUTT GIVES ME COURAGE.\\
102 - SO, MICHAEL...\\
103 - YOU SPLIT PRETTY QUICK
THE OTHER DAY.\\
104 - MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
OR SOMETHING.\\
105 - YOU GOT IT.\\
106 - ONE SEC.\\
107 - KELSO!\\
108 - DONNA, LET GO OF MY LEG!\\
109 - I SWEAR I GOT NO PROBLEM
KICKING A GIRL!\\
110 - LOOK, YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF
STUPID CRAP OVER THE YEARS...\\
111 - YOU STOLE MY PANTIES.\\
112 - YOU TIED MY HAMSTER
TO A BOTTLE ROCKET.\\
113 - AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY TIMES\\
114 - I CAUGHT YOU PEEPING
THROUGH MY WINDOW.\\
115 - FIVE.\\
116 - LOOK, THE POINT IS,
I LET IT ALL SLIDE\\
117 - BECAUSE UNDERNEATH I KNEW
YOU WERE A GOOD GUY.\\
118 - BUT IF YOU BAIL ON BROOKE,\\
119 - I WILL NEVER
RESPECT YOU AGAIN,\\
120 - AND NEITHER
WILL ANYBODY ELSE.\\
121 - LOOK, I KNOW, OKAY?
I KNOW.\\
122 - I JUST...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.\\
123 - WELL, KELSO, YOU NEED
TO GO TALK TO HER.\\
124 - OKAY.
GOOD.\\
125 - WHAT?\\
126 - "TOUCH DONNA PINCIOTTI'S
PANTIES FOR 5 BUCKS.\\
127 - CALL MICHAEL KELSO"?\\
128 - j&j&j&\\
129 - AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER TASTED CHOCOLATE.\\
130 - THAT'S
A GREAT STORY, MAN,\\
131 - BUT, UH, IT'S LIKE
2:00 IN THE MORNING.\\
132 - SO WE GOTTA GO TO SLEEP.\\
133 - BUT I FORGOT MY TAPE
OF MY OCEAN SOUNDS.\\
134 - AND I CANNOT FALL ASLEEP
WITHOUT IT.\\
135 - CAN YOU MAKE
OCEAN SOUNDS FOR ME?\\
136 - YEAH,
I'M NOT DOING THAT.\\
137 - OKAY,
THEN LET ME TELL YOU\\
138 - ABOUT THE FIRST TIME
I ATE A BLOW POP.\\
139 - LICK NUMBER ONE...
WHAT A SURPRISE.\\
140 - YOU ARE FORGETTING
THE WHALE SONGS.\\
141 - LISTEN, MAN, I'VE ONLY
BEEN TO THE OCEAN ONCE,\\
142 - AND THE CLOSEST THING
I SAW TO A WHALE\\
143 - WAS SOME FAT GUY
SELLING DRUGS.\\
144 - FINE. LICK NUMBER TWO...
STILL NO GUM?\\
145 - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING TO YOURSELF?!\\
146 - OH, GREAT, DAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT?\\
147 - YOU WOKE HIM UP,
YOU PUT HIM BACK TO SLEEP!\\
148 - j&j&j&\\
149 - HEY.\\
150 - UH...\\
151 - IT'S BEEN
POINTED OUT TO ME\\
152 - THAT I'VE BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE FLAKY ABOUT, UM...\\
153 - OUR SITUATION.\\
154 - I DISAGREE. FLAKY MEANS
YOU'RE NOT CONSISTENT.\\
155 - YOU RUN AWAY
EVERY TIME YOU SEE ME.\\
156 - ANYWAY, UH...\\
157 - I THINK WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.\\
158 - I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA WANT ME
TO MEET YOUR PARENTS,\\
159 - AND LUCKY FOR YOU,
I LOOK GOOD IN A SUIT.\\
160 - HELL, I LOOK GOOD IN ANYTHING,
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.\\
161 - ACTUALLY, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.\\
162 - AS FAR AS THE BABY
AND I ARE CONCERNED,\\
163 - YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.\\
164 - SO, YOU'RE JUST
LETTING ME GO?\\
165 - YEP.\\
166 - YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THIS EVER AGAIN.\\
167 - AND I WON'T!\\
168 - WOW! YOU'RE LIKE
THE COOLEST GIRL\\
169 - I EVER DID IT WITH
AT A CONCERT!\\
170 - j&j&j&\\
171 - OH, HONEY,
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.\\
172 - OH, YOU DON'T LOOK
SO HOT YOURSELF, SISTER.\\
173 - I BEG YOUR PARDON.\\
174 - RED MADE ME SLEEP
IN THE BASEMENT,\\
175 - AND EVERY TIME I STARTED
TO FALL ASLEEP,\\
176 - HYDE WOULD PUT
A POPSICLE ON MY NECK.\\
177 - THAT'S
MY DADDY'S CHAIR.\\
178 - THAT'S MY DADDY'S CHAIR.\\
179 - FEZ, LOOK, MAN,\\
180 - YOU GOTTA START
KISSING RED'S BUTT A LITTLE,\\
181 - OR HE'S GONNA MAKE
SURE YOU GET DEPORTED.\\
182 - HE SHOULD BE KISSING
MY BUTT\\
183 - FOR TAKING HIS TRASHY
DAUGHTER OFF HIS HANDS.\\
184 - I'M NOT THAT TRASHY.\\
185 - I WON'T
SLEEP WITH YOU.\\
186 - OH, ZIP IT, JEZEBEL.\\
187 - OUT OF MY CHAIR, TONTO.\\
188 - OH, COME ON.
A CHAIR IS A CHAIR.\\
189 - BRANCH OUT A LITTLE.
TRY THE PIANO BENCH.\\
190 - WHAT DID YOU SAY?\\
191 - LAURIE, GO GET
A CUP OF MILK.\\
192 - WHY?\\
193 - IT'LL KEEP
FEZ'S TEETH ALIVE\\
194 - UNTIL WE GET HIM
TO THE DENTIST.\\
195 - HI, SIR. HAL ARMSTRONG FROM
THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE.\\
196 - I'M HERE TO CONDUCT
SOME INTERVIEWS.\\
197 - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
'CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.\\
198 - IS IT TOO LATE TO GIVE
YOU BACK YOUR CHAIR?\\
199 - OH, NO,
DON'T GET UP.\\
200 - THIS COULD BE THE LAST
TIME YOU SIT ON FURNITURE\\
201 - THAT YOU DIDN'T BUILD
OUT OF MUD AND TWIGS.\\
202 - j&j&j&\\
203 - SO, AGENT ARMSTRONG,\\
204 - CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE.\\
205 - YOU GOT HANDCUFFS, RIGHT?\\
206 - RED. RED, WHY DON'T YOU
HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN?\\
207 - LAURIE, MAKE OUR GUEST
COMFORTABLE.\\
208 - HEY, G-MAN.\\
209 - OKAY, RED, JUST BECAUSE
HE SAT IN YOUR CHAIR\\
210 - IS NO REASON TO GET
THE BOY DEPORTED.\\
211 - YOU DON'T LIKE ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT FROM HERE.\\
212 - THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO\\
213 - WITH YOU
BEING A FOREIGNER.\\
214 - IT'S ABOUT YOU TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF MY DAUGHTER\\
215 - LIKE A SNEAKY FOREIGNER.\\
216 - WAIT, DAD, LOOK.\\
217 - I STAYED HOME FROM COLLEGE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND MOM\\
218 - IN YOUR HOUR OF NEED.
OKAY, YOU OWE ME.\\
219 - THAT IS JUST LIKE A
WOMAN TO BRING THAT UP.\\
220 - YOU KNOW, LAURIE COULD GET
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, TOO.\\
221 - WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE?\\
222 - BIG TROUBLE, DAD.
SHE COULD GO TO JAIL...\\
223 - OR BACK TO JAIL.\\
224 - WELL, COME ON.
IT'S LIKE...\\
225 - WHERE HAS SHE BEEN
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS?\\
226 - ALL RIGHT, FINE,
I WON'T VOLUNTEER ANYTHING.\\
227 - BUT IF HE ASKS ME A DIRECT
QUESTION, I'M NOT LYING.\\
228 - OH, YOU WON'T HAVE TO. I'LL
DO ALL THE TALKING FOR YOU.\\
229 - WELL,
YOU'LL BE GOOD AT THAT.\\
230 - AND I GUESS IT MIGHT
BE FUN TO JUST SIT BACK\\
231 - AND WATCH TARZAN HERE\\
232 - CRUMBLE BEFORE THE FULL FORCE
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.\\
233 - OKAY, THAT'S IT.
ANWAR I CAN DEAL WITH.\\
234 - TONTO, IN THE BALLPARK,
BUT TARZAN...\\
235 - TARZAN IS A WHITE GUY.\\
236 - DON'T SASS ME, TARZAN.\\
237 - MICHAEL,
THERE IS NO WAY\\
238 - BROOKE SAID
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.\\
239 - OKAY, I BET SHE SAID, "I'M GONNA
TAKE EVERY PENNY YOU HAVE,\\
240 - "YOU IRRESPONSIBLE BASTARD,"
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.\\
241 - NO. SHE DEFINITELY SAID
"OFF THE HOOK."\\
242 - MAN, I AM ONE TALL,
CUTE, LUCKY KID.\\
243 - SO THAT'S IT, MAN?\\
244 - IT'S LIKE THIS THING WITH YOU
AND BROOKE NEVER HAPPENED?\\
245 - YEAH. WAIT, NO.\\
246 - I MEAN, THERE'S STILL GONNA
BE A BABY OUT THERE. BUT...\\
247 - MY LIFE'S
BACK TO NORMAL.\\
248 - SORTA.\\
249 - I MEAN,
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.\\
250 - I'M NOT GONNA THINK ABOUT IT
'CAUSE I DON'T NEED TO.\\
251 - I SHOULD BE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW.\\
252 - YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM HAPPY RIGHT NOW.\\
253 - YEAH. I THINK.\\
254 - YEAH, THINK, FEEL,
LOOK DEEP INSIDE,\\
255 - LIKE DEEP, DEEP
INSIDE ALMOST TO CHINA.\\
256 - THERE'S A GOOD GUY
IN THERE.\\
257 - YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T LECTURE ME, OKAY?\\
258 - I WENT TO HER, AND I
TRIED TO TALK TO HER,\\
259 - AND SHE SAID IT WAS
COOL, WHICH IS AWESOME,\\
260 - BECAUSE THIS COULD, LIKE,
SCREW UP MY WHOLE LIFE.\\
261 - YEAH, MAN, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOTTA STAY FOCUSED\\
262 - IF YOU'RE GONNA INVENT
THOSE QUADRUPLE OREOS.\\
263 - THOSE ARE A SECRET, MAN.\\
264 - NO, YEAH,
THIS IS GOOD.\\
265 - WHY PUT YOURSELF OUT
FOR SOME KID?\\
266 - CHILDREN GROW UP
WITHOUT DADS ALL THE TIME.\\
267 - RIGHT.\\
268 - YEAH,
LIKE STEVEN.\\
269 - WELL, I DON'T WANT HIM
ENDING UP LIKE HYDE.\\
270 - WITH HAIR ALL FRIZZED OUT
WITH ANGRY THOUGHTS.\\
271 - OW!\\
272 - AND VIOLENT, TOO.\\
273 - KELSO, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO,\\
274 - BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A TOOL.\\
275 - YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S REAL EASY\\
276 - TO TALK ABOUT
THE RIGHT THING TO DO\\
277 - WHEN IT'S NOT
YOUR LIFE.\\
278 - TOOL.\\
279 - OH, STEVEN, YOU'RE
SENSITIVE TO THIS\\
280 - BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
DITCHED YOU, TOO.\\
281 - THAT IS SO FOXY.\\
282 - HEY, WHY DON'T WE
GO DOWN TO MY ROOM,\\
283 - I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TIME\\
284 - MY MOM GOT SO LOADED
ON MOUTHWASH,\\
285 - SHE LOST OUR RENT MONEY
AT THE TRACK.\\
286 - OKAY, YOU TWO CLAIM TO
BE MARRIED AND LIVING HERE.\\
287 - TO VERIFY THIS,\\
288 - I'M GOING TO
SEPARATE YOU ALL\\
289 - AND ASK YOU A SERIES OF
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COUPLE.\\
290 - LET ME REMIND YOU,
YOU'RE ALL UNDER OATH.\\
291 - UNDER OATH?\\
292 - I MEAN...\\
293 - UNDER OATH, BRAVO.\\
294 - OKAY, FIRST QUESTION...\\
295 - WHAT KIND OF TOOTHPASTE
DOES FEZ USE?\\
296 - I BRUSH MY TEETH
WITH COLGATE.\\
297 - IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT
CUTS THROUGH THE MILK DUDS.\\
298 - WHO THE HELL CARES
ABOUT TOOTHPASTE?\\
299 - THIS KID AND
MY DAUGHTER ARE...\\
300 - HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!\\
301 - I... WAIT,
WHY AM I UNDER OATH?\\
302 - 'CAUSE IF I SAY CREST AND
THE ANSWER IS MINTY CREST,\\
303 - I MEAN, THAT'S LIKE,
UH, PERJURY.\\
304 - WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO ME?\\
305 - OH, MY GOD, WHY ARE YOU
WRITING THIS DOWN?\\
306 - HOW LONG DID FEZ AND LAURIE
DATE BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED?\\
307 - WHO NEEDS TO DATE?
I HAD HER IN THE SACK\\
308 - FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY
"CORN ON THE COB."\\
309 - SPEAKING OF DATES, I MAKE
AN INCREDIBLE DATE-NUT BREAD.\\
310 - THE SECRET IS TO SOAK THE
DATES IN SOME GOOD STRONG RUM.\\
311 - WHICH REMINDS ME,
WHO NEEDS A DRINK?\\
312 - I KNOW I DO.\\
313 - I... I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THEY DATED.\\
314 - I... OH, MY GOD, I'M GOING
TO PRISON, AREN'T I?\\
315 - I'M GONNA GET SHANKED.\\
316 - WHAT IS FEZ'S
FAVORITE TV SHOW?\\
317 - WELL, IT DEPENDS.\\
318 - BASICALLY, I JUST FLIP
UNTIL I SEE NIPPLES.\\
319 - SOMETIMES, I FEEL LIKE
A LOAF OF BREAD.\\
320 - EVERYONE KEEPS TAKING
A SLICE OF ME\\
321 - UNTIL ALL THAT'S LEFT ARE TWO
CRUSTY PIECES THAT NOBODY WANTS.\\
322 - AND I JUST WANT TO SCREAM,
"APPRECIATE ME, DAMN IT."\\
323 - BUT I DON'T. WHY?\\
324 - BECAUSE MY MOTHER
ALWAYS TOLD ME\\
325 - THAT NICE GIRLS
SHOULDN'T MAKE A FUSS.\\
326 - AND NOW, I AM
A FLIPPIN' DOORMAT!\\
327 - OKAY, LOOK, MAN.\\
328 - PRISON IS NOT
AN OPTION FOR ME, OKAY?\\
329 - I CAN'T PEE
IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE.\\
330 - WELL...\\
331 - DESPITE A FEW
INTERESTING ANSWERS\\
332 - AND ONE RECIPE...\\
333 - MY JUDGMENT IS THAT YOUR
MARRIAGE IS LEGITIMATE.\\
334 - CONGRATULATIONS.\\
335 - ALL RIGHT,
PEPE AND I ARE AMERICANS.\\
336 - NO WONDER THIS COUNTRY'S
GOING IN THE TOILET.\\
337 - WHAT WAS THAT, SIR?\\
338 - NOTHING. NOTHING. HE SAID
HE HAS TO USE THE TOILET.\\
339 - THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN
SO QUIET.\\
340 - IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT
YOUR DAUGHTER, DON'T WORRY.\\
341 - WE NEVER GO AFTER
THE BRIDE,\\
342 - ESPECIALLY
SUCH A PRETTY ONE.\\
343 - IF THERE WAS
A CRIME COMMITTED,\\
344 - WE'D ONLY BE INTERESTED
IN THIS ONE.\\
345 - SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO SAY, BY ALL MEANS, SAY IT.\\
346 - FINE, I WILL.\\
347 - I JUST WANTED TO SAY...\\
348 - THESE TWO KIDS
ARE MARRIED AND...\\
349 - VERY MUCH IN LOVE.\\
350 - IN FACT, I'VE NEVER SEEN
A LOVE LIKE THIS.\\
351 - THANK YOU, MR. RED.
IT MEANS A LOT.\\
352 - HEY, WHAT ABOUT
THANKING ME?\\
353 - THIS GUY TRIED
TO BREAK ME.\\
354 - BUT LUCKY FOR YOU, DOUBLE-O
FOREMAN IS ROCK SOLID.\\
355 - WOW, YOU REALLY
ARE PREGNANT.\\
356 - THEY MAKE THEM
REALLY TINY NOW.\\
357 - QUARTER POUND,
MY ASS.\\
358 - HEY.\\
359 - I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.\\
360 - KELSO, THAT'S GREAT!\\
361 - HERE, TAKE MY SEAT.
SIT DOWN. COME ON.\\
362 - I'LL JUST BE
RIGHT OVER THERE.\\
363 - GOOD FOR YOU.\\
364 - ALL RIGHT.\\
365 - AT FIRST, WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT I WAS OFF THE HOOK,\\
366 - I WAS LIKE
TOTALLY PSYCHED, RIGHT?\\
367 - BUT THEN I STARTED
TO THINK ABOUT IT,\\
368 - AND I DON'T WANNA BE
OFF THE HOOK.\\
369 - I WANNA BE A PART
OF THIS KID'S LIFE.\\
370 - MICHAEL, I DIDN'T LET YOU
OFF THE HOOK TO BE NICE.\\
371 - I JUST DON'T THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS\\
372 - TO HAVE A BABY.\\
373 - NO, BUT I DO.\\
374 - IT MEANS TAKING HIM
TO T-BALL GAMES\\
375 - AND TEACHING HIM
HOW TO RIDE A BIKE\\
376 - AND TAKING HIM TO THE
DOCTOR WHEN HE'S SICK.\\
377 - AND WHAT IF
IT'S A GIRL?\\
378 - OH, IT'S NOT GONNA BE A GIRL.
WE DID IT STANDING UP.\\
379 - UH-HUH.\\
380 - OKAY, MAYBE THIS WILL
CHANGE YOUR MIND.\\
381 - I WENT AND GOT
SOME STUFF TODAY\\
382 - TO WELCOME THE LITTLE GUY
INTO THE WORLD...\\
383 - THIS LITTLE SWEATER
TO KEEP HIM WARM.\\
384 - AND THIS LITTLE HAT TO KEEP
THE SUN OFF OF HIS FACE.\\
385 - AND I GOT SOME POP ROCKS\\
386 - 'CAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE
A BABY EAT POP ROCKS.\\
387 - MICHAEL,
IF YOU GET INVOLVED,\\
388 - I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TWO
BABIES TO TAKE CARE OF\\
389 - INSTEAD OF ONE.\\
390 - LOOK, YOU CAN TRY
TO GET RID OF ME,\\
391 - BUT I'M NOT
WALKING AWAY FROM THIS.\\
392 - I'M SORRY.\\
393 - I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
BE THE FATHER OF MY CHILD.\\
394 - THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.\\
395 - YEAH, "GO TALK TO HER
AND DO THE RIGHT THING."\\
396 - KELSO, I'M SO SORRY.\\
397 - I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I
COULD DO TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.\\
398 - WELL, THERE ISN'T.\\
399 - OKAY, FINE.\\
400 - I'LL GIVE YOU
10 SECONDS\\
401 - TO SQUEEZE MY ASS
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT.\\
402 - I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,\\
403 - BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS
THAT A GIRL'S ASS CAN'T FIX.\\
404 - WELL, FEZ, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR GREEN CARD.\\
405 - BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS AMERICA,
AND YOU STILL LOOK FOREIGN,\\
406 - SO DON'T EXPECT
TO BE TREATED EQUALLY.\\
407 - WELL, I'M GOING
TO BECOME\\
408 - AMERICA'S SEXIEST
SINGING COWBOY.\\
409 - HOWDY, LADIES.
MEET PEPE.\\
410 - YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH BROOKE REALLY HURTS,\\
411 - BUT I THINK IN A COUPLE DAYS
WHEN I START TO HEAL,\\
412 - I'M GONNA BE REALLY PSYCHED
THAT DONNA LET ME SQUEEZE HER ASS.\\
413 - I MEAN, EVEN NOW, I'M
REFLECTING UPON HOW SOFT IT WAS.\\
414 - SO WHAT KIND OF CHANCE DO YOU
THINK I HAVE WITH THE BLONDE?
\subsection {Episode 06: We're Not Gonna Take It}

8 - WELL, HONEY, DON'T WORRY.\\

WE'LL LICK SALT.\\
12 - I DON'T KNOW
IT'S LIKE,\\
13 - WHY WOULD
JOANNE FIRE ME?\\
14 - BOB, SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?\\
15 - ERIC, IX-NAY
ON THE OANNE-JAY.\\
16 - DONNA, YOU KNOW I DON'T
UNDERSTAND PIG LATIN.\\
17 - BOB, WHAT IS
JOANNE'S PROBLEM?\\
18 - ERIC, "IX-NAY"
MEANS "SHUT UP."\\
19 - IT'S OKAY, HONEY.
I CAN TALK ABOUT IT.\\
20 - ME AND JOANNE
BROKE UP.\\
21 - AND I DIDN'T
SEE IT COMING.\\
22 - BOB, WHAT DID I TELL YOU
LAST WEEK?\\
23 - DON'T CRY
IN YOUR KITCHEN?\\
24 - AND I DIDN'T MEAN
JUST THAT DAY.\\
25 - I MEANT ALWAYS.\\
26 - I'D BETTER GO, THEN.\\
27 - NICE GOING,
ACKASS-JAY.\\
28 - ACKASS-JAY?\\
29 - OH! JACKASS.\\

YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MONEY,\\
33 - WITH DAD NOT BEING
ABLE TO WORK,\\
34 - BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M
GONNA GET RIGHT BACK OUT THERE\\

38 - IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO
THE PIE-IN-THE-SKY OFFICE.\\
39 - JACKASS.\\
40 - j&j&j&\\
41 - OH, REALLY? THANK YOU.\\
42 - WELL, THE JOB SEARCH

AT WASHING AN OLD MAN'S BACK\\
44 - ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.\\
45 - THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A
WAITER DOWN AT THE RESTAURANT.\\
46 - WHOA. WHY'D YOU TELL
HIM? I'M UP FOR THAT JOB.\\
47 - THAT'S WHY I TOLD HIM.\\
48 - NO, NO, NO.\\
49 - LOOK, ERIC, I NEED THIS
JOB WAY MORE THAN YOU DO.\\
50 - YOU DON'T HAVE
A BABY ON THE WAY.\\
51 - BUT I DO HAVE
A FAMILY TO SUPPORT.\\
52 - AND IF I DON'T KEEP
THE BOOZE FLOWING,\\
53 - THEY'RE GONNA GET VIOLENT.\\
54 - WELL, LOOK,\\
55 - THE ONLY WAY BROOKE
IS GONNA LET ME BE\\
56 - A PART OF MY KID'S
LIFE IS IF I PROVE TO HER\\
57 - THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE,
AND A PROMOTION\\
58 - AT THE RESTAURANT
WOULD IMPRESS HER.\\
59 - I MEAN, BUSBOY'S A JOB,
BUT WAITER IS A CAREER.\\
60 - OKAY, WELL,
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?\\
61 - WE'LL JUST BOTH
GO DOWN THERE, APPLY,\\
62 - AND MAY
THE BEST MAN WIN.\\
63 - NO, I WANT IT.\\
64 - j&j&j&\\
65 - HANGIN' OUT\\
66 - DOWN THE STREET\\
67 - THE SAME OLD THING\\
68 - WE DID LAST WEEK\\
69 - NOT A THING TO DO\\
70 - BUT TALK TO YOU\\
71 - WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHT\\
72 - WE'RE ALL ALL RIGHTj&\\
73 - Man: HELLO, WISCONSIN!\\
74 - j&j&j&\\

76 - WELL, LOOK WHAT
THE WHORE DRAGGED IN.\\
77 - HERSELF.\\
78 - NEED I REMIND YOU
THAT YOU ARE MARRIED?\\
79 - OH, THAT'S OKAY.\\
80 - THE GUY FROM LAST NIGHT
WAS MARRIED, TOO.\\
81 - WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?\\
82 - ARE YOU TWO
AT IT AGAIN?\\
83 - YOUR GREEN CARD
IS ON THE WAY.\\
84 - I THOUGHT
THIS MARRIAGE WAS OVER.\\
85 - LAURIE, I GAVE YOU $50
LAST WEEK TO GO DOWN\\
86 - TO THE COURTHOUSE
AND FILE FOR DIVORCE.\\
87 - WHAT HAPPENED?\\
88 - WELL, I HAD TO GET A NEW
MAKEUP MIRROR AND SOME WINE.\\
89 - TOMORROW, WE'RE GOING
TO THE COURTHOUSE.\\
90 - HMM. THE COURTHOUSE
IS ACROSS TOWN.\\
91 - I WONDER IF YOU CAN MAKE
IT ALL THE WAY THERE\\
92 - WITHOUT SLEEPING
WITH SOMEONE.\\
93 - I BET I CAN MAKE IT THERE
WITHOUT SLEEPING WITH YOU.\\
94 - BITCH.\\
95 - j&j&j&\\
96 - BOB...\\
97 - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
ANYWAY?\\
98 - IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I'M TRYING OUT.\\
99 - HOW'S IT GOING?\\
100 - IT'S A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE.\\
101 - I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER
THAN SITTING HOME ALONE.\\
102 - IT'S NOT.\\
103 - OH, MY POOR DAD.\\
104 - WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING I
COULD DO TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.\\
105 - WELL, ONCE WHEN I WAS SAD
ABOUT MICHAEL CHEATING ON ME,\\
106 - I GOT FLOWERS
FROM A SECRET ADMIRER,\\
107 - AND THEY CHEERED ME
RIGHT UP.\\
108 - I MEAN, SURE,
I SENT THEM TO MYSELF,\\
109 - BUT IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.\\
110 - THOSE FLOWERS WERE
FROM YOU?\\
111 - YOU LET ME GO
ON AND ON ABOUT HOW\\
112 - THEY WERE FROM ME.\\
113 - GOD, TRY A LITTLE
HONESTY.\\
114 - WAIT. THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A BAD IDEA.\\
115 - IF MY DAD THOUGHT
SOMEBODY ELSE LIKED HIM,\\
116 - HE WOULDN'T BE SO BUMMED
ABOUT JOANNE.\\
117 - BUT MEN DON'T REALLY
LIKE FLOWERS, DO THEY?\\
118 - NO, THEY REMIND US
OF BEES.\\
119 - OH, I'LL SEND HIM FUDGE.\\
120 - HE LOVES FUDGE. I KNOW
BECAUSE ONE TIME, HE GOT SOME,\\
121 - AND I ASKED
IF I COULD HAVE A PIECE,\\
122 - AND HE QUICKLY CHANGED
THE SUBJECT.\\
123 - WELL, LET ME TELL THEM
WHAT TO WRITE ON THE CARD.\\
124 - I'M GOOD AT THAT.\\
125 - WHEN I SENT MYSELF
THOSE FLOWERS\\
126 - AND READ HOW MUCH I LOVED ME,
I FELT SO MUCH BETTER.\\
127 - j&j&j&\\
128 - HEY, ROY. REMEMBER ME?
I'M ERIC FORMAN.\\
129 - OH, HEY, HOW ARE YOU?\\
130 - I'M HERE TO APPLY
FOR THE WAITER POSITION.\\
131 - ROY, THAT'S THE GUY
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.\\
132 - OH!\\
133 - WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN HIRE A WAITER\\
134 - WHO'S GOT A DISEASE THAT
SPREADS THROUGH FOOD.\\
135 - ROY, HE REALLY DOESN'T
LIKE TO TALK\\
136 - ABOUT
HIS DEATH-A-FOOD-A-SPREAD-ITIS.\\
137 - DEATH-A-FOOD-A-SPREADA WHAT?
WHO ARE YOU, ELMER FUDD?\\
138 - ALL RIGHT, FINE. HE
DOESN'T HAVE A DISEASE.\\
139 - I JUST... I REALLY
WANT THE JOB, ROY.\\
140 - WELL, I WISH I COULD
GIVE IT TO BOTH OF YOU.\\
141 - ERIC'S GOT THAT ZIPPY
PERSONALITY, AND KELSO'S ALL MAN.\\
142 - I KNOW WHAT
WE SHOULD DO.\\
143 - WE SHOULD MAKE IT
A COMPETITION.\\
144 - THAT WAY, THERE'S THE
FUN OF SOMEONE LOSING.\\
145 - j&j&j&\\
146 - OKAY, EVERYBODY, LET'S PUT
SOME SMILES ON THOSE FACES.\\
147 - WE'RE GOING TO GET DIVORCED.\\
148 - WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?\\
149 - LOOKS LIKE A BOX.\\
150 - I KNOW IT'S A BOX.\\
151 - HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE ATTITUDE?
I'M JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.\\
152 - LOOKS LIKE A BOX.
IT IS A BOX.\\
153 - THIS IS HOW
REAL PEOPLE TALK, MAN.\\
154 - OH, IT'S A PRESENT.\\
155 - OH, IT'S A WEDDING
PRESENT FROM AUNT MARTHA!\\
156 - YOU TOLD HER
ABOUT THE MARRIAGE?\\
157 - WE AGREED NEVER TO SPEAK
OF THIS EVIL TO ANYONE.\\
158 - WELL, I HAD
TO TELL A FEW PEOPLE,\\
159 - BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE ABLE TO SAY,\\
160 - "LAURIE GOT MARRIED"
WITHOUT ADDING,\\
161 - "AND THE BABY
CAME EARLY."\\
162 - OOH, LOOK
AT THE PAPER SPARKLE.\\
163 - I WONDER WHAT IT IS.\\
164 - WELL, KEEP WONDERING, 'CAUSE
THIS PACKAGE IS GOING RIGHT BACK.\\
165 - BUT DADDY!\\
166 - BUT DADDY.\\
167 - NO, NO,
I AM JUST CURIOUS.\\
168 - AUNT MARTHA'S WELL-TO-DO,
SO YOU HAVE TO FIGURE\\
169 - IT'S A PRETTY NICE PRESENT.
DON'T YOU WANNA JUST PEEK?\\
170 - NO, I WANNA GO
TO THE COURTHOUSE.\\
171 - NOW GET MOVING.\\
172 - WHATEVER'S IN THIS PACKAGE
MIGHT MAKE YOU HAPPY\\
173 - FOR A DAY,\\
174 - BUT A DIVORCE IS A GIFT
THAT LASTS A LIFETIME.\\
175 - GUESS WHAT, GIRLS.\\
176 - I GOT FUDGE.\\
177 - FUDGE?\\
178 - WHAT A SURPRISE!\\
179 - WHO'S IT FROM?\\
180 - IT DOESN'T SAY,
BUT THERE'S A POEM.\\
181 - "ROSES ARE RED.
VIOLETS ARE BLUE.\\
182 - FUDGE IS SWEET.
HERE'S SOME FUDGE."\\
183 - WELL,
THEY RUSHED ME.\\
184 - I WONDER WHO IT'S FROM,\\
185 - 'CAUSE THIS SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE LIKES YOU.\\
186 - I HOPE IT'S A LADY.\\
187 - HELLO.\\
188 - OH, HI, JOANNE.\\
189 - IT'S JOANNE.\\
190 - REALLY?\\
191 - WELL, I THINK IT'S
A LITTLE LATE TO TALK\\
192 - ABOUT GETTING BACK
TOGETHER.\\
193 - TURNS OUT
I'M VERY DESIRABLE.\\
194 - SO I THINK
THIS IS GOOD-BYE.\\
195 - OH, AND I WANT MY
BARRY WHITE ALBUMS BACK\\
196 - AND MY BODY PAINTS.\\
197 - OH, MY GOD.\\
198 - I KNOW. THEY PAINTED
EACH OTHER! UGH!\\
199 - ERIC, YOU'RE FIRST.\\
200 - I'M GONNA TEST YOU ON THE
SKILLS EVERY WAITER SHOULD HAVE.\\
201 - ROY,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW\\
202 - THAT BECAUSE OF MY EXTENSIVE
BACKGROUND IN CRAFTS,\\
203 - I CAN FOLD A NAPKIN
INTO A ROSE, A SWAN\\
204 - AND THE RARELY SEEN
X-WING FIGHTER.\\
205 - COOL.\\
206 - OKAY, I'M GONNA PLACE
A DIFFICULT ORDER.\\
207 - AND YOU'LL RELAY IT TO STEVEN
IN THE KITCHEN. HERE GOES.\\
208 - I'LL HAVE THE SURF
AND TURF, NO SEAFOOD,\\
209 - MEAT... NICE AND PINK, MASHED
POTATOES NOT MASHED,\\
210 - SLICED INTO WEDGES
AND FRIED UP.\\
211 - OKAY, SO STEAK, MEDIUM
RARE AND FRENCH FRIES.\\
212 - OKAY, I'M GONNA NEED
A NUMBER 4, STILL KICKIN',\\
213 - HOLD THE GUPPY
AND SEND IT TO FRANCE.\\
214 - AND THAT IS HOW
YOU DO THAT.\\
215 - I'LL HAVE THE SURF
AND TURF, NO SEAFOOD,\\
216 - MEAT... NICE AND PINK, MASHED
POTATOES NOT MASHED,\\
217 - SLICED INTO WEDGES
AND FRIED UP.\\
218 - ONE CHEESEBURGER.\\
219 - IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT A WAITER CAN DEAL\\
220 - WITH DIFFICULT CUSTOMERS.\\
221 - STEVEN AND I ARE GONNA PLAY
A MARRIED COUPLE.\\
222 - I'M NOT SO INTO THIS,
ROY.\\
223 - EXCUSE ME,
WAITER. THIS WINE IS NO GOOD.\\
224 - IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY,\\
225 - AND I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.\\
226 - GOD KNOWS,\\
227 - IT'S HARD ENOUGH JUST
TO GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE.\\
228 - OH, I'M VERY SORRY,
MADAME.\\
229 - IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME TO BRING
YOU A COMPLIMENTARY BOTTLE\\
230 - OF OUR FINEST WINE,
I'D BE MOST OBLIGED.\\
231 - MOST OBLIGED.\\
232 - THAT'S SHAKESPEARE.\\
233 - WAITER, IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY,\\
234 - AND THIS WINE IS NO GOOD.\\
235 - HEY, YOU GOT A LOT MORE
PROBLEMS THAN THE WINE.\\
236 - YOU ARE
ONE UGLY BROAD.\\
237 - I DO NOT APPRECIATE
YOUR TONE.\\
238 - MY TONE? DUDE,
YOUR WIFE'S A BITCH.\\
239 - OKAY, WORK YOUR WAY
AROUND THE TABLES\\
240 - WITH A TRAY FULL OF DISHES
WITHOUT SPILLING\\
241 - OR DROPPING ANYTHING.\\
242 - AND FOR GOD'S SAKES,
WATCH OUT FOR THE BABY.\\
243 - GO!\\
244 - 10 BUCKS SAYS HIS SKINNY LITTLE
WRIST SNAPS UNDER THE WEIGHT.\\
245 - I'LL TAKE THAT BET.\\
246 - HE'S SCRAWNY, BUT
STRONG, LIKE THE VIET CONG.\\
247 - SO, LIKE, WHEN
DOES THIS TEST START?\\
248 - OH, WHAT'S THIS?\\
249 - ROY, I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE LEFT A $20 BILL\\
250 - TUCKED IN MY SLEEVE.\\
251 - I'M ALWAYS
LOSING STUFF.\\
252 - NO, ROY, THAT WAS...\\
253 - AND GO!\\
254 - HA HA HA!\\
255 - WELL, ERIC,
YOU'RE HIRED.\\
256 - OH, REALLY?\\
257 - ROY,
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM,\\
258 - A REALLY MEDIOCRE DREAM.\\
259 - j&j&j&\\
260 - ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,\\
261 - ONLY 12 SIGNATURES
TO THE END\\
262 - OF WHAT I LIKE TO CALL
"THE SHAME."\\
263 - IT'S STILL THERE,\\
264 - AND IT CALLS TO ME,\\
265 - LIKE A BOX WITH
SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS IN IT.\\
266 - THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A PRESENT
WRAPPED IN BEAUTIFUL PAPER.\\
267 - IT'S LIKE CARY GRANT
IN A TUXEDO.\\
268 - I JUST WANNA RIP IT OFF!\\
269 - DON'T TOUCH IT.\\
270 - I'M NOT.\\
271 - I'M SMELLING IT.\\
272 - OOH! WHAT DOES IT
SMELL LIKE?\\
273 - A BOX.\\
274 - I HOPE IT'S
A SEWING MACHINE.\\
275 - I HOPE IT'S A TV.\\
276 - I HOPE
IT'S A CHOCOLATE TV.\\
277 - THERE COULD BE
PERISHABLES IN THERE.\\
278 - OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IF IT'S A PUPPY?\\
279 - WE HAVE TO OPEN IT.\\
280 - I DON'T CARE
IF ERIC'S IN THERE.\\
281 - IT'S GOING BACK.\\
282 - NOW LET'S GET
THESE SIGNED.\\
283 - LOOK, RIGHT HERE.
PAPER'S RIPPED.\\
284 - OH, MY GOSH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.\\
285 - HMM. I SEE PART
OF A WORD. "MORE."\\
286 - AND UNDER THAT,
SOMETHING "CROW."\\
287 - "MORE CROW."
"MORE CROW."\\
288 - IT'S A KENMORE
MICROWAVE!\\
289 - I WIN! I WIN!\\
290 - j&j&j&\\
291 - HEY, HYDE,\\
292 - WHERE'S TABLE SEVEN'S
FISH?\\
293 - OH, I GOT THAT FOR YOU,
ERIC.\\
294 - HERE IS
YOUR FILET OF SOLE.\\
295 - BURN!\\
296 - ALL RIGHT, ERIC, HERE'S
THE PEA SOUP YOU ORDERED.\\
297 - YOU PEED IN THE SOUP,
DIDN'T YOU?\\
298 - NO, I'M DONE TRYING
TO SCREW YOU OVER.\\
299 - IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU GOT THE JOB.\\
300 - SOME PEOPLE ARE BUSBOYS,
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE WAITERS.\\
301 - AND I GUESS I'M
JUST AN EXTREMELY...\\
302 - HANDSOME BUSBOY.\\
303 - ROY...\\
304 - THAT EXTREMELY HANDSOME
BUSBOY\\
305 - JUST BROKE MY HEART.\\
306 - I REALLY DON'T THINK
HE PEED IN THE SOUP, ERIC.\\
307 - COULDN'T YOU FIND
ANOTHER WAITER JOB FOR HIM?\\
308 - HE NEEDS A BREAK.
HE'S GOT A BABY ON THE WAY.\\
309 - WELL, THERE MIGHT BE
A JOB OPENING UP\\
310 - 'CAUSE JEANIE SAID
SHE'D QUIT\\
311 - IF I DIDN'T STOP
ASKING HER OUT.\\
312 - COME ON. I'M NOT GONNA
STOP ASKING HER OUT.\\
313 - SO LOOK,\\
314 - IF I REALLY
WORK HARD WITH KELSO,\\
315 - YOU'LL GIVE HIM
ANOTHER TRYOUT?\\
316 - SURE.\\
317 - BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK
HE CAN HANDLE IT.\\
318 - AND MY STANDARDS FOR
FOOD SERVICE ARE REALLY LOW.\\
319 - I HAVEN'T WASHED
MY HANDS IN FOUR DAYS.\\
320 - DAD...\\
321 - TOO LATE.
I FINISHED IT.\\
322 - SO I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHO SENT ME THE FUDGE.\\
323 - AND I THOUGHT IT COULD BE
THE LADY AT THE PHARMACY,\\
324 - WHICH IS NICE BECAUSE
SHE'S SEEN MY PRESCRIPTIONS,\\
325 - SO WE CAN SKIP
THAT AWKWARD CONVERSATION.\\
326 - OR IT COULD BE
THE MAIL LADY.\\
327 - DAD, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.\\
328 - JACKIE AND I
SENT YOU THE FUDGE.\\
329 - WHAT?\\
330 - WELL, YOU SEEMED SO SAD, AND
WE WANTED TO CHEER YOU UP.\\
331 - BUT THEN, WE SCREWED UP
YOUR CHANCES\\
332 - FOR GETTING BACK
TOGETHER WITH JOANNE, SO...\\
333 - SO NOBODY LIKES ME.\\
334 - WE LIKE YOU.\\
335 - EH.\\
336 - WE'RE REALLY SORRY, DAD.\\
337 - I GUESS IT'S NOT SO BAD.\\
338 - I MEAN, I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT JOANNE ALL DAY.\\
339 - WELL, IF YOU WANT, WE CAN
ALL DO SOMETHING TODAY.\\
340 - I CAN TAKE YOU
TO THE MODEL TRAIN SHOP.\\
341 - SOME OF THE TINY TREES
IN PINCIOTTI TOWN\\
342 - ARE LOOKING
PRETTY RATTY.\\
343 - NO, I'M GONNA GO DOWN\\
344 - AND TALK TO THE GIRL
AT THE PHARMACY.\\
345 - SHE'S GOT A BETTER KEISTER
THAN THE MAIL LADY.\\
346 - YOU'D THINK,
WITH ALL THAT WALKING...\\
347 - HEY, GUESS YOU EITHER
GOT IT OR YOU DON'T.\\
348 - j&j&j&\\
349 - ERIC, GIVE IT UP. I'M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS.\\
350 - HEY.\\
351 - NOW THAT'S NOT
THE KELSO I KNOW.\\
352 - A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID YOU
COULDN'T FIT 73 CHERRY BOMBS\\
353 - INTO A TOILET,
AND WHO PROVED THEM WRONG?\\
354 - I DID.\\
355 - THAT'S RIGHT,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID\\
356 - YOU COULDN'T MAKE OUT WITH
BOTH OF THE ZIEGLER TWINS\\
357 - IN THE SAME NIGHT,
AND WHO PROVED THEM WRONG?\\
358 - I DID.\\
359 - AND I ALSO BRUSHED
THEIR MOM'S BOOB\\
360 - AT A BAKE SALE, SO
ACTUALLY, IT WAS A THREE-FER.\\
361 - EXACTLY. YOU ARE
MICHAEL KELSO, RIGHT?\\
362 - YOU MAKE
THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPEN.\\
363 - NOW COME ON.
LET'S DO THIS.\\
364 - OKAY, READY,\\
365 - GET SET...\\
366 - KELSO!\\
367 - WHAT?!\\
368 - GOOD LUCK.\\
369 - j&j&j&\\
370 - AHH,
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING.\\
371 - THE BIRDS ARE SINGING.
THE FLOWERS ARE BLOOMING.\\
372 - DIVORCE IS IN THE AIR.\\
373 - NOW LET'S FINISH THIS.\\
374 - RED, NO ONE WANTS TO GET
DIVORCED ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.\\
375 - OOH!
AND THAT'S BREAKFAST.\\
376 - YOU USED THE MICROWAVE.\\
377 - RED FORMAN, I FIRMLY
BELIEVE THAT GOD WANTS ME\\
378 - TO BAKE A POTATO
IN FOUR MINUTES.\\
379 - NO, GOD WANTS
THESE TWO DIVORCED\\
380 - AND ALL EVIDENCE
OF THEIR UNHOLY UNION\\
381 - OUT OF THIS HOUSE.\\
382 - WE GOT
ANOTHER PRESENT!\\
383 - NO, NO. DON'T OPEN IT
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT KEEPING IT.\\
384 - WHOA.\\
385 - LOOK AT THAT SAW!\\
386 - IT'S FROM BILLY SCHNEIDER
DOWN AT THE HARDWARE STORE.\\
387 - HE'S HAD A CRUSH ON ME
EVER SINCE\\
388 - I WENT LADDER SHOPPING
IN THAT MINISKIRT.\\
389 - OKAY,
JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR,\\
390 - IF YOU'RE BUYING ME A GIFT,
I WANT CANDY.\\
391 - FOR MY BIRTHDAY,\\
392 - CHRISTMAS,
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS... CANDY.\\
393 - CANDY!\\
394 - NOW YOU CAN HAVE THE SAW,
RED.\\
395 - NO, I...\\
396 - THAT WOULD BE,
UH, WRONG.\\
397 - WELL...\\
398 - IT WOULD BE WRONG
IF THEY WERE DIVORCED,\\
399 - BUT IF THEY STAYED MARRIED,\\
400 - SENDING THE GIFTS BACK
WOULD BE RUDE.\\
401 - YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT.\\
402 - BUT I WANT A DIVORCE.\\
403 - I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, HONEY.
WE'LL WAIT A MONTH.\\
404 - IF A RIDING MOWER HASN'T
SHOWN UP BY THEN, WE'LL TALK.\\
405 - OKAY, REMEMBER, BUDDY.\\
406 - THE TRAY IS LIKE A LADY.\\
407 - DANCE WITH HER.\\
408 - AND GO!\\
409 - I DID IT!\\
410 - CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU GOT THE JOB.\\
411 - OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL BROOKE.\\
412 - HEY, WELCOME TO THE
EXCLUSIVE RANKS OF WAITER\\
413 - AT A CRAPPY
HOTEL RESTAURANT.\\
414 - I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I DID IT.\\
415 - YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE GLUE HELD.\\
416 - YEAH,
SUPER GLUE KICKS ASS!\\
417 - YOU KNOW WHAT, KELSO?\\
418 - YOUR FIRST SHIFT
IS NOT GONNA GO WELL.\\
419 - OH, IT'S GONNA BE
A DISASTER.\\
420 - "WARNING. NEVER PUT METAL
IN THE MICROWAVE."\\
421 - THIS ISN'T METAL.
IT'S SOUP.\\
422 - MISS KITTY,
ERIC BROKE THE MICROWAVE!
\subsection {Episode 07: Christmas}
1 - So, you gotta work at the
radio station on Christmas Eve?\\
2 - God, it's like,
doesn't anyone respect\\
3 - the sanctity of that holy night?\\
4 - We were gonna get
drunk and fool around\\
5 - behind your dad's manger scene.\\
6 - But this is my first
shot at deejaying.\\
7 - If I do well, Hot Donna
could be the regular DJ\\
8 - on Tuesdays from
1:00 to 5:00 a.m.\\
9 - Every insomniac and burn-out
in town is gonna know who I am.\\
10 - Well, say hello to
your target audience.\\
11 - Play more Zeppelin.\\
12 - You guys, I've got
some terrible news.\\
13 - I've just been kicked off
the cheerleading squad.\\
14 - Oh, my gentle Jesus!
Oh, no!\\
15 - Oh, why?\\
16 - Jackie, I know how you feel. I
once got kicked off a cheerleader.\\
17 - Well, I need to get
back on that squad.\\
18 - They might be a bunch of
pom-pom waving bitches,\\
19 - but they're all I know.\\
20 - Steven, you've gotta take me to the
Christmas Eve dance tomorrow night.\\
21 - Uh, no.\\
22 - I can either dance with you or
spend Christmas Eve with you.\\
23 - Cannot do a combo.\\
24 - Steven, they will never take me
back if I don't show up all proud.\\
25 - If you could just see No.\\
26 - That this is something that's
really important to me, No.\\
27 - Then you'd understand that,
as my boyfriend, you should go.\\
28 - No!
Fine.\\
29 - Please?\\
30 - Fine.
Okay.\\
31 - Hey, shut up.\\
32 - If I'm going,
you guys are coming with me.\\
33 - Oh, no. I cannot go
to a high-school dance.\\
34 - I'm gonna be a father soon, I
gotta start acting more mature.\\
35 - All right, orange!\\
36 - Yeah, I'm not going either.\\
37 - The football team and I have
a little disagreement.\\
38 - They think it's funny
to stuff me into a locker,\\
39 - and I disagree.\\
40 - Yeah, man, the day I
graduated, I promised myself\\
41 - I would never set foot in
that godforsaken place again.\\
42 - Great news, kids.\\
43 - Red's gonna be the Santa down
at the mall on Christmas Eve,\\
44 - and I've signed you all up
to be his little helpers.\\
45 - Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.\\
46 - We're all going to the
Christmas Eve dance at school.\\
47 - Yeah!\\
48 - Hanging out\\
49 - Down the street\\
50 - The same old thing\\
51 - We did last week\\
52 - Not a thing to do\\
53 - But talk to you\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - We're all all right\\
56 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
57 - Don't go away, kids,\\
58 - A Year Without A Santa Claus
will be right back.\\
59 - Man, Heat Miser's badass.\\
60 - So, what time are you coming
down to the station tonight?\\
61 - Let's see, the Christmas
dance starts at 8:00,\\
62 - so I'll just come as
soon as it gets lame.\\
63 - Say, uh, 8:02.\\
64 - Yeah. Hey, you know what?\\
65 - I'll even bring you
something sweet to munch on.\\
66 - Oh, and some cookies.\\
67 - What? Oh, what?\\
68 - Okay, now, please...\\
69 - Stand still.\\
70 - Nobody likes a Santa
with plumber's butt.\\
71 - Why am I doing this?\\
72 - Because I wanna
force some good cheer\\
73 - through your clogged arteries
and into your cranky heart.\\
74 - Yeah, it's like Christmas Drano.\\
75 - I can't believe you're
replacing me as Santa, Red.\\
76 - Three years and now
management says I'm too jolly.\\
77 - What do you want, Bob?\\
78 - I want to be Santa.\\
79 - Well, it's Red's turn this year.\\
80 - Santa could use an elf.\\
81 - Fine, but I don't wanna sit in the
back and pretend to assemble toys.\\
82 - I want to participate.\\
83 - Yeah, Bob,
you gotta keep your dignity.\\
84 - If you're in an elf costume,\\
85 - you don't want that tiny
hammer making you look silly.\\
86 - Steven, for the
Christmas Eve dance... No.\\
87 - What do you think
about this tie? No.\\
88 - Maybe this jacket...
No.\\
89 - How about a blazer?
No.\\
90 - Fine... Bolo?\\
91 - Fine.
Okay.\\
92 - Okay, Brooke,
I made a list of reasons\\
93 - why I'm gonna make a
great dad for our little baby.\\
94 - Okay, number one, I am a waiter.\\
95 - So we'll never
run out of straws.\\
96 - See? Look,
kids love straws.\\
97 - Michael, I really appreciate
the gesture, but no thanks.\\
98 - Seriously,
I think if we just hang out,\\
99 - you'll see that I'm getting
a lot more mature.\\
100 - I mean, just the other day
I watched golf and took a nap.\\
101 - Look, Michael, if we
weren't in this situation,\\
102 - I think you'd be
a really good friend.\\
103 - I mean, you're nice,
you bring me stuff,\\
104 - dogs love you.\\
105 - I just think we should limit
our time together to\\
106 - almost none.\\
107 - Okay, how about we make a
compromise between "almost none"\\
108 - and what I want to do,
which is "it"?\\
109 - Okay, if you want, you can
help me hang decorations tonight\\
110 - for the library's
Christmas party.\\
111 - Spend Christmas
Eve in a library?\\
112 - Why don't you just
kick me in the 'nads?\\
113 - Okay, here comes Julie,
the head cheerleader.\\
114 - Now, Steven, make me look good.\\
115 - Hello, Jackie.\\
116 - Hello, Julie.\\
117 - This is my boyfriend,
Steven J. Hyde III.\\
118 - First two are in jail.\\
119 - He pretends to be poor.
Isn't that funny?\\
120 - I have to say, I thought
you'd be too embarrassed\\
121 - to show your face here tonight.\\
122 - Well, to be honest, I only
came to see your outfit,\\
123 - so I'd know what not to wear.\\
124 - Well, let me show you the back.\\
125 - If you're trying to get back
on the cheerleading squad,\\
126 - shouldn't you be nice to her?\\
127 - Bitchiness is the only language
cheerleaders understand.\\
128 - These are bad girls,\\
129 - they need to be punished,
and they know it.\\
130 - Yeah, this is way better than
hanging out at the library with Brooke.\\
131 - Lot of great memories in here.\\
132 - Did it in there.\\
133 - Did it back there.\\
134 - Got caught by Miss Tompkins
doing it down there.\\
135 - Did it with Miss
Tompkins over there.\\
136 - Everyone, look for
football players.\\
137 - I cannot spend another
holiday in a locker.\\
138 - And this time, if I don't
show up for two days,\\
139 - come look for me.\\
140 - Oh, my God!
Eric Forman?\\
141 - You look great,
I love your shirt.\\
142 - Really?\\
143 - I wore this shirt for four
years, and no one said a thing.\\
144 - I guess now you
really fill it out.\\
145 - Thanks.\\
146 - I'm, like, up to 17
push-ups a night so...\\
147 - No, I don't think that's it.\\
148 - I think it's because you're
not a high-school boy anymore.\\
149 - Yeah, you're 18 now.\\
150 - You've seen and done it all.\\
151 - No, no, I...\\
152 - Yes.\\
153 - Yes, I have.\\
154 - Hey, you need to watch out,
okay? Girls are talking to you.\\
155 - I think there might be
a practical joke in the works.\\
156 - No, man, I don't think so.\\
157 - I think it's 'cause I graduated.\\
158 - Hyde, am I cool now?\\
159 - Well, you're cool
like margarine is butter.\\
160 - Close, but there's
a little aftertaste.\\
161 - Women to the left of me\\
162 - And women to the right\\
163 - Ain't got no gun\\
164 - Ain't got no knife\\
165 - Don't you start no fight\\
166 - 'Cause I'm T.N.T.,
I'm dynamite\\
167 - T.N.T.
and I'll win the fight\\
168 - T.N.T. I'm a power load\\
169 - T.N.T. watch me explode\\
170 - I'm dirty,
mean and mighty unclean\\
171 - You're in the middle of
a Christmas Eve rock block\\
172 - on WFPP with me, Hot Donna.\\
173 - That was bacon.\\
174 - I recorded that
myself earlier today.\\
175 - Stay tuned for more Christmas
classics with me, Hot Donna.\\
176 - I'm sorry,
but that is just too cool.\\
177 - Okay, Mr Claus,\\
178 - let's hear your
best Santa laugh.\\
179 - Ho, ho.\\
180 - You left out a "ho", Red.\\
181 - It's three "ho's". Did you
even read the Santa manual?\\
182 - Okay, Red, I'm sure
you'll do fine.\\
183 - Just remember, Santa
is a cheerful, jolly fellow,\\
184 - who never calls
a child "dumbass".\\
185 - So, what do you
want for Christmas?\\
186 - I want a slinky.\\
187 - A slinky? Oh, you'll get
sick of a slinky in a day.\\
188 - I'm putting you
down for flash cards.\\
189 - Math, that's what you're
getting for Christmas.\\
190 - Next.\\
191 - I want a pony.\\
192 - Ponies die.\\
193 - What you need is
a good pair of boots.\\
194 - Go on, keep it moving.\\
195 - I want a flying car.\\
196 - I did, too,
when I was your age, kid.\\
197 - But then the future came
and took my dreams away.\\
198 - Just like it's gonna take yours.\\
199 - Okay, okay, little
girl, you know what?\\
200 - I bet, if you're extra good,
you'll get your flying car one day.\\
201 - Don't listen to her.
It's a lie.\\
202 - Bad Santa.\\
203 - Yep, life after
graduation sure is sweet.\\
204 - Some days I wake
up and I'm like,\\
205 - "Hey, I'm having
ice-cream for breakfast."\\
206 - And you know what? I do.\\
207 - Wow!\\
208 - So, what have you two
been up to since graduation?\\
209 - She talked to me.
What do I do?\\
210 - Yeah, I got
a librarian pregnant.\\
211 - Damn! Good answer!\\
212 - So, like, Eric, what are
your plans for the future?\\
213 - Well, I guess I'm just gonna
keep on keeping on, you know?\\
214 - I'm thinking
about buying a boat.\\
215 - Okay, we're back, and if
my boyfriend's listening,\\
216 - you're late and
I'm a little worried\\
217 - you're trapped in a
snowdrift or something.\\
218 - So, honey, if you're cold,
I'm with you, baby.\\
219 - Okay, so let's
take some requests.\\
220 - Hello, you're on the air.\\
221 - Hi, I'd like to dedicate He's
the Greatest Dancer by Sister Sledge\\
222 - to Eric Forman, the coolest
guy at the Christmas dance.\\
223 - What? He's still at the dance?\\
224 - Sorry, I have to go. He's
telling us about his boat.\\
225 - That sneaky bastard.\\
226 - That sneaky bastard,
Santa Claus, is on his way\\
227 - with a non-stop block
of classic Christmas tunes.\\
228 - And remember, you're listening
to WFPP, with me, Hot Donna.\\
229 - You hear that, Eric Forman?\\
230 - That's not bacon, that's your
ass when I get a hold of you.\\
231 - Hey, I brought you
something sweet to munch on.\\
232 - Oh! And some cookies.\\
233 - Man, I knew that was funny.\\
234 - Man, I can't stop
thinking about Brooke.\\
235 - I mean, both you and me know
that every girl in here wants me,\\
236 - except for the couple of
weirdoes that seem to want you,\\
237 - but I don't care
about any of them.\\
238 - Look, Kelso, are you sure you
don't just have a crush on Brooke\\
239 - because she's a librarian,\\
240 - and you've seen some
librarian layout in Playboy?\\
241 - Eric, I'm sure
that's part of it.\\
242 - Whatever.
I'm going to the library.\\
243 - Whoa, that felt weird to say.\\
244 - Steven, you don't look like
you're having a good time.\\
245 - I'm not.\\
246 - I know, but I need
you to act like you are.\\
247 - Just think about
stuff you enjoy,\\
248 - like shoplifting or dirty jeans.\\
249 - Jackie, how come you never told
me you were dating an older man?\\
250 - Well, I guess I was
just distracted\\
251 - by the life I lead
outside of cheerleading,\\
252 - where I do fun and
glamorous things,\\
253 - with my older,
mysterious boyfriend.\\
254 - That's true.
Why, just last week,\\
255 - we sat on the couch
and had a fight.\\
256 - I'm jealous.\\
257 - This dance sucks.\\
258 - None of the girls remember me.
They all think I'm a waiter.\\
259 - Hey, I got an idea how you can
get these girls' attention.\\
260 - Oh, boy, does it involve me
hiding in the girls' bathroom?\\
261 - No.\\
262 - Okay, we'll try your way.\\
263 - And that's what really
happened in Vietnam.\\
264 - I don't understand.\\
265 - Neither do I, kid.
Neither do I.\\
266 - Okay, little boy, time to
say goodbye to Santa.\\
267 - What's an ambush?\\
268 - It's a pretty bush
with yellow flowers.\\
269 - Kitty, I gotta tell you,
I'm good with kids.\\
270 - I really taught him something.\\
271 - You know, I think I'm beginning
to feel the Christmas spirit.\\
272 - Well, I'm glad, Red.\\
273 - But let's try
telling a Christmas story\\
274 - where nobody gets
caught in a firefight.\\
275 - Bob, what the hell
are you doing?\\
276 - You're depressing the kids.
I'm Santa now.\\
277 - Get out of my chair, Bob,\\
278 - or you're gonna get a
candy cane up your chimney.\\
279 - I'm not moving.\\
280 - Kitty, hold my silly red hat.\\
281 - You're right, I really am funny.\\
282 - What do you think you're
doing? Eric, you never showed up.\\
283 - I was worried about you.\\
284 - Well, I'm sorry, I guess
I lost track of time.\\
285 - Maybe it's because
I am a god to these people.\\
286 - Donna, they like this shirt.\\
287 - This is a horrible shirt.\\
288 - I gave you that shirt.\\
289 - I know. I love this shirt.\\
290 - Eric, I can't believe you let
yourself get a swelled head\\
291 - just because a couple of
high-school kids think you're cool.\\
292 - Excuse me, aren't you Hot Donna?\\
293 - You were so awesome
on the radio today.\\
294 - You really think?\\
295 - Wait, what's going on?\\
296 - I think we're in for a treat.\\
297 - I'll have a blue Christmas\\
298 - Nice decorations.\\
299 - I see you're using one
of the better-tasting glues.\\
300 - What are you doing here?\\
301 - Oh, I just thought,
instead of having\\
302 - a fun Christmas
Eve somewhere else,\\
303 - I'd rather have
a boring one here with you.\\
304 - But we could have some fun.\\
305 - Michael, I've told you before,\\
306 - just because you come
to the library after hours,\\
307 - does not mean I'm gonna
walk around topless.\\
308 - But it's Christmas.\\
309 - Oh, here let me help you
with the decorations.\\
310 - Pregnant women should not
be standing on their tiptoes,\\
311 - 'cause the baby will
come out all cross-eyed.\\
312 - Listen, if you think you're
gonna get me interested in you\\
313 - by being cute and
making me laugh...\\
314 - Well, it's probably gonna work.\\
315 - But if you screw this up,\\
316 - I am gonna ruin your credit with
thousands of dollars in library fines.\\
317 - Fair enough.\\
318 - Well, what say we seal
this newfound friendship\\
319 - with a round of topless
ornament hanging?\\
320 - Okay, fine!
Whatever you wanna do.\\
321 - Topless.\\
322 - This mall is only big
enough for one Santa, Bob.\\
323 - Tell you what, you name
five reindeer and I'll step down.\\
324 - I can name five toes that
are gonna be in your ass.\\
325 - Oh, for goodness' sake!\\
326 - Why don't we stop calling it
Christmas and call it "Assmas"?\\
327 - Fine, I'll go.\\
328 - I only got worked up because
Joanne's gone, Donna's working.\\
329 - The only people I have at home
are my two friends, Egg and Nog.\\
330 - All right, fine.\\
331 - You wanna be Santa, go ahead.\\
332 - Thanks, Red.\\
333 - Yeah, it's all for the best.\\
334 - I've already eaten about two
pounds of fake beard as it is.\\
335 - There he is. Santa's the one who
told me that communists hate God.\\
336 - Gotta go, Santa.\\
337 - Merry Christmas, Bob.
Mrs Claus needs a drink.\\
338 - And then I push a button,
and it sounds like bacon.\\
339 - This is so awesome.
We're like a celebrity couple.\\
340 - It's intoxicating.\\
341 - Donna, it is a heady brew.\\
342 - Hey, let's go drink beer
in front of some sophomores.\\
343 - Jackie, in light of you showing
up tonight with your boyfriend,\\
344 - who, by the way, is
totally cool and a fox...\\
345 - Big newsflash there.\\
346 - ...I'd like to invite you
to rejoin the cheer squad.\\
347 - Really?
Yeah.\\
348 - Huh.\\
349 - You know, I don't think I wanna
be a cheerleader anymore.\\
350 - But we hugged and jumped.\\
351 - Well, I'm gonna have to
take back that hug and jump\\
352 - with a pout and a shrug.\\
353 - Are you telling me I came
to this hellhole for nothing?\\
354 - No, not for nothing, Steven.\\
355 - I realize these girls
aren't my friends anymore.\\
356 - I learned something
about myself.\\
357 - Oh, well, isn't that...\\
358 - Okay, well, if it makes you feel
any better, I get to keep the uniform.\\
359 - Yeah, that helps.
Yeah.\\
360 - You set me up! "Sing a
song, they'll all love you."\\
361 - Well, I'm gonna spend
Christmas in a locker.\\
362 - Oh, crap, I'm still on the air!\\
363 - Jigsaw puzzle.\\
364 - Baseball glove.\\
365 - Barbie doll tea set.\\
366 - Wow, you're good at this.\\
367 - Yeah, I've had
a little practice.\\
368 - Ant farm.\\
369 - It's a Lone Ranger cap gun set.
\subsection {Episode 08: I'm a Boy}
1 - - Good morning.
- Try, "Good 1:30."\\
2 - I'm just so worn out from
carrying around all this tip money.\\
3 - There you go, Mom.\\
4 - Why don't you kick up the
thermostat a couple of degrees on me?\\
5 - Well, thank you, honey.\\
6 - And you have been
such a big help,\\
7 - working yourself
nearly to death,\\
8 - I made you
your special sandwich.\\
9 - Oh.\\
10 - The Eric McSweetie.\\
11 - It's a regular sandwich.
Hold the masculinity.\\
12 - Oop, oop, oop.\\
13 - It's almost time for Red's doctor's
appointment. Have to iron his underwear.\\
14 - No crust? Check. Extra jelly?
Check. My mommy loves me? Check.\\
15 - Eric, wow, you look beat.\\
16 - Yeah, I was working
until, like, 1:00 last night.\\
17 - My poor baby. I know
something that'll cheer you up.\\
18 - Today, I got my first
bridal magazine.\\
19 - We can spend the whole
afternoon talking about wedding stuff.\\
20 - Like the groomsmen
can wear kilts.\\
21 - Donna, you know how much
I'd love to spend\\
22 - four or five hours talking
about the wedding,\\
23 - or clothes, or clothes
for the wedding,\\
24 - but, God, I'm so beat
from last night.\\
25 - Okay, well, why don't you
go back to bed\\
26 - and I'll crawl in
with you after class?\\
27 - But this time,
sweep the bed for G.I. Joes,\\
28 - 'cause that last thing that
happened, that was unpleasant.\\
29 - Life is a cabaret, my friend.\\
30 - We didn't work until 1:00. We
got off at 10:00 and played poker.\\
31 - Hyde, let's not weigh ourselves
down with the truth here.\\
32 - When I started
working full-time,\\
33 - I thought that my life
was gonna be a total grind,\\
34 - but my mom, Donna,
they can't do enough for me.\\
35 - Look at this. Heart shaped sandwiches.
Donna's giving me sexy naps.\\
36 - As God as my witness, I will
never go hungry or horny again.\\
37 - Will you please wear
the ironed underwear?\\
38 - I have a reputation to protect.\\
39 - Eric, you're driving me to my doctor's
appointment. Please put on pants.\\
40 - Eric is a little tired
from working so late,\\
41 - so I found someone else
to drive you.\\
42 - Jump in, Smokey.
Bandit's on the move.\\
43 - Hanging out\\
44 - Down the street\\
45 - The same old thing\\
46 - We did last week\\
47 - Not a thing to do\\
48 - But talk to you\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
52 - Okay, Brooke, here's the thing.\\
53 - We should date.\\
54 - Michael, I'm pregnant
with your child.\\
55 - Pretty much the best
and worst things\\
56 - about dating have already
happened to us.\\
57 - Okay, but we missed out
on all the in-between, like...\\
58 - Okay, we need to spice up\\
59 - our illegitimate pregnancy
with a little romance.\\
60 - I mean, look how much
we have in common.\\
61 - You are having my baby\\
62 - and I am the father
of your baby.\\
63 - Okay, look, don't pretend
you wanna go out with me\\
64 - just because you feel guilty.\\
65 - Brooke, I wanna go out
with you because you're hot.\\
66 - Okay, fine. But I'm not hot.
I've gained six pounds.\\
67 - That's okay 'cause it's
mostly in your boobs.\\
68 - See, nature does this to keep
us guys around\\
69 - while you gals chunk out.\\
70 - Okay, let's get a couple
of things straight.\\
71 - I don't wanna be here.
You don't wanna be here.\\
72 - I want to be here.\\
73 - Fine. I don't wanna be here\\
74 - and I don't care what you want.\\
75 - - Okay, then,
are you buckled up?
- Yes.\\
76 - Because the little blinking man
on the dashboard says you aren't.\\
77 - Buckle up.\\
78 - - No.
- Yes.\\
79 - No. Look, start this car or
I'm gonna pack you in a crate,\\
80 - take you down to the port, and trade
you for a year's supply of bananas.\\
81 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
82 - You awake?\\
83 - Well, if I were asleep,
there would be six of you\\
84 - all making out
with yourselves, so...\\
85 - I can't believe how late
you have to stay\\
86 - at the restaurant.\\
87 - Well, you know that grated
cheese you like so much?\\
88 - Gets grated the night before.\\
89 - Yeah, little thing we like
to call "prep," so...\\
90 - I love it when you
use restaurant talk.\\
91 - Donna, I have to warn you,
I'm exhausted,\\
92 - so you're gonna have
to do all the work.\\
93 - Why should today
be any different?\\
94 - Okay.\\
95 - I need to know what to do
on a first date\\
96 - with a woman
who's carrying my child.\\
97 - Hold her while she weeps.\\
98 - Hey, wait, what if you guys came
to dinner with me and Brooke?\\
99 - - Make it easier to find
stuff to talk about.
- No.\\
100 - No, man. There's no way
I'm going on a date\\
101 - with your ex-girlfriend who is now
my girlfriend, and your new girlfriend\\
102 - who doesn't want
to be your girlfriend\\
103 - but is pregnant with your child.\\
104 - It's like hillbilly territory.\\
105 - - I'll pay.
- I'm in.\\
106 - Well, then, I have to go
find something to wear.\\
107 - I mean, I'm happy that Brooke's
gonna have a father for her baby and all,\\
108 - but I still have to look
prettier than her.\\
109 - Well, I was woken\\
110 - from my afternoon nap
by my girlfriend\\
111 - for some afternoon delight.\\
112 - After which, I took another
afternoon nap.\\
113 - You know what I have
right in the palm of my hand?\\
114 - No one wants to know that.
Just wash up.\\
115 - The secret of life.\\
116 - You know what? I'm taking
this one step further, fellas.\\
117 - I'm gonna get fat.\\
118 - Yeah, I'll never be strong,\\
119 - but I think I can be fat.\\
120 - That's a pretty thought.\\
121 - Come on, Fez,
don't be scared. Go say hi.\\
122 - No, he's too fat.\\
123 - I don't know where his face is.\\
124 - He can't eat you.
He can't even move. Watch.\\
125 - That tickles.\\
126 - Something's poking me.\\
127 - G.I. Joe! There you are.\\
128 - Wonder what else is in there.\\
129 - - Kelso!
- Kelso!\\
130 - - I thought you moved away.
- I've been living on crumbs.\\
131 - All right, okay, laugh
all you want. But all I see\\
132 - is a guy who doesn't have to get
out of bed to go to the bathroom.\\
133 - And that's beautiful.\\
134 - Hey, look, there's the
Elks lodge. Pull over.\\
135 - But I thought we would
celebrate the good checkup.\\
136 - There's this pie
down at the coffee shop\\
137 - I've been flirting with
for days.\\
138 - How about this
for a celebration?\\
139 - I'm going in there
with my buddies\\
140 - and you wait in the car.\\
141 - But that doesn't sound like fun.\\
142 - Well, that's how
we celebrate in America.\\
143 - Okay, let's head for home.\\
144 - - So, now you're not
gonna talk?
- Why should I talk?\\
145 - My feelings are obviously
of no consequence to you.\\
146 - All right, maybe I stayed a
little longer than I expected.\\
147 - Hey, look, how about
we stop for some pie?\\
148 - - No.
- Oh, come on. Let me get you a pie.\\
149 - I am not in the mood.\\
150 - Oh, just let me buy you...\\
151 - There will be no pie!\\
152 - Wow, good pot.\\
153 - There's gotta be like
four or five bucks in there.\\
154 - Yeah, you guys are going
down. I got a full house.\\
155 - I mean,\\
156 - what do I got?\\
157 - Why don't we bet a lot and see?\\
158 - Kelso, I know you think
you got a full house,\\
159 - but you're only
holding two cards.\\
160 - So I'll raise.\\
161 - This is great. It's 1:00 in
the morning, I'm not alone,\\
162 - and I'm not alone.
This is great.\\
163 - Guys, I don't want to brag.\\
164 - My belt's getting pretty tight.\\
165 - I think Operation Fat Eric
is well underway.\\
166 - What the hell are you doing?\\
167 - - Donna.
- You told me
you were working.\\
168 - I brought you brownies because you
told me you were working your ass off.\\
169 - And now it turns out that
you're spending all the time\\
170 - we could have spent together
with the guys.\\
171 - And I gave you daytime sex.\\
172 - All right!
Who brought brownies?\\
173 - Is Eric upstairs?\\
174 - Just look for the lump under
the covers sucking its thumb.\\
175 - - Hey, you gonna yell?
- No, I'm past yelling.\\
176 - - What's past yelling?
- It's the dark side
of the moon, my friend.\\
177 - It's a place so ugly,
if it was a woman,\\
178 - even you wouldn't
have sex with her.\\
179 - That's bad.\\
180 - How can you sleep until noon
after what happened last night?\\
181 - I'm exhausted from
loving you so much.\\
182 - You're completely regressing.\\
183 - You lie around all day
and you act\\
184 - as if you'd be happy to stay
in your mother's house forever.\\
185 - Look, Donna, let me
make it up to you.\\
186 - There's some tip money
on the dresser.\\
187 - Why don't you go
buy yourself something pretty?\\
188 - - Oh, God!
- That's gotta hurt!\\
189 - Don't worry.
We can still hear.\\
190 - Eric, what is happening to you?\\
191 - Look, Donna, I'm sorry,
but I'm not regressing.\\
192 - You gotta understand, I'm
the man of this house now.\\
193 - Okay, who's ready
for Spidey and a sandwich?\\
194 - Me!\\
195 - Mrs. Forman, your son
is a big, lazy child\\
196 - because you keep babying him.\\
197 - I don't baby him.\\
198 - Is there crust on that sandwich?\\
199 - Well, of course not.\\
200 - Crusts are icky.
They make Eric sicky.\\
201 - Oh, my God, I'm ruining him.\\
202 - Eric, things are going to\\
203 - change around here, drastically.\\
204 - Tomorrow, you are getting
a sandwich with the crusts on.\\
205 - And no more crazy straws.\\
206 - You will be drinking
your chocolate milk\\
207 - from a standard straw.\\
208 - Now, who's hungry?\\
209 - -I call sandwich
-I call Spidey.\\
210 - I call sandwich
you haven't made yet.\\
211 - Okay, Donna,\\
212 - - I get it. I'm sorry.
- No, that's not gonna cut it.\\
213 - I've been wearing this engagement
ring so long, it's white under there,\\
214 - and a little wrinkly.\\
215 - You haven't brought up
the wedding in weeks.\\
216 - I stayed home from college
to be with you,\\
217 - and if I knew you were gonna
act like this, I would have gone.\\
218 - - You're right.
- I know.\\
219 - Donna, I know that I'm lucky
to be with you.\\
220 - Hell, when we go out together,
people think I'm your little brother.\\
221 - That's true. They say I
shouldn't have you out so late.\\
222 - You're right. No, you are
absolutely right.\\
223 - And I'm really,
really sorry, okay?\\
224 - So, are you still mad at me?\\
225 - Well, it's kind of hard when
you keep agreeing with me.\\
226 - - I agree.
- Stop it.\\
227 - - You're beautiful.
- I will kick your ass.\\
228 - So, hey, maybe a good way
to break the ice\\
229 - would be for everyone to tell
a few things about themselves.\\
230 - I'll go first.\\
231 - I like make-up and diets,\\
232 - and Steven, here, likes black
things and throwing stuff at glass.\\
233 - Okay. Well, I was
valedictorian of my class,\\
234 - I run marathons,
and I tutor kids in Latin.\\
235 - Well, I egged
the valedictorian of my class\\
236 - and a marathon runner
and some kids that took Latin.\\
237 - This is fun.\\
238 - So, how do you guys
all know each other?\\
239 - Well, Michael and I dated
for, like, three years.\\
240 - Then I stole her from him.\\
241 - Wait. What?\\
242 - You never could have
stole her from me\\
243 - if I hadn't cheated
on her first.\\
244 - Okay, wait a minute.\\
245 - That sounds a lot worse
than what it is.\\
246 - I only cheated on her
with Eric's sister.\\
247 - Well, and then the rest of the
girls were when we were on a break\\
248 - 'cause I annoyed her.\\
249 - But none of those girls
were anybody's sister,\\
250 - except for the two
that were sisters.\\
251 - He brought up the sisters.\\
252 - Awesome.\\
253 - Okay, this was a mistake.
I think I'm gonna go.\\
254 - No. Brooke, wait. Look...\\
255 - I've been with a lot
of chicks. A lot.\\
256 - A lot.\\
257 - A lot.\\
258 - Okay, that's not helping.\\
259 - Okay, Brooke,
let me start over, okay?\\
260 - We might not be the perfect match,
okay? But I really, really like you.\\
261 - And I think maybe us having
this baby together is like\\
262 - fate.\\
263 - Michael, fate is when two
people meet on a train or in Paris,\\
264 - not in the bathroom
at a Molly Hatchet concert.\\
265 - Fate!\\
266 - Man, never use a word in a fight\\
267 - if you don't really,
really know what it means.\\
268 - Still not speaking to me, huh?\\
269 - Fine, I'll speak.\\
270 - I spent all day running your
bald, grumpy ass around town\\
271 - and do I get a thanks? No.\\
272 - Because you're unpleasant.\\
273 - You wanna know
why I'm unpleasant?\\
274 - I just had a heart attack\\
275 - and now I have to be driven
around like a useless dope\\
276 - by the idiot
that married my daughter\\
277 - and gave me the heart attack
in the first place.\\
278 - But I am also unpleasant\\
279 - because I just spent the
entire day cooped up in the car\\
280 - breathing that mustard gas
you call cologne.\\
281 - But mostly, I'm unpleasant because
that's how it works in this family.\\
282 - I'm family?\\
283 - Oh, crap.\\
284 - Guys, everything
is totally cool.\\
285 - I promise to stop acting
like such an ass\\
286 - and give Donna
only presents, not cash.\\
287 - And why is that?\\
288 - Because presents are for
girlfriends and cash is for hookers.\\
289 - - Although...
- You're so good,
I should pay you.\\
290 - Thank you.\\
291 - You should have
seen it coming, Forman.\\
292 - 'Cause when you are deeply,
truly happy,\\
293 - it's a sure sign
you're doing everything wrong.\\
294 - It's true.
When Steven's unhappy,\\
295 - I know our relationship
is in good shape.\\
296 - Well, then, we've been tip-top
since the minute I met you.\\
297 - Aw.\\
298 - Yeah, I couldn't be unhappier
about me and Brooke,\\
299 - so I know I'm doing
the right thing,\\
300 - 'cause the misery is how God
lets you know you're on track.\\
301 - And how. Red and I
are miserable together\\
302 - and that crazy bastard
is nuts about me.\\
303 - Donna, what are you doing
the day after your birthday?\\
304 - Nursing a hangover.\\
305 - You might wanna stick to
light beer, 'cause I was thinking\\
306 - maybe we could
get married that day.\\
307 - Oh, my God,
are you setting a date?\\
308 - You can't set a date
in the circle.\\
309 - I can and I did.\\
310 - I love you.\\
311 - There's no groping
in the circle.\\
312 - We made that rule for Fez
but it goes for everyone.\\
313 - Oh, come on, Eric, take charge.\\
314 - Grab her like you mean it.
I'll do it.\\
315 - - Brooke.
- Holy crap.\\
316 - That's the girl
you got pregnant?\\
317 - She's hot.\\
318 - Do you think we could
talk alone for a minute?\\
319 - Sure, I'll go, but just know, if
it doesn't work out with him,\\
320 - I've got dental
for all dependents.\\
321 - - You're funny.
- I love you.\\
322 - Bye. Got, you know,
things to do.\\
323 - Look, I don't know why
what happened happened.\\
324 - I mean, it could have been fate.\\
325 - It could have been the Colt 45s.\\
326 - But I do know
you're being very sweet\\
327 - and I could probably use a hand,\\
328 - 'cause, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of scared.\\
329 - That's perfect,
'cause I'm terrified.\\
330 - I know. I mean, it's crazy.\\
331 - - We're having a baby!
- I know!\\
332 - - And we have no clue!
- None at all!\\
333 - All right, so,
can I call you tomorrow?\\
334 - Yes.\\
335 - Before you go, I just
wanted to say I don't love you.\\
336 - I just kind of get nervous
in front of women.\\
337 - I blurt.\\
338 - I understand.
I think it's very sweet.\\
339 - I love you.\\
340 - What is wrong with me?\\
341 - "Hi, Roy." "Hello, Brooke."\\
342 - "Hi, Roy." "Hello, Brooke."\\
343 - "Hi, Roy." "Hello, Brooke."\\
344 - I got this.\\
345 - - Hi, Roy.
- I love you.\\
346 - Excuse me.\\
347 - - Roy, that's the freezer.
- I know.
\subsection {Episode 09: Young Man Blues}
1 - Hey, check it out, guys,
it's Sergeant Crossing Guard.\\
2 - Rough day
on the crosswalk, Sarge?\\
3 - I'm not a crossing guard, Hyde,\\
4 - I'm a police officer
in training.\\
5 - - Read the badge.
- You mean your paper nametag?\\
6 - No, I mean my badge.\\
7 - This symbolizes
all the authority\\
8 - of the Point Place
police department.\\
9 - How'd it get ripped?\\
10 - Hey! Your first case.\\
11 - Get this. Tomorrow I get to go
on a ride-along in a real police car.\\
12 - I get to see
all the crime as it happens.\\
13 - Yeah, this town is a hotbed
for criminal activity.\\
14 - Hey, let's not forget the
great ten-speed robbery of '74.\\
15 - Yeah, or that
criminal mastermind\\
16 - who stole my mum's garden gnome.\\
17 - Guys, I have very exciting news.\\
18 - I'm in a mentor programme
for little girls,\\
19 - kind of like a Big Sister thing.\\
20 - And there's someone here
who's very anxious to meet you.\\
21 - Come here.\\
22 - Isn't she cute?
I call her Little Jackie.\\
23 - For the last freaking time,
my name is Colette.\\
24 - I'm trying to like her,
she's just a little mouthy.\\
25 - Jackie, why would you be
a Big Sister?\\
26 - Well, it's a community
service project for school.\\
27 - It was either this or helping
out at a senior center.\\
28 - And you know how gray hair
gives me nightmares.\\
29 - Can I leave now?
There's nothing to do.\\
30 - Here, take these pictures of me\\
31 - and put them
in order of cuteness,\\
32 - from "Very cute" to "It's
just not fair she's so cute."\\
33 - Lame, lamer, lamest.\\
34 - I like her.\\
35 - - Yeah, me, too.
- She's feisty.\\
36 - Nice nametag.
Are you a garbage man?\\
37 - It's a badge!\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - Get away from me!\\
48 - I bet that's the first time
you said that to a man.\\
49 - Don't you walk out that door.\\
50 - Don't you walk
through that door!\\
51 - What the hell was that
all about?\\
52 - They have been fighting
like that all morning.\\
53 - Sometimes he even yells at her
in his native language.\\
54 - I believe the main idea is,
she gets around.\\
55 - Ah, to be young and trapped\\
56 - in a loveless sham
of a marriage.\\
57 - - Kitty, where's the coffee?
- I'm sorry, I almost forgot.\\
58 - Since no one fixed my sink yet,\\
59 - today instead of coffee,\\
60 - we're having pipe sludge.\\
61 - You know the doctor told me
not to do household chores.\\
62 - It's either a working sink
or a dead husband.\\
63 - It's your choice.\\
64 - Well, Red, somebody's gotta
do something around here.\\
65 - The garage needs to be painted,\\
66 - the lawnmower won't start,\\
67 - and I'm getting tired of
running to the hose\\
68 - every time I need
a bourbon and water.\\
69 - Fine, fine,
we'll let Eric do it.\\
70 - Maybe if I supervise him,\\
71 - he'll only screw up
half as much.\\
72 - Yeah, thanks, Dad.
You know what? I got it.\\
73 - Yeah. This from the kid
who gets sweaty\\
74 - when he has to
change out the toilet paper.\\
75 - Don't you walk back
into that house.\\
76 - Don't you walk back
into the house!\\
77 - Officer Kennedy?\\
78 - I want you to know that even
though it's my first ride-along,\\
79 - I'm not afraid to kill a man.\\
80 - I just don't wanna touch him
after he's dead.\\
81 - Shut it, Cadet.
Here, take care of the radio.\\
82 - Cool. We each get our own
walkie-talkies?\\
83 - I'd like a pepperoni pizza.\\
84 - Address,
Hauling Ass Down Central.\\
85 - Hey, if you wanna play games,
go join the highway patrol.\\
86 - Unit 10, we've got
a 415 in progress.\\
87 - - Cool. What's a 415?
- Why don't you look
in your manual?\\
88 - "A canine defecating
on private property."\\
89 - Cool! It's a dog crapping
on a lawn! Gun it!\\
90 - A 415 is a domestic
disturbance, you chowder head.\\
91 - Oh.\\
92 - Damn, I always wanted to
put a dog in handcuffs.\\
93 - - I want you out! Out, I say!
- It's my house!\\
94 - Oh, really? Because you didn't
sleep here last night.\\
95 - Or the night before that.\\
96 - Or the night before that.\\
97 - To be fair, Fez, her army
buddies only get a three-day pass.\\
98 - - Listen to me...
- No, you listen...\\
99 - Pipe down!
The neighbors are staring.\\
100 - Don't mind us.
Just practicing for a show.\\
101 - Take a bow and get in the house.\\
102 - Whoa, it's the Five-O.
Better go hide my stash.\\
103 - Comic books.
And comic book paraphernalia.\\
104 - What seems
to be the problem here?\\
105 - - Put that down.
- Put that down.\\
106 - - No, put that down!
- Put what down?\\
107 - Give me that.\\
108 - Now, what seems to be
the problem here?\\
109 - I'll tell you what the problem
is. I am married to a whore.\\
110 - I am not a whore!\\
111 - I'm just a girl
who likes a good time.\\
112 - I'm sorry. I can't imagine
who would've called the police.\\
113 - It's about time you showed up.\\
114 - These two were making
so much noise,\\
115 - I couldn't enjoy my programme.\\
116 - Bob, you really
had to call the police?\\
117 - Sorry, Kitty, but how am I
supposed to name that tune\\
118 - if I can't even hear the notes?\\
119 - Okay. Well, this kid
seems to be harmless,\\
120 - but since you're training, why
don't you frisk him anyway?\\
121 - Sure, frisk the foreign guy.\\
122 - The color of my skin
is not a crime!\\
123 - Why do you have a frog
in your pocket?\\
124 - It's a surprise for the ladies.\\
125 - Oh! He peed on me!
That's resisting arrest.\\
126 - Well, then I'm about
to resist arrest, too.\\
127 - Dad, that was pretty cool how I shut
off all the water in the house, huh?\\
128 - Yeah, you really instill
a lot of confidence,\\
129 - muttering "lefty loosey,
righty tighty" the whole time.\\
130 - Okay, let's get started.\\
131 - Now, this is a wrench.\\
132 - - Dad, I think I know
what tools are.
- Good.\\
133 - Then grab the Philips head.\\
134 - Uh, shouldn't I buy Philip
a drink first?\\
135 - Come on!\\
136 - We're just a couple guys having
some fun on the job, lighten up.\\
137 - Get a little "lefty-loosey".\\
138 - Do you even know what a
Philips head screwdriver is?\\
139 - I know it's a screwdriver.\\
140 - Now.\\
141 - The water's off.
Why is the water off?\\
142 - We gotta fix the pipes.\\
143 - - But I have to use
the bathroom.
- What?\\
144 - - I have to use the bathroom!
- Well, go ahead.\\
145 - But you only get one flush,
so make it count.\\
146 - Well, I guess I can hold it.
I just hope I don't sneeze.\\
147 - - Would you sit still?
- Jackie, she's not a doll.\\
148 - Well, not a good one, anyway.\\
149 - I don't want a makeover. You're supposed
to be helping me with my homework.\\
150 - Homework is for ugly girls.\\
151 - Okay?\\
152 - Pretty girls get geeky boys
to do their homework for them.\\
153 - Jackie, you're supposed to do
fun stuff, like go roller-skating,\\
154 - not teach her to prostitute
herself for geometry notes.\\
155 - She's cool. Why can't
she be my Big Sister?\\
156 - See, Donna already has a
little sister. Her name's Eric.\\
157 - Okay, get under the sink and loosen
that disposal so we can get to the pipes.\\
158 - Under there?\\
159 - But it's all spidery.\\
160 - Get under there
or you're gonna get a spider\\
161 - the size of my foot in your ass.\\
162 - I just realized something.\\
163 - After all the years of
me helping you fix stuff,\\
164 - you finally have to
hold the flashlight for me.\\
165 - Lower, dumb ass!\\
166 - All right, I'm in.
I'm just gonna loosen the...\\
167 - Spider! Big one!
Oh, my God, it touched me!\\
168 - A Brillo pad? You were
afraid of a Brillo pad?\\
169 - It bit me.\\
170 - Boy, somewhere down the line
I failed with you.\\
171 - You know, I think it was that
one day when you were 10\\
172 - and I caught you
with those dolls.\\
173 - They were action figures.\\
174 - I want to go to the movies.\\
175 - Why? You're watching me
live my life.\\
176 - It's better than any movie.\\
177 - Afternoon, civilians.\\
178 - Where's my frog,
you son of a bitch?\\
179 - Well, the good news is
I let him loose.\\
180 - And the bad news is he
hopped in front of an 18-wheeler.\\
181 - Now, he dodged the first
wheel, but the last 17 got him.\\
182 - Hey, did you show up
in a cop car?\\
183 - Yeah. My training officer let
me take the cruiser out for a spin.\\
184 - Mind if we check it out?\\
185 - Fine. Just don't
touch anything.\\
186 - I'll be in the bathroom taking
care of some police business.\\
187 - Or as the boys down
at the station like to say,\\
188 - I'll be taking a 10-100.\\
189 - How would you like
to see a police car?\\
190 - I already saw one when the
police took my daddy to jail.\\
191 - All right. You know what? Cheer
up, or you're not getting lunch.\\
192 - Jackie!\\
193 - Oh, Donna, don't worry,
you're getting lunch.\\
194 - Okay, you know what?\\
195 - You don't have a clue when
it comes to dealing with kids.\\
196 - Well, if you think you're so good
at it, why don't you give it a shot?\\
197 - Okay, I will.\\
198 - Come on, Colette, you've just
been upgraded to Little Donna.\\
199 - What... You know what?
It is your loss\\
200 - because I was gonna
let you give me a pedicure.\\
201 - I can't believe they
trusted Kelso with a cop car.\\
202 - I can't believe
he left the keys in it.\\
203 - Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?\\
204 - Burn rubber, little buddy.\\
205 - Hey!\\
206 - You're out of soap
in the men's room.\\
207 - My eagle eye catches everything.\\
208 - This is so exciting.
What should we do next?\\
209 - Plant some evidence?\\
210 - Bust some prostitutes?\\
211 - Plant some evidence in
the bust of some prostitutes?\\
212 - Oh, hey, check it out.
A walkie-talkie.\\
213 - Freeze! You're under arrest.\\
214 - Freeze, you're under arrest!\\
215 - Freeze. You're under arrest!
All right, that's the one.\\
216 - This is Officer Michael
Kelso. And I'm not wearing any pants!\\
217 - Am I supposed to be driving
all over the road?\\
218 - 'Cause I'm loaded.\\
219 - My car's gone!
Somebody call the police!\\
220 - Okay, that's it. I can't
fix it. I just... I can't do it.\\
221 - What's the problem now?\\
222 - Did the fuzzy dishtowel
jump out and attack you?\\
223 - I can't believe you said
you failed with me.\\
224 - Oh, come on.
That was a joke.\\
225 - You know, like, "A priest
and a rabbi walk into a bar,"\\
226 - or "I failed with you."\\
227 - - Do you really think that?
- No, not completely.\\
228 - I mean... Maybe you're not
good at fixing stuff.\\
229 - But you stayed behind from
school to help the family out.\\
230 - And that's admirable.\\
231 - Yeah.\\
232 - Yeah, it is.\\
233 - Some might say it's the greatest
gift a son could give his father.\\
234 - No, the greatest gift
a son could give his father\\
235 - is a Heisman Trophy.\\
236 - Look, you've tortured yourself
enough for one day.\\
237 - - Let's just pack it up
and call the plumber.
- No, no.\\
238 - Look, I can fix some things.\\
239 - Boba Fett's jetpack doesn't
just glue itself back on.\\
240 - You know what? I'm gonna
fix the lawnmower. Right now.\\
241 - Now, why would you wanna
embarrass yourself like that?\\
242 - I mean, I'll be standing there
and you'll be standing there,\\
243 - and the mower won't work,\\
244 - and I'll say something mean
and claim it's a joke.\\
245 - I'm gonna fix that lawnmower.\\
246 - I'm gonna fix
the hell out of it.\\
247 - And when I'm done, you're
gonna be able to race that baby\\
248 - at the Indy 500.\\
249 - Now, look, Son,
just so you know,\\
250 - the lawnmower's the red thing
with the wheels on it.\\
251 - Yeah? Well, not for long!\\
252 - More news after this.\\
253 - You know, if a white man
had stolen that car,\\
254 - it'd be all over that news.\\
255 - Fez, not having
every cop in Wisconsin\\
256 - looking for us
is probably a good thing.\\
257 - Shut up, whitey.\\
258 - Has anyone seen Little Jackie?\\
259 - - No. Why?
- Never mind.\\
260 - Oh, my God.
You lost Little Jackie?\\
261 - No, I didn't lose Little...
Jackie!\\
262 - We're playing hide-and-seek
and she's really, really good.\\
263 - Oh, so you look for her,
but when you play with Fez,\\
264 - you let him sit
in the closet all day.\\
265 - I cannot believe you, Donna.\\
266 - You said I didn't know what I
was doing, and look at what you did.\\
267 - Okay, are you going to
help me find her or not?\\
268 - Well, I'm gonna have to.
I mean, this is serious.\\
269 - If we don't find
that little girl,\\
270 - I'm gonna get, like,
half-hour detention.\\
271 - Okay.\\
272 - Where's my cop car?\\
273 - You know what?
I'm gonna count to three.\\
274 - And before I'm done, you'd
better tell me where it is.\\
275 - One, two...\\
276 - Two-and-a-half.\\
277 - Three.\\
278 - No, you can't say "three".
That's not how it works.\\
279 - Did my frog know how it worked
when he saw that tire coming?\\
280 - His tiny green life flashing
before his eyes?\\
281 - Guys, come on, you can't
just take somebody's car\\
282 - without asking permission.\\
283 - And especially since I kind of
took it without asking permission.\\
284 - - What?
- You stoled it?\\
285 - I was supposed to be watching it\\
286 - while my training officer
got a haircut.\\
287 - They're gonna have
my paper badge for this.\\
288 - Mom, Dad, come quick!
I fixed it! I fixed it.\\
289 - It was like God had control
over my hands.\\
290 - - Let me... Let me start it for you.
- Eric, don't.\\
291 - I've seen you use a wrench.\\
292 - If you went lefty-loosey instead
of righty-tighty, we could all die.\\
293 - - Let me just
put this in the garage.
- Wait, but, Dad...\\
294 - No, no, honey, honey. Your
father's right. It's not safe.\\
295 - We'll let Bob start it later.\\
296 - What did you do?\\
297 - Why? Why?
Why is it always my house?\\
298 - You really wanna know, or
you wanna just keep yelling?\\
299 - I wanna keep yelling.\\
300 - I don't care whose fault it is.\\
301 - Just get that thing
out of here now!\\
302 - Yes, sir.\\
303 - All right, everybody. Show's
over, let's go in the house.\\
304 - Dad, the lawnmower. I fixed
the lawnmower, you've gotta see.\\
305 - Kelso, wait!\\
306 - Hey, look, Fez,
just like your frog.\\
307 - Well, it was broken anyway.\\
308 - No, it wasn't.\\
309 - I fixed it.\\
310 - Mom, you believe me, don't you?\\
311 - Of course I do, honey.\\
312 - I believe that you believe
you fixed it.\\
313 - Why are you in my seat?\\
314 - This automobile has not moved.\\
315 - Wait, you didn't ask me that.\\
316 - Did you touch anything?\\
317 - Because if you did,
you are in big trouble.\\
318 - No, I can assure you,
everything is exactly as you left it.\\
319 - Hey, Kelso, did you get
the cop car back\\
320 - before your boss found out
you stole it?\\
321 - Okay, that...
I can explain that.\\
322 - Where am I?\\
323 - I can't explain that.\\
324 - Socket wrench.\\
325 - Drives the spaceship.
Sits next to the hairy guy.\\
326 - Han Solo.\\
327 - Flathead screwdriver.\\
328 - I know this. Guy with
the breathing problem.\\
329 - "Guy with the breathing problem."
This is Darth freaking Vader.\\
330 - Seriously, Dad, if you don't
know the Dark Lord of the Sith,\\
331 - the most hated enemy
of the Jedi warrior,\\
332 - then I guess somewhere
down the line I failed with you.\\
333 - Marker.\\
334 - Oh! He peed on me!\\
335 - That's resisting arrest.\\
336 - That's resisting arrest.\\
337 - Put that down.\\
338 - Give it to me!\\
339 - Give me that.\\
340 - God.
\subsection {Episode 10: A Legal Matter}
1 - Guys, there are actual
stewardesses out there,\\
2 - and one of them talked to me.\\
3 - I made this joke
about how they just flew in\\
4 - and their arms must be tired.\\
5 - Yeah, great.\\
6 - Kelso, their neckerchiefs
are undone.\\
7 - You can see their necks.\\
8 - Look, I don't have time
for stewardess neck.\\
9 - I gotta study.\\
10 - They're really riding me
down at the Police Academy,\\
11 - and I don't know why.\\
12 - I know why. It's fun.\\
13 - They even chose me last
to work on the CPR dummy,\\
14 - so everybody's spit
was all over it.\\
15 - Even Johnson's spit, and
he's got a monster cold sore.\\
16 - I know why they're doing that.
I bet you're the stooge.\\
17 - What?\\
18 - Every year, the Police Academy
lets one guy in they know will fail out.\\
19 - They use him
to scare the other cadets.\\
20 - I know 'cause my brother
was a stooge.\\
21 - All right, fine, it was me.\\
22 - Oh, man, I'm the stooge.\\
23 - Hey, come on.\\
24 - Kelso, if that were true, you'd have had
to have been a screw-up your whole life.\\
25 - I mean, sure, you've fallen
off the water tower every year\\
26 - since junior high.\\
27 - You broke your arm
wrestling a dog.\\
28 - And heck, no one's eaten
more change than you.\\
29 - All right, I gotta say
you guys are making\\
30 - a pretty good case
that I'm the stooge!\\
31 - Well, if you're not,\\
32 - there's a guy who's about to step
on a rake that I really wanna meet.\\
33 - Hanging out\\
34 - Down the street\\
35 - The same old thing\\
36 - We did last week\\
37 - Not a thing to do\\
38 - But talk to you\\
39 - We're all all right\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
42 - I can't believe I'm the stooge.\\
43 - Michael, it's just the way
some people are. Okay?\\
44 - Some people are lazy,
some people are clumsy,\\
45 - some people are stooges.\\
46 - You're lucky enough
to be all three.\\
47 - Kelso, keep in mind you're
being called a stooge by a stooge\\
48 - while a third stooge
sits idly by.\\
49 - Compliment accepted.\\
50 - Now, listen, you nincompoops,\\
51 - these pies are for some
very important clients.\\
52 - Nothing should happen
to these pies, got that?\\
53 - Sure thing, boss.\\
54 - Well, nice going, you knucklehead.
Now we gotta wash them.\\
55 - Wanna give me a hand?\\
56 - Bravo, bravo.\\
57 - So, we got a wise guy, huh?\\
58 - Oh, yeah? Take this.\\
59 - How's it going with those...\\
60 - Pies?\\
61 - Ugh. The Three Stooges
have such bad hair.\\
62 - You know, I wish I can
go back in time\\
63 - for just 10 minutes\\
64 - and hand out combs and brushes.\\
65 - Guys, can we focus here?\\
66 - I gotta figure out
if I'm the stooge or not.\\
67 - Well, why don't you just, like,\\
68 - ask your captain or something?\\
69 - He won't tell me.
That's the whole point!\\
70 - I gotta get a look at my file,\\
71 - which means I gotta break
into the Police Academy.\\
72 - Okay. You see how you took
something that made sense\\
73 - and then made it weird?\\
74 - That's part of the problem.\\
75 - That's what I like
about you, Kelso.\\
76 - You can make a mess
out of anything.\\
77 - I'm in.\\
78 - Yeah, well, not me.\\
79 - Breaking into a place
where they train people\\
80 - to shoot you if you break
into a place, it's...\\
81 - Come on, Eric. We're a team.\\
82 - Yeah, Michael's the looks,\\
83 - Steven's the brain and you,\\
84 - your house has food.\\
85 - Hey, remember when we shoplifted\\
86 - those baseball cards?\\
87 - We were 12 years old,\\
88 - and I didn't shoplift anything.\\
89 - That's right. You went home
and told your mommy.\\
90 - You mama's boy.\\
91 - Well, did you want that
on your permanent record?\\
92 - Yeah, I didn't think so, mister.\\
93 - Oh, God,
I am a mama's boy. I'm in.\\
94 - Now, the secret to really good
fudge is a tiny bit of Kahlua.\\
95 - You must make a lot of fudge,
'cause the bottle's almost empty.\\
96 - No. Well, it's a tiny bit
of Kahlua for the fudge,\\
97 - a tiny bit for the chef.\\
98 - That's how you make cooking fun.\\
99 - Apparently, it also works
for sewing\\
100 - and laundry and sitting
around watching TV.\\
101 - Okay, the INS called.\\
102 - I have to go in
for a final review\\
103 - before I can pick up
my green card.\\
104 - I bet they give you a test
on US history.\\
105 - See, America is strict
about who we let in here,\\
106 - 'cause we have stuff
that people wanna steal.\\
107 - Unlike your lesser countries
like Canada and France.\\
108 - See, this is when a bobby pin
comes in handy.\\
109 - Why do you have a bobby pin?\\
110 - I'm training my hair, okay?
I want more wave, less fluff.\\
111 - Guys, this is serious. Let's just
find my file and get out of here.\\
112 - Hey, what's in here?\\
113 - Oh, it's the canine
training room.\\
114 - It's where they keep
all the samples\\
115 - to teach the police dogs
what to sniff for.\\
116 - Oh, man, these samples are
way better than our samples.\\
117 - Did you see how quickly
I sniffed them out?\\
118 - I could so be a police dog.\\
119 - Cool, training collar.\\
120 - You know, I still don't get how
they could think I'm the stooge.\\
121 - I'm, like,
so on top of everything.\\
122 - What's this thing do?\\
123 - Give me that, Kelso.\\
124 - Gonna hurt yourself.\\
125 - Hyde, that really hurts.\\
126 - Okay, do it one more time.\\
127 - Okay, so, this is George
Washington, the father of our country.\\
128 - Well, George and I
have one thing in common.\\
129 - We both look good
in a powder white wig.\\
130 - Okay, so Fez, the Statue of
Liberty was a gift from the French.\\
131 - The French?
I didn't know that.\\
132 - You didn't know that?\\
133 - I really don't think
it's common knowledge.\\
134 - Okay, I painted my nails through
two semesters of American history\\
135 - and even I knew that.\\
136 - Well, don't I feel like the
hillbilly who wandered into town.\\
137 - Well, it's no big deal,
Mrs. Forman.\\
138 - Oh, I see. It's no big deal for you
smart people who know everything,\\
139 - but for us hillbillies, well, we're
lucky if we know how to tie our shoes\\
140 - and flush the toilet.\\
141 - Okay, Mrs. Forman,
please don't get upset.\\
142 - Okay, here,
drink some more fudge.\\
143 - Okay, so...\\
144 - - The constitution
was ratified...
- Oh, I know this. 1776.\\
145 - Oh, you're thinking of the
Declaration of Independence.\\
146 - - See, the constitution was...
- I know what
the constitution is.\\
147 - - Can you make fudge?
- What?\\
148 - Then can it.\\
149 - Okay, what if they ask me about
current events? Tell me about Vietnam.\\
150 - Okay, so Vietnam was an
illegal war, which we lost.\\
151 - What the hell
are you teaching him?\\
152 - You come with me.\\
153 - I'll teach you the real
American history.\\
154 - First of all, we didn't
lose the war. It was a tie.\\
155 - Besides, they're grateful.
They have McDonald's now.\\
156 - Here's my file. It doesn't
say stooge anywhere.\\
157 - Good picture,
but that's no shocker.\\
158 - But this is.\\
159 - Ah!\\
160 - I think the batteries
are starting to go.\\
161 - That one didn't hurt as much.\\
162 - You better let me
hold onto this file.\\
163 - I won't leave any fingerprints
thanks to my cool new black gloves.\\
164 - Man, if only these shot webs.\\
165 - Aren't those
your mom's Isotoners?\\
166 - All right, guys, I gotta figure
out if I'm in trouble or not.\\
167 - What the hell
is going on in here?\\
168 - I'm gonna go with
"you're in trouble".\\
169 - Cadet Kelso, do you know
what the penalty is\\
170 - for breaking
into the Academy office?\\
171 - No, sir, Officer Kennedy, sir.\\
172 - There are none, because
nobody's been stupid enough to do it!\\
173 - All right, you're first
in your class.\\
174 - Is that a dog training collar
around your neck?\\
175 - You're probably gonna want this.\\
176 - It's the red button.\\
177 - Look, sir,
I think you should know\\
178 - that at the last police
charity auction,\\
179 - my family bought one of your
Christmas tree ornaments,\\
180 - Santa driving a cop car.\\
181 - Funniest thing
on the tree it was.\\
182 - Anyway, please don't call
my mom and dad. Thanks.\\
183 - - What's your name?
- They call me Fez.\\
184 - Officer Kennedy, sir,\\
185 - I broke in to find out if I
was the stooge or not, sir.\\
186 - You're not the stooge.
Johnson's the stooge.\\
187 - Yes.\\
188 - But you're the stooge now.\\
189 - Okay, I think that we've
been reviewing long enough.\\
190 - Let's see what you've learnt.
I'll start you off with an easy one.\\
191 - - Where do you live?
- Amedica.\\
192 - It's pronounced America.\\
193 - That's what I said, Amedica.\\
194 - - America.
- Amedica.\\
195 - Why do we celebrate
the Fourth of July?\\
196 - Because we are damn glad
not to be\\
197 - a bunch of British,
tea-drinking nancy pants.\\
198 - Nobody's gonna argue
with that answer.\\
199 - America!\\
200 - Amedica!\\
201 - - America!
- Amedica!\\
202 - What was President
Dwight D. Eisenhower's\\
203 - greatest achievement?\\
204 - He led the Allies to victory
in World War II\\
205 - and sent those jackbooted
Nazi bastards home\\
206 - to cry in their sauerkraut.\\
207 - I didn't understand
a word you said,\\
208 - but I heard "Nazi bastards",
and that's good enough for me.\\
209 - - America!
- Amedica!\\
210 - Look, there is no damn "D"
in America.\\
211 - - Say my son's name.
- Eric.\\
212 - Great.\\
213 - Now, America.\\
214 - Amedica.\\
215 - Just forget it.
Just say, United States.\\
216 - United States of Amedica.\\
217 - Guys, I'm really screwed down
at the Police Academy.\\
218 - Officer Kennedy told me he's
looking for any reason to kick me out.\\
219 - Okay, but did he say anything
about calling my parents?\\
220 - I was so freaked out that I
completely blew this exam this morning.\\
221 - I'm sure you did fine.\\
222 - Roy, the first question was,
"Stop, in the name of the blank."\\
223 - And I wrote "Love".\\
224 - I don't care
what they say, Kelso.\\
225 - Love is always the right answer.\\
226 - So you screwed up a test, man.\\
227 - You know what you have to do.\\
228 - Yeah, yeah.
Study more next time.\\
229 - What are you? Forman?\\
230 - You gotta break in there
and change the answers.\\
231 - I can't break in there again.\\
232 - That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.\\
233 - That's why they'll never
expect it, man.\\
234 - Look, they don't know
you've got a friend like me\\
235 - to talk you into doing something
so fundamentally moronic.\\
236 - That's true.\\
237 - You know what? I'm in, too.
I know it's dangerous,\\
238 - but I just really like
wearing that outfit.\\
239 - Trust me, it'll work. How do
you think I got through chemistry?\\
240 - Hey, you told me
you blackmailed the teacher\\
241 - because you caught him
smoking up behind the gym.\\
242 - Oh, yeah. How do you think
I got through biology?\\
243 - Fez, relax.
You're gonna pass the test.\\
244 - No, this could be
my last day in the country.\\
245 - We should probably make love.\\
246 - What?\\
247 - Don't worry. It'll be over
before you know it.\\
248 - So, on the way back from the
bathroom, I got proposed to three times.\\
249 - I must look
more gorgeous than usual.\\
250 - Jackie, the only reason
they wanna marry you\\
251 - is so they can stay
in the country.\\
252 - Jealous.\\
253 - Okay, here I go.\\
254 - I'm here for my test.
Where do I sign in?\\
255 - Or should I say, "Where
do I put my John Hancock?"\\
256 - Actually, I would sign my name.\\
257 - Just the common expression.\\
258 - I know so much history, I just
drop it into everyday conversation.\\
259 - There is no test.\\
260 - I just need to see that you
are who you say you are\\
261 - and that you're in the country to
be with your wife, Laurie Forman.\\
262 - No test? So, that's it?\\
263 - I'm truly really a citizen
of this great country?\\
264 - Just as soon
as I stamp this paper.\\
265 - Oh, this is great. You
and I should go celebrate.\\
266 - Let's start off with a couple
of drinks and some lovemaking\\
267 - and see where it goes
from there.\\
268 - I don't date married men.\\
269 - Well, let's just say that as
soon as I get my green card,\\
270 - I will be single.\\
271 - Then you can explore
the country of Fez.\\
272 - Hold on, are you telling me
your marriage is a sham?\\
273 - I'm telling you your eyes are
like amber waves of green.\\
274 - You do realize
I haven't stamped this yet?\\
275 - Actually, I had not.\\
276 - - Oh, he looks happy.
- Yeah, I bet he's doing great.\\
277 - Yeah.\\
278 - - Shouldn't you stamp
my paper now?
- I don't think so.\\
279 - - In a minute?
- Nope.\\
280 - - After lunch?
- Uh-uh.\\
281 - Would you like me to stamp it?\\
282 - Red, do you think I'm smart?\\
283 - Oh, is that what we're gonna
do today? We're gonna fight?\\
284 - Great news, I got my green card.\\
285 - I am now, officially,
a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\\
286 - - So, you passed the test, huh?
- Oh, there was no test.\\
287 - No test? Oh, we're just
as bad as Canada.\\
288 - So, what happened?\\
289 - Well, you know how sometimes I
come on a little strong to the ladies?\\
290 - You can be a little handsy.\\
291 - It was touch and go for a while,\\
292 - but, eventually, I won the
INS lady over with my charm.\\
293 - More like you cried until she
felt bad and stamped your papers.\\
294 - Hey, tomato, potato,
it's all the same thing.\\
295 - Bottom line is, I have chadisma.\\
296 - - Charisma.
- Yes, chadisma.\\
297 - Man, I love these gloves.\\
298 - I wish there was some diamond\\
299 - protected by lasers
I could steal.\\
300 - Okay, I'm almost done.\\
301 - I just gotta think
of one more misdemeanor.\\
302 - Oh, breaking into
the Police Academy.\\
303 - All right, come on. Let's go.\\
304 - How do you keep finding us?\\
305 - I'm wearing all black.\\
306 - I sleep right next door.\\
307 - What's the problem?
Trouble with the wife?\\
308 - Shut up.\\
309 - That's it, you're out of here!\\
310 - Wait, I can explain.\\
311 - Okay, this whole thing started
because I just...\\
312 - I can't be the stooge, okay?\\
313 - I'm gonna be a dad soon, and
no kid is gonna look up to his dad\\
314 - if his dad is the stooge.\\
315 - Well, unless the kid's a stooge,\\
316 - in which case I wouldn't
love him anyway.\\
317 - You're gonna be a father?\\
318 - Who would breed with you?\\
319 - One night stand,
both a little drunk.\\
320 - Look, I know I messed up,\\
321 - but can't you just maybe...\\
322 - Give me one more chance.\\
323 - All right. Since you're
gonna be a father,\\
324 - I'm gonna let what
happened here slide.\\
325 - But just so
you don't do this again,\\
326 - I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.\\
327 - There is no stooge.\\
328 - What?\\
329 - That's just a rumor we started
to get the cadets to work harder.\\
330 - Also, there's no alligator
in the lake.\\
331 - Wait. Wait, wait.
If there's no stooge,\\
332 - then how come our friend Roy\\
333 - told us he got kicked out of
the Academy for being a stooge?\\
334 - Roy Keen?\\
335 - He didn't get kicked out
for being a stooge.\\
336 - He got kicked out
for shooting the police horse.\\
337 - Look, Cadet, all you have to
do is work hard and you'll be fine.\\
338 - Now you clean up this mess
and get out of here.\\
339 - Well, I think we all learned
an important lesson here.\\
340 - If you're in trouble and your
back's up against the wall,\\
341 - just tell them you got a kid.\\
342 - People are suckers for a baby.\\
343 - That is a valuable lesson.\\
344 - I think we should all reflect on
that in the canine training room.\\
345 - - I call shock collar.
- I call button.\\
346 - Okay, Miss Smarty Pants,
how about...\\
347 - Oh.\\
348 - Where was the famous tea party?\\
349 - - Boston.
- Nope.\\
350 - - What?
- Got it wrong. Sorry.\\
351 - It's the Boston Tea Party.\\
352 - No, it says right here,
it's the Boston Tea Party.\\
353 - Oh.\\
354 - I'm gonna have
a Long Island tea party.
\subsection {Episode 11: I Can See for Miles}
1 - So, guys, guess what?\\
2 - I found the perfect place for
me and Eric to get married.\\
3 - "Where, Donna?
Please tell us."\\
4 - Okay. Well, that place up
by the lake\\
5 - that overlooks the entire valley\\
6 - where people go for romance.\\
7 - Wait, Mount Hump?\\
8 - People don't go there
for the romance, Donna.\\
9 - They go there for the humping.\\
10 - Eric, let's go out there
tomorrow and check it out.\\
11 - I know the Cruiser's in the shop,
but we can take my dad's car.\\
12 - Donna, he's got that "Honk if
you're horny" bumper sticker.\\
13 - Yeah, well, I'd scrape it off,\\
14 - but "I brake for boobies"
is underneath it.\\
15 - Why are you guys
all in Steven's room?\\
16 - Well, Hyde was here,\\
17 - so I came in because
I'm not comfortable enough\\
18 - with myself to be alone.\\
19 - Yeah, but it's all gray
like a prison cell.\\
20 - Gray is why prisoners
are unhappy.\\
21 - Really? I always thought
it was the loss of freedom\\
22 - and the uninvited man-love.\\
23 - Steven, I just think
that you would be happier\\
24 - if you saw pretty things.\\
25 - Like, when I look
at myself in the mirror,\\
26 - I'm happy.\\
27 - When I look at you,
I'm happy, too.\\
28 - But when you talk... Eh...\\
29 - Hey, Eric, I have to ask you
a very important question.\\
30 - Can I borrow your G.I. Joe
for a little experiment?\\
31 - - No.
- I thought you were
going to say yes.\\
32 - And, by the way,
the experiment was a success.\\
33 - G.I. Joe melts faster
than cheese.\\
34 - Kelso, you can't just take my
things without asking permission.\\
35 - Come on, we're friends.\\
36 - I figured, what's mine is
yours and what's yours is mine.\\
37 - What's Donna's is mine, too.\\
38 - Kelso!\\
39 - Yeah, Barbie didn't
make it either.\\
40 - No one likes to see
civilian casualties.\\
41 - That's weird.\\
42 - My finger's due back tomorrow,\\
43 - but my hand's
due back next week.\\
44 - You know, Michael, I was a little
worried about starting to date you,\\
45 - but lately you've really
impressed me.\\
46 - Well, that's the police motto,
"To Serve and Impress."\\
47 - I thought it was
"Serve and Protect."\\
48 - Yeah, they just changed it.\\
49 - Maybe you could take me to my
doctor's appointment tomorrow.\\
50 - We'll hear the baby's heartbeat.\\
51 - Seriously?\\
52 - - You want me to do
baby stuff with you?
- Yeah.\\
53 - You've been really great
these last few weeks.\\
54 - Yes, I have.\\
55 - And there's no telling
what you'll do next.\\
56 - One day, you might even
read one of these things.\\
57 - Yeah, let's just pray to God
that day never comes.\\
58 - Hanging out\\
59 - Down the street\\
60 - The same old thing\\
61 - We did last week\\
62 - Not a thing to do\\
63 - But talk to you\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - We're all all right\\
66 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
67 - Stupid Kelso.\\
68 - Guess what I packed?\\
69 - I'm gonna
have to go with picnic.\\
70 - You win.\\
71 - So when do I get my car back?\\
72 - Well, I don't know.\\
73 - We're scouting places
to have the wedding.\\
74 - You don't need to scout anywhere\\
75 - but the inside of a church.\\
76 - What better place
to start a happy life\\
77 - than Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow?\\
78 - Well, Dad, the thing is\\
79 - we're not getting married
in a church.\\
80 - But we are thinking
about getting married\\
81 - at Mount Hump,\\
82 - which is sort of the church
of humping.\\
83 - Well, no church, no car,\\
84 - just like it says in the Bible.\\
85 - Well, the Bible
doesn't say anything\\
86 - about taking Kelso's van.\\
87 - All right, Donna,
we can't just take it.\\
88 - Of course we can.\\
89 - What's his is yours, remember?\\
90 - Do it for the liquefied face
of G.I. Joe.\\
91 - I can't think
of a more fitting way\\
92 - to honor the real American hero.\\
93 - You're welcome, big guy.\\
94 - - What's this for?
- No reason.\\
95 - I was just thinking about you\\
96 - and how we've been through
a lot together.\\
97 - No, we haven't.\\
98 - Oh, he gave you shoes.\\
99 - What do you say, Red?\\
100 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
101 - Or we say,
"Thank you very much."\\
102 - Well.\\
103 - Don't you think
it's a little odd for a man\\
104 - to give another man
a pair of shoes?\\
105 - I saw them. I thought they'd
go nice with your tan pants.\\
106 - Quit thinking about my pants.\\
107 - My legs and what covers them
is my business.\\
108 - He's very sensitive
about his legs.\\
109 - You know, he shouldn't be.
They're shapely like a lady dancer.\\
110 - Maybe that's why
he's so sensitive.\\
111 - Oh, finally. I've been waiting
all afternoon. I'm about to burst.\\
112 - Hey, man. I'm thinking maybe
you should wait out here.\\
113 - No. No, no, no.
Fez, you should see this.\\
114 - It's a dream come true.\\
115 - Surprise!\\
116 - Jackie, what the hell happened
to my room?\\
117 - I redecorated it.\\
118 - Now, if a stranger
comes in here,\\
119 - he'd never know you were poor.\\
120 - Looks like something for a girl.\\
121 - - I like it.
- Or Fez!\\
122 - I can't live like this. I'm
getting sick just looking at it.\\
123 - Yes. Yes, Steven.\\
124 - That sick feeling is your
orphan soul coming alive.\\
125 - Jackie, just put it
all back, okay?\\
126 - Make it ugly and dirty
like I like it.\\
127 - Well, excuse me,
for spending all morning\\
128 - putting up twinkle lights
that are breathtaking,\\
129 - pillows as soft as marshmallows,\\
130 - and sexy candles
that make you feel\\
131 - like you're running through a
field like Laura freaking Ingalls!\\
132 - Okay, okay.\\
133 - We came here for a reason.\\
134 - Now, should I start
and you watch\\
135 - or should you start and I watch?\\
136 - Either way, I'll be done first.\\
137 - So I told Hyde he could
watch while Jackie and I do it,\\
138 - and then he beat my ass
with a twinkle light.\\
139 - Where's my van?\\
140 - No, I parked it right here.\\
141 - Calm down, you probably
just lost it again.\\
142 - - Where was
the last place you had it?
- Right here!\\
143 - - Somebody stole my van!
- That's horrible!\\
144 - I left a brand-new bag
of Tootsie Rolls in there.\\
145 - - Fez!
- Okay, okay. It was just half a bag.\\
146 - But if you talk
to the insurance company,\\
147 - just tell them
it was a whole bag.\\
148 - I finally got Brooke
to trust me,\\
149 - and if I don't take her to this
doctor's appointment, I'm dead.\\
150 - - What am I gonna do?
- Don't beat yourself up.\\
151 - It's only Tootsie Rolls.\\
152 - You know,
I'm gonna take Red's car.\\
153 - I know he's got to hide a key
in there somewhere.\\
154 - Are you brain-damaged?\\
155 - Fez, did you just say,
"Are you brain-damaged?"\\
156 - and sound exactly like Red?\\
157 - Kelso, you know I only do
Johnny Carson and Pepe Le Pew.\\
158 - Get away from my car.\\
159 - Your car, my car.\\
160 - Aren't we all just
driving the same car?\\
161 - It's a car called "life."\\
162 - How about I drive my foot
into this thing called "your ass"?\\
163 - A simple "no" would suffice.\\
164 - Shoes are an inappropriate
gift to give another man.\\
165 - Well, what about
when you joined the service?\\
166 - Another man issued you
your boots.\\
167 - But then he gave me
a gun, so I let it go.\\
168 - Well, why don't you just
accept the shoes\\
169 - because Bob is your friend?\\
170 - You don't understand
how men work.\\
171 - We don't give
each other presents.\\
172 - We pretty much ignore each other\\
173 - until someone
scores a touchdown.\\
174 - You should listen to me.
I know how to be a friend,\\
175 - and you obviously don't,
since you don't have any.\\
176 - I have plenty of friends.\\
177 - Charlie's a friend. He
saved my life during the war.\\
178 - And when is the last time
you talked to Charlie?\\
179 - We said all we needed to say
on the boat back home.\\
180 - I don't believe this.\\
181 - This is crazy.\\
182 - Not bad!\\
183 - It feels so good\\
184 - Nice.\\
185 - You lying here next to me\\
186 - So soft.\\
187 - So smooth.\\
188 - You have no idea
how it feels\\
189 - My hands
just won't keep still\\
190 - Oh, yeah!\\
191 - Isn't this amazing?\\
192 - Is it called Mount Hump because
people come here to hump?\\
193 - Or do people come here to hump
because it's called Mount Hump?\\
194 - Like the chicken or the egg.\\
195 - Well, I have a really good
feeling about this place.\\
196 - Donna, there are panties
in the grass.\\
197 - Well, Fez collects panties.\\
198 - So we could just set him loose
up here before the ceremony.\\
199 - It's so quiet and peaceful.\\
200 - Can't hear anything.\\
201 - Actually, I hear a car.\\
202 - Oh, man! Some poor sucker
just totally got into an accident.\\
203 - Your chariot
has arrived, my lady.\\
204 - What happened to your van?\\
205 - Yeah, a little problem
with the van.\\
206 - I can't find it.\\
207 - Michael, people lose keys
to a van, not the whole van.\\
208 - Now I'm going to miss
my doctor's appointment.\\
209 - Look, Brooke,
this is not my fault.\\
210 - You're right, it's my fault
for depending on you.\\
211 - Okay, okay.
I can fix this, okay?\\
212 - Just hop on the handle bars
and I'll pedal you there.\\
213 - Hello! I'm pregnant.\\
214 - Okay, fine.
You pedal and I'll ride.\\
215 - Oh, look.\\
216 - Here you are
with all your friends.\\
217 - - Kitty.
- No, no, no.\\
218 - You claim to have
all these friends.\\
219 - Here are last year's
Christmas cards.\\
220 - Fifty-six are for me,
four for you.\\
221 - Kitty, the card from the Jose
Cuervo collector's club doesn't count.\\
222 - Fine, I can afford to throw this
one away because I have 55 more,\\
223 - but I will keep this
because it has a coupon in it.\\
224 - Anyway, it doesn't matter
because I'm keeping the shoes.\\
225 - A good shoe is a good shoe,
no matter where it comes from.\\
226 - Oh, it's like I'm walking
on a pile of baby ducks.\\
227 - Well, hello there,
Senor Fancy Sheets.\\
228 - I love the way
Jackie decorated your room.\\
229 - It's all glittery\\
230 - like an Italian person
lives there.\\
231 - You let your girlfriend
decorate your room?\\
232 - She also buy you a new dress?\\
233 - Yeah, I guess I have
a lot to answer for.\\
234 - Then again, I never accepted a
pair of shoes from another man.\\
235 - I knew it was a weird gift.\\
236 - Kitty said it wasn't.\\
237 - They're nice.
Steven, tell him they're nice.\\
238 - No, I can't do it.\\
239 - Although, you know what?
Maybe she's right.\\
240 - Maybe you should keep the shoes
and get Bob a present in return.\\
241 - Like a necklace.\\
242 - Or some sexy lingerie.\\
243 - Man, poor Kelso's van.\\
244 - I mean, when it finally
landed, it didn't so much crash\\
245 - as completely separate
into its basic elements\\
246 - and just return to nature.\\
247 - It was so sad.\\
248 - There were
Tootsie Rolls everywhere.\\
249 - Guys, took a nap in my room.\\
250 - My goose-down duvet
is like a cocoon.\\
251 - I lay down a caterpillar
and woke up a butterfly.\\
252 - Maybe you with your room
and Red with his shoes\\
253 - should get a room and decorate
it with Red's shoes. Burn!\\
254 - Man, you just don't understand
what it's like to have a bed\\
255 - that hugs you like
you're a little baby.\\
256 - It's like crawling
into a mommy kangaroo.\\
257 - I miss my kangaroo.\\
258 - Remember when I said that he should
decorate his room with Red's shoes?\\
259 - Burn!\\
260 - Hyde's in trouble.\\
261 - She took it all down.\\
262 - Did you just scream like a girl?\\
263 - No.\\
264 - What happened to my
lavender-scented candle?\\
265 - Did you just say "What happened
to my lavender-scented candle?"\\
266 - No.\\
267 - Oh, okay.
So I made appointments\\
268 - with all the doctors
in your address book\\
269 - because I didn't know which
one was the "'woo-woo" doctor.\\
270 - You know what?
Stay out of my stuff.\\
271 - I'll take care of things myself\\
272 - 'cause you obviously
aren't responsible enough\\
273 - to handle it.\\
274 - Oh, Kelso, you're here. Um...\\
275 - Hey, can I borrow your van
for a little experiment?\\
276 - No.\\
277 - Oh, I thought you were
gonna say yes.\\
278 - Oh, my God.\\
279 - - Is that my steering wheel?
- It's the biggest piece
I could find.\\
280 - Listen, Kelso,
I am so sorry. I...\\
281 - I took the van to Mount Hump,\\
282 - and I forgot to set
the parking brake\\
283 - and I'm just really sorry.\\
284 - The horn doesn't honk any more.\\
285 - Look, you know,
at first it seemed okay\\
286 - because you melted
my G.I. Joe,\\
287 - but I mean it's not as bad
as destroying a van.\\
288 - So I don't... I don't
know why I just said that.\\
289 - - I don't know what to say.
- Well, I do.\\
290 - You know, I called Michael
irresponsible, but he's not.\\
291 - You are. You're an
irresponsible, twitchy little man.\\
292 - Okay, please. Just don't
bump me with that thing.\\
293 - Okay, wait.
If he's irresponsible,\\
294 - that means I'm the good one.\\
295 - I'm the good one now!\\
296 - Yeah, he's obviously
the dumb one of your group.\\
297 - Yeah, he really is.\\
298 - Red Forman, don't you dare
throw those shoes away.\\
299 - I just can't keep them, Kitty.\\
300 - Every time I wear them, I'll
feel Bob touching my feet.\\
301 - Are you throwing away my shoes?\\
302 - No, no. No, no. He's not
throwing away your shoes.\\
303 - He is getting rid of
that pesky new shoe smell\\
304 - by rubbing old food on them.\\
305 - I'm throwing them away, Bob.\\
306 - Look, I appreciate the thought.\\
307 - No, well, that's not true.\\
308 - I mean, shoes are a weird
gift to give another man.\\
309 - I mean, what's next?
A weekend in Cancun?\\
310 - Okay, fine. I bought the shoes
for myself, but they pinch my toes,\\
311 - so I decided to pawn
them off on you as a gift.\\
312 - You were just trying
to screw me over?\\
313 - Well, I can respect that.\\
314 - Thanks for the shoes, Bob.\\
315 - See, I have a friend.\\
316 - No, no. This is not
the way friends act.\\
317 - He was gonna throw away
your present, Bob.\\
318 - Come on, Kitty.
I gave him shoes.\\
319 - That's weird.\\
320 - I'm surprised you didn't
punch me in the face right then.\\
321 - I almost did.\\
322 - Jackie, what the hell? Why
did you take everything down?\\
323 - You said,
"Take everything down."\\
324 - - Well, you didn't have to.
- You said, "You have to."\\
325 - - I didn't mean it.
- You said, "I mean it."\\
326 - - Look, just put it all back.
- Not until you admit
you loved it.\\
327 - Jackie, who cares
who's right or wrong here?\\
328 - Isn't the important thing
that you make me happy?\\
329 - Who are you talking to?
Do you even know me?\\
330 - Fine, I loved it.\\
331 - And?\\
332 - The twinkle lights
were breathtaking.\\
333 - And?\\
334 - The scented candles made
me feel like Laura Ingalls.\\
335 - All right, that's it.\\
336 - We need to find another
place to get married.\\
337 - I just wrote out, "You are
cordially invited to Mount Hump."\\
338 - And I died a little inside.\\
339 - Well, then, I guess
we should also rule out\\
340 - the scenic banks
of Nipple Creek.\\
341 - Where is Michael?\\
342 - You know, whenever he tells
me he has a surprise for me,\\
343 - it makes me a little nervous.\\
344 - Oh, it's probably just because
the last time he said that to you,\\
345 - you got pregnant.\\
346 - So what do you think?\\
347 - I think Barbie's
probably worried sick\\
348 - that her convertible's missing.\\
349 - I thought you were
getting another van.\\
350 - Oh, so did I, but then I saw this
baby down at the police auction\\
351 - and I knew it was
destined to be mine.\\
352 - Well, hey, man. Can I
give you some money?\\
353 - No, it was pretty cheap.
Some guy got stabbed in it.\\
354 - So nobody else bid on it.
It's pretty sweet, huh?\\
355 - It's freaking awesome!\\
356 - Is it the car or are you
more handsome?\\
357 - It's the car.\\
358 - And I'm more handsome.\\
359 - Michael, don't you think
it's a little impractical?\\
360 - Impractical?
More like, imperfecticable.\\
361 - I mean, this thing
is totally baby-friendly.\\
362 - Remind me again
how it's baby-friendly?\\
363 - 'Cause it's tiny
just like a baby.\\
364 - Barbie, you are gross,
but I still love you.\\
365 - Really?
Even though my face has melted off?\\
366 - Yes.\\
367 - But your perfect plastic boobs\\
368 - remain untouched jewels.\\
369 - Oh! Can my
twin sister watch?\\
370 - Why just watch? There's
plenty of Joe to go around.\\
371 - I didn't see you.
\subsection {Episode 12: Sally Simpson}
1 - Hey, guys.\\
2 - This is my co-cadet at the
Police Academy, Suzy Simpson.\\
3 - Simpson, these are my friends.\\
4 - Take a good look, 'cause
you'll probably be arresting\\
5 - some of them in the future.\\
6 - You're right!\\
7 - This one looks like the guy in the
"What Drugs Can Do to You" filmstrip.\\
8 - So you're a cop, huh?\\
9 - You don't look like a cop.\\
10 - You look kind of giggly.\\
11 - All right, Simpson needed
to give me a ride home,\\
12 - 'cause I sprayed myself with
mace to see what it'd feel like.\\
13 - Hey, so, Suzy, which
Charlie's Angel is your favorite?\\
14 - The brainy one?
The sporty one?\\
15 - Or the one that
just can't find a bra?\\
16 - Mine's the one that
just can't find a bra.\\
17 - Charlie's Angels are
an embarrassment to the badge.\\
18 - No real cop would last a day
dressed like those sluts.\\
19 - Hey!
Those sluts are my heroes!\\
20 - Hey, thanks for
giving me a ride, Simpson.\\
21 - We back up our own.\\
22 - Point Place Police
Corps Free Safe Streets!\\
23 - What's her problem
with Charlie's Angels?\\
24 - Ugh, I bet she watches PBS.\\
25 - So you and Simpson been friends
for almost two days now, huh?\\
26 - Isn't it about time
you got her pregnant?\\
27 - No! It's different
with me and Simpson.\\
28 - For the first time ever, I
have a girl that's just a friend.\\
29 - Like, when Simpson talks,
I actually listen\\
30 - instead of watching
her boobs go up and down.\\
31 - Kelso. You've finally
gotten past the stage\\
32 - where you have to look
at every woman's chest.\\
33 - Congratulations.\\
34 - Not exactly. I'm looking
at yours right now.\\
35 - And may I say,
congratulations to you.\\
36 - You're such a perv.\\
37 - And thank you.\\
38 - Oh, hey.\\
39 - What took you guys so long
at the heart doctor's?\\
40 - Oh, let me guess. You
had to call in a specialist\\
41 - just to find Dad's tiny heart.\\
42 - You know, we could call in a
specialist to find my foot in your ass.\\
43 - "We're going to need
an ass-foot-ologist, stat."\\
44 - Your father's blood pressure
is still high,\\
45 - and the doctor
can't figure out why.\\
46 - So he wants to send
some moron over\\
47 - to find the source of my stress.\\
48 - And I said,
"The source of my stress\\
49 - "is when you quacks
try to pad my medical bill."\\
50 - And then the machine went "Beep",
and the appointment was over.\\
51 - You know, I don't know
what you're so worried about.\\
52 - They're just going to blame me.\\
53 - Shrinks love to blame the wife.\\
54 - What do they know?
They're barely doctors.\\
55 - A stuffed animal and a box
of tissues could do their job.\\
56 - Why is Red so stressed?\\
57 - It's a mystery.\\
58 - Just like when Nancy Drew
had to figure out\\
59 - why the man in the clock tower
was so mean to his cat.\\
60 - What did she find out?\\
61 - Oh, I don't know,
books are too long.\\
62 - Hanging out\\
63 - Down the street\\
64 - The same old thing\\
65 - We did last week\\
66 - Not a thing to do\\
67 - But talk to you\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - We're all all right\\
70 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
71 - Hi! I'm the stress management
specialist, Stuart\\
72 - - Sutcliffe.
- Sutcliffe!\\
73 - You played tight
end for the Packers!\\
74 - Yeah, till I bent
my knee sideways.\\
75 - Actually, that happened to me
in the school musical.\\
76 - I was a dancing mushroom.\\
77 - Anyway, long story short...\\
78 - I finished the number.\\
79 - This is my son, Eric.\\
80 - Oh, oh,\\
81 - and I am his loving,
relaxing wife, Kitty.\\
82 - How about that.\\
83 - A real, live Packer
in the house.\\
84 - Well, I hope the fact
that you both love sports\\
85 - doesn't mean that anyone,
like, say, his wife\\
86 - would be judged unfairly.
I mean, I love sports, so...\\
87 - So don't start me off
with four strikes\\
88 - in the last quarter
of the Super Series!\\
89 - No, no. Today I'm
just a neutral observer\\
90 - with a degree in Family
Therapy and Alcohol Awareness.\\
91 - So, Dad, you can talk
to him about sports,\\
92 - and, Mom, you can
talk to him about drinking.\\
93 - Oh, pooh!\\
94 - I was instructed by the doctor to
have the occasional medicinal cocktail.\\
95 - I have a note.\\
96 - Red, how do you feel
about Kitty's drinking?\\
97 - Makes things easier.\\
98 - But drinking often adds a
lot of stress to a household.\\
99 - If you will excuse me, I'd rather not
stay here and listen to you blame me.\\
100 - Mother hater!\\
101 - Well, I hope nobody minds
if I record today's session.\\
102 - Yay, this is your
lucky day, son.\\
103 - They say
the camera adds 15 pounds.\\
104 - Really?\\
105 - I heard it also adds
a full head of hair.\\
106 - Hey, Kitty. You busy?\\
107 - No. Red and I are just
having our marriage dissected\\
108 - by a teetotaling know-it-all!\\
109 - Oh. Then is now a good time
to tell Red I broke his chainsaw?\\
110 - No, he'll be furious with you.\\
111 - Yes. He will be furious
with you!\\
112 - Come with me.\\
113 - So then,
all the mushrooms jitterbug.\\
114 - Stuart, Stuart.\\
115 - This is Bob, the stress causer.\\
116 - Bob broke Red's chainsaw.\\
117 - Bob, meet Stuart.
Stuart, blame Bob.\\
118 - Red, how do you feel about Bob?\\
119 - Does he cause you stress?\\
120 - Not really.
Bob's just kind of goofy.\\
121 - Like a cartoon. Like
living next to Elmer Fudd.\\
122 - That may be the nicest thing
you've ever said about me.\\
123 - You wascal.\\
124 - Oh, so, fine.\\
125 - Now you're best friends.
Now everyone's all happy,\\
126 - and I look like the crazy one,\\
127 - just yelling and screaming in
the middle of the living room.\\
128 - Well, I am not the crazy one,\\
129 - even though I am yelling and
screaming in the middle of the living room!\\
130 - Is that a camera?\\
131 - Yes. I'm
recording today's session.\\
132 - Well, isn't that just
something I didn't know.\\
133 - Michael. We got issued
our cop sunglasses.\\
134 - I've been using them to scare
the crap out of civilians all day.\\
135 - Drop the records, punk!\\
136 - I wasn't stealing them.\\
137 - Yes, I was.\\
138 - Fez, this is Suzy Simpson.
She and I are training to be cops.\\
139 - Oh, if there's more like you
at the Police Academy,\\
140 - that Academy deserves an award.\\
141 - Academy Award, that's funny.\\
142 - Yeah, Simpson's wanted
to be a cop for, like, forever.\\
143 - Yeah, it's because of
the weapons, mostly.\\
144 - I love things that
make a lot of noise.\\
145 - Guns and boys.\\
146 - Well, then, load me up, baby,
'cause I'm ready to go bang.\\
147 - Well, I'd better go. I've
gotta stop at the candy store.\\
148 - - All right.
- Wait.\\
149 - You like candy?\\
150 - Yeah. I'm out of
Good & Plenty.\\
151 - It says on the box
that there's plenty,\\
152 - - but it's never enough.
- But it's never enough.\\
153 - Jinx! One, two, three, four,
five, you owe me a Coke!\\
154 - That is the woman I've been
searching for my whole life.\\
155 - Hey, do you want me
to see if she likes you?\\
156 - Kelso, we've been
down that road.\\
157 - Just give me her address,
some binoculars,\\
158 - and I'll handle the rest myself.\\
159 - Now, while we're filming,\\
160 - let's just pretend the
camera's not even here.\\
161 - Now, you're going to interact, I'm
going to write down my observations.\\
162 - While you're writing down stuff,\\
163 - would you mind
autographing this football?\\
164 - It's brand-new,
kid never touched it.\\
165 - Hey, what's going on?\\
166 - Dude, we're on TV.\\
167 - Does this thing work?\\
168 - Hey, Steven, point it at me.\\
169 - Good morning, Dallas!\\
170 - I'm Jackie Sunshine
with your morning weather!\\
171 - It is going to be sunny today,\\
172 - so you ladies who let yourselves
go this winter, stay inside\\
173 - and leave the fellows
to us pretty girls.\\
174 - Please stop touching my camera.\\
175 - Well, what a lovely day here\\
176 - in the household of the Formans.\\
177 - I can't say there's
a place I'd rather be\\
178 - than with these kinds of
people in this kind of place.\\
179 - What are you,\\
180 - Scarlett O'Hara, now?\\
181 - I am being
soft and gracious. Now, clam it!\\
182 - Mom, you know,
they have talkies now.\\
183 - Oh, forget it.\\
184 - I give up. Where is the
off button on this thing?\\
185 - Mrs. Forman, I need
to see things as they happen!\\
186 - This silly... Oopsie!\\
187 - All right, you clock this lady
doing 38 in a 35 zone.\\
188 - Recite it and write it.\\
189 - License and registration, ma'am.\\
190 - Use the glasses,
they're powerful.\\
191 - It's like a gun you
wear on your face.\\
192 - Licence and registration, ma'am.\\
193 - Oh, that felt good.\\
194 - Guess what?\\
195 - I know someone who likes you\\
196 - and thinks that you're cute
and smart and funny.\\
197 - Well, I think I know
who you're talking about\\
198 - and I like him, too.\\
199 - Well, what do you
like about him?\\
200 - I like how hot he looks
sitting across from me\\
201 - in a blue t-shirt
eating a hot dog.\\
202 - You just described me.\\
203 - Oh, crap.\\
204 - Man, I thought Simpson
was different.\\
205 - She's supposed to
just be my buddy.\\
206 - Now I'm going to
have to sleep with her.\\
207 - No, Michael, no.
Set her up with Fez.\\
208 - He's the one who likes her.\\
209 - Yeah, Fez needs something, man.\\
210 - The guy's so desperate,\\
211 - he's been rubbing himself
around the couch like a cat.\\
212 - What you need to do is put them
together in a romantic situation.\\
213 - Suzy may not like Fez at first,\\
214 - but he won't take
"No" for an answer.\\
215 - He's like one freaky,
horny little dude.\\
216 - Just ask the couch.\\
217 - Hey, I was thinking
maybe tomorrow\\
218 - you could help me brush
up on my target practice.\\
219 - It's a date.\\
220 - Yeah, I'd be there,
you'd be there...\\
221 - On a date.\\
222 - So, I'll see you at
the shooting range.\\
223 - For our date.\\
224 - Your first date
with Suzy's all set up,\\
225 - and she told me
that she's crazy about you.\\
226 - Well, I'd like to say
I'm surprised,\\
227 - but I'm a little
crazy about me, too!\\
228 - Well, it's all set.\\
229 - Fez is going on
a date with Suzy,\\
230 - who's going on a date with me,
and doesn't know\\
231 - she's going on a date with Fez.\\
232 - I'm ready for our date, Michael.\\
233 - I'm ready for our date, Suzy.\\
234 - - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.\\
235 - Such a shame you won't
be able to film anymore.\\
236 - Look, there's one last
exercise I want to try.\\
237 - Role-playing.
All right, go.\\
238 - All right. Now,
you're going to be Eric.\\
239 - Eric, you're going
to be your father.\\
240 - Mr. Forman,
you can start.\\
241 - Well...\\
242 - I'm just a skinny,
smart-mouthed kid\\
243 - who always has something
to say about everything.\\
244 - And I wish I was an octopus\\
245 - so I could put eight feet
in eight different asses!\\
246 - Star Wars, Star Wars, Star Wars!\\
247 - Dead commies, dead commies,
dead commies!\\
248 - All right, time out, time out!\\
249 - I think I know
what the problem is.\\
250 - All right, fine.
I drink a little.\\
251 - What?\\
252 - I have a very difficult job, and I
come home at night, and, well...\\
253 - Drinks are her nightly reward.\\
254 - Mrs. Forman,\\
255 - I believe the source of
your husband's stress is...\\
256 - Oh, here it comes.\\
257 - ...your son.\\
258 - - Him?
- Me?\\
259 - It's not me?
Oh, boy!\\
260 - You think my problem
is my own son?\\
261 - My son is a fine young man.\\
262 - - Wow, Dad, you don't have...
- Shut up, dumb ass.\\
263 - You know less about my family
than you do about football!\\
264 - Which isn't saying much,\\
265 - since you dropped every
pass that came near you!\\
266 - And let me tell
you something else.\\
267 - When a real
Packer hurts his leg,\\
268 - he stuffs his kneecap back in
and keeps on running!\\
269 - That's what this little
mushroom would have done.\\
270 - I love this place.\\
271 - The sweet smell of gunpowder,\\
272 - the deafening boom
of shotgun blasts...\\
273 - Oops. That kind of talk's more
appropriate for the bedroom. I apologize.\\
274 - Knock, knock?\\
275 - Who's there? Ivan! Ivan who?\\
276 - Ivan awful lot of
candy for the both of us!\\
277 - Fez?\\
278 - Well, if it's not me, then there's some
lucky bastard who looks just like me.\\
279 - Michael, I thought it was just going
to be you, me and a box of hot lead!\\
280 - Well, it's even better.\\
281 - It's you, me
and a box of hot Fez.\\
282 - Kelso, this wasn't
part of the deal.\\
283 - What wasn't part of the deal?\\
284 - You! So beat it.\\
285 - I want her to smell
nothing but me.\\
286 - Okay.\\
287 - You know what,
I'm kind of in the way.\\
288 - I'm going to go next door,\\
289 - and maybe you can
show Fez how to shoot.\\
290 - Try to close the deal before
she realizes you're a foreigner.\\
291 - So, where do we start?\\
292 - I could rifle
through the manual,\\
293 - but why don't you just
give me the bullet points?\\
294 - Fez, I never joke about guns.\\
295 - Oh. Shoot.\\
296 - I have no discipline.\\
297 - Okay.\\
298 - You're gonna just take aim\\
299 - and squeeze gently.\\
300 - Here, put these on
and take a few shots.\\
301 - I'm just going to go check
on Michael so he's not alone.\\
302 - Cologne?\\
303 - Oh, yeah, I mixed
a bunch of different ones\\
304 - and, you know,
I make my own scent.\\
305 - Hey, Michael.\\
306 - Do you want me to hold your
shoulders while you shoot,\\
307 - or maybe square off your thighs?\\
308 - You know whose thighs
need squaring off?\\
309 - Fez's.\\
310 - Yeah, bad.\\
311 - Oh, and by the way,\\
312 - he also told me that
he thinks you're really nice.\\
313 - Oh, well, he's nice, too.\\
314 - And now that I can understand
some of what he's saying,\\
315 - he's kind of charming.\\
316 - Oh, look, a rabbit.\\
317 - I love animals.\\
318 - You know who
really loves animals?\\
319 - Fez.\\
320 - - He does?
- Yeah.\\
321 - The bunny!\\
322 - I got dinner!\\
323 - And then my dad actually
gave me a compliment.\\
324 - "My son's a
fine young man."\\
325 - That's, like, the most loving thing
he's said to me since he told me that\\
326 - I could be worse.\\
327 - Are you sure Red
was talking about you?\\
328 - I mean, I love you, but you
are a little high maintenance.\\
329 - And not in a good way like me.\\
330 - Remember when it took Red all
summer to teach you how to catch a ball\\
331 - 'cause you were
too scared of it?\\
332 - First, Red had him
look at a picture of a ball.\\
333 - Then he put him in
a room with a ball.\\
334 - And then he moves him closer\\
335 - until he wasn't screaming
being right next to the ball.\\
336 - What is so scary about a ball?\\
337 - It's that... People throw
it right at you, okay?\\
338 - I'm sorry about what I did
to that poor bunny.\\
339 - I guess my gun really had
a "hare" trigger, huh?\\
340 - Too soon?
Yes, too soon.\\
341 - Well, I apologize for
ruining our first date.\\
342 - Our first date?\\
343 - No, I was there on
a date with Michael.\\
344 - What? No, no, he told me
we were on a date.\\
345 - He told me we were on a date.\\
346 - You and me "we,"
or he and you "we"?\\
347 - I think one of us
has been lied to.\\
348 - And the other one, too!\\
349 - Well, then, you should be
very angry, which means\\
350 - I am, too!\\
351 - Hey, why don't you
two kiss and make up?\\
352 - Michael, what kind of game
are you playing,\\
353 - inviting me on a date
that wasn't with you?\\
354 - Yeah, I second that,
but about her,\\
355 - and add,
"You son of a bitch!"\\
356 - Okay, look, I have a really
good explanation for this.\\
357 - But I left it at home.\\
358 - Oh, Dad.\\
359 - Uh, about what you said to
the stress management guy.\\
360 - I just wanted to say thanks.\\
361 - Okay, okay.
You said it.\\
362 - We're both embarrassed,
now move along.\\
363 - No, I mean, look, I could be
a little less of a smart ass.\\
364 - And you're my father.\\
365 - Your life matters to me.\\
366 - - So, anyway, Dad, I...
- Eric,\\
367 - If you say "I love you,"
my heart is going to explode.\\
368 - Ah, kitty, uh,
what's for dinner?\\
369 - Well, the camera's off,\\
370 - so I'm having
a margarita with salt.\\
371 - You two are on your own.\\
372 - Kelso.\\
373 - So, this is where you go after
a hard day of screwing me over!\\
374 - All right, look,
Fez, I'm really sorry.\\
375 - Zip it, fool!\\
376 - You stole my girl.\\
377 - And I really need a girl.\\
378 - Here, Fez.\\
379 - You're probably going to want
some personal time with the couch.\\
380 - I even plumped up
the pillows for you.\\
381 - No, I cannot be
in the same room with him.\\
382 - You and I are through.\\
383 - Now good day.\\
384 - But, Fez...\\
385 - Fez? He said,
"But, Fez."\\
386 - Oh, I heard him.\\
387 - Well, now you're
supposed to say...\\
388 - "I say good day."\\
389 - Yeah, and then we all know
that you're really mad,\\
390 - but eventually,
you'll get over it.\\
391 - Oh, you'd like that.\\
392 - "Dance, monkey, dance."\\
393 - Well, Kelso, this monkey
don't dance no more.\\
394 - But, Fez...\\
395 - I said, "Good day!"
Arrrh!\\
396 - Wow, Fez, it was so nice
of you to make dinner for us.\\
397 - Yeah, this is amazing.\\
398 - Well, food always tastes
better when it's fresh.\\
399 - So, what is this, anyway?\\
400 - Well, let's just say that the
Easter Bunny came early this year,\\
401 - so I shot him.
\subsection {Episode 13: Won't Get Fooled Again}
1 - So, Fez thought
he was on a date with Suzy,\\
2 - and he shot
a rabbit to impress her.\\
3 - Doesn't he know he could've
just bought her flowers?\\
4 - Oh! I would die if
you got me flowers.\\
5 - You'd be lucky to
get a dead rabbit.\\
6 - Suzy, why would Fez think
you'd like a dead rabbit?\\
7 - Are you from
the South or something?\\
8 - No, I think he did it because he
knows that as a cop, I like to spill blood.\\
9 - But I wanna hurt people,
not animals.\\
10 - You know what?
This is my fault.\\
11 - I never should have told Fez that
you liked him when you liked me.\\
12 - If only there was something I
could do to make him feel better.\\
13 - - I have an idea.
- Oh, good.\\
14 - Kelso's gonna make it worse now.\\
15 - No, just let Fez take you to dinner,
and then for dessert, do it with him.\\
16 - - No way.
- Okay, look.\\
17 - If you do me this favor,
I'll buy you a new gun.\\
18 - That would make her a hooker.\\
19 - No, hookers do it for money,
this would be for a gun.\\
20 - Hey, I have standards.\\
21 - I mean, if it's sleeping with a suspect
to extract some information, fine.\\
22 - Or posing as a prostitute for
a quickie in the back of a car\\
23 - to snare some John, sure.\\
24 - But, jeez, Michael, what
kind of girl do you think I am?\\
25 - Hello, Suzy.\\
26 - I'd love to stand here and stare
at you until you get uncomfortable,\\
27 - but I have
a relationship to end.\\
28 - Kelso, here's
everything you ever gave me.\\
29 - I don't want it anymore.\\
30 - Look, Fez,
you don't have to do this.\\
31 - Yeah, Fez, when you
split up with someone,\\
32 - you don't have to
give stuff back.\\
33 - You wait until they leave the house,
take everything they care about\\
34 - and break the rest.\\
35 - That way, they have nothing.\\
36 - Lucky for me,
I already have nothing.\\
37 - Oh, you can have less.\\
38 - The point is that I don't
want anything you gave me.\\
39 - I never gave you my yo-yo.\\
40 - So I took it.\\
41 - And I tangled the string, too.\\
42 - Let's see you walk the
dog now, you son of a bitch.\\
43 - Are those new
birth control pills?\\
44 - Let the doing it...\\
45 - commence.\\
46 - Do you have to do
that every time?\\
47 - Donna, if I had the money,
I'd take out an ad in the paper.\\
48 - Oh, no.\\
49 - No, no, no, no, no, no.\\
50 - Never say, "Oh, no," when you're
talking about birth control pills.\\
51 - Anything's
better than, "Oh, no."\\
52 - I forgot to take one.\\
53 - Except that. Oh, God.\\
54 - Oh, God. Oh, my God.\\
55 - One minute, my life's all
light and breezy, and the next,\\
56 - I'm shackled to
you and some kid.\\
57 - Oh, my God.\\
58 - Oh, my God,
my heart is pounding so hard,\\
59 - like in the cartoons when
Daisy Duck sees Donald Duck,\\
60 - and her heart goes boom, boom!\\
61 - But that was a happy thing,\\
62 - and this is 'cause you couldn't
keep your dirty hands off me!\\
63 - Okay, okay, come on, let's...
Let's think.\\
64 - Hey, there's only
a couple of times a month\\
65 - something like this
can happen, right?\\
66 - Maybe there's some kind of
time-related loophole.\\
67 - Hey, did we spring
forward or fall back?\\
68 - When we did it? I don't know.\\
69 - I don't know what you'd call
it, but it's the same every time.\\
70 - Well, I can't be that bad,
Donna. I got you pregnant!\\
71 - Hanging out\\
72 - Down the street\\
73 - The same old thing\\
74 - We did last week\\
75 - Not a thing to do\\
76 - But talk to you\\
77 - We're all all right\\
78 - We're all all right\\
79 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
80 - Eric, I can't believe
you knocked up a girl, too.\\
81 - I mean, you lose points for
not doing it in a public place,\\
82 - but, hey, give me five.\\
83 - Kelso, I don't really think this is
a "give me five" moment, okay?\\
84 - I am really freaked out.\\
85 - Well, right now, I'm not so
much freaked out as starving\\
86 - and fascinated by your nose.\\
87 - Yeah, it's perfect.\\
88 - And you'd be amazed
at what I can fit up in there.\\
89 - But the important thing is that
you have responsibilities now.\\
90 - So,
you gotta step up like I did.\\
91 - Look, if you mean
you stepped up on a urinal\\
92 - to climb out of a window to get
away from the girl you got pregnant,\\
93 - then, yeah, you stepped up.\\
94 - Still no Fez, huh?\\
95 - Wow, Kelso, you really must
have pissed him off.\\
96 - He hasn't stayed away this long
since he discovered bubble baths.\\
97 - Yeah, Fez still
isn't talking to me.\\
98 - But I think he's calling,\\
99 - 'cause every once in a while, I pick
up the phone and all I hear is breathing\\
100 - and the crinkle of a candy
being unwrapped.\\
101 - Man, we are sitting in the
circle talking about relationships.\\
102 - What happened to us?\\
103 - This stash must
be from California.\\
104 - Oh, hey, Donna.\\
105 - Any news? Come on,
that time of the month.\\
106 - No, nothing yet.\\
107 - Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up.\\
108 - I told you we should
have gone to Denny's.\\
109 - Oh, yeah, Donna, let's not talk about
throwing up in front of the customers.\\
110 - Ma'am, here's your creamed corn.\\
111 - I got no interest
in getting a lady pregnant.\\
112 - That's why I'm celibate.\\
113 - I thought it was because
no one would do it with you.\\
114 - Well, that's like
a secondary reason.\\
115 - Look, Donna, we're
gonna figure this out, okay?\\
116 - Hey, you know what?
We can ask my mom.\\
117 - - She's a nurse. She loves this stuff.
- Mmm-mmm.\\
118 - Well, at least once a week
she gives a talk about her uterus.\\
119 - Eric, I don't want
your mom to know.\\
120 - Donna's right. There's no reason
to let too many people know just yet.\\
121 - Who have you told so far?\\
122 - Well, just my friends\\
123 - and this nice couple.\\
124 - Okay, look, so I'll just tell
you what my mom says, okay?\\
125 - Okay, just make sure she doesn't
know you're talking about us.\\
126 - Tell her you have a friend,\\
127 - a Canadian friend, who lives
in an igloo so she can't call her.\\
128 - Donna, I think I
know how to be subtle.\\
129 - Mommy, Mommy,
Donna might be pregnant!\\
130 - Did she trap you? We'll move
you away. We won't play her game.\\
131 - No. No, it's nothing like that.
It's just, I had to tell someone.\\
132 - Hey, promise me
you won't say anything to Dad.\\
133 - Fine, I promise.\\
134 - Oh, this is all my fault.\\
135 - I should never have been
intimate with your father\\
136 - while you were in
the crib next to the bed.\\
137 - Hey, Fez.\\
138 - Look, I don't think
he wants to make up.\\
139 - Well, try anyway.\\
140 - I got your back,\\
141 - your strong, muscular back.\\
142 - Fez, look, I got you some candy\\
143 - and a Playboy\\
144 - and a six-pack.\\
145 - So...\\
146 - You can use them in
whatever order you want.\\
147 - Tell him what they're for.\\
148 - In a tense standoff, you need to
make the perp think you're on his side,\\
149 - even if you're about
to put a bullet in his head.\\
150 - Don't worry, we're not.\\
151 - They're a peace offering.\\
152 - Well...\\
153 - Look at the American trying
to buy his way out of trouble.\\
154 - Fez, give Michael a chance.\\
155 - You know what?
No, Simpson, forget it.\\
156 - Fez, you're the one
that blew it with Suzy, okay?\\
157 - I didn't know you were gonna
shoot a defenseless rabbit.\\
158 - Well, if you didn't know that,
then you never knew me at all.\\
159 - Whatever.\\
160 - You know what? I don't
care if you're mad at me,\\
161 - 'cause now I'm mad at you!\\
162 - Fine! Well, you can keep your stupid
gifts, because now I don't want them!\\
163 - If you must know,
it will be this, then this.\\
164 - So, you knocked up
the neighbor girl?\\
165 - Oh, my God.\\
166 - You should have been
thinking a little more about God\\
167 - before you got into this mess.\\
168 - He would've stopped
you at first base.\\
169 - Mom, you promised
you wouldn't say anything.\\
170 - And I didn't, I wrote it down.\\
171 - So, you're pregnant.\\
172 - Okay, well...\\
173 - Okay, we'll move
the wedding to next month,\\
174 - and then nine months later,\\
175 - we'll tell people the baby
came early because you smoked.\\
176 - No, I don't wanna
move the wedding up.\\
177 - Don't we get a say in this?\\
178 - Red, say something.\\
179 - Donna, he's not gonna help us.\\
180 - Right now he's
trying to figure out\\
181 - how to get both of his feet in both
of our asses without leaving his chair.\\
182 - Stop being weird.\\
183 - We'll just have to
make the best of this.\\
184 - Besides,
with Donna for a mother,\\
185 - there's a decent chance
the kid will be good at sports.\\
186 - Well, Donna, I think you're too young
to be a mother, so here's what we do.\\
187 - Tell the kid you're his sister,\\
188 - Midge and I are the parents, and
when he turns 18, tell him we lied.\\
189 - Probably get a good chuckle
out of the whole thing.\\
190 - Eric, a little help.\\
191 - Okay, you guys...\\
192 - Okay, whether
we're pregnant or not,\\
193 - - we can run our
own lives, okay?
- Yeah.\\
194 - And you know what?
It would have been great\\
195 - if Donna could have had a
career, but things change.\\
196 - So, you know... Fine, so,
you'll stay home with the baby.\\
197 - Whoa.\\
198 - What?\\
199 - So, I don't get a career?\\
200 - Well, you know, you could
sell Tupperware or something.\\
201 - Okay, you can just get bent.\\
202 - What...
Oh, come on, what did I say?\\
203 - That wasn't so bad, was it?\\
204 - No, I would love a
Tupperware lady in the family.\\
205 - Oh, hey, Jackie, have you
seen Donna? Is she okay?\\
206 - Well, she wanted me
to tell you a secret.\\
207 - - Okay.
- Ow!\\
208 - Hey, guys.
Ooh, what stinks out here?\\
209 - It must be this big,
girl-stealing turd.\\
210 - All right, that's it.\\
211 - - Let's go.
- Oh, I will slap you silly.\\
212 - Oh!\\
213 - Stop.\\
214 - Hey, look,
Jackie's right, all right?\\
215 - If you guys are gonna fight,\\
216 - let's go inside where there's
more stuff to hit your head on.\\
217 - Come on, you guys,
lots of couples fight,\\
218 - but there's
an easy way to fix this.\\
219 - Just decide
which one of you is the woman,\\
220 - and the other
one just apologize.\\
221 - No, I don't wanna
make up with Kelso.\\
222 - I wanna make fun of Kelso.\\
223 - Hey, guys,
what's up with Kelso? Stupid.\\
224 - Hey, guys, what's up with Fez?
Foreign.\\
225 - Okay, you guys,
this is getting pretty lame.\\
226 - Let's split into two groups.\\
227 - Good idea. Boys and girls.\\
228 - - Let's go, Jackie.
- What?\\
229 - - How you doing, kid?
- Fine.\\
230 - I don't know.\\
231 - Scared.\\
232 - Just know that whether you're pregnant
or not, you're still my little girl.\\
233 - I support you.\\
234 - Thanks, Dad.\\
235 - But if you are pregnant,
don't let Red touch the baby.\\
236 - He thinks he's tickling,
but he just pokes.\\
237 - Trust me,
I know from experience.\\
238 - Well, Dad, maybe Red
wasn't trying to tickle you.\\
239 - Maybe he was trying to poke you.\\
240 - Why would Red poke me?\\
241 - Why would he tickle you?\\
242 - Fez,
since you're mad at Michael,\\
243 - shouldn't you be cutting
his head out of those pictures\\
244 - instead of your head?\\
245 - Well, I can't do that. Have you
seen how well he photographs?\\
246 - Fez, I can't believe you're
gonna let it end this way.\\
247 - I always thought
you and Michael would make it.\\
248 - Well, we look good in public,\\
249 - but you weren't
there for the bad times.\\
250 - Like, he never noticed
when I got a new outfit.\\
251 - Look, Fez, just do what
I did to get over Michael.\\
252 - Make out with Hyde?\\
253 - No,
just stop thinking about him.\\
254 - I can't.\\
255 - Even The Hub reminds me of him.\\
256 - I remember this one day,\\
257 - it was the only day
The Hub ever had Tater Tots.\\
258 - And there was this
really big Tater Tot,\\
259 - and I'll never forget
what Kelso said. He said,\\
260 - "That's not a Tater Tot,
that's a Tater Giant."\\
261 - Oh, how we laughed.\\
262 - Fez, Michael took
me for granted, too,\\
263 - but I found someone better,
and so will you.\\
264 - Yeah, don't end it all now.
You have so much to live for.\\
265 - That's what we say when we're
trying to talk down a jumper.\\
266 - I guess it doesn't
really apply here.\\
267 - You know, I'm glad
Fez is out of my life.\\
268 - Always with the mood swings.\\
269 - I'd ask what's wrong, and
all I'd hear was, "Nothing."\\
270 - And then, the minute I
wanna watch the game,\\
271 - suddenly it's time
to talk about our feelings.\\
272 - Women.\\
273 - Actually,
we're talking about a man.\\
274 - Oh, you guys are progressive.\\
275 - But the thing is, I know I
didn't do anything wrong,\\
276 - but where am I gonna find
another friend like Fez?\\
277 - Look, man, there are plenty of
other fish in the sea, okay?\\
278 - It's like when you and Jackie
broke up. It was for the best.\\
279 - And after a while,
she found someone better.\\
280 - Me.\\
281 - And since then, I've enjoyed throwing
that in your face as often as possible.\\
282 - What was your question again?\\
283 - Oh, my God, great news!\\
284 - Donna's not pregnant.\\
285 - She's not talking to me,
and she kind of hung up on me,\\
286 - but that click and dead silence was
the most beautiful sound I ever heard.\\
287 - Well, what a relief.\\
288 - But you and I are still having a
good long talk about the uterus.\\
289 - Man, dodged a bullet there, huh?\\
290 - Almost had a little... A little dumb
ass running around here, huh?\\
291 - I'm gonna go throw up now.\\
292 - You know, you have been
awfully calm about this whole thing.\\
293 - You haven't threatened to put
a foot in anyone's rear all day.\\
294 - Well, I...\\
295 - I guess I was kind of looking
forward to having a grandkid.\\
296 - I mean, since my heart attack,
I've realized that life is short,\\
297 - and it would be... It would be nice
to know my grandkids before I go.\\
298 - Oh, that's so sweet.\\
299 - Well, you know,
if you're really disappointed,\\
300 - we could always ask Laurie.\\
301 - She might have a few kids
we don't know about.\\
302 - Simpson, I'm here. Where
is the cat on the trampoline?\\
303 - Sorry, Michael, there is no cat.\\
304 - Is there at least a trampoline?\\
305 - Please, have a seat.\\
306 - Tater Tots.\\
307 - You know, the last time The
Hub had Tater Tots was when...\\
308 - Suzy, I got your message.
Where's that bouncing kitty?\\
309 - What's he doing here?\\
310 - Okay, I've called you here because
it's time you two talked things over.\\
311 - And I've used Tater Tots to recreate
one of your happiest times together.\\
312 - Oh, look,
there's a really big one.\\
313 - That's not a Tater Tot,
that's a Tater Giant.\\
314 - I look at your jumbo
Tot and I feel nothing.\\
315 - I, too, resist your Tot.\\
316 - Oh, come on.\\
317 - Michael,
Fez is a great guy, he's...\\
318 - He's loyal and
sweet and innocent.\\
319 - And Fez, Michael's great, too.\\
320 - He's pure and strong\\
321 - and more man than I've
ever seen in one pair of pants.\\
322 - Hey, he's not so pure.\\
323 - He's expecting a baby
with another woman.\\
324 - What?\\
325 - Well, he's not so innocent.
He's married.\\
326 - What?\\
327 - Oh, my God,
you're both disgusting!\\
328 - I don't want either one of you.\\
329 - And you really missed out,
because I spent a semester in France,\\
330 - and I do stuff
American girls think is gross.\\
331 - Whoa, what was that about?\\
332 - Yeah, she's flipping out
'cause someone she likes\\
333 - is married or having
an illegitimate child.\\
334 - What's she gonna do
when there's real trouble?\\
335 - - Yeah,
we're better off without her.
- Yeah.\\
336 - Wait. We?\\
337 - Ah.\\
338 - I guess I've missed you.\\
339 - Really? Man,
'cause I've missed you, too.\\
340 - Well, I wasn't trying to steal
her. I wanted her to be with you.\\
341 - That's okay, I'd rather
have my friend back anyway.\\
342 - Do you wanna...\\
343 - I do if you do.\\
344 - I do.\\
345 - Reunited and
it feels so good\\
346 - Reunited
'cause we understood\\
347 - There's one perfect fit\\
348 - And, sugar, this one is it\\
349 - We both are so excited\\
350 - 'Cause we're reunited,
hey, hey\\
351 - We are so lucky.\\
352 - I mean, it's obvious
we're not ready to be parents.\\
353 - What would we do?\\
354 - Hey, anything you want.\\
355 - And by the way, when I said
you could sell Tupperware,\\
356 - that was just, like, code for,\\
357 - "You could be President
of the United States."\\
358 - I don't believe you, but
I'm too relieved to be mad.\\
359 - I'll probably bring it up when we're
having a fight about something else.\\
360 - Listen, Donna, all I know is we
can never make this mistake again.\\
361 - Yeah, don't worry,
I think we learned our lesson.\\
362 - Hurry up, Donna, you're... You're
cutting into your foreplay time.\\
363 - One second.\\
364 - - Oh, no!
- What, what?\\
365 - Just kidding.\\
366 - That's not funny, Donna.\\
367 - I can't even do it now.\\
368 - Yes, I can.\\
369 - What would a French girl do that
an American girl would think is gross?\\
370 - It could be anything.
They eat snails.\\
371 - Hey, maybe it's foot stuff.\\
372 - Foot stuff?
What would you do to a foot?\\
373 - I don't know, like,\\
374 - lick it or something?\\
375 - What is wrong with you?\\
376 - What are you,
some kind of foot-licker?\\
377 - No! I wouldn't lick.
I would get licked.\\
378 - Oh, God! Why did I say that?
\subsection {Episode 14: Baby Don't You Do It}
1 - It's been, like, an hour\\
2 - and my dad is still upstairs
talking to your folks.\\
3 - Our pregnancy scare must have
really freaked them out.\\
4 - Yeah, well,
that's because "pregnancy"\\
5 - is one of the scariest words
in the English language.\\
6 - Right after
"monster" and "broccoli."\\
7 - Well, I'm not pregnant.\\
8 - Everything's fine, so I'm sure
our parents will calm down soon.\\
9 - Hey, fornicators, upstairs!\\
10 - Oh, God, we're dead.
You know what?\\
11 - None of this would have happened if
you hadn't insisted on sleeping with me.\\
12 - I insisted?\\
13 - You wouldn't give
me my wallet back.\\
14 - Look, we're in this together.\\
15 - You were there, too.\\
16 - Or was I?\\
17 - The Jedi mind trick
doesn't work in real life, dink.\\
18 - Or does it?\\
19 - Oh, hey, what's shaking, gang?\\
20 - Certainly not Donna's belly
from being pregnant, right?\\
21 - You're not funny,
you're a sinner.\\
22 - Now, sit.\\
23 - We have decided that you two
need premarital counseling at church.\\
24 - Premarital?
Counseling? Church?\\
25 - Why am I talking
like a Speak & Spell?\\
26 - Dad, you think
this is a good idea?\\
27 - No. I suggested
we get him fixed like a dog.\\
28 - Counseling can be
extremely beneficial.\\
29 - I knew two boys who were
about to marry their sweethearts.\\
30 - One boy went to counseling
and one didn't.\\
31 - And the one who didn't go
to counseling died.\\
32 - I'll tell you, if Midge
and I had counseling,\\
33 - it might have
saved our marriage.\\
34 - Of course, not sleeping with
degenerates from the pool hall\\
35 - would have helped, too.\\
36 - So, you want us to
go to counseling?\\
37 - Mom, where do you even come up
with this stuff?\\
38 - It wasn't my idea.\\
39 - Steven was thoughtful enough
to suggest it.\\
40 - You're welcome.\\
41 - Hanging out\\
42 - Down the street\\
43 - The same old thing\\
44 - We did last week\\
45 - Not a thing to do\\
46 - But talk to you\\
47 - We're all all right\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
50 - Okay, you guys, this church
counseling idea is really crappy.\\
51 - Would you listen to the
language on this kid?\\
52 - What he needs is church,
and lots of it.\\
53 - You know, Eric, you may not
think that you need counseling,\\
54 - but maybe Donna does.\\
55 - No, she doesn't.\\
56 - Well, actually, I think
counseling might help us\\
57 - work through some of our
issues before we get married.\\
58 - We don't have issues.\\
59 - - Yes, we do. Do.
- No, we don't. Don't.\\
60 - Okay, see?\\
61 - You don't do the "do, don't" if you
don't have issues, which you do.\\
62 - Okay, Dad, how can you
think this is a good idea?\\
63 - You always say to take care
of family business at home.\\
64 - I am taking care
of business at home.\\
65 - Because if you
two don't do this,\\
66 - do you know what it's going to
be like living with your mother?\\
67 - Just more of
a delight every day, is what.\\
68 - Well, come on, Eric. We'll
learn stuff about each other.\\
69 - For instance, what if one day I
get a high-paying job in California?\\
70 - - Will you move?
- Whoa.\\
71 - Why can't I get
the high-paying job?\\
72 - Okay, what if you get a
high-paying job? Will I move?\\
73 - No, who am I kidding? I'm
not getting a high-paying job.\\
74 - All right, civilians.\\
75 - Hide your stashes. Officer-in-training
Kelso's back from the Academy.\\
76 - I've got to be honest, man.\\
77 - Every day you come home
with all your fingers,\\
78 - I die a little inside.\\
79 - Michael,
you got another D on a test?\\
80 - Is this your fourth D in a row?\\
81 - Yeah.\\
82 - It's just on
the penal code stuff.\\
83 - "Criminals have
a right to an attorney."\\
84 - "Criminals are innocent
until proven guilty."\\
85 - Just crazy liberal gibberish.\\
86 - What are you laughing at?\\
87 - He said "penal code."\\
88 - Fez, it doesn't mean that.\\
89 - It's from the word "penalty."
Penal.\\
90 - You're like a four-year-old.\\
91 - It's a legal term. "Penal."\\
92 - It's kind of funny.\\
93 - Hey, guys. Hey, Michael.\\
94 - How'd your penal code test go?\\
95 - I did great. I got another B.\\
96 - Oh, that's your
fourth B in a row.\\
97 - Yeah.\\
98 - I'm so proud of you.
Can I see it?\\
99 - Uh...\\
100 - You could, but I didn't
write anything down\\
101 - because the test was oral.\\
102 - Oral test on the penal code!\\
103 - So, are you free this afternoon?\\
104 - I thought maybe we
could do something.\\
105 - How about go-carting?\\
106 - How about putting
together a crib?\\
107 - Does the crib have wheels?\\
108 - - Yeah.
- Then I'm in.\\
109 - Great. I'll meet you outside.\\
110 - - Bye, guys.
- Bye.\\
111 - Hey, Michael, how come
you told Library Barbie\\
112 - you got Bs instead of Ds?\\
113 - Look, some people bring flowers.\\
114 - Some people buy chocolates.\\
115 - I lie about my intelligence.\\
116 - But it's not working.\\
117 - She's locked up the old
funhouse, if you know what I mean.\\
118 - Michael, no way.
She's totally into you.\\
119 - She changed from clear
lip gloss to pink shimmer.\\
120 - What more does she need to do,
shout "I love you" from the rooftops?\\
121 - Well, she could give me something
besides a kiss on the cheek.\\
122 - It's like kissing your cousin.\\
123 - Oh, the cousin kiss.\\
124 - The sexiest of
all relative kisses.\\
125 - Right above big-breasted aunt\\
126 - and sleepy grandma.\\
127 - Did you just say,
"sleepy grandma"?\\
128 - You telling me you
kiss your grandma?\\
129 - Not my grandma, a grandma.\\
130 - Sick bastard.\\
131 - I've got to say, I'm excited
about marriage counseling.\\
132 - I'm looking forward to hearing from a third
party that I'm right about everything.\\
133 - Oh, and I want my marriage
to Eric to be magical.\\
134 - I know how you could do that.\\
135 - Marry someone besides Eric.\\
136 - Hey, I'll see you guys later.\\
137 - I got someplace I
really need to be.\\
138 - Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.\\
139 - Had someplace I
really needed to be.\\
140 - Okay, so get this.\\
141 - I don't want counseling,
Donna does.\\
142 - So we're going.\\
143 - I'll tell you, ever since we got
engaged, she's been treating me like\\
144 - some kind of child.\\
145 - Oh, where's my toy surprise?\\
146 - Kelso,
watch it with that gun, man.\\
147 - Oh, relax, Eric. It's not
a gun, it's a flare gun.\\
148 - Yeah, tomorrow's Flare Day
at the Academy,\\
149 - so we're learning
how to use these.\\
150 - Besides, they're totally safe.
All they do is shoot balls of fire.\\
151 - Kelso, I don't think you should
be playing with fire when we're all...\\
152 - Never mind.\\
153 - Man, I've got to stop
hitting two circles in one day.\\
154 - I could swear I just saw a ball
of fire shoot through this room.\\
155 - Zowie!\\
156 - Okay, so what brings
you to counseling?\\
157 - A firm tug on the old ball and
chain, if you know what I mean.\\
158 - What Eric is trying to say is\\
159 - we wanted to talk to someone
about the pitfalls of marriage.\\
160 - And we have some little issues.\\
161 - For example, Eric sometimes likes
to talk too much about Star Wars.\\
162 - I understand.\\
163 - You do?\\
164 - See, this is great.\\
165 - Yeah, Star Wars is the
greatest movie of all time.\\
166 - It's hard not to
talk about Star Wars.\\
167 - Wow! This is great!\\
168 - Oh. Oh, no.\\
169 - I can't believe
you've seen Star Wars!\\
170 - Well, I like to stay
current with pop culture\\
171 - so that I can connect
with the youth I counsel.\\
172 - Say, how about that disco?\\
173 - Disco kind of blows.\\
174 - I agree.\\
175 - Blow on, disco. Blow on.\\
176 - Can we get back to
me and Eric, please?\\
177 - Because sometimes I feel like
we're racing toward this wedding,\\
178 - and we're not even enjoying it
as much as we could be.\\
179 - Hmm, I see.\\
180 - Like in Star Wars,\\
181 - when Luke,
much like the two of you,\\
182 - wasn't the pilot
of his own future.\\
183 - But he was a great pilot.\\
184 - - He used to
bull's-eye womp rats...
In his T-16 back home!\\
185 - I should be marrying you.\\
186 - I thought this was a counseling
session, not a dork-off.\\
187 - I'm sorry, Donna.\\
188 - Okay, look, instead of talking about
what worries you about marriage,\\
189 - let's talk about what
excites you about marriage.\\
190 - Oh. Okay, well...\\
191 - Hmm. That's weird. I can't
really think of anything.\\
192 - You can't think of anything?\\
193 - Well, hang on.
Give me a second.\\
194 - Nope. Nothing.\\
195 - Well, one thing young newlyweds
usually get excited about,\\
196 - and that's having sexual
relations for the first time.\\
197 - I'm sure you're both
looking forward to that.\\
198 - - Oh...
- Yeah, that's...\\
199 - Unless, of course,
you've already had sex.\\
200 - Premarital sex.\\
201 - - What?
- Huh?\\
202 - Pre-what-ital-who?\\
203 - I mean, come on, look at me.\\
204 - Do I look like some guy who's
had sex? I mean... Ugh! Right?\\
205 - You're
seeing pictures of what's left\\
206 - of the Point Place Police Academy
auditorium, where a fire broke out today.\\
207 - I hope Kelso's okay.\\
208 - Yeah, I know he was there
'cause today was Flare Day.\\
209 - Today was Flare Day!\\
210 - Hey, what's up?\\
211 - Okay, fine. I was at the Academy
when the auditorium burnt down,\\
212 - but it totally wasn't my fault.\\
213 - See, I got there early
to practice with my flare gun\\
214 - 'cause I wanted to show Brooke
an actual B for a change.\\
215 - Okay, so far, 0% your fault.\\
216 - All right, so I accidentally shot off
a flare, and it went all...\\
217 - Like, right
underneath the bleachers.\\
218 - Well, we've just jumped up to
about 60% your fault.\\
219 - Okay, so then I shot off
another flare at the first flare\\
220 - 'cause you know what they say.
You've got to fight fire with fire.\\
221 - Yeah, this is now,
like, 99% your fault.\\
222 - So then I shot off another flare
to warn people about the fire.\\
223 - But that one just went
right up and on the roof,\\
224 - and that's when I just got
the hell out of there.\\
225 - $5? For Pete's sakes,
God doesn't drive a Cadillac.\\
226 - You know, in these times of loose
morals, even my faith gets challenged,\\
227 - much like Han Solo's faith in his
sometimes unreliable Millennium Falcon.\\
228 - Which is why I'm so pleased to
recently meet a young engaged couple\\
229 - who have turned their backs
on temptation,\\
230 - despite the lure
of premarital sex.\\
231 - Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, no.\\
232 - So here they are, Eric
Forman and Donna Pinciotti.\\
233 - Please stand.\\
234 - Oh, look, it's Eric and Donna.\\
235 - Did everyone know
they're virgins?\\
236 - I think I want to
be a virgin, too.\\
237 - Hey, everyone, I'm a virgin!\\
238 - Well, I said it,
so it must be true.\\
239 - Okay, I know this seems really bad,
but I got a really simple way to fix this.\\
240 - Just start going to
a different church.\\
241 - Hey, how about that one where they sing
more and let you marry, like, six people?\\
242 - Hey, Red, tell me the story
about how Eric and Donna had to\\
243 - stand up in front of the whole
church and pretend to be virgins.\\
244 - Once upon a time,
two dumb asses went to church\\
245 - and brought shame
upon their entire family.\\
246 - And their father had to hear about
it the whole damn car ride home!\\
247 - That is a great story.\\
248 - It's scary, but it's funny, too.\\
249 - What I don't understand is how
you can lie to a pastor in church.\\
250 - Well, Mrs. Forman, what about
the time you lied to Pastor Dan?\\
251 - You told him your dog ate
your bake sale cookies,\\
252 - but you didn't bake them 'cause
you were too busy sipping Kahlua\\
253 - and watching that
Paul Newman retrospective.\\
254 - I did not lie to
Pastor Dan in church.\\
255 - I lied to him at the market,\\
256 - and at the market,
he is just a regular man.\\
257 - Now, you two march back to
church and tell him the truth.\\
258 - And for your information,
Donna, Kahlua is barely a drink.\\
259 - It's like root beer.\\
260 - So I can't believe the Police
Academy caught fire. What happened?\\
261 - Huge mystery.\\
262 - Like, what part of
the cow is the hot dog?\\
263 - Maybe Kelso's just
too traumatized to remember.\\
264 - I think he needs help
filling in the blanks, like...\\
265 - "The fire was
started with a 'blank' gun\\
266 - "by a 'blanking'
idiot named 'blank'-O."\\
267 - Hey, Brooke, could you
wait outside for a minute?\\
268 - Mrs. Forman has this rule
that there's only...\\
269 - One, two, three, four...\\
270 - Five people in
the kitchen at one time.\\
271 - - Well,
there are five people here.
- That's why you need to leave.\\
272 - - But you said no
more than five.
- Right.\\
273 - - But I'm number five.
- Exactly.\\
274 - - So I'll just
wait outside, then?
- Attagirl.\\
275 - Hey, Jackie, I suspect
Kelso hasn't told Brooke\\
276 - that he burned down
the Police Academy.\\
277 - Interesting. I
suspect you're right, Steven.\\
278 - Fez, what do you think?\\
279 - I think I smell cookies.\\
280 - All right,
fine, so I haven't told her.\\
281 - But the only reason she likes me is
'cause I'm doing well at the Academy.\\
282 - Michael, you can't start a
relationship based on a huge lie.\\
283 - You have to start off fresh, and then
gently sprinkle in the lies as you go along.\\
284 - A relationship is like a cookie\\
285 - and the lies are
the tasty chocolate chips.\\
286 - Where are the cookies, damn it?\\
287 - Okay,
what did you want to tell me?\\
288 - Well, you see, Pastor Dan,
when we were here before\\
289 - and you had asked us about
premarital sex,\\
290 - we might have...\\
291 - We lied, okay?\\
292 - We have had sex
zillions of times.\\
293 - I used to try to keep track on a
pad, but it got unwieldy. Oh, God.\\
294 - Eric!\\
295 - Well, I'm sorry, Donna,\\
296 - but we are knocking on
hell's door, and I ain't going in!\\
297 - Eric, you're not going to hell.\\
298 - Well, you might be.
I don't know you that well.\\
299 - I just think you're depriving
yourselves of that wonderful moment\\
300 - when marriage is cemented\\
301 - by giving
the gift of yourselves.\\
302 - Wow. I never
thought about it that way.\\
303 - Maybe that's why you couldn't figure
out the whole excitement about marriage.\\
304 - The one thing you should
have been looking forward to,\\
305 - you had already experienced.\\
306 - Maybe you knew that
without realizing it.\\
307 - Um...\\
308 - I don't mean to bring
up Star Wars again...\\
309 - This is a lot like Luke before
he discovered the Force.\\
310 - Exactly.\\
311 - And what is
the Force in real life?\\
312 - Wow.\\
313 - Brooke, I've got to
tell you something.\\
314 - I burnt down
the Police Academy auditorium.\\
315 - See, this flare
just got away from me.\\
316 - And then there was another flare
that was on purpose, but a bad idea,\\
317 - and a final warning flare that I
now realize was unnecessary\\
318 - 'cause the fire itself
was a pretty big flare.\\
319 - Well, Michael, I'm glad
you were honest with me,\\
320 - because I kind of
have a secret, too.\\
321 - You have a twin sister
that loves threesomes.\\
322 - No, no.\\
323 - I've stopped myself
from getting close to you\\
324 - because I didn't know
if I could trust you.\\
325 - I knew you were lying about the
Police Academy fire because...\\
326 - Well, your friends kind of
gave it away in the kitchen.\\
327 - Also, Fez took me aside today
and just told me,\\
328 - and kind of tried to kiss me.\\
329 - Yeah, he does that.\\
330 - But you were honest with me,
which means I can trust you now.\\
331 - So, is there anything else you'd
like to be honest with me about,\\
332 - like maybe your test grades?\\
333 - Yeah.\\
334 - I didn't get four Bs.\\
335 - I kind of figured.\\
336 - I got four As.
I just didn't want to brag.\\
337 - Well, we committed
seven mortal sins,\\
338 - and all we got was
a half-an-hour lecture.\\
339 - Yeah.\\
340 - But still, I want our
wedding day to be special.\\
341 - You know, something
we'll remember forever.\\
342 - You know what?
Whatever it takes.\\
343 - Which is why I think we shouldn't
have sex again until we're married.\\
344 - What? No. What? No.\\
345 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
346 - You can't cut me off now.
I'm addicted now.\\
347 - Look, Eric, I know it
seems like a crazy idea...\\
348 - Oh, I see your plan, lady. The
first three years are free, huh?\\
349 - Eric, it'll be great.\\
350 - When you think about it,
it's really similar to Star Wars\\
351 - and staying pure,
just like a Jedi.\\
352 - There's no such thing as Jedi.
That's just a stupid movie! God!\\
353 - Last Sunday,
we recognized two congregants\\
354 - for abstaining from sex.\\
355 - Well, it is my sad duty to
report that they were lying!\\
356 - To me, to their families,
to God himself.\\
357 - So let us correct
a great injustice.\\
358 - Please stand, Eric
Forman and Donna Pinciotti.\\
359 - Amen.
\subsection {Episode 15: Who Are You}
1 - Oh, hey, Donna,\\
2 - about this little
celibacy kick we're on,\\
3 - does that cover quickies
because I can be really quick.\\
4 - Well, that's why I
call you The Flash.\\
5 - That's why you
call me The Flash?\\
6 - I thought it was because I
was flashy, like an entertainer.\\
7 - Come on, one little one.
You can even watch TV.\\
8 - Eric, we agreed to hold off
until the wedding. It's cleansing.\\
9 - No, Donna, giving up
cigarettes is cleansing,\\
10 - giving up sex is
reckless and irresponsible\\
11 - and I think it
might cause cancer.\\
12 - Hey, Jackie,
I know since you moved in\\
13 - we agreed to give each other
messages as soon as possible\\
14 - and in the spirit of that,
your mom called last Tuesday.\\
15 - But, what? No, she
couldn't call, she's in Mexico.\\
16 - They don't have phones there.\\
17 - Yeah, they do.\\
18 - Why would we give them phones?\\
19 - My dad tried to get back
in touch with me once.\\
20 - Instead of calling, he just
left a six-pack in my car.\\
21 - - How did you know it was him?
- He was passed
out on the hood.\\
22 - Well, I don't have anything
to say to my mom.\\
23 - She ditched me three months
ago and that's all I need to know.\\
24 - Man, that's really sad. It's like
a mother and daughter divided.\\
25 - So, hey, what about
some second base action?\\
26 - What did I tell you about
talking about the bases, Flash?\\
27 - - Donna?
- He doesn't know why.\\
28 - Jackie, you should cut your mom
a break. I think she's charming.\\
29 - If she calls again, just tell
her I don't wanna see her.\\
30 - Well, that's too bad, 'cause I
just picked her up from the airport.\\
31 - And here I am.\\
32 - - Mom!
- I love making an entrance.\\
33 - - Be a dear and go
watch my luggage.
- Really? Thanks.\\
34 - What are you doing here?\\
35 - Who cares? Welcome to
my driveway, pretty lady.\\
36 - I'm Eric Forman, remember me?
Big fan.\\
37 - Oh, right. My toy poodle, Snowball,
almost killed you when you were six.\\
38 - I was 13, but, yeah.\\
39 - Ms. Burkhart, Steven Hyde,
nice to see you again.\\
40 - Just thought I'd let you know that
Jackie and I are kind of dating now.\\
41 - Didn't you rob our house?\\
42 - Well, I was in there
a few times at night,\\
43 - but I never took anything.\\
44 - Ms. Burkhart!\\
45 - I thought I saw gorgeous
flowing hair on bronze shoulders.\\
46 - And I wasn't near a mirror,
so I knew it had to be you.\\
47 - And I just run where Kelso runs.\\
48 - Mom, why are you back?\\
49 - It got rainy in Cabo,
so I hopped on a plane.\\
50 - I wish I was a plane.\\
51 - Then she could hop on me.\\
52 - - And by hop on me...
- Yeah, yeah. We got it, Fez.\\
53 - Wait,
let me guess, "rainy in Cabo"\\
54 - is Spanish for "my rich pilot
boyfriend ran out of money."\\
55 - Don't be silly.
I don't know any Spanish.\\
56 - Except for
gracias and mas tequila.\\
57 - - I just missed you.
- Well, I didn't miss you.\\
58 - And there's the stomp and cry.\\
59 - See you guys tomorrow.\\
60 - Ms. Burkhart, I know you and Jackie
are working through some difficult stuff,\\
61 - but may I just say, nice tan.\\
62 - Yeah, it really
makes everything pop.\\
63 - Yeah, I'm popping
a little right now.\\
64 - Hanging out\\
65 - Down the street\\
66 - The same old thing\\
67 - We did last week\\
68 - Not a thing to do\\
69 - But talk to you\\
70 - We're all all right\\
71 - We're all all right\\
72 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
73 - Why don't we ever have tea?\\
74 - Well, this sounds like the
beginning of a wonderful argument.\\
75 - Like the stuffing
versus mashed potatoes fight.\\
76 - That turned into, "Why don't
I ever take you on vacation?"\\
77 - - Why don't you ever
take me on vacation?
- Oh, crap.\\
78 - Ugh! Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
I don't know what to do.\\
79 - Oh!\\
80 - Not this again.
Kitty, make it stop.\\
81 - Now, be nice, Red.\\
82 - Her mom finally
came home from her\\
83 - cultural tour of Mexico's
many fine bars and cantinas.\\
84 - Why did she have to go all the
way to Mexico to drink all day?\\
85 - Why couldn't she be a good mom
and just do it at home like you do?\\
86 - Well, that's a good question.\\
87 - And you need to sit down
and talk to her about it.\\
88 - You can do it here, with tea.\\
89 - - We'll have tea.
- No.\\
90 - Why does this
always happen here?\\
91 - We're in a recession, there
are vacant lots all over the place.\\
92 - Well, you can go
stand in a vacant lot.\\
93 - We're having a tea party,
with crumpets.\\
94 - I'll find out what they are
and we will have them.\\
95 - Okay, but I don't know if I
can look my mom in the eye.\\
96 - I mean, I never thought I'd
say this, but there comes a point\\
97 - when a person is too tan.\\
98 - Wow, check out this new police academy
they're sending me to in Waukegan.\\
99 - It's got its own pool.\\
100 - Oh, man, if I had known
it was gonna be this nice,\\
101 - I'd have burned down
the old one a lot sooner.\\
102 - Kelso,
I'm really going to miss you.\\
103 - Who's gonna take my
lunch money and tease me\\
104 - and pull down my
pants in front of girls?\\
105 - I'll be taking over.\\
106 - Hey, you're still gonna
drive me up there, right?\\
107 - Oh, man. Well, Jackie has got
this heavy thing with her mom,\\
108 - I know she's gonna
wanna talk about it a lot.\\
109 - So, yeah, I'll drive you.\\
110 - Hey, since Donna cut me off\\
111 - I took the money that I would have
spent on a romantic dinner for two\\
112 - and bought me
a gross of bottle rockets.\\
113 - Take that, Pinciotti.\\
114 - Bottle rockets, all right.
Fez, start running.\\
115 - No, wait, I got a better idea.\\
116 - After we drop him off, let's
stop off at the dairy farm,\\
117 - scare the hell out of some cows.\\
118 - Ooh, I love cows.\\
119 - They're the one animal
I can run faster than.\\
120 - No, no, let's go
before you drop me off.\\
121 - That big spotty one
needs an attitude adjustment.\\
122 - Hell,
man, it's gotta be at night.\\
123 - Look, I've launched so much
stuff at those cows during the day,\\
124 - I swear they recognize my car.\\
125 - I can't believe you guys
are going without me.\\
126 - Those cows will never know
what hit them.\\
127 - And even after it hits them,\\
128 - they still won't know.\\
129 - Because they're cows.\\
130 - Okay, here. Red. Try this tea.\\
131 - It'll make you feel British.\\
132 - Mum's the word, Governor.\\
133 - Kitty, this is America. We
bomb countries that drink tea.\\
134 - Well, that's because coffee
keeps us awake all night,\\
135 - and we wake up in such a bad
mood, we have to bomb someone.\\
136 - Oh, oh!
I bet that's Jackie's mom.\\
137 - I still don't think we
should get involved in this.\\
138 - As far as I'm concerned,
this is between Jackie\\
139 - and her ditsy lush of a mom.\\
140 - Hi, you must be Red.
I'm Pam Burkhart.\\
141 - It's Pam.\\
142 - You made tea.\\
143 - - Oh, I love tea.
- So do I.\\
144 - Wipe your chin, honey,
you got some drool.\\
145 - Thank you both so
much for doing this.\\
146 - You know, when you are
as beautiful as I am,\\
147 - it's hard to know
who your real friends are.\\
148 - I'm sorry that you
have to go through that.\\
149 - I'm just hoping that Jackie and
I figure out a way to get along.\\
150 - Well, you've got your low-cut,
getting-along sweater on, so...\\
151 - I bet that'll help.\\
152 - Hi, honey.\\
153 - Hi, and by "hi" I mean "not hi,"\\
154 - because I'm not talking to you,
even though I'm talking now.\\
155 - So I'm just gonna stop
talking, starting now.\\
156 - Dang it, starting now.\\
157 - And now.\\
158 - This is awkward.\\
159 - Why don't I tell a story about
something charming I did in Mexico.\\
160 - I'd love to hear it.\\
161 - Okay, well, there was this
woman on a beach in Cozumel,\\
162 - and normally I wouldn't talk to
someone who had such bad skin.\\
163 - But she was selling the
cutest hair clips, so, here.\\
164 - You know, I'd tell you
this doesn't fix anything,\\
165 - but I'm not talking to you.
Oh, shoot!\\
166 - Starting now.\\
167 - Yeah, nice try, Mrs. Burkhart.\\
168 - Damn, these are cute.\\
169 - Look, Jackie, when your father
got into trouble, I panicked.\\
170 - But that doesn't mean
I stopped caring about you.\\
171 - Jackie, if you seriously don't
want these, can I have them?\\
172 - Mom, a good time
to tell me you cared about me\\
173 - was the day
Daddy went to prison.\\
174 - Not two months later in a postcard from
La Cantina Cucaracha in Guadalajara.\\
175 - Isn't it nice to get postcards?\\
176 - Okay, fine.\\
177 - Jackie, look. I know that you've
got hostile feelings towards me,\\
178 - but I'm your
mother and I love you.\\
179 - And I promise I'll
never leave you again.\\
180 - - I believe her.
- Me, too.\\
181 - Kelso.\\
182 - You leave for the police
academy tomorrow,\\
183 - shouldn't you be packing
gasoline and matches\\
184 - so you can burn
that one down, too?\\
185 - No, I don't need gasoline
to burn stuff down.\\
186 - All I need is these two hands
and a lack of adult supervision.\\
187 - Anyway, I'm not going. I
decided I didn't wanna be a cop.\\
188 - But, Kelso, I thought you wanted
to impress the mother of your child\\
189 - and give your
life a purpose and...\\
190 - Pull over girls for
speeding while foxy.\\
191 - No, I got my reasons.\\
192 - I mean, I don't wanna leave when things
are going so good for me and Brooke.\\
193 - Plus, blue isn't
a very good color for me.\\
194 - What, are you crazy? You
take blue to a whole new level.\\
195 - All right,
let's go blast some cows.\\
196 - Whoa, all you talk about is being a cop,
you haven't focused on anything this hard\\
197 - since you thought you heard
your name on Led Zeppelin II.\\
198 - It's in there.\\
199 - In Whole Lotta Love he
clearly sings, "Kelso lotta love."\\
200 - Kelso, I'm gonna make sure
you become a cop.\\
201 - Yeah. We're not gonna let
you throw your life away.\\
202 - I don't care about that.\\
203 - Look, I got a few things
pending downtown\\
204 - and I need
someone on the inside.\\
205 - Jackie, just go see your mom.\\
206 - She chose you over golden
sunsets, frozen margaritas...\\
207 - Man, why aren't we down there?\\
208 - Donna, you don't get her.\\
209 - Because you'll never understand\\
210 - the intoxicating quality of getting
anything you want with your looks.\\
211 - Look, she's just here till
she finds a new meal ticket.\\
212 - I don't believe
that for a minute.\\
213 - I think she came back to be with
you, not to find some lonely rich guy.\\
214 - Your mother is a lovely woman.\\
215 - Donna, Pam and I are gonna
catch a movie.\\
216 - It's my first
American date in months.\\
217 - Your mother is
a gold-digging tramp.\\
218 - I can't believe my mom is
going out with your Bob of a dad.\\
219 - What, he's not good enough?\\
220 - Ah! So you see it, too.\\
221 - Look, I expect her to go after
a cool rich guy like\\
222 - Jack Nicholson or a Bee Gee.\\
223 - Your dad is cheesy
and corny like nachos.\\
224 - Well, then no wonder
your mom is after him.\\
225 - - She'll touch
anything from Mexico.
- Oh, hey!\\
226 - You take that back right now
or I will pull your hair really hard.\\
227 - Oh, yeah.\\
228 - Eric, not now.\\
229 - Look, I'm sorry, Donna, but you cut
me off and I always thought it was lame\\
230 - when Kelso said that
girl fights were sexy\\
231 - but now I can see
that he was very right.\\
232 - So you, hair pull.
You, shirt rip.\\
233 - You better go talk to your mom.\\
234 - You better go talk to your dad.\\
235 - Hmm.\\
236 - I overplayed my hand
there a little bit.\\
237 - Hey, come on, buddy.
Time to go to cop school.\\
238 - - I don't believe this.
- I know.\\
239 - King-size pillows in a twin-size
bed, why didn't I think of that?\\
240 - Man, he just split on us.\\
241 - Yeah, he's definitely gone.
I guess we just leave then.\\
242 - That's not fair.
You guys made leaving sounds.\\
243 - Come on, Kitty, enough
with the silent treatment.\\
244 - I didn't say that I like tea
because Pam is pretty.\\
245 - I said that I like tea
because you were kind enough\\
246 - and courageous
enough to open my eyes\\
247 - to a whole new
world of hot beverages.\\
248 - Which is just one of the millions
of things that you have done\\
249 - to improve my life
over all these years.\\
250 - So now I'm old.\\
251 - Mr. Forman, will you please
talk some sense into my dad?\\
252 - Last night he went on a date
with Jackie's mom.\\
253 - Oh, you hear that, Red? Looks
like your girlfriend is stepping out.\\
254 - Donna, Pam is just what
I've been looking for.\\
255 - I've loved pretty women
and I've loved smart women.\\
256 - And I'm going back to pretty.\\
257 - Dad, don't you think
it's a little suspicious\\
258 - that she just got back and
she's already latched on to you?\\
259 - I'm a very cute man, Donna.\\
260 - Bob, this is clearly upsetting
Donna. How can you date her?\\
261 - Yeah, how can you date her?\\
262 - - What does that mean?
- What?\\
263 - You emphasized "her" like there's
something special about "her."\\
264 - I just said what you said.\\
265 - But you must have missed it,\\
266 - because I was on my way
outside to mow the lawn.\\
267 - Oh, man, I can't believe Donna
is serious about this celibacy thing.\\
268 - Fez, how do you cope
with not getting any?\\
269 - I think you know how I cope.\\
270 - When you don't
see me, I'm coping.\\
271 - Hey, he tried to get away again
so I had to use his stun gun on him.\\
272 - Yeah, it didn't hurt, though.\\
273 - Done it to myself so many
times, I barely feel it anymore.\\
274 - Okay, just get in the car.\\
275 - You know, you guys
can take me to the academy\\
276 - but as soon as
you leave, I'm gone.\\
277 - All right, Kelso, that's it.
I haven't had sex in weeks,\\
278 - Fez is in a drought not seen
since the Great Dust Bowl.\\
279 - We are tightly wound.\\
280 - So, you better tell us
what your real problem is\\
281 - or we're gonna
freaking throttle you.\\
282 - I will tear you
apart like a lion.\\
283 - Okay, look,
I don't wanna tell you guys\\
284 - because I'm afraid
you're gonna make fun of me.\\
285 - Kelso, of course we're gonna
make fun of you.\\
286 - All right, fine. You know what, it's
like I'm going to a new school, okay?\\
287 - And I'm worried that I'm not
gonna be able to make friends.\\
288 - First off, I'm so much better
looking than everyone else.\\
289 - The only reason you guys
are friends with me\\
290 - is because you met me
before I blossomed.\\
291 - Man, you should be worried about
something that could actually happen,\\
292 - like handcuffing
yourself to a horse.\\
293 - Look, Kelso, here's the thing,\\
294 - you've stolen my stuff
and you've burned my stuff.\\
295 - You've even groped my stuff.\\
296 - But I still hang out with you
because you are a great guy.\\
297 - Come on,
you're Michael Kelso, right?\\
298 - You're bullet-proof.\\
299 - Yeah, man, you're right.
I am bullet-proof.\\
300 - - All right, let's get going.
- All right.\\
301 - Hey, by the way, you're
not actually bullet-proof.\\
302 - - Where do you
think you're going?
- To the backyard.\\
303 - No, I'm going to the backyard.\\
304 - Whatever.\\
305 - Don't give me that dirty look and
say, "Whatever." That is my thing.\\
306 - - Oh, my God.
- Hot tub.\\
307 - Mom, what are you doing in
there with that wet, hairy man?\\
308 - And why are you wearing
a white swimsuit? It's winter.\\
309 - Bobby and I are
just having a soak.\\
310 - Bobby?\\
311 - When did we get
a hot tub, Bobby?\\
312 - Me and Pammy were out shopping
and I saw it so I bought it.\\
313 - Even got the good one
with the euphoria jet.\\
314 - I love it in here.\\
315 - If you put salt around the rim it
would be like being in a giant margarita.\\
316 - Hey, what the hell, right?
Yeah.\\
317 - I have all this extra money and
Pammy here helped me spend some.\\
318 - Yeah, that's her specialty.\\
319 - You shut up about my mom.\\
320 - - Thank you, Jackie.
- I wasn't defending you, okay?\\
321 - This is just really weird.\\
322 - Can you both at least put your
hands up where I can see them?\\
323 - Enough, all right?\\
324 - I like Pam and she likes me.
We're both adults.\\
325 - So if you two can't handle it,
that's too bad.\\
326 - Now go inside.
You're ruining our soak.\\
327 - This soak is over.\\
328 - Then we'll go inside.\\
329 - Dad, are you naked?\\
330 - How else am I gonna
try the euphoria jet?\\
331 - Okay, I know we both have
different reasons\\
332 - for wanting our parents
to stop seeing each other.\\
333 - Like, I hate your mom
and your mom's a tramp.\\
334 - But we have to join forces and do
everything we can to break them up.\\
335 - Now, I'm with you, Donna.\\
336 - All the couples I've broken up
before were just training till now.\\
337 - This one's not for popularity
or to make another girl cry,\\
338 - it's for my beautiful mom and
your mayonnaise-loving dad.\\
339 - - How's it going, girls?
- Not good.\\
340 - We just saw Bob
and Pam in a hot tub.\\
341 - - Bob and Pam are in a hot tub?
- Pam's in a hot tub?\\
342 - There, you did it again and this
time you didn't even say, "Bob."\\
343 - - Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.\\
344 - Yes, I did.\\
345 - And you would have heard it, too,
if it hadn't been for all that damn tea.\\
346 - You know, I fought a war to
keep that crap out of this country\\
347 - and you had to
bring it into my house\\
348 - and you call
yourself an American. Ha!\\
349 - Okay, I'm all set, so...\\
350 - - Here I go.
- Kelso, you're gonna do great.\\
351 - But, hey, just in case,\\
352 - I packed some extra cookies in
your lunch to help you make friends.\\
353 - Oh, I ate the cookies.\\
354 - Try to find
a friend who likes carrots.\\
355 - Okay, well...\\
356 - Guess this is it.\\
357 - Hey, give those cows hell, boys.\\
358 - Hey, Kelso...\\
359 - I love you!\\
360 - - Shut up.
- I love you, too, Kelso!\\
361 - - Just quit it.
- I love you the most!\\
362 - We were just kidding.\\
363 - So was I, so was I.\\
364 - I can't believe
there were no cows, man.\\
365 - Yeah, what are we gonna do
with all these bottle rockets?\\
366 - Fine, I'll be the cow.\\
367 - But this time,
count all the way to ten.\\
368 - You got it buddy.\\
369 - - One...
- Ten!
\subsection {Episode 16: Man with Money}
1 - When the shark bites
with his teeth, dear\\
2 - Ah, you're awfully happy.\\
3 - We're having a cocktail party.
What's not to be happy about?\\
4 - Red, the last time
we had a party,\\
5 - you called the cops and
had them tow everyone's car.\\
6 - Drunk people looking for
their cars, that was funny.\\
7 - Oh, you're just giddy because\\
8 - Bob's bringing his pretty
new girlfriend over.\\
9 - Oh, Kitty, don't be ridiculous.\\
10 - I'm just happy. Now why do
you want to ruin my happiness?\\
11 - Because that's what a wife does.\\
12 - You know, my dad dating your mom
goes against all the laws of nature.\\
13 - I mean, you don't see
a giraffe with a panda bear.\\
14 - You know, my dad being
the cute, fuzzy panda bear,\\
15 - and your mom being the evil,
money-hungry, unnaturally tanned giraffe.\\
16 - Well, I've had it
with them, too.\\
17 - Last night, your dad
burped in front of my mom.\\
18 - And she laughed, Donna, laughed.\\
19 - We are Burkharts.\\
20 - We don't burp, and we
don't tolerate people who do.\\
21 - Hey, everybody.
I brought a date.\\
22 - Look how tall she is.\\
23 - It's like I'm dating
the Statue of Liberty.\\
24 - Oh, Kitty, I just love
coming over to your house.\\
25 - You have such unique tastes.\\
26 - It's like being in
a giant flea market.\\
27 - And like at every flea market,\\
28 - Bob's gonna leave
with the tackiest thing here.\\
29 - Pam, come on in.
I made your favorite drink.\\
30 - Tequila Sunrise.\\
31 - - Red, always the gentleman.
- Yeah, well.\\
32 - Red, Red... Honey,
where's my favorite drink?\\
33 - I didn't know you had
a favorite drink, Kitty,\\
34 - seeing as how much
you like all drinks.\\
35 - - I'll take a drink, Red.
- Beer is in the garage, Bob.\\
36 - Mrs. Burkhart!\\
37 - That's weird.\\
38 - Golly, I didn't know
you were dropping by.\\
39 - Yeah, you did.\\
40 - I told you she was and you said,
"Oh, boy, I'm gonna wear my suit."\\
41 - Well, I'm sorry, Donna, is there some
kind of law against being handsome?\\
42 - Because if there is, then...\\
43 - Guilty as charged.\\
44 - Mrs. Burkhart,
when did you get here?\\
45 - Is it too much for you people to let
me know that we have company?\\
46 - One bronzed-up tart in the room\\
47 - and all the men turn into a
bunch of oversexed fraternity boys.\\
48 - Kitty, you're just
imagining things.\\
49 - What's she wearing?\\
50 - Hanging out\\
51 - Down the street\\
52 - The same old thing\\
53 - We did last week\\
54 - Not a thing to do\\
55 - But talk to you\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - We're all all right\\
58 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
59 - Oh, I cannot believe you kids
trying to sneak off with my good gin.\\
60 - Yeah, I should have known.\\
61 - She can smell booze
from a mile away.\\
62 - Excuse me?\\
63 - Oh, I said, you smell like
booze from a mile away.\\
64 - That's worse, dumb ass.\\
65 - Oh, what a lovely evening.\\
66 - If I didn't know any better, I'd
swear I was with rich people.\\
67 - Oh, she's got it all,
looks and beauty.\\
68 - Pam, you want another drink?\\
69 - No, honey,
you shouldn't be drinking.\\
70 - You have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow.\\
71 - He has a heart condition.
He's very old.\\
72 - I never thought I'd say this,
but I wish I was Bob.\\
73 - I wonder if she'd like to watch
The Graduate with me some night.\\
74 - You know, one time,
back when I was dating Jackie,\\
75 - Pam was trying to
wash her car, right,\\
76 - and she leaned over and like
squeezed out the sponge.\\
77 - That's all I remember,
'cause I rode my bike\\
78 - straight into a tree.\\
79 - Oh, look at her.\\
80 - Would you ever want me
to show that much leg?\\
81 - Absolutely not.\\
82 - And why not?\\
83 - You set me up.\\
84 - Jackie, I can't see
your mom's hand,\\
85 - which means
it's on my dad's butt.\\
86 - We have to break them up.\\
87 - I've been badmouthing
Pinciottis for years. I can't be one.\\
88 - So that's when I realized that
tapas sounds a lot like topless.\\
89 - But I already promised, so...\\
90 - Hey, Mrs. Burkhart.\\
91 - Why don't I throw on some music
for us to shake our booties to?\\
92 - Hey, stop acting like an ass
in front of the pretty lady.\\
93 - That's okay, Red.
I think he's cute.\\
94 - Yeah, well.
He is my son, you know?\\
95 - Well, good party.\\
96 - Good party.
When Pam and I were dancing,\\
97 - she accidentally
brushed my butt.\\
98 - And tell them what
happened after that.\\
99 - Well, then I said, "Hey, you
can squeeze my butt anytime."\\
100 - And then it got really quiet.\\
101 - And then she walked over to Bob,\\
102 - and they were
talking and pointing at me.\\
103 - Then you tried to laugh it off
and you spit dip up on your shirt.\\
104 - Then you tried to do that joke\\
105 - where you scoop the dip off your
shirt with the chip, and no one laughed.\\
106 - And here we are.\\
107 - You know, there's
a lot of talk about Pam.\\
108 - But, Eric, I still have
feelings for your mom.\\
109 - She comes off all pure,
but she's dirty.\\
110 - Why can't my dad just see
that Pam is a total gold digger?\\
111 - Oh, would you stop saying that?\\
112 - Hey, either she digs for gold
or she doesn't.\\
113 - It's easy to check.\\
114 - Are her boots muddy?\\
115 - Does she carry a pickaxe?\\
116 - When she comes home does she
say, "Tough day at the gold mine"?\\
117 - No, Fez, a gold digger is
what these idiots call a woman\\
118 - who knows that love eventually
wears off, but money is forever.\\
119 - You guys, all I know is,
pretty-tanned lady touched my butt.\\
120 - And that is more action
than I've gotten in weeks.\\
121 - Keep it up, you'll be
having sex with yourself.\\
122 - I mean, how does Bob pull all
these foxes like Midge and Pam?\\
123 - He's got to have something
the ladies can't resist.\\
124 - Hey, Donna,
you ever see your dad naked?\\
125 - Oh, my God! Can we please
talk about anything besides that?\\
126 - You're way off, Hyde. Women
love Bob for his sense of humor.\\
127 - That sucker is
funnier than a Dixie cup.\\
128 - No. All right, how it works is
relationships are based on a point system.\\
129 - All right, see,
Pam is good-looking.\\
130 - So that's 20 points.\\
131 - And Bob, he's like
the nicest guy in the world.\\
132 - So that's like, what?
Like a point.\\
133 - But Bob's got money,
and that's 19 points.\\
134 - And altogether that's 20.\\
135 - Now, you add the whole
thing together, and that's 40,\\
136 - which is incidentally
almost half my score.\\
137 - I don't care what
that doctor says.\\
138 - I'm not wearing this
stupid heart monitor.\\
139 - Makes me look like a damn robot.\\
140 - Red, I'm sure you won't
even know it's there.\\
141 - It'll only beep if your heart
rate goes above normal,\\
142 - like when you get agitated, or
excited, or extra angry, or extra happy.\\
143 - Putting my money on extra angry.\\
144 - I bet the damn
thing doesn't even work.\\
145 - You know what, Red?
Your attitude stinks.\\
146 - You wouldn't be in this mess if you
just listened to me in the first place.\\
147 - - Kitty...
- I told you to eat\\
148 - more fiber in the mornings.
I told you to exercise.\\
149 - I even told you to wear more
comfortable shoes for circulation.\\
150 - Did you listen? No.\\
151 - So, I guess I'm just gonna keep telling
you and telling you and telling you...\\
152 - What do you know?
It does work.\\
153 - Man, I can't believe you
guys aren't in Bob's hot tub.\\
154 - You know, I feel like Warren
Beatty in a movie about a hot tub.\\
155 - He's like hot tubbing,
then like...\\
156 - ...other stuff happens.\\
157 - Kelso, just so you know,
Bob was in there an hour ago.\\
158 - So you are like\\
159 - covered in hot bubbly Bob.\\
160 - Dad, will you please
listen to us?\\
161 - We talked about it and we really
think you need to break up with Pam.\\
162 - - No way.
- Open your eyes.\\
163 - Everyone can see
what a big mistake this is.\\
164 - Oh, so everyone here thinks I
should just break up with Pam?\\
165 - I say stick with her, Bob.\\
166 - My only advice is take pictures,\\
167 - otherwise no one's
gonna believe you.\\
168 - Don't listen to him. He
grew up poor. He's stupid.\\
169 - What do you think, Eric?\\
170 - Yeah, Eric.\\
171 - What do you think?\\
172 - I hope it's the right answer.\\
173 - You love that woman
for all she's worth, Bob.\\
174 - Eric!\\
175 - What... What are you gonna do?
Cut me off from sex again?\\
176 - I agree with Forman, Bob.
I think you should keep her.\\
177 - I mean, you're you and
you're getting me quality girls.\\
178 - You're living life
Kelso style. Enjoy.\\
179 - Oh. I'm so sorry I'm late.\\
180 - I locked my keys in the car and I had
to use the coat hanger to jimmy the lock.\\
181 - I had to reach down in there and I
had to shimmy and shimmy and shimmy\\
182 - until the darn thing
finally popped open.\\
183 - Boy, I'm sorry I missed that.\\
184 - Yeah, could you act it out
for us one more time?\\
185 - Look, Mom,\\
186 - Donna and I decided that you
two can't see each other anymore.\\
187 - We're your children
and we love you,\\
188 - but your happiness is much
less important than ours.\\
189 - Jackie, when your
dad went away to jail,\\
190 - I decided to do
some work on myself.\\
191 - Not on the outside, obviously,
because, well, come on,\\
192 - but on the inside, you know, the
part that doesn't matter as much.\\
193 - And I realized that\\
194 - I need a man who makes me
feel good about myself.\\
195 - I need you, Bob.\\
196 - Oh.\\
197 - You know, if an ugly woman said
that, it just wouldn't mean as much.\\
198 - Man,
if this was a movie,\\
199 - Pam would pick up Bob and
just carry him off to a better life.\\
200 - If this were a good movie, Pam
would have ended the scene topless.\\
201 - Yeah, if this were
a great movie,\\
202 - they'd have a monkey friend
that did all this crazy stuff.\\
203 - You know what? You guys were no
help. You could have backed us up.\\
204 - And you could be
sleeping with me.\\
205 - People could be doing
a lot of things.\\
206 - All right, I'm done peeing.\\
207 - Hey, could you
hand me my clothes?\\
208 - Kelso, are you naked?\\
209 - No.\\
210 - Eric, could you hand me
my clothes, please?\\
211 - I'm sorry, buddy, I can't
hear you over the hot tub.\\
212 - - Did you hear him, Hyde?
- I think so.\\
213 - I think he said to take
his clothes and run away.\\
214 - Oh.\\
215 - Guys, guys, come back!\\
216 - Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to be nude in front of you guys,\\
217 - and that's kind of awkward,\\
218 - so I think you ladies
should nude up.\\
219 - Hey.\\
220 - Good news, Red.\\
221 - I made your favorite lunch.\\
222 - Lasagna.\\
223 - Thanks.\\
224 - Thanks?\\
225 - Aren't you excited?\\
226 - Let's hear that monitor.\\
227 - So, every time you do
something nice for me,\\
228 - I'm supposed to
have a heart attack?\\
229 - Well, no.\\
230 - Not an attack,
just a little episode.\\
231 - I mean, what does it take
to get that beeper going?\\
232 - Hi, Red.\\
233 - Wow!\\
234 - That must be
the lasagna kicking in.\\
235 - Hey.\\
236 - What do you say we have
some more of that lasagna?\\
237 - Boy, was that delicious.\\
238 - Oh, can it, Red.
When Pam showed up,\\
239 - your heart monitor went off
like a freaking slot machine.\\
240 - Pam had nothing to do with
that thing going off, damn it!\\
241 - Oh, and look at us now,
we're arguing.\\
242 - Can't even get
a beep out of you.\\
243 - Your son is a jerk.\\
244 - Come on, I'm gonna prove to
you that I'm not attracted to Pam.\\
245 - Hey, guys.\\
246 - I think I'm having
a war flashback.\\
247 - I'm messed up, Kitty.\\
248 - I'm real messed up.\\
249 - I cannot believe you told
my dad to stay with Pam.\\
250 - She doesn't even like you.\\
251 - She told my dad
you groped her at the party.\\
252 - Okay, look, Donna. You and Pam
obviously have some serious issues.\\
253 - I think you two
should work them out\\
254 - with a good
old-fashioned pillow fight.\\
255 - Come on, Jackie, I think maybe
you should throw on a nightgown\\
256 - and defend your mom.\\
257 - You're sick!\\
258 - And you,
you were no help, either.\\
259 - Hey, I was just agreeing with
Forman so he didn't look so bad.\\
260 - You said it before he did.\\
261 - Oh, yeah.\\
262 - What's the big deal?\\
263 - Bob and Pam are
those who want to do\\
264 - what comes naturally
to everybody except me.\\
265 - So, I say,
why can't they get any?\\
266 - You know, Pam wants
to be with my dad now,\\
267 - but what happens
when someone else comes along?\\
268 - I wouldn't care so much
if I could just, you know,\\
269 - test her with a hotter guy
and see if she falls for him.\\
270 - Because I love you...\\
271 - I'll do it.\\
272 - Why would you do it?
This is a man's job.\\
273 - Don't wait up for me, baby.\\
274 - No, it has to be
someone her type.\\
275 - Well, I know from
our time in Mexico\\
276 - that she has a weakness
for young, dark-skinned guys.\\
277 - I guess I can ask around.\\
278 - Mmm. That smells delicious.\\
279 - - What is it?
- It's not for you.\\
280 - You can go look for scraps
around the neighborhood\\
281 - like the rest of the dogs.\\
282 - Kitty, for the last time,
I'm not attracted to Pam.\\
283 - Please,
believe me, as the husband\\
284 - who has shared your laughter
and tears for...\\
285 - ...many happy years.\\
286 - How many years, Red?\\
287 - All of them.\\
288 - You can't give me a number,
can you?\\
289 - Well, I can tell you
on a scale of one to 10,\\
290 - I love you 10.\\
291 - That's a number.\\
292 - Oh, why don't you just take your
cardiac jukebox over to Pam's?\\
293 - Hi, Kitty. Hi, Red.\\
294 - I thought we'd come over and see
if you two wanted to catch a movie.\\
295 - Why are you staring?\\
296 - Too pretty for Wisconsin?\\
297 - I get that a lot.\\
298 - You shut it off, didn't you?\\
299 - - No, I did not shut it off.
- Let's hustle it up.\\
300 - I don't want to sit behind
people with hats.\\
301 - Ha!\\
302 - Look at that, nosy.\\
303 - It's not Pam, it's Bob,
because he annoys me.\\
304 - That's true. I do.\\
305 - What are you guys talking about?\\
306 - Um...\\
307 - I, um...\\
308 - I, I, I sort of thought that...\\
309 - That Red had a crush on you.\\
310 - Oh, Kitty. I'm sorry.\\
311 - This face can bring as
much trouble as it does joy.\\
312 - Well, Kitty, what do you
have to say for yourself?\\
313 - It's the menopause.\\
314 - I'm messed up, Red.
I'm real messed up.\\
315 - Um... Hello.\\
316 - What are you doing?\\
317 - I was hired to
clean the hot tub.\\
318 - But you should know that I...\\
319 - ...perform other
services, too.\\
320 - Well, you could start
by doing a better job.\\
321 - It's still dirty.\\
322 - Oh!\\
323 - So, you like it dirty?\\
324 - - No, I want it clean.
- So, you like it filthy?\\
325 - - Bob!
- Whoa, I'm not into that.\\
326 - No.\\
327 - Hey, Eric, that was a good
burn stealing my clothes.\\
328 - The laugh's on you,
'cause I borrowed your pants\\
329 - and I'm not
wearing any underwear.\\
330 - Kelso, just so you know, the
last time I wore those pants\\
331 - I wasn't wearing any underwear.\\
332 - Ouch, well played.\\
333 - Where the hell is Fez? He
should have been back by now.\\
334 - I swear, if he touched
my mother inappropriately,\\
335 - he is never borrowing
my curling iron again.\\
336 - Man, first I wanted to be Bob.
Now I wish I was Fez.\\
337 - What the hell is
going on this week?\\
338 - Did you tell Fez to
make a move on Pam?\\
339 - 'Cause if you didn't,
I'm gonna box him up\\
340 - and send him
back to banana town.\\
341 - Okay, I'm sick
of those comments.\\
342 - I don't say I'm gonna send
you back to polyester town.\\
343 - Dad, I'm really sorry.\\
344 - It was just the only thing we could
think of to prove that Pam doesn't,\\
345 - - you know,
really care about you.
- Well, guess what?\\
346 - She does really care about me.\\
347 - So, you can stop playing
these little games,\\
348 - because Pam makes me happier
than I have been in a long time.\\
349 - And you better accept it soon,
'cause she's here to stay.\\
350 - That's right,
I will have my pretty lady.\\
351 - This Bob is back.\\
352 - - Way to go, Bob.
- Yeah, Bob.\\
353 - I love you, man!\\
354 - Bob, you're just like me.\\
355 - We give regular guys hope.\\
356 - You can't leave Pam because...\\
357 - Because Pam is your Donna.\\
358 - Steven, am I your Donna?\\
359 - That doesn't apply to us.
We're both good-looking.\\
360 - Dad, can we at
least talk about this?\\
361 - I'm sorry, Donna.
That's the way it's gonna be.\\
362 - I don't want to
talk about it anymore.\\
363 - Should've known
this wasn't gonna work.\\
364 - Foreigners never finish a job.\\
365 - Oh, please.
If Bob hadn't shown up,\\
366 - I'd be your
step daddy right now.\\
367 - B-7.\\
368 - Miss.\\
369 - Oh, man,
how do I keep missing you?\\
370 - It's 'cause I don't
have any boats on there.\\
371 - - What's that noise?
- It's my dad's heart monitor.\\
372 - - Where's your mom?
- She's with him.\\
373 - Oh, man, take off the beeper!
Other people live here!
\subsection {Episode 17: Happy Jack}
1 - So, that is all for
the pictures of my mom\\
2 - in Cancun when she abandoned me.\\
3 - Now let's move on to my mom in
Acapulco, when she abandoned me.\\
4 - God, I cannot believe how
good your mom looks in a bikini.\\
5 - I mean, she's approaching,
like, "me" territory.\\
6 - Isn't the bikini
a marvelous invention?\\
7 - Imagine the first Aztec
who said,\\
8 - "I just gotta see some more
belly button," you know?\\
9 - Yeah, the Mexicans are
such a resourceful people.\\
10 - Eric, don't be so stupid.\\
11 - Everyone knows the
French invented the bikini.\\
12 - The Mexicans just added on
the top 'cause they're Catholic.\\
13 - Another good example of
religion dividing instead of uniting.\\
14 - Does anyone want a soda?\\
15 - - Yeah.
- Please.\\
16 - And FYI, if God wanted
Mexican women to wear tops,\\
17 - he wouldn't have
created tequila.\\
18 - Where the hell is
Eric with our sodas?\\
19 - Eric!\\
20 - Maybe he ran home.
He's kind of a mama's boy.\\
21 - Eric? Oh, my God!\\
22 - I'm busy!\\
23 - Oh, my God!\\
24 - Ew. Was he going
to the bathroom?\\
25 - No!\\
26 - Hanging out\\
27 - Down the street\\
28 - The same old thing\\
29 - We did last week\\
30 - Not a thing to do\\
31 - But talk to you\\
32 - We're all all right\\
33 - We're all all right\\
34 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
35 - Okay, okay.\\
36 - Okay, something happened.\\
37 - And I think it's safe to say that it
was certainly in the area of horrific.\\
38 - Like war,\\
39 - or when my mom sings
Do You Think I'm Sexy?\\
40 - While she vacuums.\\
41 - What happened?\\
42 - Well, we all know that as a
young man in the prime of his life,\\
43 - I have some needs.\\
44 - Amen, brother.\\
45 - Wait a minute. This is
the prime of your life?\\
46 - You live at home with your mommy\\
47 - and you have to wear
a nametag at work.\\
48 - Anyway...\\
49 - Today, at the house
of the woman that I was\\
50 - theoretically going to marry,\\
51 - I had some needs
that I felt it necessary\\
52 - to take care of
right then and there.\\
53 - In her house?\\
54 - Why don't you just do
it at the bus station\\
55 - like the other degenerates?\\
56 - It's... I... You know,
I don't know.\\
57 - There I was,
there the bathroom was.\\
58 - It was like two trains
passing in the night.\\
59 - That's beautiful.\\
60 - You know, it kind of was.\\
61 - And then Donna walked in.\\
62 - - Oh, my God!
- She didn't!\\
63 - I can't believe we're going to visit Kelso
at the Police Academy this weekend.\\
64 - We're going to miss
the best part,\\
65 - when he makes
the whole thing worse.\\
66 - How could I make this worse?\\
67 - I don't know.\\
68 - Man, it seems impossible,
but you always find a way.\\
69 - You're like The Little Engine
Who Could of screwing yourself.\\
70 - You know what?\\
71 - This is Donna's fault
with her, you know,\\
72 - "No more sex
till we're married" crap.\\
73 - You guys have no idea how
hard it's been to have no sex at all.\\
74 - Yeah, it must be horrible.\\
75 - Seriously,
you guys, what do I do now?\\
76 - I say you've got
to pull a Nixon.\\
77 - Deny, deny, deny.\\
78 - No, you just need a good story.\\
79 - Whenever I get caught, I just tell
people that I'm checking for ticks.\\
80 - Fez, how many times
have you been caught?\\
81 - Oh, come on, I'm not stopping
just because a doorknob turns.\\
82 - Ooh, man, look at these jokers.\\
83 - I can't believe this is who
Kelso hangs out with now.\\
84 - If he doesn't dunk one of
these heads in a toilet bowl,\\
85 - I'm buying him a skirt.\\
86 - Fellows.\\
87 - It's good to see you boys.\\
88 - - What the hell is that?
- Oh, the 'stache.\\
89 - Yeah, it's coming in nice, huh?\\
90 - That's why they call the fuzz,
"the fuzz". They're covered in fuzz.\\
91 - Like someone threw paint
on the Mona Lisa.\\
92 - Oh, please, Michael
Kelso's a masterpiece.\\
93 - You know it, I know it.\\
94 - Yeah, about that.\\
95 - I'm going by "Mike" now.
It's my cop name.\\
96 - But we call you Kelso.\\
97 - Yeah, well, I'm going to have
to ask you to call me Mike!\\
98 - As far as
the 'stache goes, I like it.\\
99 - Makes me look like
an authority figure.\\
100 - Makes you look like a porn star.\\
101 - Either way.\\
102 - Cadet Mike.\\
103 - Officer Kennedy, you know
my friends, Hyde and Fez.\\
104 - Yeah, I remember.\\
105 - But it seems to me their
names were Trouble and Maker.\\
106 - Trouble and Maker.
That's clever.\\
107 - I think it's funny. They put us
together and we're troublemakers.\\
108 - Shut up.\\
109 - I hope these two delinquents
don't interfere\\
110 - with the progress
you've been making here, Mike.\\
111 - No, sir. Not at all, sir.\\
112 - Well, we'll see.\\
113 - I'll have my eye on you.
On all of you.\\
114 - He's a good man.\\
115 - All right, you're really
starting to creep me out.\\
116 - Help me grab
the beer out of the car.\\
117 - I'm going to drink until that mustache
turns into a caterpillar and crawls away.\\
118 - Sorry, no can do.\\
119 - I got KP in the a.m.
and PT in the p.m.\\
120 - Well, I don't know
what any of that means,\\
121 - but I came here to drink beer
and play with guns, damn it.\\
122 - Sorry, buddy, but we got
lights out at 22 hundskies,\\
123 - so I'm going to have to ask you to
move along to the barracks ASAP.\\
124 - Did you just call me a sap?\\
125 - No, ASAP. As soon as possible.\\
126 - Well, you're a sap right now!\\
127 - Okay, the thing is,
I knew Eric did that,\\
128 - but knowing and seeing
are two very different things.\\
129 - It's kind of like how I know
there are rats under the house.\\
130 - But you don't want to see the rats
diddling themselves in your bathroom.\\
131 - Exactly!\\
132 - But, Donna, you're
missing the whole point here.\\
133 - Eric's perverted behavior can be a card
you could play for the rest of your life.\\
134 - Let's just say you want Eric to buy
you a diamond, but he says, "No."\\
135 - You just say,
"Why, are you busy?"\\
136 - Five minutes later,
you're Elizabeth Taylor.\\
137 - Yeah, I think I need advice from a woman
in a relationship not built on blackmail.\\
138 - It's called a lesbian, Donna,\\
139 - and you're going to have to
go to New York for that.\\
140 - This afternoon,
a cadet named Terry hit on me,\\
141 - and it makes me nervous
when men with guns like me.\\
142 - Fez, Cadet Terry is a woman.\\
143 - I know because I saw her
putting cover-up on her chin hair.\\
144 - Well, then,
hello there, Cadet Terry.\\
145 - I will sit here,\\
146 - but I will not partake.\\
147 - What you're doing is illegal,
and it could cause my mind\\
148 - to drift off its main goal,
which is enforcing the law.\\
149 - Now, I'd like you both
to read some literature.\\
150 - In particular, let's take a look
at "Be Great and Go Straight."\\
151 - I think that one
really says it all.\\
152 - Hey,
do not throw the literature!\\
153 - Kelso, the fact that you're now
totally lame would make me furious\\
154 - if I had the ability
to feel anger right now,\\
155 - which I thankfully don't.\\
156 - I am not lame. I am grown-up.\\
157 - And when you grow up,
you play by the rules,\\
158 - which is why I am
getting rid of this.\\
159 - What is he doing?
What is he doing?\\
160 - Don't worry, Fez.
He's just screwing around.\\
161 - What?\\
162 - Baggie!\\
163 - Good lord, he has broken you.\\
164 - You broke Hyde,
you son of a bitch!\\
165 - So, do you get what I'm saying?\\
166 - I think so.\\
167 - He was busy?\\
168 - In my house!\\
169 - I raised him better than that.\\
170 - I know this is weird, but I don't
have anyone else to talk to.\\
171 - Really, did you call around?
I could give you some numbers.\\
172 - No, no, no, I'm sorry.\\
173 - Okay, you and Eric need
to be able to talk about this.\\
174 - I'm sure it'll be awkward
at first, but, well, then...\\
175 - I am afraid it's just going to
be awkward all the way through.\\
176 - So, do you and Red have
these kinds of conversations?\\
177 - Oh, no, no, no, no.\\
178 - No, we don't talk
about stuff like this.\\
179 - Red can't even be naked
in a room with a mirror.\\
180 - Right.\\
181 - Well, I'm sure Eric and I
will be able to talk about this\\
182 - like we talk about everything,
because that's what you do.\\
183 - In an open, mature relationship,
you face things head on.\\
184 - - Oh, God!
- Dirty!\\
185 - Kelso, let us in.\\
186 - No, you're going
to hit me again.\\
187 - I'm warning you,
I got a C plus in Billy club.\\
188 - Just open the door!\\
189 - No.\\
190 - Damn, it's unlocked.\\
191 - I guess I'm going to
have to take you out.\\
192 - That's a nice move.\\
193 - Kelso, just relax.\\
194 - Now listen, we went on a walk.\\
195 - We realized you're trying to
start a new life for yourself here.\\
196 - We should be supportive.\\
197 - Really?\\
198 - Thank you.\\
199 - No, thank you, buddy.\\
200 - We're going to be
great and go straight.\\
201 - - You ready?
- You bet I am.\\
202 - Let's see you do QT in
the KP with this, you SOB.\\
203 - Morning.\\
204 - Well, if it isn't Casanova.\\
205 - The man who seduced himself.\\
206 - Oh, God.\\
207 - All right, hold it, hold it.
Come back here.\\
208 - Red, be nice.
Eric, don't be embarrassed.\\
209 - Now, you know that you can talk
to us about anything, so come on.\\
210 - Let's rap.\\
211 - When you were a baby,\\
212 - you had your hands down
your pants all the time.\\
213 - But that's okay,
because it's natural.\\
214 - Red, tell him it's natural.\\
215 - What are you, an animal?\\
216 - But why wouldn't
you lock the door?\\
217 - How could he lock the door when he's
in there pawing himself like an animal?\\
218 - You know, some people get addicted
and can't even hold down a job!\\
219 - If you can't get someone to
do it for you, you do without.\\
220 - In Korea, I went for
two and a half years.\\
221 - Dad, you were there for three.\\
222 - What are you, an animal?\\
223 - Hey.\\
224 - Oh, hey.\\
225 - Hey, why did you knock?\\
226 - You know why I knocked.\\
227 - Eric, you've been avoiding me
all day. Let's just talk about this.\\
228 - I... There's nothing
to talk about.\\
229 - You obviously thought you saw
something that you didn't see.\\
230 - I was checking for ticks.\\
231 - - Eric!
- Fine, okay, fine.\\
232 - I got caught. I'm embarrassed.\\
233 - Let's put this behind us.
I love you.\\
234 - Okay, great.
It's behind us. Absolutely.\\
235 - I said, "I love you."\\
236 - Mmm-hmm.\\
237 - Don't you love me, too?\\
238 - Sure, you know. Whatever.\\
239 - Can I have a hug?\\
240 - Fine.\\
241 - It's just, what got
you going at my house?\\
242 - I mean, we were just sitting
around, looking at pictures...\\
243 - Of Jackie's mom!
Jackie's mom got you going?\\
244 - No! What? No!\\
245 - Well...\\
246 - You're an animal!\\
247 - I can't wait for
these guys to see Kelso.\\
248 - I think I might be giddy.\\
249 - I know, I feel like
it's Christmas morning.\\
250 - Except, instead of toys, we
get to humiliate a close friend.\\
251 - Hey, Pete. Hey, Doug.\\
252 - Hey, boys.\\
253 - Hi, Mike!\\
254 - Cadet Mike, I suppose
you think this is funny?\\
255 - What?\\
256 - You have made a mockery
of the uniform,\\
257 - and I want an explanation
right now.\\
258 - Shut up!\\
259 - Dismissed!\\
260 - What did you guys do to me?\\
261 - Did you shave my head?\\
262 - Is there something on my back?\\
263 - You know what?\\
264 - You guys are totally
stuck in high school,\\
265 - and I'm trying to do something
better and you guys resent it,\\
266 - so you're trying
to ruin it for me.\\
267 - Well, you know what? This
stuff isn't even funny anymore.\\
268 - Oh, that's a good burn!\\
269 - So that's when I was, like,
"No, I don't want highlights."\\
270 - People pay money
to get their hair my color,\\
271 - not the other way around.\\
272 - Why are we feeding you again?\\
273 - 'Cause I'm good company.\\
274 - Look who tore himself away
from himself long enough to join us.\\
275 - Yeah, usually he's
too busy for lunch.\\
276 - All right, both of you stop.\\
277 - Honey, you washed
your hands, right?\\
278 - Look, Dad, I can't believe
I'm going to say this, but...\\
279 - Can I talk to you in
private for a moment?\\
280 - No, I don't think so.\\
281 - I know the kind of
things you do in private.\\
282 - - Dad...
- Oh, all right.\\
283 - Just keep your hands
where I can see them.\\
284 - This really isn't getting old.\\
285 - Okay. So, you know how
I do things that are horrible,\\
286 - and it seems like
I can't make them any worse,\\
287 - and then I do?\\
288 - Sadly, yes.\\
289 - Well, I did it again.\\
290 - Again?\\
291 - How many bathrooms
does that house have?\\
292 - No!\\
293 - Not... Not that.\\
294 - Donna wanted to talk
about the horrible thing.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - They always want
to talk about it.\\
297 - Yeah, well, we talked about it.\\
298 - And in the course of talking
about it, information was revealed\\
299 - that made it much, much worse.\\
300 - And that is why you never,
ever talk about it.\\
301 - Have you ever noticed how
often I just grunt at your mother?\\
302 - I know how to talk.
I'm not an ape.\\
303 - Right.\\
304 - I just choose not to.\\
305 - Right.\\
306 - Well, it's too late
for that now,\\
307 - since you screwed up
and talked about it.\\
308 - There's only one thing to do.\\
309 - Go on the offensive.
Counter attack.\\
310 - What? That's suicide, man.\\
311 - They'll never expect it.
It throws them off.\\
312 - You know, one time in Korea, we
had this little guy outnumbered 20-to-1.\\
313 - But then he ran at us,
screaming his head off.\\
314 - And we were so taken off guard,\\
315 - that we dove right
into our foxholes.\\
316 - - And he got away?
- No, no.\\
317 - No, I mean we were startled
for a few seconds,\\
318 - but then the whole company
just opened up on him.\\
319 - Listen up, Donna.
I've got something to say.\\
320 - Okay, but be careful.\\
321 - Jackie's mom was here earlier.\\
322 - I don't want you to catch
a whiff of her perfume\\
323 - and have to sexually assault
yourself in the hallway.\\
324 - No, no, no, no.
I talk, you listen.\\
325 - Okay, this is all your fault.\\
326 - Yeah, do you have any idea what
your celibacy thing is doing to me?\\
327 - My needs have risen
to near Fezian levels.\\
328 - He is a sick bastard, Donna,
and now, thanks to you, so am I!\\
329 - Yeah, that's right, Donna!
You created a monster.\\
330 - I can't leave myself alone!\\
331 - You know what?
You're right. I'm sorry.\\
332 - You are?\\
333 - I mean...\\
334 - Yeah, damn right you are.\\
335 - No, this has been really hard.\\
336 - And this celibacy
thing was my idea, so...\\
337 - I need to accept some responsibility
for the odd and disgusting things you do.\\
338 - That's right, you do.\\
339 - But, you know, next time,
be like a normal person.\\
340 - Go to your room, lock the
door, light some candles,\\
341 - put on some Al Green
and make an evening of it.\\
342 - Wow, Donna,
that was really detailed.\\
343 - It's almost like...\\
344 - Oh, my God!\\
345 - You do it, too!\\
346 - What? No, no!\\
347 - I'd noticed the candles
getting lower,\\
348 - even though I'd never
seen them lit!\\
349 - All right,
this conversation is over!\\
350 - Wow.\\
351 - So, this is where
it all happens.\\
352 - So they make an evening of it?\\
353 - Yeah, candles, music...\\
354 - God, girls do everything better.\\
355 - You don't suppose Jackie...\\
356 - Nah, she wouldn't even go
to a self-serve gas station.\\
357 - What would happen if I walked
in during one of their evenings?\\
358 - Are they like us where, even though
we're alone, we welcome a visitor?\\
359 - Well, yeah. I mean, it's not like
they'd rather do it themselves,\\
360 - when they could have
a man do it, right?\\
361 - - Right.
- Yeah.
\subsection {Episode 18: Do You Think It's Alright}
1 - Hey, Donna, when we
register for our wedding,\\
2 - can we register
for a trampoline?\\
3 - My mom won't let me
have a trampoline.\\
4 - If I'd known about registering
when I married Laurie,\\
5 - I would have registered for a wife
who wants to have sex with me.\\
6 - Eric, you know,
people only register for stuff\\
7 - that's used in serving, eating
and clearing of a meal.\\
8 - Why is it always about eating?\\
9 - Because marriage signifies
the end of trying to be attractive.\\
10 - Man, registering sucks.\\
11 - I had to register with Jackie
for her sweet sixteen.\\
12 - Longest five months of my life.\\
13 - Look, all I know is, you guys are gonna
buy whatever wedding present we tell you,\\
14 - and none of this
all-going-in-on-one-gift crap.\\
15 - Hey, hey, shut it, huh?\\
16 - No talk about weddings.
Jackie's on her way over.\\
17 - She's not here now.\\
18 - She doesn't have to hear
the word "wedding."\\
19 - She can sense that it was said.\\
20 - I wish I could do that.\\
21 - I mean, not so much with words,\\
22 - but so that I could see
through people's clothes.\\
23 - Look, you two start yapping
about your wedding,\\
24 - Jackie gets all, "Steven,
when are we getting married?"\\
25 - Then I have to say
we're not getting married,\\
26 - and then she
kicks me in my shins.\\
27 - From the knees down,
I'm like a freaking POW.\\
28 - No, you have magnificent legs.\\
29 - I would say W-O-W.\\
30 - Wow.\\
31 - May I help...\\
32 - Oh, it's you.\\
33 - Hello, Fenton.\\
34 - You two know each other?\\
35 - Yeah, this is the weirdo
who sold me your ring.\\
36 - He's probably worn
it more than you.\\
37 - Well, maybe she doesn't want
to wear it because it's from you.\\
38 - Well, maybe you need to keep
your nose out of my business!\\
39 - Trust me, your business is the
last place I wanna put my nose!\\
40 - - I'm sorry, man. I am.
- Me, too.\\
41 - - We're here to
register for our wedding.
- Oh, wonderful.\\
42 - - And I see we're
starting with silverware.
- Yes, I like this one.\\
43 - No, Eric, the wedding book says
we can't pick the first thing we see.\\
44 - Oh, well, in that case, yeah,
the first one... Eh!\\
45 - Second one, whoo-hoo!
All right!\\
46 - Let's wrap it up,
hit the food court.\\
47 - Here's a small sampling
from our collection.\\
48 - Prestige, Exhilaration and,
my personal favorite, Brash.\\
49 - Oh!\\
50 - Well, Fenton, you may be surprised
to learn that your personal favorite\\
51 - is not our personal favorite.\\
52 - But, anyway, we're done.\\
53 - No, Eric, the wedding book says
that we have to look at all the patterns.\\
54 - Today is just a scouting trip.\\
55 - Scouting?\\
56 - You know, I was asked
to resign from the Scouts.\\
57 - Look, it's kind of like...\\
58 - Okay, remember before we
were together and we dated,\\
59 - like, all those different people
before we decided on each other?\\
60 - No, not really. No.\\
61 - Eric, come on.
This is supposed to be fun.\\
62 - Okay, look at
the groom in this picture.\\
63 - What is the difference
between you and him?\\
64 - He's a cartoon?\\
65 - No, he is smiling.\\
66 - Yeah, because he's a cartoon.\\
67 - Look, these are all
the forks I have here.\\
68 - I'll have to bring the rest up from
storage. I guess I'll need a forklift. Oh!\\
69 - Whoo!\\
70 - Oh, I made a funny.\\
71 - Well, it's a... It's a good
thing we have all day.\\
72 - All day? What...\\
73 - I'm not spending all day
in a department store.\\
74 - I'm gonna turn into him.\\
75 - Okay, you're not as
far away as you think.\\
76 - Okay, that's it. I'm going to
the sporting goods department.\\
77 - Men.\\
78 - You can't live with them...
Well, you can.\\
79 - But you have to
keep quiet about it.\\
80 - Hanging out\\
81 - Down the street\\
82 - The same old thing\\
83 - We did last week\\
84 - Not a thing to do\\
85 - But talk to you\\
86 - We're all all right\\
87 - We're all all right\\
88 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
89 - Reading another one
of your dirty girl books?\\
90 - They're not dirty,
they're romantic.\\
91 - "Mutiny From Behind."\\
92 - Yeah.
The mutiny sneaks up on her.\\
93 - I don't think
that's what it means.\\
94 - Well, it is a wonderful book. It's
got pirates and action. Oh, oh, oh!\\
95 - It has this hilarious parrot that
says the most inappropriate things.\\
96 - "The pirate's vessel slowly sailed
into the harbor of San Sebastian island.\\
97 - "His saucy prisoner's alabaster
breasts heaving with every motion\\
98 - "of the tall, rigid ship."\\
99 - San Sebastian island.\\
100 - I think I killed
some commies there.\\
101 - I just spent six hours
registering for wedding gifts.\\
102 - The only reason I'm here now is I
pretended to choke on ice cream.\\
103 - I'll let you in on a little secret for
when you're shopping with women.\\
104 - Always pick the ugliest, worst
choice, and you're off the hook.\\
105 - That's how I got out of
shopping for this couch.\\
106 - There was
an uglier couch than this?\\
107 - The one I picked
had dragons on it.\\
108 - Wow, you're sneaky.\\
109 - You know, you act like
you're all about brute force,\\
110 - but you're
a finesse player, man.\\
111 - Trust me, son.\\
112 - Don't budge until you
hear the magic words,\\
113 - "Oh, I'll just do it myself."\\
114 - You're done registering already?\\
115 - You men, you just
don't know how to shop.\\
116 - You know, your father once tried to
get me to buy a couch with dragons on it.\\
117 - Yeah,
I guess I'm just bad at it.\\
118 - What do you think of this fork?\\
119 - Donna, I think all this stuff is
too ordinary for us, you know?\\
120 - Let's get something bejeweled.\\
121 - Who are you, Liberace?\\
122 - Yes, I'm Liberace.\\
123 - Eric, this wedding is...\\
124 - - Hey, guys. What's up?
- Oh, hey.\\
125 - We were just talking about slutty
cheerleaders in other schools.\\
126 - You never want
to talk about that.\\
127 - Well, I've finally
come around, darling.\\
128 - Are those
wedding gift catalogs?\\
129 - Damn it.\\
130 - - For our wedding,
Steven and I...
- Jackie, no.\\
131 - - Steven, we have to...
- No.\\
132 - - A good bride and groom...
- That's it. You're done.\\
133 - Now why didn't someone do that
five years ago?\\
134 - She used to bite.\\
135 - Now this, okay. This is
what I'm talking about.\\
136 - That's a nice fork.\\
137 - Eric, the handle is
an actual deer hoof.\\
138 - Yeah, that's
the Cherokee collection.\\
139 - Donna, that's the Indian way.\\
140 - They kill the animal,
then eat it with its own paw.\\
141 - Okay, you know what?
I have a new plan.\\
142 - I'll just go shopping, and
then I'll show you what I pick.\\
143 - So I don't get to go at all?\\
144 - No. I'll just...
I'll just do it myself.\\
145 - Yeah,
I guess I'm just bad at it.\\
146 - "After throwing the evil
pirate king overboard,\\
147 - "the Duke turned to Lady Daphne,\\
148 - "pulled his sword from
its sheath and held it erect.\\
149 - "Lady Daphne
touched it tentatively,\\
150 - "and a shudder went
through the Duke."\\
151 - So you like those books,
too, Mr. Red?\\
152 - All right, fine. So you know.\\
153 - But you tell one person,
and so help me God,\\
154 - I will chop down
whatever tree you live in.\\
155 - So I was daydreaming\\
156 - during this civil rights
lecture at the police academy,\\
157 - and I came up with a great idea
for an invention, adult strollers.\\
158 - Why walk when
someone can push you?\\
159 - Kelso, that's a wheelchair.\\
160 - All right, it's official.
Everything's been thought of!\\
161 - - All right, what do
you think of this fork?
- No, no, no.\\
162 - You're not gonna rope me
into that. Just make Eric do it.\\
163 - No, Eric's banned from doing it.\\
164 - He actually wanted me to
eat dinner with Bambi's foot.\\
165 - What is this,
the Cherokee collection?\\
166 - Oh, well, he picked the ugliest one
so you wouldn't make him go shopping.\\
167 - It's classic.\\
168 - I knew something was fishy.
He's terrified of Indians.\\
169 - Oh, he's gonna pay for this.\\
170 - He thought he had a
bad time the other day.\\
171 - He doesn't know
what a bad time is.\\
172 - I am gonna stop
having sex with him.\\
173 - Oh, crap, I already did that.\\
174 - All right, look, I hate to sell him
out, but the poor kid lacks subtlety.\\
175 - He's... Eric's... How do I
put... He's a bit of a rube.\\
176 - You know,
like, a little country.\\
177 - A maroon, if you will.\\
178 - Kelso, what's your point?\\
179 - Well, I'm just saying you could do
better. I mean, I'm here, you're here.\\
180 - Nobody has to know.\\
181 - - Kelso!
- Okay, fine,
you can tell two friends.\\
182 - So I invested $11 in
Kelso's adult stroller idea.\\
183 - I'm going to be a millionaire.\\
184 - Really? So if I buy one, like,
who's gonna push me around?\\
185 - Trained bears.\\
186 - Kelso's got it all figured
out. I'm just the money man.\\
187 - Hey, guys, where's Donna?\\
188 - I found this place that etches
your silhouette on your china.\\
189 - Oh! We are so doing that
when we get married.\\
190 - Steven, people can
eat right off my face.\\
191 - Then guess who's
coming to dinner.\\
192 - Jackie,
you're driving me insane.\\
193 - Look, I want you to
make me a promise.\\
194 - You will not talk about weddings
or anything wedding-related\\
195 - in or around the United States.\\
196 - Fine, I won't talk about weddings
or anything wedding-related\\
197 - in or around
the continental United States.\\
198 - Not
the continental United States.\\
199 - We're talking
Hawaii and Alaska, too.\\
200 - Fine, but if we're ever in
Canada, I am going nuts!\\
201 - Eric, bad news.\\
202 - A deejay at the radio station got sick,
so I have to cover his shift all week.\\
203 - I'm not gonna be able
to register for wedding gifts.\\
204 - Oh, no. Well, I guess
we'll just have to live\\
205 - with whatever forks
come in the mail willy-nilly.\\
206 - Well, actually, you're gonna
have to shop for everything.\\
207 - Wait, wait, wait.
Back up here.\\
208 - Who are you calling willy-nilly?\\
209 - Look, Donna, I can't shop.\\
210 - I have horrible taste, remember?\\
211 - "I guess I'm just bad at it."\\
212 - You are almost
unbelievably bad at it.\\
213 - And that's why I've decided
Jackie will go shopping with you.\\
214 - Yes!\\
215 - No, no, no.\\
216 - You promised Hyde that you
wouldn't do any more wedding stuff.\\
217 - Yeah, but here's
the thing about me. I lie.\\
218 - So today we'll be
looking at crystal.\\
219 - You see how all the different colors
intermingle without any judgment?\\
220 - See that?\\
221 - Yeah, okay, move over,
Tony Randall. I'm in charge.\\
222 - Today,
we'll be looking at china.\\
223 - I see you let the redhead go.\\
224 - I can't say I'm an expert on
women, but I think you traded up.\\
225 - Okay, I will lay out
four possible choices.\\
226 - You will then choose your
favorite. I will disregard that\\
227 - and choose the correct one.\\
228 - So what will I be doing?\\
229 - Oh, you will be holding
my purse and eating candy.\\
230 - All right.\\
231 - Here, make the Sugar Daddy last.\\
232 - Oh, if only someone had given
me that advice four years ago.\\
233 - This spice rack is a real mess.\\
234 - It's like someone got drunk
and put everything out of order.\\
235 - I mean, cayenne pepper,
cumin, celery salt? It's insanity!\\
236 - Oh, Duke, I'd like to
show you my coconuts.\\
237 - Well, give me
a minute to raise my mast,\\
238 - and then we can
really make some waves.\\
239 - Not so fast!\\
240 - If anyone's making
waves around here, it's me.\\
241 - I'm trained in judo,
hapkido and karate.\\
242 - I can also talk about
you behind your back.\\
243 - And when it gets back to you,
it'll really sting.\\
244 - So prepare to die.\\
245 - You know,
Kitty, Eric's not home.\\
246 - We have the whole
upstairs to ourselves.\\
247 - Would have been thinking
about that the whole time.\\
248 - Okay. I got another invention.\\
249 - Bicycles with engines.\\
250 - That's a motorcycle.\\
251 - Okay, fine.
Bicycles without engines.\\
252 - That's a bicycle.\\
253 - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but it's got the chair on it.\\
254 - And we're back to wheelchair.\\
255 - Okay, Eric just called,
and he's having fun shopping.\\
256 - All right,
with me, it's torture,\\
257 - but when I send him to
pick out wedding gifts with J...\\
258 - Pick out wedding gifts with who?\\
259 - Um...\\
260 - Jehoshaphat.\\
261 - Remember him from school?
He was always,\\
262 - you know, jumping.\\
263 - You sent Forman out to do
wedding stuff with Jackie?\\
264 - Look, I had to punish him,\\
265 - and what better way than to make
him spend the day with Jackie?\\
266 - She's got you there.\\
267 - I mean,
your girlfriend is annoying.\\
268 - Plus, I used to do it with her
all the time, so that's gotta hurt.\\
269 - Man, I thought I had this
wedding crap taken care of.\\
270 - Now I gotta go down to the mall.\\
271 - And Three's Company
is about to start.\\
272 - This day's gone all to hell!\\
273 - What happened
to my favorite blouse?\\
274 - A lady never talks about
what happens in the bedroom.\\
275 - Ah, looks like Red picked up some
tricks from the Duke in Mutiny From Behind.\\
276 - He read my dirty girl book?\\
277 - Yes, I caught him.\\
278 - Ironically, from behind.\\
279 - See, Eric, this is
the perfect tux for you.\\
280 - It makes you look like you
actually have shoulders.\\
281 - You know, I do look
like I have shoulders.\\
282 - - Why are you
wearing a wedding dress?
- Oh, I do this every week.\\
283 - Come here.\\
284 - What the hell?\\
285 - - I cannot believe
what I'm seeing.
- I know. Look, shoulders.\\
286 - Eric, this was
supposed to be our time.\\
287 - Donna, wait!\\
288 - Okay, Steven, I know I promised
I wouldn't do any wedding stuff,\\
289 - and I know you're probably really
mad, so just go ahead and yell.\\
290 - You're beautiful.\\
291 - Oh, my God.\\
292 - You like me in a wedding dress,\\
293 - which means that someday
we're gonna get married,\\
294 - which means that I can
talk about it. Oh, Steven!\\
295 - Okay, I want a spring wedding
outside with white doves,\\
296 - and I want the sun to be
setting behind me\\
297 - so that I have a halo,
kind of like an angel.\\
298 - Oh, and then, wild mustangs can
take us to our honeymoon in Hawaii!\\
299 - Oh, but your family can't come.\\
300 - Oh, you know what? You
can run, but you can't hide!\\
301 - I know where you live!\\
302 - Donna, what's the matter?\\
303 - You picked a deer-foot fork just
to get out of shopping with me.\\
304 - Oh, too obvious, huh?\\
305 - Yeah, no one wants
hairy silverware.\\
306 - I just don't understand how you could
have more fun with Jackie than with me.\\
307 - I don't know. I mean, you know,
she doesn't ask me questions.\\
308 - She just tells me what to do.\\
309 - It's a strange kind of freedom,\\
310 - but I know why the
caged bird sings, Donna.\\
311 - So you're saying the way to handle
you is just take away your free will\\
312 - and order you around?\\
313 - Donna,
that's the way I was raised.\\
314 - Eric, I can't tell you what to do
because I don't even know what to do.\\
315 - I mean, that's why I
got that stupid book.\\
316 - I hate that book. Kelso was right.
Reading just gets you into trouble.\\
317 - Forks don't matter to me,
Eric. I mean, they don't.\\
318 - They don't.\\
319 - In 20 years, food's just
gonna be a little pill anyway.\\
320 - Look, let's just do this
whole wedding thing our way.\\
321 - Yes.\\
322 - What's our way?\\
323 - I don't know.\\
324 - Maybe we should ask Jackie.\\
325 - You're back with that one?\\
326 - Good luck.\\
327 - "The Adventures of Lydia
and Master Bates."\\
328 - "Master Bates had lived alone
on an island for years,\\
329 - "with only
himself for company."\\
330 - I should give this
one to the foreign kid.
\subsection {Episode 19: Substitute}
1 - Yeah, nice.\\
2 - So yesterday I'm at this garage
sale, I look down, and there it was.\\
3 - The Darth Vader action figure with
the incredibly rare green light saber.\\
4 - How have I not
kicked your ass yet?\\
5 - - Fore!
- Whoa!\\
6 - - Watch out!
- Parking lot!\\
7 - It was just a Pinto.\\
8 - Fez, this is Putt-Putt.\\
9 - Your choices are putt or putt.\\
10 - Hey, what the hell?\\
11 - Oh, Forman. Yeah, I should've
known it was you guys.\\
12 - Most people that come here
can't hit the ball that hard\\
13 - on account of
they're in kindergarten.\\
14 - Mitch, congratulations.\\
15 - This seems like the perfect
job for someone your size,\\
16 - what with the free lodging
and the little castle on hole six.\\
17 - Yeah, there's just enough room
in there for me and your mom.\\
18 - Yeah, the sweetest burns
involve doing it with your mom.\\
19 - Look, just quit hitting the ball that
hard or you guys are out of here.\\
20 - What are you... No.\\
21 - God, I hate that guy.\\
22 - Tear him a new hole-in-one.\\
23 - Wow, Forman,
I haven't seen you this pissed\\
24 - since I chased you around your
house with that spider in a jar.\\
25 - You were like,
"Hyde, I swear to God!"\\
26 - Then you never did anything.\\
27 - Yeah?
I'm about to do something.\\
28 - Hanging out\\
29 - Down the street\\
30 - The same old thing\\
31 - We did last week\\
32 - Not a thing to do\\
33 - But talk to you\\
34 - We're all all right\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
37 - No, I don't know how to do that.\\
38 - Mitch, I'm so sorry.\\
39 - What?\\
40 - I've lost the ability to process language
on account of I have a concussion.\\
41 - There's more bad news.\\
42 - When you return to the course,
you're gonna find that some punk\\
43 - drew boobs and a butt crack
on the clown statue.\\
44 - And don't try to wash it off
'cause I used permanent marker.\\
45 - Forman,
why are we always fighting?\\
46 - I can't even remember
how we got this way.\\
47 - I think a chick
said that to me once.\\
48 - No, that was me.\\
49 - Don't you think that
we should be friends?\\
50 - Okay, well, you...\\
51 - You're obviously having some
kind of reaction to your medications.\\
52 - We're just gonna go.\\
53 - You know, Mitch, if you ever want to
come hang out in the basement, you know...\\
54 - Really? Thanks.\\
55 - I'd smile, but the left side of
my face is kind of paralyzed.\\
56 - Forman,
why'd you invite him over?\\
57 - You were almost out of there
and you turned back around.\\
58 - Look, yeah, Forman,\\
59 - there's only two times in life
that you turn back around,\\
60 - basketball and runway modeling.\\
61 - No, and square dancing.\\
62 - It's called a do-si-do.\\
63 - Look,
Mitch knows I didn't mean it.\\
64 - Hey, Eric.\\
65 - Mitch.\\
66 - I can't believe you got a hold of the
Darth Vader with the green light saber.\\
67 - What? No, no, it's...\\
68 - What a geek.\\
69 - Wow, I love this place.\\
70 - It's not just dinner.
It's a thrill ride,\\
71 - 'cause there's a small chance
you're getting knifed.\\
72 - I don't know, Bob.\\
73 - I've tried to avoid Asians with weapons
ever since 7,000 of them tried to kill me.\\
74 - Well...\\
75 - It's thanks to the work
of brave men like you\\
76 - that America's enemies are
working here for a minimum wage.\\
77 - Oh!\\
78 - Mom, would you please stop
playing with his hair?\\
79 - You don't know where it's been.\\
80 - I think a good dinnertime policy might be
everybody feeds and grooms themselves.\\
81 - Oh, oh! And speaking
of grooming, Pamela,\\
82 - I noticed that your skirt was
torn all the way up to your thigh.\\
83 - No, I actually
bought it this way.\\
84 - See, most skirts
are only slit up to the knee,\\
85 - but I think people want
to see more than that.\\
86 - Hear, hear!\\
87 - Here comes the waiter.\\
88 - I'm glad you're all here to help
me celebrate this very special time\\
89 - with this very special lady.\\
90 - Oh, Bob, it means a lot to me
that you realize how special I am.\\
91 - I do. That's why I want to
ask you to move in with me.\\
92 - - Oh, my God.
- What?\\
93 - Gosh, Bob, that's really sweet
and I'd really love to,\\
94 - but I'm seeing someone else.\\
95 - Sorry.\\
96 - But you'll still
come visit, right?\\
97 - Clowns to the left of me\\
98 - Jokers to the right,
here I am\\
99 - Stuck in
the middle with you\\
100 - What are you doing?\\
101 - I'm not touching you.\\
102 - Well, stop it.\\
103 - But I'm not touching you.\\
104 - Well, stop not touching me.\\
105 - Okay.\\
106 - Wasn't it better
when I wasn't touching you?\\
107 - Yeah.\\
108 - They look happy.
Why don't we have a game?\\
109 - Would you stop asking me
why don't we have stuff?\\
110 - "Why don't we have a song?"
"Why don't we have a movie?"\\
111 - We're men.\\
112 - I thought we were sensitive men.\\
113 - We're not.\\
114 - One of us is.\\
115 - Shut up!\\
116 - And it's not you.\\
117 - Well, Mitch, I'll tell you what.\\
118 - It's been really fun having you
over, but it's almost sundown,\\
119 - and we celebrate the Sabbath,
so unless you have your...\\
120 - Your... Your little beanie,\\
121 - then I guess we're gonna have
to say adios or shalom, as we say.\\
122 - You guys are Jewish?\\
123 - I'm Jewish!\\
124 - Wow, you are gorgeous.\\
125 - Are you kidding me? No, no,
no, no, I'm the pretty one. Me.\\
126 - You're the hottest
redhead since Batgirl.\\
127 - And you're not just gorgeous.\\
128 - I mean, you radiate intelligence
and deep thought, a real sense of self.\\
129 - Eric, I like your new friend.\\
130 - She's gotta be with you, huh?\\
131 - I can't say I haven't tried,
my little friend,\\
132 - but she's with Eric for now.\\
133 - Really?\\
134 - Well, what's wrong with her? Is
she, like, an alcoholic or a drug addict?\\
135 - Yeah. Yeah, she's addicted.\\
136 - She needs a daily
dose of this guy.\\
137 - I just think it's pretty suspicious that
after we left the Japanese restaurant\\
138 - our Japanese car broke down.\\
139 - Hey, buddy.\\
140 - Whoa, Eric, you didn't tell me
you had an older sister.\\
141 - Please, if you're gonna go with fake charm,
let's keep it in the realm of reality, okay?\\
142 - You shut your porky mouth.\\
143 - I have the skin of a 25-year-old\\
144 - who smokes.\\
145 - You know, Mr. Forman, I learned
a little about cars from my uncle\\
146 - who used to fix
tanks in Vietnam.\\
147 - Now that's hero's work,\\
148 - fixing machines that kill
people you don't agree with.\\
149 - My only regret is that I haven't
had a chance to fight for my country.\\
150 - Really?\\
151 - Eric's only regret is
that he doesn't live in space.\\
152 - That's not my only regret.\\
153 - It's just one of them.\\
154 - Excellent Fruity Pebbles.\\
155 - You know, at the police academy
they'll only give me corn flakes,\\
156 - 'cause they say the sugar gets
me too hopped up to carry a weapon.\\
157 - I guess what they
weren't counting on\\
158 - was me taking my weapon home
for the weekend.\\
159 - My poor dad.
You know, he's so upset.\\
160 - This morning during
The Price is Right\\
161 - he didn't even yodel along
during "Cliffhanger."\\
162 - Donna, we wanted them apart,
and now they are.\\
163 - Look, some things
just don't belong together,\\
164 - like my mom and your dad,
or Michael and a gun.\\
165 - No, seriously,
how could they give me a gun?\\
166 - You don't even
sound like you feel bad.\\
167 - Donna, this whole
thing is your dad's fault.\\
168 - Come on, Donna.\\
169 - Who asked the woman
to move in with him\\
170 - after knowing her
for such a short time?\\
171 - I'll tell you who.\\
172 - The same guy who let you move
in here after your parents took off\\
173 - and you had no place
else to go. My dad.\\
174 - I mean, you know your mom is
wrong and that she hurt my dad,\\
175 - who's never been anything
but nice to you.\\
176 - How can you defend her?\\
177 - I pick the pretty one.\\
178 - Hey, Dad. How you doing?\\
179 - How do you think I'm doing?\\
180 - Pam ripped out my heart and
stomped on it in shoes I paid for.\\
181 - Well, do you want to go down to
the pet store and look at puppies?\\
182 - You could sing How Much
Is that Doggie in the Window?\\
183 - And I'll do the "Arf!
Arf!" part.\\
184 - Nah, I'm gonna watch Love Boat.\\
185 - I think the big guy in the shorts is finally
gonna nail the girl with the clipboard.\\
186 - Yeah!\\
187 - I'm sorry. That's the sugar.\\
188 - My best
friend's girlfriend\\
189 - Okay, Kelso, truth or dare?\\
190 - Truth.\\
191 - Have you ever snuck into
my bathroom while I was showering?\\
192 - I mean, dare.\\
193 - You have snuck in there.
I was there and I saw you.\\
194 - I mean, dare.\\
195 - Okay, Steven, truth or dare?\\
196 - The truth will be whether
or not you love me,\\
197 - and the dare will be
telling me that you love me.\\
198 - Okay.\\
199 - Pass.\\
200 - Okay, Mitch, truth or dare?\\
201 - I pick dare, Mitch.\\
202 - Okay, Mitch,
I dare you to kiss Donna.\\
203 - Mitch, naughty Mitch.\\
204 - Mitch, you goofball,
that's not how it works.\\
205 - You have to be like,
"I dare you to kiss me."\\
206 - Okay.\\
207 - What the hell!\\
208 - He did it!\\
209 - Look at him go.
He's like a hummingbird.\\
210 - I can't believe
Mitch would do that.\\
211 - He just flew at you like one of the
little monkeys from The Wizard of Oz.\\
212 - I was scared.\\
213 - Much like you are when
you watch The Wizard of Oz.\\
214 - Okay, look, I don't want Mitch
hanging out here anymore.\\
215 - He was just fooling around.
He didn't mean anything by it.\\
216 - It's like Fez. He's all over me all the
time, but it doesn't mean he's after me.\\
217 - Yes, it does.\\
218 - From now on,
I'll try to be clearer.\\
219 - Mom, there you are.\\
220 - How could you do that to Bob?\\
221 - - Now, honey, Bob will be fine.
- No, he won't.\\
222 - Mom, Bob is a wonderful guy
with a huge heart\\
223 - who only worries about what
he could do for other people.\\
224 - And, yeah,
okay, maybe he has an afro.\\
225 - But sometimes goodness
and afros go together.\\
226 - But, Jackie, the other guy that
I'm seeing is a Lincoln dealer.\\
227 - Oh, my God, Mom, really?\\
228 - Mom, we could be driving
in matching pink...\\
229 - No, no. Mom, no. No.\\
230 - Okay, look, I know...\\
231 - I know that Bob might not be
the smoothest or the classiest guy\\
232 - you've ever dated, but I've learned
that doesn't mean he's a bad person.\\
233 - Ugh, I knew I shouldn't
have sent you to public school.\\
234 - Mom, if you keep thinking this
way, you'll always be running\\
235 - from one place to another
looking for something better\\
236 - instead of just being happy
with what you have.\\
237 - You know what? I guess
you have a lot of thinking to do.\\
238 - You're right.
Mas tequila, Hirohito.\\
239 - I said, "Thinking."\\
240 - Hello? Is anyone here?\\
241 - Hyde?\\
242 - Well, I guess it's time for me and 24
of my collectible action figure friends.\\
243 - It was a dark
time for the Force.\\
244 - After the Formanian wars,\\
245 - young Luke Skywalker had to
face his most formidable enemy yet.\\
246 - Darth Vader with the rare
and deadlier green light saber.\\
247 - What? No.\\
248 - Mitch!\\
249 - Mitch,
these omelets are amazing.\\
250 - Well, you know, an omelet's only
as beautiful as the person who eats it,\\
251 - so, I'd have to say that this omelet
has the prettiest red hair I've ever seen.\\
252 - Thief! He's a thief.\\
253 - You stole my
Vader action figure.\\
254 - You, too?\\
255 - I thought Eric was the only one
weird enough to play with a doll.\\
256 - Action figure.\\
257 - You know, it's bad enough you stole
a kiss from my girlfriend, but this...\\
258 - This has gone too far.\\
259 - So my honor
is less important than a doll?\\
260 - Action figure!\\
261 - Now give it back.\\
262 - Hold on just a second.\\
263 - Now,
Mitch, did you or did you not\\
264 - put onions in my omelet?\\
265 - 'Cause I asked for them, but I
didn't see you put them in there.\\
266 - Eric, I didn't take
your action figure.\\
267 - - Doll.
- Action figure!\\
268 - I wouldn't do that,
especially not to a friend.\\
269 - What? We're not friends, man.\\
270 - We never were. I only invited you
over here 'cause I felt bad for you,\\
271 - but I don't like you. And guess
what? Neither does anyone else.\\
272 - Fine.\\
273 - I won't bother you guys anymore.\\
274 - And somebody needs to flip
that in about three minutes!\\
275 - Well, that was brutal.
I feel bad for the little guy.\\
276 - I just wanna put him up on my
shoulders and buy him a balloon.\\
277 - Eric, how could you?\\
278 - Mitch had a lot
of good qualities,\\
279 - like, for example,
he worshiped me.\\
280 - I mean, at one point, I thought he was
gonna light a fire and dance around me.\\
281 - Yeah, well, you know what? I
was right, okay? He's a thief.\\
282 - Eric, were you playing in
the bathtub with your little doll?\\
283 - Action figure!\\
284 - Oh, no.\\
285 - In the tub, Forman?\\
286 - It is getting really
hard to be your friend.\\
287 - Okay, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming back here with me.\\
288 - True, it is the place
of my greatest humiliation.\\
289 - But the fish is good,
the sake's strong,\\
290 - and these Japanese people
are funny to watch.\\
291 - That's the spirit, Dad.\\
292 - The slightly offensive spirit.\\
293 - Well, you know, I think you're lucky
to be rid of Pam with her halter tops\\
294 - and her tight skirts.\\
295 - You know, I've never even
seen a panty line on her.\\
296 - You know what that means.\\
297 - Plus, you're too
nice for my mom anyway.\\
298 - You know,
someday you're gonna make\\
299 - a slightly less-attractive
woman very happy.\\
300 - Hello, Bob.\\
301 - No, it's not a beautiful
dream, it's really me.\\
302 - I've been doing
some thinking, Bob,\\
303 - and I realized that my
priorities are a little mixed up.\\
304 - I told her that. That was me.
I saved the day!\\
305 - It doesn't matter
how it happened.\\
306 - The important thing
is she's back in our lives.\\
307 - Anyway, Bob, I realized
that you're the man for me.\\
308 - I'm sorry, Pam. It's too late.\\
309 - I'm completely over you.
O-V-E-R. Over.\\
310 - - And I want to
move in with you.
- Here's your key.\\
311 - Dad? Are you sure
this is a good idea?\\
312 - She makes me happy, kitten.\\
313 - Fine.\\
314 - But I don't want to see, like, any of
her panties laying around the house.\\
315 - Don't worry. You won't.\\
316 - Hey, Mitch.\\
317 - Look, I wanted to apologize.\\
318 - I thought you stole my Vader,
but it turns out I left it in the...\\
319 - Hyde stole it.\\
320 - Yeah, I guess I
was out of line, too.\\
321 - I shouldn't have
jumped on your girlfriend\\
322 - in front of you.\\
323 - It's just,
you have such a great life.\\
324 - And if I never see you
or your friends ever again,\\
325 - I'm always gonna treasure
that time that I spent with Donna.\\
326 - Okay, well,
then I'll just say goodbye.\\
327 - So lonely.\\
328 - Hey, Mitch,\\
329 - you know, if you ever want to
hang out, you know, you're always...\\
330 - - You know...
- Great. Thanks.\\
331 - - Are we gonna do this now?
- Yeah, buddy, let's do it!\\
332 - - Okay.
- All right.\\
333 - Hey, so do you think I might
have a shot with Donna?\\
334 - - Mitch, she's my fiancee.
- So that's a maybe.\\
335 - Oh, Pamela, hi.\\
336 - I just came here
to get my scarf.\\
337 - Oh! Here it is.\\
338 - You thought you lost your scarf.
That must have made you nervous.\\
339 - - Would you like a drink?
- Well,
it's a little early, but...\\
340 - It's probably 5:00 somewhere.\\
341 - Two Saigon Slammers,
hold the fruit.\\
342 - First round's on me.\\
343 - That's okay. I have a tab.
\subsection {Episode 20: Squeezebox}
1 - You know, before we decided
not to have sex...\\
2 - You decided.\\
3 - I'm ready.\\
4 - Right, I decided.\\
5 - Movies were just a dark place
to fool around\\
6 - before we went home and did it,\\
7 - but now we can
really watch the movie.\\
8 - Isn't that great?\\
9 - It's fabulous.\\
10 - There's nothing I hate more than
the feeling that I'm about to have sex.\\
11 - Hi.\\
12 - Hi!\\
13 - Hey!\\
14 - Hi!\\
15 - Okay!\\
16 - Isn't that the girl
who sells Slurpees?\\
17 - Why is she saying hi to you?\\
18 - I don't know. It's weird. I've
never talked to her before.\\
19 - I mean, maybe one time I said,\\
20 - "You're out of spoon straws,"
but that's it.\\
21 - Great. Now I have to sit
through Kramer vs. Kramer again\\
22 - with no shot at nookie.\\
23 - First time we saw it, I said,\\
24 - "You know, dads can
be good parents, too,"\\
25 - and Donna's shirt
just floated off.\\
26 - What is wrong with me?\\
27 - A boy's gonna lose his mother, and
all I can think about is fooling around.\\
28 - I am such a dirty girl.\\
29 - I should be spanked.
Oh, stop it!\\
30 - Screw it.
Sneak attack is my only hope.\\
31 - I'm gonna go with
the yawn and grab.\\
32 - Watch out for my hand, pretty
mama, 'cause I'm not really tired.\\
33 - Oh, God.
It's the yawn and grab.\\
34 - How do I stop him?\\
35 - Oops.\\
36 - Oh, sorry.\\
37 - Oh, come on. It's okay.\\
38 - Great. Now my lap's
covered in hot buttered popcorn.\\
39 - That's the most action
I've gotten in weeks.\\
40 - Thanks for helping move
Pam into my house, Kitty.\\
41 - You know what they say,
"Lady number three is a charm."\\
42 - You have been so
warm and friendly.\\
43 - You simply must teach me
how to be like that.\\
44 - Pam, I'd just like to say
on behalf of Fez and myself,\\
45 - that it is a privilege and a
turn-on to carry your underthings.\\
46 - And you don't have to pay me.\\
47 - I took a few souvenirs.\\
48 - Well, enjoy.\\
49 - Red, I'd help you with the boxes,
but I don't want to tire myself out.\\
50 - I'm gonna be up all night
welcoming Pam to the house.\\
51 - Okay, see you later.
Have fun, close your shades.\\
52 - What do we do with these boxes?\\
53 - Let's just stick them in there.\\
54 - Hi, boys.\\
55 - Hanging out\\
56 - Down the street\\
57 - The same old thing\\
58 - We did last week\\
59 - Not a thing to do\\
60 - But talk to you\\
61 - We're all all right\\
62 - We're all all right\\
63 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
64 - Mitch, what are you doing here?\\
65 - I made a peach
cobbler for Donna,\\
66 - and I forgot to leave it
when I was in here last night.\\
67 - You weren't in here last night.\\
68 - Well, not as far as you know.\\
69 - Okay, look, Mitch, I know
you're in love with her,\\
70 - but it's not gonna work out.\\
71 - You're as big as
you're gonna get.\\
72 - And trust me, okay?
Donna's still growing.\\
73 - Jackie, we need to talk.\\
74 - Eric and I came
really close to doing it,\\
75 - and I am so jacked up on hormones, I
feel like I could jump the first guy I see.\\
76 - Then look my way, pretty lady.\\
77 - Okay, Mitch, you know I
love having you around,\\
78 - 'cause you say
really nice things about me...\\
79 - Like how the sun pales in
radiance to the beauty of your smile?\\
80 - - Yeah, like that.
- Yeah.\\
81 - But I have to talk to Jackie,
and it's girl stuff.\\
82 - You're so strong.\\
83 - You make me feel like
Jessica Lange in King Kong.\\
84 - Hey, Red. "Hi, boys!"\\
85 - I could kill you
without making a sound.\\
86 - You know, I'm worried
we don't have enough chicken\\
87 - for dinner tonight.\\
88 - Do these breasts
look big enough?\\
89 - I'm not comfortable
with that question.\\
90 - - What?
- What?\\
91 - What?\\
92 - What are you laughing at?\\
93 - Just life. It's a hoot.\\
94 - Well, I don't know
what's in that orange juice,\\
95 - but I'm gonna
pour myself a glass.\\
96 - Red, what I want to know is,
what did Pam mean...\\
97 - Not here... Toyota.\\
98 - This is the only
place that's safe.\\
99 - Look, if I was a single man,\\
100 - what we saw today\\
101 - would be like a reward for a
lifetime of disappointments.\\
102 - But I'm not,\\
103 - so it's just
another disappointment.\\
104 - For you, maybe. I saw them.
I don't care who knows it.\\
105 - You better care,\\
106 - 'cause if Kitty finds out,
I'm taking you down with me.\\
107 - And when I take people down,
they stay down.\\
108 - Just ask North Korea.\\
109 - But I have so many questions.\\
110 - I mean,
I've been flashed before,\\
111 - but it was always followed
with either, "Get out!"\\
112 - Or, "There's
a two-drink minimum."\\
113 - But, "Hi, boys"?\\
114 - It has me reeling.\\
115 - Oh! Maybe she was
coming on to us.\\
116 - She wasn't coming on to us.\\
117 - She was coming on to me.\\
118 - She heard about my war record.\\
119 - I'm a hero.\\
120 - You know why Darth
Vader went to the dark side?\\
121 - He was dating a redhead
who wouldn't put out.\\
122 - So, you are like Darth Vader in
the sense that you're not getting any.\\
123 - But you are not like Darth Vader\\
124 - in the sense that you are weak
and strike fear in no one.\\
125 - Well, this is certainly one
way to spend an afternoon.\\
126 - You know, I never really
got into making models.\\
127 - Guess I was too busy having sex.\\
128 - Hey, I don't have sex,
and I still don't build models.\\
129 - I don't have a single model or a
single girl. My life is an empty hole.\\
130 - Hey, nice job.\\
131 - You put the force field
generators on backwards.\\
132 - One photon torpedo
and you're space toast.\\
133 - Okay, Eric, that's it.\\
134 - I think we should have sex.\\
135 - - Yes!
- No!\\
136 - Okay, I'm going
crazy not being with you.\\
137 - You may not be a strong man,
but you read my body like Braille.\\
138 - Burn!\\
139 - Wait. What's "Braille"?\\
140 - You two were awfully quiet
at dinner tonight.\\
141 - Is there anything I
should know about?\\
142 - - No.
- No.\\
143 - - I'll get it.
- Me, too.\\
144 - Hi, boys.\\
145 - Kitty, every time I
come to this house\\
146 - I'm amazed by how much
you've done with so little.\\
147 - Here. We brought Kahlua.\\
148 - Well, aren't you just an angel
sent from after-dinner drink heaven?\\
149 - She wanted to get you cookies, but
I know how much you like the sauce.\\
150 - - Red.
- Toyota!\\
151 - Did you see that
look she just gave us?\\
152 - Was that, "Please don't tell
anyone you saw my boobs"?\\
153 - Or, "Please come over
and see my boobs again"?\\
154 - Do you have to
keep saying that word?\\
155 - Let's just call them..."them."\\
156 - This is the last time we ever talk about
it. From here on out, it never happened.\\
157 - - But, Red...
- Steven, I have been to war.\\
158 - I have seen a lot
of things in my life,\\
159 - and there were only three things\\
160 - that I was gonna keep secret
until the day I die.\\
161 - This is number four.\\
162 - And five.\\
163 - Okay, the tractor beam is
operational. Don't get too close.\\
164 - You really gonna shine
your love light on that?\\
165 - Well, he's a different person
between the sheets.\\
166 - What can I say?\\
167 - Hey, guys.\\
168 - Hey, listen, tomorrow I have this
police test on interrogation techniques.\\
169 - I was wondering if I could
practice on somebody.\\
170 - Jackie, how about you?\\
171 - Well, no.
This is your first time.\\
172 - You're gonna need somebody
much more spineless than me.\\
173 - Try Eric.\\
174 - Yeah, that's good thinking.\\
175 - All right, Mr. Forman,\\
176 - if that is
indeed your real name,\\
177 - what did you do on
the day of yesterday?\\
178 - You'll never get it out
of me, copper. I'm no rat!\\
179 - Kelso, what the hell?\\
180 - Just relax, Eric. I'm just
doing good cop, bad cop.\\
181 - That was the bad cop,
but he's gone now.\\
182 - See, now good cop is here
to take care of you.\\
183 - Hey, how you doing, buddy?\\
184 - It's a real shame about
what happened to your model.\\
185 - Why don't you tell me
what you did yesterday?\\
186 - I came home from the restaurant\\
187 - and spent six hours
building that model!\\
188 - Uh, excuse me.\\
189 - I'm sorry to interrupt,\\
190 - but what about your encounter at the
store with the girl who sells Slurpees?\\
191 - - What?
- What?\\
192 - Yeah, you remember.\\
193 - She asked why you never call
her anymore, and you were like...\\
194 - Ooh!\\
195 - Wait. Is that
the girl from the movies?\\
196 - Donna, I'm asking
the questions here.\\
197 - Is that the girl
from the movies?\\
198 - What happened to,
"I barely know her"?\\
199 - What happened to,
"I barely know her"?\\
200 - Why were you calling her, Eric?\\
201 - Why were you calling her, Eric?\\
202 - Kelso, will you shut up?\\
203 - Oh, yeah, it's getting
hot in here, isn't it?\\
204 - Look, Donna,
maybe I kind of know her.\\
205 - Maybe we kind of went out a couple
times when you were dating Kelso's brother.\\
206 - Wait, you got other girls
besides Donna to go out with you?\\
207 - What is this
obsession with the underdog?\\
208 - Wait, so the other day at
the movies you lied to me?\\
209 - Donna,
I am the senior officer here.\\
210 - So the other day at the movies
you lied to me.\\
211 - No, I...\\
212 - You know, I mean,
it was the movies, you know?\\
213 - It's all make-believe.\\
214 - Okay, you know what? Don't
bother coming over tonight.\\
215 - My sexual tension has been
replaced with another familiar emotion,\\
216 - anger at your scrawny ass!\\
217 - - No!
- Yes!\\
218 - Well, good job, Michael.\\
219 - You solved one crime and
prevented an even bigger one,\\
220 - Donna having sex with Eric.\\
221 - You have the right
to remain... Burn!\\
222 - I'm just glad I could
help the truth be told.\\
223 - Yeah, at least someone's
being honest around here.\\
224 - Mitch, what the hell?\\
225 - What? I thought you
came off looking great.\\
226 - Oh, wait. That was me.\\
227 - Everyone, I want to thank you
for making me so welcome.\\
228 - I feel like the only guest at an
inexpensive backwoods hotel.\\
229 - Steven, you're so tense.\\
230 - Of course he's tense, Mom.\\
231 - You're the one who taught me\\
232 - that if your man's not tense
when you walk into the room,\\
233 - that means
you're doing something wrong.\\
234 - Yeah, that's right.
I'm tense because of you.\\
235 - 'Cause you're... too pretty.\\
236 - Aw!\\
237 - Red, I was gonna get you a
thank-you gift for helping with the move,\\
238 - but then I figured, nah.\\
239 - So, thanks.\\
240 - Don't mention it, Bob.\\
241 - Don't mention anything
about that day ever again.\\
242 - Why? It was a pretty good day.\\
243 - Nothing got broken.
Nobody got hurt.\\
244 - You two even got
to see Pam topless.\\
245 - Yeah, first time I saw them
I was speechless, too.\\
246 - All right.\\
247 - I admit that we saw Pam's...\\
248 - them.\\
249 - But it's not like we planned it.\\
250 - Although our timing
couldn't have been better.\\
251 - I think you mean "worse,"
Steven.\\
252 - No, I'm pretty
sure I meant "better."\\
253 - Red, how could you?\\
254 - Kitty, we just opened the
door, and there she was.\\
255 - What was I supposed to do,
rip the eyes out of my head?\\
256 - Don't feel bad, you guys.\\
257 - This isn't the first time
my body has caused a fight.\\
258 - One time I caused a riot on
a topless beach in Venezuela.\\
259 - Imagine what you saw,
only all tanned and oiled.\\
260 - Huh!\\
261 - She told me to.\\
262 - Well, I hate to let the cat
out of the bag and then leave,\\
263 - but looks like that's
exactly what we're gonna do.\\
264 - Enjoy your fight.\\
265 - I can't believe you saw my mother topless
and didn't tell me about it right away.\\
266 - What, so every time
I see another woman's breasts\\
267 - I'm supposed to tell you?\\
268 - Now I know.\\
269 - I am so mad. I can't
even stand to look at you.\\
270 - And yet you do.\\
271 - Because your eyes work.
You see my problem?\\
272 - All right.
All right. We're going.\\
273 - I can't believe Eric lied
to me about that girl.\\
274 - I mean, we're getting married. I
should know everything about him.\\
275 - If I have to know that he wore a
bathing suit in the tub until he was 12...\\
276 - Yeah, tell everybody.\\
277 - I should know who he dated.\\
278 - That's right, just... Just
get it off your chest, Donna.\\
279 - All the rage and the anger
and the clothing.\\
280 - Hey, hey, hey.\\
281 - There's only room for one
creepy pervert in this group,\\
282 - and that's me.\\
283 - Around here, I'm the one
who drools over all the ladies.\\
284 - Well, I don't drool over
all the ladies, just Donna.\\
285 - A specialist, huh?\\
286 - Okay, we'll try it your way.\\
287 - Oh, my God. You don't...\\
288 - You don't think
Eric and that girl...\\
289 - Made sweet emotional love?
Yes, I do.\\
290 - I bought many
a Slurpee from her.\\
291 - And from what I can tell,
she'll do it with anyone.\\
292 - - Did she do it with you?
- No.\\
293 - She has way too much
self-respect for that.\\
294 - I am gonna march right in
that room and tell my mother\\
295 - there are consequences
to her topless actions.\\
296 - And that she needs
to start wearing pantyhose.\\
297 - This isn't Las Vegas.\\
298 - Whoopsy-doosy.\\
299 - So, then she goes, "Hi, boys."\\
300 - I mean, that has to
be a come-on, right?\\
301 - I saw this dirty movie once where
the plumbers knock on the door,\\
302 - and the lady answers
and she says, "Hi, boys."\\
303 - After that it was
all asses and elbows.\\
304 - Okay, look, I'm sorry, Hyde.\\
305 - There's a lot of guys that Pam
would choose before you and Red.\\
306 - All right, it goes me, then Bob,\\
307 - Fez, then you,\\
308 - Red, then me again,\\
309 - then Donna, then Eric.\\
310 - Okay, Eric, there's
something I need to know.\\
311 - Did you or did you not do it
with the Slurpee slut?\\
312 - - What?
- He answered
a question with a question.\\
313 - That means he's guilty.\\
314 - Now let's ditch him
and carry me out of here.\\
315 - Donna, I did not sleep with her.\\
316 - Well, you lied to me about her before,
so why should I believe you now?\\
317 - You don't believe me? Fine.\\
318 - Let me show you what I was
doing while you were with Casey.\\
319 - You're gonna go hide
in your bedroom and cry?\\
320 - Or you gonna try
to write another song again?\\
321 - "Hey, you guys,
what rhymes with pain?"\\
322 - I love that song.\\
323 - Everyday is like rain
when you're in pain.\\
324 - Okay, Donna.\\
325 - This is a box full of models\\
326 - that I made while you
were with Casey Kelso.\\
327 - Look at this, TIE fighters, assault
vehicles and troop transports.\\
328 - All with minor defects in workmanship.
Yeah, he made these, all right.\\
329 - So this is what you did
while we were apart?\\
330 - Oh, my horny nerd boy.\\
331 - Donna, there's a reason
I didn't tell you about her.\\
332 - She wasn't important.\\
333 - The whole time we
broke up, you know...\\
334 - You know I never
stopped loving you.\\
335 - Eric.\\
336 - Hyde, I never
stopped loving you, either.\\
337 - Don't.\\
338 - I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.\\
339 - You guys better be kidding,
or I'm gonna be super pissed.\\
340 - So, can I suggest that\\
341 - we honor the age-old tradition
of making up after a fight,\\
342 - not just spiritually,\\
343 - but physically?\\
344 - How about
a brand-spanking-new tradition\\
345 - where I buy you
a milkshake and a Playboy?\\
346 - Donna, whoa, I'm insulted.\\
347 - I do not need a milkshake.
Let's go.\\
348 - What... So they're back
together and everything's fine?\\
349 - That sucks.\\
350 - See what happens
when you specialize?\\
351 - I can go and make any
number of ladies uncomfortable.\\
352 - What can you do?\\
353 - What do you think he meant by,
"Whoopsy-doosy"?\\
354 - Not here. Toyota!\\
355 - I'm so freaked out, Mrs.
Forman.\\
356 - I'm gonna have to
sleep with the light on.\\
357 - What are you two doing out here?\\
358 - We were just...\\
359 - Uh-oh!
\subsection {Episode 21: 515}
1 - - Hey, guys.
- Mitch!\\
2 - I thought I heard
a matchbox car pull up.\\
3 - Yeah, I'm short, and
you're shaped like a lollipop.\\
4 - I'm not in the mood, Forman.\\
5 - My brother Jack's wedding is
tomorrow, and I don't have a date.\\
6 - Did you try Aly Richards?
She'll go anywhere there's cake.\\
7 - That's how I got
her into my car.\\
8 - But then I ate the cake,
and she left.\\
9 - I'm in a real bind here.\\
10 - I showed up
at the engagement party alone.\\
11 - My family made
so much fun of me.\\
12 - So I said to myself, 'cause,
of course, I was alone,\\
13 - that I would bring someone
sizzling hot with me to the wedding.\\
14 - Hey,
Donna, would you be my date?\\
15 - Mitch, I don't know what to say.\\
16 - Let me help you out. "No!"\\
17 - Donna, if you went with me, I might
finally earn some respect from my family.\\
18 - Let me say this for you
one more time in Spanish.\\
19 - No!\\
20 - I taught him that.\\
21 - Eric,
you know, it seems harmless.\\
22 - No, Donna,
I'm sorry, but I forbid it.\\
23 - Oh!\\
24 - Mitch, I'd love to go.\\
25 - - Donna, what the hell?
- No.\\
26 - I forbid you to ask me
questions about this.\\
27 - But, Donna...\\
28 - Let me tell you one more time in
Spanish...\\
29 - Hey, Donna, thanks so
much for doing this.\\
30 - Sure,
but, you know, just friends.\\
31 - You don't get to touch
any of this juicy stuff.\\
32 - No, don't worry. I'll even ask
another couple to be, like, chaperones.\\
33 - Hey, Jackie,
do you and Hyde want to go?\\
34 - I'm in, but I can't ask Steven.\\
35 - I'm still on probation for tricking
him into a ballroom dancing class.\\
36 - I'll go with you, Jackie, but I
warn you, don't drink too much.\\
37 - I will take advantage.\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - Ah! I can't believe you
finally sprung for cable TV.\\
48 - Wasn't it you who said, "I'd rather
kiss Ho Chi Minh than pay for TV"?\\
49 - Well, your mother and I are
running out of things to talk about,\\
50 - so I thought the extra 20
channels might help fill in the gaps.\\
51 - Wait a second. Cable guy left?
He forgot to hook up the basement.\\
52 - No, he didn't so much forget,\\
53 - as follow my "don't hook up
the basement" instructions.\\
54 - But, Red, for
an extra two bucks a month,\\
55 - your wife and children could
be enjoying full-frontal nudity.\\
56 - But I don't want
you to enjoy anything.\\
57 - I want people your
age out of my house.\\
58 - Hey, I'm only here
'cause you had a heart attack.\\
59 - I only had a heart attack
because you're here.\\
60 - I'm sorry, Michael, but I'm
gonna have to search that bag.\\
61 - Every time you leave my house with a
backpack, I have to buy new hair spray.\\
62 - I didn't take anything.
This is lunch.\\
63 - I planned a whole romantic day
for me and Brooke.\\
64 - So where are you
and Brooke headed?\\
65 - Well, since she's having a baby,\\
66 - I thought I'd take her to a
place that kids and girls like,\\
67 - so I figured I'd start the date
off at an amusement park,\\
68 - and we'd go on a ride
on the Lightning Whip.\\
69 - And then I'm gonna take her
horseback riding up to this overlook,\\
70 - and then we're gonna get cozy
and drink a little bingo-bango.\\
71 - Oh, sweetie, you're so wrong
it makes me want to cry a little.\\
72 - No, look, pregnant women
cannot go on roller coasters,\\
73 - and they definitely can't drink alcohol,
or bad things can happen to the baby.\\
74 - Case in point, Eric.\\
75 - Well, we didn't know
any better back then.\\
76 - I'm teaching a baby-care class
at the hospital.\\
77 - If you brought Brooke, I
think she'd be very impressed.\\
78 - All right. Yeah, sign us up.\\
79 - You know, there was a time
that all I had to do to impress a girl\\
80 - was turn my eyelids inside out.\\
81 - This baby's
changing everything. Oh!\\
82 - Thanks again for
doing this, Donna.\\
83 - Grandpa saw me walk in with
you, and he slipped me a 20.\\
84 - - Here, you should have this.
- See, that kind of
makes me a hooker.\\
85 - Well, hello.\\
86 - Looks like we're
sharing a table here.\\
87 - Here's your drink, here's your
bread, and here's your new lover.\\
88 - You wish.\\
89 - I'm sitting next to a goddess.\\
90 - I know. Didn't my hair
come out great tonight?\\
91 - Not you, shorty.
Her. I need your help.\\
92 - This is so easy, Fez.
She's like me.\\
93 - She's a country club girl,
and we're bitches.\\
94 - We only understand
one thing, money.\\
95 - - How much should I give her?
- No.\\
96 - Fez, act rich.\\
97 - Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen. My name is Eric.\\
98 - Eric, what are you doing here?\\
99 - I changed my work schedule\\
100 - so I could make sure that Mitch keeps
his tiny little doll hands to himself.\\
101 - Eric,
Mitch is not a threat to you.\\
102 - Okay, he's a perfectly harmless guy who
happens to worship the ground I walk on.\\
103 - You know, it's not his
fault that I'm eye candy.\\
104 - Well, relax. Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.\\
105 - Welcome to
the Holiday Hotel ballroom.\\
106 - I'll be your
waiter this evening.\\
107 - But unlike a normal waiter, I
despise and may try to destroy you.\\
108 - Waiter, I'm rich.\\
109 - And as a rich man, I have
much more money than you.\\
110 - Fez, I'm really not in the mood.\\
111 - Hey, sometimes I'm not in
the mood to count all my money,\\
112 - but I do it anyways
because I am a fat cat.\\
113 - Yeah, well, your bow tie
is starting to unclip, fat cat.\\
114 - Unbelievable.\\
115 - They come to this country,
we give them a job...\\
116 - They're just so ungrateful.\\
117 - I'm Christy. And you are?\\
118 - Ferrari.\\
119 - Fez Ferrari.\\
120 - This charity car wash
was a great idea, girls.\\
121 - Let's take our shirts off!\\
122 - Who changed my channel?\\
123 - What the...\\
124 - Steven!\\
125 - What the hell's
the matter with you?\\
126 - Stealing my cable!\\
127 - Red, before you blow your stack, why don't
you take a look at that car wash girl?\\
128 - She is so sudsy.\\
129 - You drilled a hole in my floor.\\
130 - My foot is about to
drill a hole in your ass!\\
131 - But, Red, the car wash girls
have to make $500\\
132 - or their super-freaky love nest is
gonna be turned into a bookstore.\\
133 - Look, there's only one
clicker, and that's upstairs.\\
134 - My cable, my channel.\\
135 - Stop spraying me, silly,\\
136 - or I'm gonna have to come over
there and kiss you.\\
137 - Tasha, you want a kiss, too?\\
138 - Wow, Tasha,
you have the biggest...\\
139 - ...thunderstorms, which will result\\
140 - in a small-craft advisory...\\
141 - No, no!\\
142 - Man, look at all these preggos.\\
143 - God, that one's walking
like a gigantic duck.\\
144 - She's definitely in her third
trimester. The baby probably dropped.\\
145 - No, I think it's still in there.\\
146 - It means the baby's gotten
itself into the birthing position.\\
147 - Man, you really know stuff.\\
148 - I've read every baby
book in the library.\\
149 - By the way, did you ever read
that book I gave you by Dr. Spock?\\
150 - No, I kind of lost interest when I
realized it wasn't about Star Trek.\\
151 - Well, you signed us up for this
class, and that was very thoughtful.\\
152 - Well, that's me.
I'm Mr. Thoughtful.\\
153 - Man,
how many kids are you having?\\
154 - Oh, hi, Michael.\\
155 - Hope you're ready to talk
boo-boos, burps and binkies.\\
156 - Yeah, Brooke, this is Mrs.
Forman,\\
157 - the lady that told me I shouldn't
take you horseback riding.\\
158 - And, Mrs. Forman, this is Brooke,
the hot librarian I impregnated.\\
159 - Well, I am so
happy you two are here.\\
160 - And you should be happy, because
you have me as your tour guide\\
161 - as you make
the transition to parenthood.\\
162 - Michael.\\
163 - But that could have been
anybody. Everybody knows I rule.\\
164 - Okay, all right, okay.
Let's get started.\\
165 - Now, when you first bring
your little bundles of joy home,\\
166 - they will spend almost 20
hours a day sleeping and pooping.\\
167 - Yeah, that's the life, huh?\\
168 - Now who can tell me what they will
do with the rest of their cute little time?\\
169 - - Yes, Brooke.
- They'll be eating.\\
170 - Very good.
And what will they be eating?\\
171 - Hey, when you're not looking, I'm
gonna sneak the little guy some popcorn.\\
172 - Michael, babies can't eat
popcorn. They don't even have teeth.\\
173 - My Grandma Bessie
doesn't have any teeth,\\
174 - and trust me, she ain't shy
around a bucket of popcorn.\\
175 - Well, Christy says money's great, but
she wants to get to know the real me,\\
176 - and I really care about her.\\
177 - So what's another
fake good quality\\
178 - I could pretend to have
to trick her into the sack?\\
179 - Okay, okay, well, she's wearing fur,
which means she must love animals,\\
180 - which means she must
like sensitive guys.\\
181 - Sensitive, huh?\\
182 - You're good.\\
183 - Hey, cutie. Where you been?\\
184 - Who the hell do you think
you are, talking to me like that?\\
185 - - I'm sensitive.
- Fez!\\
186 - I guess it's a tradition for the
best man to say a few words.\\
187 - And all I really want to say
is that my brother\\
188 - is not the only one fortunate enough
to find himself in love's warm embrace.\\
189 - So, everybody, I'd like to introduce
you to Donna, my new fiancee.\\
190 - Or, as I like to call her, my big,
red love machine. That's her.\\
191 - Mitch, what the hell
are you doing?\\
192 - Ooh, look at that fireball go.\\
193 - Feisty at the table,
feisty in the bedroom.\\
194 - No. No.\\
195 - She's feisty in my bedroom,
people, my bedroom.\\
196 - Okay, he's just some lying, crazy
lunatic. He's crazy. This guy's crazy.\\
197 - And my congratulations
to the happy couple.\\
198 - This is the best wedding
I have ever been to.\\
199 - Falling barometric
pressure from a cold front out of Canada.\\
200 - Look at all that
hail in Buffalo.\\
201 - How can you watch this?\\
202 - It comforts me to know that there are
people out there more miserable than me,\\
203 - like those people
in Buffalo, and you.\\
204 - You have to sit here?
Why don't you go read a book?\\
205 - Why don't you go read a book?\\
206 - Because I have cable.\\
207 - Very nice.\\
208 - Baby says, "It's tight,
but not too tight,\\
209 - "and I wuv the way you
powdered my wittle bottom."\\
210 - I never thought I'd say this, but
you gotta take it easy on the nads.\\
211 - I know what I'm doing. It's just, it
sounded so much easier in the books.\\
212 - - Okay, there.
- Let's have a look.\\
213 - Uh-oh! Baby says, "That's too loose.
Now I'm gonna wee-wee on Daddy."\\
214 - I just have to
redo the safety pin.\\
215 - - God, why can't I do this?
- Oh, no.\\
216 - Baby says, "Ouch, you
poked me. Now I'm gonna cry."\\
217 - That's it. I give up.\\
218 - "Oh, Mommy, don't leave me.\\
219 - "I don't want to end up
in state-run foster care."\\
220 - You know, you seem normal
around your family,\\
221 - but out in the world,
you're a little nuts.\\
222 - So it turns out I
was right about Mitch.\\
223 - So let's see, that's you, wrong.\\
224 - Me, right.\\
225 - You don't have to rub it in.\\
226 - I think I do, Donna.
So rub-a-dub-dub, I'm right.\\
227 - I am humiliated!\\
228 - The only way I'm gonna get
my pride back is to kick your ass!\\
229 - So I'm
challenging you to a fight.\\
230 - That is,
unless you're too chicken.\\
231 - What is this, third grade?\\
232 - Okay, here's what I just heard.\\
233 - "Third grade."\\
234 - - Okay,
you can stop doing that.
- I can stop doing that...\\
235 - Okay, fine. You know what?
I'll fight you. Fine.\\
236 - Good. Tomorrow, 5:15,
the playground, you be there!\\
237 - - Why not just do it at 5:00?
- I have swimming lessons!\\
238 - Thank you so much
for helping me with Christy.\\
239 - She was telling me what
she did last summer at camp,\\
240 - and I think she
might be a whore.\\
241 - - So if there's
anything I can do for you...
- Actually, Fez, there is.\\
242 - When the bride tosses the
bouquet, I really want to catch it.\\
243 - It's such a sweet
and magical moment,\\
244 - so I need you to knock some
of those fat sluts out of my way.\\
245 - I will make
those Weebles wobble,\\
246 - and they will fall down.\\
247 - Fez Ferrari, you're so rich and sensitive,
I think I might go all the way with you.\\
248 - But only if you get everyone out of
my way so I can catch the bouquet.\\
249 - How many bouquets do they throw?\\
250 - One.\\
251 - Let's see, who do I help?
Old friend, new whore?\\
252 - Old friend, new whore?\\
253 - What am I saying?
Do the right thing, Fez.\\
254 - Okay, I don't know who gave you a
tattoo, but that is not good parenting.\\
255 - Look, Michael,
I don't want to talk about it.\\
256 - I thought I was ready,\\
257 - but today I found out I don't
even know how to use a diaper.\\
258 - We are gonna be covered in poo.\\
259 - Look, I think you're underestimating
us, all right? Especially me.\\
260 - Now, these beautiful hands
aren't just made for foreplay.\\
261 - Check it out.\\
262 - I remember the first time I
baby-sat for my little brother,\\
263 - and he power-dooked
all over himself, right?\\
264 - So I got my mom's salad tongs
and pulled off his pants,\\
265 - and then I grabbed him by the ankles
and took him outside and hosed him off.\\
266 - And voila.\\
267 - Oh, Michael, it's so perfect.\\
268 - See, you got the brains and the maternal
instincts, and I know how to wrap ass.\\
269 - We're gonna do this together,
and we're gonna be fine.\\
270 - "Oh, Daddy,
that's just how I like it."\\
271 - You're really
starting to creep me out.\\
272 - Winds variable
out of the northeast,\\
273 - 20 miles an hour
with gusts to 45.\\
274 - Weather kicks ass.\\
275 - Forman, I'm your bud, so
I'm rooting for you in this fight.\\
276 - But business is business, so
I got 50 bucks on the little guy.\\
277 - Well, I see the chicken
showed up for his beating.\\
278 - How can I be a chicken
if I showed up for the fight?\\
279 - You know, it's funny,
'cause what I just heard was...\\
280 - Chicken...
Fight...\\
281 - Eric, as someone that has been
punched a lot,\\
282 - I have some advice.\\
283 - Do not move to a new country
and try to fit in at high school.\\
284 - Hey, Forman, come back here
so we can go over the rules.\\
285 - Okay, Eric, one last thing.\\
286 - You know when
we're play fighting,\\
287 - and you grab my wrist,
and I go, "Ow! Ow! Ow!"?\\
288 - That doesn't really hurt.\\
289 - Okay? So, don't do that.\\
290 - What? The Forman Death Grip?\\
291 - Man, I was really
counting on that.\\
292 - What are you doing here?
I don't want to fight you.\\
293 - I was just trying to act tough so
I can get my self-respect back.\\
294 - By threatening me?\\
295 - It's okay. It's okay.\\
296 - I've got a way out of this
that'll make us both look good.\\
297 - We'll tell everyone that we
worked it out like gentlemen,\\
298 - - and now we're
the best of friends.
- What? No.\\
299 - Mitch, look, Donna was really
nice to you, and you humiliated her.\\
300 - I can't let you
treat people like that.\\
301 - Today I'm...\\
302 - I'm standing up
for all humanity.\\
303 - Would you do it for a 1968 G.I.Joe Desert
Rat edition with the original mess kit?\\
304 - Please.
I have three of those.\\
305 - - The French version?
- G.I. Jacques.\\
306 - It does exist.\\
307 - We got a deal?\\
308 - Well, I'm afraid there's
not gonna be a fight here.\\
309 - Guys, we worked out our
differences, and basically,\\
310 - he's a really great guy.\\
311 - Donna, he's doing the chicken
thing behind me right now!\\
312 - Yeah. He's really good at it.\\
313 - That's not the only thing
I'm good at, cherry pie.\\
314 - All right, that's it.
You're dead.\\
315 - Start the car, Mom!
Start the car!\\
316 - ...temperatures in the...\\
317 - Ooh, Mr. Handyman,
I'm so glad you're finally here.\\
318 - There are so many things
I need you to nail.\\
319 - Lucky for you
I have a big hammer.\\
320 - Red, you dirty man!\\
321 - Mrs. Forman!\\
322 - What are you watching?\\
323 - - Weather.
- Winds variable...
\subsection {Episode 22: Sparks}
1 - Hey, Donna,\\
2 - now that we have our wedding
rings and you can't back out,\\
3 - I have something
that I want to confess.\\
4 - I want to do the bunny hop
at our wedding.\\
5 - I'm good at it and I don't
get to show it off that often.\\
6 - Okay, but I want to walk into the
reception under an archway of cupcakes.\\
7 - - Ooh! Deal.
- Okay.\\
8 - Don't look!
Turn away!\\
9 - Whoa. What?
Did you get me a present?\\
10 - Is it bongo drums?\\
11 - No. I didn't want you
to see my wedding dress.\\
12 - It's bad luck.\\
13 - Isn't having sex before the
wedding the bad luck thing?\\
14 - Well, that, too.\\
15 - Eric, getting married
is like one big minefield.\\
16 - One false step, and limbs
just flying everywhere.\\
17 - Well, don't worry. I didn't
see your wedding dress, so...\\
18 - So, I think we just saved
ourselves some bad luck.\\
19 - Now let's take that credit
that we've earned\\
20 - and use it to have sex.\\
21 - Come on. We can't lose. It's gonna
be like playing with the house's money.\\
22 - Eric, if we broke our celibacy vow
now, what would it say about us?\\
23 - It would say,
"Yay! We had sex."\\
24 - All right, fine.\\
25 - Can we look at our ring
inscriptions, or is that bad luck, too?\\
26 - Well, no, that I have to look at\\
27 - so I can return it in case
you wrote something stupid.\\
28 - "To Eric, love Donna."\\
29 - Well, it's not stupid.
It's short.\\
30 - It's terse.\\
31 - Quite possibly
even a little rude.\\
32 - "All my friends
know the low rider."\\
33 - Um, I don't get it.\\
34 - Am I the low rider?\\
35 - Wait. What do you mean
all your friends know me?\\
36 - Are you saying I'm a whore?\\
37 - No, no, Donna.\\
38 - Low Rider is the song that was playing
in the car at the end of our first date.\\
39 - Remember, you wore that red dress,
and at the end of the night I kissed you,\\
40 - and I remember thinking,
I just...\\
41 - You know, "I just can't
believe she's with me."\\
42 - Eric, that is the most
romantic thing I've ever heard.\\
43 - Take your pants off.\\
44 - That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.\\
45 - Hanging out\\
46 - Down the street\\
47 - The same old thing\\
48 - We did last week\\
49 - Not a thing to do\\
50 - But talk to you\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
54 - Well, fellows, I convinced Donna\\
55 - to break her celibacy vow,\\
56 - which in laymen's terms
means I'm a layman.\\
57 - Damn, Forman,\\
58 - you got your girlfriend
to have sex with you?\\
59 - What is your secret?\\
60 - Okay, you guys, it's a big deal.\\
61 - Have either of you ever
slept with my girlfriend?\\
62 - No, but I've done it
with Hyde's girlfriend.\\
63 - And I was good.\\
64 - Well, just
what the heck is this?\\
65 - What a great auction.\\
66 - Red had a few beers
and bought a canoe.\\
67 - I bought a canoe.\\
68 - Who would've thought?
Me and Red go out\\
69 - and he's the one
to buy something stupid.\\
70 - I don't know where
I'm gonna put this.\\
71 - Red, why would you buy a canoe?\\
72 - I think the question is,
why haven't I before?\\
73 - But we can't afford this.\\
74 - Sure we can. I used the money
that you gave me yesterday.\\
75 - That was for
Eric's wedding present.\\
76 - Congratulations, Eric.\\
77 - I knew you always
wanted a canoe.\\
78 - Fine, Red.
Since you blew the money,\\
79 - I expect you to come up
with a nice sentimental gift\\
80 - for Eric that
doesn't cost anything.\\
81 - Well, that's what you get
for going out and drinking.\\
82 - Maybe one day you'll learn to
stay at home and drink, like me.\\
83 - Hey, boys. I bought a canoe.\\
84 - Oh, hey, Jackie. I just left my
coat here after Donna and I...\\
85 - Well, I'm sure she already filled
you in on all the juicy details, so...\\
86 - Yeah, heard all about
your little leg cramp.\\
87 - Hey, I can turn
a leg cramp into magic.\\
88 - Eh...\\
89 - She just doesn't get me.\\
90 - Oh, no, Donna's wedding dress.\\
91 - Oh, no.\\
92 - Donna's wedding dress.\\
93 - Bad luck. Bad voodoo.\\
94 - Please, give me a break.\\
95 - Well, boys, thanks to
our time here in the circle,\\
96 - I've come up with
a perfectly rational way\\
97 - to keep Donna from finding out
that I tore her dress.\\
98 - I'm gonna destroy the Earth.\\
99 - Okay, well, first you gotta go
to another planet,\\
100 - and then you gotta build a giant
death ray and aim it at the Earth.\\
101 - That's pretty complicated.\\
102 - I can lend you my
sketches if you want.\\
103 - That's a great plan.\\
104 - It's like so many of our ideas
sound good in the circle,\\
105 - but later on
they just sound stupid.\\
106 - But a death ray, it's awesome!\\
107 - Fez, stop
smelling the dress.\\
108 - Hey, either I do this now, or I do
it at the reception. It's your choice.\\
109 - So, Mrs. Forman told me to
get this thing out of her sight.\\
110 - Now, that could mean
put it in the garage,\\
111 - leave it out for
the garbage man.\\
112 - I like to think it meant,
"Hey, have a free canoe."\\
113 - Man, the three of us with a
canoe, we'll be unstoppable.\\
114 - What should we do with it?\\
115 - Let's see.\\
116 - What could we do with a canoe
that would make people say\\
117 - "Oh, no,
what's wrong with them?"\\
118 - I know what we could do today
that's gonna be really fun.\\
119 - Kelso, the last time you said that,
we had to get your stomach pumped.\\
120 - I'm in.\\
121 - Hey, so, how do you plan
on steering this thing on land?\\
122 - Duh.\\
123 - Kelso, I think you should wear a
helmet just in case anything goes wrong.\\
124 - Fez, I'm riding an open canoe
down a rocky mountainside.\\
125 - What could possibly go wrong?\\
126 - I think I'm with Fez
on this helmet thing.\\
127 - Oh, no,
I'm not falling for that one.\\
128 - - Falling for what?
- The old helmet gag.\\
129 - Kelso, I just want you to protect your
head from being crushed like a berry.\\
130 - Yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?\\
131 - Now, let go of the ropes
and watch me fly!\\
132 - One, two, three.\\
133 - Oh, man!\\
134 - Stupid thing.\\
135 - Oh!\\
136 - Oh, man, that could've been me!\\
137 - Okay. I don't get it.
Who's the low rider?\\
138 - It's me.\\
139 - Then I think
he's calling you a whore.\\
140 - Oh, my God. My dress!\\
141 - Yeah, doesn't look so good
in daylight, does it?\\
142 - No, it's gone.
Did you move it?\\
143 - I didn't touch it.\\
144 - Oh! Eric was here earlier.
Maybe he did something with it.\\
145 - Why are you always blaming
Eric for everything?\\
146 - Oh, well, somebody has to\\
147 - or he'll just go through life thinking
there's nothing wrong with him.\\
148 - I know what I could give Eric
that's sentimental,\\
149 - my old baseball glove.\\
150 - Red, anything related to
sports will only remind Eric\\
151 - of the things
he doesn't do well.\\
152 - Oh, fine. I'll just go down to the
space toy and smart mouth store.\\
153 - Mom.\\
154 - Mom, is Donna here?\\
155 - No.
Why are we whispering?\\
156 - You tore her dress?\\
157 - Yeah, see, that would have
been a really good thing to whisper!\\
158 - All right, well, it doesn't
look too bad. I think I can fix it.\\
159 - - Put it down. I'll get my sewing box.
- Mom, thank you.\\
160 - Not on the shoe polish!\\
161 - What have you done,
you bony bastards?\\
162 - Okay, okay. I think I can
clean it, but we have to act fast.\\
163 - Okay, go, go, go, go.\\
164 - Please tell me that sound was a
rip in the space-time continuum.\\
165 - Okay, I'm gonna need
some club soda,\\
166 - a little lemon juice
and some vodka.\\
167 - - To get the stain out?
- No, to think straight.\\
168 - Eric!\\
169 - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Donna's coming.\\
170 - Have you seen my wedding dress?\\
171 - Whoa. You lost
the wedding dress?\\
172 - What happens when we have
a kid? You gonna lose that, too?\\
173 - Oh, my God. I'll find
it. Don't worry. I'll find it.\\
174 - Okay.\\
175 - What is the matter with you?
You just made her feel terrible.\\
176 - I was nervous. You know I
don't know when to shut up.\\
177 - What the hell is that?\\
178 - You know,
there is gonna be a time\\
179 - when you look back on this,
and you're gonna think it's funny.\\
180 - You're gonna be single, 'cause
Donna will never marry you,\\
181 - but you're gonna
think it's funny.\\
182 - We'll get a running start\\
183 - and then I'll jump in and zoom
down the hill like the bobsledders do.\\
184 - And then, because this is a canoe on dirt
and gravel instead of a bobsled on ice,\\
185 - bad things are
gonna happen to you.\\
186 - This is why I'm a legend, Fez.\\
187 - All right, Kelso, this time
you're wearing a helmet.\\
188 - Thanks, Hyde, but I think
I'm not gonna put on a helmet\\
189 - with a bunch of worms
and stuff crammed inside.\\
190 - It's not a prank.\\
191 - Well, now it's not,
'cause I didn't fall for it.\\
192 - It finally happened. I've
become the boy who cried helmet.\\
193 - Okay, on three. Go!\\
194 - Holy crap! Did you
see me bounce off of that tree?\\
195 - Honey, what is taking so long?\\
196 - I told you to put the dress
in the wash for 20 minutes.\\
197 - Yeah, and now it's in the dryer.\\
198 - Oh, no, please tell me
you just put it in.\\
199 - Okay, okay.
Let's look on the bright side.\\
200 - Maybe grey is a more
honest color for Donna.\\
201 - Hi.\\
202 - Um, Fez, I know how you...\\
203 - How do I say this? Um...\\
204 - I know you sometimes like
to hang out in my closet.\\
205 - Yes, and?\\
206 - Do you know what happened
to my wedding dress?\\
207 - Uh...\\
208 - I have to go to the bathroom.\\
209 - Eric, Donna wants
to know what happened to her dress.\\
210 - Oh, tell her you took it.\\
211 - - She'll kill me.
- She'll kill me more.\\
212 - Fine, fine.\\
213 - But at your wedding,
I want my own dance solo.\\
214 - Yeah, absolutely.
Anything you want.\\
215 - - With my own spotlight.
- Fine.\\
216 - - And a mention
in the programme.
- Fine!\\
217 - Look, but if you don't get
upstairs, there will be no wedding,\\
218 - which means
there will be no dance solo.\\
219 - Oh, there will be a dance solo.\\
220 - I took it.\\
221 - Why?\\
222 - Uh, I forgot to go
to the bathroom.\\
223 - She wants to know why.\\
224 - Because you're a pervert.\\
225 - Hey!\\
226 - No, wait. That's true.\\
227 - I don't even have to lie.\\
228 - Because I'm a pervert.\\
229 - Fez, I'm gonna kick your ass.\\
230 - Eric!\\
231 - Oh, my God.
What happened to my dress?\\
232 - Donna, I can explain.
I destroyed it.\\
233 - Ever think maybe we're getting
too old for this kind of thing?\\
234 - No, you can't control the timing of
when a canoe is gonna come into your life.\\
235 - Oh, Steven, this is a horrible
stunt. You're gonna get hurt.\\
236 - No, no, I'm driving the car.
Kelso will be in the canoe.\\
237 - Oh! Okay, have fun.\\
238 - All right, Kelso, listen. You
gotta wear the helmet, all right?\\
239 - Yeah, protect that face.
That's your money.\\
240 - No, I don't want to.\\
241 - Kelso, you're not pulling out of this
driveway until you put on a helmet.\\
242 - Fine. Everyone's against me.\\
243 - Let the sparks fly!\\
244 - Look at that crazy bastard.\\
245 - He may not be smart, but he has
more fun than all of us combined.\\
246 - Yep, we had a guy like him
in the National Guard.\\
247 - - Yeah, what happened to him?
- Invented the wiffle ball.\\
248 - - Donna, what happened?
- It's ruined.\\
249 - My dress is ruined.\\
250 - What am I gonna do?\\
251 - It's okay, honey. I'll find you
a new dress, a better dress.\\
252 - This is my greatest
achievement ever!\\
253 - Dad, I love this dress.\\
254 - Some random thing off the rack
just won't be the same.\\
255 - - The rope broke!
- Runaway canoe!\\
256 - Yes!\\
257 - Oh, no, Donna,
I think I ripped your dress.\\
258 - Kitty, I think
I've got it this time.\\
259 - For my wedding present for Eric,\\
260 - one of my medals from the war.\\
261 - No.\\
262 - - How about my uniform
from the war?
- No.\\
263 - - My gun from the war?
- No.\\
264 - - My boots from the war?
- No.\\
265 - - My canteen from the war?
- No.\\
266 - It can't be anything you had on or
near you when you killed somebody.\\
267 - How about the ring my dad wore?\\
268 - Oh, that's nice.\\
269 - When he killed people
in World War I.\\
270 - Well, now you're just
trying to make me mad.\\
271 - Yeah, I am.\\
272 - Look, Donna, I'm so sorry
about what happened.\\
273 - Well, what I don't get is after
the second rip and the first stain,\\
274 - why you didn't just
put the dress away.\\
275 - Well, at that point,
it had become personal.\\
276 - It was me against the dress,\\
277 - and, well, I was damned if I
was gonna let the dress win.\\
278 - You know, I knew we shouldn't
have broken our no-sex rule.\\
279 - We completely cursed ourselves.\\
280 - Okay, enough of this
voodoo nonsense.\\
281 - Bad things happen
because I am stupid.\\
282 - You're marrying a stupid
guy, Donna. Good luck with me.\\
283 - Here, sweetie. For you.\\
284 - What's this?\\
285 - Mom's wedding dress?\\
286 - Yeah.\\
287 - Swallowed a little pride and
called to ask her if it would be okay.\\
288 - Yeah, but you guys
haven't talked in, like, a year.\\
289 - It was a little awkward,
especially when I said, "It's Bob."\\
290 - And she said, "Bob who?"\\
291 - I love it.\\
292 - Hey, looks like
we kind of saved the day.\\
293 - - Don't touch me.
- Okay.\\
294 - Thanks, Daddy.\\
295 - Hey, anything for you, pumpkin.\\
296 - Plus, I need the room in
the attic for my stuffed bobcat.\\
297 - What was I thinking?\\
298 - I've got
the perfect gift for Eric.\\
299 - Timeless advice from
all my years of marriage.\\
300 - Well, advice from a father
to a son. That's lovely.\\
301 - That is nice, Dad. What is it?\\
302 - Never come home
drunk with a canoe.\\
303 - That's actually good advice.\\
304 - I figured out how to get
the canoe down the mountain.\\
305 - But I'm gonna need a snow blower\\
306 - and all your butter.
\subsection {Episode 23: My Wife}
1 - j&j&\\
2 - Forman, your bachelor party's
tonight.\\
3 - We're going to a strip club,\\
4 - so don't forget your inhaler.\\
5 - Come on, Hyde. I don't need
a silly bachelor party.\\
6 - Oh, come on, man. Be one
last night of the finest debauchery\\
7 - that Point Place has to offer.\\
8 - Hyde, all I need\\
9 - is my sweetie here

You can go.\\
11 - All right!
I'm gonna see nudies!\\
12 - Oh, Eric, you're not going\\
13 - to one of those
hoochie mama shows, are you?\\
14 - Don't worry, Mrs. Forman.
I'll return your son\\
15 - in the same slightly girly
condition that he leaves in.\\
16 - So, Donna, you and the gals
getting together for a big shindig?\\
17 - Well, Jackie might be planning...\\
18 - No, wait. She doesn't
do things for other people.\\
19 - Well, let me plan
your bachelorette party.\\
20 - Oh, we went
absolutely bonkers at mine.\\
21 - All my girlfriends\\
22 - came over for a sewing bee,
and then my friend Gloria\\
23 - gave me my first sip
of hard cider.\\
24 - Boy, you girls are crazy.\\
25 - Well, back then, we had some
morals, not like you girls today...\\
26 - Loose, throwing it around town
like the paperboy.\\
27 - j&j&\\
28 - Donna, why am I blindfolded?\\
29 - because I have
a big surprise for you.\\
30 - Okay, you ready?\\
31 - Isn't it awesome?\\
32 - We're gonna spray-paint
our names on a trailer?\\
33 - All right!\\
34 - No, I put a deposit on it
so we can live here.\\
35 - Eric, it's gonna be
our very own.\\
36 - Oh, how romantic.
I can just see Donna\\
37 - carrying you over
that threshold.\\
38 - So come on.\\
39 - I know you always dreamed
about having a home of your own.\\
40 - Well, I guess I should
have been more specific.\\
41 - Um, no, no. You know what?
This is nice. It's nice.\\
42 - Donna, this is great!\\
43 - Steven, if you ever
rent me a trailer,\\
44 - I will dump you in a second.\\
45 - Good to know.
I need an exit strategy.\\
46 - See, now if we all
turn this way...\\
47 - There. See?
Room for everybody.\\
48 - See? Now this is the closeness
I've been craving.\\
49 - Whose hand is that?\\
50 - - Mine.
- Mine.\\
51 - Oh, man.
Look at this tiny shower.\\
52 - Donna, I don't think
there's room in there\\
53 - for you to soap your chest
like we like.\\
54 - Donna...\\
55 - ...are you sure you want
to live in Point Place?\\
56 - I always thought
you wanted to leave town.\\
57 - Well, Eric,
that's when I was single.\\
58 - But now that
we're getting married,\\
59 - I want to settle down
and start our lives together.\\
60 - Yeah, but I always thought...\\
61 - - You smell pretty.
- Okay.\\
62 - Look, can we do this in private?\\
63 - Bathroom's free.\\
64 - Um, actually, I was just,
uh, heading there.\\
65 - Excuse me.\\
66 - Pardon me.\\
67 - Excuse me.\\
68 - Let me just get
the, uh, curtain.\\
69 - Okay, I can't do this
with all you listening.\\
70 - Somebody's gonna have to sing.\\
71 - Fez, you sing.\\
72 - I can't do both
at the same time.\\
73 - Please hurry!\\
74 - On the good ship\\
75 - Lollipop\\
76 - It's a sweet trip\\
77 - To the candy shop\\
78 - Where the bonbons play...\\
79 - I had a large soda.\\
80 - On the sunny beach
of Peppermint Bay\\
81 - Hangin' out\\
82 - Down the street\\
83 - The same old thing\\
84 - That you did last week\\
85 - Not a thing to do\\
86 - But talk to you\\
87 - We're all all right\\
88 - We're all all right\\
89 -  Hello, Wisconsin!\\
90 - j&j&\\
91 - So it's ours starting today.\\
92 - I signed the lease for a year.\\
93 - Donna, all you ever talked
about was seeing the world,\\
94 - and my dad's better now.
I mean, we can get out.\\
95 - Well, I don't wanna get out.\\
96 - I just want to focus on doing
this marriage thing right,\\
97 - and I think that means curling
up every night next to you\\
98 - on that dining room table
that doubles as a bed.\\
99 - Well, the good news is,
if you guys do decide to travel,\\
100 - you can always drive your house\\
101 - to any number
of vacation destinations.\\
102 - Yeah, and if you ever want\\
103 - to rearrange your furniture,\\
104 - all you gotta do
is slam on the brakes.\\
105 - Hold everything.\\
106 - I believe that is
the ice cream man.\\
107 - Oh, wait. Look,
he's turning around!\\
108 - - No!
- No, come back! We're not from here!\\
109 - We won't rob you!\\
110 - Oh...\\
111 - I mean, it's pretty here.\\
112 - There's lots of open space.\\
113 - I'm coming in, Tracy! There better
not be anyone in there with ya!\\
114 - Hey, the neighbors
seem really nice.\\
115 - Just tell him you're naked
'cause... I don't know.\\
116 - That's why I'm climbing
out the window.\\
117 - - Casey Kelso?
- Hey! Pinciotti.\\
118 - Casey, I thought you left town
after going out with Donna\\
119 - and then breaking up with her
so she had to settle for Eric.\\
120 - Yeah, well, I found my way back.\\
121 - Hey, For-play.\\
122 - You been working out?\\
123 - Oh, um, well,\\
124 - - yeah, a few days a week.
- Oh, man, I'm just kidding.\\
125 - - Okay.
- Well, it's not funny. He's huge.\\
126 - Things are great.\\
127 - Eric and I are getting married.
I'm on the radio... "Hot Donna."\\
128 - You might've heard
people talking,\\
129 - wishing they could date me,
that kind of stuff.\\
130 - Yeah, I mean, Donna hasn't
thought about you at all,\\
131 - although Eric's mom
still asks about you.\\
132 - Then she kind of giggles
and fans herself.\\
133 - You! You get back here!\\
134 - Hey, little advice...
Never answer the phone\\
135 - when you're with a married lady.\\
136 - j&j&\\
137 - See, Forman? Now at the
bachelor party you can hold a beer\\
138 - even after you've lost
the ability to hold a beer\\
139 - from drinking all the beer.\\
140 - I like it.\\
141 - Kind of makes me wonder
why God didn't just make us\\
142 - this way from the start,
you know?\\
143 - Don't worry, man.\\
144 - Evolution will take care of it.\\
145 - Hey, Steven, I took out all
the $1 bills from your wallet,\\
146 - so now you have nothing
to tip the strippers with.\\
147 - All I have left is this $20?\\
148 - Jeez, I'll never be able
to get change for this.\\
149 - Sorry I'm late, guys.\\
150 - I spent all afternoon
in front of the mirror.\\
151 - Then I realized
it was time to get dressed.\\
152 - Fez, you don't have
to look nice, all right?\\
153 - Strippers like everybody.\\
154 - They're raised that way
on special farms out west.\\
155 - Okay, Eric, I talked to my boss
down at the radio station,\\
156 - and I told him
we were staying in town,\\
157 - and I said that
if he wanted to keep me,\\
158 - he would have to put me
on the air full-time,\\
159 - and he went for it!
"Hot Donna" every day on WFPP.\\
160 - - Oh!
- Oh, Donna, that's amazing. All you had to do is ask?\\
161 - Oh, and I tied my shirt up
in one of those sexy knots.\\
162 - Yeah, Jackie does that.\\
163 - We have never paid
to get into Six Flags.\\
164 - Wait. But, Donna, if you take
this job, how are you gonna...\\
165 - Why are you waving a mug at me?\\
166 - I'm sorry. How are you gonna
find time for college?\\
167 - I don't know.
I'll just stop going.\\
168 - Eric, I'm a deejay.
I already have the kind of job\\
169 - I was going to college to get.\\
170 - Yeah, college sucks anyways.\\
171 - It's all smart people,\\
172 - and none of them
are as pretty as me.\\
173 - Yeah, that's true.\\
174 - Half the people in this room
ought to be in magazines.\\
175 - Only half, though, and the
rest of you know who you are.\\
176 - Eric, we both have jobs.
We have a great place to live.\\
177 - We're gonna have
the perfect life in Point Place.\\
178 - Huh. That's funny. I've never
heard the words "perfect life"\\
179 - and "Point Place" used
in the same sentence...\\
180 - Oh, except when separated
by the phrase\\
181 - "As soon as I get
the hell out of."\\
182 - All right. We gentlemen
have a place to be.\\
183 - So unless you ladies are gonna
finally take your clothes off to music...\\
184 - Last chance?\\
185 - No? Okay.\\
186 - j&j&\\
187 - Wow, Mrs. Forman, you can
really whip up a party in no time.\\
188 - And we have activities.\\
189 - Okay, now watch.\\
190 - You tie the ribbon in a bow,\\
191 - and voil,
decorative bags of almonds.\\
192 - We'll make 300 to pass out
at the wedding.\\
193 - Wait, this is Donna's
bachelorette party?\\
194 - What other manual labor
are we gonna do?\\
195 - Huh, scrub a toilet,
dig a trench, write a book?\\
196 - Well, if we don't do this,
who will?\\
197 - I can't believe you invited me
over and you don't have any dip.\\
198 - Red, we're having
a girl's night out.\\
199 - I need you to bag all the
almonds and tie 'em with a bow.\\
200 - - Why me?
- 'Cause I said so.\\
201 - - I don't want to.
- Well, you have to.\\
202 - Oh, you... you make me crazy.\\
203 - Oh, you... you make me crazy.\\
204 - - Fine.
- Good.\\
205 - Since you're getting married,
I'll teach you how to do that.\\
206 - j&j&\\
207 - To Forman and Donna.\\
208 - - To Forman and Donna.
- To Forman and Donna.\\
209 - - Where is Forman?
- Who cares?!\\
210 - - Who cares?!
- Who cares?!\\
211 - How did I not know
about this place?\\
212 - I spent my whole life trying to
get girls to take their clothes off,\\
213 - and all I needed was $10.\\
214 - You know, I don't understand\\
215 - why chicks don't like guys
to look at strippers.\\
216 - I mean, these women are artists.\\
217 - It's like Leonardo or Da Vinci.\\
218 - - Bravo.
- Bravo. Bravo.\\
219 - Bravo.\\
220 - Forman, where's your beer hand?\\
221 - I chewed off the tape
in the men's room.\\
222 - Wait, that was you
makin' those sounds?\\
223 - Hey, you know,
forget what I said\\
224 - about there being
a mummy in the bathroom.\\
225 - I can't stop thinking
about what Donna's doing.\\
226 - The only reason she's still
in Point Place is 'cause of me.\\
227 - If it weren't for me,
she'd probably be\\
228 - on the other side
of the world by now.\\
229 - Hey, I grew up
on that side of the world,\\
230 - and it's no picnic.\\
231 - Although when you eat
every meal on the ground,\\
232 - I suppose, technically
it is a picnic.\\
233 - Look, all I know is\\
234 - if I let Donna stay
in Point Place,\\
235 - she's gonna miss out
on all those great things\\
236 - she wanted to do,
and it'll be all my fault.\\
237 - Forman, would you quit whining?\\
238 - Donna's gonna marry you.\\
239 - From where I'm sittin',\\
240 - what's on your plate
looks pretty good.\\
241 - You don't cut open the
sausage, Forman. You just eat it.\\
242 - Well, I wish it were
that easy, Hyde,\\
243 - but it's
a complex emotional issue.\\
244 - Hey, Phil Donahue, live nudes.\\
245 - j&j&\\
246 - Oh, well, now this looks like a
good place for a bachelorette party.\\
247 - Yeah, did you see
that neon sign out front?\\
248 - It had a naked man with
an arrow pointing this way.\\
249 - Um, I don't think
that was an arrow.\\
250 -  Welcome
to the Little Boy's Room\\
251 - where every night
is ladies' night...\\
252 - Everybody's pants come off.\\
253 - Well, that's a catchy slogan.\\
254 - These guys have been doing
some hard time,\\
255 - and they're dyin'
to meet some ladies.\\
256 - Well, now he... he looks like
he's been a bad boy!\\
257 - Take it off!
Take it off!\\
258 - Is that how we do this? I'm not
sure how to be naughty in public.\\
259 - Ooh!\\
260 - These guys
are goin' back to jail\\
261 - for assault with a sexy weapon.\\
262 - - Oh, my God, Casey?
- Oh, my God, Casey!\\
263 - It's just, Donna's giving up
everything she ever wanted.\\
264 - I can't help but feel like
I'm holding her back, you know?\\
265 - Okay, just so you know,
I make most my money on tips.\\
266 - I'm sorry.\\
267 - Here, you-y-y...\\
268 - You should probably
just take this.\\
269 - - Thanks.
- Forman,\\
270 - would you quit
depressing the strippers?\\
271 - When you depress the
strippers, they go like this.\\
272 - Yeah, this isn't
some hole in the wall\\
273 - where hopeless losers
blow their money\\
274 - on people who don't care
about their problems.\\
275 - This is a strip joint.\\
276 - Yes, it is, Eric.
You're ruining the romance.\\
277 - You, dance for my money!\\
278 - And the rabbit runs around...\\
279 - ...and then back in the hole.\\
280 - Hey, Red, what do ya think
of my nut bag?\\
281 - Ha ha, Bob.\\
282 - I'm done with this.\\
283 - This is not man's work.
I mean, if Kitty wanted me\\
284 - to shoot the almonds at some
communists, that I could do.\\
285 - Oh, you're a big talker
now that she's gone.\\
286 - I'm not afraid of her,
and I'm not doin' this,\\
287 - and I don't care if it means
I have to sit through\\
288 - another one
of her silent breakfasts.\\
289 - What, she just sits there?\\
290 - I talk, she just ignores me.\\
291 - I had to buy a bottle
of Mrs. Butterworth's\\
292 - just so that someone
would smile at me.\\
293 - You can always call me, Red.\\
294 - I'd rather talk to syrup.\\
295 - - So workin' at a strip club.
- Yeah.\\
296 - I finally found a way
to cash in on my good looks\\
297 - without having
to humiliate myself.\\
298 - No, you're not
humiliating yourself.\\
299 - I mean, you're
not the naked guy.\\
300 - You're the guy who
introduces the naked guy.\\
301 - Yeah. So I'm surprised to see
you're still in town.\\
302 - You know, you'd always talked
about gettin' outta here.\\
303 - I always thought you'd be
someplace more glamorous by now,\\
304 - like Paris or Reno.\\
305 - Well, I've got Eric and my job\\
306 - and a great place to live in\\
307 - and/or pull behind a car.\\
308 - I mean, it's not
what I expected,\\
309 - but it's definitely
the right thing to do.\\
310 - You know,\\
311 - that trailer is tiny,\\
312 - and I need room to roam.\\
313 -  Born free\\
314 - As free as
the something free\\
315 - You know, this town is so small,\\
316 - I don't even know what free is.\\
317 - Yeah. Look, listen,\\
318 - I've been other places,
and it's not that great.\\
319 - I mean, since I came back here,
I've got it made...\\
320 - Free drinks, I can borrow any of
these freaky costumes when I want.\\
321 - Plus, you know,\\
322 - - it's showbiz.
- Yeah.\\
323 - So you're happy here.\\
324 - Yeah, and you will be, too.\\
325 - And don't worry, you know,\\
326 - by the time you have a few kids,\\
327 - you'll probably be livin' in
a much bigger trailer.\\
328 - j&j&\\
329 - j&j&\\
330 - Hi. You home already?\\
331 - I thought those boys
would take your clothes\\
332 - and leave you naked in Indiana.\\
333 - You kids... you just don't
know how to do anything.\\
334 - Listen, Dad,\\
335 - Donna wants to stay in Point
Place after we get married.\\
336 - I... How can that be a good idea?\\
337 - Son, in this relationship,\\
338 - you're gonna have one instinct,\\
339 - and Donna's gonna have another.\\
340 - Always go with hers.\\
341 - If history has
taught us anything,\\
342 - it's that you're always wrong.\\
343 - What about the time that I...\\
344 - Oh, yeah, I got nothin'.\\
345 - You know, being with your mother
has taught me one thing.\\
346 - A man can only rise to the
level of the woman that he's with.\\
347 - Hey, what's up?\\
348 - I saw a naked man's butt.\\
349 - j&j&\\
350 - Donna, happy fifth anniversary!\\
351 - Hey, I want you to
put on your best dress,\\
352 - because there's another
sequel to Star Wars.\\
353 - And Mr. and Mrs. Eric Forman\\
354 - are gonna be first in line.\\
355 - What's goin' on?\\
356 - - I'm leaving you, Eric.
- What?\\
357 - We could see the new
Jane Fonda movie instead.\\
358 - Eric, I'm miserable.\\
359 - How can you let me
settle for this?\\
360 - But you said
this is what you wanted.\\
361 - Well, I was wrong. I guess I
was just trying to make you happy,\\
362 - and I forgot about myself.\\
363 - I mean, I wanted
to see the world,\\
364 - not the inside of a trailer.\\
365 - But, Donna, I love you.\\
366 - I love you, too,
but it's not enough.\\
367 - Good-bye, Eric.\\
368 - - I'm sorry.
- Can you just take that?\\
369 - - Yes, you can just
squeeze through there.
- Thank you.\\
370 - Hey, For-play.\\
371 - Casey?\\
372 - Yeah, your mom said
I could bunk here.\\
373 - But don't worry, bud,
as soon as everybody's asleep,\\
374 - I'm gonna head over
to your sister's room.\\
375 - So beautiful morning, huh?\\
376 - Boy, these waffles look great.
\subsection {Episode 24: Going Mobile}
1 - Guys, I have to tell you
about this dream I had.\\
2 - No. Eric, I can't hear another
one of your lame dreams.\\
3 - "Guys, I dreamt I was purple
and I could fly\\
4 - "and Luke Skywalker
was my lab partner."\\
5 - No. It was about Donna.\\
6 - Okay, it was five
years in the future.\\
7 - Five years in the future?
Hey, did you see Jackie?\\
8 - How's she holding up?
Do I need to get out now?\\
9 - Hyde, in my dream, Donna gave
up her life plans to be with me.\\
10 - And she was so miserable,
she left me.\\
11 - That's it?\\
12 - I took my feet off the table and
turned slightly to the left for that?\\
13 - Look, you guys, what if I
really am holding Donna back\\
14 - and she just
doesn't realize it yet?\\
15 - I feel like I could be ruining
both of our lives.\\
16 - Eric, just relax, okay?\\
17 - It's just a stress dream, 'cause
you're getting married tomorrow.\\
18 - Now I had a dream last night
that's worth telling.\\
19 - Okay, Donna was in
a wet T-shirt contest...\\
20 - No, I can't.
Forget it. It's too dirty.\\
21 - So who's gonna be your best man?\\
22 - Oh, you know what?\\
23 - Why don't you guys just decide
who my best man is?\\
24 - Whoa, you want us to choose?\\
25 - Well, if that's not an invitation
to dress a dog up in a tuxedo,\\
26 - I don't know what is.\\
27 - All right. If anyone should
be the best man, it's me.\\
28 - I'm gonna be a father,
so I really need the money.\\
29 - You don't get paid
to be the best man.\\
30 - You do it for the satisfaction of
nailing the hottest bridesmaid.\\
31 - It's in the Bible.\\
32 - Well, I can't do that,
'cause I'm bringing Brooke.\\
33 - Yeah,
we're getting pretty serious.\\
34 - Girls, man. You get them
pregnant, they get all clingy.\\
35 - Hey! On Earth, green means go!\\
36 - Gosh, I didn't know they let
brain-dead morons drive cars.\\
37 - And I didn't know
they let brain-dead morons\\
38 - into the police academy.\\
39 - Oh, they do!\\
40 - Brooke.\\
41 - Hi, Michael.
This is my mother.\\
42 - Yeah, we met.\\
43 - It didn't go very well.\\
44 - Hanging out\\
45 - Down the street\\
46 - The same old thing\\
47 - We did last week\\
48 - Not a thing to do\\
49 - But talk to you\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
53 - Here she is.\\
54 - Welcome, or as I like to say,
Happy Trailers to you.\\
55 - A trailer. Well,
son, you finally made it.\\
56 - Well, and just look
at all the nature.\\
57 - I mean, right in your front yard,
you have a beautiful apple core.\\
58 - Donna, don't take offense, but a
trailer? I think you could do better.\\
59 - Oh, that's funny. I was just
thinking, so could my dad.\\
60 - Hey, watch it, Donna.
She's wrong, Pammy.\\
61 - I can't do better than you. I've
tried and failed on several occasions.\\
62 - Oh, Bobby.\\
63 - Oh, I think I hear a chicken.
I'll be in the car.\\
64 - I'll go with you.\\
65 - We're in the honeymoon stage
where she doesn't mind if I get handsy.\\
66 - Well,
I think this place is great.\\
67 - You can... You can just... You
can drive your car right up to it\\
68 - and then, then you
have a walk-in closet.\\
69 - And look at our teeny,
tiny bathroom.\\
70 - Eric, can I talk to you
privately in the living room...\\
71 - The dining...\\
72 - The left front quadrant?\\
73 - Son, living here
is a real bad idea.\\
74 - There's no privacy.\\
75 - Where will you hide
if Donna has a chore for you?\\
76 - You'll have to dive
under the trailer.\\
77 - Honey, would you help me
unload some groceries from the car?\\
78 - See what I mean?
I'm cornered, like an animal.\\
79 - Coming, honey.\\
80 - Your life is gonna
be a living hell.\\
81 - So, home, sweet home.\\
82 - Yeah.\\
83 - Hey, Donna... Hey.\\
84 - Don't take this
the wrong way, but...\\
85 - Is this really what we want?\\
86 - What? Of course it is. Why?\\
87 - I don't know. I just... You
know, it's such a big step.\\
88 - And I just really want to make sure
this is what we want, what you want.\\
89 - Eric, the life I want
is with you. I love you.\\
90 - - Yeah, I know, but...
- Wait a minute.\\
91 - This isn't about this place.
This is about me.\\
92 - - No.
- Are you having
doubts about me?\\
93 - Because if you are, tell
me now. Don't wait, like,\\
94 - ten years from now when
we're both too fat to get dates.\\
95 - No, no, no, forget it. I'm happy.
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy.\\
96 - Okay, now you're saying
"happy" way too much.\\
97 - Because I'm very happy. If I
were less happy, I'd say it less.\\
98 - I think that's how
language works, Donna.\\
99 - Okay. I'm gonna go
pump out the toilet.\\
100 - So, Forman nixed
our best man idea.\\
101 - Apparently you wearing
a giant trench coat\\
102 - and standing on my
shoulders isn't classy.\\
103 - Not classy? Did you tell him I'll be
wearing a plastic flower that sprays water?\\
104 - So, let's just do rock, paper, scissors,
see who the best man is, all right?\\
105 - No, no, no, no. I hate
that game. I always lose.\\
106 - 'Cause you always pick rock.\\
107 - That's because
nothing beats rock.\\
108 - Paper beats rock.
Those are the rules.\\
109 - Not buying it.\\
110 - Fine. We'll play a new game.\\
111 - How about\\
112 - cockroach, foot, nuclear bomb?\\
113 - Foot squashes cockroach.\\
114 - Nuclear bomb... Pow!\\
115 - ...blows up foot.\\
116 - And cockroach\\
117 - survives nuclear bomb.\\
118 - Oh, that's great.\\
119 - I'll be nuclear bomb.
Nothing beats nuclear bomb.\\
120 - I just told you,
cockroach beats nuclear bomb.\\
121 - Oh, we'll see about that.\\
122 - Laurie, it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride in a wedding dress.\\
123 - Make sure Eric doesn't come in.\\
124 - What, you want
Laurie to guard the door?\\
125 - She's never kept a man out
of anywhere in her entire life.\\
126 - That is not true.\\
127 - Jackie, watch the door.\\
128 - So, Donna, rehearsal dinner tonight,
wedding tomorrow, you excited?\\
129 - Actually, I'm a little nervous.\\
130 - Oh, that's just cold feet.\\
131 - Yeah, but here's the thing.\\
132 - Whenever anyone's nervous
about marriage,\\
133 - everyone says
it's just cold feet.\\
134 - But half of all
marriages end in divorce.\\
135 - So half of those people getting
married should have cold feet.\\
136 - But by the time they realize
their feet were right, it's too late.\\
137 - Too late!\\
138 - How do I know what to do?\\
139 - There is no answer!\\
140 - I can't breathe.\\
141 - How you feel is totally normal.\\
142 - A lot of the guys that I'm dating
were nervous before their weddings,\\
143 - but now they're
all happily married.\\
144 - You do make a mother proud.\\
145 - Ready? One, two, three.\\
146 - Cockroach beats nuclear bomb.\\
147 - That is 38 wins in a row.\\
148 - I think it's safe to say
that I'm the best man.\\
149 - No, wait a minute. Wait a
minute. I just noticed something.\\
150 - Cockroach always wins.\\
151 - One more time,
for all the marbles.\\
152 - Fine. One, two, three.\\
153 - Foot, I forgot about foot.\\
154 - So foot always wins.\\
155 - One more time.
Winner, best man, period.\\
156 - One, two, three.\\
157 - Bomb! Nuclear bomb beats foot.\\
158 - It's like everything in this
game loses to something else!\\
159 - Yes, it's exactly like that.\\
160 - Wait, except...\\
161 - Aha!\\
162 - I was so blind.\\
163 - Nuclear bomb beats everything.\\
164 - One more time, winner take all.\\
165 - One, two, three.\\
166 - I'm going home.\\
167 - Boy, wish I had a dollar
for every awkward lunch\\
168 - I've had with my mom and a
strange guy that knocked me up.\\
169 - Come on, guys, we have to get past
this. The baby's coming in a month.\\
170 - Oh, and Michael's willing
to wait that long?\\
171 - I'm surprised he doesn't just honk his
horn and try to scare it out in a week.\\
172 - Hey, if I wanted to scare
a baby, I wouldn't honk.\\
173 - I'd wear a mask and
make ghost sounds.\\
174 - You were still rude.\\
175 - I think it's common courtesy\\
176 - to wait 30 seconds at a
green light before honking.\\
177 - Pass the rolls, please.\\
178 - Pass the rolls, please.\\
179 - I will, but I feel
it's common courtesy\\
180 - to wait 30 seconds
before passing the rolls.\\
181 - Hey, I just remembered
there's another room here.\\
182 - So, Michael,
I haven't told Brooke yet,\\
183 - but I'm here to take her home to
Chicago to have the baby and live with me.\\
184 - What?
No, but I'm not in Chicago.\\
185 - That's its major attraction.\\
186 - Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the lake?\\
187 - Jackie, do you think Eric
and I are making a mistake?\\
188 - You are.\\
189 - But Eric's just praying this whole
thing goes through before you notice.\\
190 - No, I'm serious.\\
191 - Up until now, everything in our
relationship has been really great.\\
192 - Our first date, our first kiss.
You know, even getting engaged.\\
193 - But now, in the pit of my
stomach, I feel really sick.\\
194 - Look, come on, Donna, you
and Eric are meant to be together.\\
195 - You're like a fat girl and a
cat. It just works, you know?\\
196 - Oh, come on.\\
197 - All right, look,
I'm gonna go pick up my dress.\\
198 - And I'm gonna try not to look
prettier than you, but I can't promise!\\
199 - Oh, God, I can't do this.\\
200 - Okay, let's get a picture
of the wedding party.\\
201 - Oh, Mom, would you fix
your top? This isn't Playboy.\\
202 - She's fine.
Don't fuss with her.\\
203 - Kitty, correct me if I'm wrong,
but at a wedding rehearsal,\\
204 - isn't it tradition for the bride and
groom to, well, you know, show up?\\
205 - Red, they will show up.
Everything is just fine.\\
206 - Eric better have a good reason
for being late.\\
207 - There's only two acceptable excuses
for tardiness in a Pinciotti household.\\
208 - One, traffic was terrible.\\
209 - Two, I should have left earlier,
but I was doing something.\\
210 - Well, Donna's not here, either. Oh,
maybe her new house ran out of gas.\\
211 - Sorry I'm late.\\
212 - Oh, good! They're here.\\
213 - I told you everything would be
fine. Eric and Donna are here.\\
214 - What? No, Eric's not with me.\\
215 - He's not here?\\
216 - Oh, maybe he's stuck in traffic.\\
217 - What traffic?\\
218 - 90% of this town's population
is in this room.\\
219 - All right, look, you can't
take Brooke to Chicago.\\
220 - We're gonna raise
our baby together here, okay?\\
221 - We had it all figured out.\\
222 - Oh, really?\\
223 - So,
where were you going to live?\\
224 - Are you planning to get married?\\
225 - And who's gonna stay home
with the baby?\\
226 - No...\\
227 - We figured out other stuff.\\
228 - Like she's gonna be the one
that does the breast-feeding.\\
229 - And then, if someone
needs to go bowling, I'll do it.\\
230 - Now, I appreciate your concern, but
I'm gonna do what's best for my kid.\\
231 - Well, then think, Michael.\\
232 - You're going away to the police
academy for the next six months.\\
233 - You don't have the time to
help Brooke raise a baby. I do.\\
234 - And I have a house and a
backyard and an extra bedroom.\\
235 - And I love Brooke more
than anything in the world.\\
236 - How can that not be
what's best for her?\\
237 - So,
how's the big argument going?\\
238 - All right, Brooke...\\
239 - Your mom and I thought that\\
240 - maybe since I'm gonna be
at police academy\\
241 - that you might wanna
have the baby in Chicago.\\
242 - You know, just so you
have your mom there.\\
243 - Just for now.\\
244 - Oh, my God, Michael.
Thank you so much.\\
245 - I'll come visit\\
246 - and it'll be great.\\
247 - What do you know?\\
248 - You're a gentleman.\\
249 - And your daughter's a lady.\\
250 - Well, except for the bathroom
sex that resulted in our child.\\
251 - Kitty,
Eric is over two hours late.\\
252 - Let's go home.\\
253 - He's not late, Mr. Forman.\\
254 - He didn't show up because
he doesn't want to marry me.\\
255 - Hey, you don't know that.\\
256 - Maybe he's just
playing hard to get.\\
257 - I'm gonna make him pay for this.\\
258 - I'm not strong, but I know a lot of
ways to destroy men emotionally.\\
259 - - I can vouch for that.
- Yeah.\\
260 - Okay, okay. Let's just...\\
261 - Let's turn those frowns
upside down. I know!\\
262 - We'll all go back to my house and
enjoy the Mexican fiesta I prepared.\\
263 - I probably won't serve
the tiny wedding cakes,\\
264 - since nobody's getting married.\\
265 - But there are three
kinds of burritos.\\
266 - Donna, in troubled times like
this, I have a friend I like to turn to.\\
267 - Gooseberry Gloss lipstick.\\
268 - Nobody can feel sad
with full, juicy, red lips.\\
269 - Okay, no offense, but I don't
think your lipstick is gonna help me,\\
270 - because I am not
a superficial jerk!\\
271 - Better.\\
272 - How could Eric do this to me?\\
273 - I mean, what kind
of a horrible person\\
274 - skips out on someone
they've known their whole life?\\
275 - I mean, someone
they're supposed to love?\\
276 - Uh-huh. Um...\\
277 - Donna, why is your suitcase
in the backseat?\\
278 - Oh, I was just... I don't know. I
thought... Hey, I showed up, okay!\\
279 - What the hell are we gonna do with
all these bride and groom cookies?\\
280 - Give me the groom.\\
281 - Well? Did you find Eric?\\
282 - No, and the Cruiser's gone.\\
283 - I also noticed that
he took his retainer.\\
284 - So it's probably
gonna be an overnighter.\\
285 - I couldn't find him, either.\\
286 - I followed a trail of candy wrappers
and it just circled back around to me.\\
287 - Donna, I know how
difficult this is for you.\\
288 - Now I've been with a lot of men
in my life. Rich men, poor men.\\
289 - Well, not poor.
Upper middle class.\\
290 - My point is,\\
291 - none of them ever loved me
the way I know Eric loves you.\\
292 - Well, thanks, Pamela, but if Eric
loved me, he'd be here right now.\\
293 - Oh, hey, Kitty.\\
294 - Listen, I think I'm just gonna
take Donna home and call it a night.\\
295 - Oh, don't you dare.\\
296 - We need to act like
everything is normal.\\
297 - Keep the party going.
Keep Donna happy.\\
298 - Didn't you have
a speech to give?\\
299 - Kitty, I don't think
it's still appropriate...\\
300 - Okay, Bob's got a speech.
Everybody, listen to Bob's speech.\\
301 - Speech! Speech!\\
302 - I guess I could change a
few things as I go along.\\
303 - "To the lovely bride
and the handsome... bride.\\
304 - "I know the... one of you will
make... yourself very happy.\\
305 - "Your life will surely be enriched
by all the time you spend with...\\
306 - "alone.\\
307 - "You are truly one soul
becoming one joined...\\
308 - "alone forever.\\
309 - "So I don't look at this
as the day I lose a daughter.\\
310 - "I look at this as
the day I gain...\\
311 - "nobody."\\
312 - Salute.\\
313 - Hello.\\
314 - Yeah, we kinda figured.\\
315 - Uh-huh.\\
316 - Well, do you wanna talk to
her? She's sitting right here.\\
317 - Okay.\\
318 - Wrong number.\\
319 - Hyde, what did he say?\\
320 - - He said he's really sorry.
- He's sorry?\\
321 - He left me the day before our
wedding, and he's sorry? What...\\
322 - What does that mean?\\
323 - It means he's not coming.\\
324 - Not tonight, not to the
wedding. He's gone.\\
325 - Man, I am glad to be here.\\
326 - I have had a rough day.\\
327 - Being around all this love and
happiness oughta cheer me right up.\\
328 - I mean, this is a happy day.
Look at all the love.\\
329 - Wait, hey, where's Eric?\\
330 - I can't believe Forman took
off, man. That's not like him at all.\\
331 - Usually he ruins
things by staying.\\
332 - So, Steven, you know, since
the church is booked already,\\
333 - - you that think maybe we...
- No!\\
334 - Oh, come on!\\
335 - Look, Eric jilts Donna and all you
guys can talk about is yourselves?\\
336 - Well, there are
bigger issues here, people.\\
337 - Donna is single. Whoo-hoo!\\
338 - Wait a minute. I get it now.
Cockroach beats everything.\\
339 - Let's play, and I warn you,
I'm going to be cockroach.
\subsection {Episode 25: The Seeker}
1 - Uh-huh.\\
2 - Red. Red.\\
3 - Cousin Alice wants to know why
Eric and Donna's wedding is off.\\
4 - Well, just tell her
what your son did.\\
5 - Oh, now he's my son,\\
6 - just like when he told us
he wanted to be a jazz dancer.\\
7 - Well, he's our son, Red.\\
8 - No son of mine would humiliate his
family by running off on his fiancee.\\
9 - Alice,\\
10 - the wedding is
off because Eric is\\
11 - gay.\\
12 - You're right.
Everybody knew except him.\\
13 - Eric is a mental midget.\\
14 - And you know what else?
He runs like a girl.\\
15 - Bob, you run like a girl.\\
16 - Only when I'm
scared of something.\\
17 - Honey, I'm sure Eric
has a good explanation.\\
18 - On the several occasions I didn't
show up for one of my weddings,\\
19 - I always called to
say I had appendicitis.\\
20 - Well, Eric's not here,
my little girl's unhappy,\\
21 - and I want to punch somebody.\\
22 - Bob, you don't want to fight.\\
23 - I've known you for a long time,
and I know what you really want\\
24 - is a piece of cake.\\
25 - A piece of cake, Kitty?\\
26 - My daughter is devastated,
and you offer me cake?\\
27 - You just tell me one thing,
is it chocolate?\\
28 - Devil's food. I can have it on
the table in less than a minute.\\
29 - Let's do that, then.\\
30 - Okay, guys,
Donna's on her way over,\\
31 - and she knows we all know why
Eric left, and she wants some answers.\\
32 - Well, I'm not gonna tell her.\\
33 - Give Donna bad
news and she hits.\\
34 - She wasn't on the boys'
JV wrestling team for nothing.\\
35 - Okay, well, I can't do it.\\
36 - The last person a girl wants to hear
bad news from is a woman who has it all.\\
37 - Well, you can count me out. I
won't face a girl when I ditch her.\\
38 - I'm not gonna do it
when somebody else does.\\
39 - Well,
I'm not telling her, either.\\
40 - I don't want my
personal parts damaged.\\
41 - I mean, they're
practically brand-new.\\
42 - Well, in a deadlock such as this,
we're forced to turn to our judicial code,\\
43 - which clearly states that in the
event of bad news being delivered\\
44 - in reference to a canceled
wedding, the foreigner does it.\\
45 - Ah, yes. The Immigration
Conversation Act.\\
46 - Where the hell is Eric
and why did he do this to me?\\
47 - Um... Okay...\\
48 - Eric was afraid getting married
and staying here was a mistake.\\
49 - You know, because you would be
giving up your dream of traveling the world\\
50 - and becoming
a ball-breaking feminist.\\
51 - - Jackie, don't push!
- You don't push, you stupid...\\
52 - Hey, hey. Hey! Knock it
off before Fez gets hurt.\\
53 - Look, I just want to say
that we're all really sorry.\\
54 - How could Eric ditch me the night before
our wedding without saying one word?\\
55 - Look, would it make you feel
better if I told you Eric left a note?\\
56 - - He left a note?
- No.\\
57 - But you should hold
on to that feeling.\\
58 - Hanging out\\
59 - Down the street\\
60 - The same old thing\\
61 - We did last week\\
62 - Not a thing to do\\
63 - But talk to you\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - We're all all right\\
66 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
67 - Eric, what a dink, right?\\
68 - You know, I had to call everybody
and tell them the wedding's off.\\
69 - The only good thing is,\\
70 - there's a rumor going around
that he's gay.\\
71 - Which is nice.\\
72 - Look, man,
I mean, I know you're mad,\\
73 - but, you know, Forman was
trying to do the right thing.\\
74 - He just did it in the wrong way.\\
75 - Yeah, but, Hyde,
I don't care why he did it.\\
76 - I mean,
I can't ever forgive him.\\
77 - When I called my mom,
I just cried and cried.\\
78 - Really?
I can't see you crying.\\
79 - I've seen Forman crying.
He does a lot of,\\
80 - "Shut up!
I'm not crying."\\
81 - I want to be mad.
Don't make me laugh.\\
82 - Oh, my God!
Hyde, are you okay?\\
83 - I'm too old for this crap!\\
84 - Why am I stronger than
all the guys I hang out with?\\
85 - You look dorky.\\
86 - Hyde, I am so sorry.\\
87 - I don't know my own strength.\\
88 - I mean, I guess I'm still all
bulked up from JV wrestling.\\
89 - You know what? This isn't my
fault. This is Eric's fault for taking off.\\
90 - Hey, look at the bright side.\\
91 - Now, I can spy on you
from Eric's empty bedroom\\
92 - instead of climbing up a tree\\
93 - where there's no place
to put my juice box.\\
94 - Man, I can't believe I missed
you falling out of the water tower.\\
95 - So, I'm at home,
and I'm watching Scooby-Doo,\\
96 - and I think to myself,
"You know what?\\
97 - "You should go and hang out
with Hyde and Donna."\\
98 - And then I think, "No,"\\
99 - because maybe Scooby and
Shaggy found a real ghost this time.\\
100 - But it wasn't. It was just
another crazy old guy.\\
101 - Steven, I heard what happened.\\
102 - - And you brought me flowers?
- No, these are for me.\\
103 - My boyfriend fell
off the water tower.\\
104 - So, what, Donna? You're alone
and you want me to be alone, too?\\
105 - Okay, Steven, get on home.
I'll take care of you later.\\
106 - Trade you a kiss for a lollipop.\\
107 - I don't need that baby crap.\\
108 - Look at all this
glorious wedding food.\\
109 - Do you,
Fez, take this pizza roll?\\
110 - I do.\\
111 - You know what part of falling
off the water tower I like?\\
112 - The part right after you fall until
the part where you hit the ground.\\
113 - Yeah, yeah! And then that
part right after you crash\\
114 - - where you're just
kind of vibrating there?
- Oh, yeah.\\
115 - That was cool, too.\\
116 - Yeah, and the second time
you fall, it'll be even better,\\
117 - 'cause you know what to expect.\\
118 - You know, so you can enjoy it,
like, do a flip or something.\\
119 - A flip would be awesome!\\
120 - Man, I'm so glad
you fell off the water tower.\\
121 - Look at this.\\
122 - Eric's gone, and I'm left with the
flying Stupid-Ass-Insky brothers.\\
123 - Mom?\\
124 - - Midge!
- Midge!\\
125 - You sounded so sad on
the phone, I just had to come.\\
126 - We missed you so much.\\
127 - All right. All right.
Donna, quit hogging your mom!\\
128 - I know something very interesting
about someone we know very well.\\
129 - No, no. None of your
supermarket gossip.\\
130 - If half of what you say is true,
everybody in this town would have VD.\\
131 - Well, I was going over Steven's
file when he was at the hospital,\\
132 - and you know his father?\\
133 - I believe I had the pleasure
of him writing me a hot check.\\
134 - Of course,
in his defense, he was drunk.\\
135 - Well, according
to Steven's birth certificate,\\
136 - that's not his father.\\
137 - This is so exciting.\\
138 - Steven has a different father
that he doesn't know about.\\
139 - Maybe a nice father,
maybe a sober father.\\
140 - Well, we don't want him to be
entirely sober.\\
141 - You know how those people are.\\
142 - Mom, I can't tell you how much
it means to me that you're here.\\
143 - Well, there are times when a
mother has to be there for her baby.\\
144 - Like now and I
guess when she's born.\\
145 - You know, Mrs. Pinciotti,
in my younger days,\\
146 - I had quite the crush on you.\\
147 - Even though I knew
nothing could ever happen.\\
148 - But now that I'm older, and
I'm gonna be a father soon,\\
149 - if anything does happen,
we got to keep it quiet.\\
150 - Steven, you're late.
Where... Midge!\\
151 - Hey, what a surprise.\\
152 - I should probably return these
earrings I didn't know were yours.\\
153 - - Midge,
what are you doing here?
- I came to see Donna.\\
154 - Who's the amazon?\\
155 - Oh. This is my, uh, friend.\\
156 - Friend?
I don't think so.\\
157 - Hi, I'm Pam, the best thing
that ever happened to him.\\
158 - I'm Midge, the second-best
thing that ever happened to him.\\
159 - Dad, I invited
her to stay with us.\\
160 - Your mom is staying with us?\\
161 - No, your mom is staying with us.\\
162 - What about my mom?\\
163 - Well, that's not my mom,
that's your mom.\\
164 - I'm confused.
Who am I sleeping with?\\
165 - Steven, we need to talk to you
about something pretty important.\\
166 - Look, whatever you found in
my room was planted there.\\
167 - - No. We...
- What's in your room?\\
168 - - Red, stay focused.
- Yeah, stay focused.\\
169 - All right, Steven, just for the record,
I told her to mind her own business,\\
170 - and then she said, "Fine, you
can make your own dinner."\\
171 - So, here we are.\\
172 - No. No, no, no.\\
173 - Steven, we found out that
the man you think is your father\\
174 - isn't really your father.\\
175 - Your real father's name is William
Barnett, and he lives in Milwaukee.\\
176 - Oh, my God!
Steven, this is so exciting!\\
177 - You have a whole new family, which
is great, because I hate your family.\\
178 - Steven, I know you have a lot
of feelings and emotions,\\
179 - and maybe you want to cry.\\
180 - We won't tell if you cry.\\
181 - I'll tell.\\
182 - Yeah,
I don't like guys that cry.\\
183 - Will you two please?
Steven, are you okay?\\
184 - Well, I don't really know the
guy who's supposed to be my dad,\\
185 - and obviously,
I don't know this new guy,\\
186 - so I don't really care.\\
187 - But, Steven, you have to care.\\
188 - What if your new dad is
something amazing like a doctor\\
189 - or the guy who
owns the Love Boat?\\
190 - That didn't go well.\\
191 - What did you want to happen?\\
192 - Well, I thought he would be
happy to hear about his dad.\\
193 - We'd all go to Milwaukee,
and then his rich, new father\\
194 - would be so thrilled to see
him, he'd buy me a fur coat.\\
195 - Bob, could you pass the syrup?\\
196 - You're gonna give her the syrup?\\
197 - The syrup we
share every morning?\\
198 - The syrup that stands for everything
that we are as a man and a woman?\\
199 - I was gonna,\\
200 - but I won't.\\
201 - I will later.\\
202 - No, I won't.\\
203 - - How's it going?
- Your father's an ass.\\
204 - Something we agree on.\\
205 - It's not going that well.\\
206 - Okay, I find this whole thing
very disturbing.\\
207 - I was left at the altar\\
208 - and all I can think about
is what's my dad doing,\\
209 - who's he doing it with,\\
210 - and if I walk through that
door, am I gonna see it?\\
211 - Well, whatever he's doing,
he's doing with me,\\
212 - and we're doing it everywhere,
so knock.\\
213 - So after we left, Steven
said he didn't want to talk\\
214 - about his new dad in
Milwaukee, and he didn't.\\
215 - And he wasn't not talking
about it to be bitchy like I would.\\
216 - He really didn't
want to talk about it.\\
217 - Well, I don't like the way he just
walked out after we told him the news.\\
218 - Why would he do that?\\
219 - Because he's a man, Kitty.\\
220 - And he knows you want
him to cry, but he won't,\\
221 - because crying is for
babies and Italians.\\
222 - And I think we all just need
to stay out of his business.\\
223 - Steven, you're all dressed up.
Are you gonna propose?\\
224 - No. I...\\
225 - I thought I'd head
out to Milwaukee.\\
226 - - By yourself?
- Yeah, I guess.\\
227 - So, I'll see you
guys later, then.\\
228 - Well, we were just talking
about going to Milwaukee\\
229 - for their famous honey buns.\\
230 - Well, you guys could
come along, I guess.\\
231 - Well, I'm... I'm sure in
the mood for a honey bun.\\
232 - And to see baby go
home to his daddy!\\
233 - So Midge wanted you
to pass the syrup,\\
234 - and Pam wouldn't let you.\\
235 - That's interesting.\\
236 - What do you think it means?\\
237 - I think it means
you got a shot at something\\
238 - only rock stars
and professional athletes get.\\
239 - Free passes to Disneyland?\\
240 - No, Fez,
two ladies at the same time.\\
241 - Screw Disneyland.
That's a much better ride.\\
242 - Think I could
really keep both of them?\\
243 - May I say from experience,
when you're dealing with two ladies,\\
244 - the end won't be pretty,\\
245 - but the ride down is super fun.\\
246 - I don't know what to do, Mom.\\
247 - I mean, I always thought
Eric and I would be together,\\
248 - and he blew it.\\
249 - Maybe you'll work it out.\\
250 - Well,
I don't want to work it out.\\
251 - I want to push his face in the
dirt like we did when we were kids.\\
252 - You know what, I never
should have stopped doing that.\\
253 - Donna, just forgive him.\\
254 - How? Give me one good reason.\\
255 - Honey, I can't give
you a rational reason.\\
256 - There probably isn't one.\\
257 - But if you love him, and you
don't want to be without him,\\
258 - you have to forgive him.\\
259 - I was too hard-headed to
forgive your father and I wish I had.\\
260 - Oh, Midge.\\
261 - - You want to take a walk?
- Sure, I'll drive.\\
262 - Did you see that? Maybe
someone will have a happy ending.\\
263 - And then another beginning and another
ending, because he's got two ladies.\\
264 - Bob Pinciotti, a street kid out of
nowhere, gets a shot at the title.\\
265 - You know what? He's like the
Rocky of bagging two ladies.\\
266 - It's a big day, meeting
your father for the first time.\\
267 - You bet.\\
268 - A big day for my big guy, huh?\\
269 - Mmm-hmm.\\
270 - - So how you doing?
- I'm fine.\\
271 - You doing all right, baby?\\
272 - Just quit. Stop. Stop.\\
273 - Keep it down. This
isn't your parole office.\\
274 - - Mr. Barnett will see you now.
- Okay. Okay. This is it.\\
275 - Jackie, here's the camera.\\
276 - Take a picture of Steven
the minute he sees his father.\\
277 - If he cries and you
miss it, I will hurt you.\\
278 - - Where's Steven?
- He left.\\
279 - Yeah. I saw him go and I
didn't say anything on purpose.\\
280 - All right, let's go. Come on.\\
281 - Kitty!\\
282 - I came all this way.
I want my fur coat.\\
283 - Who's there?
Who's there? Who's there?\\
284 - - Jeez, Donna, stop!
- God.\\
285 - I didn't know that was you.\\
286 - You dirt bag! How could you
do that? You just left me there!\\
287 - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I freaked out, okay?\\
288 - I tried to talk to you about it,\\
289 - but I couldn't, and I...\\
290 - I didn't know what to do.\\
291 - All I knew was that I...\\
292 - Donna, I think we were
about to make a huge mistake.\\
293 - Yeah, I know what you mean.\\
294 - I had a bad feeling, too.\\
295 - But here's the difference,
I stayed!\\
296 - Look, Donna, please.\\
297 - Please forgive me.\\
298 - I don't know.\\
299 - I mean,\\
300 - my mom said I should,\\
301 - but I don't know.\\
302 - Listen to me, I am so sorry.\\
303 - Okay, whatever you want to do,
we'll do, okay?\\
304 - Just tell me what to do.\\
305 - We'll figure it out tomorrow.
Just get in.\\
306 - Really?\\
307 - Won't you let me
walk you home from school?\\
308 - Thanks for coming back.\\
309 - Won't you let me
meet you at the pool?\\
310 - If it's so,
well, let me know\\
311 - I just want to say,\\
312 - that was beautiful.\\
313 - I won't make you\\
314 - What the...\\
315 - Glad you're back.\\
316 - Here's a bill for the wedding
you didn't show up for.\\
317 - $6,000?\\
318 - Mmm-hmm. I added on a grand
for pain and suffering.\\
319 - Thanks, Daddy.\\
320 - Buy yourself
something nice with it.\\
321 - I suggest a new boyfriend.
\section {That '70s Season how Season 07}
\subsection {Episode 01: Time Is on My Side}
1 - What?\\
2 - I'm starting to notice
something about you.\\
3 - You're still here!\\
4 - What your father means is,\\
5 - you haven't seemed like yourself
since you called off the wedding.\\
6 - No. What I mean is,\\
7 - get out!\\
8 - Well, I'm sorry. It's only been a week.
It was kind of traumatic, you know?\\
9 - Last night I only slept,
like, nine hours.\\
10 - Honey, we just... We want
to know what your plans are.\\
11 - I would've waited until next
week to ask you, but apparently,\\
12 - some people agree to things and
then just do whatever they want.\\
13 - I've got some questions,
I want answers.\\
14 - What are you doing
about moving out?\\
15 - I don't know.\\
16 - - About Donna?
- I don't know.\\
17 - Your job?\\
18 - I don't know.\\
19 - Your future?\\
20 - Okay, I am gonna go ahead
and hit you with an\\
21 - "I don't know."\\
22 - Then no food for you.\\
23 - - What?
- Red, he's so skinny.\\
24 - Just take away his car.\\
25 - No. I'm trying to teach
the boy responsibility.\\
26 - I want a plan out of you by
tonight, or no dinner, either.\\
27 - Dad, that's not...
Wait. Mom, what's for dinner?\\
28 - - Fried chicken.
- Oh, come on!\\
29 - Steven.\\
30 - - When are you moving out?
- Soon.\\
31 - - How's your girlfriend?
- Shallow as hell.\\
32 - - Job?
- Dead-end.\\
33 - - Future?
- Bleak.\\
34 - Kitty, feed the boy.\\
35 - Hanging out\\
36 - Down the street\\
37 - The same old thing\\
38 - We did last week\\
39 - Not a thing to do\\
40 - But talk to you\\
41 - We're all all right\\
42 - We're all all right\\
43 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
44 - Oh, Donna, your hair
is gonna look so fabulous.\\
45 - It's weird.
I actually feel different.\\
46 - Well, now that you're
not getting married,\\
47 - you have to re-energize
yourself spiritually.\\
48 - And making superficial changes
is the best way to do that.\\
49 - Hello.\\
50 - Oh, come on. A sweater vest?\\
51 - Jackie, if you don't have anything nice
to say, just don't say anything at all.\\
52 - Well, if I followed that rule,
I'd never speak again.\\
53 - Yeah, that's kind of the idea.\\
54 - Okay. Okay. I'm going.\\
55 - You look like a circus poodle!\\
56 - Hey, so, uh...\\
57 - Look,
I think we need to talk about\\
58 - us, since the\\
59 - matrimonial incident.\\
60 - I mean, we've seen each other,\\
61 - but we haven't really
talked about anything.\\
62 - Yeah, but it's been nice, right?\\
63 - I mean,
I'm sick of talking about us.\\
64 - And I'm not mad,
because you were right.\\
65 - I mean, we were about to make
a huge mistake.\\
66 - I can't live in
a trailer with you.\\
67 - I'd hear you
going to the bathroom.\\
68 - Yes, I had thought about that.\\
69 - I was only going to go in a
bottle after you were asleep, so...\\
70 - See, remember when our relationship
was the most fun thing in our lives?\\
71 - And then we put all
this pressure on it.\\
72 - I wish we could just, you know,
hang out without all that stuff.\\
73 - Holy Mother of God.\\
74 - Do you like it?\\
75 - Are you kidding? Yes.\\
76 - It's good.\\
77 - I think it's, like, a sign
that you're loosening up.\\
78 - Like, maybe now you might
like that thing I try in bed\\
79 - that makes you mad.\\
80 - I won't.\\
81 - I'll still try.\\
82 - See, this is great.\\
83 - Your perviness is
our biggest problem now.\\
84 - - Just like the old days!
- Yes.\\
85 - Exactly.\\
86 - See, we should just hang out.\\
87 - You know, get back in touch
with ourselves.\\
88 - That sounds dirty.
Is it dirty?\\
89 - Really, I'm serious.\\
90 - I have a plan.\\
91 - You have a plan? Perfect. I
need a plan. What's your plan?\\
92 - I'm gonna DJ at
the radio station full-time,\\
93 - and rededicate
myself to feminism.\\
94 - At the radio station?\\
95 - Is that... What?\\
96 - Are you gonna play more Heart?\\
97 - And other stuff.\\
98 - - Maybe some Benatar.
- Wow.\\
99 - Whatever. I'm blonde now.
I can do what I want.\\
100 - Hello.\\
101 - What are you doing
with that sandwich?\\
102 - I thought that we established
that you needed a plan.\\
103 - Oh, I've got a plan.\\
104 - Donna is gonna work full-time
at the radio station,\\
105 - and rededicate
herself to feminism.\\
106 - Feminists.\\
107 - Equal pay's fine,
but put a little lipstick on.\\
108 - Whatever. Anyway, that's the plan.
We came up with it this morning.\\
109 - That's Donna's plan.\\
110 - What's your plan?\\
111 - My plan\\
112 - is to support Donna's plan.\\
113 - Thought you had me there,
didn't you?\\
114 - - Get out!
- Fine.\\
115 - But know this,\\
116 - I will have my fried chicken.\\
117 - How come you're making
so many sandwiches?\\
118 - Bulking up for the winter?\\
119 - No, no, no, no.\\
120 - No, no, no.\\
121 - I didn't mean it like that.\\
122 - No, see, it's like...\\
123 - You're the mama bear,
and I'm the papa bear.\\
124 - We're bears!\\
125 - Fine, we're not bears.\\
126 - I'm sorry.\\
127 - I made so many sandwiches, not
because I am a fat, pre-hibernation bear,\\
128 - but because Bob is coming over for lunch,
and since he is still dating Pam and Midge,\\
129 - like some kind of gigolo,\\
130 - I didn't know how
much food I would need.\\
131 - Hey, everybody.\\
132 - I think you know my date
and former wife, Midge.\\
133 - Bob, they know me.\\
134 - It's me, Midge!\\
135 - So, does this mean
you two are back together?\\
136 - Well, we've been
talking things over\\
137 - and we're pretty close
to working things out.\\
138 - What is going on here?\\
139 - - Pam!
- Back off! He's mine!\\
140 - That is not what you said
to me in bed last night.\\
141 - Well, you should have heard what
he said to me last night in the hot tub.\\
142 - You told me that you got up
to get an ice cream cone.\\
143 - I don't know why you're upset,
I wasn't gone that long.\\
144 - All right! Eric traded in
Donna for a hot blonde!\\
145 - Oh, crap!\\
146 - She looks exactly like Donna!\\
147 - That is Donna, you ding-dong.\\
148 - Only now, she lets Forman
do that thing he's been trying.\\
149 - - Eric!
- Hyde...\\
150 - I said, "Maybe."\\
151 - Your hair is beautiful.
I want to touch it.\\
152 - Hey! I can do this all day.\\
153 - Okay, fine.\\
154 - - What? You don't like it?
- I like my women
like I like my wine.\\
155 - Red and full of alcohol.\\
156 - Whatever. When I was a redhead, at
the bakery, they'd give me a free donut.\\
157 - But as a blonde,\\
158 - apple fritter.\\
159 - So I'm gonna stay
blonde for a while.\\
160 - Now I'm gonna go to the bakery.\\
161 - You're a lucky man, Forman.\\
162 - Not only is Donna not mad,\\
163 - but as a bonus, she's
fixed herself up all whore-y.\\
164 - And I have an announcement.\\
165 - Donna and I have decided we're not
talking about our relationship anymore.\\
166 - Hooray!\\
167 - - Bravo!
- Mazel Tov!\\
168 - Finally, we'll have some time to
talk about things I want to talk about.\\
169 - Number one, cocoa butter.\\
170 - It doesn't taste
like cocoa or butter.\\
171 - It's gonna be so great to be
with Donna without all the talking,\\
172 - and
the decisions and the labels.\\
173 - You know, "Am I your fiance?"
You know, "Am I your boyfriend?"\\
174 - Hey, wait a minute.\\
175 - Are you and Donna
boyfriend and girlfriend, or not?\\
176 - No, I'm saying,
why put labels on it?\\
177 - Are you dating,
or can you see other people?\\
178 - Why are you so interested?\\
179 - He's trying to figure out
if he can nail Donna.\\
180 - Hyde!\\
181 - Let me build up to it! Damn!\\
182 - So, can I?\\
183 - No.\\
184 - Thanks for nothing, Hyde!\\
185 - Eric, you really got it made with
Donna. No responsibilities, no plans.\\
186 - What a great way
to live your life.\\
187 - You know what? That is a
great way to live your life.\\
188 - Okay, you know what, you guys?\\
189 - I figured out what
I'm gonna do this year.\\
190 - You're gonna be the first person
to put on my human firecracker suit.\\
191 - No, I'm talking... Wait.
What is a firecracker suit?\\
192 - Right. So,
it's this suit. The... Wait.\\
193 - You have to agree to wear it
before I tell you.\\
194 - I'm intrigued.
We'll talk more later.\\
195 - You guys, my dad said I had to
have a plan this year, and now I have it.\\
196 - I'm gonna take the year off.\\
197 - Isn't that what Elvis said right
before he died on the toilet?\\
198 - No, you guys, seriously.
Look, rich kids do it, right?\\
199 - After high school,
they take a year off,\\
200 - go to Europe, figure out
what they're gonna do.\\
201 - I'm gonna do exactly that.
Just go nowhere and do nothing.\\
202 - - So you're gonna be a bum?
- In the grandest
European tradition! Yes!\\
203 - Hey, why not?\\
204 - He's young, he's got a free place to
live, a girl that's way too hot for him.\\
205 - Ride the ride, baby.\\
206 - Exactly.\\
207 - You know, this whole marriage
thing has made me think.\\
208 - Why am I in such
a hurry to grow up?\\
209 - You know,
life, it's like a train.\\
210 - It's bearing down on you,
and guess what?\\
211 - It's gonna hit you.\\
212 - So you can either start running
when it's far off in the distance,\\
213 - or you can pull up a chair,
crack open a beer,\\
214 - and just watch it come.\\
215 - I did that once.\\
216 - No, Kelso, not a real train.\\
217 - - A metaphorical one.
- Like a... Like a ghost train?\\
218 - Yes.\\
219 - A ghost train.\\
220 - You know, I tell you, Red,\\
221 - I don't like this situation
with Bob and two women.\\
222 - I have put up with a lot of
weird things in this neighborhood.\\
223 - Hot tubs,\\
224 - wife-swapping,\\
225 - jogging...\\
226 - Now I am drawing the line. You
have to make Bob choose one woman.\\
227 - Well, the choice is obvious.
Pam.\\
228 - Red, this isn't your decision,
it's his.\\
229 - And he has to pick Midge.\\
230 - But Pam is so tan.\\
231 - But, Red, if Bob picks Midge,
he will reunite a shattered family,\\
232 - bringing their only daughter a glimpse of
happiness for the first time in her life.\\
233 - But Pam is so tan.\\
234 - Forman?\\
235 - Your whole year-off plan?\\
236 - It's lazy, it's selfish, and it's
gonna piss a lot of people off.\\
237 - So, nice job.\\
238 - - Thank you.
- What are you
gonna do for cash, man?\\
239 - I mean, you know, rich kids,
they have a trust fund.\\
240 - All's you've got is some poorly
assembled model airplanes.\\
241 - I melted those.\\
242 - I guess if I have to work,
it's not a year off, so...\\
243 - Maybe I can sell something.\\
244 - Guys, what do I have
that's worth any money?\\
245 - Oh, Donna! I can sell
your engagement ring!\\
246 - She is going to kill him.\\
247 - Fez, get out of the swing zone.\\
248 - I got ten bucks on the girl.\\
249 - And I mean Donna.\\
250 - Actually, I have no problem
with you selling it.\\
251 - Donna, you are so amazing.\\
252 - I swear, if I had created you in a laboratory,
you could not say more perfect things.\\
253 - Yeah, but then she'd have
those bolts coming out of her neck.\\
254 - Well, the only problem is,
I don't have the ring.\\
255 - What?\\
256 - Well, when I was mad at you
for blowing off the wedding,\\
257 - I threw it off the water tower.\\
258 - Donna, that ring is a symbol of
our eternal love for each other.\\
259 - You were gonna sell it to finance
a year of napping and boozing.\\
260 - Yeah, that's true.\\
261 - So...\\
262 - Who's wrong here?\\
263 - I think there's a little
something wrong with all of us.\\
264 - Okay. Well, if you
threw the ring from up here,\\
265 - I mean, it's gotta be
around here somewhere.\\
266 - All right. Excuse me.\\
267 - I am a police officer in training,
so we're gonna do this by the book.\\
268 - What book?
You didn't read any book.\\
269 - No, but I was assigned one.\\
270 - Killed four bees with it.\\
271 - All right, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna recreate the scene.\\
272 - Donna, Eric has just
let you down in a big way.\\
273 - You're up on this tower.\\
274 - You've had a few beers, so
you're starting to feel a little loose,\\
275 - and very, very vulnerable.\\
276 - - Okay, sounds about right.
- Okay.\\
277 - Do you wanna make out?\\
278 - Kelso, I thought you were
recreating the scene.\\
279 - I'm taking the scene
in a new direction.\\
280 - Okay. Okay, let's just get to
the part where she threw the ring.\\
281 - Okay.\\
282 - So, what we're gonna do here\\
283 - is we're gonna throw an M&M
into the woods in place of the ring.\\
284 - Wherever it lands,
we'll search there first.\\
285 - Fez, give him the M&Ms, man.\\
286 - Yeah, about that...\\
287 - Whose dumb idea it was
to let me hold the M&Ms?\\
288 - All right.
Instead of the candy,\\
289 - we will throw my
keys into the woods.\\
290 - Oh, crap. I just threw
my keys into the woods!\\
291 - Sure did.\\
292 - Why didn't
somebody say something?\\
293 - So that you'd throw your keys
into the woods.\\
294 - Oh, wait. That's a good burn.\\
295 - I had very little to do with it.\\
296 - Okay, Bob, what the hell
are you doing up on your roof?\\
297 - Hiding from my girlfriends.\\
298 - This afternoon, we were all
talking about our favorite juices.\\
299 - Pam said her
favorite juice was cranberry.\\
300 - Midge said she liked apple.\\
301 - To avoid trouble, I said
my favorite was CranApple.\\
302 - They viewed that as cheating,
and now I'm on the roof.\\
303 - Kitty and I think that
you should choose between\\
304 - Pam and Midge.\\
305 - And when I say Kitty and I,
I mean, just Kitty.\\
306 - And when I say choose
between Pam and Midge,\\
307 - I mean, choose Pam.\\
308 - It's tough. I really love Pam.\\
309 - But Midge is Donna's mother.
How can I turn my back on that?\\
310 - Look, just give me a name. I
gotta take something back to Kitty.\\
311 - So don't go home, stay here.\\
312 - I'm not gonna spend the day
hiding on the roof like a damn pigeon.\\
313 - I got beer.\\
314 - Well, it is peaceful up here.\\
315 - All right.
Did anybody find anything?\\
316 - I found a pair of
my sister's panties.\\
317 - I knew they were hers\\
318 - because they had her name
and phone number in them.\\
319 - Girl's gotta advertise.\\
320 - You guys, I'm starving, okay?
I haven't eaten all day.\\
321 - - Here.
- Oh!\\
322 - Oh, thanks, Fez.\\
323 - Yeah, good Cheetos.\\
324 - Really? 'Cause I found them in
the woods, and they were damp.\\
325 - Like something peed on them.\\
326 - Awesome! Eric ate Peetos!\\
327 - Okay, look,
I don't wanna start anything,\\
328 - but had you bought Donna
a decent-sized diamond,\\
329 - we would have found it by now.\\
330 - The ring was pretty small, man.\\
331 - Whenever I saw it, I thought
Donna was really far away.\\
332 - She was standing
right next to me.\\
333 - Yeah, when I first saw it, I said,
"Donna, there's dust on your ring."\\
334 - Then I realized
that was the ring.\\
335 - Guys, guys, stop.\\
336 - You don't find it soon,
a mosquito's going to eat it.\\
337 - Okay, I love the ring.\\
338 - It was petite, not showy.\\
339 - Thank you.\\
340 - Well, you know, Donna
has a thing for miniatures.\\
341 - Okay, you guys,
enough about the ring.\\
342 - Obviously, it was enough
for me to pay for my year off.\\
343 - And according to Esquire,
sweater vests are in.\\
344 - Whoa! Jackie, help!\\
345 - Oh, get away!
You touched Peetos!\\
346 - He touched Peetos!\\
347 - You know what? Falling off
that water tower was a sign.\\
348 - The minute I
stopped working hard,\\
349 - I accomplished exactly
what I needed to do.\\
350 - I found the ring.\\
351 - And, if you're
gonna land on a diamond,\\
352 - it's best to land on
the smallest one ever made.\\
353 - Well, I'm afraid your schoolyard
insults have no power here, child.\\
354 - I'm a whole new me.\\
355 - Tougher, braver and louder.\\
356 - I'm gonna go tell
my dad what's what,\\
357 - and get my
gosh-darn fried chicken.\\
358 - Okay,
Donna, here's the situation.\\
359 - I have to choose
between Pam and Midge,\\
360 - and it's a very personal and
intimate decision that only I can make.\\
361 - It's really scary,
so I'd like you to do it.\\
362 - Dad, I can't choose for you.\\
363 - Come on. You choose my shirts,
choose my lady love.\\
364 - Mom, where are you going?\\
365 - Bob, I saw how hard you
struggled to get on the roof earlier,\\
366 - what with
the kicking and the wiggling.\\
367 - I realized that it was time for me to go
home and give you and Midge a chance.\\
368 - You're one fine lady.\\
369 - Well, I'll miss you, Bob.\\
370 - And, honey,
it's scary to be on my own,\\
371 - but if you come with me,
I know I can do it.\\
372 - Oh, Mom, I would love
to come home with you!\\
373 - Oh, good.\\
374 - You're the only one who
can explain things to the maid!\\
375 - Yeah.\\
376 - Okay.\\
377 - I'm here to earn my dinner.\\
378 - What am I doing about Donna?\\
379 - We're hanging out.\\
380 - What am I doing about my job?\\
381 - I quit.\\
382 - What am I doing about my future?\\
383 - Nothing.\\
384 - When am I moving out?\\
385 - Make me.\\
386 - Hey, Fez, I think I have
something in my eye.\\
387 - Is it Donna's engagement ring?\\
388 - No, no, it's too big for that.\\
389 - Hey, maybe we should
get some doctors' masks,\\
390 - so we don't accidentally
inhale Donna's ring.\\
391 - Okay, okay. Donna, you thought the
engagement ring was big enough, right?\\
392 - Burn!\\
393 - I didn't say anything.\\
394 - So say something.\\
395 - It could've been bigger.\\
396 - Burn!
\subsection {Episode 02: Let's Spend the Night Together}
1 - Hmm, blonde.
More fun.\\
2 - Everything is more fun.\\
3 - Donna, if you only knew what I'd
like to do with you and your new hair,\\
4 - you would beat
the crap out of me.\\
5 - You know, I might just beat
the crap out of you anyway.\\
6 - Yes.\\
7 - So now that Donna's
not Big Red anymore,\\
8 - I guess we have to go back to
what we called her when she was 12.\\
9 - Jugs-a-popping.\\
10 - Man, I hated Jugs-a-popping.\\
11 - Well, you shouldn't have
had popping jugs.\\
12 - Speaking of objectifying women,\\
13 - Jackie, there's a Take Back
the Night rally tonight at the park.\\
14 - Do you wanna go?\\
15 - Oh, and be with your deep-voiced
gal pals? Mmm! No, thank you.\\
16 - This is important.\\
17 - Women should be able to
walk through the park at night\\
18 - without being harassed
by weirdo men.\\
19 - Hey, that was one time!\\
20 - I'll go.
Really?\\
21 - You'd be, like,
the only guy there.\\
22 - Although, there is some
question about Shirley.\\
23 - No, it'll be great. Why don't you
come by when Hyde's dad is here?\\
24 - We'll go over there after that.\\
25 - Yeah, it's my Steven's
big night.\\
26 - He finally decided he
wants to meet his real daddy.\\
27 - I kept hearing
this voice telling me,\\
28 - "Meet your father.
Meet your father."\\
29 - I finally said okay,
Jackie shut the hell up.\\
30 - I did, it's a true story.\\
31 - Get off the phone!\\
32 - Okay, any minute now,
Brooke is going into labor.\\
33 - All right? And I gave her the number
of all the places I was gonna be.\\
34 - I cannot miss this call.\\
35 - Looking good there, Big Red.\\
36 - We're going with
Jugs-a-popping again.\\
37 - Oh, that's a good one.\\
38 - And it's as true now as it
was the first day of fifth grade.\\
39 - That was a popping summer.\\
40 - Steven, I am so happy we
finally found your real father.\\
41 - Here. I framed the
blood test results for you.\\
42 - Now, I spoke to him
this morning,\\
43 - and I told him how your
parents abandoned you\\
44 - and we took you in,\\
45 - and it's hard for you
to say it out loud,\\
46 - but that you love me
because I saved your life.\\
47 - Kitty, I'm not sure...\\
48 - He would be dead on the streets.\\
49 - Okay, he's here.\\
50 - Now, Steven, fix your hair.\\
51 - Eric, don't mumble. Red,
don't yell at Eric if he mumbles.\\
52 - Hi, is this the Formans'?\\
53 - You know, I'm sorry, I
told your friend last week,\\
54 - we don't want a subscription
to Ebony magazine.\\
55 - No, no, no, no.
We spoke over the phone.\\
56 - I'm William Barnett.
I'm Steven's father.\\
57 - Oh!\\
58 - I mean, come in, come in.\\
59 - Everybody, I want you
to meet Steven's father.\\
60 - Steven, look.\\
61 - I'm looking.\\
62 - It's good to meet you, Son.\\
63 - I've really been
looking forward to this.\\
64 - I wanted to get you a card, but they
don't have one for our unique situation.\\
65 - So, here.
Happy First Communion.\\
66 - Wow.\\
67 - You came from him?\\
68 - Yeah, I'm not sure
I see the resemblance.\\
69 - What are you talking about?\\
70 - My 'fro,\\
71 - my coolness,
my suspicion of the Man.\\
72 - This explains so much.\\
73 - Hanging out\\
74 - Down the street\\
75 - The same old thing\\
76 - We did last week\\
77 - Not a thing to do\\
78 - But talk to you\\
79 - We're all all right\\
80 - We're all all right\\
81 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
82 - Well, Mr. Barnett, please, sit
anywhere you like on this big day.\\
83 - After all, how often does a kid\\
84 - get to meet his very own father?\\
85 - So far, I'm up to twice.\\
86 - Hey, would you like a drink?\\
87 - Perhaps a cool drink
for our cool visitor?\\
88 - No, thanks, but I think all
of you could use a Scotch.\\
89 - That's crazy,
we're totally relaxed.\\
90 - Hey, you know what show I love?\\
91 - The Jeffersons.\\
92 - "Dy-no-mite."
Right?\\
93 - "Dy-no-mite" is from Good Times.\\
94 - Oh, well, I watch them all.
I mean, I don't discriminate.\\
95 - So father and son.\\
96 - Yep.\\
97 - Well, I...\\
98 - I guess Steven must
have gotten his mother's...\\
99 - Eyes. Eyes.\\
100 - Steven got his
mother's pretty eyes.\\
101 - Right.\\
102 - Or as I like to say,
"Right on."\\
103 - Okay, well, nobody's talking
about the elephant in the room,\\
104 - so I'll do it.\\
105 - You're black.\\
106 - Mom!\\
107 - Okay, please, Mr. Barnett,
we're very open-minded.\\
108 - Oh! Oh, no,
he's right.\\
109 - I, myself, love that
singer Art Garfunkel.\\
110 - Art Garfunkel's white.\\
111 - Really?\\
112 - Well, his name's got
the "funk" in it, so I...\\
113 - Oh, wait, wait, wait.\\
114 - Red, who's that
black person I like?\\
115 - Martin Luther King?
Yes!\\
116 - You know,
I'm beginning to feel like\\
117 - you haven't had a lot of
black people in this house.\\
118 - Well, I mean, it's certainly
not because we didn't want to.\\
119 - Right, right, no, it's just there
haven't been any available.\\
120 - You know, it's Wisconsin.\\
121 - Well, I know
all about Wisconsin.\\
122 - The only place around here
where you'll see\\
123 - white and black together
is on a cow.\\
124 - That's right! Sure!\\
125 - So, William, what
kind of work do you do?\\
126 - I own a chain of record stores.\\
127 - Record stores. That's
cool, huh? Yeah.\\
128 - I was afraid you were
gonna be a cop or something.\\
129 - I don't like cops.\\
130 - I don't like cops, either.\\
131 - Hey, who do you think shot JFK?\\
132 - I don't know, because they
don't want me to know.\\
133 - Check it out, man. I'm
a chip off the old block.\\
134 - Man, I wish Mom
had told me about you.\\
135 - Hey, when was the
last time you saw her?\\
136 - Oh, years ago. We were
dating and she just disappeared.\\
137 - I guess she married the man
you thought was your father\\
138 - and told him that you
were his baby. Yeah.\\
139 - Mom must have been pretty
relieved when I came out white, huh?\\
140 - Hello? Brooke, it's me.
Did you have the baby yet?\\
141 - No? Are you sure?\\
142 - Okay, well, I'm in
the kitchen now, so...\\
143 - No, it's the same number, but I'm
in the kitchen, so when you call...\\
144 - No, you just gotta think,
"Kitchen, kitchen, kitchen."\\
145 - Okay.\\
146 - This is
so exciting. Yeah.\\
147 - You're going to be a father,
and I'm going to be all alone.\\
148 - My clock is ticking.\\
149 - I just don't want to screw
this thing up, you know?\\
150 - When that kid opens his eyes,\\
151 - I want his daddy, who loves him,\\
152 - to be the first thing he sees.\\
153 - Plus, I don't want him
to get switched at birth\\
154 - with one of those babies
that doesn't speak English.\\
155 - Why are you here?\\
156 - This isn't your home.\\
157 - It still wouldn't kill you
to put up some pictures of me.\\
158 - I got it!\\
159 - Hello?\\
160 - Charlie Schmidt!\\
161 - I haven't talked to you
since the war.\\
162 - You know, I wasn't even sure
they pulled you out of the water.\\
163 - If I had known...\\
164 - Never call here again!\\
165 - Kelso... Well, I gotta
keep the line open.\\
166 - I'm gonna kill you and
mount your head on the TV.\\
167 - And if it helps me
get better reception,\\
168 - it'll do more for me than
you have in your whole life.\\
169 - Oh, Fez, Michael, meet
William Barnett, Steven's father.\\
170 - Good to meet you both.\\
171 - Will you look at that?\\
172 - Yeah, I'm half black, man.\\
173 - Kind of puts all the pieces of
the puzzle together, don't it?\\
174 - Hey, I'm having a kid soon. I
wonder if mine's gonna be half black.\\
175 - Is the mother black?\\
176 - No.\\
177 - I have to say,
Mr. Barnett,\\
178 - it's nice to see another
person of color in this town.\\
179 - White people, you know
what I'm talking about?\\
180 - Can't say that I do.\\
181 - Oh, I hear you, brother man.\\
182 - Eric, are you ready to go?\\
183 - I wanna get to
the feminist rally in time\\
184 - for the Hugh Hefner pinata.\\
185 - Ooh! Uh, Mr. Barnett, this
is Donna. Donna, this is...\\
186 - I'm Steven's father.
I'm black, and it's okay.\\
187 - Wow!
Whoa! Donna, please,\\
188 - do not flip out on the man just
because of the color of his skin.\\
189 - I would never do that.
I would never do that.\\
190 - Okay, Donna, let's just go,\\
191 - and maybe in the car
we can have a little talk\\
192 - about how hurtful our
preconceived notions can be.\\
193 - Power.\\
194 - Steven, this is so exciting.\\
195 - I know, I met my dad.\\
196 - And he's rich.\\
197 - Now, instead of waiting for you to get
off your butt and make some money,\\
198 - we can just inherit it.\\
199 - Wait a minute,
you mean inherit it from me?\\
200 - No, no, no, no.\\
201 - All she means is that
you are doing quite well.\\
202 - When I talked to your secretary
and she put me on hold,\\
203 - there was music on the line.\\
204 - Ha! I thought to myself,\\
205 - "Well, this is a man who
can afford a thing or two!"\\
206 - I see, so you knew I had money
before you invited me here?\\
207 - Is that supposed
to mean something?\\
208 - I don't know.\\
209 - Why don't you tell me, Steven?\\
210 - What are you talking about?\\
211 - Well, I mean,
we don't have to play games.\\
212 - I can give you money,
if that's what you're after.\\
213 - That's who you think I am?\\
214 - I'll see you guys later.
Steven...\\
215 - No, you know what?\\
216 - I didn't need anything
from him growing up,\\
217 - and I don't need
anything from him now.\\
218 - You know,
that was very rude of you.\\
219 - And I can't believe I'm saying
this to someone wearing cashmere,\\
220 - but, well, I don't think
we can be friends.\\
221 - How could you
say that to Steven?\\
222 - He doesn't want your money,
I want your money.\\
223 - How could you think that
anybody here needs your money?\\
224 - Look at this place.\\
225 - Glass grapes,\\
226 - pizza rolls, an organ.\\
227 - It's like Carnegie Hall.\\
228 - I stand by what I said. What
else was I supposed to think?\\
229 - You're supposed to look at me\\
230 - and know that
I raised fine young men.\\
231 - Even though one of them
is at a feminist rally.\\
232 - Mr. Barnett,
you are wrong about Steven.\\
233 - He's perfect.\\
234 - I think you should go.\\
235 - I agree.\\
236 - I was gonna pack you
some leftovers,\\
237 - but that ship
has sailed, mister.\\
238 - I hope this doesn't
discourage you\\
239 - from inviting a second
black person into your home.\\
240 - What do we want?
A safe park!\\
241 - And when do we want it?
Now!\\
242 - I can't hear you, ladies!
When do we want it?\\
243 - Now!\\
244 - Take back the night!\\
245 - This feels really good, Donna.\\
246 - You know, I... Women should
be able to walk through this park\\
247 - without being afraid.\\
248 - In fact, someday, I hope\\
249 - that I can walk through
this park without being afraid.\\
250 - It helps to whistle.\\
251 - Well, I'm really
glad you came with me.\\
252 - And I loved seeing how passionate
you got singing I Am Woman.\\
253 - Well, I'm having
a lot of fun, Donna,\\
254 - and I'm sorry,
but you look so hot.\\
255 - Your new blonde hair
shining in the light\\
256 - of the burning effigy
of that molester.\\
257 - Hey, I got an idea.\\
258 - Why don't we go "take back"
the area behind that bench?\\
259 - When do you want it?
Now!\\
260 - Brooke,
did you have the baby yet?\\
261 - Fez?\\
262 - No, this is your baby.\\
263 - And I'm really ugly.\\
264 - Okay, I know this is a prank,\\
265 - 'cause there's no way
my baby would be ugly.\\
266 - Hello?\\
267 - Yes,
is your refrigerator running?\\
268 - Because if it is, you
better go catch it. Burn!\\
269 - Stop calling me!\\
270 - What?\\
271 - Are you mad?\\
272 - No, Fez.\\
273 - Look, you sound mad.\\
274 - Well, I'm fine.\\
275 - You say the words, but I
can tell you don't mean it.\\
276 - Look, just don't
call me anymore!\\
277 - Why do you keep hanging
up on me if you're not mad?\\
278 - I'm waiting to hear from
the mother of my child!\\
279 - So you are mad.\\
280 - Curl up with the phone
so we can talk this over.\\
281 - Fez, I'm hanging up.\\
282 - Fine, just hang up, then.\\
283 - Fine.\\
284 - Are you still there?\\
285 - Yeah, I'm still here.\\
286 - Hey.\\
287 - Hey.\\
288 - Thanks for not hanging up.\\
289 - I'm just so mad at
that William Barnett.\\
290 - I mean, thinking you wanted
something from him.\\
291 - Everyone knows
I'm all you've ever desired.\\
292 - Look, if I was in his place,\\
293 - I probably would have thought
the same thing, you know?\\
294 - It's not a big deal. I just
wanted to meet the guy\\
295 - and find out if he looked like I
imagined my father would look like.\\
296 - By the way, no.\\
297 - Well, who needs
a father, anyway?\\
298 - You know what?
I've been doing just fine\\
299 - since my dad disappeared
into the jungles\\
300 - to bring freedom to
the grateful natives.\\
301 - Jackie, your father is in prison\\
302 - for embezzling
$60,000 from the city.\\
303 - I'm pretty, don't contradict me.\\
304 - Bring it on, ladies.\\
305 - You know what's great?\\
306 - There's,
like, half-a-dozen women\\
307 - on the other side of that hedge\\
308 - who would kill to be
where I am right now.\\
309 - Ow! Ow! You're on my hair.\\
310 - Your beautiful blonde hair?\\
311 - Get off me! Get off!\\
312 - Hey, there's a woman in
trouble. Let's get him, sisters.\\
313 - What? No, no!\\
314 - That's right, you pervert.
No means no.\\
315 - No, ladies, please. I'm...\\
316 - I'm one of you!\\
317 - Let's put these
work boots to use.\\
318 - Run, Eric!
Run like Bruce Jenner!\\
319 - Oh, crap,
he doesn't know sports.\\
320 - Open up,
it's Dr. Baby Doctor.\\
321 - I have your baby
and he wants to talk to you.\\
322 - It's just me.\\
323 - I'm not a doctor,
and I don't have your baby.\\
324 - Burn!\\
325 - That was a good one.\\
326 - Listen, this baby stuff's, like,
really important to me, okay?\\
327 - So I'm trying to
take it seriously.\\
328 - Hey, say no more. My
sensitive friend, I am sorry.\\
329 - No more phone
pranks from now on.\\
330 - Learn to trust your friends.\\
331 - Mr. Sexy's Pizza.\\
332 - Our special today is sex-a-roni.\\
333 - Fez! God!\\
334 - Hello?\\
335 - Brooke!\\
336 - What? Your water broke?\\
337 - What does that mean?\\
338 - Oh, God, that's disgusting.\\
339 - No, why would you tell me that?\\
340 - Oh, jeez!
Okay, okay, I'm on my way.\\
341 - This is it!
I'm having a baby!\\
342 - Go get 'em, buddy!\\
343 - Mr. Sexy's Pizza.\\
344 - Our special today is sex-a-roni.\\
345 - Well, it's like pepperoni,
but sexy.\\
346 - You mean, you want some?\\
347 - We're closed.\\
348 - Hey.
Hey.\\
349 - So I was wondering if
maybe we could try this again.\\
350 - Yeah, I mean, it worked
so well the first time.\\
351 - I'm sorry about that. Thing
is, if I grew up with nothing\\
352 - and found out I
had a dad with money,\\
353 - I would have thought
maybe he owed me something.\\
354 - Well, that's not me.\\
355 - I know. But when we first met,
I thought I saw myself in you.\\
356 - Yeah, I can see that.\\
357 - You and me, it's like
looking in a mirror.\\
358 - So you want to go
get a beer or something?\\
359 - I can get you in some places
you've probably never been to.\\
360 - Oh, like that cool
jazz bar off the highway?\\
361 - No, no, I'm talking about
country clubs, fancy restaurants.\\
362 - I'm rich as hell, man.\\
363 - Everything okay here, Steven?\\
364 - Yeah, everything's fine.\\
365 - I am so glad you're back.\\
366 - I felt horrible letting you
go off without any leftovers.\\
367 - It's nice meeting you, Red.\\
368 - And you're right. You have
raised some fine young men.\\
369 - Yeah, I'm real proud of them.\\
370 - They stole all my clothes.\\
371 - Who?\\
372 - The angry mob of feminists.\\
373 - Man, look at you. They even
shaved off all your body hair.\\
374 - Yes.\\
375 - Yes, they did.\\
376 - So Kelso has a child.\\
377 - I cannot wait to see the smile
on that sweet little face.\\
378 - And I'll bet
the baby's cute, too.\\
379 - It is so cool that
Steven's father is rich.\\
380 - You know, it almost makes up for
my father being locked away in...\\
381 - I mean, native land.\\
382 - Eric, I'm so sorry about
what happened at the rally.\\
383 - It was like watching an antelope\\
384 - get taken down on Wild Kingdom.\\
385 - This is permanent marker, Donna.\\
386 - I don't think
this is coming off!
\subsection {Episode 03: (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction}
1 - Okay, so tell me
about the job hunt.\\
2 - Did my little worker bee
find a happy hive?\\
3 - No, all the jobs had the same
problem, a dumb ass boss.\\
4 - You know, one guy actually thought
that duct tape was called "duck" tape.\\
5 - A security guard
had to pull us apart.\\
6 - Oh, honey,
you'll find something.\\
7 - You worked at that
auto parts plant for so long.\\
8 - Did you try looking
at auto parts stores?\\
9 - Well, I'll be, Kitty.\\
10 - And here I spent all morning
applying to be an astronaut.\\
11 - What the hell is wrong
with your muffler?\\
12 - I didn't notice anything.\\
13 - Maybe I was too busy
enjoying my morning ice cream.\\
14 - That's right,
my morning ice cream.\\
15 - Part of my new "year off"
philosophy, I want a treat, I get a treat.\\
16 - We haven't even had lunch yet.\\
17 - Eric never eats dessert
before a meal.\\
18 - He used to say, "When I finish
my peas, I can eat what I please."\\
19 - I taught him that.\\
20 - I also taught him, "Eat your
asparagus or people will stare at us."\\
21 - It's not true but he was little.\\
22 - Good Lord,
is that bubblegum ice cream?\\
23 - Well, it's not simply
bubblegum ice cream,\\
24 - it's frosty
double-bubble blast-off.\\
25 - Why are you with him?\\
26 - - I find him whimsical.
- So do I.\\
27 - Isn't that nice?
They find me whimsical.\\
28 - Who's got a bad muffler?\\
29 - See? Even Bob knows
when a car sounds off.\\
30 - I never know what you mean
by "even Bob,"\\
31 - but I like to assume
it's a compliment.\\
32 - Have you checked
your muffler lately?\\
33 - I'm gonna be honest
with you, I haven't.\\
34 - But that green, liquid stuff under the
hood seems to be at a really healthy level.\\
35 - Coolant.\\
36 - Donna, I think
I can handle this, okay?\\
37 - You cool it.\\
38 - All right, that's it.\\
39 - We're going to the muffler shop.\\
40 - This whole family is gonna learn
a little lesson in muffler care today.\\
41 - Well, it's not a trip to Europe,
but at least I get out of the house.\\
42 - Wait a second. You're not
just tricking me into the car\\
43 - and really taking me to the
pediatrician for a booster shot, are you?\\
44 - - No.
- Good.\\
45 - 'Cause that only works twice.\\
46 - So, Steven, did you have a good time
when you went out with your new dad?\\
47 - Yeah, it was all right.\\
48 - - Well, have you
called him yet?
- No.\\
49 - I know if I went out with a boy and
he didn't call me after three days,\\
50 - I'd know he wasn't interested.\\
51 - Well, Jackie,
my dad and I aren't dating.\\
52 - We're a father
and an illegitimate son.\\
53 - Great news, I had a baby,
and it's a girl!\\
54 - - Oh, man, fantastic.
- Congratulations, man.\\
55 - See, Michael,
I'm trying to be happy for you\\
56 - but your hair is
making it really hard.\\
57 - What happened?\\
58 - Well, I was waiting for Brooke
to have the baby, right?\\
59 - And I was chewing gum,\\
60 - and then I decided that I wanted
to blow a bubble as big as my head.\\
61 - And then I did,\\
62 - and then you can probably
figure out the rest of the story.\\
63 - - Oh, what's her name?
- Betsy.\\
64 - Fat girl's name.\\
65 - I don't know, I kind of like it.\\
66 - But, of course, I also
like the larger ladies.\\
67 - Well, I had no say.\\
68 - If it was up to me, it would've
been something classy, like Bambi.\\
69 - Man, do you even know
what "classy" means?\\
70 - 'Cause you're always saying
things are classy when they aren't,\\
71 - like your classy carpeted van.\\
72 - The Shagging Wagon?\\
73 - That had a buttload of class.
Check it out.\\
74 - Oh.\\
75 - Wait, Michael,
these are all pictures of you.\\
76 - Yeah, I was the only thing
not covered in slime.\\
77 - Oh, here's one of
Brooke's boobs.\\
78 - Where did that one
of Brooke's boobs go?\\
79 - Ah, here we go.
Here's a picture of the kid.\\
80 - Nice, Kelso,
she's got Brooke's eyes\\
81 - and your fondness
for mooning the camera.\\
82 - Oh, Michael, she is adorable.\\
83 - Hey, I brought
cigars to celebrate.\\
84 - - Sweet.
- Fun.\\
85 - I love cigars.\\
86 - I hate cigars.\\
87 - This is way worse than what
we usually do in the circle.\\
88 - It tastes disgusting, it smells rank,
it doesn't even make stuff funny.\\
89 - This should be illegal.\\
90 - I hate this.\\
91 - It's like smoking
a dirty sock, only easier.\\
92 - I love cigars.
I'm good at everything.\\
93 - I just threw up a little.\\
94 - Hanging out\\
95 - Down the street\\
96 - The same old thing\\
97 - We did last week\\
98 - Not a thing to do\\
99 - But talk to you\\
100 - We're all all right\\
101 - We're all all right\\
102 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
103 - "Out of business"?\\
104 - I can't believe it.
I loved this place.\\
105 - How could this happen?\\
106 - Red, it's not
your ancestral home.\\
107 - Well, what kind of a town
is this anymore,\\
108 - if we don't even
have a muffler shop?\\
109 - A loud one.\\
110 - Okay, cheer up.
Maybe this is good news.\\
111 - Ooh, what if something fun opens
up here next, like a button shop.\\
112 - We could come here as a family\\
113 - and just dig and dig through
big drawers of buttons.\\
114 - I think it sounds fun.\\
115 - Okay, you guys, I made a list of all
the things I wanna do on my year off.\\
116 - Check out number five.\\
117 - "Jump into my car through
the window like the Duke boys."\\
118 - No, no, no, no. No, I already did
that. That should be crossed off.\\
119 - Number six.\\
120 - "Vandalize a local business"?\\
121 - Yes, and today I happened to
see an out-of-business muffler shop.\\
122 - Imagine the muffler shop signs\\
123 - with the "L-E-R" scratched off
the word "muffler."\\
124 - Eric, no, that's gross.\\
125 - What's gross? I don't get it.
I want to know what's gross.\\
126 - Replace your old "muffler"
without the "ler."\\
127 - "Replace your old muff..."\\
128 - Oh, I get it.\\
129 - I get it.\\
130 - Okay, you know that I'm
digging the new, whimsical Eric,\\
131 - but don't you think you could find a
prank that isn't highly offensive to women?\\
132 - Donna, you're asking me to
play tennis without a racket here.\\
133 - Okay, what if you took "M-U-F"
off the front of "muffler"\\
134 - so the sign says stuff
about "flers," right?\\
135 - That's French for flowers,\\
136 - and people will be really mad if they
thought it was a French flower shop.\\
137 - Huh?\\
138 - Yeah, that sucks,
yours is funny. Go.\\
139 - I never thought
this could happen,\\
140 - but I've officially
become more attractive.\\
141 - Tonight, I have a date with a chick
who called my single fatherhood\\
142 - the cutest thing
she'd ever heard of.\\
143 - You know, I don't know why\\
144 - more guys don't impregnate
women and then not marry them.\\
145 - Maybe because it's
irresponsible and shortsighted.\\
146 - Okay, I might be irresponsible
but my vision is perfect.\\
147 - "Trade in your used muffler."\\
148 - It's brilliant.\\
149 - He's right. I am delighted
and disgusted at the same time.\\
150 - It's just nice to finally feel
that way when I'm not alone.\\
151 - Hey, let me ask you guys
a question about my dad.\\
152 - Shoot.\\
153 - How often are you supposed to talk
to the man who impregnated your mom\\
154 - before she married the man
you thought was your father?\\
155 - Um, I could check with some folks
in Kentucky and get back to you.\\
156 - I could give you the number of
some first cousins who got married.\\
157 - Thanks, man, I don't really
wanna talk to your parents.\\
158 - Ah, good burn.\\
159 - Okay, ice cream's finished,
bubblegum, I will save you for later.\\
160 - Guys, let's do this.\\
161 - "Winterize your muffler."\\
162 - You know, I almost hope
we get arrested.\\
163 - I really want this on my record.\\
164 - Well, it's clear these baby pictures
are having the desired effect.\\
165 - Oh, and here's another one after
we hosed her off and warmed her up.\\
166 - Oh, she's so cute.
Almost as cute as you.\\
167 - Yeah, she wishes.\\
168 - Oh, my gosh!\\
169 - I had that same blankie
when I was a baby.\\
170 - My daddy use to wrap me in it
after my bath.\\
171 - Your daddy?\\
172 - Oh, my God.\\
173 - You're somebody's daughter?\\
174 - So?\\
175 - So, I'm thinking about how I would feel
if my baby girl was out with a guy like me.\\
176 - And it is not good.
I'm all hands.\\
177 - That's okay,
because I want you to...\\
178 - Dude,
that is not what that is for!\\
179 - Look at you,\\
180 - with your bright eyes
and your rosy cheeks.\\
181 - I think vandalism
really agrees with you.\\
182 - Well, Donna, I think I've
really turned a corner here.\\
183 - I'm tough, I'm gritty...\\
184 - Okay, I've got paint
under my fingernails.\\
185 - I may need to borrow
my mother's manicure set.\\
186 - No, leave it.
It makes you look dangerous.\\
187 - Like you don't even know
what a manicure set is.\\
188 - Donna, you got a little
something on your face, I got it.\\
189 - Kitty, come on in here.\\
190 - Boy, have I got big news.\\
191 - - What's going on?
- We just came from the bank.\\
192 - - You know that muffler shop
that went out of business?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
193 - - I bought it.
- Oh, no!\\
194 - Do the "Oh, no"\\
195 - Oh, no!\\
196 - Do the "Oh, no"\\
197 - Oh, no!\\
198 - Come on, everybody!\\
199 - Do the "Oh, no"\\
200 - Say what?\\
201 - Do the "Oh, no"\\
202 - Right now\\
203 - What the hell?\\
204 - Yeah.
"What the hell" is right.\\
205 - Who would do such an
irresponsible and ironic thing?\\
206 - Certainly not anyone
I would want to make out with.\\
207 - I mean the opposite of that.\\
208 - Okay, you gotta admit it, this
one's pretty funny.\\
209 - I'm sorry, I love word play.\\
210 - I don't get it.\\
211 - What's so funny about a muff?\\
212 - - Kitty.
- I mean, muffs aren't funny.\\
213 - I have a beautiful gray one
that I have been using for years.\\
214 - For the love of God, please.\\
215 - - Just tell me what's
so funny about my...
- Nothing.\\
216 - - Nothing is funny.
- Exactly.\\
217 - Would you look at this?\\
218 - Bubblegum ice cream?\\
219 - Okay, good start.\\
220 - Now let's fan out
and search for more clues.\\
221 - Then I realized that Kimberly
is some guy's daughter.\\
222 - Yeah, and he probably loves
her as much as I love my daughter.\\
223 - And then I had to go
and take a boiling hot shower\\
224 - and scrub until
a little skin came off.\\
225 - So the joy of having a daughter
has come with some tragedy.\\
226 - You can no longer treat women
like meaningless whores.\\
227 - Sucker.\\
228 - Steven, see,
fathers love their children,\\
229 - just like your new daddy
loves you. So call him.\\
230 - No.\\
231 - Steven,
you never do anything I say.\\
232 - If you were a dog
or someone who worked for me,\\
233 - I'd smack you on the nose
with a newspaper.\\
234 - All right.
You guys, this is serious.\\
235 - I may never be able
to have sex again,\\
236 - now that I realize that women
are more than just sex objects.\\
237 - Hey, is this like the time you
realized you wanted to be a cop,\\
238 - or like the time you realized
that you were a robot?\\
239 - My eyes were red
in all of my pictures.\\
240 - You know, I just don't believe
that you've changed this much.\\
241 - For example, what would you do
if I were to lean way over like this?\\
242 - What are you doing?
Grab it, man.\\
243 - I can't. I respect women now.\\
244 - Listen, what am I gonna do?\\
245 - It's no big deal, man. You
can just never have sex again.\\
246 - With this body?\\
247 - All right. People would riot
in the streets.\\
248 - You know, you could engage
in a meaningful relationship.\\
249 - What... Donna, this is no time
for your feminist mumbo-jumbo.\\
250 - Okay, wait, you guys,
he doesn't wanna change.\\
251 - He wants to feel like
he's respecting women\\
252 - while still acting like
a shallow creep.\\
253 - You know, you've always
gotten me, Jackie.\\
254 - That's it. I need a loophole\\
255 - so I can keep doing what I'm
doing without being a bad father.\\
256 - The father.
The father is the key.\\
257 - Oh, so we kill the father.\\
258 - That's not what I meant.\\
259 - Oh, me either.\\
260 - Of course Steven
should call his dad.\\
261 - I know, but he won't do it,
and I've tried everything.\\
262 - Nagging him,
poking him, smacking him.\\
263 - You know,
my bag of tricks is empty.\\
264 - Well, he needs a father.\\
265 - The day is fast approaching\\
266 - when someone's gonna have to talk
to him about the birds and the bees.\\
267 - Well, actually, Mrs. Forman...\\
268 - Yes, it's fast,
fast approaching.\\
269 - Oh, here he comes.
Okay, please do something.\\
270 - Okay, I'm good at this.\\
271 - Oh, this is Steven's father,
you say?\\
272 - You really wanna talk to him but
he has to call you first, you say?\\
273 - Mrs. Forman?\\
274 - I know you're not really
on the phone with my dad.\\
275 - Oh, you do?\\
276 - Oh, you do?\\
277 - Well, you're right.\\
278 - I thought you said
you were good at this.\\
279 - He is a lot savvier than Eric.\\
280 - Why can't you guys just let me
do things my own way?\\
281 - Because I know meeting
your dad meant a lot to you.\\
282 - And every time
something means a lot to you,\\
283 - you push it away
before it can push you away.\\
284 - And every time something
means a lot to me, I smother it,\\
285 - which is why
we're such a good couple.\\
286 - Fine, I'll call,\\
287 - if you both promise to stop bothering
me about it, let me do it by myself.\\
288 - - Absolutely.
- Anything you want.\\
289 - I wish I had a camera.\\
290 - Can I just get a picture
of you holding the phone?\\
291 - - I'm hanging up.
- We're going.\\
292 - Going.\\
293 - Yeah, hi,
William Barnett, please.\\
294 - Hey, man, it's Steven.\\
295 - Tell him you love him.
Daddy! Daddy, he loves you!\\
296 - Hello, sir,
I'm here to pick up Kimberly,\\
297 - and I figure if I'm upfront
with you about my intentions,\\
298 - we can all feel good
about our date.\\
299 - Now, I'm about to do things of a
sexual nature with your daughter,\\
300 - and even though she does
those things with everyone,\\
301 - I have a new respect for the
father-daughter relationship,\\
302 - now that I have a daughter,
out of wedlock.\\
303 - I'm no longer with the mother,
don't worry.\\
304 - So I figure,
with your permission,\\
305 - I can proceed to pleasure her
time and time again.\\
306 - What do you say?\\
307 - Ow!\\
308 - God, I can't believe Red
bought the muffler shop.\\
309 - All right, that's it, new
Eric's out, old Eric's back.\\
310 - I should probably just go upstairs
and think about what I've done.\\
311 - Come on.
You can't turn back now.\\
312 - You're like an explorer
discovering a new you.\\
313 - When Columbus discovered
America instead of the West Indies,\\
314 - did he go to his room?\\
315 - No, he waded into Mexico
and stole all of their gold.\\
316 - Okay, I'm not following.\\
317 - I think it's hot when you do naughty
stuff and I want you to keep doing it.\\
318 - You know what? It is hot.\\
319 - I'm not gonna let
Red bully me out of it.\\
320 - I mean, how often was I hot
before? Almost never, right?\\
321 - But now I am hot
and hot I will stay.\\
322 - Let's celebrate.\\
323 - One of Red's beers?\\
324 - There's a new sheriff
in town, little lady.\\
325 - Well, if it isn't my son,
the vandal.\\
326 - You know, I ought to vandalize
your ass with my foot.\\
327 - Look, I said I was sorry
and I'd fix up the shop.\\
328 - Come on, Dad, aren't we getting
a little old for this whole dance?\\
329 - I mean, here we are shaking
our booties and I mean...\\
330 - Disco's dead.\\
331 - You're not taking
dance classes again, are you?\\
332 - No.\\
333 - I'm saying here's
what's gonna happen,\\
334 - you're gonna accept
my apology, man to man,\\
335 - and then sit down with me and
my girl here and enjoy this beer.\\
336 - No, here's what's gonna happen.\\
337 - You are gonna put down
that beer and go to your room.\\
338 - Or here's what's gonna happen.\\
339 - I am gonna go to my room.\\
340 - But first,\\
341 - I'm gonna chug this beer.\\
342 - Chug it, Eric.\\
343 - Okay, that's really fizzy.\\
344 - But I think I made my point.\\
345 - Now you put some
Saran Wrap on that,\\
346 - and I will finish it later.\\
347 - I will have you know
that my friend Linda\\
348 - just filled me in
on some slang words\\
349 - that some people in
my family find funny.\\
350 - And now I can never feel
comfortable with my muff again.\\
351 - - Mom...
- Don't laugh, mister.\\
352 - When you were a baby, I used to
put you in it when you got out of the tub.\\
353 - Okay, this isn't funny anymore.\\
354 - Stop.
\subsection {Episode 04: Beast of Burden}
1 - So, Eric, your dad's muffler
shop opens tomorrow.\\
2 - That's like
the perfect job for him.\\
3 - I mean, he's been
muffling you for years.\\
4 - Yes, he really hates noise. I think
it's because it reminds him of fun.\\
5 - Hey, at least Red
got a job he likes.\\
6 - I thought I was cool
flipping burgers,\\
7 - then I met the night shift guy
who's been doing it for 30 years.\\
8 - He's got no eyebrows,
and he lives in his own car.\\
9 - I don't wanna be that guy.\\
10 - And you won't be if you follow
the plan I gave you.\\
11 - Okay? We get a job
as a local weather team.\\
12 - Then, go national as
morning talk show hosts,\\
13 - and then,
star in our own Ice Capades.\\
14 - Jackie, I've told you,
I don't capade.\\
15 - - I am quitting my job though.
- Me, too.\\
16 - The Department of Motor Vehicles
is not as glamorous as it sounds.\\
17 - You know what
motor vehicles are?\\
18 - They're cars.\\
19 - Just cars.\\
20 - Fez, you know what you should
do? You should be a cop, like me.\\
21 - You'd go undercover
and catch foreigners.\\
22 - Oh, so it's a crime
to be foreign, huh?\\
23 - No, of course not.\\
24 - It's a crime to do the things
that foreigners do.\\
25 - Well, I, for one, love my job.\\
26 - Wanna know why?\\
27 - I have no job.\\
28 - Yeah, it's one of the benefits
of taking the year off.\\
29 - Speaking of that, how did that
all-day marathon go on the Slip 'n Slide?\\
30 - Pretty good.\\
31 - Except for around hour three
when I got a pretty serious owie.\\
32 - Yeah, when you went in for a
juice, I slipped a rock under there.\\
33 - Anyway, today
I will be chasing butterflies.\\
34 - Tomorrow, I'm gonna break out
the giant bubble wand.\\
35 - What'd you do? Go down the
clearance aisle at the drug store?\\
36 - Yes, I did.\\
37 - You'll all be happy to know you'll
be receiving goody bags containing\\
38 - Fourth of July socks, corn
starch and a calendar from 1972.\\
39 - Okay, I think we're nearly
set up for business.\\
40 - Thanks for helping, or standing
around saying, "Ew, grease."\\
41 - Oh, Steven, you already
got that muffler together?\\
42 - Yeah, well, you know, metal
shop was my favorite class.\\
43 - I went to, like, half of them.\\
44 - You know, I need an extra
set of hands around here.\\
45 - How'd you like the job?\\
46 - No, Steven, you can't.\\
47 - I mean, don't take this
personally, Mr. Forman,\\
48 - but guys who work in muffler
shops are bottom feeders.\\
49 - Jackie.\\
50 - What? I said, "Don't take this
personally." What else can I do?\\
51 - Jackie, I gotta take this job.
Are you kidding me?\\
52 - I mean, I'm good with
my hands, I don't mind dirt,\\
53 - and I have
a high tolerance for fumes.\\
54 - Fine, if it makes you happy,
then I'm happy.\\
55 - Steven, why is it everything that I
love about you also grosses me out?\\
56 - You're so complicated.\\
57 - Okay, you can start tomorrow.\\
58 - But we're not driving in
together, that's too weird.\\
59 - Cool.\\
60 - All right, I gotta take off. Gonna
go have lunch with my new dad.\\
61 - Oh. Bring a camera
and get a picture.\\
62 - Steven, you don't have
any family pictures.\\
63 - Well, we have some really good
ones of my mom, down at the county jail.\\
64 - One full face, two profiles,
each one dated and numbered.\\
65 - Oh, Steven,
you've had the hardest life.\\
66 - You know, I should probably be more
generous and considerate with you.\\
67 - But I am what I am.\\
68 - Okay, we are going to make
this the prettiest muffler shop ever.\\
69 - Really, all I wanted
was a grand opening sign.\\
70 - And you've got one.\\
71 - In needlepoint.\\
72 - Kitty, that's so tiny.\\
73 - Needlepoint is very hard work.\\
74 - You never appreciate
anything I do.\\
75 - You should have just
married Betty Parker.\\
76 - No, no, what I meant was,
it's so tiny like your waist.\\
77 - Thank you.\\
78 - Eric, you wanna
hand me the manifold?\\
79 - The manifold.\\
80 - Manifold.\\
81 - Man, I folded that.\\
82 - Eric, are you ready
to help me decorate?\\
83 - Yes. Now I was thinking we
could line this counter here\\
84 - with red-white-and-blue bunting.\\
85 - How is it that I raised a son
who knows bunting\\
86 - but not manifold?\\
87 - Well, maybe the problem is
that you were never around.\\
88 - I was always around.\\
89 - Yeah, maybe
that was the problem.\\
90 - Hanging out\\
91 - Down the street\\
92 - The same old thing\\
93 - We did last week\\
94 - Not a thing to do\\
95 - But talk to you\\
96 - We're all all right\\
97 - We're all all right\\
98 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
99 - Never been to a beauty salon.\\
100 - I'm excited to see how
they make people beautiful.\\
101 - Especially that lady over there,
that's gonna take some work.\\
102 - Well, Fez, I don't know how long I'm
gonna be here, so no wandering off.\\
103 - You gave me a hell of a scare
the other day at the mall.\\
104 - Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.\\
105 - I'm just enjoying my time
away from the DMV.\\
106 - All those foreigners.\\
107 - Learn to speak
garbled English, people.\\
108 - Well, the last time I was
here, they were looking for help.\\
109 - And they have no idea
how weird you are.\\
110 - That is an advantage.\\
111 - - What's the job?
- Shampoo boy.\\
112 - Shampoo boy?\\
113 - You mean I will get paid
to touch hair?\\
114 - I used to get in
so much trouble for that.\\
115 - Hey.\\
116 - Don't touch me.\\
117 - What're you doing, man?\\
118 - What am I doing?\\
119 - What are you doing with your
long, beautiful hair, you hippie freak?\\
120 - That's it.\\
121 - It is my destiny
to be a shampoo boy.\\
122 - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is
there a job that pays you to eat pie?\\
123 - No.\\
124 - It is my destiny
to be a shampoo boy.\\
125 - Hey, Mom,
guess what Hyde just told me?\\
126 - If it's tawdry,
I don't wanna hear it.\\
127 - No. Dad offered him a job
at the muffler shop.\\
128 - And did I even get an offer?
No, like I wasn't there, too.\\
129 - Like I was all sore
from hanging all that bunting.\\
130 - Well, sweetie,
don't take it so hard.\\
131 - Your father's always had
a soft spot for Steven.\\
132 - But he loves you, too.
I just know it.\\
133 - Well, you know what I think?\\
134 - If Dad loves Hyde so much,
maybe he should marry him.\\
135 - Honey, that's not possible. Your
father's already married to me.\\
136 - No, Mom, it's an expression.\\
137 - Well, it's not a very good one.\\
138 - 23 skidoo.
Now, that's an expression.\\
139 - Yes.\\
140 - That's what I should have said.\\
141 - Kitty, look. I framed one of
my "Grand Opening" fliers.\\
142 - Now, if the shop's a success,
I'll have a souvenir.\\
143 - And if not, I'll have something
to glare at while I'm drinking.\\
144 - It's a very good idea.\\
145 - And you know what else
is a very good idea?\\
146 - Offering Eric a job,
just like you did Steven.\\
147 - Kitty, I can only afford
to hire one person.\\
148 - And why can't that one person
be your very own son?\\
149 - Because my very own son
can't do anything.\\
150 - Now, that's not true.\\
151 - Just today he caught
the most beautiful butterfly.\\
152 - Well, if a giant butterfly
is tearing up the shop,\\
153 - I'll call Eric.\\
154 - I'm not sure I want him
to face a giant butterfly.\\
155 - So, Red, we got your muffler
store flier, and I'm a little hurt.\\
156 - You know, you never
asked for my input.\\
157 - I mean,
I had a business of my own.\\
158 - Bob, your business went under.\\
159 - Yeah, but very slowly.\\
160 - Well, don't feel insulted, Bob.\\
161 - Red wouldn't even give
his own child a job.\\
162 - If you had a muffler shop,
wouldn't you give Donna a job?\\
163 - Sure, Donna knows
her way around a car.\\
164 - But Eric thinks an exhaust belt\\
165 - is something that holds up
your pants when you're tired.\\
166 - There's no such thing
as an exhaust belt, Bob.\\
167 - Well, then he thinks something
else is something else.\\
168 - You know, when you start a new
business, you need a gimmick.\\
169 - When I opened my store,
I rented a monkey.\\
170 - People drive 100 miles to see a
monkey, 200 if he's wearing a suit.\\
171 - And Bobby dressed up as Tarzan
and I dressed up as Jane.\\
172 - - Remember?
- Do I?\\
173 - Me Tarzan, you Jane.\\
174 - That's just what I said.\\
175 - Bob, I'll tell you
what my gimmick is gonna be.\\
176 - Good service at a fair price.\\
177 - Oh, please, leave that stuff
to the Japanese.\\
178 - Hey, Jeri.\\
179 - This is Fez, and he would like
to apply for the shampoo boy job.\\
180 - Yeah? Why do you wanna
be a shampoo boy?\\
181 - Because I love hair, on the
head, on the body, on the floor,\\
182 - and if there's one on
my salad, I enjoy it more.\\
183 - - Fez.
- Okay, maybe I got
a little carried away.\\
184 - The one on my salad,
I can take it or leave it.\\
185 - You're a little creepy.\\
186 - But you're cute, so I'll test you
on one of our regular clients.\\
187 - Yes. That's great, Fez.
I have complete faith in you.\\
188 - - You're gonna wash
Donna's hair.
- Oh.\\
189 - Um, you know, I'm kind of
exclusive with Paulette.\\
190 - I can't just test him on
anyone, he seems kind of pervy.\\
191 - She gets me.\\
192 - Okay, fine.\\
193 - But nothing other than your hands
touches nothing other than my head.\\
194 - Oh, thank you, Donna.
You're not gonna regret this.\\
195 - And that's the first time I
said that to a girl and meant it.\\
196 - Well, thanks for lunch, man.\\
197 - I gotta say,
a burger just tastes better\\
198 - when it's bought for you
by your new black dad.\\
199 - So, you must really
love Led Zeppelin.\\
200 - That's the oldest shirt I've ever
seen on someone who wasn't a bum.\\
201 - Hey, if God didn't want me
to wear it so much,\\
202 - he wouldn't have
made them rock so hard.\\
203 - Zep is cool, I caught them
back in '69, front row.\\
204 - Whoa.\\
205 - I did well with the ladies
that night.\\
206 - They probably thought
I was Jimi Hendrix.\\
207 - I told them I was Jimi Hendrix.\\
208 - - Smile.
- Jackie,\\
209 - I'm trying to have lunch here,
do you mind?\\
210 - Who cares about lunch, Steven?\\
211 - We need a picture of a parent
who's not under arrest.\\
212 - Listen, the reason
I wanted to see you was,\\
213 - I was thinking that maybe
you'd like to come work for me.\\
214 - I could teach you
the record store business.\\
215 - Well, I have stolen
a lot of records.\\
216 - I would like to learn
why people pay for them.\\
217 - You know what? I can't.
I just took another job today.\\
218 - Well, quit that job.\\
219 - You come work for me and we'll
kick butt at the father-son picnic.\\
220 - I'll even start a father-son
picnic just so we can kick butt.\\
221 - Man, that sounds really cool.
You know, I'll try and work it out.\\
222 - That's what I like to hear.\\
223 - Hey.\\
224 - But, Steven, you're gonna need
a picture for your Christmas card.\\
225 - So, Hyde, when my dad offered
you the job, what exactly did he say?\\
226 - Was it like, um,\\
227 - "Since I don't see my own son
here right now,\\
228 - "I might as well
just give you the job."\\
229 - I can't believe I got a job
from my dad and from Red.\\
230 - Now I have two jobs.\\
231 - It's like I'm a workaholic.\\
232 - I gotta tell you, that's not the
kind of holic I thought I'd be.\\
233 - Hyde, this is
really getting to you.\\
234 - I mean, look at you,
you're leaning forward,\\
235 - you got your sunglasses off,
you're freaking out.\\
236 - Well, this is an emotional
time for my Steven.\\
237 - His new daddy and his substitute
daddy are in a tug-of-war for his heart.\\
238 - Whoa, I thought we established
that Hyde doesn't have a heart.\\
239 - It was, no heart,
no brain, no courage.\\
240 - I'll just have to tell Red
I can't take the job.\\
241 - I mean, he'll understand.\\
242 - Wait, I'm the scarecrow?\\
243 - He's the one
who gets set on fire.\\
244 - Oh, yeah, that's me.\\
245 - Steven, I have
a little surprise for you.\\
246 - Pretty nice, huh?\\
247 - They already had a bunch of
patches that said "Steven."\\
248 - But I had a "Hyde" one custom-made
'cause I know that's what you prefer.\\
249 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Custom-made?\\
250 - He once got me a hat that said
"Erin" because it was "close enough."\\
251 - Uh, thanks, Red,
this is really cool.\\
252 - Yeah, well,
you can buy your own pants.\\
253 - Hyde, why didn't
you say anything?\\
254 - Because he is torn
between two daddies.\\
255 - Look, Steven, when you're in
a moral quandary, do what I do.\\
256 - Okay?
Put on some Donny Osmond,\\
257 - close your eyes
and ask yourself one question.\\
258 - Who's richer?\\
259 - Okay, Fez, this is your station.\\
260 - Donna, here's my pepper spray,
just in case.\\
261 - You owe me.\\
262 - Okay, let's see what we have
to work with here.\\
263 - Fez!\\
264 - Shouldn't you be doing
something with soap and water?\\
265 - Oh, so you want it
wet and soapy.\\
266 - Fez, I just want my hair washed.\\
267 - Oh, so you wanna call the shots.\\
268 - Don't do the silly "want" stuff.\\
269 - - Oh, so you want it silent?
- Fez.\\
270 - Okay, okay. Showtime.\\
271 - Now, you are about to
experience some feelings.\\
272 - My advice is, give in to them.\\
273 - Hey, come on in, look around.\\
274 - Heck, take a muffler
if you like.\\
275 - Tom, I'm just kidding.\\
276 - Don't touch anything
you're not gonna buy.\\
277 - WB, surprised to see you here.\\
278 - Well, I just wanted to see why Steven
would take a job at a muffler shop\\
279 - instead of working for me
in an office\\
280 - with air-conditioning
and a pension plan.\\
281 - I guess white folks
are just weird.\\
282 - And he didn't even think about
offering me the job, did he?\\
283 - Oh, well, honey, he just
didn't think you were a good fit.\\
284 - It's called Forman & Son.\\
285 - It doesn't say whose son.\\
286 - - What the hell are you doing?
- What?\\
287 - It's your first day on the job
and you're drinking?\\
288 - This is not summer camp,
you know.\\
289 - There's drinking at summer camp?\\
290 - Look, if you're not responsible
enough to handle yourself,\\
291 - then obviously
I made a big mistake.\\
292 - I hope there's another job out
there for you because you're fired.\\
293 - My dad told you he offered me
a job, didn't he?\\
294 - What?\\
295 - No. What?\\
296 - 'Cause I've heard you
fire a lot of people,\\
297 - and I've never heard you saying,\\
298 - "I hope there's another job
out there for you."\\
299 - You say, "I hope my foot
doesn't get stuck in your ass."\\
300 - Or, "Don't let my foot get stuck in
your ass on the way out the door."\\
301 - Or the classic, "I'm gonna
stick my foot in your ass."\\
302 - Listen, get out of here.\\
303 - Thanks, Red.\\
304 - You're such a softy.\\
305 - Are you lurking
behind everything?\\
306 - Well, it's the only way I get
to see your real emotions.\\
307 - So, I guess you have a job
to offer Eric, after all.\\
308 - Yeah, well, I guess I could
teach Eric something about cars.\\
309 - Maybe if I told him they were
called space mobiles, he'd take to it.\\
310 - Hey, Eric.\\
311 - How'd you like to work for me?\\
312 - Here? With you?\\
313 - Wow, Dad, that would mean a lot.\\
314 - Then it really
would be Forman & Son.\\
315 - - So, you'll take the job?
- Hell, no.\\
316 - Good.\\
317 - I mean, I don't wanna work.
This is my year off.\\
318 - Then why did you complain
all day about not getting the job?\\
319 - Oh, well, Mom, I just wanted
to get invited to the dance.\\
320 - I mean, I didn't want to dance.\\
321 - Hell, I don't even know
any of the steps.\\
322 - Honey, you are
a wonderful dancer.\\
323 - Hey, man.\\
324 - Is that job still available?
'Cause Red just fired me.\\
325 - - Sure. Job's yours.
- Cool.\\
326 - - When do I start?
- How about Monday?\\
327 - Ooh, Monday's are
gonna be tough for me.\\
328 - I find I'm fresher if I start
my work week on a Tuesday.\\
329 - Say, sometime after lunch?\\
330 - I'll see you Monday at 9:00.\\
331 - Let's call it 10:00.\\
332 - Jackie, Jackie.\\
333 - Fez shampooed my hair.\\
334 - And you were able to untie
yourself and get away?\\
335 - No, Jackie,
his hands were amazing.\\
336 - At one point, it was like
he had five extra fingers.\\
337 - Well, Donna, he is foreign.
He might.\\
338 - Ladies.\\
339 - Hi, Fez.\\
340 - Well, it's official.
I am shampoo boy.\\
341 - The word on the street is,\\
342 - you need to smoke a cigarette
after this boy lathers you up.\\
343 - I'm the one who said that.\\
344 - Fez, did you get taller?\\
345 - Well, I'm gonna
make an appointment.\\
346 - But I'm not using the
same sink as the old ladies.\\
347 - Oh, you'll use the sink
I tell you to use.\\
348 - Okay, Fez.\\
349 - Wow.\\
350 - Hey, Red. This is going great.\\
351 - Ah, yeah, it's going okay.\\
352 - But can you imagine
how great it would be going\\
353 - if he'd used the midget catering
company I told him about?\\
354 - Yeah, well, thanks, Bob,\\
355 - for not forcing some cockamamie
gimmick down my throat.\\
356 - Hey, I'd never do that.\\
357 - Kelso, plan's off.
Get it out of here.\\
358 - We got him for three more hours.\\
359 - I'm gonna see if
I can teach him how to drive.\\
360 - There's a butterfly
in the backyard. I'm on it.\\
361 - Okay, he's
after me. He's after me.\\
362 - Crap, that just made him mad.
\subsection {Episode 05: It's Only Rock and Roll}
1 - Doesn't anybody want
to ask me how I'm feeling?\\
2 - Well, of course. Eric, ask
your mother how she's feeling.\\
3 - - How are you feeling, Mom?
- Unneeded,
unnecessary and unloved.\\
4 - Oh, you set me up.\\
5 - Well, there's no one
for me to take care of.\\
6 - Steven's off with his dad,\\
7 - you're busy with your silly
not-working projects,\\
8 - and we haven't heard from
Laurie since she moved to Canada.\\
9 - Where bottomless dancing
is legal.\\
10 - Cheer up, Kitty. You'll
always have me to take care of.\\
11 - Oh, the way you eat,
you'll be dead long before me.\\
12 - You're the one that puts bacon
on everything.\\
13 - - I do not.
- Last week you put
bacon on ham.\\
14 - Fine! Everything's my fault.\\
15 - Man, I can't wait to be married.\\
16 - All right, fine.
Look, we could talk all day,\\
17 - but I see one little fella
that still needs your attention.\\
18 - We still have Schatzi?\\
19 - I thought he ran away.\\
20 - No, he's been hiding
underneath the house.\\
21 - For a year?\\
22 - Poor little fella, he's afraid
of the garden hose.\\
23 - Look, Mom, maybe you should stop
worrying about everyone else so much\\
24 - and start
thinking about yourself.\\
25 - Maybe you should find
something to enrich your life.\\
26 - Oh, may I suggest
the teachings of the Jedi?\\
27 - And may I suggest
the footing of your ass?\\
28 - This is not the ass
you're looking for.\\
29 - See, now you
don't know what to do.\\
30 - You guys, yesterday at the salon, I
gave a shampoo to Tina Simpson,\\
31 - and you know what?
She has a lumpy head.\\
32 - Oh, gross. I made out with her
in the 10th grade.\\
33 - If I had known she had a lumpy
head, I would have felt around up there.\\
34 - I mean it's gross,
but you wanna feel it, right?\\
35 - You guys, listen to this ad.
"Do you like to draw?"\\
36 - Well, I have been known to trace
my hand and turn it into a turkey.\\
37 - "If so, have your
artistic ability evaluated\\
38 - "by The Cartoon Academy
of Fort Lauderdale."\\
39 - Ooh, I think Picasso went there.\\
40 - All I have to do is send in my
drawing of Sanchez the Turtle\\
41 - and a money order for $19.95.\\
42 - Twenty bucks to get judged
by a panel of cartoon experts?\\
43 - I'd pay twice that.\\
44 - Steven, you cannot go to your first day
at your dad's company dressed like that.\\
45 - You're working there,
not digging a ditch to there.\\
46 - Jackie, he owns
a chain of record stores.\\
47 - This is the official uniform
of rock 'n' roll.\\
48 - I'm dressed to jam.\\
49 - I agree with Jackie.
You clean up so nice.\\
50 - Let the world see what I see.\\
51 - I'm sorry. I'm drawing Sanchez
the Turtle, and I made a little bubble\\
52 - where he's saying,
"What's the hurry, guys?"\\
53 - Watch your back, Doonesbury.\\
54 - All right. Steven, you
know, I really think you...\\
55 - Lay off, okay?
I'm dressed fine.\\
56 - Really? What's the job? Are they
looking for an entry-level hobo?\\
57 - Actually, I'm hoping to get
to listen to the records\\
58 - and pick which ones
the stores carry.\\
59 - In which case,
bye-bye, Andy Gibb.\\
60 - What do you have against
good-looking guys?\\
61 - You know, we're just like you,
except for much better-looking.\\
62 - You know what you should do?
Bring back swing music.\\
63 - Hey, sue me. I like a song
I can throw a lady around to.\\
64 - Hanging out\\
65 - Down the street\\
66 - The same old thing\\
67 - We did last week\\
68 - Not a thing to do\\
69 - But talk to you\\
70 - We're all all right\\
71 - We're all all right\\
72 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
73 - - Here's where
you'll be working, son.
- Oh, it's pretty grim.\\
74 - So, is this where we
interrogate the political prisoners?\\
75 - So, um, where's
all the records at?\\
76 - Right here. These papers
are the sales records\\
77 - for all of our stores in
the greater tri-county area.\\
78 - These aren't the kind of papers
I thought I'd be working with.\\
79 - I thought they'd be smaller and
wrapped around something illegal.\\
80 - Look, I don't wanna bum you out,
but we kind of have a dress code here.\\
81 - You're dressed pretty casual.\\
82 - Yeah, but this is silk.
You couldn't pull it off.\\
83 - Steven, I love your closet!
Where's your office?\\
84 - - Did you follow me here?
- And you never even saw me.\\
85 - See, the trick is, is to stay two
cars behind and one to the left.\\
86 - Oh, here, I brought you
a very special lunch,\\
87 - and it's wrapped
in a suit and tie!\\
88 - Wear it.\\
89 - A suit?
See, she has the right idea.\\
90 - Well, I told him to dress nicer.
But he's poor, and that's your fault.\\
91 - Steven, we're gonna be evaluating
store profits from last quarter.\\
92 - So your job is to go
through these records\\
93 - and to underline every
instance of the word "credit."\\
94 - That's what I'm gonna be doing
my whole first day?\\
95 - First day? Ha!
It'll take you a week.\\
96 - But if you get bored,
do what I do. Play golf.\\
97 - - I don't play golf.
- Good, you can't leave anyway.\\
98 - - What exactly are they doing?
- I'm not sure.\\
99 - I think it's like a karate
that kills you with jiggle.\\
100 - And that's how you do tai chi.
Are you boys ready to try?\\
101 - No, I think we need to watch
you two do it a little bit more.\\
102 - They're not
trying to learn, Mom.\\
103 - Otherwise, they wouldn't have
brought lawn chairs and Fudgsicles.\\
104 - Kelso, I thought you were
gonna start respecting women\\
105 - now that you have a daughter.\\
106 - I am, but you two
are grandfathered in.\\
107 - I really don't see
what the big deal is, Bob.\\
108 - We brought this tray
over to you full of cookies.\\
109 - You should have brought it back
full of cookies. That's all I'm saying.\\
110 - - What are you two doing?
- It's tai chi.\\
111 - It's an ancient form
of exercise and meditation.\\
112 - It originated in the Far East,
in a place called Los Angeles.\\
113 - It seems really interesting.
Can I try?\\
114 - Sure.\\
115 - I'd stay out here and try it with
you, but I'd rather go inside and eat.\\
116 - So the key is to relax
and find your inner peace.\\
117 - Seems a little exotic.\\
118 - But if this tai chi is half as good as
a mai tai, I'm sure I'm gonna love it.\\
119 - You're the new guy, huh?
I'm Dennis.\\
120 - I'm Hyde.\\
121 - Mondays, huh?\\
122 - I guess.\\
123 - Hey, you picked a good week to
start. We just got a new copy machine.\\
124 - It's already broken.\\
125 - I'm really unhappy.\\
126 - Okay. Donna was right. I do
need to start respecting women.\\
127 - So I decided to donate my entire
Playboy collection to the needy.\\
128 - Here you go, Fez.\\
129 - You're giving Fez
a box full of nudie magazines?\\
130 - It's like giving a monkey
a loaded gun.\\
131 - No, it's not.\\
132 - A monkey with a loaded gun
can hurt a lot of people.\\
133 - I can only hurt myself.\\
134 - But a monkey with a loaded gun
would be an awesome TV show.\\
135 - Everybody would be like, "Oh,
don't worry. It's just a monkey."\\
136 - And then, bam!\\
137 - Thanks for taking me
to get my tai chi supplies.\\
138 - What was that wonderful store
called again?\\
139 - Point Place Meditation Supply
and Dried Fruit Depot.\\
140 - Well, that is so clever.\\
141 - Really? Wow, your clever
threshold is really low.\\
142 - This colors a lot of the
compliments that you've given me.\\
143 - I just love my new buddy.\\
144 - You know,
I think it's called a Buddha.\\
145 - No, that is not even a word.\\
146 - Next, you'll tell me
butter is called booder.\\
147 - What's going on back here?\\
148 - Hey, look.
You got a thing of me!\\
149 - I am making this space
my tai chi area.\\
150 - So, you're going to be out
here, and I'll be in there alone?\\
151 - I love tai chi.\\
152 - Eric, I got a job for you.\\
153 - Go grab some cement
and secure that Bob statue.\\
154 - Okay, if that's a job,
then how much does that pay?\\
155 - It pays my foot
not going in your ass.\\
156 - So it's on credit, then. Good.\\
157 - Hey, Donna, look! Ho, ho, ho!\\
158 - I can't tell you how good it makes me
feel to look in here and see my own son.\\
159 - How's it going?\\
160 - Well, I'm kind of glad
there's not a window in here.\\
161 - I probably would
have jumped out of it.\\
162 - Ah, you kids with
your suicide jokes.\\
163 - Finally finished.\\
164 - Bad news, Hyde.\\
165 - Sales decided it
would be more efficient\\
166 - to Wite-Out the credits and
underline the debits instead.\\
167 - But... But...\\
168 - But I underlined credits.\\
169 - If you're interested, I have some stuff
that can help you get through the day.\\
170 - - Oh, I'm interested.
- Cool.\\
171 - Wait, what are you
talking about?\\
172 - What are you talking about?\\
173 - What are you talking about?\\
174 - What are you talking about?\\
175 - Licorice.\\
176 - Get out of my office!\\
177 - "Today is the first day
of the rest of your life."\\
178 - Oh.\\
179 - And finished.\\
180 - Eric, this looks
nothing like me.\\
181 - Oh, I wasn't drawing you. I just
wanted you to shut up for a little while.\\
182 - Steven! How
was your first day at work?\\
183 - Damn, Jackie. Can't I sit down and
have a beer before you start in on me?\\
184 - Sorry. It's the store in Skokie,
the numbers just don't add up.\\
185 - Hey, have you guys seen Fez?\\
186 - He was supposed to meet me
at The Hub, like, an hour ago.\\
187 - Where's the last place
you saw him?\\
188 - Uh, down in the basement
with a box full of Playboys.\\
189 - - Oh, my God.
- I'll get the first-aid kit.\\
190 - We're too late.\\
191 - He suffered
a massive horny attack.\\
192 - We're gonna need some Gatorade
and a couple of ice packs.\\
193 - Back off! They're mine!
They're all mine!\\
194 - Fez, we're here to help you.\\
195 - All right, you need to stop, 'cause
people gotta sit on this couch.\\
196 - Okay, I say we put him
and the couch out on the curb.\\
197 - No. Look, Fez.\\
198 - There's a reason that these
magazines only come once a month.\\
199 - You have to pace yourself.\\
200 - Do something else
besides look at pornography.\\
201 - What kind of a life is that?\\
202 - By the way, any plans you
had with me, they're now off.\\
203 - Until further notice.\\
204 - I'm having
trouble concentrating.\\
205 - Me, too. That dog is loud.\\
206 - What dog?\\
207 - Please stop barking, Schatzi.
Mommy's doing her tai chi.\\
208 - Not very considerate to bark
during Mommy's quiet time, Schatzi.\\
209 - Shut your freaking trap!\\
210 - This is so soothing.\\
211 - So, Steven,
your first day at work.\\
212 - I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be working there.\\
213 - I was getting a cup of coffee today,
this guy walks up to me and says,\\
214 - "Working hard
or hardly working?"\\
215 - I threw my powdered milk at him.\\
216 - See, that's what I'm looking
forward to about being an artist.\\
217 - Loving my job.\\
218 - And don't get me wrong, it can be
torture waiting for inspiration to strike.\\
219 - But it's nice, because\\
220 - that gives me time
to go bowling.\\
221 - Did you secure
that statue of Bob yet?\\
222 - I didn't.\\
223 - But I could give you an artist's
rendering of what that might look like.\\
224 - You're gonna end up
selling women's shoes.\\
225 - I don't know if I can hack it,
working in an office.\\
226 - My tolerance for following
directions is really low.\\
227 - Which is ironic, because your
tolerance for other things is really high.\\
228 - Steven, everybody
goes through the same thing.\\
229 - But the misery that you feel
now will eventually be broken up\\
230 - by stretches of time where you
will feel that you're happy.\\
231 - Of course, you're not happy.\\
232 - You're just too numb from your
hellish life to feel the pain.\\
233 - How was your day, Red?\\
234 - Pretty good, actually.\\
235 - Hey, WB, got a sec?\\
236 - Steven, I heard
what happened yesterday.\\
237 - Perhaps I should have been more
clear about our milk-throwing policy.\\
238 - Look, man, I don't think
I can work here anymore.\\
239 - Well, why not?\\
240 - I just...
I don't belong here.\\
241 - - Dennis?
- Tuesdays, huh?\\
242 - Get outta here!\\
243 - Look, I can't let you
quit on me.\\
244 - You don't know me that well.
I've quit on a lot of people.\\
245 - No, I mean,
I won't let you quit.\\
246 - You could have
a really great future,\\
247 - but you need somebody
to help you get started.\\
248 - I wasn't there for you when you
were growing up, so I wanna do this.\\
249 - Yeah, but a job?\\
250 - Can't you just, like,
buy me a stereo?\\
251 - You're the boss' son. You
really don't have to work that hard.\\
252 - All right.
I'll give it a week.\\
253 - But what am I supposed to do
with all those sales reports?\\
254 - Just give them to Dennis.
That's what I do.\\
255 - Fez, are you okay?\\
256 - I haven't seen you
look this awful\\
257 - since you found out Candy
Land's not a real country.\\
258 - It's the bunnies, man.\\
259 - I haven't slept in a week.\\
260 - It's only been one day.\\
261 - Fez, why would you
do this to yourself?\\
262 - 'Cause he can't get
anybody else to do it for him.\\
263 - I don't have the willpower to
keep these magazines, Kelso.\\
264 - I'm just a boy.\\
265 - Well, I'd take them
off your hands, but...\\
266 - I don't wanna
actually touch your hands.\\
267 - Okay, buddy.
I think you're better off.\\
268 - Just hand the magazines
over to me.\\
269 - All right.\\
270 - Fez, you're not letting go.\\
271 - Oh, sorry.\\
272 - You're still holding on.\\
273 - Look, a robot!\\
274 - Man, you fall for that
every time.\\
275 - Yeah? Well, one day,
there's gonna be a robot.\\
276 - And all you suckers
are gonna miss it.\\
277 - Red, why are you out here?\\
278 - I thought you were so excited
to have the house to yourself.\\
279 - I got lonely.\\
280 - I don't believe it. They think
I have, "No artistic talent."\\
281 - You know,
I'm beginning to suspect\\
282 - that The Cartoon Academy of
Fort Lauderdale isn't that legitimate.\\
283 - Okay, all right.\\
284 - Schatzi, it's time for you to have
some quiet time behind the wall.\\
285 - Well, I guess it's back
to hand turkeys for me.\\
286 - I don't know what that means,
but don't do it around here.\\
287 - Schatzi?\\
288 - You know, that statue was
supposed to bring you peace.\\
289 - And in a way, it did.\\
290 - Loving my job now, man.\\
291 - Being the boss' son
means never having to say,\\
292 - "You'll have it
by the end of the day."\\
293 - Guys, Fez is really
overdoing it with the Playboys.\\
294 - And this isn't like the time he
ate a case of Mars bars, either.\\
295 - They can't pump
your stomach for porn.\\
296 - I'm not so much worried
about Fez as I am Schatzi.\\
297 - He goes on the attack every
time he sees that Buddha statue.\\
298 - And, weirdly, Bob.
\subsection {Episode 06: Rip This Joint}
1 - Hi, honey,
welcome home from work.\\
2 - Oh, God, I love saying that.\\
3 - It's so much better than saying,\\
4 - "Welcome home from loitering
at the head shop."\\
5 - Oh, my God, Hyde,
five seconds have gone by\\
6 - and you haven't
ripped off your tie,\\
7 - or as you refer to it,
"the yoke of oppression."\\
8 - I forgot I was wearing it.\\
9 - Would you look at that?\\
10 - The dancing bear has become
accustomed to his cage.\\
11 - Why would you put
a dancing bear in a cage?\\
12 - He's entertaining you,
give him some room.\\
13 - No, Fez, what she's saying is\\
14 - that Hyde is becoming a
money-grubbing corporate zombie.\\
15 - Did you hear that, Steven?
We're gonna be rich.\\
16 - No, we're not, Jackie.\\
17 - I hate the Man. I'm still
dedicated to kicking his ass.\\
18 - I'm just doing it
from the inside,\\
19 - where I get a pension
and dental and stuff.\\
20 - Oh, don't worry, honey.
You're still a rebel.\\
21 - Give me two years, I'll have him speaking
French and writing thank you notes.\\
22 - Hyde's growing up so fast.\\
23 - Seems like just yesterday
we were swiping Playboys,\\
24 - trenching
Old Man Shinsky's yard,\\
25 - and cutting the brakes
on Fat Marvin's bike.\\
26 - I don't remember trenching
Old Man Shinsky's yard.\\
27 - Oh, that's 'cause
you didn't approve.\\
28 - I think your exact words were,
"That guy's worked hard on his yard."\\
29 - What's wrong with me?\\
30 - I don't want to
wake up in 20 years\\
31 - and realize that I haven't
harassed enough grouchy, old men.\\
32 - And I don't want to wake up in 20
years and realize this was all a dream.\\
33 - Wouldn't that be weird?\\
34 - If none of this was real.\\
35 - Okay, now I'm starting
to freak out a little.\\
36 - You know what?
I'm gonna trench a yard.\\
37 - Just, not if it's one of those pranks
that involves heights or touching bugs.\\
38 - I'm not... I...
No, I won't touch a bug.\\
39 - No, you just park your car
on someone's yard,\\
40 - and then you step on the gas,
throw it in drive and tear up the lawn.\\
41 - Then you go get fries and
talk about how awesome it was.\\
42 - You know what, you guys? I'm
gonna trench Old Man Shinsky's yard.\\
43 - In fact,
I'm gonna trench that yard\\
44 - like no yard has been trenched
in the history of yard trenching.\\
45 - Are you with me?\\
46 - - Yeah.
- Whatever.\\
47 - I said, are you with me?\\
48 - - Yeah.
- Whatever.\\
49 - Yeah!
That's what I like to hear.\\
50 - Hanging out\\
51 - Down the street\\
52 - The same old thing\\
53 - We did last week\\
54 - Not a thing to do\\
55 - But talk to you\\
56 - We're all all right\\
57 - We're all all right\\
58 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
59 - What are those for?\\
60 - Oh, no. What did you do?\\
61 - Why did you have to wear
something so revealing?\\
62 - It's just a friendly party,
for Pete's sake.\\
63 - This party's not for Pete,
it's for Kitty, dummy.\\
64 - They've been arguing
all the time lately.\\
65 - Last night, they did two hours
on, "I know you are, but what am I?"\\
66 - Did someone say "party"?\\
67 - There's no party.
Right, Kitty?\\
68 - Yes, there is a party, Red.\\
69 - Didn't you wonder
why I bought all that liquor?\\
70 - Honestly, no.\\
71 - Hey, thanks for inviting us
to your party, Mrs. Forman.\\
72 - We can't stay, though,
'cause Eric's gonna trench...\\
73 - A coat.\\
74 - A trench coat.\\
75 - Kitty, how could you have
a party without telling me?\\
76 - Maybe it's because
every time she tells you,\\
77 - you go through five stages,\\
78 - anger, fury, rage, super rage,\\
79 - and finally, cursing God for
bringing you into this world.\\
80 - I've been there.\\
81 - Why did you do it?\\
82 - So, what's the occasion, Kitty?\\
83 - According to Cosmo's latest quiz,
I have medium to low self-esteem.\\
84 - So the article suggested that I should
throw a party in celebration of me.\\
85 - - I've done that.
- I've done that.\\
86 - - You have, too?
- Isn't it fun?\\
87 - - Yeah.
- I know.\\
88 - Okay, guys, I've been thinking
about this trenching thing,\\
89 - and it's a little boring,\\
90 - but I think I figured out
a way to Formanize it.\\
91 - You mean make it more boring?\\
92 - No, I don't.\\
93 - I mean, I'm gonna
get out of the car,\\
94 - moon Old Man Shinsky
and then trench the yard.\\
95 - That's right, you've all now been witness
to the invention of the moon and trench.\\
96 - I don't know, Eric.
It seems risky.\\
97 - I mean, you're not fast,
you're uncoordinated\\
98 - and you're easily tripped.\\
99 - I mean, if you get out of
the car, you're a dead man.\\
100 - No, no, no. Not with me backing
him up as his first lieutenant.\\
101 - Oh, um, actually, you're not
my first lieutenant.\\
102 - Donna's my first lieutenant.\\
103 - I went from fiancee
to first lieutenant?\\
104 - What a year!\\
105 - How could you
pick a girl over me?\\
106 - Kelso, remember when we put eggs
in Sister Mary Catherine's mail slot,\\
107 - and you were the getaway driver?\\
108 - And when we needed to get
away, you had left to get ice cream.\\
109 - I was the getaway driver
and I got away.\\
110 - Man, you got Forman, Kelso,
an old man and a naked butt.\\
111 - This could go the kind of
wrong people write books about.\\
112 - I can't believe I'm not going.\\
113 - That's right.\\
114 - See, Steven decided he'd
rather hang out with his father\\
115 - at Kitty's
grown-up cocktail party.\\
116 - "I'm Hyde.
I'm going to a cocktail party."\\
117 - "I'm Hyde.
I'm going to a party with cocktails."\\
118 - What the hell
are you guys doing?\\
119 - I don't know but it's funny.\\
120 - Kitty, who are all these people?\\
121 - Well, they're my friends.\\
122 - I never introduced you
because I know you don't care.\\
123 - Thanks.\\
124 - Hey, WB, come on in.\\
125 - Hey, Steven, I thought
I had the wrong night.\\
126 - You white folks throw
a really quiet party.\\
127 - Yeah, wait till they bring out the
onion dip, all hell breaks loose.\\
128 - Hey, I want you guys to meet
my dad. This is William Barnett.\\
129 - He owns a chain
of record stores.\\
130 - He's rich.\\
131 - Jackie,
I don't know if I'd say...\\
132 - Ah, what the hell, yeah, I am.\\
133 - And, WB, this is Bob, who's
also done some work in retail,\\
134 - and Midge, who's also
been to some stores.\\
135 - It's true.\\
136 - Steven, you didn't tell me
your father was so handsome.\\
137 - Hey, what about me?\\
138 - Well, you didn't tell me either.\\
139 - Okay. Hello, hello.\\
140 - Let's kick off Kitty Fest
with a little game.\\
141 - How about Hide and Go to Sleep?\\
142 - When I blow this whistle,\\
143 - pair up with someone
and tell an anecdote about me.\\
144 - When I blow it again, pair up with someone else.\\
145 - And the person
who tells the cutest story\\
146 - will get a special mention
in my Christmas newsletter.\\
147 - That's a prize?\\
148 - Now, since there are
an odd number of people here,\\
149 - I'm afraid one unlucky person
is going to get left out of the fun.\\
150 - I'll fall on that grenade.
Good night, everybody.\\
151 - Okay, you guys, let's see if I have
everything I need for the moon and trench.\\
152 - Car, check. Lawn, check.\\
153 - Creamy white butt, check.\\
154 - Eric, wait.\\
155 - If you moon Old Man Shinsky,\\
156 - you're not gonna have time
to pull up your pants.\\
157 - And you can't run back to the
car with them around your ankles.\\
158 - - You think I shouldn't do it?
- No, hell, no.\\
159 - I think you
should do it pantsless.\\
160 - Eric, he's right.\\
161 - I mean you can barely run
with your pants on.\\
162 - The pants come off.\\
163 - Oh, great. Everybody's on board
when Eric wants to take his pants off,\\
164 - but when I do, we have
to leave the restaurant.\\
165 - It's go time.\\
166 - What's going on here?\\
167 - That's my butt!\\
168 - Whoo!\\
169 - Lock, Donna!\\
170 - Now for the trench.\\
171 - What's going on?
We're not moving.\\
172 - Oh, man,
you dropped your transmission.\\
173 - In English, Donna. In English.\\
174 - Your car, no go.\\
175 - I'm calling the police!\\
176 - But wait, I am the police. They
can't catch me here, we gotta go.\\
177 - I gotta stay with the car.\\
178 - We don't.\\
179 - Man, Donna,
what are we gonna do?\\
180 - - I love you, Eric.
- What? No. No, don't leave me.\\
181 - Oh, Kelso, buddy, thanks.
I knew you'd come back.\\
182 - Oh, I'm not really back.\\
183 - Since you didn't make me
first lieutenant,\\
184 - I'm just here to say,
"I got his pants!"\\
185 - You're right, Phyllis,
I am a talented mimic.\\
186 - "Hi, I'm Johnny Carson
and I'm on TV."\\
187 - Uh-oh, time to switch.\\
188 - Well, it's you and me.
This should be fun.\\
189 - So,\\
190 - you take out the trash?\\
191 - - No.
- I gotta do that then.\\
192 - Oh, this is terrible. Have we
run out of things to talk about?\\
193 - Oh, no, no. Let me see.\\
194 - I saw a squirrel
in the yard today.\\
195 - I love that squirrel.
I've been feeding him peanuts.\\
196 - Well, that explains why he took
the poison right out of my hand.\\
197 - Jackie, I don't know
what's going on with me.\\
198 - I just got paired up
with this bookkeeping guy\\
199 - who told me a story
about accounts receivable.\\
200 - Not only did I know
what he was talking about,\\
201 - I suggested he make a flowchart.\\
202 - Oh, my God,
you are so sexy right now.\\
203 - Say "flowchart" again.\\
204 - Kitty? Kitty?\\
205 - That was the third whistle, and
Midge and WB still haven't switched.\\
206 - Look at her laughing at him.
He's not even funny.\\
207 - I haven't once heard him say,
"Knock, knock."\\
208 - Okay, wait, I have a good one.
Knock, knock.\\
209 - Damn it.\\
210 - I'm not gonna stand for you throwing
yourself at every guy you meet.\\
211 - Midge, we're going home.\\
212 - Until you're ready to trust
me, I'm not going anywhere.\\
213 - In fact, I'm leaving.\\
214 - - Where are you going?
- To lock myself
in your bathroom.\\
215 - What's wrong with your bathroom?\\
216 - I can't go there, there's too many painful
memories of sexy showers with Bob.\\
217 - See, I told you people do that.\\
218 - Look, man,
please don't call my dad.\\
219 - If he hears about this,
he's gonna kill me.\\
220 - I don't mean figuratively, he would
literally kill me with his bare hands.\\
221 - He will kill me like he has
killed oh-so-many squirrels.\\
222 - Settle down. You're 18.
I'm not gonna call your dad.\\
223 - I want my daddy.\\
224 - Donna.\\
225 - They said I could
visit you for 10 minutes.\\
226 - It's good to see a friendly face.
Jail's no place for me, Donna.\\
227 - I'm too pretty.\\
228 - Eric, you're gonna be fine.\\
229 - Plus, I brought something
that you really need.\\
230 - Tell me it's pants.\\
231 - Oh.\\
232 - Crap, I knew I forgot something.\\
233 - But how do Milk Duds sound?\\
234 - Kind of like they won't cover
the lower half of my body.\\
235 - All right.
Visiting hours are over.\\
236 - Fine, he's cranky anyway.\\
237 - All right, Kelso, awesome.
Get me out of here.\\
238 - Shut up, punk.\\
239 - You know, around here
we have a saying.\\
240 - Is it, "Everyone down,
Kelso's got a gun"?\\
241 - No. It's, "Kelso gets
to be first lieutenant."\\
242 - But now, sir,
you are a criminal,\\
243 - and you will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of my imagination.\\
244 - Midge, please come out
so you can talk to Bob.\\
245 - I can't do that, Kitty.\\
246 - You mean you don't know how?\\
247 - The lock is on the doorknob.\\
248 - No, I mean
I'm not coming out.\\
249 - But thank you, I see it now.\\
250 - - I wanna go to sleep.
- Me, too.\\
251 - Well, I wanted one night
that was just about me,\\
252 - and now everything's
about Midge.\\
253 - It's not enough
that she's got legs up to here\\
254 - and the you-know-whats
out to you-know-where.\\
255 - Now she's gotta upstage me
on my big night.\\
256 - Well, you just
get over yourself, lady.\\
257 - You know, I never thought
I'd be saying this,\\
258 - but how's about you and me
get a motel room?\\
259 - I'd like that.\\
260 - Okay, I'm starting to shake
off this whole flowchart thing.\\
261 - Can't even remember
what a flowchart is.\\
262 - Can't even remember
what I just said.\\
263 - Hey, which one of you jerks
put this tie on me?\\
264 - Steven, focus,
you're a businessman.\\
265 - You love work and money and me.\\
266 - Hold on to that.\\
267 - Oh, you know what? You're
gonna forget. I'll write it down.\\
268 - Oh, you guys missed
a glorious trenching.\\
269 - Eric's tiny butt gleaming
in the moonlight,\\
270 - shining brighter
than the brightest star.\\
271 - It was like a Disney movie.\\
272 - Yeah.
Eric's rear end is white.\\
273 - Sometimes I can't even tell
if he's wearing underwear.\\
274 - Tonight, in that jail cell, he's
gonna glow like a little lightning bug.\\
275 - Forman's in jail and I spent my
entire night at a cocktail party?\\
276 - I gotta go break some laws or
I'm never gonna forgive myself.\\
277 - Hey, which one of you jerks
put this tie on me?\\
278 - I know what
you're thinking, punk.\\
279 - Is that gun real or fake?\\
280 - Well, the gun is green,\\
281 - but it's also plastic
so it's anyone's guess.\\
282 - Well, then you have to ask
yourself one question, punk.\\
283 - "Do I like being squirted
with grape juice?"\\
284 - - Well, do you?
- Okay. Quit it, quit it.\\
285 - - You're gonna be all sticky.
- Thank you.\\
286 - Okay, Mr. Shinsky, once you've identified
the culprit you can file a formal complaint.\\
287 - That's him. I'd recognize that
creamy-ass moron anywhere.\\
288 - Oh, yeah, he was there, too.\\
289 - What me? No, no. No, no, no.\\
290 - I was undercover,\\
291 - infiltrating the underworld
trenching world.\\
292 - And it goes a lot deeper
than you might think.\\
293 - The whole middle school
might be involved.\\
294 - Okay.\\
295 - In you go, Kelso.\\
296 - Come on,
you're putting me in jail?\\
297 - Maybe a few hours in the can will
give you a new respect for the law.\\
298 - But that's the thing, it won't.\\
299 - I hope Midge isn't going
through my medicine cabinet.\\
300 - I've got some pills in there
and they are not for amateurs.\\
301 - What's going on?\\
302 - Your loony mother has
locked herself in my bathroom.\\
303 - I'll handle this.\\
304 - Mom, the lock
is on the doorknob.\\
305 - That's it, Midge.\\
306 - Come out now
or I'm kicking down the door.\\
307 - If you kick down that door,
you're gonna have to put it back up.\\
308 - You take the fun out
of everything, Red.\\
309 - Mom, if you won't come out, will
you at least let Dad come in there?\\
310 - How could you think I
was flirting with another man?\\
311 - Maybe I overreacted,
you're a beautiful woman.\\
312 - So are you, Bob.\\
313 - What the hell are
they doing in there?\\
314 - All right, sorry about tonight.\\
315 - It just really hurt my feelings\\
316 - when you didn't make me first
lieutenant on the Shinsky job.\\
317 - I'm sorry, too.\\
318 - I guess I never realized\\
319 - how seriously you take imaginary
ranks assigned by your friends.\\
320 - Well, now you know.\\
321 - Well, after a long night
of hashing things out,\\
322 - we all decided that my parents
are better off apart.\\
323 - So we took my mom
to the airport this morning.\\
324 - She headed back to California?\\
325 - I hope so.\\
326 - I taped the ticket to her purse.\\
327 - You're coming home
in your underwear again?\\
328 - I'm gonna paint
some damn pants on you.\\
329 - Okay, but in my defense,\\
330 - this time I took off
my pants by choice.\\
331 - I don't know where
we went wrong with you.\\
332 - We take you to church,\\
333 - we try to raise you to be
a decent human being,\\
334 - and yet you turn out to be
a bottomless deviant.\\
335 - Okay, Red, the shower's running.\\
336 - You promised.\\
337 - Stick my eggs in the oven.
I'll be back in five minutes.\\
338 - Freeze, punk face!\\
339 - Hyde!\\
340 - What are you in for?\\
341 - Let's just say Old Man Shinsky's
yard has been professionally trenched.\\
342 - Did the rose bushes, too.
It's sort of my calling card.\\
343 - This feels good.\\
344 - This feels right.
\subsection {Episode 07: Mother's Little Helper}
1 - Eric.\\
2 - I found this in the garage
and I want an explanation.\\
3 - Okay, when people write stories
and glue the pages together,\\
4 - it forms what we call a book.\\
5 - I don't want The Joy of Sex
polluting my house.\\
6 - The Joy of Sex.
What a load of crap.\\
7 - That book's for perverts, Red.\\
8 - You should give it to me
so I can sell it to Fez.\\
9 - Red, the book is mine.\\
10 - I put it in the garage
so you would find it.\\
11 - Uh-oh. I'm late for work.\\
12 - No, no, no.
I am serious.\\
13 - It's high time you and I put
some zip back in the bedroom.\\
14 - Eww!\\
15 - I got a great idea.\\
16 - We'll put a TV in the bedroom,
there's your zip.\\
17 - Okay, I want
the full Fez treatment.\\
18 - A wash, cream rinse, and a lot of
that wiggly stuff you do with your fingers.\\
19 - It's magical.\\
20 - Abracadabra, baby.\\
21 - So, Danielle,
what's on your schedule today?\\
22 - I mean,
besides looking beautiful.\\
23 - Well, looking beautiful is from
10:00 to 12:00, then I have a date.\\
24 - Ooh, hot date alert.\\
25 - Tsss!\\
26 - It's not that hot.\\
27 - The guy's kind of a knucklehead.\\
28 - I mean, he's really cute,\\
29 - but it's like when I talk, he's
not paying attention to me.\\
30 - Ugh!\\
31 - I hear this complaint
20 times a day.\\
32 - You're a treasure.\\
33 - He should worship you
like a big stone head.\\
34 - You're so great. You
know, you really get women.\\
35 - Well, if you mean "get" as in
"understand," then yes, I get them.\\
36 - But if you mean
"get" as in "get,"\\
37 - then, no, never.\\
38 - If I had a woman like you,\\
39 - I would give her anything
her heart desired.\\
40 - Maybe I should blow off my
date and go out with a guy like you.\\
41 - And when I say "a guy like
you," I mean you, specifically.\\
42 - Wow.\\
43 - But just to be clear, I still
have a tip coming, right?\\
44 - Hanging out\\
45 - Down the street\\
46 - The same old thing\\
47 - We did last week\\
48 - Not a thing to do\\
49 - But talk to you\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
53 - Steven.\\
54 - Steven, would you
please stop doing that?\\
55 - You're gonna get all Eric-y.\\
56 - Give.\\
57 - Jackie, boys have to play fight\\
58 - because they secretly
wanna touch each other.\\
59 - Yeah, you guys wish
you could play fight.\\
60 - But girls can't, 'cause it
always turns into a real fight.\\
61 - Are you seriously telling me\\
62 - that if Jackie and I wanted
to play fight, we couldn't?\\
63 - Um, let me listen for the echo
of what I just said.\\
64 - "Girls can't play fight..."
Yep, that's what I think.\\
65 - I agree. Girls are bitches.\\
66 - Really?\\
67 - - Come on,
Jackie, put your dukes up.
- Okay.\\
68 - Watch and learn, boys.\\
69 - See? It's all fun and games.\\
70 - - Ow, you scratched me!
- Aah!\\
71 - Get off of me, Bigfoot!\\
72 - Let go of my hair
or I'll pound your tiny ass!\\
73 - Spoilsport.\\
74 - Hey, yours was gonna kill mine.\\
75 - Ladies, that was pathetic.\\
76 - - What? That wasn't
even real. We're fine.
- Yeah.\\
77 - I don't know what you're
talking about. I had fun.\\
78 - Oh, you're so immature!\\
79 - You guys aren't
going to believe this!\\
80 - Wait. Were two hot
girls just fighting in here?\\
81 - No.\\
82 - Someone is lying.\\
83 - Anyway.\\
84 - I was just shampooing this foxy girl,
Danielle, and the next thing I know,\\
85 - we're making out in
the shampoo closet.\\
86 - Wait a second.\\
87 - You're trying to tell me that
you were shampooing a girl\\
88 - and she got so horny,\\
89 - she had to make out with you
in the shampoo closet?\\
90 - That doesn't sound real, man.
That sounds like a Mad Lib.\\
91 - Yeah, are you sure you
weren't just kissing a mop?\\
92 - 'Cause, man, I've
seen you do that.\\
93 - No, no.\\
94 - Danielle kept going on and on\\
95 - about this adorable
knucklehead she was dating,\\
96 - and I just sympathized
with her problems.\\
97 - Well, that makes sense.\\
98 - I mean, all a woman really
wants is a man who listens.\\
99 - I listen.\\
100 - And doesn't pat
himself on the back.\\
101 - I never pat myself on the back.\\
102 - So, yeah,
I got that going for me.\\
103 - You guys,
something happened today\\
104 - that has never
happened to me before.\\
105 - Oh, you did long division?\\
106 - No, I got stood up.\\
107 - I was supposed to
meet this girl, Danielle,\\
108 - after her haircut
and she never showed.\\
109 - - Danielle.
- Danielle?\\
110 - Okay, wait a second. First
a girl fight and now this?\\
111 - I vote, "Best Day Ever."\\
112 - Kelso was
the adorable knucklehead.\\
113 - Hey, thanks, Fez, but I'm
trying to tell a story here.\\
114 - Okay, so I've been trying to
figure out why she didn't show,\\
115 - and I've come to the
only logical conclusion,\\
116 - she's dead.\\
117 - Kelso, maybe Danielle met a
guy that she likes better than you.\\
118 - Don't be crazy, Fez.\\
119 - Danielle is dead and
we can never bring her back.\\
120 - Kitty, we don't need
The Joy of Sex.\\
121 - Well, why not?
It's not dirty.\\
122 - This book, it doesn't even
have photographs,\\
123 - just sketches.\\
124 - But they're so detailed.\\
125 - They draw in every single part,\\
126 - and it's not to scale.\\
127 - Oh, here's a fun idea.\\
128 - Okay.\\
129 - Instead of throwing away
our old dish towels,\\
130 - we can use them as blindfolds\\
131 - and play a sexy bedroom
version of Marco Polo.\\
132 - Oh, come on. Don't you want to
be one of those fun, older couples?\\
133 - Kitty, I want us to grow old
and withdraw into ourselves.\\
134 - Hey, what's for lunch?\\
135 - Well, I was thinking
of making something,\\
136 - but that would mean I would
have to look at a cookbook,\\
137 - and I don't like to learn
new things from books.\\
138 - Yeah, so is lunch off, or...\\
139 - I mean, what's the lay
of the lunch land, here?\\
140 - I don't see why I have to
read a book on bodily functions.\\
141 - I've never read
a book on eating,\\
142 - yet I'm extremely well fed.\\
143 - But I'm not.
Could I get, like...\\
144 - Seriously, like a sandwich or...\\
145 - Well, you know what?\\
146 - Nobody is eating unless
you give this book a try.\\
147 - Until then, I quit cooking.\\
148 - Wow, I can't believe
I'm asking you this,\\
149 - but please have
kinky sex with my mother.\\
150 - No, Danielle,
I love your outfit,\\
151 - but I just think you
can always go tighter.\\
152 - Oh, my God,
Danielle, you're alive!\\
153 - Yeah, why wouldn't I be?\\
154 - Well, then if you're not dead,\\
155 - then why did you
blow off our date?\\
156 - Look at him try
and put it together.\\
157 - Oh, he's got it now.\\
158 - No, wait, he doesn't.\\
159 - Yeah, now...
Wow, not yet. Wow.\\
160 - This is, like,
the slowest burn ever.\\
161 - This is like how burns were in
the 1800s before we had electricity.\\
162 - Danielle stood you up
so she could make out\\
163 - with the adorable
new man in her life.\\
164 - Ah, me.\\
165 - That's right. Ah, him.\\
166 - Don't bump me.\\
167 - Don't get in my way.\\
168 - Well, maybe I wouldn't
be in your way\\
169 - if you could sit still
like a normal person\\
170 - instead of a vibrating spazoid.\\
171 - Really. Well, guess what?\\
172 - You fight like a poor girl.\\
173 - Get off of me!\\
174 - Let go of my hair
or I'll pound you.\\
175 - This ain't over, squatty!\\
176 - Get off. I'm going.\\
177 - Hey, if they're going
to keep this up,\\
178 - we should invest
in a video camera.\\
179 - All right, Fez. Stand up
so I can kick your ass.\\
180 - How dare you steal a girl
out from under me?\\
181 - First of all,
I can do whatever I want.\\
182 - Second of all, when I saw her,
she was not under you.\\
183 - She was under moi.\\
184 - - That's it.
- Whoa, whoa! Guys, listen!\\
185 - I just realized I am not strong
enough to hold you two apart.\\
186 - Hyde, come on!\\
187 - Kelso.\\
188 - Maybe you shouldn't be
asking what he did,\\
189 - you should be asking
what you did to let it happen.\\
190 - Or what you didn't do.\\
191 - You know, maybe you
just lost your mojo.\\
192 - Look, a guy can't
just lose his mojo, okay?\\
193 - Can he?\\
194 - Well, when was the last time you
made out with two girls at once?\\
195 - Well, that was...\\
196 - Oh, no.\\
197 - I can't remember.\\
198 - Kissed four different
girls in the same day?\\
199 - I don't know!\\
200 - You guys,
I might have lost my mojo.\\
201 - And I got it.
I got your mojo.\\
202 - Which reminds me,
I also have your yo-yo, so...\\
203 - You know what?
I want them both back.\\
204 - Now, how can I
lose a girl to you?\\
205 - You don't even speak English.\\
206 - Well, Kelso,
look at the bright side.\\
207 - Danielle is a wonderful girl
who likes me better than you.\\
208 - Why is that the bright side?\\
209 - Because...
Burn!\\
210 - These are stale.\\
211 - Well, eat slow.
We gotta make them last.\\
212 - Hey, Red.\\
213 - Eric told me you and Kitty
are having a little trouble\\
214 - in the old hee-hoo department.\\
215 - You told Bob?\\
216 - Are you out of your puny mind?\\
217 - Look, you have to work
this stuff out with Mom.\\
218 - She hasn't fed us in three days.\\
219 - Dad, I can't afford not to eat.\\
220 - Yesterday, I ate
a raisin off the floor.\\
221 - I'm not even sure if
it was really a raisin.\\
222 - Look, Red.\\
223 - You should take Kitty's request
for a love life spice up seriously.\\
224 - When Midge wanted to
turbo-charge our love life,\\
225 - it was really a symptom of a
much deeper marital problem.\\
226 - Yeah, that you were deviants.\\
227 - Deviants?\\
228 - Well, the couple we were
dating sure didn't seem to think so.\\
229 - I'm telling you, this
problem is not just about sex.\\
230 - It isn't?\\
231 - Well, maybe she's just
unhappy emotionally.\\
232 - Wouldn't that be wonderful?\\
233 - No, Red. It means
you have a problem,\\
234 - and you have to deal with it.\\
235 - Yeah, okay.\\
236 - Yeah, I guess it's important
that Kitty get listened to.\\
237 - Eric, go listen to your mother.\\
238 - Why me?\\
239 - Because without food,
you'll die first.\\
240 - So, Danielle, tell me again\\
241 - how much more you
like me than Kelso.\\
242 - Well, you're sensitive\\
243 - and thoughtful and understanding\\
244 - and very, very sexy.\\
245 - Lady, don't ever stop talking.\\
246 - And you're funny and sweet.\\
247 - And did I mention?
Very, very sexy.\\
248 - Lady, you gotta shut up.\\
249 - So, Mom, in the interest
of returning\\
250 - regular meal service
to my now shattered life,\\
251 - I'm here to help.\\
252 - So just tell me the problem
beneath the dirty, gross problem.\\
253 - Honey, there is none.\\
254 - I just want your father
and me to have\\
255 - more adventurous
sexual intercourse.\\
256 - Well, this is one of those times\\
257 - I'm kind of happy
my stomach's empty.\\
258 - Um, look, instead of calling it,\\
259 - uh, sexual inter...\\
260 - Instead of calling it that,\\
261 - why don't we call it, like,
a walk in the park?\\
262 - Fine. I want your father and I\\
263 - to have more adventurous
walks in the park.\\
264 - I want to walk in
the park in the kitchen.\\
265 - Walk in the park on a Tuesday.\\
266 - I even want to walk in
the park in the park.\\
267 - Okay, okay, okay. Okay.\\
268 - Okay, Mom. I think you're
playing this all wrong.\\
269 - Dad wants you to have
a deeper emotional issue.\\
270 - Invent one.\\
271 - He'll give you anything you want\\
272 - to avoid talking
about walks in the park.\\
273 - So think big. You know, I might
be able to get you diamonds here.\\
274 - Maybe even a new car.\\
275 - This is like emotional
Price is Right, baby.\\
276 - You're in the Showcase.\\
277 - Oh, I also want to walk in the
park during The Price is Right.\\
278 - Oh, God.\\
279 - Well, what's the news?\\
280 - You better start studying.\\
281 - Ugh!\\
282 - All right.\\
283 - So I spent the whole day thinking
about what happened with Danielle.\\
284 - And I realized that I
shouldn't be mad at you.\\
285 - I should be asking you for help.\\
286 - Holy crap, man. Now you're
asking Fez for girl advice?\\
287 - Next thing you know, Donna's gonna
be asking Forman how to throw a ball.\\
288 - Look, he's the one
with the girl.\\
289 - All right, Fez.
So where did I go wrong?\\
290 - Well, Danielle said
you were a bad listener\\
291 - and I'm a good listener.
I heard her.\\
292 - But so what?
I hurt girls all the time.\\
293 - No, not "hurt."
"Heard." I heard.\\
294 - You heard what?\\
295 - Danielle!
I heard Danielle!\\
296 - Well, why'd she
choose you over me?\\
297 - Jeez, it's like talking
to a two-year-old, here.\\
298 - She chose Fez because he
listens when a woman talks\\
299 - instead of staring at her chest.\\
300 - Stop staring at my chest!\\
301 - I'm sorry, look, I've been
screwed by Darwinism.\\
302 - I never needed to
evolve listening skills,\\
303 - 'cause my looks are
so highly developed.\\
304 - Oh, that's not
how evolution works.\\
305 - Yeah, sure it is.\\
306 - Look, say I had to catch
my own food, right,\\
307 - but I only ate
really fast animals?\\
308 - My feet would eventually
evolve into rockets.\\
309 - Man, it's amazing your brain
doesn't evolve into pudding.\\
310 - All right, Fez.
Come on, I need your help.\\
311 - Why should I help you?\\
312 - Because you owe me.\\
313 - Think about all
the times that I set you up\\
314 - with my dates'
less-pretty friends.\\
315 - That's true. You have
thrown me some uggos.\\
316 - All right, so show
a little appreciation.\\
317 - Fine.\\
318 - But you have to promise not to
use what I teach you on Danielle\\
319 - to get her back.\\
320 - - She's mine.
- Done.\\
321 - Okay, Donna.
I need your help.\\
322 - Now sit here and
pretend to be a girl.\\
323 - Now tell a girly story.\\
324 - Kelso, you listen and repeat
back whatever she says.\\
325 - - Okay, ready?
- Yeah.\\
326 - Kelso, I had the worst day.\\
327 - I didn't know what shoes to
wear. With a heel, without a heel...\\
328 - I'm running
out of firecrackers.\\
329 - I bet I could have been
best friends with Spider-Man.\\
330 - Is that a new muscle?\\
331 - Well, hello, new muscle.
Welcome to Kelso-town.\\
332 - Kelso.\\
333 - Kelso!\\
334 - - What?
- You weren't even listening.\\
335 - How do you know?\\
336 - 'Cause you were staring at the
ceiling with your tongue hanging out.\\
337 - Kelso, when a woman talks,
you have to look her in the eyes\\
338 - and pretend her
words are like oxygen\\
339 - and without them,
you can't breathe.\\
340 - But I don't care what she says.\\
341 - How the heck did
you ever get a girl?\\
342 - I don't know.
I just stare at her\\
343 - until she stops talking
and then I kiss her.\\
344 - Unbelievable.\\
345 - All right, Kitty.\\
346 - I want you to be happy.
I really do.\\
347 - And to make that beautiful,
elusive dream come true,\\
348 - I'm willing to try page 46.\\
349 - Really?\\
350 - Oh, Red, thank you.\\
351 - Oh.\\
352 - Page 46.
That is so fancy.\\
353 - What?\\
354 - Oh, dear God, no. Not...\\
355 - Not page 46.
I meant page 47.\\
356 - Page 47.\\
357 - And no funny stuff
after I fall asleep.\\
358 - And I didn't know what to do
because I had just polished my nails\\
359 - and I didn't want to
mess up my manicure.\\
360 - You're such a good listener.
I can't take it anymore.\\
361 - What are you doing?
Get off my lady!\\
362 - - Fez!
- You shut your
hot little mouth.\\
363 - You promised you wouldn't use
anything I taught you on Danielle.\\
364 - Come on, you can't give me a gun\\
365 - and expect me not to
shoot people with it.\\
366 - Danielle, you have to choose.
Him or me?\\
367 - - But I...
- I said choose, woman.\\
368 - Well, Fez, if I have to choose
between the two of you,\\
369 - I mean, the choice is obvious.\\
370 - I choose you, Fez.\\
371 - What, are you stupid?\\
372 - I mean, of course,
yes, good choice, yeah.\\
373 - What, him?
How can you choose him?\\
374 - I don't know. I guess I have this
thing for guys who boss me around.\\
375 - I'll meet you in the car, or
wherever you tell me to meet you.\\
376 - Oh, you'll meet me in the car,
and you'll like it.\\
377 - I will.\\
378 - Okay, here's the thing, Fez.\\
379 - She's clearly a lunatic.\\
380 - Which means that she's going
to be super hot in bed,\\
381 - so congratulations on that one.\\
382 - But you did snake her from me,
so I get a free punch.\\
383 - But you did
snake her back, so...\\
384 - Oh!\\
385 - How do guys play fight
without getting into a real fight?\\
386 - Well, maybe 'cause
when they fight,\\
387 - Michael doesn't elbow
everything like a blonde tard-o.\\
388 - See, now that is gonna get
your ass kicked.\\
389 - Oh, I'm gonna punch you
in your fat melon head.\\
390 - Good luck reaching it,
tiny loser.\\
391 - Thanks, Tommy!\\
392 - Is that bacon I smell?\\
393 - Oh, what a perfect morning.\\
394 - - Marco!
- Polo!\\
395 - Oh, my God!
\subsection {Episode 08: Angie}
1 - HEY, THANKS FOR COMING DOWN
TO MEET MY SISTER, MAN.\\
2 - I HAD DINNER WITH HER
AND MY DAD LAST NIGHT.\\
3 - AND IT WAS THE FIRST FAMILY
DINNER I'D EVER BEEN TO\\

SNEAK OUT OF THE RESTAURANT\\
5 - ONE AT A TIME.\\
6 - MAN, HYDE, FIRST A NEW DAD,

THEM, IF YOU JUST YELL\\
18 - "FREE BIRD" REALLY LOUD,
THEY'LL START PLAYING IT.\\

28 - A MATH MAJOR? AWESOME.\\
29 - I NEED SOME HELP BUILDING
A HOMEMADE ROCKET.\\
30 - AND WE ALSO
NEED A HAMSTER\\
31 - THAT'S NOT AFRAID OF
HEIGHTS OR BEING BLOWN UP.\\
32 - YOU MUST BE KELSO.\\
33 - YEAH, I AM.\\
34 - BOY, AM I GLAD YOU
SHOWED UP.\\
35 - IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE BEING
THE ONLY GOOD-LOOKING ONE\\
36 - IN THE ROOM.\\
37 - MICHAEL,
THAT IS SO RUDE.\\
38 - YOU KNOW THERE'S
TWO OF US.\\
39 - AND THAT
MAKES YOU JACKIE.\\
40 - THAT'S RIGHT!\\
41 - HI!\\
42 - OK, SO LET ME BRING
YOU UP TO SPEED\\
43 - ON THE GROUP.\\
44 - TOO SKINNY, TOO TALL,
TOO HORNY, TOO FOREIGN,\\
45 - TOO-RIFIC.\\

TOGETHER AND GETTING ALONG.\\
47 - HA HA. THAT'S IT, 20 BUCKS
FOR EVERYBODY.\\
48 - IT'S OK. I ALREADY

49 - I TOOK IT
OFF YOUR DESK.\\
50 - I'M AT A REALLY WEIRD
PLACE IN MY LIFE.\\
51 - HANGIN' OUT\\
52 - DOWN THE STREET\\
53 - THE SAME OLD THING\\
54 - THAT YOU DID LAST WEEK\\
55 - NOT A THING TO DO\\
56 - BUT TALK TO YOU\\

58 - WE'RE ALL
ALL RIGHT\\
59 - Kelso: HELLO, WISCONSIN!\\
60 - HEY, MAN.\\
61 - HEY! I BROUGHT
EVERYONE CUPCAKES.\\
62 - COOL! COOL! CUPCAKES!\\
63 - HERE'S A SPECIAL ONE
FOR YOU...\\
64 - VANILLA ON THE OUTSIDE
AND CHOCOLATE ON THE INSIDE.\\
65 - OHH! WAIT.\\
66 - WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?\\
67 - YOU KNEW I WAS
GONNA TAKE THAT ONE.\\
68 - OH, WELL, TOO LATE.\\
69 - YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE
ALWAYS DOING THAT.\\
70 - THAT IS THE REASON
WHY WE BROKE UP.\\
71 - WE BROKE UP BECAUSE YOU
WERE ALWAYS CHEATING ON ME.\\
72 - THAT AND
THE CUPCAKE THING.\\
73 - SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU HANG OUT, HUH?\\
74 - DO THE PEOPLE
WHO OWN THIS PLACE\\
75 - KNOW WE'RE DOWN HERE?\\
76 - YEAH, THEY KIND
OF ADOPTED ME.\\
77 - YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS ABOUT ME,\\
78 - BUT I'VE HAD,
LIKE, 13 DADS.\\
79 - YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.\\
80 - I MEAN, LIKE,\\
81 - WHAT KIND OF STUFF
DID YOU DO GROWING UP?\\
82 - DID YOU PLAY SPORTS?\\
83 - WELL, I USED TO PLAY
THIS ONE GAME CALLED STOOP.\\
84 - WHAT YOU DO IS
YOU SIT ON A STOOP\\
85 - AND YOU CHUCK THINGS
AT PASSERSBY.\\
86 - I WAS A PRO.\\
87 - I WAS A PASSERBY.\\
88 - DID YOU KNOW THAT
I AM A SHAMPOO BOY\\
89 - DOWN AT
THE BEAUTY SALON?\\
90 - YES, LADIES COME
FROM MILES AROUND\\
91 - TO BE TOUCHED
BY THESE MAGIC HANDS.\\
92 - IS THAT WHY THEY'RE
ALL DRY AND CHAPPED?\\
93 - NO.\\
94 - THAT'S FROM
MY DAY OFF.\\
95 - SO, ANGIE, ARE YOU EXCITED
ABOUT YOUR FIRST DAY AT WORK\\
96 - AT DAD'S OFFICE
TOMORROW?\\
97 - YEAH, BUT I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS.\\
98 - I MEAN, IT'S MY FIRST
JOB OUT OF COLLEGE.\\
99 - OH, BELIEVE ME, THIS IS THE
EASIEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD.\\
100 - WAIT. WHAT ABOUT THE TIME YOU
GOT PAID 2 BUCKS TO EAT EVERYTHING\\
101 - OUT OF FORMAN'S FRIDGE
AND THEN YOU THREW IT UP\\
102 - ALL OVER THE PLACE?\\
103 - THAT WAS YOU.\\
104 - OH, YEAH.\\
105 - HA HA!
THAT WAS AWESOME.\\
106 - SO IT'S COOL IF WE
SLACK OFF AT WORK.\\
107 - LOOK, ANYTIME I EVEN THINK
ABOUT WORK, I REMEMBER\\
108 - ONE THING...
I'M THE BOSS' SON.\\
109 - THEN I HEAD DOWN
TO THE NEAREST BAR\\
110 - TO CHUG BEER
AND PLAY DARTS.\\
111 - AH, BEER AND DARTS.\\
112 - KEEPING THE EYE PATCH
INDUSTRY ALIVE\\
113 - SINCE THE 1800s.\\
114 - KITTY, YOU TOLD ME WE WERE
GOING TO THE HARDWARE STORE.\\
115 - AND YOU TOLD ME I'D HAVE
A FUR COAT BY WINTER.\\
116 - PEOPLE SAY A LOT
OF THINGS.\\
117 - BUT THIS IS
NO PLACE FOR A MAN.\\
118 - IT'S 25 LADIES
AND ME.\\
119 - I THINK I LIKE MY CHANCES.\\
120 - KITTY, I GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.\\
121 - ONE OF THESE LADIES IS
LIKELY TO COME OVER HERE\\
122 - AND TRY TO TALK ME
INTO A TOUPEE.\\
123 - OK, FEZ...\\
124 - GIVE ME THE GOSSIP.\\
125 - IS THAT GLITTER
IN YOUR HAIR?\\
126 - ARE YOU MAKING
ME A PINATA?\\
127 - NO. I WAS WORKING
ON A NEW OUTFIT\\
128 - FOR ERIC TO WEAR
AT THE ROLLER DISCO.\\
129 - ROLLER DISCO? ERIC
IS INTO ROLLER DISCO?\\
130 - UH-OH.\\
131 - I'M SORRY. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO RESCHEDULE\\
132 - 'CAUSE I HAVE TO GO SPREAD
THIS EMBARRASSING NEWS.\\
133 - YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE.\\
134 - I PROMISED ERIC
I'D KEEP IT A SECRET.\\
135 - BESIDES, YOU USED TO
ROLLER DISCO WITH JACKIE.\\
136 - SURE, WHEN
I WAS A CHILD.\\
137 - BUT I'M A MAN NOW.\\
138 - I MOVED ON
TO ROBOT DANCING.\\
139 - HEY, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?\\
140 - HAVE A SEAT, STEVEN.\\
141 - IT'S COME
TO MY ATTENTION\\
142 - YOU'VE BEEN SNEAKING
OFF FROM WORK\\
143 - TO GO PLAY DARTS.\\
144 - WELL, IN MY DEFENSE,
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO DO\\
145 - TO PASS THE TIME
WHILE I'M DRINKING BEER.\\
146 - YES, ANGIE MENTIONED
THAT, TOO.\\
147 - WHAT? YOU RATTED ME OUT ON
MY MIDDAY DART-AND-BOOZE?\\
148 - WHAT? NO! I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS A FUNNY STORY.\\
149 - STEVEN, I'M SO SORRY. DADDY,
PLEASE DON'T FIRE HIM.\\
150 - YOU'RE NOT?
I'M NOT GONNA FIRE HIM.\\
151 - I MEAN... YOU'RE NOT.\\
152 - EXCELLENT CHOICE.\\
153 - STEVEN, YOU MAY BE
THE BOSS' SON,\\
154 - BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO
SHOW UP AND DO SOME WORK.\\
155 - COME ON, MAN. EVEN YOU
SAID YOURSELF IT WAS FINE\\
156 - IF I SLACK OFF
EVERY NOW AND THEN.\\
157 - LOOK, I WANT YOU TO
SUCCEED HERE, STEVEN,\\
158 - SO NO MORE DARTS.\\
159 - FINE.\\
160 - OH, BUT CAN I START
SUCCEEDING NEXT WEEK?\\
161 - SEE, THERE'S
A TOURNAMENT TOMORROW.\\
162 - I'M ALREADY SIGNED UP
AND EVERYTHING.\\
163 - THERE'S MY LITTLE
ROLLER DISCO KING.\\
164 - MOM! SHH.\\
165 - LOOK, AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT,\\
166 - THERE ARE AT LEAST
THREE KIDS IN THIS HOUSE\\
167 - WHO WOULD USE THAT
INFORMATION TO DESTROY ME.\\
168 - WE HAVE TO KEEP IT
OUR SECRET.\\
169 - WELL, I WAS JUST
READING THE BIBLE...\\
170 - AND IT SAYS THAT
KEEPING SECRETS IS A SIN.\\
171 - IT GOES LUST, GLUTTONY,
SLOTH, KEEPING SECRETS.\\
172 - MOM, WE DON'T
EVEN HAVE A BIBLE.\\
173 - REMEMBER LAST CHRISTMAS\\
174 - YOU SPILLED PEPPERMINT
SCHNAPPS ALL OVER IT?\\
175 - HONEY, JUST SHARE
YOUR SECRET.\\
176 - PEOPLE ARE GONNA
FIND OUT EVENTUALLY,\\
177 - BECAUSE THAT IS A
SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT THING\\
178 - TO KEEP SECRET.\\
179 - OK, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT ME,\\
180 - BUT I ALREADY TAKE
QUITE A BIT OF CRAP\\
181 - JUST WALKING AROUND
BEING REGULAR ME.\\
182 - SO, NO, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL ANYBODY.\\
183 - DO YOU WANT ME
TO TELL THEM?\\
184 - NO.
YES?\\
185 - NO.\\
186 - I'LL THINK ABOUT IT, OK?\\
187 - MAYBE THERE'S A WAY I CAN
KIND OF FEEL EVERYBODY OUT.\\
188 - GOOD.\\
189 - AND, BY THE WAY,\\
190 - I DID NOT SPILL
PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS\\
191 - ON THE BIBLE.\\
192 - IT WAS SAMBUCA.\\
193 - I AM NOT
TRAILER TRASH.\\
194 - I KNOW
SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW.\\
195 - FEZ, YOU KNOW A LOT
OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW,\\
196 - MOSTLY BECAUSE
THEY'RE DISGUSTING\\
197 - AND I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW THEM.\\
198 - TRUE, BUT THIS IS
ABOUT ERIC.\\
199 - WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S
DOING EVERY WEDNESDAY NIGHT\\
200 - WHEN HE'S NOT
WITH YOU?\\
201 - HE'S TAKING AN AT-HOME
SPANISH COURSE.\\
202 - HE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE DISTURBED,\\
203 - SO HE LOCKS HIMSELF
IN HIS ROOM.\\
204 - YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE'S SELF-CONSCIOUS\\
205 - BECAUSE HE CAN'T ROLL HIS Rs.\\
206 - OH, BELIEVE ME, DONNA,
HE IS RRROLLING HIS ASS OFF.\\
207 - OK, FEZ, WHAT'S GOING ON?\\
208 - IS THERE ANOTHER WOMAN?\\
209 - YES.\\
210 - AND IT'S ERIC.\\
211 - ANGIE TOTALLY
SET ME UP, MAN.\\
212 - I SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS COMING\\
213 - WHEN I FOUND OUT
SHE WAS A MATH MAJOR.\\
214 - THOSE GIRLS
ARE ALWAYS BITCHES.\\
215 - YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR
PROBLEM IS, HYDE?\\
216 - I'M TOO
GOOD-LOOKING.\\
217 - WHO DOES ANGIE THINK
SHE IS, ANYWAY?\\
218 - SHE CAN'T JUST
WALK IN HERE\\
219 - AND PULL YOUR STRINGS LIKE
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF PUPPET.\\
220 - THAT'S MY JOB.\\
221 - HEY, UH, GUYS, JUST
TO JUMP OFF TOPIC HERE\\
222 - FOR A SEC... WHEN YOU'RE
DANCING TO SAY, LIKE,\\
223 - DONNA SUMMER... WHOEVER...\\
224 - DO YOU EVER WISH
THAT YOU WERE ON WHEELS?\\
225 - FORMAN, SO MANY PARTS
OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID\\
226 - MAKE ME WANT TO KICK
YOUR ASS.\\
227 - ERIC, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?\\
228 - I'M TOO
GOOD-LOOKING.\\
229 - OK, IT'S
WEDNESDAY NIGHT,\\
230 - SO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS...\\
231 - OFF TO MY ROOM
FOR A LITTLE ESPANOL,\\
232 - OR SHOULD I SAY
OFF TO MY ROOM-O?\\
233 - YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE
SHOWING UP HERE.\\
234 - ALL RIGHT,
BACK OFF, HYDE.\\
235 - SHE'S HERE FOR ME.\\
236 - HEY, MAMA.\\
237 - HEY, SO WHAT THE HELL WAS
THAT ALL ABOUT TODAY?\\
238 - LOOK, MY DAD SAID THAT
IF I DID WELL IN COLLEGE,\\
239 - SOMEDAY THE BUSINESS
WOULD BE MINE.\\
240 - AND I DID MY PART.
SO THERE'S NO WAY\\
241 - I'M GONNA SHARE EVERYTHING
WITH SOME FRIZZY-HAIRED KID\\
242 - FRESH OUT OF JUVIE.\\
243 - OK, I'M WORKING
AT THAT COMPANY\\
244 - BECAUSE OUR DAD
WANTS ME THERE.\\
245 - AND DON'T INSULT ME
WITH THAT JUVIE CRAP.\\
246 - I'M OVER 18.\\
247 - IF I GET PINCHED,
I'M DOING BIG BOY TIME.\\
248 - RUNNING THIS COMPANY
IS MY DREAM,\\
249 - SO IF YOU DON'T
QUIT TOMORROW,\\
250 - IT'S GONNA BE WAR.\\
251 - HE'S YOUR FRIEND. TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HIM.\\
252 - IF YOU WANTED
MY HELP,\\
253 - YOU SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT MORE CUPCAKES.\\
254 - FEZ, COME ON.\\
255 - JUST TELL US
WHAT ERIC'S UP TO.\\
256 - DONNA, IF I LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM ALL MY YEARS AS A VIRGIN...\\
257 - IT'S THAT SEEING IT\\
258 - IS MUCH BETTER
THAN TALKING ABOUT IT.\\
259 - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!\\
260 - THAT, DONNA,\\
261 - THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR BOYFRIEND.\\
262 - SO, STEVEN, WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO ABOUT ANGIE?\\
263 - HOW ARE YOU GONNA
FIGHT BACK?\\
264 - I DON'T KNOW
THAT I AM.\\
265 - I MEAN, YOU'RE ASKING
ME TO FIGHT FOR A JOB.\\
266 - THAT'S A TOUGH
SELL.\\
267 - BUT THIS IS
MY COMPANY AT STAKE.\\
268 - JACKIE, WOULD
YOU STOP SAYING\\
269 - THAT EVERYTHING
THAT'S MINE IS YOURS?\\
270 - OK, STEVEN, LAST VALENTINE'S
DAY, I GAVE YOU A CARD\\
271 - THAT SAID "BE MINE,"
AND YOU SAID YES.\\
272 - AND BY SAYING YES, YOU AGREED
THAT EVERYTHING YOU HAD,\\
273 - HAVE, OR WILL HAVE FROM
NOW UNTIL THE END OF TIME\\
274 - IS MINE AS WELL.\\
275 - READ THE FINE PRINT,
STEVEN.\\
276 - THIS WHOLE WORK THING
IS A MESS.\\
277 - I MISS MY GLORY DAYS
OF BEING AN ORPHAN.\\
278 - A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE
ABOUT HAVING A FAMILY...\\
279 - GET USED TO BEING
SCREWED OVER.\\
280 - WELL, THAT'S A VERY
CYNICAL VIEW OF FAMILY.\\
281 - OH, YEAH, AND YOU AND YOUR
SISTER GET ALONG SO WELL.\\
282 - OH, I TALKED TO A LAWYER.\\
283 - SHE'S NOT GETTING
A DAMN THING.\\
284 - RED, WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.\\
285 - IT'S PRETTY SHOCKING.\\
286 - I'M NOT SURE HOW
TO BREAK IT TO YOU.\\
287 - OK, YOU BETTER
LET ME HANDLE THIS.\\
288 - ALL RIGHT.
EVERYBODY WHOSE SON\\
289 - IS NOT A ROLLER DISCO-ER,
TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD.\\
290 - NOT SO FAST, RED!\\
291 - SOMEONE'S BEEN WORKING
ON THEIR SPIN, SUSIE.\\
292 - NICE. VERY NICE.\\
293 - IT'S MAGIC TIME.\\
294 - HEY, EVERYBODY, LET'S GIVE A
GREAT BIG ROLLER PALACE WELCOME\\
295 - TO THE ONE,
THE ONLY, RAINBOW!\\
296 - NO!\\
297 - NICE SHORTS, RAINBOW.\\
298 - HEY. DID YOU COME UP
TO PACK UP YOUR OFFICE?\\
299 - LISTEN, SIS, ABOUT
THE WHOLE JOB THING,\\
300 - I THOUGHT ABOUT GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH YOU,\\
301 - BUT I DECIDED I JUST
CAN'T STOOP TO YOUR LEVEL.\\
302 - WELL, GOOD.\\
303 - BUT SHE CAN.\\
304 - RIGHT NOW SHE'S TELLING
EVERYBODY WE WORK WITH\\
305 - THAT YOU STRIPPED YOUR
WAY THROUGH COLLEGE.\\
306 - PLEASE. LIKE ANYBODY'S
GONNA BELIEVE HER.\\
307 - MY DAD'S RICH.\\
308 - OH, NO, NO, NO.\\
309 - YOU DIDN'T STRIP BECAUSE
YOU NEEDED THE MONEY.\\
310 - WORD AROUND
THE WATER COOLER IS...\\
311 - YOU STRIPPED BECAUSE
YOU LIKED IT.\\
312 - Jackie: I KNOW, I KNOW!
WHAT A WHORE. WHOO!\\
313 - STOP LAUGHING AT ME.\\
314 - I AM NOT A STRIPPER.
I AM A MATH MAJOR.\\
315 - HA HA!\\
316 - JACKIE, IF THERE WAS
EVER A GAME SHOW\\
317 - CALLED "MAKE THAT GIRL CRY,"\\
318 - I'D GO ON WITH YOU.\\
319 - OH, WE'D SO WIN
THE CAR.\\
320 - ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY
CLEAR SOME SPACE.\\
321 - IT'S RAINBOW!\\
322 - NOW, LOOK, ERIC,
THEY LOVE YOU,\\
323 - SO IT'S A GOOD THING
I TOLD FEZ.\\
324 - I DIDN'T TELL YOU
I TOLD FEZ.\\
325 - I DIDN'T TELL FEZ.\\
326 - ERIC,
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?\\
327 - I MEAN, YOU DON'T JUST
WAKE UP ONE MORNING,\\
328 - THROW ON SOME SKATES,\\
329 - AND START DOING CARTWHEELS
TO SISTER SLEDGE.\\
330 - IT ALL STARTED\\
331 - WHEN I WENT DOWN TO
THE SPORTING GOODS STORE.\\
332 - I SAW THIS PAIR
OF ROLLER SKATES,\\
333 - AND WHEN I TRIED
THEM ON,\\
334 - WELL, IT WAS LIKE THE
FIRST TIME JOE NAMATH\\
335 - LAID HIS HANDS ON A BAT.\\
336 - THE NEXT THING I CAN
REMEMBER IS SPINNING...\\
337 - JUST SPINNING AND
SPINNING AND SPINNING.\\
338 - WHEN I FINALLY STOPPED, I
FOUND MYSELF AT THE PARK.\\
339 - THAT'S WHERE I MET
UP WITH THESE PEOPLE.\\
340 - WAIT. THOSE SKATE FREAKS
THAT HANG OUT\\
341 - DOWN BY
THE BASKETBALL COURT?\\
342 - EVERY TIME WE
WANT TO SHOOT HOOPS,\\
343 - WE GOT TO SCARE THEM OFF
WITH BOTTLE ROCKETS.\\
344 - KELSO, THEY'RE
NOT FREAKS.\\
345 - THEY'RE JUST LIKE YOU
AND ME, BUT ON WHEELS.\\
346 - ERIC, LET ME TELL
YOU A LITTLE STORY.\\
347 - WHEN I WAS A BOY, THERE
WAS A KID WHO WANTED TO BE\\
348 - A BALLET DANCER,\\
349 - AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS
MADE FUN OF HIM.\\
350 - BUT YEARS LATER,
WHEN HE CAME BACK TO TOWN,\\
351 - HE HAD ACHIEVED
HIS DREAM.\\
352 - HE WAS A DANCER WITH
THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET.\\
353 - AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?\\
354 - YOU LEARNED YOUR LITTLE LESSON
ABOUT JUDGING PEOPLE UNFAIRLY, HUH?\\
355 - NO. A BUNCH OF GUYS
GOT TOGETHER\\
356 - AND BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF HIM.\\
357 - HEY, RED, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?\\
358 - I'M TOO GOOD-LOOKING.\\
359 - OK, DAD, I HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,\\
360 - BUT... I HONESTLY DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN GIVE IT UP.\\
361 - WHY DON'T YOU
TRY SOMETHING ELSE?\\
362 - I SUGGEST ROBOT DANCING.\\
363 - FEEL
THE BEAT. DISCO ROBOT.\\
364 - DADDY, I CAN'T
WORK WITH HIM.\\
365 - HE'S TELLING LIES
ABOUT ME.\\
366 - ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.\\
367 - SHE'S TELLING THEM.\\
368 - STEVEN, WHY IS THAT
GIRL ALWAYS IN THE OFFICE?\\
369 - AND WHY HAS SHE BEEN
PASSING OUT DRESS CODE MEMOS\\
370 - TO MY EMPLOYEES?\\
371 - UM, WELL, SHE'S AGAINST THE
CASUALIZATION OF THE WORKPLACE.\\
372 - SHE DOESN'T BELONG HERE
AND NEITHER DOES HE.\\
373 - I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M SEEING...\\
374 - A BROTHER AND SISTER
FIGHTING EACH OTHER.\\
375 - HEY,
WE ARE FAMILY.\\
376 - LOOK, IF YOU WANT HIM
TO STAY, THAT'S FINE,\\
377 - BUT IF HE STAYS,
I'M OUT OF HERE.\\
378 - WELL, THAT'S
TOO BAD,\\
379 - BECAUSE I'M OPENING
UP A NEW RECORD STORE\\
380 - AND I WANTED THE
TWO OF YOU TO RUN IT.\\
381 - BUT MAYBE I'LL JUST LET
STEVEN RUN IT BY HIMSELF.\\
382 - HELL, YEAH!\\
383 - NICE GOING, SIS.\\
384 - NO. YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED MY OWN STORE.\\
385 - WELL, IF YOU TWO CAN'T FIND
A WAY TO WORK THIS OUT...\\
386 - WE CAN. I KNOW WE CAN.\\
387 - HE'S MY BROTHER.\\
388 - I TRY TO GET HIM FIRED,
HE CALLS ME A STRIPPER.\\
389 - THIS IS HOW WE PLAY.\\
390 - WELL, I'M GLAD, BECAUSE
IF THIS KEPT GOING,\\
391 - I WOULD HAVE HAD TO
SEND THE TWO OF YOU\\
392 - TO YOUR OFFICES
WITHOUT ANY DINNER.\\
393 - THAT'S A DAD JOKE.
I LOVE IT.\\
394 - SO, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO PUT UP WITH ME AFTER ALL.\\
395 - HEY, I SAID
I'D WORK WITH YOU.\\
396 - IT DOESN'T MEAN
I LIKE YOU.\\
397 - YOUR NOT LIKING ME DOESN'T
BOTHER ME THAT MUCH NOW THAT I WON.\\
398 - AND BY "I WON,"
I MEAN YOU LOST.\\
399 - OH. AND ALSO...\\
400 - YOU KNOW, HERE I'M
JUST AN AVERAGE KID.\\
401 - BUT DOWN THERE...\\
402 - DOWN THERE,
I WAS A STAR.\\
403 - WHAT?\\
404 - OH, DID I MAKE THE KISSY
FACE TOO EARLY AGAIN?\\
405 - NO, NO. IT'S NOTHING.\\
406 - WHAT?\\
407 - WHY DO YOU KEEP
LAUGHING AT ME?\\
408 - I'M GONNA GO HOME
AND I'M GONNA WATCH\\
409 - A REALLY SAD MOVIE\\
410 - AND I'M GONNA TRY
TO COME BACK LATER.
\subsection {Episode 09: You Can't Always Get What You Want}
1 - Man, I can't believe
Thanksgiving's tomorrow.\\
2 - It's that special time of
year, I like to give thanks,\\
3 - get Fez drunk and dress him up
like a lady pilgrim.\\
4 - Well, the joke's on you
because this year,\\
5 - I'm getting into the dress
before I get drunk.\\
6 - Ah, touche.\\
7 - Well, so long as it happens.\\
8 - I had Thanksgiving dinner last
night with Brooke and the baby\\
9 - so I could be here tonight
for Fez and the dress.\\
10 - Hey, guys, I got something really
different planned for Thanksgiving.\\
11 - But instead of telling you about
it, I'm gonna let it wash over you.\\
12 - But, Eric, maybe you can let
some soap and water wash over you.\\
13 - 'Cause since you've been out
of work, you're a little bummy.\\
14 - Welcome to
the grand illusion\\
15 - Come on in
and see what's happening\\
16 - Pay the price\\
17 - Get your tickets
for the show\\
18 - Is that Styx?\\
19 - And they just announced
a concert Thanksgiving night.\\
20 - Now, if we camp out for tickets,\\
21 - by tomorrow we could be
watching five guys in spandex suits\\
22 - shaking their hair sweat
on teenage girls.\\
23 - Forman, even if I liked Styx,\\
24 - which would mean
I was born without ears,\\
25 - I still can't go.\\
26 - My dad wants me and Angie to open
the record store by midnight tomorrow.\\
27 - Oh, man, Angie is so pretty.\\
28 - You know, looking at Angie
is like looking at\\
29 - something else pretty.\\
30 - Well said.\\
31 - Donna, you in for Styx?\\
32 - Eric, I'm a deejay. I can't
be seen at a Styx concert.\\
33 - It's in my contract.\\
34 - Well, Fez, what do you say,
my man from another land?\\
35 - Eric, where I come from,
we have a saying.\\
36 - Yuck, Styx.\\
37 - Remember, kids, music is joy,
comfort, a Band-Aid for a wounded soul.\\
38 - And if you get people to believe that
crap, you're gonna sell a lot of records.\\
39 - - Here are the keys
to the store.
- Thank you.\\
40 - I just figure whoever hasn't been
in prison should hold the keys.\\
41 - I thought you'd do that, so
I made an extra set for you.\\
42 - - Everybody gets keys.
- Thank you.\\
43 - Yeah, you don't know me
very well,\\
44 - but you're gonna have to make
three of everything.\\
45 - I'm starting to get you
a little bit. You're funny.\\
46 - All right, well, as co-manager
of this record store,\\
47 - my first order is\\
48 - a pizza.\\
49 - Are you crazy?\\
50 - We have to start
unloading records.\\
51 - Hey, look, I don't know
about these other jokers,\\
52 - but I am here to help.\\
53 - So if you need to get anything
off of one of these high shelves,\\
54 - I'll be happy to
watch you reach for it.\\
55 - All right, guys, we got a ton of
boxes to unpack, posters to hang.\\
56 - So let's hit it.\\
57 - I love hitting it.\\
58 - I love that you taught me
to love hitting it.\\
59 - You know, this is the first
time we've ever hit it at...\\
60 - Hey, this place
doesn't have a name yet.\\
61 - You should call it Hot Wax
Records but with a "Z." Recordz.\\
62 - Z's are so rock 'n' roll.\\
63 - Funk Man's House of Funk.\\
64 - Funk Man's Funky House of Funk.\\
65 - Funky Man's Funky
House of Hitting It.\\
66 - You guys writing
this down or what?\\
67 - Steven, that's too complicated.\\
68 - You need something
that sounds hot and upscale.\\
69 - You should call it Jackie.\\
70 - If you wanted hot and upscale,
you should call it Dijon Mustard.\\
71 - What about, like, Head Food?\\
72 - Headsies, The Head.\\
73 - That's kind of cool. The Head.\\
74 - - The Head.
- The Head.\\
75 - The Head.\\
76 - I smell something burning.\\
77 - That'd be us.\\
78 - Oh, man, we just came up with
the best name for the record store.\\
79 - It's, um...\\
80 - The Funky Mustard House.\\
81 - I thought we settled on Jackie.\\
82 - I just had it and then
it popped out of my head.\\
83 - That's it. Poppers.\\
84 - This is a chain. All the
stores are called Grooves.\\
85 - Oh, that's why
we have that sign.\\
86 - All right, well, let's call it a day
and hit it hard again tomorrow.\\
87 - Good work, everyone.\\
88 - Oh, wait, I just remembered
the name. Lumpy's.\\
89 - No, it wasn't called Lumpy's.\\
90 - Well, my store is
gonna be called Lumpy's.\\
91 - Hanging out\\
92 - Down the street\\
93 - The same old thing\\
94 - We did last week\\
95 - Not a thing to do\\
96 - But talk to you\\
97 - We're all all right\\
98 - We're all all right\\
99 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
100 - First one here.\\
101 - Hey, you guys getting in line
for Styx tickets, too?\\
102 - Yeah, right.\\
103 - If we weren't late for this
party, we'd kick your ass.\\
104 - Styx rules.\\
105 - - What was that, dork?
- I said enjoy your party.\\
106 - Oh, my God!\\
107 - Did I miss it?
Are there any tickets left?\\
108 - Black Sabbath's been
sold out for weeks.\\
109 - No. Styx.\\
110 - I prefer a more lush,
orchestral sound.\\
111 - Yeah, well, you're the only one.\\
112 - Just give me the damn ticket.\\
113 - Man, Hyde, this listening pit
is an awesome idea.\\
114 - Yeah. You made a place for
people to hang out, listen to music,\\
115 - and feel up Angie and stuff.\\
116 - That's not what
this pit is for, man.\\
117 - It's for listening to records
and feeling up Jackie and stuff.\\
118 - Steven's so innovative.\\
119 - You know, he designed
this whole thing from scratch.\\
120 - Um...\\
121 - This is exactly Eric's basement.\\
122 - Oh, you're just jealous because
Steven's successful and Eric's all bummy.\\
123 - What is all this?\\
124 - What happened to
the Soft Rock section?\\
125 - I put it in the alley.\\
126 - See, that way, if somebody
comes in asking for Barry Manilow,\\
127 - I can send him outside
and lock the door.\\
128 - Steven, this store is
very important to me.\\
129 - When I was eight years old,\\
130 - Santa asked me what I wanted for
Christmas and I said, "A record store."\\
131 - You know what I got? A pony.\\
132 - What eight-year-old girl
wants a damn pony?\\
133 - You know, one year I asked
for a damn pony and got a car.\\
134 - I just want this store
to be great.\\
135 - Yeah, well, I think this pit
makes the store great.\\
136 - Really? Did you go
to business school?\\
137 - Well, he did a lot
of business at school.\\
138 - Fine, I'll get rid of the pit,\\
139 - but I want that entire wall
covered in Zeppelin.\\
140 - We can't.\\
141 - You know that research paper that I
gave you that you probably smoked?\\
142 - Well, it says that Zeppelin
scares people over 30.\\
143 - Good, because people over 30
don't listen to music.\\
144 - They move to Florida
to play golf.\\
145 - Man, Angie is so
awesome and classy.\\
146 - She's like the first page
of a Playboy layout.\\
147 - You know,
before you see her cans.\\
148 - Did you know that all that stuff
about those girls is made up?\\
149 - Yeah, they're not really librarians
or horse trainers or scientists.\\
150 - They're just whores.\\
151 - I wish someone would rub
my shoulders like this.\\
152 - Hey.\\
153 - Whatcha cooking, good-looking?\\
154 - Guess who got a ticket to
see Styx in concert tonight?\\
155 - Tonight?
Honey, it's Thanksgiving.\\
156 - Yeah, but this is
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.\\
157 - Mom, this ticket was
really hard to get.\\
158 - Was it harder to get
than the holiday traditions\\
159 - this family has built through
decades of love and sacrifice?\\
160 - Much harder.
Thanks for understanding.\\
161 - There's my beautiful bride.
I'll be in the garage.\\
162 - Red.\\
163 - None of the kids
are coming for dinner tonight.\\
164 - Laurie's in Canada,
Steven has his store,\\
165 - and now Eric is
going to a concert.\\
166 - There's no point in me
even making my special yams.\\
167 - What?\\
168 - Kitty, I love those yams.\\
169 - They're among the top three
reasons I married you.\\
170 - Well, I can't make them
if I'm sad.\\
171 - Look, I'll tell you what,\\
172 - you get started on the yams
and I'll go talk to Eric.\\
173 - Thanks.\\
174 - Gosh, my shoulders are sore
from all this cooking.\\
175 - Think you could
rub them a little?\\
176 - Kitty, it's Thanksgiving,
not Christmas.\\
177 - Styx, Kelso?\\
178 - All right, fine.
I like Styx, okay?\\
179 - And I don't care
if anybody knows it.\\
180 - That's not true.
Don't tell anyone.\\
181 - Why aren't you putting
the records in the bins?\\
182 - - What bins?
- The ones I ordered.\\
183 - Oh, my God.
I never ordered the bins.\\
184 - Hmm!\\
185 - That would never happen
at Jackie.\\
186 - What are we gonna do?\\
187 - There's no bins.\\
188 - No bins!\\
189 - Hey, look, man, I'll
take care of it, all right?\\
190 - But it's gonna cost you.\\
191 - Listening pit comes back,
Zeppelin goes up on that wall,\\
192 - and I want you to remove the
smoke detectors from the back office.\\
193 - Whatever you want.\\
194 - Oh, and also, my creepy friend
gets to hold your hand for two minutes.\\
195 - That would be me.\\
196 - Wait, all right, back off.\\
197 - I want to be the first one
of us who gets to touch her.\\
198 - You, too, with the Styx?\\
199 - That's a present
for my friend,\\
200 - Fez. Damn it.\\
201 - Out of my way, Dad.
Time for me to rock.\\
202 - You're not going to the concert.\\
203 - What? Why not?\\
204 - Look, every family has
its holiday traditions.\\
205 - Some sing, others play charades.\\
206 - In our family,
someone always cries.\\
207 - But I'll be damned if it's gonna
be your mother crying tonight.\\
208 - I can't see her like that.\\
209 - I love her.\\
210 - She threatened
not to make the yams.\\
211 - Just get the hell back
in the house.\\
212 - Okay, here's the situation.\\
213 - It's Thanksgiving night.
Everything's closed.\\
214 - We need to find
100 record bins by midnight.\\
215 - It's the same damn thing,
every year.\\
216 - Wait, I have a question.\\
217 - How does hair know to grow?\\
218 - And how far inside
your head does it go?\\
219 - Does it touch your brain?\\
220 - Okay, I think we need to get
Jerry Garcia here some coffee.\\
221 - Let the girl rap, I was into it.\\
222 - I like to think about my head.\\
223 - The Head, that's the name.
I saved the day.\\
224 - You know what would be perfect
for the records?\\
225 - Those boxes
that milk bottles come in.\\
226 - They're like crates or crepes.\\
227 - Crepes. How good are crepes?\\
228 - That'll work, man. We need,
like, 50 empty milk crates.\\
229 - Well, how are we
gonna drink all that milk?\\
230 - Wait.
We need 50 boxes of cookies.\\
231 - No, wastoid.
We'll steal the crates.\\
232 - It's perfect.\\
233 - Milk crates.\\
234 - Milk crates.\\
235 - Milk crates.\\
236 - Milky Craties.\\
237 - Okay. My Valium's
starting to wear off.\\
238 - What's happening
with those boxes?\\
239 - Man, we just thought of
the perfect solution.\\
240 - We're gonna go
get some of those...\\
241 - - The Head.
- Crepes.\\
242 - Poppers.\\
243 - Whatever. We'll be back.\\
244 - Why is it every time I leave
the room, you guys do this?\\
245 - It's Thanksgiving.\\
246 - Some people bake pies,
we bake ourselves.\\
247 - Thank you for opening up your
home to me on this special day.\\
248 - This family is all about love.\\
249 - Yep, spirit-crushing
tyrannical love.\\
250 - Drop that tone of voice,\\
251 - you'll be wearing that turkey
like a football helmet.\\
252 - Okay, now, everybody take a
feather from the paper turkey\\
253 - and write down something
you're thankful for,\\
254 - and then we'll all pick feathers
and guess who wrote them.\\
255 - Any questions?\\
256 - This is kind of off-topic,
but where can I put my belt?\\
257 - I'll go first.\\
258 - "I'm thankful for my mother/wife.
My life is meaningless without her."\\
259 - Whoopsie, I got mine.\\
260 - It would've sounded better
if someone else had read it.\\
261 - "I'm thankful you have pecan
pie. You do have pecan pie, right?\\
262 - "Because I turned down an
invitation that involved pecan pie."\\
263 - Hmm, Bob?\\
264 - "I'm thankful I didn't waste
my day at a really fun concert.\\
265 - "This way I can work on
becoming a bitter, old man\\
266 - "whose only happiness
is destroying his son's life."\\
267 - Kitty, hand me the turkey.\\
268 - I think I got Red's.\\
269 - 'Cause the only words I
can repeat are "Eric, little"\\
270 - and a word that
starts with "mother."\\
271 - "Mother"? That's nice.\\
272 - It takes
a pretty hard left turn.\\
273 - Thanksgiving is ruined.\\
274 - Don't look at me. Dad's the
one who cursed on a turkey.\\
275 - Kitty.
Bob, touch my yams and die.\\
276 - Look at all the stuff
I gotta eat.\\
277 - Okay, look, I'll distract him.
Jackie, give me your lipstick.\\
278 - Okay, but you picked a really
weird time to get into makeup, Donna.\\
279 - I love it when you whore
yourself for the good of the group.\\
280 - Hey, you.\\
281 - That's, um... That's a sexy
milk truck you got there.\\
282 - Really? Nah.\\
283 - Oh, yeah, that big cow
on the side is really sexy.\\
284 - I haven't talked to a woman
in four months.\\
285 - Oh, come here, big guy.\\
286 - She's hugging him.\\
287 - Okay, come on. Let's
grab everything. Hurry up.\\
288 - Or slow down. I'd like
to see where this goes.\\
289 - How could you think it would
be okay to miss Thanksgiving?\\
290 - You might as well
just rip my heart out\\
291 - and drown it in my
delicious giblet gravy.\\
292 - It's not just Thanksgiving.\\
293 - You used to have
goals and ambition.\\
294 - But now, one week
you're chasing butterflies,\\
295 - the next week you're skating around
the neighborhood dressed like Liberace.\\
296 - Did it ever occur to you guys
that I don't know what I'm doing?\\
297 - Okay? I'm scared.\\
298 - Of what, honey?\\
299 - We got rid of the spooky lamp
in your room.\\
300 - Look, my whole life, I've been
trying to please other people.\\
301 - So I feel like I don't know who I am
or know what I want to do with my life.\\
302 - You need a government job,
like a mailman.\\
303 - Something simple and repetitive.\\
304 - No, no, no. You know
he doesn't do well in snow.\\
305 - What about this?\\
306 - Margie's son is a chiropractor,
and she seems very happy.\\
307 - I just...\\
308 - I don't wanna wake up in
five years and hate my life.\\
309 - That's unavoidable.\\
310 - Okay, I just need
more time to think.\\
311 - You know what I got
for my 18th birthday?\\
312 - A draft notice and
a malaria vaccine.\\
313 - I never had time to think.\\
314 - Yeah, but, Dad, don't you think it
would've been helpful if you did?\\
315 - All right, I'll tell you what.\\
316 - I'll give you six months.\\
317 - But if you haven't
picked something by then,\\
318 - you'll do that chiropractic thing
that your mother suggested.\\
319 - Dad, I... I don't
even know what that is.\\
320 - Oh, honey, it's perfect for you.\\
321 - It's like a doctor but you
don't have to be as smart.\\
322 - I can't believe I had
to kiss that milkman.\\
323 - Donna, you've done
worse for less.\\
324 - Shut up.\\
325 - - Was it milky?
- Shut up.\\
326 - So, what do you think?\\
327 - I think I see a lot of
records in milk crates.\\
328 - Where are the bins
like the other stores have?\\
329 - - Dad, I forgot to tell you...
- Forgot to tell me what?\\
330 - Uh, what she forgot to tell
you was that it was my idea.\\
331 - See, I thought it'd look cool, you
know, like we stole them or something.\\
332 - Well, I don't much like it,
but we'll give it a shot.\\
333 - Why is Jackie
behind the cash register?\\
334 - Hey, funny girl,
get your hands off my money.\\
335 - - That was really nice of you.
- I know, and now you owe me.\\
336 - I want black lights,
bigger speakers\\
337 - and a little thing called
the five-day weekend.\\
338 - Hey, was Hyde being mean to you?\\
339 - You know, I can't beat him up
for you. But I can get Donna to.\\
340 - No, he was great.\\
341 - It's just, I've been waiting
for this day my whole life\\
342 - and now I don't know.\\
343 - I don't know what
to do with myself.\\
344 - Well, I think that you need
to take some time for you,\\
345 - and may I suggest an
evening out with Michael Kelso.\\
346 - Dinner, drinks
and a ride home not included.\\
347 - I never did have
a Thanksgiving dinner.\\
348 - I can buy you a taco.\\
349 - Oh, and then we can celebrate,
like the original Thanksgiving,\\
350 - with the pilgrims
and the Mexicans.\\
351 - Welcome to
the grand illusion\\
352 - Come on in and
see what's happening\\
353 - Check it out.
Jackie's rocking out to Styx.\\
354 - So? Fez was
mouthing the words.\\
355 - Uh... I thought it was okay now
because Hyde was tapping his foot.\\
356 - Whoa, whoa.
I was just squashing a bug.\\
357 - How about you, Donna? You've
been kind of quiet. Are you okay?\\
358 - I kissed the milkman.\\
359 - Happy Thanksgiving, Forman.
\subsection {Episode 10: Surprise, Surprise}
1 - I think we have a really
big shoplifting problem.\\
2 - I just did inventory and
there are 30 records missing.\\
3 - Oh, Angie, I forgot to tell you,\\
4 - I moved those to the annexe,\\
5 - otherwise known as my house.\\
6 - Excuse me, Mr. Record Store
Big Shot, I need some help.\\
7 - Where can I find something
by Bette Midler?\\
8 - Well, we don't
have any Bette Midler,\\
9 - but may I suggest
something even better?\\
10 - Perhaps a little Sex Pistols?\\
11 - Sex Pistols?
Well, that's terrible.\\
12 - Guns don't belong
in the bedroom.\\
13 - They agree, and a lot of
their songs are about just that.\\
14 - And they deliver their message
with a smooth, mellow sound.\\
15 - So it's like easy listening.\\
16 - Well, they're not hard to hear.\\
17 - Steven, the store is great.\\
18 - I'm proud of you.
Thank you.\\
19 - Whoa, Hyde, I want you
to really savor this moment.\\
20 - Red's only nice
every 75 years. Yeah.\\
21 - He's kind of like the Halley's
Comet of compliments.\\
22 - I got one the first time
I used the potty and...\\
23 - Yeah, since then, nothing.\\
24 - What am I supposed to do?\\
25 - Compliment you every
time you go to the can?\\
26 - See?\\
27 - All these kids, wasting
their money on records.\\
28 - You'd think they could be down
at my muffler shop buying mufflers.\\
29 - You're all stupid.\\
30 - If you want, I could plug your
store on my next radio show.\\
31 - That'd be great, and tell
them I'm giving away calendars.\\
32 - Okay. Well,
the only problem is\\
33 - I don't know how many
people will hear it.\\
34 - I used to think I
had a lot of listeners\\
35 - 'cause I had a lot of call-ins.\\
36 - But it turns out it was just one
crazy guy doing different voices.\\
37 - You may know him as Fez.\\
38 - Fez, just tell me your secret.\\
39 - Just kiss me.\\
40 - I'm not doing that.\\
41 - Then I'm not
telling you my secret.\\
42 - Just tell me.
Just kiss me.\\
43 - Ugh!\\
44 - Big news from the salon,\\
45 - I just shampooed Marie, who
waits tables at the coffee shop.\\
46 - Well, that is big news.\\
47 - She served pie at 1:00 a.m. to
Kelso and Hyde's sister, Angie.\\
48 - And Kelso took the pie and
fed it to Angie, and she liked it.\\
49 - Oh, my God.\\
50 - This isn't good. Steven
is gonna lose his mind.\\
51 - I can't believe Angie
went out with Kelso.\\
52 - What? Angie went out
with Kelso?\\
53 - What?\\
54 - Don't you "what" me,
you know what you did.\\
55 - It was $10, I'll put
it back in the register.\\
56 - No, not that.
You went out with Kelso.\\
57 - Look, in my town
there are two rules.\\
58 - One, don't date Kelso.
Two, don't date Kelso.\\
59 - Yeah, it even says that on the
sign when you drive into town.\\
60 - "Welcome to Point Place.
Don't date Kelso."\\
61 - The high school band
spells that out during half time.\\
62 - Look, I'm not dating Michael.\\
63 - We went out one time, but
it's not gonna happen again.\\
64 - I need a guy who
can eat a breadstick\\
65 - without pretending
it's a cigar first.\\
66 - Okay, the thing is, Angie,
Michael's like chocolate cake, okay?\\
67 - It looks good in the bakery,\\
68 - but when you take it home,
it sleeps with all your friends.\\
69 - Yeah.\\
70 - Hey, Donna,
what kind of food am I?\\
71 - I don't know,
I guess, a Twizzler.\\
72 - What?
No, it's a good thing.\\
73 - You can have a lot of them
and not even notice.\\
74 - You're just gonna sit
there and take that?\\
75 - Of course you are.
You're a Twizzler.\\
76 - Are you closed yet or what?\\
77 - I've been waiting in the
parking lot for, like, forever.\\
78 - I didn't see you out there.\\
79 - That's 'cause I was hiding
in the bushes by your car.\\
80 - I figured when I jumped out,\\
81 - you'd be so relieved it was me
that you'd go out with me again.\\
82 - Why didn't you just ask me out?\\
83 - I don't know.\\
84 - I was gonna but you're so
pretty and successful and...\\
85 - Plus, I kind of like
hiding in the bushes.\\
86 - Michael, I appreciate the offer,\\
87 - but I'm not sure you're my type.\\
88 - "Not your type"? I'm like
ketchup, I go good on everything.\\
89 - Yeah, well, thanks anyways.\\
90 - Okay, all right.
Look, Angie,\\
91 - I really want to go out
with you again, okay?\\
92 - And I got about 50 lines that
I could throw at you right now,\\
93 - but I don't
wanna do that because\\
94 - I don't want you
to go out with me\\
95 - because of some line.\\
96 - I want you to go
out with me 'cause\\
97 - you like me as
much as I like you.\\
98 - Are you telling me
that's not a line?\\
99 - Well, it's not now, but if it
works, I can add it to the list.\\
100 - Okay, you know what?\\
101 - Let's go get a drink,
but just one drink.\\
102 - Ready for that drink now?\\
103 - Hanging out\\
104 - Down the street\\
105 - The same old thing\\
106 - We did last week\\
107 - Not a thing to do\\
108 - But talk to you\\
109 - We're all all right\\
110 - We're all all right\\
111 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
112 - You know, I'm not sure
these Sex Pistols are for me.\\
113 - Look, this fella's
name is Johnny Rotten.\\
114 - You'd think he'd change
that for show business.\\
115 - Mrs. Forman?\\
116 - Okay, Steven just found out
Michael went out with his sister,\\
117 - so I need to think of
something to do to cheer him up.\\
118 - Well, I do know Steven loves
peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.\\
119 - So I go buy those?\\
120 - No, Jackie, you make them.\\
121 - So I hire someone to make them?\\
122 - No, you have to make them
with your own two hands.\\
123 - I'll pay you $20 to make them.\\
124 - Only you can put in the love,\\
125 - that is the real
secret ingredient.\\
126 - $30.\\
127 - Will you two hens stop clucking?\\
128 - Donna's back on the radio.\\
129 - Okay, that was
the Thursday rock block\\
130 - and you're listening to the
new and improved Hot Donna.\\
131 - Now with hair
like strands of gold.\\
132 - And if you're driving home
and things are a little loud,\\
133 - stop by the Forman
& Son muffler shop,\\
134 - where they're also
giving away calendars.\\
135 - She said "Forman" on the radio.\\
136 - We're gonna have to change
our phone number.\\
137 - You know,
that Donna is a great girl.\\
138 - I can't believe
that Eric wouldn't marry her.\\
139 - When I get back home,
I'm gonna kick him in the ass.\\
140 - And now, Love You
Inside Out by the Bee Gees,\\
141 - going out to Jackie Burkhart
from Steven Hyde.\\
142 - Oh, see now, Steven loves me
and wants everyone to know it.\\
143 - Requested by Jackie Burkhart.\\
144 - Okay, Fez, I'll play
you one more game.\\
145 - But just so you know,
this "honk, honk" is a foul.\\
146 - Hey, guys.
Hey, Angie.\\
147 - I need to talk to you
guys about something.\\
148 - Oh, God, you didn't go out
with Kelso again, did you?\\
149 - No, I was on my way
to going out with him\\
150 - but then we got interrupted
by me sleeping with him.\\
151 - What?\\
152 - Well, at least they didn't
go out. Wait a minute.\\
153 - I need some advice.\\
154 - My advice is, go back in time
and don't sleep with Kelso.\\
155 - Yeah, but you need
a time machine.\\
156 - The only person
working on that is Kelso.\\
157 - He says if you want to use it,
you have to sleep with him.\\
158 - So you're kind of
back where you started.\\
159 - Here's the thing.\\
160 - I don't know if you guys have
noticed, but I'm kind of, you know...\\
161 - Bitchy?\\
162 - I was gonna say
"uptight," but fine.\\
163 - I never relax and laugh, and
with Michael that's all we do.\\
164 - Except for the sex.\\
165 - Although I did laugh,
you know, during.\\
166 - Actually, it was more of
a giggle of appreciation.\\
167 - Okay. I'm not sure you know
what you're getting yourself into.\\
168 - Kelso has a baby
with another woman.\\
169 - Yeah, he told me.\\
170 - Damn.\\
171 - I thought that would
run you off for sure.\\
172 - Let me try. I'm the
master at running girls off.\\
173 - You think he's good in bed, huh?\\
174 - How do you think
he got that good?\\
175 - Practice, practice, practice.\\
176 - Cheerleader, cheerleader,
cheerleader's mother.\\
177 - Hey, Fez, check out
this nudie calendar.\\
178 - Uh-oh.\\
179 - Is this the calendar
Red's giving away?\\
180 - It's just pictures of
half-naked girls posing by cars.\\
181 - That's a disgrace.\\
182 - I'll dispose of that.\\
183 - No, I'll take it.\\
184 - We'll never get it back now.\\
185 - It's going in the box
with my "naked lady" pen,\\
186 - and my "I Got Crabs
in Louisiana" T-shirt.\\
187 - Thank you for
helping me, Mrs. Forman.\\
188 - Steven is gonna
love these cookies.\\
189 - Okay, now start by cracking
a couple of eggs into the bowl.\\
190 - I can't touch an egg.\\
191 - Why not?\\
192 - 'Cause it came out
of a chicken butt.\\
193 - Honey, they wash it.\\
194 - Well, wash it all you want,
it still came out of a butt.\\
195 - All right, so I've been thinking
about Donna's "Twizzler" remark.\\
196 - Maybe it's not so bad. I
mean, yes, it is candy but,\\
197 - you know, you bite both
ends off, you got a straw.\\
198 - It's a metaphor for versatility.\\
199 - No, I think it's
a metaphor for you\\
200 - being long, skinny,
bendy and floppy.\\
201 - Hey, Hyde.\\
202 - Why are you smiling?\\
203 - I don't know.\\
204 - Talk to Angie today?\\
205 - No!\\
206 - Oh, yeah!\\
207 - I have officially nailed
everyone in this room's sister.\\
208 - Hey, Hyde, Kelso and Angie...\\
209 - You already know.\\
210 - Hyde, allow me to be
the first to welcome you\\
211 - to the
Kelso-had-sex-with-my-sister club.\\
212 - There's no
handshake or passwords.\\
213 - There's really just shame.\\
214 - Damn it, Kelso.\\
215 - My sister's been
in town for a month,\\
216 - you've already slept with her.\\
217 - This is why I keep my sister
10,000 miles away in a jungle.\\
218 - Believe me,
if things don't work out\\
219 - with Angie,
I'm on the next flight out.\\
220 - Hey, Hyde, remember
how you kept bringing it up\\
221 - when Kelso nailed my sister?\\
222 - I never understood why,
but now I get it.\\
223 - It's fun.\\
224 - So guess what?
Kelso nailed your sister.\\
225 - Oh, and another thing,
Kelso nailed your sister.\\
226 - Shut up, you little Twizzler.\\
227 - Sticks and stones
may break my bones,\\
228 - but Kelso nailed your sister.\\
229 - Okay, I know you can do this.\\
230 - An egg is not just something
that comes out of a butt.\\
231 - It's a life source, it's
beautiful, so pick it up.\\
232 - Why don't you do it?
You're a nurse.\\
233 - You mess around with
butts all the time.\\
234 - Just pick up the freaking egg,
you spoiled brat.\\
235 - Donna's back on the radio,
maybe she'll mention my shop again.\\
236 - Okay, now it's time
for a new segment on my show.\\
237 - What's on your mind, Hot Donna?\\
238 - When I agreed to promote
the Forman & Son calendar,\\
239 - I had no idea that
it was just pages\\
240 - of half-naked women
straddling drive shafts.\\
241 - Which is wrong.\\
242 - Wrong, because
cars get very hot.\\
243 - So if they were
to do these things,\\
244 - they would easily
burn their thighs.\\
245 - That's right.
Forman & Son Mufflers\\
246 - is promoting
the burning of women.\\
247 - What is she talking about?\\
248 - Now, I would call for a boycott,\\
249 - but girls never go
down to these places,\\
250 - so I call for a going-down-there-
and-yelling-at-them\\
251 - cott.\\
252 - Oh, great. Now I've gotta
go back down to the shop\\
253 - before those hairy-ass
feminists tear the place down.\\
254 - Okay.
Now, I would like to hear\\
255 - from some pissed-off feminists.\\
256 - You're on
the air with Hot Donna.\\
257 - Or, should I say,
Hot-under-the-collar Donna.\\
258 - Donna Pinciotti, you
should be ashamed of yourself.\\
259 - Suddenly you think women
shouldn't be looked at.\\
260 - Well, I've seen your outfits,
Miss Lady Tank Top.\\
261 - Mrs. Forman, this isn't
about me, it's about society.\\
262 - No, it's about Red, who's
been like a second father to you,\\
263 - and now finally he has
something to be proud of\\
264 - and you're forcing your
weirdo hippie politics on it.\\
265 - It's just a couple of
greased-up broads on a Chevy.\\
266 - Get over it.\\
267 - Steven, I can't believe you
thought I'd like these Sex Pistols.\\
268 - I don't want anything
this loud and crabby\\
269 - in my house if I'm
not married to it.\\
270 - I'm sorry, Mrs. Forman.
I'll make it up to you.\\
271 - Have you ever heard of a band
called Judas Priest?\\
272 - Well, that's what
Judas needed, a priest.\\
273 - Are they spiritual?\\
274 - I listen to them every Sunday.\\
275 - Hey, Fez, you're the
candy expert in these parts.\\
276 - Okay, do you think
I'm a Twizzler?\\
277 - Well, you're no Hershey's
Special Dark like your friend Fez.\\
278 - Okay, well, then how
do I un-Twizzle myself?\\
279 - Well, you need to become
richer, more chocolaty.\\
280 - I don't know, just show Donna
who's boss. Take her like a man.\\
281 - I tried that once in bed, but
all I got was a sprained wrist.\\
282 - FYI, advice in Playboy,\\
283 - not always practical if you
can't overpower your woman.\\
284 - Oh, hey, Hyde, how's it
going with the store\\
285 - and Kelso nailing your sister?\\
286 - Steven,\\
287 - stop turning the Pat Boone
albums into Pat Boner albums.\\
288 - Okay, you need to stop sleeping
with Kelso, okay? It's embarrassing.\\
289 - And if you catch something,
we don't have medical.\\
290 - It's not embarrassing. He really
likes me, and I really like him.\\
291 - You don't even know him.\\
292 - You do realize he
has a really bad\\
293 - track record with women, right?\\
294 - Look, I just don't
want to see you get hurt.\\
295 - Oh, my God!
That's so sweet.\\
296 - I finally feel
like I have a brother.\\
297 - Oh, Hyde has a sister\\
298 - who got nailed by Kelso.\\
299 - Mr. Forman, Mrs. Forman
really yelled at me.\\
300 - And I feel bad about what I said\\
301 - on the radio and
I'd like to apologize.\\
302 - Don't worry about it.\\
303 - People have been
coming in non-stop\\
304 - since you talked
about the calendars.\\
305 - I cannot believe all the
disgusting perverts in this town,\\
306 - who listen to my show.\\
307 - Hey, pervs, I'm Hot Donna.\\
308 - Dad?\\
309 - You're with the pervs?\\
310 - I'm just here to support Red.\\
311 - I see that calendar,
put it down.\\
312 - No, I won't put it down.\\
313 - You're the kid and I'm the dad,\\
314 - and I will have
my fantasy ladies.\\
315 - Fine, Dad, but you
won't have my respect.\\
316 - One more woman who
doesn't respect me.\\
317 - That camel's back
broke long ago.\\
318 - Okay, this is Hot Donna
back at the mic...\\
319 - I'm a Twizzler?\\
320 - I'm a Twizzler?\\
321 - Uh-uh.\\
322 - I'm a man.\\
323 - Now you put on Free Bird
'cause we're gonna do it for 13 minutes.\\
324 - Hey, Eric, what do you do when
you have two pieces of wood\\
325 - and want them to stick together?\\
326 - Oh, you nail it.\\
327 - It's easy, it's kind of like how
Kelso nailed Hyde's sister.\\
328 - But I don't know if
I can find a piece of wood\\
329 - that's as slutty
as Hyde's sister.\\
330 - You guys been
working on this a while?\\
331 - About as long as Kelso's
been working on your sister.\\
332 - Stop it. Stop it. Everybody stop
it. Steven, don't listen to them.\\
333 - Okay, I knew you were having a
hard time, so I baked you these cookies.\\
334 - Oh.\\
335 - Ow!\\
336 - Are they no good?\\
337 - No, no, they're good.\\
338 - I'll just suck on them.\\
339 - Oh, forget it, I've ruined them.\\
340 - They didn't make you
feel better at all.\\
341 - Oh, hey, Jackie, you
know who did feel better?\\
342 - Hyde's sister
after Kelso nailed her.\\
343 - Give me those.\\
344 - Hey, Angie.\\
345 - After you close up do you
want to watch me eat a pizza?\\
346 - Look, Michael, I'm not sure
we should see each other again.\\
347 - A lot of people
have told me you're not\\
348 - very serious about
the women you date.\\
349 - A lot of people.\\
350 - A lot, a lot.\\
351 - Everybody.\\
352 - Okay, here's the thing
about those stories.\\
353 - They're all true.\\
354 - I've made a lot of mistakes
in my past, okay?\\
355 - And I could tell
you that I've changed\\
356 - but I would
rather just show you.\\
357 - So why don't we start
off slow as friends?\\
358 - My other friends do
not let me do that.\\
359 - Just do me one favor?\\
360 - Anything.\\
361 - Just don't tell Hyde.\\
362 - No, I gotta tell Hyde.\\
363 - Okay, I've got my candles,
I've got my bubbles,\\
364 - and I've got my soothing,
spiritual, Judas Priest music.
\subsection {Episode 11: Winter}
1 - Guys, check it out.\\
2 - Somebody just left all these
toys at the police station.\\
3 - Guess they figured, if cops
have something to play with,\\
4 - then we won't stress out and
accidentally shoot somebody.\\
5 - Or, and stay with me here,
Inspector Meathead,\\
6 - maybe these toys
are for the toy drive.\\
7 - Yeah, Kelso,
these toys are probably\\
8 - all those needy kids get
on Christmas morning.\\
9 - Holy crap, is that
an Evel Knievel stunt cycle?\\
10 - Oh, my God, let's set it up!\\
11 - We have to find something
for Evel Knievel to crash into,\\
12 - like something funny.\\
13 - Fez, lie down over here
and close your eyes.\\
14 - Man, I feel just like a
kid on, like... I don't know,\\
15 - like, some morning where kids
get to open a lot of presents.\\
16 - Guys, I don't feel
right about this.\\
17 - Oh, buddy, we're not gonna
aim it at your head.\\
18 - No, I'm not
worried about my head.\\
19 - Awesome. He's not
worried about his head?\\
20 - Let's aim it at his head.\\
21 - No, I'm just...\\
22 - I just don't feel right about
taking these toys away from kids.\\
23 - Oh, but, Fez,\\
24 - this could be the Christmas
that I never had.\\
25 - My parents wouldn't get me
cool stuff when I was a kid.\\
26 - Every year, I got a raincoat.\\
27 - And then,
to make sure it worked,\\
28 - we had to go outside and Red
would spray me with the hose.\\
29 - Yeah, Fez.
What about my Christmas, man?\\
30 - I mean, I'd wake up in the
morning, rush out in my PJs,\\
31 - and find what strange man Santa
had left laying underneath my mother.\\
32 - Fine. We'll each open
one present. But only one.\\
33 - All right.\\
34 - Look at what we've done.\\
35 - What should we do now?\\
36 - We need batteries.\\
37 - - A buttload.
- Yeah.\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - Ho, ho, ho!\\
48 - Thanks for helping me with
my Christmas party, girls.\\
49 - You know, this is the most
important event of the year\\
50 - for the Ladies of Point Place,\\
51 - or as we like to call
ourselves, the LOPPs.\\
52 - You know, the LOPPs are known for
being super stuck-up and totally two-faced.\\
53 - I can't wait till I get in.\\
54 - Hey, Mrs. Forman?\\
55 - I need, like,
a buttload of batteries.\\
56 - What for?\\
57 - Oh, um, Kelso wants to see\\
58 - how badly he can shock himself.\\
59 - Oh, okay, they're in the drawer.\\
60 - Oh, hey, Steven, don't forget about
the Ladies of Point Place party tonight.\\
61 - Oh, yeah. I forgot.
Um, I can't go.\\
62 - Something more
important came up.\\
63 - But you promised you'd go.\\
64 - Jackie, if I promised,
I clearly wasn't listening.\\
65 - Which you should've known,
so this is your fault.\\
66 - I can't believe Steven.\\
67 - He knows this is a big deal to
me, and he doesn't even care.\\
68 - Jackie, don't be so hard on him.\\
69 - I know it's a big deal to you
and I don't care.\\
70 - Knock, knock.\\
71 - Patty Ryals, I didn't know
you were back in town.\\
72 - Well, you always return
to where you were young,\\
73 - which I know, for you, Kitty,
is a long time ago.\\
74 - Actually, I just
dropped by to tell you\\
75 - I'm taking over tonight's Ladies
of Point Place Christmas party.\\
76 - What? No, I'm in charge.\\
77 - Past tense.\\
78 - The LOPPs remembered that
you aren't the most reliable L of PP\\
79 - after I reminded them about
the punch-bowl incident of 1973.\\
80 - You dredged up
my Chappaquiddick?\\
81 - What did Mrs. Forman do?\\
82 - She spiked the wrong punch bowl.\\
83 - I missed the sixth grade
Christmas play\\
84 - 'cause I couldn't
walk a straight line.\\
85 - VertiBird central,
you are cleared for takeoff.\\
86 - Prepare to transport funion.\\
87 - We have visual.
Funion's remaining secure.\\
88 - VertiBird to Kelso,
prepare to receive funion.\\
89 - Roger that.\\
90 - Awaiting funion.\\
91 - Funion's under attack!
Funion's under attack!\\
92 - Steady with the funion.\\
93 - Houston, the funion has landed.\\
94 - - Yeah!
- Yeah!\\
95 - - What's going on?
- Eric flew a funion
into my mouth.\\
96 - This is what's more important
than going to a party with me?\\
97 - Jackie,
I think you're overreacting.\\
98 - And yes.\\
99 - You guys seriously
need to grow up.\\
100 - Okay.\\
101 - I think someone's a little mad that
we didn't fly a funion into her mouth.\\
102 - Okay, Steven, I'm going
to that Christmas party,\\
103 - and if you don't come with me
right now, you are in so much trouble.\\
104 - Right now!\\
105 - I'm opening the door.\\
106 - I'm stepping outside.\\
107 - I'm closing the door.\\
108 - You are
in so much trouble!\\
109 - You know, I thought
Steven was maturing.\\
110 - He's out of high school,
he's got a job,\\
111 - and lately he's even been taking
his sunglasses off inside the house.\\
112 - That's real progress, Donna.\\
113 - Well, maybe what's
going on with Hyde\\
114 - is the same thing that's
going on with my boyfriend,\\
115 - Lieutenant Funion.\\
116 - It's that stupid Kelso.\\
117 - He's always talking
them into having fun.\\
118 - Steven should not be having
fun, he should be with me.\\
119 - Okay, girls,
time to get to the party.\\
120 - Well, Jackie, look, I think Eric and
Hyde are feeling the pressures of life,\\
121 - and they want to
have one last blowout.\\
122 - Okay, Steven does
not need a blowout,\\
123 - he needs a kick in the nads.\\
124 - It's Christmas.\\
125 - At holiday time, we say, "He
needs a kick in the sleigh bells."\\
126 - Kitty, these decorations
look awful.\\
127 - This isn't your living room.\\
128 - Everything has to match.\\
129 - You should have mentioned that
to your plastic surgeon.\\
130 - Jackie Burkhart.\\
131 - Welcome to the LOPPs'
Christmas party.\\
132 - Where's your boyfriend?\\
133 - Oh, um, he can't be here.\\
134 - He's at rich stockbroker school.\\
135 - Well, then I'm just
gonna have to seat you\\
136 - with the Single
Ladies of Point Place.\\
137 - The SLOPPs?\\
138 - Ha!
You're a SLOPP.\\
139 - Hey, there, hi, there,
ho, ho, ho there.\\
140 - Patty Ryals? It's me.\\
141 - Well, yes, Santa,
it's good to see you.\\
142 - Bob Pinciotti.
We went out that time?\\
143 - I didn't have the beard then,\\
144 - although I think I wore
a similar red jacket.\\
145 - Speaking of which,
that's rented,\\
146 - so try not to sweat through it.\\
147 - What a woman.\\
148 - Bad news, Kitty.\\
149 - I went by the police station
to pick up the toys.\\
150 - They've been stolen.\\
151 - - What?
- Yeah.\\
152 - Makes me think the police
in this town aren't that good.\\
153 - Red, getting those gifts here\\
154 - was the only job Patty left me.\\
155 - Okay, you need to go home, you
need to find something, anything,\\
156 - to wrap up and give
away at the party.\\
157 - Oh, fine.\\
158 - But this counts as one of
your Christmas presents.\\
159 - This is horrible.\\
160 - Taking toys from children.\\
161 - What kind of monster
would do such a thing?\\
162 - I'm a monster!\\
163 - It's broken already?\\
164 - This toy's stupid.\\
165 - Looks like somebody
needs a nappy-nap.\\
166 - No, I want to
open another present.\\
167 - - Forman, just take a rest.
- I'm not tired, okay?\\
168 - Can I have a turn?\\
169 - I'm playing with it.\\
170 - You're supposed to share.\\
171 - I don't wanna.\\
172 - What the hell?\\
173 - Where did all these
toys come from?\\
174 - Well...\\
175 - Dad, I guess I'm just gonna
have to tell you the truth.\\
176 - It was Santa Claus.\\
177 - How could you do this?\\
178 - I told them it was wrong,
I told them.\\
179 - But then they drove
a toy into my head,\\
180 - and it was all
blurry after that.\\
181 - These toys were
for the needy kids\\
182 - at your mother's party,
you idiot.\\
183 - Oh, man.\\
184 - There's, uh, no chance\\
185 - that they might want
a raincoat, is there?\\
186 - Red, the thing is, is that\\
187 - these toys are too
nice for the needy kids.\\
188 - You need to start them off
with something simple, like\\
189 - a ball of yarn.\\
190 - Look, Dad, I think
we can safely say\\
191 - that none of this
would have happened\\
192 - if you had just bought me
an Evel Knievel stunt cycle\\
193 - when I was younger.\\
194 - I bought you one of those.\\
195 - Santa left it under the tree
that year with...\\
196 - Oh, wait.\\
197 - Okay, Eric's all tucked in,\\
198 - put out carrots
for the reindeer,\\
199 - and a little wine for Santa.\\
200 - Look at this thing
that I got for Eric.\\
201 - You rev up the bike
and Evel Knievel goes flying.\\
202 - In real life he's a moron,
but as a toy he's awfully fun.\\
203 - Let me see if I can make it
over the garage.\\
204 - Go!\\
205 - Damn.\\
206 - I really thought I could
make it over the garage.\\
207 - Oh, well,
everybody makes mistakes.\\
208 - I'm gonna give you
a pass on this one.\\
209 - Just get these presents wrapped
up and over to the community center.\\
210 - Okay. Yeah,
we'll take care of it, Dad.\\
211 - All right.\\
212 - I think it's clear
what we gotta do.\\
213 - Yeah.\\
214 - Can we at least drive the stunt
cycle into Fez's head one more time?\\
215 - What do you say, buddy?\\
216 - Well, it is Christmas.\\
217 - - Set it up, boys.
- All right! Very nice.\\
218 - All right, Kitty.\\
219 - I brought some stuff
from the house\\
220 - that I'm sure
the kids are gonna love.\\
221 - A cheese grater?\\
222 - Kids love cheese.\\
223 - It's like Play-Doh to them.\\
224 - Look, don't worry. The real
presents are gonna be here soon.\\
225 - How do you know?\\
226 - Because you have
to believe, Kitty.\\
227 - Like me.\\
228 - Believe in Christmas.\\
229 - We need to stall.
Read the kids a story.\\
230 - Well, I have a book in the car,
but it's about the Korean War.\\
231 - Well, go get it.\\
232 - Better those kids suffer
emotional damage\\
233 - than I look bad in
front of the LOPPs!\\
234 - Tell you what.\\
235 - Santa will bring you
the bike for Christmas\\
236 - if you go bring Santa a hoagie.\\
237 - You know what I'd really
like for Christmas?\\
238 - Patty Ryals.\\
239 - All you men ever think about
is what you want.\\
240 - What about what we want?\\
241 - Boys never grow up.\\
242 - You know, one minute they agree
to go to a party with you, and the next,\\
243 - they're in a basement
full of stolen toys.\\
244 - And you're no better.\\
245 - Sitting there
pretending to be Santa Claus.\\
246 - You're not Santa Claus?\\
247 - No. No, no, he is.\\
248 - He is, it's just that
she is the evil Ice Witch.\\
249 - Come on, let's get you
some grown-up punch.\\
250 - Well, since we can't bring these
presents through the front door,\\
251 - looks like the chimney's
the only way in.\\
252 - I love being on a rooftop.\\
253 - You can really see the whole
town spread out in front of you.\\
254 - It really is
a crappy town, isn't it?\\
255 - All right, who's gonna
take the plunge?\\
256 - Not me.\\
257 - If we were jumping off
the roof, I'd do it, but...\\
258 - This just seems foolish.\\
259 - You know what?
I'll do it.\\
260 - I've always wanted to save the
day by sliding down a chimney.\\
261 - That opportunity comes up
surprisingly rarely.\\
262 - All right.
I'm gonna do this.\\
263 - Okay, looks like it might be
kind of a tight fit.\\
264 - I don't know if I'm gonna
fit all the way down!\\
265 - All right.\\
266 - Toss down the toys.\\
267 - It's okay, Forman,\\
268 - we're just gonna sneak them in
through the back door.\\
269 - There's a back door?\\
270 - Yeah, I saw it on the way in.\\
271 - I just wanted to see one of
you guys go down the chimney.\\
272 - "Blood ran like a river that
day on Heartbreak Ridge.\\
273 - "Hundreds of soldiers had given
their lives and limbs trying to take..."\\
274 - Trying to take the North Pole.\\
275 - "The North Koreans..."\\
276 - The North Pole Korean elves\\
277 - "were weary from
heat on that sun-baked..."\\
278 - "" Snowy Christmas Eve.\\
279 - Kitty, where are the toys?\\
280 - Oh, um...\\
281 - This year, in order
to build anticipation,\\
282 - I hid them behind the curtain.\\
283 - You can't see them now,
not because they're not there,\\
284 - but because they're
behind the curtain.\\
285 - Hidden.\\
286 - Well, the children won't wait.\\
287 - Gladys, open the curtain.\\
288 - No, no, no, wait. Wait.\\
289 - Boys and girls, I'm sorry.\\
290 - I just, you know, I think
Santa hasn't quite finished his...\\
291 - Christmas\\
292 - Christmas\\
293 - Okay, kids, go get 'em.\\
294 - Who was in charge
of giving out the toys here?\\
295 - It was Kitty.\\
296 - I think she's been drinking.\\
297 - Well, it was perfect.\\
298 - The LOPPs would like you
to run our Valentine's party.\\
299 - I'm in charge? Oh!\\
300 - Oh!\\
301 - This is the same as
Lyndon Johnson\\
302 - being sworn in on the airplane\\
303 - after President Kennedy was...\\
304 - Well, that was a tragedy,
but I'm in charge!\\
305 - You hear that, Patty Ryals?
She's in charge.\\
306 - So you will be
taking orders from her.\\
307 - So put that in your
face-lift and smoke it.\\
308 - Oh, look
at the two of you.\\
309 - Isn't this just
the most special Christmas?\\
310 - Where's Eric?\\
311 - Yeah, um...\\
312 - Um, yeah,\\
313 - just a quick question.\\
314 - Um, where does that
chimney up on the roof go?\\
315 - Well, I'm kind of
a chimney enthusiast.\\
316 - Oh, well, that goes into
the bakery next door.\\
317 - Hello?\\
318 - Hyde?\\
319 - Somebody?\\
320 - I'll be at the bakery.\\
321 - Damn.
That's a nice crop of SLOPPs.\\
322 - Look at who decided
to finally show up.\\
323 - Jackie, are you still mad?\\
324 - Come on, man,
this is not a big deal.\\
325 - I mean, six months ago, you would
have thought this is really funny.\\
326 - Yeah, six months ago.\\
327 - Steven, you can't
act like this forever.\\
328 - I need to know
the guy I'm in love with\\
329 - isn't gonna blow me off
for a room full of toys.\\
330 - That's not a guarantee
I can ever give you.\\
331 - Well, things are
changing, Steven.\\
332 - I mean, we're practically
grown up.\\
333 - Yeah, and you know what?
I'm just trying to have a little fun\\
334 - before I settle down
and life goes to crap.\\
335 - Is that what you think?
That life with me will be crap?\\
336 - That's not what I said.\\
337 - No, it's okay. At least
now I know how you feel.\\
338 - Jackie.\\
339 - I'm sorry, I don't
remember our date, Barry.\\
340 - It's Bob.\\
341 - But since it is Christmas Eve
and we are both alone,\\
342 - would you like to
get some dinner?\\
343 - I like the way you're thinking.\\
344 - Or we could skip dinner.\\
345 - Well, I'm more active
with a burger in me.\\
346 - Hey, Hyde,\\
347 - you and Jackie fix things up?\\
348 - I don't know, man.\\
349 - If she wants to ruin
Christmas, fine by me,\\
350 - 'cause I am not
playing her game.\\
351 - It's the stupid needy kids
who are playing games.\\
352 - They took all of our games.\\
353 - Look what I found in the
bakery, curled up in the fireplace.\\
354 - What the hell?\\
355 - You guys just left me there.\\
356 - If I hadn't landed on,\\
357 - well, some of the most delicious
baked goods that I ever tasted,\\
358 - I very well could have
starved to death.\\
359 - All right, man,
I'll make it up to you,\\
360 - 'cause I got a Christmas
present for everybody.\\
361 - This is one messed up
Christmas, man.\\
362 - You guys are all starting
to look like elves.\\
363 - That must have freaked you out.\\
364 - - It's gonna fall off.
- It's okay.\\
365 - Oh, my God,
it is gonna fall off.\\
366 - - It's okay.
- Okay.\\
367 - Let me give you my recipe
for holiday cheer.\\
368 - Take one SLOPP,
add half a bottle of schnapps,\\
369 - then stir freely with Fez.\\
370 - It is a wonderful life.\\
371 - - Merry Christmas, Son.
- Oh, my God.\\
372 - You finally got me
an Evel Knievel stunt cycle!\\
373 - Ooh, you can go outside
in your new raincoat\\
374 - and give it a try.\\
375 - Ooh.\\
376 - Oh, Red. Not again.\\
377 - Well, it's his own damn fault\\
378 - for wanting a toy that's so fun.
\subsection {Episode 12: Don't Lie to Me}
1 - Hey, you still mad at me
about the Christmas party?\\
2 - No, I'm just starting to realize\\
3 - you might never be the man
I'd dreamed you'd be.\\
4 - That's the spirit,
lower your expectations.\\
5 - Well, I have one last
wedding thing to return,\\
6 - and once this is done, the only
thing I'll have left to remind me\\
7 - we almost got married
will be you.\\
8 - Oh...\\
9 - Well, I wish Eric had
shown up for your wedding.\\
10 - The sales lady said
my mother-of-the-groom dress\\
11 - took five pounds off me.\\
12 - Five pounds.\\
13 - Okay, what happened
to my nice breakfast?\\
14 - I thought we were done
with this whole wedding deal.\\
15 - Women are never
done with it, son.\\
16 - Anything wrong you do,\\
17 - they sit on it for
25 years like an egg.\\
18 - And then it hatches
on Super Bowl Sunday.\\
19 - Oh, man, I can't believe I have to take
these shoes back to Wanamaker Bridal.\\
20 - Now I have to tell that snot,
Stacy Wanamaker,\\
21 - that I didn't get married.\\
22 - Oh, wait, Donna,
I'll take them back for you.\\
23 - I've always wanted
to meet Stacy Wanamaker.\\
24 - I mean, she's everything
I've ever wanted to be,\\
25 - gorgeous, popular, which,
of course, I already am,\\
26 - but she's also married.\\
27 - And to a guy who owns
a real estate company\\
28 - that puts her face on his signs.\\
29 - Oh, she's like a Kennedy.\\
30 - Yeah, Stacy Wanamaker
was a high school legend.\\
31 - All the guys would say,
"I do wanna make her."\\
32 - I always wish I had a name
that could be done, too.\\
33 - Jackie has a nice rackie?\\
34 - I like Jackie on her backie?\\
35 - Oh...\\
36 - Thanks, you guys.\\
37 - Well, thanks for dinner.\\
38 - Thanks for dessert.\\
39 - Thanks for breakfast.\\
40 - Thanks for dessert.\\
41 - Congratulations, Angie.\\
42 - You just got four
different kinds of herpes.\\
43 - Hey, Hyde, I just learned
something very important.\\
44 - You know that saying,
"It's like kissing your sister"?\\
45 - Well, it's totally wrong 'cause
kissing your sister is great.\\
46 - Oh, oh, there's Stacy Wanamaker.\\
47 - Hi. Um, I'm here
to return these shoes.\\
48 - - Name?
- Donna Pinciotti.\\
49 - Good heavens,
these are for a giant.\\
50 - Were they too big?\\
51 - Oh, no, no.
The wedding was canceled.\\
52 - Yeah, the groom said
"I don't."\\
53 - Oh, Donna, how awful.\\
54 - What? Oh, no, no...\\
55 - I just know how complete
being married has made me,\\
56 - and I always feel so sad
when I see girls your age,\\
57 - whose window to find that
kind of happiness is so, so small.\\
58 - It is not that small.\\
59 - Honey, I've seen
a lot of girls like you\\
60 - who wasted years on a guy
who never came through,\\
61 - and before you know it,\\
62 - you're past your
expiration date.\\
63 - Well, that is not gonna happen
to me because\\
64 - I'm still getting married.\\
65 - Yeah, see, I canceled the other
wedding 'cause I traded in up.\\
66 - - Him.
- Who?\\
67 - - You.
- What?\\
68 - Yes.\\
69 - Uh, this is Eduardo,
and he's, um...\\
70 - A prince.\\
71 - He's the prince of Mexico.\\
72 - Well, then we are going
to make your wedding\\
73 - the best wedding ever,
right, Donna?\\
74 - Donna?\\
75 - Apparently, that's you.\\
76 - Oh, yes.
What? Yes.\\
77 - You just have to come to the
big wedding expo this weekend.\\
78 - Oh, well, that sounds great.\\
79 - Eduardo and I
would love to be there.\\
80 - Right, Eduardo?\\
81 - Just a few weeks left to
stretch those wings, huh, toots?\\
82 - Eduardo!\\
83 - What? Oh, yes,
my bride. Yes.\\
84 - Hanging out\\
85 - Down the street\\
86 - The same old thing\\
87 - We did last week\\
88 - Not a thing to do\\
89 - But talk to you\\
90 - We're all all right\\
91 - We're all all right\\
92 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
93 - Hey. Oh, uh, Hyde,
Angie can't make it\\
94 - to the movie with you
because, uh...\\
95 - Well, I plumb wore her out.\\
96 - Kelso, Jackie and I
are fighting right now,\\
97 - and I'm in a really bad mood.\\
98 - So if you don't
stop nailing my sister,\\
99 - I'm gonna have to smack
you in the head with my car.\\
100 - Actually, you can't
do anything to me,\\
101 - because after you
stole Jackie from me,\\
102 - we made a pact not to interfere\\
103 - with each other's pursuit
of a chick.\\
104 - I negotiated the pact,\\
105 - which mainly consisted
of Kelso telling me\\
106 - to tell Hyde to sit on it.\\
107 - How come you guys
always have pacts?\\
108 - You never give me a pact.\\
109 - I want a pact.\\
110 - Well, I would love
to stick around and chat,\\
111 - but I gotta go home
and take a shower\\
112 - 'cause Hyde's sister
wears a lot of perfume,\\
113 - and she was all over me.\\
114 - Freaking pact.\\
115 - You know, Hyde,\\
116 - this doesn't have
to be a problem.\\
117 - I happen to know a lot of
ways out of a pact, my friend.\\
118 - That's true.\\
119 - We once had a pact
to get married,\\
120 - but then he just didn't show up.\\
121 - So you think you can get her
to break up with him?\\
122 - Maybe.\\
123 - But that would require you and
I going into business together,\\
124 - i.e., forming a pact.\\
125 - Which would mean\\
126 - you gotta do something for me.\\
127 - I don't think so, man.\\
128 - This is a starter pact.\\
129 - You handle this,\\
130 - you get a big-boy pact.\\
131 - I don't know, Eric,
the starter pact.\\
132 - I mean, that sounds a lot
like training wheels,\\
133 - and you were on those
for a really long time.\\
134 - Stacy, hi.\\
135 - Donna, welcome.\\
136 - Here is your bride-to-be sash.\\
137 - And a tiara.\\
138 - Can I get a sash?\\
139 - What do you do with a sash?\\
140 - I don't care.
I want a sash.\\
141 - Welcome to the beginning
of a whole new life.\\
142 - Wow, this really
is a whole new life.\\
143 - Oh, did you get
some champagne, too?\\
144 - Oh, I can't.
I'm six months pregnant.\\
145 - Can't you tell?
I'm huge.\\
146 - She's perfect.\\
147 - Now, Eduardo, you'll have no say\\
148 - in any of the decisions
about your wedding,\\
149 - so go sit in the grooms' lounge.\\
150 - Oh, goody, new friends.\\
151 - Hey.\\
152 - Hey.\\
153 - Hey.\\
154 - Oh, perfect, everyone's here.\\
155 - Wow, look at all of us\\
156 - just "pact" right in here, huh?\\
157 - Mom, Dad, you remember Angie.\\
158 - Of course they remember me.\\
159 - I'm the only black
girl in town. Hello.\\
160 - Funny thing about Angie,
she dates Kelso.\\
161 - - Oh, honey.
- Tough break.\\
162 - So, anyone have any stories
about Angie's new boyfriend\\
163 - and some of his crazy antics?\\
164 - What do you want? I got
one with water, one with fire,\\
165 - one where he burned
himself under water.\\
166 - Oh, okay,\\
167 - I got a good one.\\
168 - Michael, what are you doing
with my blender?\\
169 - Don't worry,
it's not what you think.\\
170 - I'm making a blender rocket.\\
171 - I couldn't have
daiquiris for a week.\\
172 - I've got a better one.\\
173 - Kelso, it's 6:00
in the morning.\\
174 - Someone glue you to the fridge?\\
175 - No.\\
176 - Kelso, did you glue
yourself to the fridge?\\
177 - Yes.\\
178 - Thanks, man.\\
179 - Why does he glue
himself to stuff?\\
180 - Because he's a big dumb-dumb.\\
181 - Next.\\
182 - Okay, I got one.\\
183 - Donna, check it out.\\
184 - I invented car skiing.\\
185 - Hit it, toots.\\
186 - You know, if there's anything
he should have glued himself to,\\
187 - it was probably
the top of that car.\\
188 - Steven, why are you doing this?\\
189 - Doing what?
Forman's doing it.\\
190 - Clearly, you're in charge.\\
191 - Whoa. It's my pact, I...\\
192 - Why wouldn't you
think I'm in charge?\\
193 - Oh, it's probably because of
your narrow shoulders, honey.\\
194 - They just don't shout
"leader," you know.\\
195 - Oh, and Jim raises a lipstick.\\
196 - Pretty confident, huh, Jim?\\
197 - That's right, I am all in.\\
198 - Okay, read 'em and weep.\\
199 - Two, four, six, eight, ten.\\
200 - All evens.\\
201 - Stacy, this is so much fun.\\
202 - You know, I never thought
I'd end up here.\\
203 - Steven never once
discussed marriage.\\
204 - Steven?\\
205 - My butler, he is so uppity.\\
206 - Eduardo, where's my purse?\\
207 - I was mugged.\\
208 - Donna, come to my cousin's
wedding this weekend\\
209 - and check out her band.\\
210 - All right, we'll be there.\\
211 - No, we won't, Donna.\\
212 - It's insane.\\
213 - Excuse me, my fiancee told me
I have to give this back.\\
214 - Angie just broke up with me.\\
215 - No.\\
216 - I don't know what happened.\\
217 - She just dumped me,
like, out of nowhere,\\
218 - and I was gonna
take her car skiing.\\
219 - I need a hug from your mother.\\
220 - Take off the training
wheels, buddy,\\
221 - 'cause it looks like somebody's
ready for his big-boy pact.\\
222 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
223 - I have to go pull
Kelso off my mother.\\
224 - Jackie, we're not really
going to this wedding, are we?\\
225 - I have to, Fez. It feels
so good to be a fiancee.\\
226 - But you're not a fiancee.\\
227 - You're a super cute high school
girl that I've been spying on\\
228 - through a window
for three-and-a-half years.\\
229 - Isn't that enough?\\
230 - Hey, what's up?\\
231 - Nothing.\\
232 - Usually when I
ask that question,\\
233 - you don't stop talking
till I pretend to fall asleep.\\
234 - Ah, well, not today.\\
235 - You look guilty.\\
236 - What did you do?
Fez, what did she do?\\
237 - Oh, I wasn't listening.\\
238 - I was thinking about this
prince named Eduardo\\
239 - and his lunatic queen.\\
240 - Seriously, Steven,
everything's fine.\\
241 - All right, but I'm telling you,\\
242 - there's gonna be hell to pay\\
243 - if you've donated all my
clothes to the Goodwill again.\\
244 - Now we're lying to Hyde.\\
245 - This is messed up, woman.\\
246 - Fez, I know it's a little crazy,\\
247 - but what if this is all I get?\\
248 - I mean, what if Steven
never wants to settle down?\\
249 - What if I never get
a real wedding\\
250 - or real happiness
or real anything?\\
251 - What if I'm just living in my
pink bedroom alone forever?\\
252 - Fine, I'll go.\\
253 - But please remember,
you're never alone in there.\\
254 - I called Angie, like, 20 times,\\
255 - and she won't even
answer the phone.\\
256 - Wow, I guess something
really turned her off.\\
257 - Something incredibly powerful.\\
258 - All right.\\
259 - So I've narrowed it down
to two reasons\\
260 - why Angie might have
broken up with me.\\
261 - She's either
a lesbian or a robot.\\
262 - Come on, man, it's just
a girl. You'll get over it.\\
263 - Hey, do something for you.\\
264 - Take up smoking.\\
265 - I don't wanna get over it. I just
want Angie back. I'm going home.\\
266 - Wow, he really liked her.\\
267 - I feel like I kicked a puppy.\\
268 - Well, this is what happens when
you get into a pact with Eric Forman,\\
269 - complete and utter devastation.\\
270 - What?\\
271 - So, Fez, what do you think?
Do you like my dress?\\
272 - Yeah, it's okay, but you know
what would be more appropriate?\\
273 - A straitjacket.\\
274 - Because you're a Looney Tune.\\
275 - - But, Fez...
- I said cuckoo!\\
276 - Donna, Eduardo,\\
277 - I want you to meet
my cousin, Janie.\\
278 - - Hi.
- Hi.\\
279 - It is so nice to see
two people declare their love\\
280 - in such an expensive way.\\
281 - So, Janie, you are looking good.\\
282 - What are you doing later?\\
283 - Um, going on my honeymoon.\\
284 - You play hard-to-get.\\
285 - I play hard-to-get-rid-of.\\
286 - FYI. For your wedding, Donna,\\
287 - tables one and two, where we
are sitting, are the popular tables.\\
288 - Tables five and up are for
friends you have to invite\\
289 - and relatives who drive trucks.\\
290 - We are gonna get caught.\\
291 - Oh, no, we're not, Fez, okay?\\
292 - No one knows us here.
We'll be fine. Come on.\\
293 - I can't believe they
put us at table seven.\\
294 - I went to high school
with the bride's mother.\\
295 - That's it, I'm milking
the open bar as punishment.\\
296 - Well, hell, we could have
stayed home for that.\\
297 - Hey, Donna,\\
298 - I'm not wearing any
underwear under this.\\
299 - Does that...
Does that turn you on?\\
300 - No,\\
301 - that only works when I do it.\\
302 - Ooh.\\
303 - Well, sucks to be the next guy
to rent this tux, huh?\\
304 - All right, Angie,
here's the deal.\\
305 - I did want everybody to tell
you those stories about Kelso,\\
306 - and that was wrong,\\
307 - 'cause he really likes you,
so you have to take him back.\\
308 - Steven, this is so unlike you.\\
309 - Well, a friend of mine sent me
a really big baggie from Hawaii.\\
310 - So I'm gonna be saying
all sorts of crazy stuff\\
311 - over the next couple of weeks.\\
312 - Well, I didn't break up with
Michael because of the stories.\\
313 - I broke up with him because
I saw it was bothering you,\\
314 - and we have a business to run.\\
315 - Look, just do me a favor
and take him back.\\
316 - I'll think about it.\\
317 - Oh, man, Hyde,\\
318 - it is not easy
doing it on your desk.\\
319 - Okay, so I may have
already thought about it.\\
320 - He's so good-looking.\\
321 - Crap, it's Stacy Wanamaker.\\
322 - Damn, I do wanna make her...\\
323 - Uh, go to beauty school
'cause she's ugly.\\
324 - You look familiar.
Do I know you?\\
325 - Um, yeah, hi.
I'm Donna Pinciotti.\\
326 - Donna.\\
327 - Donna, she says she's Donna.\\
328 - - Donna!
- Donna!\\
329 - - Donna!
- Donna!\\
330 - Eduardo.\\
331 - No, she's Donna.\\
332 - Why would you lie?\\
333 - Are you even engaged?\\
334 - Well, I can't believe a prince
was taken in by a common liar.\\
335 - - Hey.
- Hey, how was the wedding?\\
336 - Well, the service was beautiful,\\
337 - the flowers were gorgeous,\\
338 - and your girlfriend
was a humiliating wackadoo.\\
339 - Jackie was there?\\
340 - Are we still
walking from the car?\\
341 - This is taking forever.\\
342 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
343 - I thought you'd be on a plane
back to Prince Eduardo Land by now.\\
344 - Donna's mouth is
as big as her feet.\\
345 - Jackie, what the hell
were you thinking?\\
346 - Look, Steven, I know it's a
crazy thing to do. It's just...\\
347 - I wanted to know
what it was like\\
348 - to be planning a life and
a wedding and everything.\\
349 - I mean, that's all
I've ever wanted.\\
350 - And I was starting to think it
was never gonna happen with you.\\
351 - My God,
are we back on this again?\\
352 - Why can't you just be happy
with what we've got?\\
353 - Because I'm not, Steven.\\
354 - Okay, look, I need to know
that we have a future together.\\
355 - Can't you just give me some kind
of sign or just a tiny glimmer of hope\\
356 - that maybe some day
we'll get married?\\
357 - Jackie, I don't know.\\
358 - My God, that's all you ever say.\\
359 - Please, Steven,
please just say anything\\
360 - besides "I don't know."
Anything else.\\
361 - - I don't know.
- Okay.\\
362 - Well, then I can't
be with you anymore.\\
363 - Jackie, don't threaten me,
okay? It's not gonna work.\\
364 - I'm not threatening you, Steven.\\
365 - I can't waste any more
of my time on you\\
366 - if it's not gonna happen for us.\\
367 - Okay, well, at least now I know.\\
368 - Janie.\\
369 - Janie?\\
370 - Has anyone seen the bride?
The limo's waiting\\
371 - and the groom's gonna
pass out any second.\\
372 - Janie?\\
373 - Janie, what are you doing?\\
374 - What are you doing? Have
a little respect for the bride.\\
375 - Unless you wanna join us.
Yes? No?
\subsection {Episode 13: Can't You Hear Me Knocking}
1 - So, Hyde, how are you doing now
that you and Jackie are broken up?\\
2 - I am the old Hyde again, kept
by no woman, loyal to no man.\\
3 - Beholden to no comb.\\
4 - No, Steven, does so use a
comb, it's one of those Afro picks.\\
5 - You should wear it
sticking out of your hair.\\
6 - - Hello, Steven.
- Jackie.\\
7 - You wanna talk?\\
8 - What would I have to say to you?\\
9 - I don't know, how about,\\
10 - "I'm a crazy, spoiled,
whack job, and I'm sorry."\\
11 - That's no way to
talk to a woman.\\
12 - Yeah, especially a spoiled,
crazy, whack job.\\
13 - She's liable to kill you.\\
14 - Oh, my God.\\
15 - There's a hundred morons
in my basement.\\
16 - That's okay, not even
that can ruin this day.\\
17 - Yes, one man, and only one
man, has the power to ruin his day.\\
18 - 'Tis I.\\
19 - Nope, not even you can do it.\\
20 - But really,
who the hell talks like that?\\
21 - Now, now, Red,
you were happy, remember?\\
22 - Right. First freeze of winter,\\
23 - I'm spending
the day ice fishing.\\
24 - Well, I'll come with you.
Grab a fishing stick for me.\\
25 - I don't wanna go.\\
26 - - What? Why not?
- Because I don't
want you to go.\\
27 - Burn!\\
28 - Really, I mean, Kitty,
you'd hate it.\\
29 - It's cold and boring,\\
30 - and we both know the only ice
you like is in your cocktails.\\
31 - Nonsense.\\
32 - We're going ice fishing, and we're
gonna have fun, and that's that.\\
33 - Yeah.\\
34 - That's that.\\
35 - Jackie, seriously, isn't there anything
you wanna say about what you did?\\
36 - No, I have much more
important things to do with my day.\\
37 - Donna, what are we
doing with our day?\\
38 - - I'm going to karate class.
- I knew it'd be
something sweaty.\\
39 - - You don't have to go.
- No, no, no, I'm going. I'm going.\\
40 - Now that I'm not with Steven,\\
41 - I have much more time to do
mannish, unladylike things with you.\\
42 - I'll give you 50 bucks
to take her back.\\
43 - 50 bucks buys me beer for a
week, freedom lasts a lifetime.\\
44 - Look at our
poor little tough guy,\\
45 - hurting others
to ease his own pain.\\
46 - I think someone needs a tickle.\\
47 - No, I'm okay.\\
48 - Look, Hyde, we're your best
friends, and we're here for you, okay.\\
49 - We're not gonna let you
go through this thing alone.\\
50 - Would you shut up, Forman?
I'm fine.\\
51 - You know what, Eric's right.\\
52 - We're gonna do
what guys do for each other.\\
53 - A massage train?\\
54 - No.\\
55 - But we did get you a present.\\
56 - It's a great present, guys.\\
57 - I especially like the teeny
white paper you all wrapped it in.\\
58 - Yeah, the only thing that could
ruin today is if the Russians set off\\
59 - that Russian death ray that's
pointed at the White House.\\
60 - No, seriously. No, I read
about it in a magazine.\\
61 - Kelso, that was The Flash,
and it is a comic book.\\
62 - I love comic books.
I wish I had thought bubbles.\\
63 - You see anything?\\
64 - Kelso, the Russians
don't have a death ray,\\
65 - but they do have a stupid ray
and it's pointed directly at you.\\
66 - No, the Russians do have
a death ray, and I'll prove it.\\
67 - Operator,
give me the White House.\\
68 - Kelso, I'm not allowed to make
long distance calls without permission.\\
69 - Oh, awesome, I'm on hold,\\
70 - and they're playing that
theme song to the President.\\
71 - Hail to the Chief.\\
72 - Thank you, Eric, but I'm trying to
enjoy the President's theme song.\\
73 - Hanging out\\
74 - Down the street\\
75 - The same old thing\\
76 - We did last week\\
77 - Not a thing to do\\
78 - But talk to you\\
79 - We're all all right\\
80 - We're all all right\\
81 - Hello Wisconsin!\\
82 - Kelso, if you ask the White
House if there's a Russian death ray,\\
83 - they're gonna
have you committed.\\
84 - So, yeah, I say go for it.\\
85 - Well, obviously they won't admit
it. There'd be panic in the streets.\\
86 - That's why I gotta trick them
into talking about it.\\
87 - It's what us cops
call "tricking them."\\
88 - I'm on. Hello? White House?\\
89 - Yeah, yes, I have
a couple of questions.\\
90 - Yes, how well is
the President protected?\\
91 - Well, because someone wants
to hurt the President, that's why.\\
92 - You're damn right it's a threat,\\
93 - it's a terrible threat
on the President's life.\\
94 - Awesome.\\
95 - What? Where am I right now? I'm in
Red Forman's house in Point Place...\\
96 - No!\\
97 - You idiot, you just told
them where we are.\\
98 - So?\\
99 - Kelso, you just threatened
the President's life.\\
100 - They're gonna come
here and arrest us.\\
101 - No, no,
I'm not threatening his life.\\
102 - It's the Russians that have
the Russian death ray.\\
103 - You didn't mention
the death ray.\\
104 - A-ha! So you admit that
there's a death ray.\\
105 - Well, this is boring.\\
106 - Let's do something fun.
Oh, let's play 20 questions.\\
107 - Kitty, I'm trying to fish.\\
108 - Okay, you think of something,
I'll ask the questions.\\
109 - - Is it a thing?
- Yes.\\
110 - - Is it small?
- Yes.\\
111 - - Is it a raisin?
- Yes, you win.\\
112 - Well, you're not even playing.\\
113 - - What's so great
about ice fishing anyway?
- It was the solitude.\\
114 - Well, I'm freezing.\\
115 - This is like that winter we locked
ourselves out of our first apartment.\\
116 - We had to sit on the stoop,
cuddled up for two hours,\\
117 - waiting for the landlord
to bring the key.\\
118 - And then we had to warm
ourselves up in front of the stove\\
119 - because the heater was broken.\\
120 - We could warm each
other up right now.\\
121 - What the hell.\\
122 - There's a black Ford sedan outside.
Hyde's right, the Feds found us.\\
123 - Damn it, Kelso.\\
124 - You finally figure out how to use
a phone, now we're all going to jail.\\
125 - I think you guys
are overreacting.\\
126 - There's no way the government
would park a car right outside my house.\\
127 - Forman, anything you think
the government's not doing,\\
128 - they are doing.\\
129 - The only thing they didn't do
is land the man on the moon.\\
130 - No, no, no, no, no.\\
131 - Spielberg shot the entire
thing in a Hollywood movie set.\\
132 - That's how he got
the job for Jaws.\\
133 - Guys, if that's
a Feds' car outside,\\
134 - we better dispose
of the evidence right now.\\
135 - Oh, yeah.\\
136 - Good job disposing
of all the evidence, you guys.\\
137 - You better take
this serious, Eric.\\
138 - We have a lot of
evidence to dispose of,\\
139 - even more than we had
at the Pink Floyd concert.\\
140 - Yeah, there is a lot.\\
141 - And without all the smoke
machines and lasers,\\
142 - this is just like punishment.\\
143 - Man,
I never thought I'd say this,\\
144 - but I wish there were more
people to share this with.\\
145 - This is a nightmare.
White suit with yellow belt!\\
146 - Okay, Jackie O couldn't
even pull this off on Easter.\\
147 - - Donna-san,
you brought a friend?
- Yes, sensei, this is Jackie.\\
148 - Welcome, Jackie-san.\\
149 - Now, today we'll be focusing
on self-defense.\\
150 - Let's say someone is
accosting you in a dark alley.\\
151 - Oh, that doesn't work for me.\\
152 - I'd never be in an alley
'cause I'm not poor.\\
153 - And even if I was ever in an alley,
I'd have a boy with me to protect me.\\
154 - Jackie, you're not always
gonna be with a guy.\\
155 - You're not with one now.\\
156 - - And, no, I don't count.
- Okay.\\
157 - An assault can happen
anywhere, Jackie-san.\\
158 - The point is,
someone wants to do you harm.\\
159 - But they don't.\\
160 - All right, maybe someone would follow
these other women to do them harm,\\
161 - but when people follow me,\\
162 - it's to ask me where I get my hair
done or to just give me presents.\\
163 - That's true.\\
164 - - I've seen it.
- Yeah.\\
165 - This is our third circle and it
hasn't calmed me down at all.\\
166 - I feel almost more
suspicious than before.\\
167 - I don't want to get sent back
to my home country.\\
168 - If I return in shame, I'll get stoned.
And then, you'll throw rocks at me.\\
169 - Everybody just settle
down, okay. Settle down!\\
170 - You are all losing your minds!
Who is yelling?\\
171 - We all just need to keep calm.\\
172 - That's the door.
We're all gonna die!\\
173 - It's okay. It's okay.
I know what to do. Okay.\\
174 - Eric, you answer the door,
we'll all sneak out the back.\\
175 - What?\\
176 - Yeah, yeah. No, no,
you'll go to jail,\\
177 - I'll pull some strings
to get you out.\\
178 - Point Place PD
has connections with the FBI,\\
179 - one of our dogs
transferred from there.\\
180 - May I speak to your parents?\\
181 - There's no need.\\
182 - I'll go quietly.\\
183 - I'm just delivering the hand
vac Mrs. Forman ordered.\\
184 - Okay, I'm the one who called,\\
185 - and all I was saying
is beware of the death ray.\\
186 - Yeah, I'll do that.\\
187 - By the way, the whole neighborhood
can smell what you're doing.\\
188 - Oh, my God. Did you see his
earpiece? He's definitely FBI.\\
189 - There's no other reason why a
man would be wearing an earpiece.\\
190 - Oh, don't punt,
you've got one yard to go.\\
191 - Guys, I've read about this.
That's the recon guy.\\
192 - He's the one that
plants the bugs.\\
193 - I hate bugs.
Is it on me? Is it on me?\\
194 - No, not... Like a bug,
like a microphone.\\
195 - Oh, my God.\\
196 - We've been infiltrated.\\
197 - Guys, if this vacuum is bugged,\\
198 - the FBI could be listening
to us right now.\\
199 - Well, I think the important
thing is to stick together.\\
200 - You know what?
You are absolutely right, Fez.\\
201 - This is all for one
and one for all.\\
202 - You're looking
for Michael Kelso.\\
203 - Quit it.\\
204 - No, I'm not gonna quit it,
okay? This is all your fault.\\
205 - - You called the White House.
- My fault? This is my...\\
206 - This is Hyde's fault 'cause he's
the one who got dumped by Jackie\\
207 - so we had to be nice to him.\\
208 - Hey, hey, hey,
go easy on the kid.\\
209 - Letting go of Jackie was the
biggest mistake he ever made.\\
210 - Remember, we were talking
about it earlier, behind his back?\\
211 - Shut up, Fez.\\
212 - If I wanted your advice,
I'd kick you in the nads.\\
213 - Oh, in that case, my advice is
please don't kick me in the nads.\\
214 - Hey, guys, you know what?\\
215 - Maybe the FBI has an opinion
'cause they're listening to us.\\
216 - Remember the V-A-C-U-U-M?\\
217 - It spelled "vacuum."\\
218 - Whoa, vacuum has
two "u's" in it?\\
219 - No, that's messed up.\\
220 - Okay, well, maybe we should turn
it on and see if it's really a vacuum,\\
221 - and if it is, maybe we
should tidy up a bit.\\
222 - Wait. One question.\\
223 - If the vacuum really was bugged,\\
224 - couldn't we just put it outside?\\
225 - Damn.\\
226 - When Kelso's the only one
thinking straight, we're in trouble.\\
227 - Guys, we're making
too many mistakes.\\
228 - We need to sit down
and figure this out.\\
229 - Okay, this is starting
to feel like work, man.\\
230 - Feds have ruined the circle.\\
231 - The circle sucks.\\
232 - That's right, I said it.\\
233 - Hey, this circle is the only
thing that's keeping us sharp.\\
234 - If it weren't for this circle, we'd have no
idea that the Feds were surrounding us,\\
235 - planting bugs everywhere,
watching our every move.\\
236 - So I say thank you
to the circle.\\
237 - I just want everyone to know I'm
prepared to fight my way out of here.\\
238 - You know, I don't even care
if the fish aren't biting\\
239 - 'cause nothing could beat
hanging out with my girl.\\
240 - Well, in that case, I have
another idea for a game.\\
241 - It's like 20 questions but sexy.\\
242 - I call it sexy 20 questions.\\
243 - Okay, I'll ask the questions.\\
244 - Is it something I want?\\
245 - Every Saturday,
twice on Christmas.\\
246 - I got a bite.\\
247 - Good, Donna-san.\\
248 - Jackie-san, would you like to try the
move that Donna-san just performed?\\
249 - But none of this self-defense
stuff applies to me.\\
250 - Okay, I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.\\
251 - Everyone loves me.\\
252 - You don't understand. I am a
stranger who wants to hurt you.\\
253 - I'm not buying it.\\
254 - Okay, Jackie, let's say
he's not a stranger.\\
255 - Let's say he's someone
who already hurt you.\\
256 - Like Hyde.\\
257 - What about him?\\
258 - Well, you asked Hyde
for a tiny glimmer of hope\\
259 - that you guys would
end up married one day.\\
260 - But he said, "I don't know."\\
261 - "I don't know."\\
262 - As if Jackie Burkhart
weren't special at all.\\
263 - - Watch it, Donna.
- I mean...\\
264 - I mean, I thought
Jackie Burkhart was special.\\
265 - But according to Hyde,
you're no better than me.\\
266 - All men are bastards!\\
267 - That jerk didn't want me!
I'm better than everyone!\\
268 - Hyde, you've lost the best
thing when you lost me!\\
269 - And it's not Jackie-san!
It's Jackie! Just Jackie!\\
270 - Nothing more than Jackie!
Get it right, Dork-san!\\
271 - I love karate.\\
272 - I cannot believe it.\\
273 - Now they have
a surveillance van outside.\\
274 - I hope they're
not taking pictures.\\
275 - I'm a little puffy.\\
276 - Okay, this has gone too far,
we didn't do anything wrong.\\
277 - What kind of country is this\\
278 - if you can't make one threatening
phone call to the White House?\\
279 - - Let's find out what's
really going on here.
- Yeah.\\
280 - You know, that's not
a real weapon, right?\\
281 - I know.\\
282 - Not even if you really,
really believe.\\
283 - I don't.\\
284 - Don't let me down, baby.\\
285 - Wait a minute,
it's just a dogcatcher van.\\
286 - Well, hello, that's exactly
what the Feds want us to think.\\
287 - But I just heard
dogs barking inside.\\
288 - It's obviously a tape
recording of trained dogs.\\
289 - The barking's
too self-conscious.\\
290 - Plus, a dogcatcher van
wouldn't just say "dog catcher"\\
291 - on the side of it,\\
292 - 'cause otherwise the dogs
would see it and just run away.\\
293 - On three. One, two, three!\\
294 - I don't understand.\\
295 - Look, I don't know
if it's the fresh air talking,\\
296 - but I'm starting to think this
whole thing's just our imagination.\\
297 - You know what, you guys,\\
298 - maybe we just need to let this
whole fantasy world of ours go.\\
299 - Whoa.\\
300 - Watch out, man, I almost
just cut you right in half there.\\
301 - Kitty, I'm sorry.\\
302 - I didn't mean to
throw you to the floor.\\
303 - It's just that that was the
first fish I caught this year.\\
304 - That was a nice perch, it was a big perch,
might have been a state-record perch.\\
305 - If it means anything,
you're my state-record lady.\\
306 - Okay, I guess I forgive you.\\
307 - I knew you'd understand.\\
308 - I mean fish are really hard to
catch, but you, I can't get rid of.\\
309 - Can't get rid of me?\\
310 - I can't get rid of
you from my heart.\\
311 - You see what happens
when you come fishing.\\
312 - Okay, so there's
one thing I don't get.\\
313 - If nobody was after us all day,\\
314 - then why did the Feds
send a spy vacuum?\\
315 - Why don't you
call them up and ask?\\
316 - - That's a good idea.
- No!\\
317 - You don't get to
touch that any more.\\
318 - Okay. So, Hyde,
first day without Jackie.\\
319 - Not a good start, huh?\\
320 - Are you kidding man? I haven't
burned out this hard in years.\\
321 - I'd do it all again tomorrow
but I'm exhausted.\\
322 - I might have to go back to work.\\
323 - Look at our brave little boy
hiding his sadness behind bluster.\\
324 - Don't worry, I'm sure Jackie's
just as miserable as you are.\\
325 - Oh, I feel so good.\\
326 - This is so much better than staying
home all day, crying about Steven.\\
327 - - You were a total badass.
- I'm not afraid of anything.\\
328 - Oh, my God!\\
329 - Oh, my God, there was
a pack of wild dogs loose.\\
330 - I had to climb to the top of this
giant thing to get away from them.\\
331 - That was me.\\
332 - Dogs, huh?\\
333 - What did you do?\\
334 - Nothing. We... Kelso
thought there was a death ray,\\
335 - so we called the White house,
and the Feds came, but...\\
336 - It was just a vacuum.\\
337 - Okay, I'm cutting you guys
off. Where's your stash?\\
338 - It's all gone, man.
\subsection {Episode 14: Street Fighting Man}
1 - You guys, guess what all of us
are doing on Sunday afternoon?\\
2 - Uh...\\
3 - I hope it's not
going antiquing again.\\
4 - I told you, Donna, that's
just for girls.\\
5 - Loved it. Definitely in.\\
6 - No, during my radio show,\\
7 - we did a promotion where the tenth caller
gets six tickets to the Packers game.\\
8 - And since I turned off all the outside
phone lines after caller number nine,\\
9 - I was caller number ten! We're
going to the Packers game!\\
10 - Oh!\\
11 - Awesome! We got six tickets
and there's six of us!\\
12 - No, wait.
One, two, three... Wait.\\
13 - Fez, stop moving around.
You're confusing me.\\
14 - Wait, wait, wait. So we're all
gonna go to the game together?\\
15 - Oh, what? You won't go now
'cause you and Hyde are broken up?\\
16 - Well, I guess you'd rather stay here
and make sweet, short love to me.\\
17 - No, no, no, I'm fine with going\\
18 - because I'm the one
who did the breaking up.\\
19 - Steven is the one
who's all devastated.\\
20 - So why don't you go
make sweet, short love to him?\\
21 - Um, I think something
got messed up here.\\
22 - Well, I'm going
because I'm fine.\\
23 - Well, good, 'cause I'm fine,
too. In fact, I'm superfine.\\
24 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm
the one who's superfine here.\\
25 - All right. I got the T-shirt
that says so.\\
26 - Well, you also have a T-shirt
that says, "I'm with stupid,"\\
27 - and the arrow is
pointing straight up.\\
28 - Yeah, I hate that T-shirt. It
doesn't even make any sense.\\
29 - Who's above me?\\
30 - Okay, I hate to say it,
you guys,\\
31 - but I think one of these
tickets has to go to my dad.\\
32 - So that means one of us
has to sit this out. Let me see.\\
33 - Eenie, meenie, miney, Kelso.\\
34 - What? How could you
choose your dad over me?\\
35 - Look, my dad is
a huge Packers fan,\\
36 - and he's never
even been to a game.\\
37 - Forman, it's not a problem.
We can all go.\\
38 - Me, Kelso and Fez will do
the old ticket stub switch.\\
39 - That sounds dirty.\\
40 - Well, it's not.\\
41 - I'll do it anyway.\\
42 - What exactly sounds dirty
about "ticket stub switch"?\\
43 - Oh, come on.\\
44 - "Stub, switch."\\
45 - What are you, frigid?\\
46 - Hey, Dad, say, could you give
me a ride this Sunday afternoon at,\\
47 - I don't know, 1:00?\\
48 - Eric, this is football season.\\
49 - I know this doesn't
mean much to you\\
50 - since there are no flying men
with capes involved,\\
51 - but I can't drive you anywhere
on Sunday until the spring.\\
52 - And then your mother can do it.\\
53 - Well, what if it was a ride
to legendary Lambeau Field,\\
54 - where the Packers
are playing the Bears,\\
55 - and where you will be sitting
next to me on the 50-yard line?\\
56 - Eric.\\
57 - What do you say, Dad?
This'll be great, huh?\\
58 - Honey, are you crying?\\
59 - No.\\
60 - Hanging out\\
61 - Down the street\\
62 - The same old thing\\
63 - We did last week\\
64 - Not a thing to do\\
65 - But talk to you\\
66 - We're all all right\\
67 - We're all all right\\
68 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
69 - See this young man here?
That's my boy.\\
70 - And he invited me
to come and see this game.\\
71 - I did that.\\
72 - That was me.\\
73 - Man, I can't go in there.
I got all that stuff.\\
74 - Okay, listen, here's the plan.\\
75 - We've got two tickets
and there's three of us.\\
76 - So I'm gonna go inside
with one of you guys.\\
77 - The guy who comes inside with me,
takes two stubs, comes back outside,\\
78 - brings inside the guy who's
waiting outside. You got it?\\
79 - Why can't you wait outside?\\
80 - Yeah, why can't you?\\
81 - Because I have a ticket.\\
82 - - Oh, that makes sense.
- Okay, yeah.\\
83 - Okay, now, to see
who's coming in with me,\\
84 - instead of drawing straws,
we'll draw tickets, okay?\\
85 - So, Kelso, you go first.\\
86 - All right, I got one.\\
87 - Damn!\\
88 - Well, at least it was fair.\\
89 - Jackie, are you sure you're
okay being here with Hyde?\\
90 - Because I don't want you
to be sad the whole night.\\
91 - I have a feeling I'm gonna miss
a lot of this game if you're sad.\\
92 - Donna, please, okay? I'm past
the sad stage in the breakup.\\
93 - Now I just want to
make someone pay.\\
94 - Like when your uncle died
and you were sad,\\
95 - so you hurt people
by firing your maid?\\
96 - Okay, Donna, breaking up with Steven
was the hardest thing I ever had to do.\\
97 - I gave him my heart
and he stomped on it.\\
98 - I can't pretend
everything's okay.\\
99 - Oh, and we didn't fire Martina.\\
100 - We called immigration
and had them take care of it.\\
101 - Thanks again for inviting me
over for the game, Kitty.\\
102 - Well, it'll be fun.\\
103 - Red never lets me watch the game
because one time, seven years ago,\\
104 - the Packers won at the last
minute while I was in the kitchen.\\
105 - Now I have to sit in the
kitchen every freaking Sunday.\\
106 - Okay, Kitty, I need the Packers
to win by more than seven.\\
107 - I got a Hunsky riding on it.\\
108 - We call them
Hungarians now, Bob.\\
109 - No, I bet $100.\\
110 - - Hey, you want in for $10?
- Yes, please.\\
111 - Oh, I feel like
a gangster's wife.\\
112 - Ooh, how about
I get you some pretzels?\\
113 - I don't want to be any trouble.\\
114 - Oh, it's no trouble at all.\\
115 - No, you didn't let me finish.\\
116 - I don't want to be any trouble,
but I'm gonna need something hot.\\
117 - Maybe something with refried
beans and a little cheese drizzled on it.\\
118 - Go!\\
119 - Man, you put a little schnapps
in the hot chocolate.\\
120 - Eh, more like, I put a little
hot chocolate in the schnapps.\\
121 - You kids talking about booze?
Well, schnapp it over here.\\
122 - Eric, I think your dad's been
body-snatched by a nice guy.\\
123 - I know. When the Packers got a
first down, he actually hugged me.\\
124 - It was like... It was like, warm,
like I imagined it might be.\\
125 - Hey, Kelso, go bring in Fez
now. You know the plan, right?\\
126 - Take my stub and your stub,
and bring him in.\\
127 - I got it, Hyde.
Jeez, I'm not two, you know.\\
128 - Uh, what do I do if I get lost?\\
129 - Dude, you're a cop.\\
130 - Yeah, what good is
shooting somebody if I'm lost?\\
131 - You know, Hyde, you're no help.\\
132 - This is what
it's all about, huh?\\
133 - Spending time out here, us men.\\
134 - Eric, you should be wearing a
jersey. Here, go buy yourself one.\\
135 - Whoa. Dad, thank you.\\
136 - Eric, please,
only on first downs.\\
137 - Wow, you actually
got food for everybody?\\
138 - How unnaturally
thoughtful of you.\\
139 - Oh, don't worry.
I have an ulterior motive.\\
140 - See, I got Steven caramel corn,\\
141 - but Steven doesn't like
caramel corn.\\
142 - And he knows I know
he doesn't like caramel corn,\\
143 - but I'm gonna give it
to him anyway.\\
144 - - Wicked.
- Yeah.\\
145 - Okay, boys, I got you all
your favorite snacks.\\
146 - Red, I got you a hot dog.\\
147 - Donna, I got you three hot dogs.\\
148 - And, Steven,
I got you caramel corn.\\
149 - - I don't like caramel corn.
- Oh, my.\\
150 - Well, if I was
still your girlfriend\\
151 - and not just someone you couldn't
see a future with, I might care.\\
152 - But I'm not, so I don't.
Buh-burn!\\
153 - Hey, Red, want to trade that
hot dog for the caramel corn?\\
154 - Yeah, sure. I don't care.\\
155 - Damn.
I forgot about tradesies.\\
156 - Now, I could have sworn
there was some refried beans\\
157 - right here behind
my emergency bourbon.\\
158 - Kitty, the game's on.\\
159 - I'll dip the chips in Crisco,
whatever you got.\\
160 - - Oh, jeez.
- I got you.\\
161 - I wasn't falling, Bob.\\
162 - Oh.\\
163 - Well, then this is awkward.\\
164 - You can let go now, Bob.\\
165 - - Where's Kelso?
- Outside, of course.\\
166 - Why?\\
167 - Um, we don't have
enough tickets.\\
168 - How can you not get this?\\
169 - Moron, how many ticket stubs
do you have on you?\\
170 - I have two, mine and yours,
which, and try to keep up,\\
171 - is why he's outside
and we're inside.\\
172 - Okay, good.\\
173 - Now go take both ticket stubs
and bring Kelso in.\\
174 - But then how would you
get into the game?\\
175 - I'm already in the game!
Now go!\\
176 - Okay, okay. But you catch
more flies with honey.\\
177 - Jackie wants to know\\
178 - if you could take a picture of
her having the best day of her life.\\
179 - Is she insane?\\
180 - Of course.
What are you, new here?\\
181 - Okay, Steven, now that I'm single, I
am very, very attractive to other men.\\
182 - And I don't want to make you
miserable or anything,\\
183 - but I think I'm gonna start dating
one of those big, stinky football fans.\\
184 - - I'm single.
- No, not you, cheesehead.\\
185 - I mean, whoo, cheesehead!\\
186 - Forget it. Ugh!\\
187 - Why isn't this working?
What is wrong with me?\\
188 - I don't know.\\
189 - You don't have that normal
Jackie thing that you usually have.\\
190 - You know, most of the time
when you put your mind to it,\\
191 - you can really hurt someone.\\
192 - Okay, do you remember
Ashley Caldwell\\
193 - when she was talking about you
behind your back?\\
194 - And then you told
all the other cheerleaders\\
195 - the reason that she couldn't do a
split is because she had a wiener?\\
196 - Well, yeah, but, Donna, that was
easy. I really wanted to hurt her.\\
197 - And you don't really
want to hurt Hyde?\\
198 - Because you still love him?\\
199 - Hey, some jerk's
wearing a Bears jersey.\\
200 - - Let's all get together
and kick his ass.
Yeah!\\
201 - Man, all these guys are pissed off at
something, huh, Dad?\\
202 - "Dad"?
Who is this guy?\\
203 - - Bears, boo!
- Boo!\\
204 - Eric, how the hell can you wear
a Bears jersey at a Packer game?\\
205 - Okay, maybe he doesn't
understand why it's wrong.\\
206 - Let me tell you in a way
how you can understand.\\
207 - The Packers are like the Jedi,\\
208 - and you're wearing
a "Go Darth Vader" jersey.\\
209 - Donna, that's ridiculous.
The Jedi don't play football.\\
210 - They play Manuku.\\
211 - Forman, this is worse
than when you wore\\
212 - the Air Supply T-shirt
to the Aerosmith concert.\\
213 - For God sakes, will you
just take the damn jersey off?\\
214 - No. You know what? I like
rooting for the underdog, okay?\\
215 - I am the underdog in real life.\\
216 - I like Charlie Brown. I like
The Little Engine That Could.\\
217 - I like the Bears.\\
218 - Excuse me, excuse me.\\
219 - Hey, I'm back.\\
220 - Um, where's Fez?\\
221 - Oh, I left him outside
like we always do.\\
222 - But I like how you made him
come in and out\\
223 - just to make him think
we weren't screwing with him.\\
224 - Burn!\\
225 - Kelso, we're not trying
to burn Fez.\\
226 - We're just trying to
all watch the game together.\\
227 - Okay, this is Kelso
you're talking to here.\\
228 - All right, who's getting
burned? Is it me?\\
229 - Because if it is,
I'll just let it happen.\\
230 - No. No one's getting burned.
Now go out and get Fez.\\
231 - All right, fine.\\
232 - I'll go get Fez,
and you can just surprise me.\\
233 - Okay, Steven,\\
234 - certain people have implied that
I might still have feelings for you.\\
235 - But I want you to know
that I don't.\\
236 - In fact, now that I'm single, I
realize how big of a loser you are,\\
237 - and I'm lucky to be rid of you.\\
238 - So I'm gonna go and celebrate with
a giant gold-and-green cotton candy.\\
239 - Man, what the hell
is her problem?\\
240 - She's ruining the football game.\\
241 - I'm gonna go tell her where
she can stick that cotton candy.\\
242 - This is a very
angry section we're in.\\
243 - Very angry.\\
244 - Oh, it's not that bad. I mean, I've
been wearing this jersey 10 minutes\\
245 - and nothing that bad
has happened.\\
246 - Although, I did
just sit in nachos.\\
247 - Good one, Red.\\
248 - All right, Kitty, I think we need to talk
about what happened in the kitchen.\\
249 - Yeah, what the heck
were you doing, Bob?\\
250 - I haven't been goosed like
that since we won the war.\\
251 - I thought you were falling.\\
252 - I wasn't falling. Why would
you think I was falling?\\
253 - You said "Oh, jeez,"\\
254 - and that's what I say when
I'm gonna fall. Oh, jeez.\\
255 - I just said that because I couldn't
find your damn refried beans.\\
256 - - And both hands, Bob?
- I needed leverage.\\
257 - Well, all I know is
we have to keep this a secret.\\
258 - If Red finds out,
he'll cut your hands off.\\
259 - Fine. We won't say
another word about it.\\
260 - Although, about it,
may I say, bravo.\\
261 - Jane Fonda.\\
262 - Hey, what happened with Jackie?\\
263 - Huh?\\
264 - Oh, nothing.
I didn't find her.\\
265 - You might want to go look for
her, though, by the snack bar,\\
266 - behind the pillar, concourse A.\\
267 - Is that close to
the ice cream guy?\\
268 - I think so.\\
269 - All right, I'll go.\\
270 - Hyde, we need help.\\
271 - This whole ticket thing
is like calculus to us.\\
272 - Okay, Kelso is outside
with two ticket stubs.\\
273 - What?\\
274 - How did you get in?\\
275 - Oh, there's a hole in the fence.\\
276 - Come on.\\
277 - Well, the Bears have pretty much
lost the game, so why don't you get lost?\\
278 - Look, I think
you've made your point.\\
279 - Yes, he's wearing a Bears
jersey, but he's my son.\\
280 - Son or daughter?\\
281 - All right, that's enough.\\
282 - No, you know what? You can say
anything you want about me, okay?\\
283 - It's not gonna bother me.\\
284 - Yeah, stay out of this, baldy.\\
285 - Okay, you can shut up
about my dad.\\
286 - Oh, well, who's gonna make me?\\
287 - I am.\\
288 - No, wait, I am.\\
289 - Eric's in a fight.\\
290 - No one's here.
No one's gonna believe me.\\
291 - Why didn't I bring my camera?\\
292 - Today was a miserable day.\\
293 - Now I want to hire Martina
back just so I can fire her again.\\
294 - You know what might
make you feel better?\\
295 - If you go wait in the car while I
go watch the rest of the game.\\
296 - No, that's okay.
You can come with me.\\
297 - Great.\\
298 - I'm vicious, all right!\\
299 - I will tear that ass up!\\
300 - Look at him go.
He's got the Forman rage.\\
301 - Get off of me.\\
302 - Come on. Let's go tell
your mom about our day.\\
303 - Oh, hey, where'd you learn all
those fighting moves, by the way?\\
304 - Spider-Man.\\
305 - I had to ask.\\
306 - Hey, Donna, you know, Fez and I
are free if you want tickets to a movie.\\
307 - Sure. But I only have enough
money for, like, two tickets.\\
308 - No problem.
I know this thing we can do.\\
309 - First, you take two tickets
and go inside,\\
310 - and then we wait outside
and sneak through the fence.\\
311 - Sounds foolproof.\\
312 - We are gonna burn Fez so bad.\\
313 - Well, this sucks.\\
314 - 'Cause before we'd just,
kind of, hang out, you know?\\
315 - Yeah. Well, that was before.\\
316 - Obviously, hanging out
doesn't work so well now.\\
317 - Yeah.\\
318 - - Want me to give
you a ride home?
- No, that's okay.\\
319 - I don't mind.\\
320 - No, I'll walk.\\
321 - But thank you.\\
322 - I can't believe you sat on my
couch with cheese on your pants.\\
323 - Okay, listen, Mom, cheese on
my pants is just who I am now.\\
324 - No more spending time
with your father.\\
325 - He's turned you into an animal.\\
326 - I can't believe
you got into a fight.\\
327 - You know, I'm thinking about
becoming a boxer.\\
328 - They may have to invent
a whole new weight class.\\
329 - Hey, what's lighter
than a feather?\\
330 - A Packer win, and the boy
defends the family name.\\
331 - This is a great day
for the Formans.\\
332 - I touched your wife's butt.\\
333 - I made $10.
\subsection {Episode 15: It's All Over Now}
1 - Hey, Sarah, when you and
Donna are alone at the radio station,\\
2 - do you ever pretend that instead
of being just a regular intern,\\
3 - that you're, like,
a super naughty intern?\\
4 - Oh, and that Donna has to
teach you a very naked lesson?\\
5 - I'll give you 10 bucks and what's
left of my hot dog to say yes.\\
6 - No, sillies. There's way too much
work to do at the station to daydream.\\
7 - I mean, I have to take
my top off and sort records,\\
8 - and then Donna and I have
to French-kiss. It's exhausting.\\
9 - This is why there should be
more women in the workforce.\\
10 - Um, please don't take this
the wrong way,\\
11 - but I want to have sex with you.\\
12 - Sarah's only been
interning for a week,\\
13 - but the deejays have already
let her talk on the air,\\
14 - and they gave her a really
cool nickname, Sizzling Sarah.\\
15 - - Oh, that's terrific.
- That's onomatopoeia.\\
16 - - That's good.
- It rhymes.\\
17 - It is so fun.\\
18 - Everyone at the station's been
super nice, especially the older men.\\
19 - Excuse me. I'll be right back.\\
20 - - This girl is great.
- This girl is great.\\
21 - That girl is a bitch.\\
22 - She's Sizzling Sarah
in one week?\\
23 - It took me six months of sorting
records to become Hot Donna.\\
24 - Six months.\\
25 - Uh, no, actually, you've been
Hot Donna since the fifth grade\\
26 - when you started cultivating
that melon patch.\\
27 - Don't tell her about the melon
patch. Now she knows our secret code.\\
28 - Sizzling Sarah.\\
29 - I don't even know why they
hired her. She's music illiterate.\\
30 - When I asked her if she liked The Police,
she was like, "No, I prefer firemen."\\
31 - Donna, who cares
if she knows about music?\\
32 - The girl is freaking hot.\\
33 - Yeah, Donna, what you've yet to
realize is that life is a beauty contest.\\
34 - I mean, you got your job
because you're hot,\\
35 - and now a new hot girl is
coming and taking your place.\\
36 - It's survival of the juggiest.\\
37 - No, I got my job
because I know music.\\
38 - Yeah, that's why your on-air
nickname is "Music-knowing Donna."\\
39 - Look, Donna, your problem is
you've got too much going on.\\
40 - I mean, the less you have going
on, the less you have to worry about.\\
41 - Look at me. I've got nothing going
on and I've got nothing to worry about.\\
42 - Except your future.\\
43 - Eh.\\
44 - How's it going?\\
45 - - Horrible, I want you back.
- Thank God, I want you back.\\
46 - - In fact, marry me.
- Oh, yes, Steven!\\
47 - Do you, Jackie?\\
48 - - I do!
- Me, too!\\
49 - Yeah, baby!\\
50 - Jackie, I said, how's it going?\\
51 - Fine.\\
52 - Everything's fine.\\
53 - You guys, while I was
in the bathroom,\\
54 - I realized I totally forgot
to wear a bra today.\\
55 - I love you.\\
56 - Hanging out\\
57 - Down the street\\
58 - The same old thing\\
59 - We did last week\\
60 - Not a thing to do\\
61 - But talk to you\\
62 - We're all all right\\
63 - We're all all right\\
64 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
65 - Steven, I've noticed\\
66 - that every day you come home
from the record store tired and irritable,\\
67 - and I just want to say,
"Welcome to life."\\
68 - So, what's new
in the world of rock 'n' roll?\\
69 - 'Cause this cool cat wants the
skinny on the bebop, maestro.\\
70 - Uh, well, tomorrow we have Tom Jones coming
in for a record signing at the store.\\
71 - Tom Jones! I love him!\\
72 - Oh, and the way he
shakes his hips.\\
73 - It just... It makes me feel
all nervous and embarrassed.\\
74 - Boy, that sounds like fun.\\
75 - Fun for you, maybe.
You're a middle-aged woman.\\
76 - What?\\
77 - Don't "what" me.\\
78 - The average lifespan is 72,
so if you're older than 36,\\
79 - which you are, then, by
definition, you're middle-aged.\\
80 - Discussion over.\\
81 - Okay, when you're right,
you're right.\\
82 - Wow.\\
83 - I win an argument
every six years or so.\\
84 - Is Steven here?\\
85 - I'm only asking to make sure he's
not in case he still has feelings for me.\\
86 - Well, he's not here.\\
87 - He went to a bar to forget
how much he loves you.\\
88 - Really?\\
89 - Uh, no, he's at the car wash.\\
90 - - You guys wanna
hear something sick?
- Ooh, yes. Please, hurry.\\
91 - Mr. Randall,
down at the radio station,\\
92 - wants me to host a live remote
from Hyde's record store\\
93 - when Tom Jones is there.\\
94 - And to promote it, they want to
put me on a billboard wearing this.\\
95 - That's just good radio.\\
96 - Well, I'm not wearing it.\\
97 - I should be valued for my voice
and music knowledge, not my body,\\
98 - no matter how smoking it is.\\
99 - There you go again with your\\
100 - "women should be valued
for their minds" gobbledygook.\\
101 - Donna, women should be
valued for their looks.\\
102 - Men should be
valued for their cars,\\
103 - and foreigners should be
valued for their ability to sweep.\\
104 - Hey, hey.\\
105 - We also drive a mean taxi.\\
106 - I'm not caving to
their smutty demands.\\
107 - I am an on-air personality.
I am not a sex kitten.\\
108 - I agree, Donna.\\
109 - Making you wear that outfit
is demeaning to women.\\
110 - Well, thank you, Fez.\\
111 - But, just to be sure,
put it on and shake your ass.\\
112 - Would you please quit giggling?\\
113 - Sorry, man. I'm listening
to George Carlin's\\
114 - Seven Dirty Words You Can't
Say on Radio and Television.\\
115 - Man, he just keeps saying them
over and over again.\\
116 - Potty mouth.\\
117 - Okay, Tom Jones is booked
and everything is set.\\
118 - You know, I don't think
there's anything more exciting\\
119 - than a promotional
event gone right.\\
120 - Then you need to get drunk
and ride a mechanical bull.\\
121 - You know, you're being
more of a tool than usual.\\
122 - Have you talked to Jackie?\\
123 - No, Angie. What do
I have to say to Jackie?\\
124 - That you love her and miss her.\\
125 - I don't love people.\\
126 - I love Camaros, Zeppelin
and french fries, in that order.\\
127 - You guys, I just had
this brilliant idea.\\
128 - You know how every dirty word
has a number?\\
129 - Instead of cursing, you could
just say that number.\\
130 - Like I could say,
"Hi, go three yourself."\\
131 - Hey, Angie,
when Tom Jones gets here,\\
132 - you're not gonna throw your
underpants at him, are you?\\
133 - Michael, you know
I don't wear underwear.\\
134 - Come on, man, you're my sister.\\
135 - I just told her to say that
to gross you out. Burn!\\
136 - Yeah, you got me.\\
137 - Besides, I happen to know
that she does wear underwear.\\
138 - Sometimes she lets me take
them off for her. Boomerang burn!\\
139 - I feel terrible.\\
140 - I think it's the flu.\\
141 - Okay, now is this the real flu or the
Martini & Rossi Asti Spumante flu?\\
142 - Now I'm gonna miss
Tom Jones this afternoon,\\
143 - and I wanted his
autograph so badly.\\
144 - - Red, I was thinking maybe...
- No.\\
145 - You know, if you were sick and
Joe DiMaggio was signing footballs,\\
146 - I'd get an autograph for you.\\
147 - Mom, Joe DiMaggio
played baseball.\\
148 - That'd be like me saying
G.I. Joe has a karate grip.\\
149 - What a nerd I'd be.\\
150 - - Hey, Fez, I need your advice.
- You should show more leg.\\
151 - I'm serious.\\
152 - I still love Steven and I want him
back. Everything reminds me of him.\\
153 - Every time I walk past a pile
of dirty laundry, I start crying.\\
154 - Then you should go to him
and tell him how you feel.\\
155 - No, I cannot go up to Steven
and pour my heart out to him\\
156 - if I'm not sure he
feels the same way.\\
157 - I couldn't take the rejection.\\
158 - Oh, please, I've been
rejected a million times.\\
159 - And trust me, after the first 100 or
so, they don't sting no more, baby.\\
160 - I wouldn't even know
what to say.\\
161 - Okay, let's role-play.\\
162 - Pretend I'm Hyde and say everything
you want to say to him to me.\\
163 - Really? Okay.\\
164 - Steven, I love you
and I want you back.\\
165 - I never thought I would hear
those words, my darling.\\
166 - Ew!\\
167 - I'm sorry, I got
a little carried away.\\
168 - I'll be serious
this time, I promise.\\
169 - Okay.\\
170 - I love you and all I want
is for us to be together.\\
171 - - Get off me, weirdo.
- I'm the weirdo?\\
172 - You're the one saying, "I love
you," smack! "I love you," smack!\\
173 - You little tease.\\
174 - So, you see, Mr. Randall, I don't think
it's necessary for me to wear a bikini.\\
175 - I mean, what is sexier
than a little bit of mystery?\\
176 - Well, according to
my research, naked boobies.\\
177 - All right, look,
ratings are down,\\
178 - and I think this
could really help.\\
179 - Well, I'm not gonna strip
for a radio advertisement.\\
180 - - It's demeaning.
- I'll do it.\\
181 - You will?\\
182 - Yeah, of course she'll do it.
This whole billboard was her idea.\\
183 - What?\\
184 - Unlike some people, I care
about this radio station.\\
185 - Plus, I just love
wearing a bikini.\\
186 - When I put one on,
I jiggle just like jelly.\\
187 - Well, she jiggles just like two
perfectly filled water balloons,\\
188 - but I'm afraid you'll never
get to see them, or touch them,\\
189 - or make a motorboat sound
with your mouth between them,\\
190 - because she is a lady!\\
191 - Sarah, you knew
that I would never do this.\\
192 - You were just trying
to make me look bad.\\
193 - And it's working.\\
194 - You're fired.\\
195 - Wait, you're firing me
because I won't strip?\\
196 - No, no, you know what?\\
197 - I'm a gentleman, and I normally
don't use this kind of language.\\
198 - But, Mr. Randall, you are one
sixing, sevening monkey-fiver.\\
199 - You think your one don't stink?\\
200 - Well, three off, you
threeing three. Come on.\\
201 - Ladies, ladies, I realize Tom Jones is
late, and I have an announcement to make.\\
202 - Shut up!\\
203 - Holy crap.\\
204 - It's like a water
buffalo convention.\\
205 - I'm not waiting two hours
for a lousy autograph.\\
206 - Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse
me. Sorry, watch your feet.\\
207 - Excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me there, buddy.\\
208 - Hey, no cutsies.\\
209 - Oh, hell,
I don't need Tom Jones.\\
210 - I'll sign the damn album myself.\\
211 - Excuse me.\\
212 - Who pinched my behind?\\
213 - Bonnie!\\
214 - Your husband hasn't even
been dead two months.\\
215 - I am freaking pissed.\\
216 - Sarah puts on a bikini,
and whammo, she gets me fired?\\
217 - That little bimbo set this whole
thing up and I am freaking pissed!\\
218 - Well, see what happens when you try
to skate through life using your brain?\\
219 - For the millionth time,
people, it's all about the looks!\\
220 - Well, I refuse to trade on my
good looks to achieve success.\\
221 - Eric Forman
don't play that game.\\
222 - Well, I'm not gonna
let her get away with this.\\
223 - I need to think of
a way to get even.\\
224 - All right, you need to do something
brilliant, that's subtle but clever.\\
225 - Hit her in the face
with a Wiffle ball bat.\\
226 - Um, I don't think that's
exactly what I'm looking for.\\
227 - Okay, well, then, you've
obviously never been hit in the face\\
228 - with a Wiffle ball bat.\\
229 - Wait a second.\\
230 - Sarah's gonna be broadcasting
live from the record store, right?\\
231 - - Yeah.
- Okay, then I got
an awesome idea.\\
232 - Well, if it's hitting her in
the face with a Wiffle ball bat,\\
233 - you stole that from me.\\
234 - Here it is, Kitty,
a signed Tom Jones album.\\
235 - Oh! Aw!\\
236 - Oh, thank you.\\
237 - Oh, I hope he wasn't upset
I couldn't be there myself.\\
238 - Did you tell him I had the flu?\\
239 - Didn't come up.\\
240 - Well, what did you talk about?\\
241 - Fishing.\\
242 - Tom Jones fishes?\\
243 - Yeah, it's surprising, I know.\\
244 - I'm so surprised that I'm gonna
go upstairs and take a nap.\\
245 - This is Sizzling Sarah
at Grooves record store,\\
246 - coming at you live,
without a bra.\\
247 - And up next some music
from a band.\\
248 - - That's great.
- Okay.\\
249 - I was thinking now would be
a good time to put a bikini on.\\
250 - Fortunately, I keep
a box of them in my car.\\
251 - Come on.\\
252 - Tom is two hours late.\\
253 - These women are gonna
rip this place apart.\\
254 - We've gotta think of some way
to distract them.\\
255 - What do you want me to do,
throw a ham at them?\\
256 - All right, all right,
you should throw me at them.\\
257 - I'll give these ladies what
they're not getting at home.\\
258 - Okay, there's Hyde.\\
259 - Go and tell him
you want him back.\\
260 - I can't.\\
261 - I mean, if I knew he loved me, I'd
be happy to put myself out there.\\
262 - But I don't, and if he
doesn't, I'll just feel so stupid.\\
263 - Okay, just go to him and say,
"Steven, I want to talk about us."\\
264 - And if he wants to talk,
then he wants you back.\\
265 - But if he blows you off, then you
tested the water, and the water...\\
266 - Well, the water
doesn't love you.\\
267 - All right, here I go.\\
268 - Hey, um, Steven,
can we talk about us?\\
269 - Us? Who has time
to talk about us?\\
270 - Oh, lady, you're not at home.
Put your shoes back on.\\
271 - He didn't even
want to talk to me.\\
272 - Am I so disgusting?\\
273 - Apparently to him.\\
274 - Eric, are you sure
this is gonna work?\\
275 - Donna, let's just say when
we're done with Sizzling Sarah,\\
276 - her new nickname's gonna be
"Crying, No-job, Street Prostitute Sarah."\\
277 - Hi, Sarah.\\
278 - Hi, I just wanted to thank you
for getting me fired.\\
279 - I realize now that my feminist
ideals are just a bunch of hooey,\\
280 - and I should use my brains
less and my body more.\\
281 - Yeah, I don't know why women
are given brains in the first place.\\
282 - Anyway, Mr. Randall felt bad for
me so he hired me back as an intern,\\
283 - and he wants you to play this
after the commercial, track six.\\
284 - You know, Donna,
you and I are a lot alike.\\
285 - Well, except I'm on the radio
and you're not.\\
286 - Steven, Tom Jones is stuck in
a snowstorm. He's not coming.\\
287 - These women will riot.\\
288 - Yeah, when middle-aged women
get mad, they get super pissed.\\
289 - 'Cause they got nothing to
lose. They're almost dead.\\
290 - Which is why we should have
somebody else break the news.\\
291 - Hey, Fez, you want
to meet some ladies?\\
292 - Yeah.\\
293 - Okay, I've just been handed
a hot, new record.\\
294 - So here's George Carlin\\
295 - with The Seven Dirty Words You
Can't Say on Television or Radio.\\
296 - Huh.\\
297 - It seems like I almost
shouldn't play it.\\
298 - Oh, well.\\
299 - Eric, thank you so much.
That was a great idea.\\
300 - You're welcome. Now let's
go home and five all night.\\
301 - So, Steven, how was Tom Jones?\\
302 - Who knows?
He never even...\\
303 - Wanted to leave.\\
304 - You know, Tom loves his fans.\\
305 - I was just telling Kitty how I had to chase
down his limo to get her an autograph.\\
306 - Mrs. Forman, it was fantastic.\\
307 - You should have seen Red running after
Tom's limo, screaming like a little girl.\\
308 - - "Tom! Tom!"
- All right, all right.\\
309 - That's enough bragging.\\
310 - Well, and that is why
I am making this meatball hero\\
311 - for my meaty hero of a husband.\\
312 - Hiya, Red.\\
313 - You were smart
not to stick around.\\
314 - I waited five hours.
Tom Jones never showed up.\\
315 - Never showed up?\\
316 - If Tom Jones never showed up,
who signed this autograph?\\
317 - I can't lie to you.\\
318 - It was Julio Iglesias.\\
319 - Those women at the record store flipped
when they heard the seven dirty words,\\
320 - especially word number four.\\
321 - They do not like
word number four.\\
322 - It was awesome, man.
Sarah got fired.\\
323 - The station manager got in
trouble, and Donna got her job back.\\
324 - I'm telling you, if I weren't
unemployed and living with my mommy,\\
325 - I'd be wickedly cool.\\
326 - Well, if you'd have hit somebody
in the face with a Wiffle ball bat,\\
327 - this would have
been over hours ago.\\
328 - Okay, not only did I get my
job back, but I had conditions.\\
329 - I told Mr. Randall I'd be fully
clothed at all times, and he said okay.\\
330 - I told him to stop demeaning
women, and he said okay.\\
331 - And I told him to respect me for my
mind and my ideas and not my looks,\\
332 - and he said okay.\\
333 - So do you want people
to stop calling you Hot Donna?\\
334 - No, that makes me feel pretty.\\
335 - Donna, you whore,
you got me fired.\\
336 - Wait, you're the one
who got me fired first.\\
337 - Well, I am so mad,
I'm gonna make out with Fez.\\
338 - Well, if you're gonna make out
with Fez, then so am I.\\
339 - No, sleep. Damn you, sleep.
\subsection {Episode 16: On with the Show}
1 - Hey, Fez, you know what was
awesome? That time you rode that tree.\\
2 - How did he ride a tree?\\
3 - Oh, he climbed it,
Kelso cut it down.\\
4 - You guys have a million stories.\\
5 - And you know each other so well.
It's like you have your own language.\\
6 - I don't even understand
half the things you say.\\
7 - If you understand anything that
Fez says, you're the only one. Burn!\\
8 - Oh, Kelso can't understand me?\\
9 - Now I know how it feels
to be a book. Oh, burn!\\
10 - See? Man, I wanna burn somebody
so I can be part of the gang.\\
11 - This gang?\\
12 - Angie, the only reason
this gang formed\\
13 - was because no one
would let us into their gang.\\
14 - We're like the chess club,\\
15 - but better looking and dumber.\\
16 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
17 - Um, so was there something
you wanted to say to me\\
18 - the other day at
the record store?\\
19 - Oh, yeah. I wanted
to talk to you about Abba.\\
20 - Abba?\\
21 - No, you said you
wanted to talk about us.\\
22 - Right.
Our feelings about Abba.\\
23 - You know what? Good. Great.\\
24 - Believe me, I don't wanna
talk about us, either.\\
25 - Come on, Angie.\\
26 - We were supposed to open the
record store, ooh, about seven hours ago.\\
27 - You told me you
wanted to tell Hyde\\
28 - that you still love him
and you wanted him back.\\
29 - Yeah, well, it's obvious
he doesn't want me back.\\
30 - So you better not tell him
what I said or I'll be humiliated.\\
31 - My lips are a seal's.\\
32 - Wait, don't you mean
that your lips are sealed?\\
33 - I'm not hearing the difference.\\
34 - Great. Anyways, you guys,
I have huge news.\\
35 - You know how Point Place cable
has that public access channel?\\
36 - Yeah. Donna, didn't your dad do,
like, a belly dancing show there?\\
37 - He guest-hosted. Shut up.\\
38 - Anyways, I'm gonna have my own
show, just like Mary Tyler Moore.\\
39 - Oh, except I won't
stop for commercials\\
40 - 'cause no one really wants
to take a break from me.\\
41 - I don't know.
That week you were in Florida,\\
42 - that was a nice, quiet week.\\
43 - Have you been in bed all day?\\
44 - Yeah, I have.\\
45 - I've been reading the Jack
Kerouac classic On The Road.\\
46 - See, as I see it,
why get out of bed\\
47 - when you can read about people
who got out of bed?\\
48 - You have got to be the laziest
non-communist I've ever met.\\
49 - And you are about to read
a book that my foot wrote.\\
50 - It's called On The Road
To In Your Ass.\\
51 - Okay, now, Red, please let's hold
off on the cursing until happy hour.\\
52 - This year-off crap
better come to an end\\
53 - or I'm gonna put you in a box
and mail you to the Marines.\\
54 - Oh, don't worry, honey.\\
55 - Your father's too cheap
to mail something that heavy.\\
56 - He just wants you to have
some direction and so do I.\\
57 - And you are in luck because
I got the new issue of Cosmo.\\
58 - Oh, well, I'm just not sure I need
seven new ways to please my man.\\
59 - No. No. Honey,
it's a job aptitude test.\\
60 - Okay, question number one.\\
61 - "Do you consider
yourself creative?"\\
62 - - Well...
- Yes.\\
63 - You were a little wiz
at macaroni art.\\
64 - "Do you prefer to work alone
or with others?"\\
65 - - Alone.
- Nope, you love people.\\
66 - Okay, question three.
"Do you..." Oh, that's easy.\\
67 - Look, Mom, I'm happy
just enjoying my world.\\
68 - I'm like an explorer. I'm exactly
like Christopher Columbus.\\
69 - Except, you know, I've been
incredibly distracted by television.\\
70 - Okay. All done.\\
71 - Now, according to your answers,\\
72 - you should be a nurse!\\
73 - Hanging out\\
74 - Down the street\\
75 - The same old thing\\
76 - We did last week\\
77 - Not a thing to do\\
78 - But talk to you\\
79 - We're all all right\\
80 - We're all all right\\
81 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
82 - Okay, Fez, since you're
helping me with set dressing,\\
83 - I want the set to reflect
my sparkling personality.\\
84 - I want it to say "Jackie."\\
85 - Okay, let me see. Maybe
some glitter, a disco ball...\\
86 - Uh-huh. I want a big sign
that says "Jackie."\\
87 - I hate this room.\\
88 - It reminds me of my dad
dancing around half-naked\\
89 - with finger cymbals.\\
90 - Well, my show is
gonna be a news show.\\
91 - All-nude or just topless?\\
92 - Not nude, news.\\
93 - I'm not hearing the difference.\\
94 - Jackie, how are you gonna tell people
the news if you don't know any news?\\
95 - Well, I know all the news
that's really important,\\
96 - like, who's got a new car, what
store is having a sale on leggings,\\
97 - and if there'll ever be peace
in the Middle East.\\
98 - Who am I kidding?
No one cares about China.\\
99 - - Hey, Eric, can I have
some of your fries?
- Sure.\\
100 - Well, I don't want any. Burn!\\
101 - I think you're confusing
a burn with just talking.\\
102 - - Eric, can I have some fries?
- Yeah, help yourself.\\
103 - Burn!\\
104 - Yeah, I knew you were gonna
do that, so I spit in them. Burn!\\
105 - Totally.\\
106 - Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You ate his spit. Burn!\\
107 - That's a piggyback burn.
We don't do that.\\
108 - Come on, Angie. You've gotta
do inventory in the storeroom,\\
109 - and I gotta go
sleep behind a box.\\
110 - Man, you want to
catch a movie or something?\\
111 - Nah. I gotta go down
to the police academy.\\
112 - They're gonna teach me
what prisoners feel like.\\
113 - Guys are gonna handcuff me
to a flagpole for a few hours.\\
114 - It's not in the curriculum,
but they say it's required.\\
115 - Hey, uh, I'm sorry, are you reading
the new Mighty Spectaculous?\\
116 - Yeah. You a fan?\\
117 - "When trouble arrives
by car or bus...\\
118 - "...we summon
the Mighty Spectaculous!"\\
119 - - They call me Eric Forman.
- Stew Bailey.\\
120 - No relation to Beetle.\\
121 - Hey, Stew, I mean, if you're interested,
they're having a Spectaculous Spectacular\\
122 - down at
the Atomic Comic Book Nook.\\
123 - You're probably... You probably
have to get back to work or something.\\
124 - I don't have to be anywhere.
I don't have a job.\\
125 - How old are you?\\
126 - Well, let's just say I'm two years
older than Professor Revenge-O.\\
127 - Thirty-six.\\
128 - So then, Stew,
what do you do all day?\\
129 - You're looking at it.\\
130 - We're gonna be good friends.\\
131 - Fez, Jackie's show
is about to start.\\
132 - Aren't you supposed
to be helping her?\\
133 - She asked me to make a giant
sign with her name on it.\\
134 - So I said, "You got it, baby."\\
135 - So then, I went to
get some ice cream,\\
136 - and then I went to play
some Space Invaders,\\
137 - and then I came here
to watch the show.\\
138 - I could never be on TV,
unless it was Johnny Carson,\\
139 - because I have a very funny story
about a Cheeto that looked just like Jesus.\\
140 - So, Fez,\\
141 - you've been hanging out a lot
lately with Jackie.\\
142 - Any idea what she wanted to talk to me
about at the record store the other day?\\
143 - Um, I don't know. I was there.
I mean, I wasn't there.\\
144 - I, uh...\\
145 - I was, uh... I was away.\\
146 - On business.\\
147 - Well, if she wanted
to get back together,\\
148 - that's something
I wouldn't mind knowing.\\
149 - So why don't you just go ahead
and spill the beans?\\
150 - Beans?\\
151 - What beans?\\
152 - The only beans are in your
head, you, uh, little bean-head.\\
153 - Anyway, I opened the bag
and there he was.\\
154 - The beard and everything.\\
155 - Oh, oh, Jackie's about to start.\\
156 - - Okay, Jackie, are you ready?
- Yeah, of course.\\
157 - I've got this thing down pat.\\
158 - Okay, so after
the weather report,\\
159 - I'm gonna get into the problem
with the spirit squad.\\
160 - They're all fat. That's my
commentary. I'm anti-fat.\\
161 - Okay. Ten seconds until you're on
the air, offending thousands of people.\\
162 - Thousands of people?\\
163 - In five, four, three...\\
164 - You didn't say "two" or "one."\\
165 - It's because you're on now.\\
166 - Well, but I'm not...\\
167 - Hi.\\
168 - - I'm Backie Jurkhart.
- Jackie Burkhart.\\
169 - - What?
- It's your name.\\
170 - - I know what my name is.
- You said Backie Jurkhart.\\
171 - Okay, stop talking
or you're fired.\\
172 - Fine. You're on your own.\\
173 - I'm what?\\
174 - Oh, dear.\\
175 - She's not so good.\\
176 - She's sweating
like Muhammad Ali.\\
177 - Cut to her boobs.\\
178 - Who's directing this thing?\\
179 - I guess we can't just sit and
talk about comic books all day.\\
180 - Let's do some
Star Wars trivia. Go.\\
181 - I got a stumper.\\
182 - - Who is Luke and
Obi-Wan's nemesis at...
- Doctor Evazan.\\
183 - Man, you're good.\\
184 - Look, let me ask you a question.\\
185 - Some people think that if I keep
living, you know, "without a purpose,"\\
186 - that I'll be all, I don't
know, unfulfilled and stuff.\\
187 - Do you ever feel unfulfilled?\\
188 - I've seen Star Wars
in seven different states.\\
189 - I even met the midget
that they stuck inside R2-D2.\\
190 - What could be more
fulfilling than that?\\
191 - I don't know.\\
192 - Hey, dorks.\\
193 - Listen, Angie had
a really rough day at work\\
194 - so I'm gonna rub her feet,
and you might wanna clear out\\
195 - before I start
rubbing other stuff.\\
196 - Eric, come over later.
We'll game.\\
197 - Who was that guy?\\
198 - - That's this guy...
- I don't care. Burn!\\
199 - Angie, you're cute as a button,
but you burn like a botard.\\
200 - Look, if you wanna burn someone,\\
201 - you gotta embarrass them
to make other people laugh.\\
202 - You want to combine the
elements of humiliation and surprise.\\
203 - Dude, what the hell?\\
204 - Burn!\\
205 - Oh, hey.
Jackie, I saw your show.\\
206 - It isn't as good as
a lot of other shows.\\
207 - No.\\
208 - It was great for people who
think regular TV is too entertaining.\\
209 - I freaked out.\\
210 - I mean, the cameras turned on,
and I realized I'm completely alone.\\
211 - I'm alone on TV,
and I'm alone in real life.\\
212 - I don't know what I'm gonna do.\\
213 - Burn!\\
214 - Oh, my God!\\
215 - Uh, I forgot to tell you
the part about\\
216 - you don't burn someone
who's already crying.\\
217 - Okay, best sidekick.
Robin or Aqualad?\\
218 - Ooh, uh, toughie.\\
219 - Is the villain they're
fighting terrestrial or aquatic?\\
220 - Stewie, you didn't tell me
you were having a friend over.\\
221 - Eric, this is my mom.\\
222 - You still live with your mom?\\
223 - Oh, she's more than just my
mother. She's my best friend.\\
224 - She's your best friend?\\
225 - Well, you're giving her
a run for her money.\\
226 - - Okay, I gotta go.
- Are you sure?\\
227 - I was about to make sandwiches
in the shape of X-wing fighters.\\
228 - Uh, no, really.
Well... No, I gotta go.\\
229 - - What are you doing?
- I'm throwing out
all my comic books.\\
230 - I saw my future today, and,
well, it's living with its mother.\\
231 - Yeah, well, I saw
my future and it sweats.\\
232 - Okay. Hold on. You sweat?\\
233 - Uh, would you happen to have a picture,
some tape of this that I could laugh at?\\
234 - Eric, I tried to have
my own TV show, and I failed.\\
235 - My life is over. I'm not
good enough to be on TV.\\
236 - No, Jackie.\\
237 - Okay, come on.\\
238 - You're good-looking,\\
239 - you're incredibly superficial
and you lie constantly.\\
240 - I think you're perfect for TV.\\
241 - - Do you really think so?
- Yeah.\\
242 - I mean, jeez, look, at least you're
doing something with your life.\\
243 - I have wasted an entire year.\\
244 - Eric, let me
stop you right there.\\
245 - Okay? Since you were kind enough to
cheer me up when my spirits were low,\\
246 - I'm gonna go. Thanks.\\
247 - Hey, Forman,
let me ask you a question.\\
248 - What do you think
about me and Jackie?\\
249 - Well, man,
you know what I think.\\
250 - I think that Jackie
is evil incarnate.\\
251 - I think that if you were to
cut off one of her hands,\\
252 - it would probably grow back
into another Jackie.\\
253 - Look, before Jackie,\\
254 - you were just some
pissed-off guy in my basement.\\
255 - But with her...\\
256 - I mean, you seemed happy, man.\\
257 - Hey, I was never happy.\\
258 - I was just less pissed off.\\
259 - Hyde,\\
260 - I lied to you when I told you
that I was away on business.\\
261 - No.\\
262 - Yes.\\
263 - And I know what Jackie
wanted to tell you.\\
264 - She still loves you.\\
265 - What?\\
266 - Yeah. She said she was wrong
and that she wanted you back.\\
267 - She was vulnerable,
so I tried to french her.\\
268 - But no-go.\\
269 - - Shouldn't Jackie
be here by now?
- Yeah.\\
270 - She's supposed to go
on in, like, a minute.\\
271 - I don't think
she's gonna show up.\\
272 - What?\\
273 - No, but we were gonna do
this whole segment on sluts.\\
274 - And I was gonna be
the slut expert.\\
275 - That's the only kind of expert
I'm ever gonna be.\\
276 - - Hey.
- Jackie, I can't believe
you showed up.\\
277 - I can't believe I showed up.\\
278 - What am I doing with my life?\\
279 - Okay, come on, people.
We got a show to do.\\
280 - Okay. In three...\\
281 - Hi, I'm Jackie Burkhart, and here's
all the news you need to know.\\
282 - This just in. Slacks are out.\\
283 - So, ladies, shave those legs
and put on a skirt.\\
284 - Up next, senior correspondent
Michael Kelso joins me\\
285 - for a very exciting segment
I like to call Slut or Not.\\
286 - - Michael, welcome.
- Hi, Jackie. Ladies.\\
287 - Okay, let's get started.\\
288 - - Marcy Cavanaugh.
- Slut.\\
289 - Susie Rice.\\
290 - - Slut.
- Mmm.\\
291 - Hey, could you zoom out a sec?\\
292 - Ooh, Jenny Keene.\\
293 - Partly slutty with a chance
of severe sluttiness.\\
294 - - Angie, what the hell?
- Burn?\\
295 - Burn!\\
296 - Well, there you have it,
America, your first televised burn.\\
297 - Up next, a hard-hitting segment
called Girls With Mustaches.\\
298 - Don't touch that dial,
Sherry Papadakis.\\
299 - - Hey, man, is Jackie around?
- Hey.\\
300 - Yeah, but I thought
you weren't talking to her.\\
301 - You're gonna make up
with her, aren't you?\\
302 - Oh, you're gonna tell her
that you love her.\\
303 - And your little sunglasses
are gonna get all fogged up.\\
304 - Jackie, there's
someone here to see you.\\
305 - Hey.\\
306 - Uh, I thought maybe
we could talk for a minute.\\
307 - Is it about my show?
'Cause it was awesome.\\
308 - Steven, I went on and I did
great. And I did it on my own.\\
309 - I mean, I've never been more
proud of myself in my entire life.\\
310 - I'm gonna do great on my own.\\
311 - I'm sorry. What did you
want to talk to me about?\\
312 - Well, um...\\
313 - I just wanted to say
congratulations on your show.\\
314 - - Thank you.
- Yeah.\\
315 - Did you see Michael
with his pants down?\\
316 - No.\\
317 - But I don't need a TV
to see that.\\
318 - Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,\\
319 - and welcome to the full
half-hour of Slut or Not.\\
320 - I've got a phone book here\\
321 - and a wealth of experience
with fooling around,\\
322 - so let's get started.\\
323 - "Beverly Addison."\\
324 - I don't know her personally,
but I've heard she has a tattoo.\\
325 - So congratulations, Beverly
Addison. You are a slut.\\
326 - What the hell happened
to this country?\\
327 - I know Beverly Addison, and
I'm glad somebody finally said it.
\subsection {Episode 17: Down the Road Apiece}
1 - Okay, I don't understand why you're
taking a video camera on a road trip.\\
2 - You should be packing
more sensible items.\\
3 - Like, toilet paper
and your mother.\\
4 - Look, Mom, accept it.
I'm going.\\
5 - Okay, my year off is
now officially over,\\
6 - and I think I've finally
decided on a sensible career\\
7 - that's gonna provide me
with a really stable future.\\
8 - I'm gonna be a traveling
documentary filmmaker.\\
9 - Oh, come on, you made that up.\\
10 - Hey, Kitty, I'm going
ice-skating on a rainbow.\\
11 - Eric, don't listen to him.\\
12 - I have complete confidence
you're gonna be\\
13 - the best traveling
docu-what's-it-who-maker ever.\\
14 - Thank you.\\
15 - Do you have enough money?\\
16 - Mom, I don't need
that much money.\\
17 - I'm sure that
at stops along the way,\\
18 - strangers will just offer me
hot pots of beans\\
19 - in exchange for colorful
stories from the road.\\
20 - Hot pots of beans?\\
21 - What if they're spicy?\\
22 - You can't even chew
cinnamon gum.\\
23 - Okay, that's it. I'm going.\\
24 - Uh, I'll miss you.\\
25 - Well, thank you, sweetie.\\
26 - Um, I think he was
talking to me.\\
27 - He was not.\\
28 - Eric, who were you talking to?\\
29 - Yeah, who?\\
30 - It's times like this
I usually fake chest pains.\\
31 - Uh, I was talking to\\
32 - the prettiest girl in
the driveway, that's who.\\
33 - So, okay, I want you to promise
to call me every night at 9:00.\\
34 - Oh, he can't be calling you
because he's calling me at 9:00.\\
35 - That's why I got him
that watch as a gift.\\
36 - Well, maybe he should be calling
the person who gave him the gift of life.\\
37 - So you squeezed out a baby?
That was a hundred years ago.\\
38 - People have landed
on the moon since then.\\
39 - Hey, Eric.
I'm gonna miss you, man.\\
40 - Hey, uh, just between friends,\\
41 - I want you to know I'm gonna
take a shot or two at Donna.\\
42 - He won't care.\\
43 - On the road, he's going to
meet lots of horny girl hitchhikers\\
44 - looking for a ride
to cheerleading camp.\\
45 - What makes you think that, Fez?\\
46 - Adult films.\\
47 - Oh! Hello, America,\\
48 - and welcome to Eric Forman's
journey to happiness.\\
49 - Not to be mistaken with Eric
Forman's journey to Fatso Burger,\\
50 - or Eric Forman's journey to
pee behind the Piggly Wiggly,\\
51 - which you just saw earlier.\\
52 - I'll tell you, being on the road like
this really makes you feel like a man.\\
53 - I guess I'll just have to edit
that part out later.\\
54 - Okay. I think what
we've learned today\\
55 - is that the road can be
a cruel, cruel mistress.\\
56 - She caresses your tire with
her asphalt hand one minute,\\
57 - punctures it the next.\\
58 - But, hey, at least that didn't stop
me from making it out of Point Place.\\
59 - I think what we've learned today\\
60 - is that the road can be
a cruel, cruel mistress.\\
61 - But, hey, at least that didn't stop
me from making it out of Point Place.\\
62 - Hanging out\\
63 - Down the street\\
64 - The same old thing\\
65 - We did last week\\
66 - Not a thing to do\\
67 - But talk to you\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - We're all all right\\
70 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
71 - You know, Steven, it's great
we can still hang out.\\
72 - We're kind of
like Sonny and Cher.\\
73 - We're together
even though we're broken up.\\
74 - I'm beautiful,
you're weird-looking.\\
75 - Look, they're talking.
Maybe we should...\\
76 - Okay, we're going upstairs.\\
77 - Why?\\
78 - Uh, I just remembered that
I can't be in the basement\\
79 - because I'm uncomfortable
below sea level.\\
80 - That's the best
you can come up with?\\
81 - Just say that we're
going to take a shower.\\
82 - Wow.\\
83 - You know, I think this is the first time
we've been alone together since, uh...\\
84 - Yeah.\\
85 - Well, maybe we can use this opportunity
to touch base about our feelings.\\
86 - - Or we can watch TV.
- Great! Oh, I love TV.\\
87 - Oh, Janie, it's so
hard to be in the same room with you\\
88 - because even though
I'm a rough ne'er-do-well,\\
89 - my love for you burns
like a fire deep in my soul.\\
90 - I feel the same, Clyde,\\
91 - and even though we broke up
because you won't marry me,\\
92 - I still hope that one day
we'll get back together.\\
93 - What are the chances of that?\\
94 - Greetings, gentle viewer.\\
95 - Road trip update.\\
96 - About to change a flat tire,
which, uh...\\
97 - Which reminds me
of a little joke.\\
98 - How many psychiatrists does
it take to change a flat tire?\\
99 - Well, see, first the tire
has to really want to change.\\
100 - Good one.\\
101 - Anyway, what do you say we
slap a spare tire in this sucker, huh?\\
102 - It turns out
there is no spare tire.\\
103 - And it's, like,
pitch dark out here.\\
104 - Hello? Hello?\\
105 - Okay, there's definitely
someone out there,\\
106 - and I don't know who, but I
think it's a pretty safe bet to say\\
107 - that it's probably a convict
with a hook for a hand.\\
108 - Hello? Okay, okay, buddy.\\
109 - You come one step closer,
I got a tire iron.\\
110 - And I'll just give it to you
if you'll go away.\\
111 - Hey, dude.\\
112 - What are you doing here, man?\\
113 - Leo, what are you doing here?\\
114 - It's like the universe wanted
us to find each other, man.\\
115 - Yeah.\\
116 - So, do I know you, man?\\
117 - So, they're
a family of monsters?\\
118 - No, they're Munsters.\\
119 - And they're living in a
neighborhood of normal people.\\
120 - Why don't the neighbors just
get together with some guns\\
121 - and go over there and kill them?\\
122 - I'm pretty sure they're
saving that for the last episode.\\
123 - It's 9:15. Has Eric called?\\
124 - - He didn't call you?
- No.\\
125 - I thought sure
he would call you.\\
126 - He's always
choosing you over me.\\
127 - Name one time?\\
128 - Prom night.\\
129 - Okay, I haven't heard from him,\\
130 - and I'm starting to think that
something bad happened to him.\\
131 - Red, we have to go look for him.\\
132 - Fine.\\
133 - Anything's better
than this crap.\\
134 - Who wants to see monsters
not get killed?\\
135 - - Have you seen the new...
- Did you ever see...\\
136 - Go ahead.\\
137 - - See, the other day I...
- I saw...\\
138 - - You said, "Go ahead."
- Yeah, I said it to be nice.\\
139 - My story is much
more interesting.\\
140 - Well, go ahead,
because I'm not gonna listen.\\
141 - Well, fine then,
'cause I'm not gonna tell you.\\
142 - Oh, it's as quiet as a basement
with two former lovers in it.\\
143 - I can eat the tension
with a fork.\\
144 - Wouldn't you cut
the tension with a knife?\\
145 - Why cut it if you're not
gonna eat it?\\
146 - No, no, no. Fez, stay. Stay.\\
147 - Why don't you tell us
one of those\\
148 - charming little stories
about your homeland?\\
149 - Well, in my country, instead
of bathrooms, we just...\\
150 - He doesn't want to stay
down here with us.\\
151 - How would you know
what he wants?\\
152 - You don't know
what anybody wants.\\
153 - This is so sad.\\
154 - You're at each other's throats
because of these unresolved feelings.\\
155 - What? No.\\
156 - Fez, there are no
unresolved feelings.\\
157 - Really? Then why are you so
tense? Why is your foot tapping?\\
158 - Why is your foot tapping?\\
159 - Because I got rhythm, baby.\\
160 - I can never stop
dancing entirely.\\
161 - You know what, Leo? This is
my first truck stop and I love it.\\
162 - It's like... How did you
find this golden oasis?\\
163 - I woke up in
the parking lot once.\\
164 - And these truckers,
they're like...\\
165 - They seem like great
salt-of-the-earth guys, you know?\\
166 - Hey, 10-4, good buddies!\\
167 - Oh, crap, they're looking at me.\\
168 - No, they're looking at me, man.\\
169 - Truckers love me.
They think I'm Bob Seger.\\
170 - You know what? These guys
would be the perfect people\\
171 - to interview for my movie.\\
172 - - Where's your camera?
- Eh, it's so heavy.\\
173 - So, Leo, what have you been
doing since you left town?\\
174 - Uh, just wandering around
trying to find my place in life.\\
175 - Yeah, I've been trying to find
my place in life, too. It's like...\\
176 - You know, like,
where do I fit in?\\
177 - No, I've been looking
for my house, man.\\
178 - You boys need anything else?\\
179 - Uh, no, we're just waiting for the
mechanic I met in the parking lot\\
180 - to come back with
my spare tire and change.\\
181 - Honey, there's no
mechanic around here.\\
182 - Uh, no, there is.
It's this skinny guy.\\
183 - I gave him 20 bucks
and he just ran off.\\
184 - That'd be Earl.
He's a speed freak.\\
185 - Oh, my God. Leo, that
was my last 20 bucks.\\
186 - It's okay, man, dinner's on me.\\
187 - Oh, thanks, you'll pay?\\
188 - No, I mean I got
spaghetti sauce all over me.\\
189 - Leo, look, be serious, man.
What are we gonna do?\\
190 - I got it.\\
191 - We'll soak the shirt
in club soda.\\
192 - Okay, we're gonna use
my Police Academy training\\
193 - to figure out
what happened here.\\
194 - First thing I'm gonna need is
for everyone to lie face down\\
195 - with your hands
behind your head.\\
196 - What if he stopped to take a picture
and he got kidnapped by white slavers?\\
197 - They're gonna
kill him. He can't do anything.\\
198 - I told him this was
a stupid idea,\\
199 - and now we're stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.\\
200 - My foot is shaking, it wants
to kick his ass so bad.\\
201 - I never should have
let Eric go on this trip.\\
202 - I should have tempted him into
staying home by offering him sex.\\
203 - I mean, Scrabble.\\
204 - Oh, look, if my baby being safe
depended on you being loose,\\
205 - I wouldn't have to worry.\\
206 - Okay, I think it's obvious
what happened to Eric.\\
207 - We got an abandoned car,
a flat tire\\
208 - and footprints heading off
in that direction.\\
209 - Ms. Forman, your son's been
kidnapped by coyotes.\\
210 - Isn't it more likely
that he had a flat tire,\\
211 - couldn't change it himself
and went off to find some help?\\
212 - And the
coyotes got him along the way.\\
213 - Yeah, now you're
thinking like a cop.\\
214 - I can't believe I'm stuck in a
backwoods truck stop with no money.\\
215 - You know,
if we don't do something\\
216 - this waitress is just gonna
hand us over to these truckers.\\
217 - You know, they're all
freaky, sexual deviants.\\
218 - Man, woman, animal, they
don't care as long as it's warm.\\
219 - Don't worry, man, I've got an
idea how we can pay for this dinner.\\
220 - That was a good idea.\\
221 - Now, how are we
gonna pay for dinner?\\
222 - I think this pretty much
covers your tab.\\
223 - But if you're interested, dessert's
on me.\\
224 - In that case, you'd better
soak your uniform in club soda.\\
225 - You see?
What an awesome night.\\
226 - I am partying in the back of a truck
stop with a hippie and a waitress,\\
227 - who are now making out.\\
228 - Wow, the fact that I'm here is
not slowing them down at all.\\
229 - Good God, woman, you
buttered my toast with that hand.\\
230 - Okay, enough
pussyfooting around,\\
231 - which, by the way, does not
mean what I thought it meant.\\
232 - Why don't you just
get back together?\\
233 - You know you want to.\\
234 - I don't even know why you
broke up in the first place.\\
235 - Because he's an incredibly immature
jerk who can't commit to a future with me.\\
236 - What she said,
but I agree with me.\\
237 - Nice rebuttal,
which, by the way,\\
238 - also does not mean
what I thought it meant.\\
239 - It's hopeless, okay?\\
240 - We both wanted different
things out of the relationship.\\
241 - You just have to remember
the good times,\\
242 - the things that
brought you together.\\
243 - Jackie, what are some of the
things that Hyde did that you miss?\\
244 - He never did anything
a boyfriend's supposed to do.\\
245 - He never bought me a horse.\\
246 - Okay?\\
247 - He never rented a plane to
spell "I love you" in the sky.\\
248 - Oh, and he never even
wrote me a single song.\\
249 - How would you know? You never
stop talking long enough to listen.\\
250 - Wait, you wrote me a song?\\
251 - No.\\
252 - Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try something else.\\
253 - I want you to think back.\\
254 - Obviously, there was something
that brought you together.\\
255 - What was that?\\
256 - Well, I guess...\\
257 - I guess I liked the way his scruffy beard
felt on my soft, creamy, porcelain skin.\\
258 - Yeah, I kind of liked that, too.\\
259 - I also kind of liked the fact that
she was technically still with Kelso.\\
260 - And I knew being with him
would piss off my mom.\\
261 - And all my friends.\\
262 - Oh, and we had
to keep it a secret.\\
263 - And I felt kind of
ashamed of myself.\\
264 - So did I.\\
265 - I kind of liked that, too.\\
266 - So did I!\\
267 - Oh, it was just so wrong.\\
268 - Which is what made it so hot.\\
269 - So hot.\\
270 - Oh, Fez, you should
have been there.\\
271 - Several times I was.\\
272 - All right, listen,\\
273 - this type of establishment is
well known to criminals, okay?\\
274 - So I want you to stay close,
and if there's any trouble,\\
275 - I'm gonna use you guys
as a human shield.\\
276 - I don't like the looks
of these people.\\
277 - They seem like they could tease a
polite young man about his sweater\\
278 - and then laugh
when he starts to cry.\\
279 - Where is my baby?\\
280 - See, that's the problem.\\
281 - Maybe if you
didn't baby Eric so much\\
282 - he wouldn't have had to leave
to prove himself.\\
283 - Well, maybe if you hadn't exhausted
him with your sexual demands,\\
284 - he wouldn't have had to leave
just to get some sleep.\\
285 - All right, that's enough,
you two.\\
286 - If Eric's in trouble,
he deserves it\\
287 - because he should
know better by now.\\
288 - You sound like
you don't care at all.\\
289 - It's not a matter of not caring,
it's a matter of not giving a crap.\\
290 - Hey, Red, they got Rhinestone
Cowboy. Toss me a quarter.\\
291 - Shut up.\\
292 - For your information,\\
293 - Eric comes after me a lot more
than I go after him.\\
294 - You know, all you
damn redheads are the same.\\
295 - You can color it blonde,
but it's still there.\\
296 - Well, it turns out,\\
297 - I have a couple problems with being
a traveling documentary filmmaker.\\
298 - One, the traveling,
it's exhausting.\\
299 - Two, documentaries.\\
300 - I only like ones that are,
you know, about monkeys.\\
301 - And three, filmmaking.\\
302 - If there's no space battles, I mean,
you know, really, what's the point?\\
303 - I'll tell you something,
this day has not been a waste.\\
304 - I realized what I really
wanna do with my life\\
305 - is just get the hell out
of Point Place.\\
306 - I'm ready to do that.\\
307 - I really feel like
this trip made me a man.\\
308 - - Eric!
- Mommy?\\
309 - - Thank God you're okay.
- Oh, Dad, I'm fine.\\
310 - Not you, the car.\\
311 - Eric, your mom
called me a whore.\\
312 - Only because I was
worried about you,\\
313 - and because I love you
more than she does.\\
314 - Worried? What...\\
315 - What did you guys
think happened?\\
316 - Well, we figured you were either
dead, alive, or kidnapped by coyotes.\\
317 - Looks like I was right
on the money.\\
318 - Hey, I got that
waitress's phone number.\\
319 - Leo?\\
320 - Hey, it's great to see you guys.\\
321 - It's great to see you, Leo.\\
322 - So, do I know you, man?\\
323 - Okay, here's what I think,\\
324 - you two were hot for each other\\
325 - when the relationship
was secret, forbidden, taboo.\\
326 - But when it was out in
the open, the thrill was gone.\\
327 - It was no longer taboo.\\
328 - Then you started
pushing for commitment\\
329 - and you started pulling away.\\
330 - Hmm.\\
331 - So how do we move on from here?\\
332 - Move on?\\
333 - There will be no moving on.\\
334 - Your relationship was one of the
sickest freaking things I've ever seen.\\
335 - You are two deeply disturbed
individuals and your union...\\
336 - Well, your union
was a blasphemy.\\
337 - So you're saying
that if we hooked up again,\\
338 - it'd be even wronger
than before?\\
339 - It can get wronger?\\
340 - Well, that's kind of hot.\\
341 - Fez, I think maybe
you should leave the room now.\\
342 - Oh, no, no.
You two cannot be together.\\
343 - I can't watch. I'm leaving.\\
344 - Hey, who am I kidding?\\
345 - I can watch all night.\\
346 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
347 - Look who I found
by the side of the road.\\
348 - Leo. Man, what are you
doing back in town?\\
349 - I'm not really sure, man.\\
350 - Yeah, I can't tell if he has
amnesia or if he's just perfectly fine.\\
351 - Well, I'm glad you're back, man.\\
352 - Feeling's mutual, man.\\
353 - Hey, wait a second.
You're Hyde, man.\\
354 - Hey!
\subsection {Episode 18: Oh, Baby (We Got a Good Thing Goin')}
1 - Man, I am so psyched
for this auto show.\\
2 - I'm telling you,
once I trick out my El Camino,\\
3 - it is going to be
bad freaking ass.\\
4 - You know, tricking out
sounds a lot like accessorizing.\\
5 - Hey, don't ever
call it that, all right?\\
6 - But, yeah,
that's basically what it is.\\
7 - Kitty, I'm begging you to stop.\\
8 - There's gonna be hundreds
of auto parts salesmen,\\
9 - and now that I have
the muffler shop,\\
10 - they're gonna be getting
in line to kiss my butt.\\
11 - Well, and they will be
happy to kiss it\\
12 - because everything
from my house is spotless.\\
13 - All right,
I'm getting in the car,\\
14 - I'm counting to 60, and if
you're not there, I'm leaving.\\
15 - Ah.
The honeymoon speech again.\\
16 - I can't forget my book.\\
17 - You know, this new
Jackie Collins romance\\
18 - really gives me
a case of the tingles.\\
19 - Mrs. Forman, please, your
tingles are your own business.\\
20 - You move into my house,
you hear about my tingles.\\
21 - Jackie, I hope
you brought a book.\\
22 - When we get to the auto show,
the guys are gonna ignore us.\\
23 - Mrs. Forman,
I'm a beautiful girl\\
24 - with a shrill, demanding voice.\\
25 - I'm pretty hard to ignore.\\
26 - Okay, but we can't compete
with a bunch of cars.\\
27 - Wheels are like bosoms to men,\\
28 - and a car has four.\\
29 - I'm getting better.\\
30 - Leo, check it out.
It's my baby.\\
31 - Oh, this is Brooke.
Oh, isn't she adorable?\\
32 - Yeah.\\
33 - I can see why
you knocked her up.\\
34 - Michael, thanks again for watching
Betsy. Everyone else was busy.\\
35 - Thanks for trusting me.\\
36 - Yeah.\\
37 - It's my first time. I'm pretty
nervous. I tried on three outfits.\\
38 - No, you guys will be great.
All little girls love their daddies.\\
39 - Plus, I bet you'll probably
like a lot of the same toys.\\
40 - Oh, I'm late.\\
41 - Oh, yes.\\
42 - Hi.\\
43 - Bye, bye, Betsy-pie.
Mommy loves you.\\
44 - - Yes, she does. Yes, she does.
- All right, hand her over.\\
45 - - You're so attached. Just...
- Oh!\\
46 - Look, don't worry.
All she does is sleep.\\
47 - It's like taking care
of a bowling ball.\\
48 - I don't like bowling, man.\\
49 - You throw the ball down there
and it keeps coming back.\\
50 - It's spooky, man.\\
51 - Okay, Donna, I just
spent the last 10 minutes\\
52 - cologning and powdering myself.\\
53 - Now, let's peel them
and feel them.\\
54 - We can't because Fez is here.\\
55 - Yeah. I'm here and you can't.\\
56 - Fez, buddy, come on.\\
57 - You of all people should understand
how important sex is to a man.\\
58 - - Why should you do it
if I can't?
- Because I have a girlfriend.\\
59 - Why should you have
a girlfriend if I can't?\\
60 - - Okay, how are we gonna
work this out?
- Give her to me.\\
61 - Guys, check it out. Brooke
finally let me take care of Betsy.\\
62 - We're gonna stay here
for the day, okay?\\
63 - No. Come on. Donna and I
have a "do it" day planned.\\
64 - Yeah, and I think
I got a piece of this.\\
65 - Look, why don't you do it
at your house?\\
66 - I can't. My brother's friends
are over there,\\
67 - and they're playing darts,
and they don't use a dartboard.\\
68 - They just run around
and throw them at each other.\\
69 - Okay, Donna, I'm gonna go upstairs
and change into something sexy.\\
70 - Now either you come join me
in 60 seconds,\\
71 - or I'm gonna have to start
without you,\\
72 - and we both know how awkward
it is when you walk in on that.\\
73 - What's this?\\
74 - That's breast milk.
Don't touch it.\\
75 - Breast milk?
From real breasts?\\
76 - What don't they do?\\
77 - Kelso, she's so adorable.\\
78 - Why is she making
that weird face?\\
79 - It's poo!\\
80 - It smells in there, too.
It's everywhere.\\
81 - Hanging out\\
82 - Down the street\\
83 - The same old thing\\
84 - We did last week\\
85 - Not a thing to do\\
86 - But talk to you\\
87 - We're all all right\\
88 - We're all all right\\
89 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
90 - We have to dispose of
the dirty diaper.\\
91 - Shark.\\
92 - Shark.\\
93 - - What do you want me
to do with it?
- Just chuck it.\\
94 - - What about the shark?
- Chuck it. Chuck it all.\\
95 - Why is she still crying?
We just changed her.\\
96 - Maybe she doesn't like you.
Baby burn.\\
97 - No. I know what it is.\\
98 - We left her teddy bear at
my house. I'll go get it. Here.\\
99 - Um...\\
100 - Aren't you gonna
take her with you?\\
101 - No, I can't take Betsy
in my car.\\
102 - I took out the seat belts
to make it go faster.\\
103 - Okay, don't grab those.
I'm not your mommy.\\
104 - Yeah, a lady once said that
to me on the bus.\\
105 - Well, it wasn't a lady.
It was more like a man lady.\\
106 - It's hard to tell sometimes,
you know?\\
107 - Why tell this story, Fez?\\
108 - Why?\\
109 - Yeah, man, look at this place.
Chrome, tires, half-dressed women.\\
110 - It's like Sunday dinner
at my grandma's house.\\
111 - All right, salesmen, pucker up.\\
112 - Red Forman's ass
is in the building.\\
113 - Okay, well, mine's gone.
I give yours about 30 seconds.\\
114 - All right, Jackie, so let's
start off looking at new tires.\\
115 - Then after lunch, you can help me
pick out an obnoxiously loud car stereo.\\
116 - Wait, you're gonna spend
the day with Jackie?\\
117 - Yeah, man. She's my chick. All
right, I'm gonna go get us a funnel cake.\\
118 - But listen, this is a
rough crowd, all right?\\
119 - So if any guys come up to you and
offer to teach you how to drive a stick,\\
120 - just say no
and pull the fire alarm.\\
121 - - Told you he wouldn't ditch me.
- I'm his chick.\\
122 - Jackie, he's a man.\\
123 - Accept the fact
that he is not coming back.\\
124 - When I was in labor,
Red went to get me ice chips.\\
125 - I didn't see him
for an hour-and-a-half\\
126 - because he found
a pinball machine.\\
127 - - No way.
- But it's fine.\\
128 - I laugh about it now.\\
129 - I do.\\
130 - I will.\\
131 - It's just not that funny.\\
132 - - I think she's out.
- Well, in that case...\\
133 - Eric, we can't do that
with her in here.\\
134 - What? Come on.
She's fast asleep.\\
135 - And it's been
over a week for us.\\
136 - Donna, you can only keep
the tiger in its cage for so long.\\
137 - Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling it a tiger now.\\
138 - - Crap, the baby's awake.
- No, no, no, no, no.\\
139 - Hey, Betsy, close your eyes\\
140 - because Aunt Donna and
Uncle Eric are gonna do it.\\
141 - Eric, you are
seriously disturbed.\\
142 - - We have to take care of her.
- No, no, come on. She's fine.\\
143 - You can't put the tiger
back in his cage now, Donna.\\
144 - He's all agitated.\\
145 - How can a crying baby
not turn you off?\\
146 - Two words, Donna, eight teen.
Nothing turns me off.\\
147 - Yeah?\\
148 - Hey, Fez.\\
149 - Why are you staring
at that milk?\\
150 - It's from a breast.\\
151 - Simply remarkable.\\
152 - Okay, you're clearly a demented
pervert so let me ask you something.\\
153 - Would you be able to have sex
with a baby in the room?\\
154 - No way. I can barely do it
with a woman in the room.\\
155 - Congratulations, Eric. You're
more despicable sexually than Fez.\\
156 - Okay, Donna, here's the thing.\\
157 - I'm a man, so my
on-off switch is always on.\\
158 - Now you can either deal with
that, or you can switch to girls.\\
159 - Donna, if that's your baby,
I'm gonna snap Eric in half.\\
160 - Dad, don't you think you would
have noticed if I was pregnant?\\
161 - Not really. I'm not
that hands-on of a dad.\\
162 - Anyhoo, I bought a hammock
and put it up in the den\\
163 - 'cause it's too cold outside.
Now I need someone to push me.\\
164 - Sure, I'll push you
in the hammock, Bob.\\
165 - Then I'll climb up a tree
and pluck you a fresh coconut.\\
166 - I don't think so, Bob.\\
167 - Okay, it's your loss,
but I'm a big tipper.\\
168 - Okay. I got
Betsy's teddy bear,\\
169 - and it wasn't easy
dodging my brothers.\\
170 - I got a dart in the calf.\\
171 - Oh, here's my little girl.\\
172 - Hey, baby, look.\\
173 - Look, it's your teddy bear
and your handsome daddy.\\
174 - Why won't she stop crying?\\
175 - Maybe it is me.\\
176 - What if she doesn't like me?\\
177 - Kelso, don't take it personally.\\
178 - I didn't like you
when I first met you.\\
179 - But that's because you
were peeing on my swing set.\\
180 - Well, it was brand-new
and I was jealous.\\
181 - One funnel cake, extra sugar.\\
182 - Oh, Steven, I knew
you'd come back,\\
183 - and to show you how thankful I
am, I'm gonna feed you a piece.\\
184 - Oh, get a room.\\
185 - - Did you see Red?
- He didn't come back yet?\\
186 - That's weird. He was in front
of me in the funnel cake line.\\
187 - What the...\\
188 - Okay, gals, say,
"Funnel cake."\\
189 - Funnel cake.\\
190 - Oh, my God.\\
191 - There goes the fun.\\
192 - Well, I hope you're happy, Red
Forman, because we are leaving.\\
193 - You two, get your A-S-Ss
back to the car.\\
194 - You two, get your
B-double-O-Bs off my husband.\\
195 - I can't believe that
looking in this mirror\\
196 - isn't putting her
in a great mood.\\
197 - It always works for me.\\
198 - Man, am I glad I found you guys.\\
199 - All these houses look alike.\\
200 - Except for that red one on the
corner where the clown lives.\\
201 - That's a McDonald's.\\
202 - Well, whatever his name is,
he's funny.\\
203 - Hey, what's with the baby, man?\\
204 - I don't know. I can't
get her to quit crying.\\
205 - Here, let me try.\\
206 - Yeah.\\
207 - There.\\
208 - How did you do that?\\
209 - Babies love me, man,
'cause I'm fuzzy.\\
210 - I'll go give her a bottle.\\
211 - That proves it.
My own baby hates me.\\
212 - That's not true.\\
213 - She only stopped crying
when Leo held her\\
214 - because he has the shakes.\\
215 - No. It's me.\\
216 - She hardly knows me,\\
217 - and a girl needs her father,
you know, for guidance.\\
218 - What happens if she grows up
and starts dating, like, Fez?\\
219 - Boy, if she looks anything like
you, she'll be way out of my league.\\
220 - Kelso, if you really feel like that, you
should start getting to know her now.\\
221 - Go hold her.\\
222 - You're right.\\
223 - Leo?\\
224 - Oh, my God. They're gone.\\
225 - Everybody.
Everybody, just stay calm.\\
226 - The breast milk is safe.\\
227 - Are they outside?\\
228 - Not in the driveway, but
Eric went to check the park.\\
229 - And they're not upstairs.\\
230 - Although I did find Kitty's
special occasion panties\\
231 - hanging on the towel bar.\\
232 - There's a lot more going on
up there than we think.\\
233 - How could I let this happen?\\
234 - I am the worst father ever.\\
235 - Betsy?\\
236 - No, Michael, it's me. I'm calling
to check in. How's she doing?\\
237 - How's she doing? Fine.
God, quit smothering her.\\
238 - Hey, put the phone to her ear,
let me say hi.\\
239 - It's Brooke.
She wants to talk to the baby.\\
240 - Give me.\\
241 - Hey, Mama, send more milk.\\
242 - Was that Fez?\\
243 - Yeah.
We're just messing around.\\
244 - Betsy, she's sleeping.
She's...\\
245 - Yeah. She's sleeping
like a little...\\
246 - Something that sleeps a lot.\\
247 - Okay. Well, just give her a
kiss for me, and I'll see you later.\\
248 - Okay.\\
249 - You guys,
what am I gonna do? I'm...\\
250 - I'm really starting
to freak out.\\
251 - All right, Kelso, just relax.\\
252 - She's with Leo.
He's great with kids.\\
253 - I'm sure he's watching her
like a hawk.\\
254 - Oh, little sweetie.\\
255 - What are you doing
in my house, hippie?\\
256 - Are you sure this is your house?\\
257 - Of course it's my house.\\
258 - I believe you.\\
259 - The guy screaming
usually owns the house.\\
260 - All right, when Kitty shows
up, she's gonna be pretty mad.\\
261 - So I think we should
just leave her here.\\
262 - She can't get any madder.\\
263 - I think we should definitely
leave her here.\\
264 - Kitty.\\
265 - They tried to leave you.
I tried to stop them.\\
266 - Jackie, I'm perfectly fine.\\
267 - I just need to speak to Red
in the car for a minute.\\
268 - How could you, Red Forman?\\
269 - Steven stayed with Jackie,\\
270 - but you went off and gave
my funnel cake to those whores.\\
271 - I was just trying
to have a little fun.\\
272 - Oh, yeah?\\
273 - Well, you can take your fun
and shove it up your...\\
274 - Michael, I just want to talk
to my daughter.\\
275 - I'm sorry, Brooke.
She's still asleep.\\
276 - Kelso, tell her the truth
or I'm gonna touch you\\
277 - with Mrs. Forman's
special occasion panties.\\
278 - Oh, those are in my backpack.\\
279 - Okay.\\
280 - Brooke, about Betsy.\\
281 - There's something
I have to tell you.\\
282 - - Anyone lose a baby?
- I found her.\\
283 - "You found her"?\\
284 - No, I said, "I love her."\\
285 - - That is not what you said.
- You know what?\\
286 - You never listen to me.
I'm hanging up.\\
287 - Kelso, you did say
you found her.\\
288 - You know, you women
all stick together.\\
289 - I think she wants her daddy.\\
290 - It's okay.\\
291 - Daddy's here.\\
292 - Do you hear that?\\
293 - She stopped crying.\\
294 - I think she knows it's me.
And I think she likes me.\\
295 - That's so beautiful.\\
296 - I promised myself
I wouldn't do this.\\
297 - Listen, Kitty, I'm sorry
about today. It's just...\\
298 - They pay those ladies
to flirt with guys like me.\\
299 - They're almost hookers.\\
300 - I should have stayed in the den.\\
301 - No, no, no.
Those girls didn't bother me.\\
302 - I can outlast those tramps
any day of the week.\\
303 - It was just seeing
Steven and Jackie together.\\
304 - Oh, you can't compare our mature
relationship to what those kids have.\\
305 - We're past all those
highs and lows.\\
306 - We're like a sailboat
in a dead calm.\\
307 - Look, Kitty,\\
308 - the important thing
is every morning\\
309 - I get to wake up next to my
favorite girl in the whole world.\\
310 - Reginald Albert Forman.\\
311 - Whoa.\\
312 - Okay, how about that?
On or off?\\
313 - Yeah, that's a showstopper.\\
314 - Oh, that's too bad
'cause it really turns me on.\\
315 - No, get... God, get off of me.\\
316 - Who loves you?\\
317 - Your daddy does, that's who.\\
318 - Well, I can't remember the last time
you made that much of a fuss over me.\\
319 - Oh, there's my baby girl.\\
320 - Mommy missed you.\\
321 - Yeah, I don't want
to let her go.\\
322 - She's so beautiful and warm.\\
323 - Well, apparently
I'm ugly and cold.\\
324 - - Oh, here. Look at her smiling.
- There we go.\\
325 - Oh, I'm so happy
she loves her daddy.\\
326 - - Yeah.
- Yes, it is.\\
327 - Hey, listen.\\
328 - I know I haven't
been around much,\\
329 - but that's gonna change\\
330 - 'cause she's my girl
and I wanna know her.\\
331 - That would be awesome.\\
332 - - I got it.
- Grab her stuff. I'll go put her in the car.\\
333 - Yeah. Here.\\
334 - Thanks.\\
335 - You need help, man.\\
336 - Yes, I do.\\
337 - I hate myself.\\
338 - But the money's just so good.\\
339 - Little faster
so it stirs my drink.
\subsection {Episode 19: Who's Been Sleeping Here}
1 - Okay, the game is Password.\\
2 - The box says,
"Using one-word clues,\\
3 - "get your partner
to say the secret word\\
4 - "without using the word
yourself."\\
5 - - Okay, what if...
- Donna, please.\\
6 - I already read the box.\\
7 - - But, Fez...
- I said "box."\\
8 - Okay, here are your
secret words and good luck.\\
9 - Okay, Eric, staircase.\\
10 - Jedi.\\
11 - I'm sorry, that's wrong.\\
12 - Hyde?\\
13 - Um...\\
14 - Fat.\\
15 - Staircase.\\
16 - Fat.\\
17 - - Escalator.
- Yes.\\
18 - That is correct.\\
19 - - What?
- What the hell?\\
20 - Jackie, see me later
for your prize.\\
21 - Oh, we are so better than you.\\
22 - Eric, how did you get "Jedi"
from "staircase"?\\
23 - Donna, the path to becoming
a Jedi has many steps, duh.\\
24 - You guys, I just took my
baby girl to the playground,\\
25 - and she's just like her daddy.\\
26 - She's way cuter than all the
other babies, and she eats bugs.\\
27 - Wow, Michael, you've spent every
weekend this month with Betsy.\\
28 - The only other thing you've done
this consistently was cheat on me.\\
29 - That's not true, he also glues
himself to stuff with amazing regularity.\\
30 - Whatever.\\
31 - Look, Brooke is totally starting
to trust me now with Betsy,\\
32 - and she's letting me
pick out Betsy's godparents.\\
33 - And she only has one rule,
it can't be Fez.\\
34 - Well, that is a smart rule.\\
35 - Godparents? Like we need
any more responsibilities.\\
36 - I know, such a burden.\\
37 - Okay, so I've been thinking
about this a lot, all right?\\
38 - And it's a big deal, so...\\
39 - - Eric, Donna.
- Uh-oh.\\
40 - Please, skootch over so I can
ask Hyde and Jackie\\
41 - if they'll be
Betsy's godparents.\\
42 - - What the hell?
- Hyde and Jackie?\\
43 - We win.\\
44 - I was voted most popular,
best legs, and now, Godmother.\\
45 - What can't I do?\\
46 - And the password is
burn.\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
56 - Oh, my God,
this place is a mess.\\
57 - Well, it's obvious,
you've had a break-in.\\
58 - And that pizza box is a clue.\\
59 - Yep, they're Italian.\\
60 - Someone broke into my store.
What if they stole something?\\
61 - Oh, no.\\
62 - It's okay, my stash is safe.\\
63 - Not entirely.\\
64 - I got into it
a little bit yesterday.\\
65 - You guys, what are we gonna do?\\
66 - What are we gonna do?
We don't have to do nothing.\\
67 - Nothing big was taken,
probably some kids having fun.\\
68 - Fun?\\
69 - Yeah, you know, fun,
that thing you've never had.\\
70 - I have plenty of fun, okay.
Michael, I'm fun, right?\\
71 - You're good-looking.\\
72 - Well, I think you would make
a great godparent, Eric.\\
73 - You were so sweet
with your pet fish.\\
74 - Remember, you'd feed it
potato chips and say,\\
75 - "Look, everybody,
fish and chips."\\
76 - All I remember is flushing it
down the toilet when he killed it.\\
77 - Who takes a fish
out of the tank?\\
78 - I just needed to hug something.\\
79 - Why do you think
Kelso didn't choose us?\\
80 - Well, picking godparents
can be very nerve-racking.\\
81 - When Laurie was born, we
agonized over that decision for weeks.\\
82 - And we chose well. Mike
and Cookie were good people.\\
83 - Wait, so, who are my godparents?\\
84 - Well, they're the...\\
85 - The Hoffenschnoppers.\\
86 - I'm sorry, the who?\\
87 - The Hingingloobers.\\
88 - Okay, I think you just said
the Hoffenschnoppers,\\
89 - and then you said
the Hingingloobers.\\
90 - And I'm not sure,
but I don't think we know\\
91 - any Hoffenschnoppers
or Hingingloobers.\\
92 - Come on, what's supposed to
happen to me if you guys die?\\
93 - Maybe you'll finally move out
and get a job.\\
94 - You know, the responsibilities
of being a godmother never ends.\\
95 - You know, I spent all day
buying matching outfits.\\
96 - You know, life is so much more
fulfilling now that I'm shopping for two.\\
97 - Okay, being a godmother
isn't all about buying stuff.\\
98 - Oh, yeah?
What's it about then?\\
99 - Oh, you don't know, either.\\
100 - You guys, great news.\\
101 - Brooke is gonna let me
have Betsy on the weekends.\\
102 - Oh, my God. If Betsy's
coming here on weekends,\\
103 - we're gonna need matching
godmother-goddaughter badminton skirts.\\
104 - Now you're just trying
to make me mad.\\
105 - Okay, you know what? We don't
have to stand here and take this.\\
106 - - Yeah.
- Let's go.\\
107 - Where are we going?\\
108 - I don't know, but we are just going
to stand outside until they leave.\\
109 - Well, I am proud of you, Michael,
getting so involved in your baby's life.\\
110 - A child needs
a strong, loving father.\\
111 - Well, I am glad
you feel that way.\\
112 - So you won't mind,
when Betsy visits,\\
113 - if we stay up in Laurie's room?\\
114 - No.\\
115 - No babies.\\
116 - We get enough crying
around here with Eric.\\
117 - Come on, Laurie's not using it.\\
118 - It's a great room
with a very comfortable bed.\\
119 - How the hell
would you know that?\\
120 - The... Laurie always
had such good posture.\\
121 - That indicates
a quality mattress.\\
122 - - What's wrong
with your house, honey?
- It's not safe.\\
123 - If my brothers don't step on
her, one of the dogs probably will.\\
124 - - You have dogs?
- No, we don't know
whose they are.\\
125 - - Hey, you're here early.
- Not early enough.\\
126 - We were broken into again.\\
127 - Well, at least these kids
leave more than they take.\\
128 - We're not being robbed, man,
we're being cluttered.\\
129 - - I'm calling the cops.
- No, don't call the cops.\\
130 - Why not?\\
131 - 'Cause then they show up
and they act all coppy.\\
132 - You know what I think?\\
133 - I think you're the one
coming in here at night.\\
134 - Why would I come here
when I have a house?\\
135 - Well, a basement.\\
136 - Why don't you tell me about
the $10 missing from the register?\\
137 - Are you accusing me of stealing?\\
138 - Well, you don't want me
to call the cops.\\
139 - And of all the people I know,
and I know 28 people,\\
140 - you are, by far,
the most likely to burgle.\\
141 - Yeah, you know, I don't actually
have to take this from you, Angie.\\
142 - - I thought
you didn't call the cops?
- I didn't.\\
143 - Guys, I don't know
how to turn off the siren.\\
144 - Hey, Fez, let me
ask you a question.\\
145 - If you were choosing godparents,\\
146 - wouldn't you choose
Donna and me?\\
147 - Well, in my country
we don't have godparents.\\
148 - If something happens to
your parents, tough crap.\\
149 - You're a bum.\\
150 - You Americans
and your safety nets.\\
151 - Hey, Eric,
are your folks around?\\
152 - Why, do you wanna bestow some
honor on them that we should rightly have?\\
153 - No, I'm trying to sneak this
crib up into Laurie's room,\\
154 - and I figure if I get it up there,
there's no way they can get it down\\
155 - 'cause they're too old.\\
156 - Kelso, I just can't believe
you picked Hyde over me.\\
157 - I mean, what exactly was your
criteria in choosing a godparent?\\
158 - I mean, was it the ability
to shoplift a keg?\\
159 - My reasons are complicated.\\
160 - Complicated or stupid?\\
161 - There are elements of both.\\
162 - Down.\\
163 - - But...
- Down.\\
164 - Well, we were broken into
again last night,\\
165 - but you already know that
since it was you.\\
166 - Yeah, you busted me, Angie.\\
167 - Sneaking into my own store so I
can eat pizza and listen to Neil Sedaka.\\
168 - After the second break-in, I had Michael
install a hidden surveillance camera.\\
169 - It's the same one
he tried to use in my shower.\\
170 - You spied on me?\\
171 - Yep, and I thought we could watch
the tape, for the first time, together.\\
172 - Hey, I'm watching Perry Mason.\\
173 - Oh, guess what?
Perry Mason wins.\\
174 - It's not if he wins, it's how.
That's the magic, damn it.\\
175 - Oh, look, there's Michael.\\
176 - Even when he's not here,
I have to see his ass.\\
177 - I've seen it almost as many
times as I've seen his face.\\
178 - Oh, look. Someone's coming in.\\
179 - Fez?\\
180 - Hey, Red, am I late for Perry
Mason? Ooh! Who's that handsome...\\
181 - Uh-oh.\\
182 - - Fez, what are you
doing there?
- It was a secret.\\
183 - I... I thought I was alone.\\
184 - Okay, I know Fez pretty well
and if he thought he was alone,\\
185 - we need to stop
this tape right now.\\
186 - Fez, man, why were you staying
at the record store?\\
187 - Well, last week
my Bible-thumping host parents\\
188 - found out that
I already graduated,\\
189 - so they kicked me out and
took all my money as back rent.\\
190 - And then they gave me a Bible.\\
191 - Well, I wish
you'd been reading that\\
192 - instead of the porno magazines
I found in my office.\\
193 - You know, Angie, some things
you could keep to yourself.\\
194 - I don't understand why you
didn't just ask us for help.\\
195 - I mean, we're your friends.\\
196 - It was my damn Latin pride.\\
197 - - So you're Latin.
- No, just my pride is.\\
198 - And I also have
a Swiss sense of frugality.\\
199 - Steven, how could you not know
your friend was a hobo?\\
200 - Well, now that I think about it,
some things do make more sense.\\
201 - - Hey, man, where the hell
are my keys?
- Oh, here they are.\\
202 - I just borrowed them,
but I didn't make a copy.\\
203 - - Why would you make a copy?
- Why would I borrow them?\\
204 - - To make a copy?
- Why would I make a copy?\\
205 - Okay.\\
206 - - Did you just take
a shower here?
- No.\\
207 - - Why are you wearing a towel?
- Because otherwise
I'd be naked.\\
208 - Oh, there they are.\\
209 - Hey, I was just happy he's
wearing underwear again, all right?\\
210 - I can't believe Kelso didn't choose
us. What could be wrong with us?\\
211 - Well, there's nothing
wrong with you.\\
212 - I love you just the way you are.\\
213 - - Yeah, and I love you
just the way you...
- Although, well...\\
214 - It might be that
you don't have a job.\\
215 - Oh, here it comes.\\
216 - You've just been dying to
get this off your chest, huh?\\
217 - I don't have a job.
I play with toys.\\
218 - Maybe you'd like to talk about how I
didn't show up for the wedding, too?\\
219 - Oh, well, I don't need
to talk about that\\
220 - because I relive it every
morning when I wake up alone.\\
221 - Oh, really? Well,
you used to be a redhead.\\
222 - You dyed your hair. God, it's like
everything about you now is so fake.\\
223 - Whoa!\\
224 - You said you loved my hair.\\
225 - I had to say that, Donna,
to keep you happy.\\
226 - You trap people,
you're a trapper.\\
227 - Nobody wants a trapper
for a godmother.\\
228 - Wait a minute.
What are we doing?\\
229 - You know what?
You're right, let's back up.\\
230 - Man, why do we want to be
godparents so bad?\\
231 - Well, I want it for the joy of
nurturing the spiritual growth of a child.\\
232 - - I want it for the prestige.
- Yeah, me, too. I was just saying that.\\
233 - Hello.\\
234 - Man, why does everybody
look so serious?\\
235 - Did the Goodyear Blimp crash?\\
236 - Why?\\
237 - No reason.\\
238 - Some people shoot
bottle rockets at it.\\
239 - Fez has been living
in the record store\\
240 - because his host parents
threw him out.\\
241 - What kind of parents
would kick a child out?\\
242 - And will they teach me
how they did it?\\
243 - You wanna be mean?
You don't get a sandwich.\\
244 - I think what they did to you
is just awful.\\
245 - - He broke into my store.
- Which you
accused me of doing.\\
246 - Accusing your own brother?
You don't get a sandwich, either.\\
247 - Anyway, Fez, maybe you can
stay in Laurie's room.\\
248 - No.\\
249 - I would rather fill that room
with cement.\\
250 - Yeah, respect the man's wishes.\\
251 - Besides, that room
is for me and Betsy.\\
252 - I don't get a sandwich.\\
253 - Okay, I have an idea.\\
254 - You and Fez both need
a place to live, right?\\
255 - Yeah.\\
256 - And living alone can get
kind of lonely, can't it?\\
257 - Sometimes I cry myself to sleep.\\
258 - - You see where
I'm going with this?
- I do.\\
259 - We each get our own apartment and
we call each other on the phone a lot.\\
260 - Or we could be roommates.\\
261 - Roommates?\\
262 - That is an awesome idea.\\
263 - What were you thinking of,
Ms. Forman?\\
264 - That you two
should be roommates.\\
265 - Oh, thanks, but we
already thought of that.\\
266 - All right, why did you
choose them over us?\\
267 - - Is it 'cause
I don't have a job?
- Is it because I dyed my hair?\\
268 - Look, I don't have a job because
Hyde turned me into a burnout.\\
269 - And I dyed my hair because
Jackie destroyed my self-esteem.\\
270 - Also, I rock as a blonde.\\
271 - Are you beginning to see the
influence that they have on people?\\
272 - I'm telling you,
if you stick with them,\\
273 - your daughter's just gonna be a
burnout, low self-esteem lump with no job.\\
274 - All right, you're just trying
to make us look bad.\\
275 - Yeah, they're doing a decent job
of it. Kelso, why did you pick us?\\
276 - Oh, great, now I feel awkward.\\
277 - Look, I picked them because I think
they're gonna last longer than you.\\
278 - - What?
- They just broke up
and got back together.\\
279 - Well, at least
they're doing something.\\
280 - What are you guys doing?
You don't know, nobody knows.\\
281 - They're just
a safer bet right now.\\
282 - Oh, my God.\\
283 - This is better than when
he made us godparents.\\
284 - We win everything.\\
285 - Wow. Well, I don't really
have a speech prepared\\
286 - but I just wanna thank
you guys for sucking.\\
287 - Look, you guys,\\
288 - if I knock somebody else up
you're totally on the list.\\
289 - I can't believe he doesn't
think we're gonna last. It's...\\
290 - I mean, you don't think
he's right, do you?\\
291 - Well, I don't know. We have,
kind of, been drifting this last year.\\
292 - No. No, not drifting,
you know, exploring.\\
293 - Exploring is drifting, Eric.\\
294 - Oh, you know what?
This is all your fault.\\
295 - You're always saying that
something is something else.\\
296 - God, it's like you're a big,
blonde thesaurus.\\
297 - - Well, excuse me
for knowing words, Eric.
- Okay, you know what?\\
298 - This fight keeps going nowhere
and you wanna know why?\\
299 - We are actually freaking out
over something that Kelso said.\\
300 - Kelso, the guy
who doesn't understand\\
301 - how hot dogs survive
in the wild without eyes.\\
302 - Okay, so you're not...\\
303 - - You're not worried then?
- No.\\
304 - I don't know, maybe a
little bit, but I'll tell you what.\\
305 - - I'm gonna find a job.
- Great. And I am gonna
dye my hair back.\\
306 - No. Oh, no, no,
the blonde stays.\\
307 - I'm still using it.\\
308 - All right, man,
you accused me of stealing.\\
309 - That's why I've thought up a
very clever way of getting you back.\\
310 - Today you wear the rainbow Afro.\\
311 - Actually, you know what?
I don't think so.\\
312 - Watch this.\\
313 - Luck be a lady tonight\\
314 - Luck be a lady tonight\\
315 - Luck if you've ever
been a lady to begin with...\\
316 - I don't care about that.\\
317 - Everybody knows
I sing Sinatra all the time.\\
318 - Whoa, shoplifter.\\
319 - Amateur.\\
320 - Here's two bedrooms
with one-and-a-half baths.\\
321 - A half bath?\\
322 - How's the water stay in?\\
323 - Here's one with a dishwasher.\\
324 - I don't want another foreigner
living with us.\\
325 - We don't need
a dishwasher anyway.\\
326 - - Who's gonna do the dishes?
- We'll just order in.\\
327 - You never wanna
take me anywhere.
\subsection {Episode 20: Gimme Shelter}
1 - I'm so glad
I graduated high school.\\
2 - You know, it is such a relief
to finally know everything.\\
3 - I can't believe
I graduated a year ago.\\
4 - It's like I feel
like I've done nothing.\\
5 - Man, time really flies
when you take two naps a day.\\
6 - Well, I wouldn't say you've
done nothing. I mean, you've...\\
7 - Wow, you've
really sat on your ass.\\
8 - Yep, Forman,
we've all passed you by.\\
9 - I'm running a record store,
Donna's a DJ, Kelso's a cop.\\
10 - Even Fez has a job now.\\
11 - What is it again,
man, shower girl?\\
12 - Makeup lady?\\
13 - Shampoo boy!\\
14 - Hey, I was close.\\
15 - Wait a second. This mean
I'm the loser of the group now?\\
16 - You're the one that's still
living with your mommy.\\
17 - Man, you're still
living with your mommy.\\
18 - Not for long. Me and Fez
are looking for apartments.\\
19 - Then the only
time I'll see my mom\\
20 - is when she's doing my
laundry, cooking my meals,\\
21 - taking me to the dentist.\\
22 - Eric, I feel kind of bad.\\
23 - You wouldn't even be thinking
about this kind of stuff\\
24 - if you weren't caught in the
blinding light of my bright future.\\
25 - You know, the scary thing is,
if one year went by this fast,\\
26 - imagine where Eric
is gonna be in 10 years.\\
27 - Thanks for going with me to
the Star Trek convention, Uhura.\\
28 - You can call me Donna now.\\
29 - That's good, Fez, but I think
it's gonna be more like this.\\
30 - Thanks for going with me to
the Star Wars convention, Leia.\\
31 - You can call me Donna now.\\
32 - No, man. You're both wrong.\\
33 - Actually, it's gonna
go like this.\\
34 - Thanks for going with me to
the Star Wars convention, Leia.\\
35 - You can call me Mom now.\\
36 - - Whoa.
- Eric, they're joking around.\\
37 - - It's funny.
- No, Donna, it's not funny. In fact...\\
38 - It's completely possible!\\
39 - Hanging out\\
40 - Down the street\\
41 - The same old thing\\
42 - We did last week\\
43 - Not a thing to do\\
44 - But talk to you\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - We're all all right\\
47 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
48 - Every one of my friends has
a career path except for me.\\
49 - Even Kelso. Kelso!\\
50 - The kid who thinks that NATO
is Japanese for "neato."\\
51 - You know, it's just not fair.\\
52 - I mean, you sleep late,
you watch TV all day.\\
53 - The job offers
should be rolling in.\\
54 - Why don't you look into that
chiropractic school I suggested?\\
55 - They're having
an enrolment seminar.\\
56 - You know, a chiropractor
is a very prestigious job,\\
57 - especially if you move someplace\\
58 - where they don't
have real doctors.\\
59 - Well, I guess chiropractor is as
good as anything I've come up with.\\
60 - I have wasted an entire year
doing absolutely nothing.\\
61 - Hey, how about a job
stating the obvious,\\
62 - 'cause you're getting
really good at that.\\
63 - So, you're gonna be
a chiropractor, huh?\\
64 - All right, every chick
patient that you have,\\
65 - you have to tell her
the problem is her tailbone,\\
66 - that way you get to
grab around on her butt.\\
67 - Kelso, I'm doing this
'cause I wanna help people.\\
68 - A handful of ass is just a perk.\\
69 - Okay, so I just want
to remind everybody\\
70 - about my graduation dinner
party tomorrow night.\\
71 - Be there by 6:00 for
the champagne toast.\\
72 - Free champagne? I'm in.\\
73 - Free toast? I am in, too.\\
74 - Jackie, a dinner party?\\
75 - Can't we do something fun,\\
76 - like drive up to the border
and throw stuff at Canadians?\\
77 - I mean, they never fight back
'cause they're Canadian.\\
78 - Steven, this dinner
party is an important event\\
79 - to mark my entrance
into womanhood.\\
80 - Didn't that happen three years
ago in the backseat of Kelso's car?\\
81 - I love talking about
this in front of Hyde.\\
82 - Yeah, me, too,
'cause that way I can do this.\\
83 - Too hard.\\
84 - Michael, I circled some
apartment listings for you and Fez.\\
85 - I found a great apartment for
Janet Meyers after her divorce.\\
86 - It has a Murphy bed for
when her kids come to visit.\\
87 - They never do.\\
88 - She's in AA.\\
89 - Look at all these
places for rent.\\
90 - Man, I hope we can find one
that's got everything my baby needs.\\
91 - Oh, Kelso, you're
always putting me first.\\
92 - Not you, moron.\\
93 - Betsy, my daughter.\\
94 - It's amazing how one tiny person
has changed my life so much.\\
95 - You changed mine, too.\\
96 - Dr. Don loves being a
chiropractor, and you know why?\\
97 - Because the cosmos has ordained
Dr. Don to make people feel good.\\
98 - Do you get the feeling that Dr. Don writes
himself a few too many prescriptions?\\
99 - No, I think he's cool,\\
100 - and I love the way
he calls himself Dr. Don.\\
101 - Eric's impressed.\\
102 - Within these hands
lies an unexplainable magic\\
103 - that melts away
the troubles of the world.\\
104 - And Dr. Don will
prove it to you\\
105 - by demonstrating on this
attractive blonde in the front row.\\
106 - Uh, no, I'm only here to make
sure my boyfriend doesn't sneak out\\
107 - to play Space Invaders.\\
108 - Step on up here, little lady.\\
109 - Donna, come on. I need
to make a good impression.\\
110 - Look, one little medical
experiment isn't gonna kill you.\\
111 - Come on.
Here we go, right on up here.\\
112 - And now just relax.\\
113 - Dr. Don has been known
to cause patients serious joy.\\
114 - Wow. That felt great.\\
115 - Uh-oh. I think
your tailbone's out of whack.\\
116 - All right, show's over.\\
117 - No. Come on.\\
118 - Man, we gotta have this place.
It's perfect for the baby.\\
119 - It already smells
a little bit like throw up.\\
120 - Mrs. Forman, you found
us a great apartment.\\
121 - I could just kiss you.\\
122 - Can I kiss you?\\
123 - Bob, what are you doing here?\\
124 - You're selling your house
because you're broke.\\
125 - I knew something was wrong when I
didn't see you wearing fur this winter.\\
126 - No, I come to open houses
to meet women.\\
127 - If a lady's looking
for her own place,\\
128 - she's either single or running
away from a bad relationship.\\
129 - Either way, I win.\\
130 - Is everything all right over...\\
131 - Oh, it's you.\\
132 - Fenton.\\
133 - I'd shake your hand,
but I'm afraid I'd catch\\
134 - some kind of third world herpe.\\
135 - Well, that's fine,
'cause I wouldn't let you\\
136 - touch me with a 10-foot pole.\\
137 - Well, I wouldn't touch you
with a 20-foot pole.\\
138 - You don't even
have a 20-foot pole.\\
139 - Maybe I'll go buy one just
so I can't touch you with it.\\
140 - Fez, who is this guy?\\
141 - This is Fenton.\\
142 - We are having a feud.\\
143 - Oh, filling out
an application, hmm?\\
144 - Yes. We got here first so
don't even think about applying.\\
145 - I don't have to, I'm the
landlord. The lord of the land.\\
146 - And I'm gonna lord it over you
while your butts land outside.\\
147 - That was clever.\\
148 - Oh, yeah?\\
149 - Well, I was gonna give you
this $5 to get the apartment,\\
150 - but now you can forget it.\\
151 - That was clever.\\
152 - Too slow, old man.\\
153 - Fez, if you're not polite, he's
gonna figure out you're living here.\\
154 - You're living here?\\
155 - Oh, great. You blew it, Fez.\\
156 - Red, he has nowhere else to go.\\
157 - Well, know this, Pele...\\
158 - ...you gotta sleep sometime.\\
159 - And during the war,
when they were sleeping,\\
160 - that's when I got them.\\
161 - That wasn't too bad.\\
162 - He called you Pele.\\
163 - He is a terrific soccer player.\\
164 - Oh, everything is set
for the party tonight.\\
165 - Oh, and, Fez, I need you
to get there a little early\\
166 - so you can park everyone's cars.\\
167 - - Sorry, Jackie,
I can't make it.
- What?\\
168 - Yeah, Kelso and I have to go
find an apartment tonight\\
169 - or Red is going to
kill me in my sleep.\\
170 - - Yeah, and I can't
let Fez go alone.
- Why not?\\
171 - 'Cause then I'll have to go to
your party, which I don't want to do.\\
172 - Whoa. No, no,
no. Kelso, you have to go.\\
173 - If you're not there
and Fez is not there,\\
174 - it's gonna be pretty damn
obvious that I'm not there.\\
175 - Okay, Steven, I understand
you don't like dinner parties,\\
176 - but just let me make my case.\\
177 - You're going!\\
178 - You know, the more I read
this chiropractor booklet,\\
179 - the more I'm starting to see that
this might be the perfect job for me.\\
180 - Like, it says right here,
you need soft hands.\\
181 - How many times have you said you
didn't even know I was touching you?\\
182 - - Here, let me get
a crack at that neck.
- Whoa.\\
183 - Shouldn't we wait until you're,
like, a little more experienced?\\
184 - Experienced?
Donna, I'm on page 12. Let's do this.\\
185 - Ow!\\
186 - Uh-oh. That did not
sound good.\\
187 - Eric, I can't move my neck.
Fix it.\\
188 - Okay, I'm sure the booklet
says something about...\\
189 - Oh, here it is.\\
190 - Um, okay, I'm gonna need
you to sign a release of liability.\\
191 - Poor Donna.\\
192 - I think I hurt her pretty bad.\\
193 - Her neck's stuck,
just tilted over like this.\\
194 - Yeah, but on the upside,\\
195 - it looks like she's really interested
in everything I have to say.\\
196 - So she's got a bad neck.
Quit whining.\\
197 - I've gone out with girls
that don't even have necks.\\
198 - "Hi, Fez."\\
199 - One time, this girl whipped
her head around to look at me\\
200 - 'cause I'm hot,
and her neck just snapped.\\
201 - And then she collapsed
into the jukebox.\\
202 - Kelso, that was The Fonz.\\
203 - Well, where do you
think they got it from?\\
204 - Forman, forget being
a chiropractor, man.\\
205 - The way I see it, you're
diligent, tidy and detail-oriented.\\
206 - So I think you should become
a professional butt wiper.\\
207 - Come on, man, this is serious.\\
208 - Eric, you gotta start off slow.\\
209 - First you should be
an amateur butt wiper.\\
210 - What's wrong with you two?
So rude.\\
211 - Eric, I think you should
move to Paris.\\
212 - That way you can
become a butt wipier.\\
213 - How'd the apartment search go?\\
214 - Not so good. They can't
find anything they like.\\
215 - Well, how can you be picky?
You lived in a jungle.\\
216 - Any place without a gorilla
charging at you should be paradise.\\
217 - Red, I don't think he
lived with gorillas.\\
218 - Did you?\\
219 - Where the blazes are you from?\\
220 - Apparently, Gorilla Land.\\
221 - We found one place yesterday
that was perfect,\\
222 - but we can't get it 'cause Fez
and the landlord are having a feud.\\
223 - Well, you're not spending
another night under my roof.\\
224 - So come on, we're gonna go
have a chat with this landlord.\\
225 - What's this guy got
against you anyway?\\
226 - Who knows? That's like asking
you why you hate commies.\\
227 - You don't know why.
You just do.\\
228 - I know exactly
why I hate commies.\\
229 - They wouldn't stop
shooting at me.\\
230 - Okay, then something
else you hate.\\
231 - Oh, you should have said
the Vienna Boys' Choir.\\
232 - I just want to
punch them in the mouth.\\
233 - How you doing,
my little buttercup?\\
234 - Great.\\
235 - The Brady Bunch
is so much funnier sideways.\\
236 - Okay, so, at my party tonight,\\
237 - I want everyone to give heartfelt
speeches about me, okay?\\
238 - So here they are.\\
239 - I don't think I can
make it to your party.\\
240 - Wait, but, Donna, you have to.\\
241 - I'm afraid I'm out, too.\\
242 - I gotta tend to my
crooked little flower here.\\
243 - You know, Eric, calling me
cute little nicknames\\
244 - doesn't make up
for what you did.\\
245 - Okay.\\
246 - Hey, whatever you say,
my little crazy straw.\\
247 - I can't believe
everyone bailed out on me.\\
248 - You know, tonight was
really important to me,\\
249 - and it's like no one even cares.\\
250 - Jackie, you look like you really
need to talk this through, huh?\\
251 - I'll go get Mrs. Forman.\\
252 - Are you Fenton? I'm here to
talk to you about the apartment.\\
253 - Well, you're in luck, it's still
available. And FYI, so am I.\\
254 - Look, I have a wife.\\
255 - Well, I have a football,
but I never use it.\\
256 - Red, I know you
said wait in the car,\\
257 - but Fez keeps playing
his crazy bongo music.\\
258 - It's called jazz,
you Philistine.\\
259 - Oh, you're with them. Deal's
off. I have to get to yoga.\\
260 - - Hey, can't we talk
about this?
- No.\\
261 - See, I told you
he was going to be...\\
262 - Just shut it
or I'll shut it for you.\\
263 - Well, you just don't take crap
from anyone, do you, Mr. Man?\\
264 - I knew this was gonna be a
waste of time. Come on, Fez.\\
265 - We'll go figure out some
other place to live with the baby.\\
266 - Baby? No one
mentioned they had a baby.\\
267 - - That... That's so progressive.
- Progressive?\\
268 - Well, how can I not give the apartment
to two men raising a child together?\\
269 - Oh.\\
270 - Yeah, progressive.\\
271 - Yeah, that's what they are.\\
272 - They're as progressive as hell.\\
273 - Why, they're like newlyweds.\\
274 - Oh. Mmm.\\
275 - I wish I knew
what that was like.\\
276 - Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.\\
277 - Well, Red convinced Fenton
to give us the apartment.\\
278 - Yeah, and Red seemed so happy.\\
279 - All the way home, he just
kept looking at us and laughing.\\
280 - Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Red told
Fenton that we knew a lot of chicks.\\
281 - 'Cause Fenton
kept checking me out,\\
282 - like he could tell
that I knew a lot of chicks.\\
283 - Eric, I can't believe that you
crippled my angel, my pride and joy.\\
284 - It kills me
seeing her like this.\\
285 - Then why are you
bringing her over here?\\
286 - Oh, I got a date. I met a
lady at the open house.\\
287 - She's got crow's feet, but
she works in a sandwich shop,\\
288 - so I bent the rules.\\
289 - Look, Donna, I'm so
sorry about what happened.\\
290 - You know,
I've been thinking about it,\\
291 - I don't think I ever really
wanted to be a chiropractor.\\
292 - I was just, you know,
grasping at straws.\\
293 - I'd nod in agreement
but, you know, I'm paralyzed.\\
294 - Eric, you know what
I'm realizing about you?\\
295 - You're not good at anything.\\
296 - That's not true, Kelso.
Don't forget butt wiping.\\
297 - Oh. You know what?
You guys suck.\\
298 - Whenever you're in trouble,
I don't burn you.\\
299 - I mean, you know, usually
'cause it's hard for me\\
300 - to think of things
right on the spot,\\
301 - but also 'cause,
you know, I try to help.\\
302 - That's actually true.\\
303 - I mean, Fez, remember when
you wanted to learn how to kiss,\\
304 - and Eric taught you by
sticking M&M's to the mirror?\\
305 - That never happened.\\
306 - I know how to kiss.
Shut it, Donna.\\
307 - Yeah, and, Kelso, how about that
time I stayed up with you all night\\
308 - to study for that math final?\\
309 - I mean, sure, nothing stuck, but,
you know, I blame nature for that.\\
310 - Yep, some people
you just can't reach.\\
311 - You know, Forman, if you
can teach Fez how to kiss\\
312 - and Kelso how to do math, you
can probably teach anybody anything.\\
313 - Why don't you just
become a teacher?\\
314 - That actually
makes a lot of sense.\\
315 - I mean, you have all this
knowledge about stuff\\
316 - you have no ability to do.\\
317 - A teacher? Well,
I do like helping people.\\
318 - I mean, I'd love to help kids.\\
319 - Yeah. Like, "Mr. Forman."\\
320 - That just feels really great.\\
321 - Yeah, a teacher.
That just feels so right.\\
322 - There it is. Forman's gonna be
a teacher. This calls for a toast.\\
323 - All right.\\
324 - To Forman.\\
325 - To Forman.\\
326 - What's going on?\\
327 - You guys are all too busy
to come to my party,\\
328 - and here you are,
having a party.\\
329 - For you.\\
330 - To Jackie.\\
331 - To Jackie.\\
332 - Okay, I don't believe you.\\
333 - But as long as I'm center
of attention, I'll take it.\\
334 - Jackie, grab a beer.
This is a great day.\\
335 - You graduated, they found
an apartment, and guess what?\\
336 - I'm gonna be a teacher.\\
337 - Eric, you know
what you should teach?\\
338 - Butt wiping.\\
339 - Fez, that was
really inappropriate.\\
340 - Eric, you should teach history.\\
341 - The history of butt wiping.\\
342 - - How's your neck, honey?
- Oh, it still hurts.\\
343 - Come over here. I'm a
nurse. I know what to do.\\
344 - Take two of these.\\
345 - Are you sure this
is for neck pain?\\
346 - Neck pain, headaches, bad days,\\
347 - they take the edge off
of everything.
\subsection {Episode 21: 2120 So. Michigan Ave.}
1 - That was probably our
second-best potato chip war ever.\\
2 - What the hell?\\
3 - We'll clean it up later, dude.\\
4 - I'm not your "dude," and
you never clean anything up.\\
5 - Well, we mean to,
but then we leave,\\
6 - and then we come back
and it's already cleaned up.\\
7 - You eat my food, you dirty up my
house, and every time I go into a bedroom,\\
8 - I have to wonder about finding
one of you naked with some poor girl.\\
9 - Well, at least you know that if you
find me naked in a room, I'm by myself.\\
10 - All right, I want everybody
who doesn't live in this house\\
11 - to get out now.\\
12 - Well, you're a real bummer, man.\\
13 - Come on, Fez,
let's go to our new apartment\\
14 - where people can do whatever
they want, whenever they want.\\
15 - Just like the Bible says, "Let my
people do whatever they want."\\
16 - Eric, the high school
sent over your transcript,\\
17 - which means you can start
applying to teachers college.\\
18 - Now, you tell me what school
you wanna go to,\\
19 - and I will send them a pie.\\
20 - Because you cannot eat a lady's pie
and then not let her son into the school.\\
21 - I gotta admit, Forman,\\
22 - it's nice finally seeing you
do something with your life.\\
23 - Almost inspires me
to make my record store\\
24 - the best damn
store in the region.\\
25 - Nah.\\
26 - It says here that Eric got
an "I-N-C" in gym class.\\
27 - "I-N-C"? I bet that
stands for "incredible."\\
28 - - Kitty, it's "incomplete."
- I know, you have
to add the "redible."\\
29 - "You have failed to meet the
requirements for graduation.\\
30 - "To receive your diploma, you
must attend summer session PE."\\
31 - Ha.\\
32 - "Ha"?\\
33 - I didn't graduate and all
you have to say is "ha"?\\
34 - Oh, and also "hee-hee."\\
35 - This sucks.\\
36 - Yep, but you have to
remember one thing, Forman,\\
37 - it only sucks for you.\\
38 - Hanging out\\
39 - Down the street\\
40 - The same old thing\\
41 - We did last week\\
42 - Not a thing to do\\
43 - But talk to you\\
44 - We're all all right\\
45 - We're all all right\\
46 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
47 - I can't believe I'm back in gym,\\
48 - or as I like to call it, "The
institute of things I can't do."\\
49 - Casey Kelso?\\
50 - Hey there, Pinciotti.\\
51 - Wow, look who you got
with you, little Foreplay.\\
52 - Yep, that's me.
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.\\
53 - Ms. Forman. God, you get
younger every time I see you.\\
54 - - Oh, me, too.
- Yeah.\\
55 - Yeah. Yeah.\\
56 - Pinciotti,
you're looking so good.\\
57 - I'm sorry I ever
broke up with you.\\
58 - The thing is, see,
I got this tendency to, uh...\\
59 - - No. What's the word?
- "Smoulder"?\\
60 - I think the word you're looking
for is "ditch, bail, run away"?\\
61 - No, no.\\
62 - Oh, wait, did you say "bail"?
Yeah. Yeah.\\
63 - So, Casey, how did we get
so lucky to see you here today?\\
64 - A little bit sweaty.\\
65 - Well, I'm the teacher.\\
66 - No way!\\
67 - That's funny.
It looks like a normal gym,\\
68 - but apparently I've stumbled
into the mouth of hell.\\
69 - Yeah, see, the coach
needed someone to fill in,\\
70 - so he called the best quarterback
that Point Place High ever had.\\
71 - And I figured, you know, the
cheerleaders, they practise in here,\\
72 - so it'd give me a good chance to
see what's gonna be on the market\\
73 - in a couple years.\\
74 - I can't believe that you get to decide
whether or not I graduate high school.\\
75 - Well, look, I'll tell you what,\\
76 - you give me one pull-up over
there, I'll tell the school you passed.\\
77 - - Okay.
- Okay, let's get
this done, Foreplay.\\
78 - Get over there.\\
79 - Hey, Pinciotti, you see all these
eighth grade boys checking you out?\\
80 - No, they're not. Really?\\
81 - Hi, boys.\\
82 - All righty, let's get this done.\\
83 - Here we go.\\
84 - Just getting in
a really good stretch here.\\
85 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me
show you how it's done, Foreplay.\\
86 - I don't know, man,
it's trickier than it looks.\\
87 - You real...
Oh, you got it. Good. Yeah.\\
88 - That's what I was going for.\\
89 - Is it hot in here or what?\\
90 - Okay, Fez, this bedroom's clearly
better 'cause it has its own bathroom,\\
91 - so I'm gonna go ahead and be
the bigger man and give it to myself.\\
92 - But I need a room
with its own bathroom.\\
93 - Otherwise I'm gonna have to walk
through the living room when, you know,\\
94 - when I have a moment
with myself.\\
95 - - That's too bad. I want it.
- I want it.\\
96 - - Well, I want it.
- I want it.\\
97 - - I want it!
- I'll kill you.\\
98 - What?\\
99 - Okay, wait, wait.\\
100 - Fine, you can take it.\\
101 - I don't want it anyway. I was in
there earlier and I heard voices.\\
102 - Voices?\\
103 - What kind of voices?\\
104 - Well, they weren't unfriendly.
They kept saying, "Get out."\\
105 - I don't want the haunted room.\\
106 - - Well, I don't want it.
- Well, I don't want it.\\
107 - Okay, fine.\\
108 - I'll take the room of death.\\
109 - - But you owe me one.
- Thanks, man.\\
110 - - Hi, boys.
- Hey.\\
111 - I brought you a housewarming
gift. Glass grapes.\\
112 - Every so often
someone tries to eat one,\\
113 - it's a real
conversation starter.\\
114 - I remember.\\
115 - You know, it looks like you
might need some help unpacking.\\
116 - - Kitty, no.
- Oh, just sit. I'll just be a minute.\\
117 - But remember, you are a
guest in these kids' home.\\
118 - Just like they've been a guest
in our home for years.\\
119 - Yeah.\\
120 - I'm a guest.\\
121 - Just like they've been
guests in my house.\\
122 - - Hey, that was my programme.
- Yeah, that's a bummer.\\
123 - Oops.\\
124 - What kind of animal just
dumps food on someone's couch?\\
125 - I'll clean it up later, dude.\\
126 - Okay, that's it.
You're going down.\\
127 - Or, I mean, I'm coming up.\\
128 - Yeah. Let's not pretend like this
is gonna happen, okay, Forehead?\\
129 - Forehead? That's... Come
on, man, that's not even good.\\
130 - They're all good
to me, Forehead.\\
131 - But, tell you what, I'll pass
you if you can tell me one thing.\\
132 - How's a guy that
can't even do one pull-up\\
133 - get someone like Donna?\\
134 - Wow. You know,
at least I'm not the dillhole\\
135 - who's strutting around the gym
with my whistle,\\
136 - thinking I'm all cool because I'm teaching
summer school PE to a bunch of botards.\\
137 - Yeah, I think it's really weird that
you'd say that to me, Forehead,\\
138 - especially since I was just
about to sign your transcript,\\
139 - but I don't know, now it
seems like I've lost my pen.\\
140 - You didn't lose...\\
141 - Okay, listen up.\\
142 - I wanna teach you all a
little game. It's called Target.\\
143 - Ooh. What's Target?\\
144 - All right, all moved in. Chateau
Kelso is open for business.\\
145 - You know, "chateau"
is German for "mister."\\
146 - Michael, you should have
gotten the room with the bathroom.\\
147 - You earned it by being
born better looking.\\
148 - Oh, well, I could have had it,\\
149 - but Fez said that there were
evil spirits in there,\\
150 - so I made him take it.\\
151 - Sucker.\\
152 - Man, I can't believe
you fell for that.\\
153 - Especially after that time he told
you evil spirits lived in that hot dog\\
154 - and then you gave him that.\\
155 - Wait, are you saying
he's tricking me?\\
156 - Foreigners always lie.\\
157 - That's how the Indians tricked
us into buying New Mexico.\\
158 - You boys are gonna
need a plumber.\\
159 - I tried to flush your pillow
down the toilet, it just wouldn't go.\\
160 - Ooh! Matches.\\
161 - Hi, honey. How was
your first day at school?\\
162 - It was awful. Casey's
definitely gonna fail me.\\
163 - Oh, that doesn't
sound like my Casey.\\
164 - I mean, the world's Casey.\\
165 - Man, it's like I finally figured
out what I wanna do with my life,\\
166 - and now I might
never be able to do it.\\
167 - And, might I add,
through no fault of my own.\\
168 - Eric, the last time you used the
phrase "through no fault of my own"\\
169 - was when you said,
"Donna, your cat's dead\\
170 - "through no fault of my own."\\
171 - Which I later found out meant,
"Donna, I ran over your cat."\\
172 - What did you do in class?
Were you being a porky mouth?\\
173 - What?\\
174 - No. A little bit, yeah.\\
175 - Well, there's only
one thing to do.\\
176 - I'm gonna have to put on some
lipstick and go apologize to Casey.\\
177 - Fez, you made up
all that stuff about the room.\\
178 - And I want the room,
so give it back.\\
179 - - You give it back.
- You give it back.\\
180 - - You give it back.
- You give it back.\\
181 - - Hi, Casey.
- Hey.\\
182 - - Look, I wanted to
talk to you about Eric.
- Who?\\
183 - - Foreplay.
- Oh, yeah.\\
184 - Look, I want to know if you can just
go ahead and let him get his diploma,\\
185 - because it's really important
to him and me.\\
186 - There might be one way
I can pass the little guy.\\
187 - All right? You know, all you gotta do is,
you know, just go out with me on a date.\\
188 - - Casey, I'm with Eric.
- Who?\\
189 - - I'm not saying it again.
- Come on, one date.\\
190 - 'Cause I'm still trying to figure out
why I ever broke up with a blonde.\\
191 - I was a redhead then.\\
192 - Man, I gotta start
paying attention.\\
193 - So get this, I went down
to the gym to talk to Casey,\\
194 - and he said that the only way he'd
pass you is if I go out on a date with him.\\
195 - What?\\
196 - Oh, thank you, Donna, thank you.\\
197 - So you'd let me go out with him?\\
198 - Well, Donna, if you really
loved me, I mean,\\
199 - you'd date other men.\\
200 - Get bent.\\
201 - Now, if she really loved me,
she'd date other women.\\
202 - Okay, the competition for
who gets the better bedroom\\
203 - is gonna be based on
the Miss America pageant.\\
204 - Ooh, I'll be Miss Texas.\\
205 - That bitch always wins.\\
206 - Okay, the first event is the
talent portion of the competition.\\
207 - Okay.\\
208 - Judges, I present you
with a dramatic scene\\
209 - from the major motion picture
The Godfather.\\
210 - "There's an entire horse
in my bed.\\
211 - "Why would you do this,
Godfather. Why?"\\
212 - And then the horse says,
"Let this be a warning."\\
213 - The horse doesn't talk, Kelso.\\
214 - Oh. I was thinking of Jaws.
"Look at my jaw."\\
215 - Fez, you're up.\\
216 - I think we're gonna give
this round to the foreign kid.\\
217 - - I just ran into Donna.
- Oh, was she on
a date with Casey?\\
218 - No, and she doesn't seem
too happy with you.\\
219 - I don't know why she's so mad.\\
220 - Well, you'll often find,
as you go through life,\\
221 - that when you try to turn
your girlfriend into a prostitute,\\
222 - she gets cranky.\\
223 - Okay, but, Dad, passing PE\\
224 - is all that's standing between
me and the rest of my life.\\
225 - You're lucky this table is standing
between my foot and your ass.\\
226 - Now you go down there
with Donna and do a pull-up,\\
227 - and earn the respect of that
woman who inexplicably loves you.\\
228 - You know what?
You're right, I gotta do this.\\
229 - I can do this.\\
230 - I just gotta be
like Luke in Star Wars.\\
231 - I just have to
really believe that I can.\\
232 - Yeah, but I don't believe I
can, so this is nothing like that.\\
233 - - Any tricks
to doing a pull-up?
- Yes.\\
234 - You pull\\
235 - up.\\
236 - Thanks, Obi-Wan.\\
237 - Eric, what are we doing here?\\
238 - You gonna make me sell a
kidney so you can pass math?\\
239 - No, we're here
because I'm a man, damn it.\\
240 - Hey, buddy, guess what?\\
241 - You're not taking my
girlfriend out. Guess why?\\
242 - 'Cause I'm about to pass gym,
fair and square,\\
243 - on the basis of my own strength.\\
244 - Side bar.\\
245 - - What are you doing?
- I'm doing a pull-up, woman.\\
246 - Wow, it looks like somebody really
had their Wheaties this morning.\\
247 - Actually, I had Cocoa Puffs.\\
248 - So I'm cuckoo, man, cuckoo.\\
249 - Donna, stand back,\\
250 - mostly because I'm gonna be
kicking my legs a lot.\\
251 - - You can do it, Eric.
- Never gonna happen, Foreplay.\\
252 - Foreplay.
Foreplay. Foreplay.\\
253 - It's not, Foreplay.
It's Forman.\\
254 - - Eric, you did it.
- Wow, congratulations.\\
255 - So, we going out or what?\\
256 - Look, stay away from my girl,
okay, Casey Kelso?\\
257 - Or wait, maybe I should say
Casey Smellso.\\
258 - "Smellso"? Wow,
that's really cold, Forman.\\
259 - You know, I'm just gonna go
sign your transcript 'cause\\
260 - I don't think I wanna hang out
any more, okay?\\
261 - Eric, I am so proud of you.\\
262 - I'd hug you back but...\\
263 - Well, I can't move my arms.\\
264 - We're back.\\
265 - I told Red he had to fix the
very unsanitary thing he did\\
266 - with a pillow in your bathroom.\\
267 - So, we're gonna have to skip
the swimsuit competition\\
268 - because Fez won't promise
not to show us his wee-wee.\\
269 - So we're gonna go
right into interview.\\
270 - Each of you will have
to answer the question,\\
271 - "Why do you deserve
the better room?"\\
272 - Michael, you go first.\\
273 - Okay.\\
274 - Well, Judges,\\
275 - you may look in there
and see just a room,\\
276 - but I see a place
where I can raise my daughter,\\
277 - and watch her grow,\\
278 - and create memories,\\
279 - until the day that I see her
walk out that door.\\
280 - And then through the living
room here and out the main door.\\
281 - Michael,
that's really beautiful.\\
282 - Yeah, Kelso, real nice.\\
283 - Let me tell you
a story about a young boy\\
284 - who dreamt of one day
being in America.\\
285 - In a room just like that.\\
286 - And with a tear
in his eye he said...\\
287 - Which means, "I want it."\\
288 - "I want it."\\
289 - I want it.\\
290 - Well, now I vote
they both get the room.\\
291 - I guess the only way to solve
this is a foot race to the room.\\
292 - Go.\\
293 - It's mine!\\
294 - I got here first,
the room is mine.\\
295 - Gross! Old people sex!\\
296 - Red,
you said you locked the door.\\
297 - Sorry, dudes.\\
298 - Room's yours.\\
299 - One hundred.\\
300 - You know, I bet we could make it to
200 if that shirt wasn't weighing you down.\\
301 - Well, the only way this
shirt's coming off is if I get\\
302 - a kiss from the best-looking
lady in Point Place.\\
303 - Well, bring it in dreamboat.\\
304 - Oh, Casey!\\
305 - "Oh, Casey"?\\
306 - Oh, Casey, you see\\
307 - By the dawn's early light\\
308 - I just had the most
patriotic dream.

1 - Hey, great news. I'm on my
way to becoming a teacher.\\
2 - I filled out all my college
applications in red pen.\\
3 - That's a little...\\
4 - It's like a little teacher joke.\\
5 - Well, now, look at him,\\
6 - out of bed and doing something
productive before noon.\\
7 - Honey, you're like a Marine.\\
8 - A Marine? The only time
I ever saw him storm a beach\\
9 - was when he was
running away from a jellyfish.\\
10 - Dad, all I need from you now
is a financial statement,\\
11 - so the school can see where
I'm getting the old moolah.\\
12 - Oh, well, bad news, I...\\
13 - I spent your college money
to keep the muffler shop going.\\
14 - - What?
- This is really weird.\\
15 - Because my parents, instead
of paying for my college,\\
16 - bought me a muffler.\\
17 - Dad, how am I supposed
to pay for college?\\
18 - Look, with this damn mild
winter, nobody's muffler rusted.\\
19 - I tried to rust them.\\
20 - I went out at night and
sprinkled salt all over the streets.\\
21 - Not my good kosher salt?\\
22 - Yes, Kitty, I sprinkled
the streets of Point Place\\
23 - with your
half-pound bag of salt.\\
24 - Wait, Mom, you knew about this?
And you just said, "Please, go ahead.\\
25 - "Take my son's college money
and use it on a muffler shop"?\\
26 - No.\\
27 - I think your father asked me if I
thought you would amount to anything,\\
28 - and I said,
"I really, really hope so."\\
29 - And then he said, "I'm spending Eric's
college money on my muffler shop."\\
30 - And then I made the best
blueberry cobbler I have ever made.\\
31 - - Man, that was good.
- Best cobbler ever.\\
32 - Huh! I remember that cobbler.\\
33 - I always wondered why,
when I said it was so good,\\
34 - you said, "At least I can give
you this," and started to cry.\\
35 - Well, look at the bright side.\\
36 - There's always a place for you
at a failing muffler shop.\\
37 - So, the upshot is I have
absolutely no money for college.\\
38 - Eric, don't worry, there are plenty
of ways to get money for school.\\
39 - Yeah, man, you could always
get a football scholarship.\\
40 - Hey, look, he weighs about
as much as a football,\\
41 - and people do like to kick him.\\
42 - I know what you should do.\\
43 - You should go to Hollywood
and become the next Gene Wilder.\\
44 - That guy's a laugh riot.\\
45 - Eric, you should go see Mr.
Bray.\\
46 - Finding money for college is what
high school guidance counselors do.\\
47 - Yeah, they also spend a lot of time
staring at themselves in the mirror saying,\\
48 - "I can't believe I'm a high
school guidance counselor."\\
49 - I don't know about Mr. Bray. I
don't think he really liked me.\\
50 - One time I told him I was
being bullied, and he just said,\\
51 - "What'd you expect?"\\
52 - All right, I'll go with you.
He'll help. He totally loved me,\\
53 - in almost entirely
appropriate ways.\\
54 - Okay, I'm breaking up with Angie.
All we have anymore is hot sex.\\
55 - Hot sex?
All I have is hot soup.\\
56 - Can't make love to that.\\
57 - Too damn hot.\\
58 - So, Kelso, you gonna break
up with her your usual way?\\
59 - Send a note saying you got
kidnapped by kung fu robots?\\
60 - No, it won't work with her.\\
61 - She doesn't even believe in
kung fu robots.\\
62 - - Just gonna have
to talk to her.
- Whoa.\\
63 - Kelso, you never break
up with a girl to her face.\\
64 - You usually have me
tell her you're dead.\\
65 - And then when she eventually sees
you, you have me tell her you're a ghost.\\
66 - Michael, why don't you do
what you did with me?\\
67 - Toilet paper my house.\\
68 - No, I can't do that to Angie.\\
69 - I respect her too much 'cause she
agreed to have sex with me so fast.\\
70 - Look,
I don't care how you do it.\\
71 - I'm just happy you won't be
violating my sister anymore.\\
72 - Yeah, I know you hated it, Hyde.\\
73 - I would have broken up with her
sooner if I didn't find it so hilarious.\\
74 - Dude, you be nice
or I will marry her.\\
75 - Hanging out\\
76 - Down the street\\
77 - The same old thing\\
78 - We did last week\\
79 - Not a thing to do\\
80 - But talk to you\\
81 - We're all all right\\
82 - We're all all right\\
83 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
84 - - I'm so glad you
came by, Daddy.
- Well, I missed you guys.\\
85 - I'm not just your rich boss,
I'm also your rich dad.\\
86 - In fact, everyone related to me,
grab some cash from the register.\\
87 - I've already been in there
once today, but you're the boss.\\
88 - Okay, I can do this.\\
89 - I'm just gonna tell Angie that
things are fizzling between us\\
90 - and we should end it.\\
91 - - Hey, how's it going, sweets?
- Not bad, toots.\\
92 - Oh, him. Go, go.\\
93 - Okay, we need to
talk about something.\\
94 - This might be
kind of hard to take.\\
95 - Fez still wets the bed.\\
96 - - What?
- Ew!\\
97 - At least we're still together.
I'll see you later.\\
98 - I'm going to wet your bed.\\
99 - Hey, Angie,
can you recommend a record?\\
100 - Something Dean Martin-y
but not Dean Martin.\\
101 - 'Cause I don't like that he
didn't wave to me in Atlantic City.\\
102 - Well, I don't know much
about Dean Martin,\\
103 - but I do know that the top-selling
record this week is Blondie.\\
104 - A broad, huh?\\
105 - - She jazzy?
- Well, I know she's blonde.\\
106 - Here you go,
Bob, try this Joey Bishop.\\
107 - He swings like Dean,
but he'll wave at anybody.\\
108 - Good job knowing
the number one album, honey.\\
109 - I love watching you in action,\\
110 - because the more you work,
the less I have to.\\
111 - Well, I'm just trying to get ready
for the day you kick the bucket\\
112 - and I get everything.\\
113 - Just like her mother.\\
114 - Oh, my God, I can't believe I have to
tell my high school guidance counselor\\
115 - that I spent
an entire year doing nothing.\\
116 - He's gonna think
I'm such a loser.\\
117 - Oh, Donna,
let's tell him it's you.\\
118 - No, you're a much
more believable loser.\\
119 - Oh, come on, he won't
judge you. He loves you.\\
120 - I mean,
jeez, he asked you to prom.\\
121 - Okay, let's see... Donna.\\
122 - What a pleasant,\\
123 - pleasant surprise.\\
124 - Jeez, you've done something
different with your hair since the prom.\\
125 - Yeah, you noticed.\\
126 - Well, I notice everything
about all my students.\\
127 - I, like, put on a little weight.\\
128 - And you are?\\
129 - Eric\\
130 - Forman,\\
131 - 1977's most improved mathlete.\\
132 - Oh, right. Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Eric.\\
133 - I just figured the bullies
had gotten you.\\
134 - Anyway, Donna here is looking
for some college scholarships.\\
135 - Well, Donna,
you've come to the right place\\
136 - because I am an expert
at college scholarships,\\
137 - as well as
the affairs of the heart.\\
138 - Why don't you have just a
little seat right here, young lady.\\
139 - Thank you.\\
140 - I guess I'll...\\
141 - Great.\\
142 - So, Donna, to figure out what
scholarships you're eligible for,\\
143 - I'll have to know what
you've done for the last year.\\
144 - Oh! Um...\\
145 - Well, not a lot.\\
146 - I read comic books,\\
147 - - acted out movies
with my dolls...
- Action figures.\\
148 - Okay, you always insist that
they are called action figures.\\
149 - You know, if Eric had told me he
had wasted a whole year of his life,\\
150 - I wouldn't be surprised.
But you?\\
151 - I know, I'm just as
surprised as you are.\\
152 - It has been a long, ugly fall,
very hard to watch.\\
153 - In fact,
just between you and me,\\
154 - she's even gotten into a
little bit of the smoky, smoky.\\
155 - All right.\\
156 - Screw this.\\
157 - The scholarship is for him.
Eric, good luck.\\
158 - Mr. Bray, my coming here
was not an invitation\\
159 - to start driving
by my house again.\\
160 - Hey, my mother
lives right next door.\\
161 - I live right next door.\\
162 - Oh, well.\\
163 - How's Mother?\\
164 - Oh, my God, you guys,
I just got a promotion.\\
165 - Daddy says I've been
doing such a great job\\
166 - that he wants me to move to Milwaukee
and help run the corporate office.\\
167 - Wait, what about Steven?
He's the one doing the great job.\\
168 - You just sit around doing your nails
and making smart-ass comments.\\
169 - Jackie, that's you.\\
170 - Yeah, well,
it's annoying now, isn't it?\\
171 - How'd you get a promotion? You
don't know anything about music.\\
172 - Last week a guy came
in asking for KISS,\\
173 - you called him "pervert"
and slapped him in the face.\\
174 - Well, did your dad say
anything about Steven?\\
175 - I don't know, I just heard
the word "promotion,"\\
176 - and I got a little dizzy
and sort of blacked out.\\
177 - It was awesome.\\
178 - Well, here's the America I know,\\
179 - the person who can't do
anything rises to the top,\\
180 - while the guy who's working
his ass off gets nothing.\\
181 - Are you supposed to be the guy
that works his ass off?\\
182 - Don't make this more
complicated than it has to be.\\
183 - Jackie, listen,\\
184 - I need some advice on
breaking up with girls, okay?\\
185 - And you've been broken up with
a lot, and several times by me.\\
186 - So what didn't you like?\\
187 - Oh. Uh...\\
188 - The lying, the cheating,
the sneaking around.\\
189 - Oh, and I also didn't like Fez trying
to make out with me five minutes later.\\
190 - Well, then you're
really not gonna like this.\\
191 - Look, I don't know
how to break up with Angie.\\
192 - Well, why don't you try to
figure out how to do it kindly,\\
193 - maturely, respectfully.\\
194 - Yeah, that sounds nice.\\
195 - I think I'm just gonna sleep
with her best friend.\\
196 - Okay, I actually got some great
news from the guidance counselor.\\
197 - There's this program where you go and
teach in an impoverished area for a year,\\
198 - and then they pay
for your college.\\
199 - I signed up.\\
200 - - Eric, that's perfect.
- That's wonderful.\\
201 - See, I knew spending your college
money would work out for the best.\\
202 - You're welcome.\\
203 - So, what impoverished area
will you go to?\\
204 - Is it East Milwaukee?\\
205 - I made a wrong turn there once and
I ended up in an awful neighborhood.\\
206 - There were kids playing radios
on a street corner.\\
207 - No.
I'm not going to Milwaukee.\\
208 - - So, where then?
- Africa.\\
209 - Africa, Wisconsin?\\
210 - You're going to teach in Africa?\\
211 - What are you gonna teach them?
How to get eaten by an ostrich?\\
212 - Mom, an ostrich?\\
213 - I saw a documentary.\\
214 - They are vicious,
cruel creatures.\\
215 - Well, I think it's great he's going
to Africa. It'll make him a man.\\
216 - You think the only way
to become a man is to die.\\
217 - How are you gonna feel when
your son gets killed by a lion\\
218 - or a disease-carrying fly?\\
219 - You get killed by a fly, I'm
not buying you a headstone.\\
220 - You can't go to Africa.\\
221 - They don't even
have ketchup there.\\
222 - You put ketchup on everything.\\
223 - You'll starve to death.\\
224 - Can you believe
how much she's freaking out?\\
225 - No, I cannot believe that someone
you supposedly love is upset\\
226 - that you decided to go to Africa
without considering her feelings at all.\\
227 - See? Donna understands.\\
228 - So, there's a problem with my
sleeping-with-Angie's-best-friend plan.\\
229 - Angie's best friend is Hyde.\\
230 - You know what we
may have to do here?\\
231 - The dark room switch.\\
232 - You will make love to her in a dark room,
halfway through you will excuse yourself.\\
233 - Then I'll come in, pretend
to be you, and finish the job.\\
234 - - How does that fix my problem?
- I was working on my problem.\\
235 - You guys, Donna's totally
freaking out about this Africa thing.\\
236 - She won't return
any of my calls.\\
237 - I think I have a solution.\\
238 - The dark room switch.\\
239 - Look, man, tell Donna
to just lay off, okay?\\
240 - Africa is gonna be awesome.\\
241 - You know, they have this bug over
there that burrows into your brain,\\
242 - and it lays,
like, a thousand eggs.\\
243 - And then, when the eggs hatch,\\
244 - they, like, shoot out of your
head like little worm bullets.\\
245 - Kelso,
those worms aren't in Africa.\\
246 - They're on the planet Zorgon,\\
247 - which is from a comic book
that you wrote.\\
248 - Just trying to
generate a little buzz.\\
249 - WB, what the hell
were you thinking?\\
250 - I don't know, I thought I'd try
a new thing with my shoulders.\\
251 - Look, he means, why did
you promote that whore, Angie?\\
252 - - You mean my daughter Angie?
- I stand by my statement.\\
253 - You can't hit a girl.\\
254 - Look, if this is about me
not being professional,\\
255 - I've already told you, bottle
rocket Friday nights are over.\\
256 - Steven, I'm moving Angie to Milwaukee
to get her away from the customers.\\
257 - I love my little girl, but you're the
one who should be running that store.\\
258 - So, it's yours.\\
259 - Whoa.\\
260 - - Thanks, man.
- Oh,
my God, I own a record store!\\
261 - No, I own a record store.\\
262 - Actually, I own a record store.\\
263 - I own one-third
of a record store.\\
264 - Moving Angie here is
gonna work out for everybody.\\
265 - See, I just got into this
real snooty country club,\\
266 - and they don't think
I'm gonna be there much.\\
267 - But I'm gonna be there all day,
every day, and I'm bringing friends.\\
268 - So I need somebody around
here looking after things,\\
269 - while I'm out making
white people uncomfortable.\\
270 - Hello? Oh, hi.\\
271 - How are you?\\
272 - I'm Eric's guidance counselor. I just
came over with some papers for him.\\
273 - You look familiar.
Do you live around here?\\
274 - 'Cause I see you drive up
and down the street all the time.\\
275 - Yeah, well, I see you emptying
your trash in your bathrobe all the time,\\
276 - but I keep it to myself, okay?\\
277 - Eric, I brought you a brochure
with some survival tips on Africa.\\
278 - Funny, they don't have brochures
with survival tips on Wisconsin.\\
279 - That's because death isn't
hiding behind every bush.\\
280 - - Mom, please.
- I'm sorry if Eric's
trip has upset anyone.\\
281 - - It's upset everyone.
- I'm not upset,
I'm tickled pink.\\
282 - What about Donna?
How's Donna doing?\\
283 - I don't know.
She's not even talking to me.\\
284 - Yeah, well,
you know, sometimes I think\\
285 - she just kind of lets her fiery
emotions get the best of her.\\
286 - But I think maybe a gentle word
from me might just calm her down,\\
287 - or send her into
the arms of someone else.\\
288 - No, you know what?
You're not gonna talk to her.\\
289 - I'm gonna go talk to her.\\
290 - So, you guys have a daughter?\\
291 - Angie.\\
292 - I've been thinking about this all
day, and I finally worked up the nerve,\\
293 - and I think we
need to talk about us.\\
294 - Michael,
I'm breaking up with you.\\
295 - How dare you?\\
296 - I'm moving to Milwaukee.\\
297 - Well, when were you gonna
tell me, you know, your boyfriend?\\
298 - Come on, you know things
were sort of fizzling anyways.\\
299 - Fizzling?
How can you even say that?\\
300 - What about all the times you said
that I was really, really good-looking?\\
301 - Michael,
it's over, but know this,\\
302 - when I said you were
good-looking, I really meant it.\\
303 - You know what? You got
a lot of growing up to do.\\
304 - - Hey.
- Don't you "hey" me.\\
305 - My daughter stayed home
from college for you.\\
306 - She could've had
a bright future.\\
307 - Sure, she wouldn't be president
of a company or anything\\
308 - 'cause she's a gal.\\
309 - But she would have been
one hell of a secretary.\\
310 - Okay, look,
Donna, I know you're upset...\\
311 - Eric, if you wanna break up
with me, just go ahead and do it.\\
312 - What? No. Donna, I'm
not breaking up with you.\\
313 - Really? Well, did you consider me at all
before you decided to run away to Africa?\\
314 - Okay, look, Donna,\\
315 - the reason I'm
doing this is for us.\\
316 - Okay, so I can go to college,
and get a job, you know.\\
317 - So I can deserve you.\\
318 - Don't give me that crap,
you're doing it for you.\\
319 - Donna, when my dad got sick
and I had to stay at home,\\
320 - I thought I'd
missed my only chance.\\
321 - But this is it.
This is my second chance.\\
322 - And you're always saying
how I gotta get out of this town,\\
323 - how I gotta start my life.\\
324 - God, I thought if anyone was gonna
support me in this, it was gonna be you.\\
325 - So, good. Go start it.\\
326 - Look, I really just
don't wanna fight about this.\\
327 - What do you wanna do?\\
328 - Movie?\\
329 - And then what?\\
330 - I vote the thing
we usually do after a movie.\\
331 - What's the point of that?\\
332 - Well, I don't know. I think
that's really its own reward.\\
333 - I think you need to leave.\\
334 - - Donna, I'm not gonna...
- She said get out.\\
335 - I know 'cause I was
listening the whole time.\\
336 - Okay, fine.\\
337 - You still got me, cupcake.\\
338 - Thanks, Dad.\\
339 - If it makes you feel any
better, he's gonna be sorry.\\
340 - I read some place that in Africa they
got a bug that burrows in your brain\\
341 - and shoots out your eyes
like worm bullets.\\
342 - Okay, Angie, Kelso feels that you
two should have one last night together.\\
343 - And he wants it to be special, so
it will take place in this dark room,\\
344 - and for a minute you may
think, "Hey, this is not Kelso."\\
345 - But that's just
the liquor talking.\\
346 - I forgot to mention you will
need to drink a lot of liquor.\\
347 - You going to get the liquor now?\\
348 - Okay, I'll wait.
\subsection {Episode 23: Take It or Leave It}
1 - It's funny, Eric.\\
2 - I thought I told you to
clean out the Vista Cruiser,\\
3 - but what I must have said was,
"Go sit on your ass."\\
4 - No, I was there, Red. You definitely
said, "Go clean out the Cruiser,"\\
5 - but he just
insists on being defiant.\\
6 - Look, I'm sorry, Dad, but
something really important came up.\\
7 - I Dream of Jeannie did her blinking thing,
and now Dr. Bellows thinks he's a monkey.\\
8 - No, Dr. Bellows is a monkey
that thinks he's a doctor,\\
9 - that's what's funny.\\
10 - He's sitting at the desk
and stuff, but he's a monkey.\\
11 - You're a monkey.\\
12 - You're a monkey.\\
13 - Eric, I need that car to go
pick up Charlie at the airport.\\
14 - You're bringing
another guy here?\\
15 - We need another guy here like I need
another firecracker in my bathing suit.\\
16 - Well, until you learn
to stop wearing Speedos,\\
17 - you're gonna keep
getting firecrackers.\\
18 - Charlie's this
annoyingly nice kid.\\
19 - His dad and my dad were
drinking buddies in the Navy.\\
20 - We weren't drinking buddies. We
were finely honed killing buddies.\\
21 - Yeah, well, I never liked him.\\
22 - At the last Navy picnic, we
got teamed up for the egg toss,\\
23 - and he dropped our egg, on purpose,
just so these little sick kids could win.\\
24 - Those little twerps went home
with my goldfish in a bag.\\
25 - My goldfish.\\
26 - Yeah, well, Charlie's only gonna be
here a few days on business for his dad,\\
27 - and the last thing he needs is
to be exposed to you deviants.\\
28 - Whoa, Dad, we are not deviants.\\
29 - Jeannie's bending over!\\
30 - Let's go.\\
31 - You guys, I gotta talk to Steven
about something really serious.\\
32 - - Maybe she's pregnant.
- Maybe she cheated on him.\\
33 - Maybe she cheated on him
and she's pregnant.\\
34 - Oh!\\
35 - Steven, this TV producer called to
tell me he loved my public access show.\\
36 - And then he offered me a job at his
station in Chicago starting next week.\\
37 - Whoa. You're gonna take a job
and move to Chicago?\\
38 - No, no, not yet. Well, I wanted
to talk to you about it first.\\
39 - Oh!\\
40 - This is serious serious,
not funny serious.\\
41 - We should probably leave.\\
42 - But we won't.\\
43 - Steven,
this is my dream come true,\\
44 - but you are the most important
thing in the world to me.\\
45 - So I'm willing to give it all
up and stay here with you.\\
46 - But if I do that, I need to
know we're gonna get married.\\
47 - Jackie, we just agreed
not to talk about our future.\\
48 - But our future is
happening right now.\\
49 - Look, the station needs an answer
by noon on Sunday, and I do, too.\\
50 - Well, I don't know
what to say right now.\\
51 - I know this is
a sensitive moment,\\
52 - but may I offer
a word of advice?\\
53 - Run!\\
54 - Hanging out\\
55 - Down the street\\
56 - The same old thing\\
57 - We did last week\\
58 - Not a thing to do\\
59 - But talk to you\\
60 - We're all all right\\
61 - We're all all right\\
62 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
63 - Eric, you remember Charlie.\\
64 - Well, I remember a
perfectly tossed egg from me,\\
65 - an unconvincing
"whoops" from him,\\
66 - and the sound of laughter\\
67 - as some children ran away
with my goldfish in a bag.\\
68 - Eric, you put
some kind of spin on that egg,\\
69 - it was uncatchable
like a curveball.\\
70 - Ha. Your whole
story's unraveling, man.\\
71 - I can't throw a curveball.\\
72 - Dad, tell him.\\
73 - I'm gonna have to side
with my son on this one.\\
74 - He can't even
throw a straight ball.\\
75 - Charlie, I made you
a pancake smiley face\\
76 - with sausage arms and a
little scrambled egg cardigan.\\
77 - Where's my whimsical breakfast?\\
78 - Oh, well, since you decided to go
teach in Africa without consulting me,\\
79 - all you get is
a plain pancake breakfast\\
80 - with nothing smiling at you.
Nothing.\\
81 - - Morning.
- Hey, I smell bacon.\\
82 - Hey, boys, have you met Charlie?\\
83 - - Oh, hey. I'm Kelso.
- Hi.\\
84 - I'm gonna eat your breakfast.\\
85 - And I'm Fez, and just so you
know, I'm the coolest guy in this gang.\\
86 - All right, I gotta go to work.\\
87 - Charlie, if Eric and his
friends start to bother you,\\
88 - just hold up a book.
It's like kryptonite to them.\\
89 - Oh, hey, Donna.\\
90 - Are you still mad
about this whole Africa thing?\\
91 - Yep, but instead of pouting at
my house and being miserable,\\
92 - I decided to come here
and make you miserable.\\
93 - That's the spirit, Donna.\\
94 - Here, eat his bacon.\\
95 - You made me bacon?\\
96 - Yep, I just kept it
over here in America.\\
97 - Mmm. Bacon.\\
98 - Wow, who's she?\\
99 - Don't even think about it. Donna
is with Eric and then she's mine.\\
100 - And then she is mine.\\
101 - And then, right back to me
for another go-round.\\
102 - Hey, Hyde, I heard about
Jackie. What are you gonna do?\\
103 - Well, I spent all morning kicking it back
with my stash to see what came to me.\\
104 - But all that came to me
was a great idea for a movie\\
105 - that now I just can't remember.\\
106 - Is that what that smell was?
Aren't you afraid you'll get arrested?\\
107 - I'm a cop.\\
108 - You guys are crazy.\\
109 - The closest I ever came
to breaking the law\\
110 - was when me and my
friend, Toby, cut out of school\\
111 - five minutes
before the last bell.\\
112 - My heart was beating so fast.\\
113 - 'Cause you were naked?\\
114 - No.\\
115 - I don't get it.\\
116 - You know what, Hyde?\\
117 - Your problem is you didn't handle
Jackie's ultimatum like a man.\\
118 - Like, if Donna tries that with me,
I'm just gonna say, "Hey, guess what?\\
119 - "You don't get to tell me
what to do with my life."\\
120 - And then, depending on
how much steam I have left,\\
121 - I may even call her toots.\\
122 - Hey, Eric.\\
123 - You know how guys always ask me out,
but I say no because I have a boyfriend?\\
124 - It's true, she won't budge.\\
125 - Well, since you're going to
Africa, I figured, you know,\\
126 - I should be moving
on with my life, too.\\
127 - And there's this guy
named Kevin where I work,\\
128 - and he asked me out tonight.
I said yes.\\
129 - What? You're gonna...
Oh.\\
130 - I think I see
what's going on here.\\
131 - Looks like somebody's
caught the ultimatum bug.\\
132 - Okay, I'll play along.\\
133 - You're gonna go out
with this Kevin guy or what?\\
134 - Or nothing.
This isn't an ultimatum.\\
135 - Okay, I'm prepared
for an ultimatum.\\
136 - I need to figure out what I'm gonna
wear. Maybe that really short pink skirt.\\
137 - Oh, that's over at my place.\\
138 - - You have her skirt?
- Don't judge me, new guy.\\
139 - It feels so good not to be
the monkey in the middle.\\
140 - Dance, monkey, dance.\\
141 - I can't believe Donna's going
out with this guy from work.\\
142 - You know, I made a point
of going down there\\
143 - and spreading a rumor
that she had crabs.\\
144 - Don't talk to me, Forman.\\
145 - This whole thing with Jackie
is all your fault.\\
146 - How?\\
147 - Because I wouldn't have even
been in the basement last night\\
148 - when Jackie came over, if we had
gone to go play pinball like I wanted.\\
149 - But you wouldn't go.\\
150 - So now I gotta
figure out my entire life\\
151 - because you claimed the
change guy touched you weird.\\
152 - He put the quarters
right into my pocket.\\
153 - I'm tired of
messing with Charlie.\\
154 - He's not even reaching
for the ball anymore.\\
155 - Well, you know, if you want, we
can hang out at my dad's warehouse.\\
156 - That sounds great.\\
157 - - Really?
- No, shut up.\\
158 - All right, well, I have to get
down there and unlock the door.\\
159 - We're getting a shipment today.\\
160 - - Shipment of what?
- Beer. My dad owns a beer warehouse.\\
161 - - Your dad owns
a beer warehouse?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
162 - You can touch the ball now.\\
163 - You had to see Eric's face
when I told him about my date,\\
164 - he was all
nervous and surprised.\\
165 - It reminded me of his sex face.\\
166 - Donna, I don't wanna hear about
Eric's sex face. I'm upset enough.\\
167 - You wanna know what the best
part is? I don't even have a date.\\
168 - I made the whole thing up
just to mess with Eric's head.\\
169 - I wish I had manipulated Steven
instead of opening up my heart.\\
170 - Now I'm the vulnerable one
waiting for his answer.\\
171 - Yeah, I was a little surprised.\\
172 - I mean, the bitchy stuff
is your bread and butter.\\
173 - You know, I had fake pregnancy right
up my sleeve and I didn't even use it.\\
174 - Whoa.\\
175 - Holy crap. That's the
most beer I've ever seen.\\
176 - Let me just hit the lights.\\
177 - Let me rephrase that. That's
the most beer I've ever seen.\\
178 - It's the mother lode.\\
179 - It's like now I know
how the immigrants felt\\
180 - when they finally saw the
majestic skyline of New York City.\\
181 - Actually, Eric, most of the
immigrants arrived in the 19th century\\
182 - before
the skyline was ever built.\\
183 - I mean, beer!\\
184 - I... I...\\
185 - I don't know where to start.\\
186 - You know, the kegs are cold.
Why don't we start with the kegs?\\
187 - Hey, we'll handle this, new guy.\\
188 - We'll start with the kegs.\\
189 - There's nothing like drinking
beer straight from the tap.\\
190 - This must be why
babies love breast-feeding.\\
191 - Reminds me of an ancient
Chinese proverb. It goes,\\
192 - something, something,
something, crazy girlfriend,\\
193 - something, something,
drink lots of beer.\\
194 - Hyde, I don't think we're gonna
find the answer to our problems\\
195 - in a keg of beer.\\
196 - Unless they're at the bottom,
so drink up.\\
197 - I've been in this warehouse a
hundred times, and I never did this.\\
198 - Now I know why
my grandmother's an alcoholic.\\
199 - This is great.\\
200 - I'm gonna need a bigger mouth.\\
201 - Girls, please tell me
that Charlie is here.\\
202 - Wait, isn't he at
your house with the guys?\\
203 - No.
Oh, sweet Lord, they got him.\\
204 - You know, Donna, you should be out there
trying to keep Eric from going to Africa\\
205 - instead of sitting
here on your patootie.\\
206 - Well, I'm doing everything
I can. I even lied to him\\
207 - and told him I was out
on a date with another guy.\\
208 - Sweetie, that's amateur hour.\\
209 - God gave you a very full chest, I
suggest you start using it on my son.\\
210 - I cannot believe Eric went out. He's
supposed to be at home agonizing.\\
211 - Well, maybe they went out to buy
flowers for when Steven proposes.\\
212 - No, they would
have just sent Fez.\\
213 - They're out having fun, and that
is exactly what we're gonna do.\\
214 - Okay, here's what I don't get.\\
215 - Why would Sally sell seashells
down by the seashore?\\
216 - I mean, that's a terrible
location for a seashell stand.\\
217 - Yeah, I mean,
if she wanted to make money,\\
218 - she would sell
seashells by the subway.\\
219 - You know what she should sell
by the seashore?\\
220 - Shoeshines, 'cause
your sandals get so sandy.\\
221 - Sandy sandals.\\
222 - We should start a girl band
called Sandy Sandals.\\
223 - What's wrong?\\
224 - Well, sand reminds me of dirt,
and dirt reminds me of Steven.\\
225 - Jackie, I'm sure Hyde
will do the right thing.\\
226 - You know, I thought if I
really put myself out there,\\
227 - he'd see how much I love him
and say yes right away.\\
228 - And then when he didn't,
I thought,\\
229 - okay, well, maybe he'll take a
couple hours and then say yes.\\
230 - But now I think he's only taking
so long 'cause he's gonna say no.\\
231 - Donna, what if he says no?\\
232 - Jackie, if Hyde says no,\\
233 - then you and I get a van, and
the Sandy Sandals tour America.\\
234 - And in a nutshell,
that's what it's like\\
235 - to be on the debate team
at a Catholic high school.\\
236 - Yeah,
I love Catholic schoolgirls.\\
237 - They don't teach sex ed, so
they don't know what not to do.\\
238 - Yeah, maybe, but I never really
got together with any of them.\\
239 - Wait, you never...\\
240 - Wait,
wait, wait, everyone, wait.\\
241 - Before you start in on him,
let me just say,\\
242 - when I was a virgin,\\
243 - all I wanted was for one
person to say it was okay.\\
244 - And no one did.\\
245 - Neither will I. Freak!\\
246 - Okay, I finally made up
my mind about Jackie.\\
247 - I'm gonna marry her.
I'm gonna be Mrs. Jackie Hyde.\\
248 - I think you need one more beer.\\
249 - Could be.\\
250 - Virgin.\\
251 - Man, how do you not have sex\\
252 - with all those girls that are
always throwing themselves at you?\\
253 - That doesn't happen
to everyone, jackass.\\
254 - How dare she give me an ultimatum?
This is my life she's messing with.\\
255 - She can go to hell.
I will see her in hell.\\
256 - Maybe one more.\\
257 - One more couldn't hurt.\\
258 - Eric, I wonder what
Donna's doing on her date.\\
259 - Oh, you know what, man?
I don't care.\\
260 - She just wants me to come running
after her, and I'm not gonna do that.\\
261 - You know what? That is
totally the right move, man.\\
262 - Plus, it's, like, after 9:00,
so if you go over there now,\\
263 - you'll probably walk in on her and
that guy sliding all over each other.\\
264 - And if I know Donna,
she's moaning like a ghost.\\
265 - Okay, Donna does
not moan like a ghost.\\
266 - I could make her
moan like a ghost.\\
267 - You know what, guys?\\
268 - I'm a little confused,\\
269 - but I do know
that I love you guys.\\
270 - I really, really do.\\
271 - Hey, where'd Kelso go?\\
272 - Well, hello, toots.\\
273 - Back from your
date so soon, huh?\\
274 - Used to be you have
to buy a girl dinner,\\
275 - if you wanted her to slide all
over you moaning like a ghost.\\
276 - Okay, you know what? I didn't
have a date, but I should've.\\
277 - - Wait, so you lied?
- Yeah, I was pissed.\\
278 - I mean, all of a sudden,
you're leaving me.\\
279 - Well, look, I'm only
gonna be gone for a year.\\
280 - I don't care.
I don't want you to go.\\
281 - I mean, you've always been, like,
20 steps away from me my entire life.\\
282 - What am I supposed
to do without you?\\
283 - Look, Donna, this is gonna be
really tough for both of us.\\
284 - But, hey, you know what?\\
285 - The good news is,
when I come back,\\
286 - we're gonna spend all
this time together because,\\
287 - you know, you're probably gonna
have to nurse me back to health\\
288 - from some
horrible African disease.\\
289 - Look, you know I love you.\\
290 - - And we're wasting
our time fighting.
- I know. You're right.\\
291 - We should just enjoy
the time we have left.\\
292 - Yeah, I'm all for that.\\
293 - Well, it's not what I
had in mind, but okay.\\
294 - Wait, Eric, you're back.\\
295 - Where's Steven?\\
296 - Uh...\\
297 - Okay, he's passed out in
the back of a beer warehouse.\\
298 - You mean, he's not coming.\\
299 - He's gonna say no. Oh, my God.\\
300 - Oh, Jackie, I'm sorry.\\
301 - What?\\
302 - I'm too drunk anyway.\\
303 - All right,
you two, where's Charlie?\\
304 - Look, Dad, not so loud, okay?
We had a really rough night.\\
305 - Oh, I'm sorry.\\
306 - Where's Charlie?\\
307 - Who's Charlie?\\
308 - Last time I saw him,
he was on a stack of kegs\\
309 - claiming Mount
Schlitz for the US.\\
310 - Oh, crap, and he was a good kid.\\
311 - Now who am I
gonna spend time with?\\
312 - I don't know. Me.\\
313 - Don't be a smart ass.\\
314 - Well, it's almost noon.\\
315 - Guess I gotta go talk to Jackie.\\
316 - What are you gonna tell her?\\
317 - I don't know, man.\\
318 - I'm thinking about letting the El
Camino make the final decision.\\
319 - If it pulls to the left, marriage,
pulls to the right, nudie bar.\\
320 - So you haven't decided?\\
321 - No, I've decided.\\
322 - Steven?\\
323 - Jackie stopped by and
asked me to give you this note.\\
324 - Oh.\\
325 - It says she took the job in
Chicago and she left this morning.\\
326 - Oh, you poor baby.\\
327 - You know what?
I am gonna turn my back\\
328 - and let you go into the
kitchen and have a beer.\\
329 - That better be Charlie.\\
330 - Mr. Forman,
is this your daughter?\\
331 - I don't know who did this to
him, but they sure are clever.\\
332 - They put you in a dress, huh?\\
333 - Welcome to Point Place.\\
334 - Listen,
Charlie, about last night,\\
335 - I know you're thinking
you're getting picked on a lot.\\
336 - Hey, I know you guys
are just having some fun.\\
337 - Let me finish.\\
338 - Around here, I'm the
whipping boy, not you, me.\\
339 - - Okay.
- Let me finish.\\
340 - I do the drinking and I put on
the dresses. You got it, hotshot?\\
341 - - Got it.
- Would you let me finish?\\
342 - I'm finished.
\subsection {Episode 24: Short and Curlies (1)}
1 - Good morning, Mr. Forman.\\
2 - Charlie, didn't recognize you
without your schoolgirl skirt.\\
3 - Why don't you go drink
another warehouse full of beer?\\
4 - Then you can get out of
those uncomfortable boy things.\\
5 - Wow, he came in here,\\
6 - just attacked you
and completely ignored me.\\
7 - You must be the one
the prophet spoke of.\\
8 - Man, I really got off on the
wrong foot with your dad.\\
9 - It'll blow over. How long could
he stay mad at a kid, right?\\
10 - You know what? Later on, I'm
gonna find him and apologize.\\
11 - I'm sure he'll understand.\\
12 - Yeah. Hey, if you're looking
for a good conversation starter,\\
13 - just say we were probably
wrong to go into Vietnam.\\
14 - Here's your breakfast, Charlie.\\
15 - Oh, Eric, I didn't realize you still
lived here. I thought you left for Africa.\\
16 - No, I've been sitting here
for, like, 10 minutes.\\
17 - Then you better get going or
you're gonna be late for Africa.\\
18 - Okay, I get it, Mom. You're trying
to make me feel bad about leaving.\\
19 - Oh, are you still here?
I thought you were in Africa.\\
20 - So, my mom's doing this whole
passive-aggressive guilt thing\\
21 - about me going to Africa,\\
22 - which basically just consists of
her saying the word "Africa" a lot.\\
23 - Well, I believe that if you want
someone to know how you feel,\\
24 - it's better to use the
direct approach, like this.\\
25 - - Don't go to Africa,
dill hole.
- Ow.\\
26 - So, Hyde, speaking of
annoying women who hit,\\
27 - - have you heard
anything from Jackie?
- Nope. That's fine by me, man.\\
28 - I mean, who does she think
she is, giving me an ultimatum?\\
29 - "Marry me or I'm
moving to Chicago."\\
30 - And then she takes off before
I even give her an answer.\\
31 - Well, what's the big deal, man? I mean,
she pretty much let you off the hook.\\
32 - Yeah. I mean, you were
gonna say no anyway, unless...\\
33 - Oh, my God!
You were gonna say yes.\\
34 - No.\\
35 - What? No.\\
36 - Oh, my God.
You were gonna marry her.\\
37 - You were gonna marry her
because you love her.\\
38 - "Hey, Jackie,\\
39 - "you're everything this poor
little orphan boy ever needed."\\
40 - "Oh, my God. I really am."\\
41 - "Oh, my God."\\
42 - Hey, I don't love her.
You know what love is?\\
43 - Love is for losers who
are too afraid to be alone.\\
44 - Oh, no,
you're thinking of kittens.\\
45 - Hey, so, I gotta go.\\
46 - I'm gonna go wrap
your going-away present.\\
47 - Eric, you're the one going away.
You didn't have to get me anything.\\
48 - Yeah, well, I knew you were
gonna get me something,\\
49 - and I didn't want this to be awkward
again like, you know, Christmas.\\
50 - Well, I did get you something.\\
51 - Oh, crap,
I didn't get him anything.\\
52 - He leaves in three days.\\
53 - Oh, well, why don't you
just get him an ultimatum?\\
54 - It's free. You don't have to wrap it.
It'll totally make him wish he was dead.\\
55 - Yeah. Well, it's between that\\
56 - or one of those shirts that
makes him look all muscley.\\
57 - Hanging out\\
58 - Down the street\\
59 - The same old thing\\
60 - We did last week\\
61 - Not a thing to do\\
62 - But talk to you\\
63 - We're all all right\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
66 - Look at the blanket
I got for our new apartment.\\
67 - I found it in the dumpster.\\
68 - It's got lots of stains,
so it goes with everything.\\
69 - That is so awesome.\\
70 - I'm not even gonna ask what
you were doing in the dumpster.\\
71 - - Is Steven here?
- No, he went to work.\\
72 - Oh, but before he left,\\
73 - he was chucking everything you
ever gave him all around the basement.\\
74 - It was like a hailstorm of
stuffed animals and Abba records.\\
75 - Wait, what are you doing here
anyway? I thought you left for Chicago.\\
76 - Well, I would have, but my
mom took the car to Tijuana\\
77 - and won't be back till Cinco
de Mayo, whenever that is.\\
78 - So, until then, I need you guys to help
me avoid the horrors of seeing Steven\\
79 - so I can figure out a way
to get out of here.\\
80 - Well, that's too bad, 'cause I think I
hear him coming down the stairs now.\\
81 - Oh, my God. What do I do?\\
82 - Okay. Quick,
get down under the blanket.\\
83 - He's not coming down.
I made the whole thing up\\
84 - and now you're
under a stinky blanket.\\
85 - The stinky blanket burn!
That is awesome!\\
86 - Oh, that is disgusting. Oh,
this blanket smells like dog.\\
87 - That is because when I found it, it
was wrapped around a dead dog.\\
88 - Uh-oh, Jackie. He's coming
for real this time. Get down!\\
89 - Oh, my God!\\
90 - - I got her!
- I got her!\\
91 - I am gonna kick
you both in the nads.\\
92 - Well, you're gonna have to do it
later because here he comes now.\\
93 - - Oh, well,
now I don't believe you.
- Okay, then.\\
94 - Hey, come on in. Good to see
you, Hyde. What's going on, buddy?\\
95 - She did it again!\\
96 - I hate you.\\
97 - Oh, man,
we could do this all day.\\
98 - Yeah, I got nowhere to be, man.\\
99 - I got the best
going-away present for Eric.\\
100 - Okay, a pen and pencil set.\\
101 - That way,
he can write me every day.\\
102 - Well, isn't that just...\\
103 - Donna, a going-away gift
should be something special,\\
104 - meaningful, personal.\\
105 - Okay, like what? Clock radio?\\
106 - Underwear?
Some spoons? Help me.\\
107 - No, honey, like...\\
108 - Okay, before Red went to Korea,\\
109 - I had my sister take a sexy
boudoir photograph of me.\\
110 - I was wearing
nothing but a fur coat.\\
111 - Mrs.
Forman, you bad, bad girl.\\
112 - It was racy.\\
113 - You could see my knees.\\
114 - Hey, Eric.
We need something to drink.\\
115 - Our throats are all dry from laughing
over Jackie and the stinky blanket.\\
116 - Jackie and the stinky blanket.\\
117 - It sounds like a delightful
Hardy Boys mystery.\\
118 - I'll tell you
what the mystery is,\\
119 - why aren't those boys
nailing Nancy Drew?\\
120 - 'Cause she's got glasses.\\
121 - Mystery solved.\\
122 - So, I gotta go over to Donna's,
get my going-away present.\\
123 - Man, she is, like,
the world's worst gift giver.\\
124 - Remember that ugly sweater
vest and that huge man ring?\\
125 - Now I gotta go get excited
about some other lame thing.\\
126 - "Oh, wow, Donna, clown shoes.
Thank you so much."\\
127 - I wish I had a beautiful girl
giving me clown shoes.\\
128 - Hell, I'd settle for a beautiful
clown giving me girl shoes.\\
129 - I dated a clown once.\\
130 - But soon as I learned how to make
those balloon animals, I dumped her.\\
131 - Excuse me, Mr. Forman...\\
132 - What the hell?\\
133 - Well, that was exciting.\\
134 - Mr. Forman, I was looking for you to
apologize about the dress thing, okay?\\
135 - But then I opened
the door and wow.\\
136 - No, no, I don't mean, "Wow."
I mean, "Oh, no!"\\
137 - No,
no, I don't mean, "Oh, no."\\
138 - Well, what were you doing
just standing there?\\
139 - I was like a deer caught in the
headlights. Oh, I said, "headlights."\\
140 - Red, it was a very
awkward situation.\\
141 - No one knew what to do.\\
142 - Well, I know what I would do
if I saw you naked.\\
143 - I'd turn and run the other way.\\
144 - I mean,
there is no reason on Earth\\
145 - for a 19-year-old boy to be
staring at a woman your age.\\
146 - Look, damn it, he's the
one in trouble here, not me.\\
147 - Hey, Kitty, could I have some peanut
oil? I'm gonna fry up some jumbo shrimp,\\
148 - which is a funny name. It's like
calling someone a giant midget.\\
149 - I'd like to see one of those.\\
150 - Get this, Bob.\\
151 - Charlie here walked into our
bedroom and saw Kitty naked.\\
152 - How was that?\\
153 - Well, how do you think it was?
It was horrifying.\\
154 - Excuse me?\\
155 - So, Mr. Forman, how wrong was
it for us to get into Vietnam, huh?\\
156 - Uh-oh. Jackie, Hyde's coming
for real this time.\\
157 - Quick, drink this old root beer.\\
158 - You know what? I am so tired
of you two lying about Steven\\
159 - just so you can humiliate me.\\
160 - Okay, you're right.
Let me make it up to you\\
161 - by offering you this
different, not old root beer.\\
162 - Jackie,
Hyde is coming right now.\\
163 - You know what, Michael?
I am sorry,\\
164 - but I am not playing
your little game anymore.\\
165 - Jackie.\\
166 - Why aren't you in Chicago?\\
167 - Why do you smell
like a dead dog?\\
168 - Okay, Donna, I'm ready
for my going-away present.\\
169 - Yahoo.\\
170 - All right, here I come.\\
171 - Holy Mother of Skywalker.\\
172 - You can do whatever you want
to Princess Leia.\\
173 - Her force field is down.\\
174 - Donna, this is the best... Wait a second,
Leia doesn't have a force field. She...\\
175 - You know what? I'm too
excited to quibble. Come here.\\
176 - I thought you left town.\\
177 - Why? Because you're
so amazing and incredible\\
178 - that I simply couldn't exist
in the same town as you\\
179 - knowing you couldn't
make a commitment?\\
180 - No, because you wrote me a
note saying that you left town.\\
181 - Oh!\\
182 - Well,
that, Steven, was a metaphor,\\
183 - a metaphor for the fact that
my heart and mind are gone,\\
184 - but my body is still here,\\
185 - in this very awkward situation.\\
186 - Want me to cover you up
with the stinky blanket?\\
187 - Would you guys get lost?\\
188 - Oh, you want your privacy.
I understand.\\
189 - We're just gonna go upstairs
and listen through the vent.\\
190 - So, what are you doing here, Jackie?
You got something you wanna say to me?\\
191 - Yes.\\
192 - I wanted to say that I'm
leaving for real this time.\\
193 - So you came back to tell
me that you're leaving again?\\
194 - Yes, but this is goodbye.\\
195 - All right,
I'll see you tomorrow then.\\
196 - Steven, I'm serious.\\
197 - So want to hang out next week?\\
198 - I'm going.\\
199 - Unless...\\
200 - Unless, Steven, there's
something you'd like to say,\\
201 - in which case, I'm listening.\\
202 - Yeah.\\
203 - Have a good trip.\\
204 - I will.\\
205 - Can you guys stand
closer to the vent and talk louder?\\
206 - Wow, so, it's like,
I can do anything I want?\\
207 - Can I touch your buns?\\
208 - What? You wanna touch my butt?\\
209 - No, not those buns. You know,\\
210 - the buns.\\
211 - Eric, that seems kind of weird.\\
212 - Yeah. You know what?
That is, like, a little weird.\\
213 - Maybe I'll just rub my face
up against one of them?\\
214 - Okay.\\
215 - Leia.\\
216 - Oh, Leia.\\
217 - Donna, meet me downstairs
for fried shrimp in T-minus 20 seconds.\\
218 - Wear an old shirt.
These things are greasy.\\
219 - Wow, that's almost enough to take
you right out of the moment, huh?\\
220 - Okay, Donna. From now on,
the only thing I'd like you to say is,\\
221 - "Use the force, Eric."\\
222 - - Okay, that seems kind of...
- Donna.\\
223 - Use the force, Eric.\\
224 - Man, and now Mr. Forman is even
madder at me since I saw Mrs. Forman naked.\\
225 - I mean, doesn't he know
I went to Catholic school?\\
226 - I don't even know what
any of that stuff is.\\
227 - Now what exactly did you see?\\
228 - And I'm only asking because I find
Ms. Kitty attractive in a sexual way.\\
229 - I know how you can get back
on Red's good side.\\
230 - Walk in on him naked.\\
231 - No way, man. I do know what
that stuff is, and I don't want to see it.\\
232 - No, seriously.
Look, it's perfect.\\
233 - Look, Red assumes that everyone
is either a pervert or an idiot.\\
234 - - He thinks I'm both.
- He thinks I'm both.\\
235 - See, and if you
walk in on Red naked,\\
236 - he's gonna assume that you're
the biggest idiot in the world.\\
237 - That kind of makes sense.\\
238 - You know, you probably hear this
all the time, but you're really smart.\\
239 - I do hear that all the time.\\
240 - Hey, Jackie, how'd it go with
Hyde? Did he ask you to stay?\\
241 - No. But even if he did,
I can't stay,\\
242 - because I've got a career
waiting for me in Chicago.\\
243 - But I am stuck here in this
stupid place with no way out.\\
244 - Jackie,
you know what would help?\\
245 - If you eat this dirty Milk Dud.\\
246 - Shut up, Fez.\\
247 - Jackie, I'm here for you, okay?\\
248 - So I'll even give you a ride.\\
249 - Really?
Michael, that would be great.\\
250 - And I won't do anything,\\
251 - because frankly,
I don't have much to offer.\\
252 - You guys smell smoke?\\
253 - Everyone out of the house!\\
254 - I used too much
oil in the Fry Baby.\\
255 - The whole kitchen's
filled with smoke.\\
256 - Bob? Bob, are you okay?\\
257 - Yeah, I'm fine, but my shrimp are ruined.
So I'm gonna have to eat with you guys.\\
258 - I hope you're making
something good, Kitty.\\
259 - Fire! Fire!\\
260 - What the hell is on your head?\\
261 - I'm still wearing the helmet,
aren't I?\\
262 - What did you do to my daughter?\\
263 - Nothing.\\
264 - I was a perfect gentleman.\\
265 - I just squeezed her buns.\\
266 - I suggested a photograph,\\
267 - not a go-go dance
from outer space.\\
268 - I smell like smoke
from Bob's damn fire.\\
269 - If Kitty's looking for me, I
went upstairs to take a shower.\\
270 - Now's your chance
to catch Red naked.\\
271 - - He's gonna think
I'm such an idiot.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\\
272 - Give him enough time
to take everything off.\\
273 - You don't want to walk in on
him wearing nothing but socks.\\
274 - That would just make
this whole thing weird.\\
275 - Oh, boy.\\
276 - Get back here, you pervert.\\
277 - That boy just
can't get enough of me.\\
278 - Sorry my present
didn't work out.\\
279 - Well...\\
280 - I mean, we are alone now.\\
281 - And I think I know exactly what
might get you back in the mood.\\
282 - A little romantic music.\\
283 - Where were we? Oh, yes, you
were a prisoner aboard the Death Star.\\
284 - And I am the only stormtrooper with
the keys to your laser chastity belt.\\
285 - That's in the movie?\\
286 - Donna, it's implicit.\\
287 - God, I'm gonna miss you, Eric.\\
288 - I'm sorry. What was that?\\
289 - Use the force, Eric.\\
290 - All right, here we are.\\
291 - Good luck in Chicago.\\
292 - Michael,
this is the bus station.\\
293 - Yeah.
I said I'd give you a ride,\\
294 - and then under my breath I
whispered, "To the bus station."\\
295 - No, no, no.\\
296 - No. I can't ride the bus.\\
297 - Other people's butts
have been on those seats.\\
298 - Well, I'm not driving you all the way
there. That's, like, two hours away.\\
299 - Michael, you put this car in gear
and take me to Chicago right now.\\
300 - You know what?
You haven't changed at all.\\
301 - You're still just a spoiled little
princess who gets by on her good looks,\\
302 - and bitchy demands,
and mean and painful pinches.\\
303 - Yeah, well, you still
don't have any manners.\\
304 - A real man wouldn't let
the princess ride the bus.\\
305 - Well, you know what?
You're not even a princess.\\
306 - You're just a little bossy boss.\\
307 - That's right, Michael.
I'm the boss,\\
308 - and you're taking the boss
to Chicago right now.\\
309 - Ahhh! Fine!\\
310 - You're always
telling me what to do.\\
311 - I've missed this.\\
312 - Please, Mr. Stormtrooper,
I'll do anything you want\\
313 - if you only spare
the planet Alderaan.\\
314 - Eric, you have a line.
We rehearsed this.\\
315 - Wait a minute.\\
316 - Fez!\\
317 - But I just want to touch the
buns. Let me touch the buns.
\subsection {Episode 25: Til the Next Goodbye (2)}
1 - All right, here's your motel.\\
2 - You're gonna love Chicago.\\
3 - You never lived near the ocean,
but that's all about to change\\
4 - thanks to good
old Lake Michigan.\\
5 - Yeah, I just wish I
knew someone here.\\
6 - A friendly face, you know?\\
7 - Don't worry.
You're gonna be great.\\
8 - Oh,
boy, I got a long drive back.\\
9 - You know, that door's kind of
tricky. You gotta actually open it.\\
10 - All right, Jackie, do you want me to stay
and get a burger with you or something?\\
11 - Michael, it's like you're
a mind reader. Okay.\\
12 - Wait. No, keep going. Guess
what I want on my burger.\\
13 - Lettuce, tomato and ketchup
put on by a waiter born in America.\\
14 - Eric, you're gonna
love teaching in Africa.\\
15 - I hear the women walk around
with their hoo-hoos hanging out.\\
16 - Dad.\\
17 - - So did you get
your shots yet?
- Wait. What shots?\\
18 - The vaccines to protect you
against exotic diseases.\\
19 - I had to get them
when I was in the military.\\
20 - You were in the National Guard.\\
21 - What exotic diseases
were you afraid you'd catch,\\
22 - scaredy-cat-eating-pie-
in-a-Jacuzzi fever?\\
23 - Hey, I'm proud of my service.\\
24 - Somebody had to stay home
and hose down those hippies.\\
25 - You guys, I leave
for Africa in two days.\\
26 - How come no one told me
about these shots?\\
27 - Oh, goodness gracious, did I
forget to give you that letter?\\
28 - You know, when you get to be my
age, sometimes you forget about things.\\
29 - And sometimes you hide them in
the rarely used Mexican soup section\\
30 - of this gigantic cookbook.\\
31 - Mom, I need these shots.\\
32 - Africa is very strict about these things,
and they're not strict about anything.\\
33 - I mean, the women walk around
with their hoo-hoos hanging out.\\
34 - Kitty, you have no right to stand
in the way of someone's dreams.\\
35 - And if you don't
let Eric go to Africa,\\
36 - you'll crush my dream
of getting rid of him.\\
37 - Fine. Eric,
I'll give you the shots.\\
38 - A mother should support her son.\\
39 - Just know the needles
are big as sausages,\\
40 - and if I miss the mark by even
a hair, your heart might explode.\\
41 - But don't worry.
It only hurts till you die.\\
42 - Hanging out\\
43 - Down the street\\
44 - The same old thing\\
45 - We did last week\\
46 - Not a thing to do\\
47 - But talk to you\\
48 - We're all all right\\
49 - We're all all right\\
50 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
51 - Hey, Donna, look, there's something
really important I need you to do for me.\\
52 - Eric, I don't care if you're
going to Africa. I'm not doing that.\\
53 - Please don't let my mom plan
this fancy send-off for me, okay?\\
54 - I can just see her planning this
embarrassing farewell with, like,\\
55 - music and banners and,
like, doves.\\
56 - Oh, man, it's good to be home.\\
57 - Jackie was all
depressed and crying\\
58 - 'cause she didn't have
any friends in Chicago.\\
59 - So I had to lighten the mood
with some skee ball.\\
60 - Jackie hates skee ball.\\
61 - I didn't take Jackie.\\
62 - Well, that explains why she's called me
four times since she's been in Chicago.\\
63 - Three of those were to say
that she hates my outfit.\\
64 - How does she know?\\
65 - Eric? Jackie's on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.\\
66 - - Jackie wants to
talk to Forman?
- Yes.\\
67 - Now pick up because she's
been blabbering for 20 minutes.\\
68 - And I never noticed it
when she was living here,\\
69 - but she's not that interesting.\\
70 - - Hello?
- Hey, Eric? It's Jackie.\\
71 - Uh-huh.\\
72 - Look, I just realized you're
about to leave for Africa,\\
73 - and I won't get a chance
to say goodbye in person.\\
74 - That makes me sad.\\
75 - I mean, you've always been
very special to me.\\
76 - Okay, Jackie, if
there's a gun to your head,\\
77 - say the word "cream cheese."\\
78 - No, Eric, I'm just gonna
miss you is all, okay?\\
79 - So just take care of
yourself in Africa.\\
80 - Okay. I will.\\
81 - Wait, you want to talk to who?\\
82 - You want to tell
him you love him?\\
83 - Well, I don't know.\\
84 - You guys didn't really leave
on the best of terms.\\
85 - Okay.\\
86 - Dad, telephone!\\
87 - I don't know Eric very well, but
he seems like a heck of a nice guy.\\
88 - Eric? Eric is good people.
Is good people, yes.\\
89 - I'll never forget. It was
the hottest day of summer,\\
90 - and Hyde and Kelso dug a hole
then covered it with leaves.\\
91 - And they said, "Hey, Fez,
wanna see a pile of dead leaves?"\\
92 - So, naturally, I ran over.\\
93 - - What happened?
- I fell in and I
couldn't get out.\\
94 - And the sun was beating down.
So hot. So hot.\\
95 - Finally, Eric came over.\\
96 - And you know what
that magnificent boy did?\\
97 - He poured soda all over me\\
98 - because that's what friends do.\\
99 - And then the ants came.\\
100 - Hey, guys.\\
101 - Oh, Eric,\\
102 - about you leaving,\\
103 - I just want you to know that...\\
104 - Oh, here comes the waterworks.\\
105 - - Hey, Hyde, man.
- Hey, man.\\
106 - Listen, I wanted some tunes,
so I need to find a record store.\\
107 - - Leo,
you're in a record store.
- Whoa, that was fast, man.\\
108 - - So what are you doing here?
- I'm the boss,
man, which is ironic,\\
109 - 'cause I'm also the
least-motivated employee.\\
110 - So if you have
a whole record store,\\
111 - how come you've been
kind of mopey lately, man?\\
112 - I'm not mopey. I'm fine.\\
113 - Well, where's that loud girl
you're always hanging with?\\
114 - Jackie? She's in Chicago.\\
115 - Loud girl's in Chicago.\\
116 - Hey, that's why you're
sad, man. You love loud girl.\\
117 - Maybe I do. You know what?\\
118 - The only reason I'm admitting that is
because you have no short-term memory.\\
119 - You're gonna forget this
conversation when it's over.\\
120 - Hey, that's not true, man.\\
121 - Hey, guess what I found out?\\
122 - - What, Leo?
- Loud girl's in Chicago.\\
123 - Crap, it's almost time for me
to go get my shots.\\
124 - Yeah, why do I have to get shots
anyway? So I get Yellow Fever.\\
125 - I could use a little color.\\
126 - You guys, this might be
our last circle together.\\
127 - We're growing up.\\
128 - I mean, these two have jobs,
and Eric is off to start his life,\\
129 - and I'm doing more
shaving than ever.\\
130 - Eric, I know you're scared
of getting your shots.\\
131 - So I'm gonna be a pal
and get them with you,\\
132 - 'cause I owe you for that time that I
chucked that dead raccoon at you,\\
133 - and then it turned
out to not be dead.\\
134 - And then it bit you, and
then you kicked it back at me,\\
135 - and then it bit me,\\
136 - and then we both had to go
and get rabies shots.\\
137 - Remember, on the way to
the hospital, Kelso saw that dog,\\
138 - and he jumped out of the car
'cause he wanted to go pet it,\\
139 - but he forgot the car was
moving, and he broke his arm?\\
140 - That was the funniest, bloodiest,
most rabies-filled day ever.\\
141 - Look at us.\\
142 - Best friends
offering to help each other.\\
143 - You know, we always have
to remember this moment.\\
144 - What?\\
145 - Upstairs, now.\\
146 - I am in huge trouble.\\
147 - I can't believe that is what
you idiots have been doing\\
148 - in my basement all these years!\\
149 - I wish I had 2,000 feet\\
150 - so I could put 500 of them
in each of your asses!\\
151 - I'm shocked.\\
152 - The basement door closes and
out come the lighters and the drugs.\\
153 - And I am sure Donna's down
there bouncing around without a bra.\\
154 - It's like Amsterdam down there.\\
155 - Did someone
shove a vacuum up your nose\\
156 - and suck out your last,
lonely brain cell?\\
157 - What is going on in your head?\\
158 - I am so
disappointed in you boys.\\
159 - And here I thought it was my dryer
that made our clothes smell funny.\\
160 - Who taught
you how to do this?\\
161 - Was it those damn Beatles?\\
162 - All You Need Is Love.\\
163 - All you need is
a job and a haircut.\\
164 - And you, wipe that stupid smirk
off your dopey, dope-fiend face.\\
165 - Do you know what
drugs do to you?\\
166 - They shrink your brain
until one day you wake up,\\
167 - and you think you're Superman
and you can fly,\\
168 - and then you wind up jumping
off the roof in your underpants.\\
169 - Oh, this idiot doesn't need drugs
for that. He does that every Saturday.\\
170 - Well, this is the worst thing
that you have ever done!\\
171 - Eric, I am gonna make you...\\
172 - I am going to...\\
173 - Well, I can't think of anything
worse than sending you to Africa.\\
174 - You're going to Africa.\\
175 - Hey, Leo.\\
176 - So, I decided that tomorrow,
after I say goodbye to Forman,\\
177 - I'm gonna go to Chicago.\\
178 - Hey, loud girl's in Chicago.\\
179 - You should look her up.\\
180 - Good idea.\\
181 - Anyway, what I was
thinking is, while I'm gone,\\
182 - you could run the record store.\\
183 - It'd be fun, man, like the
old days at The Fotohut.\\
184 - You know, the film
place you used to own?\\
185 - Wait. Was it a little blue house
in the middle of a parking lot\\
186 - with a drive-up window?\\
187 - Exactly.\\
188 - I don't remember
that at all, man.\\
189 - Okay, Michael, Eric,\\
190 - pull your pants down
and lean over the table.\\
191 - I'll go get those
gigantic needles.\\
192 - I just hope somebody remembered
to bring them in out of the rain\\
193 - so they're not all rusty.\\
194 - Hey, Donna, I'm gonna need you
to help me pull my pants off.\\
195 - Fine. Turn around.\\
196 - Wedgie.\\
197 - Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say off?
I thought you said up your butt.\\
198 - I still liked it.\\
199 - - I can't believe
you're leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah.\\
200 - It's kind of weird spending
our last moments together\\
201 - bent over a table with
our naked butts in the air.\\
202 - This is how I
always hoped it'd be.\\
203 - You know, I was gonna say
that I'll miss you,\\
204 - but I'm not a nancy-boy.\\
205 - You know, Kelso, there's
something I want to say to you.\\
206 - Son of a bitch!\\
207 - Oh, that hurt like hell.\\
208 - That was the alcohol swab.\\
209 - Well, it was freezing.\\
210 - Well, this is it.\\
211 - Just have to make it past
Mom's farewell ambush,\\
212 - and then off to Africa.\\
213 - Actually, Eric, I
wanted to talk to you first.\\
214 - I don't know if you know this,\\
215 - but I've been looking forward to you
getting out of the house for a long time.\\
216 - Yeah. I believe your exact words were,
"It will be more glorious than D-day."\\
217 - Yeah. Well,\\
218 - you're my son,
and I'm your father, so...\\
219 - Here.\\
220 - That's your
pocketknife from Korea.\\
221 - You said if I ever touched that,\\
222 - I'd meet the same fate as
hundreds of other godless commies.\\
223 - Well, I want you to take it
to Africa with you.\\
224 - Really?\\
225 - Wow, Dad, that means a lot.\\
226 - And,
Son, I want you to know that\\
227 - I'm gonna miss you, and I
love you, and have a good trip.\\
228 - Wait a second.
What did you just say?\\
229 - I said have a good trip.\\
230 - No, before that.\\
231 - You heard me.\\
232 - Wow, this feels like
one of those moments when,\\
233 - you know,
normal people would hug.\\
234 - Thank you, Dad.\\
235 - - So, really,
any last-minute advice?
- Yeah.\\
236 - You lose that knife,
don't come home.\\
237 - Surprise.\\
238 - It's just you?\\
239 - Donna, this is
the best surprise ever.\\
240 - So, the Vista Cruiser, huh?\\
241 - You know, this is where
we had our first kiss.\\
242 - I know. I remember.\\
243 - - Wow.
- Well, it's gotta
last a really long time.\\
244 - This is weird.\\
245 - I mean, me leaving.\\
246 - It's like it's real.\\
247 - Yeah, but you're gonna be back
before you know it,\\
248 - and then we're gonna have
our whole lives to spend together.\\
249 - Listen to me, Donna,\\
250 - I love you so much.\\
251 - You know, you're my
best friend. And I...\\
252 - I love you.\\
253 - And thank you for not letting my mom
plan this, like, going-away surprise thing.\\
254 - I love you, too, Eric.\\
255 - And I'm sorry.\\
256 - - For what?
- For this. Okay, guys!\\
257 - Surprise!\\
258 - Mom.\\
259 - You know, who am I kidding?
I wanted this.\\
260 - Oh, Eric.\\
261 - Okay, Charlie, I'm gonna
put you in charge of this.\\
262 - If you ever wanna cheer
Fez up, here's a little trick.\\
263 - I got you.
I got you. Who got you?\\
264 - - Who got you?
- You do, Eric.\\
265 - Okay.\\
266 - Here you go, Forman.
A little going-away gift.\\
267 - Thanks, man.\\
268 - Hyde, this bag is empty.\\
269 - Yeah, I heard about the stuff
they have over in Africa.\\
270 - Fill that bad boy up,
send it back to me.\\
271 - Honey,\\
272 - I'm sorry if I smothered you.\\
273 - That's just what a mother does.\\
274 - But I've accepted that you're
leaving, and I'm ready to let you go.\\
275 - Oh, Mom.\\
276 - Mom, I'm really only allowed
one carry-on, so...\\
277 - Dad.\\
278 - Come on, Kitty. Come on.\\
279 - Eric,
I'm not real good with words,\\
280 - so I thought I'd say goodbye
the only way I know how.\\
281 - Hit it, boys.\\
282 - So long, Point Place.\\
283 - Oh, for Pete's sake. Come on.\\
284 - So long, Point Place.\\
285 - Come in.\\
286 - - Hey.
- Steven!\\
287 - What are you doing here?\\
288 - Nothing. I had some free time,
thought I'd check out Chicago.\\
289 - - How's it going?
- Good.\\
290 - Hey, do you want to go take a
walk, maybe get something to eat?\\
291 - Jackie, I checked. No one can see us
doing it from the parking lot.\\
292 - You're dead.\\
293 - I'm nude.
\section {That '70s Season how Season 08}
\subsection {Episode 01: Bohemian Rhapsody (1)}
1 - Previously on That '70s Show.\\
2 - Whoa. You're gonna take a job
and move to Chicago?\\
3 - Well, I'm willing to give it
all up and stay here with you.\\
4 - But if I do that, I need to
know we're gonna get married.\\
5 - Well, I don't know
what to say right now.\\
6 - She took the job in Chicago
and she left this morning.\\
7 - Jackie, I checked. No one can see us
doing it from the parking lot.\\
8 - You're dead.\\
9 - I'm nude!\\
10 - Mrs. Forman, what a great idea,
making a tape to send to Eric in Africa!\\
11 - Oh, please,
I am full of great ideas!\\
12 - When he went to camp, I sent
him a huge card with my face on it\\
13 - that says, "Mommy loves you."\\
14 - Well, it made him miss me so much he
begged to come home the very next day.\\
15 - Ah, yes,
the summer of 1,000 wedgies.\\
16 - Eric is going to be so excited
to hear some familiar voices.\\
17 - Oh! I do Porky Pig.\\
18 - That is all, people!\\
19 - Is Hyde here?\\
20 - No, Michael, you're safe.\\
21 - We still haven't heard from Steven
since he left Chicago a month ago.\\
22 - I don't even know
what I'm doing here.\\
23 - Hyde could show up any minute
and kick my ass.\\
24 - I really need a soda 'cause I
just ate a whole bunch of salt.\\
25 - Why is it so good?\\
26 - I don't know. Why don't you
ask Hyde? He is right behind you.\\
27 - That's not even funny!\\
28 - Okay,
then, let's start the tape.\\
29 - Hi, Eric, it's your mother.
I'm here with Donna and Fez.\\
30 - Hi, honey! Thank you for
the postcard with the monkeys.\\
31 - I'm still
bananas about you, too!\\
32 - Okay, let's see, where to start?
Well, your father and I were furious\\
33 - when we caught you boys
in that smoky basement.\\
34 - The minute you
left for the airport,\\
35 - we went down there to do
what the Feds call "a sweep."\\
36 - How dare you boys smoke up my
house when you know how hard I work\\
37 - to keep it
smelling lemony fresh!\\
38 - You morons just hung
vacancy signs on your asses,\\
39 - and my foot's
looking for a room!\\
40 - - Here it is!
- Found it.\\
41 - Two bags?\\
42 - I've never seen
those before in my life!\\
43 - Your son has a real problem!\\
44 - Kitty, I want you to take this
garbage and flush it down the toilet!\\
45 - I am just glad that we caught you boys
before this became an everyday thing!\\
46 - Is that all of it?\\
47 - Yes, sir, that's all of it.\\
48 - Now there is nothing left for us
to do but to smoke Candy Land.\\
49 - I mean, I mean, play Candysmoke.\\
50 - I mean... Ay, no!\\
51 - And so I flushed it all down the
toilet and everyone learned a lesson.\\
52 - Why don't you tell Eric
what else happened?\\
53 - - Oh, let me, let me!
- Give me that! I'll tell him.\\
54 - Kitty!
I found another one! Kitty?\\
55 - What the hell?\\
56 - What do you have
to say for yourself?\\
57 - I'm starving!\\
58 - Hanging out\\
59 - Down the street\\
60 - The same old thing\\
61 - We did last week\\
62 - Not a thing to do\\
63 - But talk to you\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - We're all all right\\
66 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
67 - I still can't believe Red caught you
in the bathroom with the guys' stash.\\
68 - Someone is getting a
tie-dyed apron for their birthday!\\
69 - No, I just... I wanted to see
what all the hubbub was about.\\
70 - I mean, I was skeptical about
Tupperware, and that was life-changing!\\
71 - Anyway, Eric, I suffered the consequences,
your father gave me a very stern talking-to.\\
72 - Kitty, when we got married,
we took a vow\\
73 - to be together through
sickness and in health.\\
74 - But nobody said anything about what
to do if your wife turns into a dope fiend!\\
75 - You're a nurse, for God's sake!
You know this stuff is bad news!\\
76 - Bad news isn't the half of it!\\
77 - Here are the facts. When the smoke
hits the brain, the cells start dying.\\
78 - This process causes impaired
judgment and hallucinations\\
79 - and a lot of other
wonderful things.\\
80 - Is it Eric going away? Is
that why you used this stuff?\\
81 - Kitty, if you were feeling blue,
you didn't have to turn to drugs!\\
82 - I would have made you a martini!\\
83 - What's so damn funny?\\
84 - Is it the big head thing?\\
85 - I hardly felt a thing.\\
86 - You ate a whole box
of uncooked spaghetti.\\
87 - I needed something crunchy.\\
88 - Anyway, Eric, the day you left,
Steven went to Chicago to see Jackie.\\
89 - When he got there, he walked in on
Jackie and Kelso, who were about to...\\
90 - Get busy.\\
91 - Have sex.\\
92 - Do it!\\
93 - Kelso told us the whole story
when he got back the next day.\\
94 - No, hardly
anything happened, okay.\\
95 - Jackie asked me to stay
'cause she was lonely\\
96 - and the next thing
you know, I'm naked.\\
97 - And then Hyde shows up
and kicks me out the door\\
98 - and so I had to drive all the way
back here in this dress that I found.\\
99 - All the truckers were flashing
their lights and honking their horns.\\
100 - It was pretty great.\\
101 - Man, Hyde is going
to kick your ass.\\
102 - I know, I got to get out of here before
someone kicks the crap out of me.\\
103 - You jerk! Jerk, jerk, jerk!\\
104 - Hey, hey! Watch the face!\\
105 - That's the paycheck!\\
106 - Jackie, aren't you
supposed to be in Chicago?\\
107 - Well,
I'm here to get Steven back.\\
108 - Uh, where is he?\\
109 - He's not here. He took off after
he caught you two about to...\\
110 - Do it!\\
111 - Oh, my God, this is horrible. I
quit my job, I lost my boyfriend.\\
112 - My whole life is ruined.\\
113 - Jackie, I'm really sorry
about what happened.\\
114 - I never meant
to come between you and Hyde.\\
115 - Let me ask you one question.
Are we back together or not?\\
116 - Oh,
you are just as dumb as ever!\\
117 - Okay, you know, you can insult me all
you want, but just answer the question!\\
118 - - No!
- No, you won't
answer the question?\\
119 - - Why not?
- Because we're not together!\\
120 - That's the reason
you won't answer the question?\\
121 - - No!
- Then what's the reason?\\
122 - And that went on for
about half an hour.\\
123 - Oh, hey, Kitty. I need to borrow some
butter or oil. Pretty much anything greasy.\\
124 - - Are you cooking?
- Nope, tanning.\\
125 - Hey, what's up with
the tape recorder?\\
126 - Oh, I'm making a tape to
send to Eric. Here, say hi!\\
127 - Don't give him the microphone!\\
128 - What's new, pussycat?
Whoa, whoa\\
129 - What's new, pussy...\\
130 - Hey, Donna! Boo! Boo!\\
131 - Dad, just say something normal.\\
132 - Normal doesn't put asses
in the seats, Donna.\\
133 - For the last time, there are
no seats anywhere around you!\\
134 - Oh, Red, honey, here,
say something to Eric!\\
135 - I'd love to.\\
136 - Son, I was out in
the garage the other day,\\
137 - I looked down and I saw
your old baseball mitt.\\
138 - And it made me think
what I always think.\\
139 - What a waste of money.\\
140 - Actually, Eric, you leaving
was very hard on your father.\\
141 - The next day he
just sat around moping.\\
142 - I feel like dancing!\\
143 - By the way, Eric, we gave
some of your toys to the church.\\
144 - Give up, Eric? That's a deck of
cards hitting a bottle of soy sauce.\\
145 - Eric, please come home. You
have no idea how much I miss you.\\
146 - I miss you, too, honey. I don't think
I'll be happy until I see you again.\\
147 - - Hey.
- Steven's home.\\
148 - Okay, Miss Kitty,
he doesn't like to be hugged!\\
149 - Don't you ever leave me again!\\
150 - I spilled my soda... Hyde.\\
151 - I don't know what to say, man.\\
152 - What about, "Ow"?\\
153 - Why would I say, "Ow"?\\
154 - Ow!\\
155 - I get it!\\
156 - Eric, Steven just hit Michael.\\
157 - And while I'm very disappointed
in Steven for hitting Michael,\\
158 - it
was very exciting!\\
159 - Come on, man, get up.\\
160 - Why? So you can deck me again?\\
161 - No, actually I'm fine now. Everything
I wanted to say was in that one punch.\\
162 - Come on.\\
163 - It was a good one, too.\\
164 - I peed myself
a little on the way down.\\
165 - I'm going to go change.\\
166 - Hyde, where have you been?\\
167 - Ah!\\
168 - I've been hanging out
in Las Vegas, my man.\\
169 - And I've learned this,\\
170 - you don't want to show up late to
a Don Rickles show with puffy hair.\\
171 - Well, you could have let
us know where you were.\\
172 - I was worried sick about you
and I am very...\\
173 - I got you this.\\
174 - A little tiny slot machine!\\
175 - It is so cute!\\
176 - Steven, you're back!
Look, we have to talk.\\
177 - About what?
How you nailed Kelso?\\
178 - No, about our relationship.\\
179 - Oh, okay.
I'll start. You nailed Kelso!\\
180 - You never gave me
a chance to explain!\\
181 - Because you nailed Kelso!\\
182 - Mrs. Forman, start taping! Eric
loves it when he screams at her!\\
183 - Steven, I never even
slept with Michael.\\
184 - Yeah, right. Because Kelso is
always showing up at my hotel room\\
185 - naked with a bucket of ice.\\
186 - You know,
this is your fault, too.\\
187 - Okay,
you two, just stop yelling!\\
188 - Go ahead.\\
189 - No, forget it.\\
190 - Well, I guess that's that.\\
191 - Well, that was horrible.\\
192 - Yeah, I know. Where the hell
is my little tiny slot machine?\\
193 - Red, can you please just do me a
favor and tell Eric you miss him a little?\\
194 - Oh, fine.
Give me the thing.\\
195 - Eric,\\
196 - this is a little hard for me
'cause I'm not real emotional,\\
197 - but I wanted to tell you that
your G.I. Joes were killed,\\
198 - in the great
Dumpster War of 1979.\\
199 - Well, your meatloaf
was lost in the great\\
200 - Make Your Own Dinner
War of 19... Today!\\
201 - Well, Eric,
now that I have a second,\\
202 - I should catch you up
on your new friend, Charlie.\\
203 - Okay. Who brought the beer?\\
204 - I thought you were
bringing the beer.\\
205 - No, you were beer, I was chips.\\
206 - - You were beer, I was chips.
- Fine. Give me the chips.\\
207 - I forgot the chips.\\
208 - You know what I forgot?
To stay home.\\
209 - You guys...\\
210 - How much do we love this guy?\\
211 - He's a prince!\\
212 - Charlie, it is so awesome
hanging out with you.\\
213 - Thanks, guys. It feels so good to
finally belong to something, you know.\\
214 - It's like the first day
of the rest of my life!\\
215 - The beer!\\
216 - That was a pretty
awkward landing.\\
217 - I hope he's okay.\\
218 - Yeah, of course he's okay.\\
219 - It's not like anyone has ever
died falling off the water tower.\\
220 - And so they renamed it the Charlie
Richardson Memorial Water Tower.\\
221 - Jackie, Hyde just needed to blow
off some steam. You guys aren't over.\\
222 - Well, if you won't talk to me,\\
223 - then maybe you'll talk to Mr.
Fluffycakes.\\
224 - Jackie!\\
225 - My magical horn senses that you're
sad and need someone to talk to!\\
226 - Great. Now he can't hear you.\\
227 - Hey, Jackie.\\
228 - Oh, what do you want?\\
229 - Man, I feel really bad about
the way things turned out.\\
230 - You and Hyde should be
together, okay? Go talk to him.\\
231 - Look, there is no point, okay?\\
232 - I'm starting to think Steven never
really wanted to be with me at all.\\
233 - This must be how ugly
people feel all the time.\\
234 - I wouldn't know
about the ugly thing.\\
235 - But I do know that he
does want to be with you.\\
236 - Why else would he drive all the
way to Chicago to propose to you?\\
237 - Wait, what?\\
238 - Oh, my God!
Steven was going to propose?\\
239 - I have to find him!\\
240 - Tell you what, that's the last time I want
to mess around with a girl with a boyfriend.\\
241 - Kelso, your hand is on my butt.\\
242 - Come on, he's in Africa!\\
243 - You know, Red,\\
244 - it really upset me this afternoon when
you wouldn't say anything nice to Eric.\\
245 - Well, I can see
how that would surprise you,\\
246 - what with nice things always
bubbling out of my mouth.\\
247 - Well, it would just mean a lot to
me to hear you say how you feel.\\
248 - Don't you even miss him?\\
249 - Well, let's say I did.\\
250 - I still wouldn't feel
comfortable saying it on tape.\\
251 - Well, would it kill you just to
say it to me here in private?\\
252 - Oh, fine! I miss him!
Of course I miss him.\\
253 - He's my son.\\
254 - Why do you always
make me say things?\\
255 - Yeah.\\
256 - I should be in the FBI.\\
257 - So anyway, Forman, ramble on,\\
258 - keep on keeping on, most
of all, my friend, rock on.\\
259 - You know, I never used to
understand that hippie jargon,\\
260 - but ever since my
"bathroom experiment,"\\
261 - I'm cool, man!\\
262 - Oh, okay, let me just
give you two some privacy.\\
263 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
264 - Steven, I am so sorry about
what happened in Chicago.\\
265 - I was alone and I
thought I lost you.\\
266 - Yeah, well, I can see
why you thought that.\\
267 - Look, why didn't you just tell me
sooner you wanted to get married?\\
268 - Because I wasn't
sure I wanted to.\\
269 - And now that I've thought about it,
I'm right, I'm not ready to be married yet.\\
270 - Yet? Oh, okay.\\
271 - Well, there you have it, Eric,\\
272 - Steven's not ready
to get married yet.\\
273 - Hi, I'm looking for...\\
274 - Hyde!\\
275 - Hey, baby!\\
276 - Hey, Sam.\\
277 - Who the hell is that?\\
278 - This is Sam. She's a...\\
279 - Exotic dancer I met in Vegas.\\
280 - I'm sorry,
what are you doing here?\\
281 - You don't remember?
We got married.\\
282 - - Oh, my God!
- What?\\
283 - One more thing, Eric.
Steven married a stripper!\\
284 - You know, being up here makes
me think of our poor friend Billy.\\
285 - His name was Charlie,
you cantaloupe.\\
286 - Kelso, you've fallen off
this thing, like, 10 times.\\
287 - It's so scary to think you could have, you
know, like, met the same fate as Charlie.\\
288 - Yeah. It's like we go through our life,
like, thinking we're invincible, right,\\
289 - but the truth is,
we're totally vincible.\\
290 - Screw that!
I'm invincible!
\subsection {Episode 02: Somebody to Love (2)}
1 - Oh, my God, what did I do?\\
2 - You married
a Las Vegas stripper.\\
3 - Congratulations.\\
4 - With Eric gone,
you're the town dumb ass.\\
5 - Steven, how could you get
married and not remember?\\
6 - It's not like forgetting
where you left your keys,\\
7 - or where you
parked your car, or...\\
8 - Your 10th anniversary.\\
9 - I don't know what happened.\\
10 - I mean, Samantha and I
hung out for three weeks,\\
11 - and then one night
we got really drunk,\\
12 - and I remember waking up
with a killer hangover\\
13 - thinking I better get out of Vegas
before I do something stupid.\\
14 - So close!\\
15 - Here are some
pictures of our wedding.\\
16 - We found this beautiful little
chapel called Weddings and Waffles.\\
17 - Wow, that must have
been some wedding.\\
18 - It's not too often that you see
the bride jump out of her own cake.\\
19 - Oh, man, it's
starting to come back to me.\\
20 - I remember seeing
a cross and an altar.\\
21 - But I thought I was having
that Exorcist dream again.\\
22 - Where's the stripper?\\
23 - There she is! There's
a stripper in the kitchen!\\
24 - Am I yelling? I can't help it!\\
25 - Oh, Hyde, you married a
stripper! I love you so much, man!\\
26 - You must be Kelso.
I'm Samantha Hyde.\\
27 - Oh, my God, you took my name?\\
28 - Oh, Steven, you look like
you're about to throw up.\\
29 - Here,
use Eric's "whoopsie" basin.\\
30 - Aim for the Snoopy.\\
31 - I gotta get out of here. I'm
gonna go to the record store.\\
32 - Whoa, Hyde, you're,
like, freaking out, man.\\
33 - You married a stripper!
You're living every guy's dream!\\
34 - Well, not my dream,
my dream's always the same.\\
35 - A monkey gives me the finger\\
36 - and flaps his lips at me\\
37 - and takes off with my clothes.\\
38 - Trust me, you don't
wanna live that dream.\\
39 - What's the store doing closed
in the middle of the day?\\
40 - Maybe it's Rosh Hashanah.\\
41 - Hey, dudes, pull up a pillow.\\
42 - Leo, what the hell did you do
with my record store?\\
43 - Record store?\\
44 - You know,
now that you mention it,\\
45 - this place would make
an awesome record store.\\
46 - Hanging out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - I left you in charge\\
56 - and you turned my store into a
hippie den for your stoner friends?\\
57 - That's not true, man. I don't
know any of these people.\\
58 - Leo, I am not in
the mood for this today.\\
59 - Just get these people out of
here, all right? I'll be in my office.\\
60 - Leo,
there's an orgy in my office!\\
61 - I can't tell the boys from
the girls, it's hair everywhere!\\
62 - Man. This is no way
to spend Rosh Hashanah.\\
63 - I can't believe Hyde.\\
64 - I mean, he completely broke Jackie's heart.
Who just goes and marries a stripper?\\
65 - What are you, dense?\\
66 - Anybody who can, that's who.\\
67 - Okay, get dressed. We're going out.
But it doesn't really matter what you wear,\\
68 - because everyone's
gonna be looking at me.\\
69 - But don't wear that.\\
70 - Whoa, Jackie. After everything
you've been through with Hyde,\\
71 - you come here and insult me?\\
72 - You're all better!\\
73 - Well, I am not
gonna sit around moping.\\
74 - I'm gonna do what every woman
does when they hit rock bottom.\\
75 - You're going to
have sex with me?\\
76 - No.\\
77 - I'm going to go out and meet some
boys, and crush their hearts one by one.\\
78 - You know, Donna, Eric is in Africa.
You must be close to hitting rock bottom.\\
79 - Not really.\\
80 - How long does a boy have to wait before
one of you floozies hits rock bottom?\\
81 - Oh, Samantha. You're
painting your toes in the kitchen.\\
82 - That's funny because I was just
making meatloaf in the bathroom.\\
83 - Sorry. Hyde told me how
much he likes painted toes.\\
84 - He told me some
other things he liked,\\
85 - but I said, "Hey, I'm a
stripper, not a contortionist."\\
86 - Well, isn't that just more
than a mother wants to hear.\\
87 - Okay, so, I'm curious.\\
88 - What is your act like?
Do you sing?\\
89 - No, I just dance.\\
90 - Oh. Well, when I was younger,
I took tap. Do you do tap?\\
91 - No. But funny you should
mention it, I strip to Taps.\\
92 - You mean the song they play
when an army man dies?\\
93 - Yeah. It's my tribute
to our armed forces.\\
94 - I wave the American flag,
and then, for the big finish,\\
95 - I give a salute,
and then I smack my fanny.\\
96 - Sorry, I...\\
97 - No, I'm sorry. This thing
has a mind of its own.\\
98 - Red, I'm not sure how I feel about
having a stripper stay in our home.\\
99 - It's... What's the word?
An abomination!\\
100 - I don't think Steven even knew what
he was doing when he married her.\\
101 - It sounds like he was as schnockered
as you were on St. Patrick's Day.\\
102 - Okay, well, that green punch
sneaks right up on you.\\
103 - I think Steven has
made a huge mistake.\\
104 - But what are we gonna do?
Kick Sam out?\\
105 - Oh, we will do no such thing.\\
106 - You will.\\
107 - Oh, fine. But
the next time you hit a deer,\\
108 - you're the one putting it out
of its misery with a tire iron.\\
109 - Well, well, another day in the
life of a Point Place police officer.\\
110 - I just confiscated a whole box of lighters,
paraphernalia and illegal substances.\\
111 - Nice work, Officer.\\
112 - Ah, we're hooked
up for two months.\\
113 - So, what do we do now?\\
114 - Man, I think I'm gonna have to fire
Leo. He almost put me out of business.\\
115 - I just wish there was
a good way to do it.\\
116 - This is definitely gooder.\\
117 - "Gooder?"\\
118 - Yeah, that's a word.\\
119 - Leo, I left you in charge of the
store and you let me down, man.\\
120 - So, I'm sorry to have to say...\\
121 - You're fired, man!\\
122 - I think the word you're
looking for is "fried," man.\\
123 - And I am.\\
124 - No,
no, man, I mean you're fired!\\
125 - That's even funnier, man.\\
126 - And I totally deserve it.\\
127 - Yeah,
and you're under arrest, too.\\
128 - What?\\
129 - No, I'm just kidding. These
handcuffs don't even work. Look.\\
130 - Wait, these are
the ones that do work.\\
131 - Hey, I saw this "Help Wanted"
sign outside. Are you still looking?\\
132 - Uh...\\
133 - Leo, were you
trying to hire somebody?\\
134 - No. Yesterday, I was having a
hard time opening up a jar of pickles,\\
135 - so I put
the "Help Wanted" sign up.\\
136 - You're too late, man,
I found something else to eat.\\
137 - Why do they make the
lid so tight? It's just pickles!\\
138 - So you're not hiring?\\
139 - That's a bummer. 'Cause I gotta say,
if this is your idea of a staff meeting,\\
140 - I'd work my butt off!\\
141 - What the hell, man, I'm
in a giving mood right now.\\
142 - You can have the job and do
all the work that Leo wasn't doing.\\
143 - And, Leo, I can't fire you,
man. You're too awesome.\\
144 - New guy, you're hired. Leo,
you're not fired. Jobs for everyone!\\
145 - Well, that was hard,
but it had to be done.\\
146 - Whoa, Jackie,
that is quite an outfit.\\
147 - Does it come with a pimp?\\
148 - Donna,
this is my man-catcher dress.\\
149 - It's scientifically designed
to make men want me\\
150 - while at the same time knowing
they could never really have me.\\
151 - Oh, everyone loves a tease.\\
152 - Oh, he's cute and smiling.\\
153 - I'm gonna go make
him wish he was dead.\\
154 - Can I ask you a question?\\
155 - Yes, I'm available.\\
156 - But not to you! Ha! Burn!\\
157 - Oh, my God, that was so much
fun. I wanna do another one.\\
158 - Actually, I just wanted to know
your hot blond friend's name.\\
159 - Oh, I don't have
a hot blond friend.\\
160 - I'm just here
with Fez and Donna.\\
161 - - Donna? Thanks.
- Wait, wait. What? You like Donna?\\
162 - She reads books for fun!\\
163 - Hi, I'm Mark.\\
164 - Wow, you have one of the
prettiest smiles I've ever seen.\\
165 - Oh, thank you.\\
166 - Well, the secret
is to brush with baking soda.\\
167 - Actually, I was talking to Donna.
Wow, you are just gorgeous.\\
168 - - Really?
- Yeah.\\
169 - You know, Donna means "lady" in
Italian and belladonna means "fine lady"\\
170 - and you... You are
definitely one fine lady.\\
171 - What's Italian for "keep going"?\\
172 - Wanna play a little pool?\\
173 - Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I have a boyfriend.\\
174 - He's in Africa.\\
175 - Well, he is just missing out
on how beautiful you look.\\
176 - Italian.\\
177 - Can you believe that?\\
178 - Ah, don't worry.
You still got me.\\
179 - Hi, I'm Kim. Dance with me.\\
180 - So long, lame-o!\\
181 - Hey, Samantha, you should have
seen your dopey husband today.\\
182 - He was supposed to fire Leo,\\
183 - but then he wussed out
and hired a new guy, too.\\
184 - It's like the time I went
to break up with this chick,\\
185 - and I ended up doing it
with her and her mom.\\
186 - I understand why you
couldn't fire anyone.\\
187 - On the outside you're rough
and cynical, but underneath it all,\\
188 - you're just a sweet, curly-haired
boy who likes to be tickled.\\
189 - Really?\\
190 - Kelso, if you try to
tickle me, I swear to God,\\
191 - I'll rip off your arm and tickle the
bloody hole with your own hand.\\
192 - You'll figure out what to do,
honey, you have great instincts.\\
193 - You have a great butt, too,
but that's a whole other thing.\\
194 - She is awesome.\\
195 - Hey, Sam, let me ask you a
question about being a stripper.\\
196 - Can I see your boobs?\\
197 - Oh, Samantha. You're here.\\
198 - Did Red talk to you,
by any chance?\\
199 - Mr. Forman? No. Why?\\
200 - Oh. Well, um...\\
201 - What's that?
Be right there, Eric!\\
202 - Then my psychiatrist said
the reason I always want sex\\
203 - is because I never got
approval from my parents,\\
204 - so I'm trying to
find it somewhere else.\\
205 - Do you think he's right?\\
206 - Dear God, I hope so.\\
207 - Who does that guy think he is,
rejecting me like that?\\
208 - I am the hottest girl here.
Right, Fez?\\
209 - Hey, you! Mark, is it? Yeah.\\
210 - I don't know where you're from,\\
211 - but I'll have you know,
I am the catch of Point Place.\\
212 - That's true. That's how
she signed my yearbook.\\
213 - Hey, come back here!
Nobody ignores Jerky Backhart!\\
214 - I am adorable, I am engaging,
and I'm damn likeable!\\
215 - And if you're too stupid to see
that, then I feel sorry for you.\\
216 - 'Cause if anyone should be
the center of attention here,\\
217 - it's me.\\
218 - Jackie!\\
219 - What the hell's a "boobs out"?\\
220 - Okay, your turn.\\
221 - Ah, Samantha, there you are.
Good.\\
222 - Hi, Mr.
Forman. I was just unpacking.\\
223 - Aren't these cute?\\
224 - I mean,
you can't tell like this.\\
225 - You have to
picture them like this.\\
226 - Plus they hold dollar bills in
place better than anything I own.\\
227 - I'm going upstairs
to find you a wallet!\\
228 - Hey, Randy, come here.
I gotta talk to you.\\
229 - Yeah, sure, but check this out
first. See these guys over there?\\
230 - They think Leo is
an Allman Brother.\\
231 - - Why would they think that?
- I told them!\\
232 - Whoa, Leo is an Allman Brother?\\
233 - No, man. We were overstocked
with Allman Brothers albums.\\
234 - So I figured meeting
one of the guys from the band\\
235 - would put people
in a buying mood.\\
236 - And it totally worked!\\
237 - And Leo's up for this?\\
238 - Oh, he has no
idea what's going on.\\
239 - I mean, at all.
He's really out of it.\\
240 - You know, now that you mention it, if
we give him a hat and some sunglasses,\\
241 - we could probably use him
to move some ZZ Top.\\
242 - Yeah. Your friend here might be
pretty enough to pass off as Cher.\\
243 - Yeah.\\
244 - That's not a bad idea,
Andy Gibb.\\
245 - So what did you want
to talk to me about?\\
246 - Oh.\\
247 - Well, I guess I just
wanted to congratulate you\\
248 - on your new job here
at the record store.\\
249 - I name you senior vice
president in charge of scams.\\
250 - All right, man!\\
251 - Man, I can't fire Leo.
He's like a father to me.\\
252 - Well, like a friend.\\
253 - Well, he's like a guy
who's always got a lighter.\\
254 - Whoa. So if you're not gonna fire
Randy, and you're not gonna fire Leo,\\
255 - I got a question.\\
256 - Can I see your wife's boobs?\\
257 - Hey, guys, guess what?\\
258 - One of the Allman
Brothers is here.\\
259 - This new guy Randy is awesome.
Today he was looking over the records,\\
260 - and he figured out it would
be easier to find things\\
261 - if we just alphabetized them.\\
262 - Hey, do you know
what you were doing just now?\\
263 - No, what?\\
264 - Telling your wife about
your day. Pretty cool, huh?\\
265 - Didn't suck.\\
266 - Oh, good. You're both here.\\
267 - We want to talk to you
about your marriage.\\
268 - Steven, I've come to
think of you as a son,\\
269 - and so I want to give you
some honest, heartfelt advice.\\
270 - Get your head out of your ass.\\
271 - You two barely know each other.\\
272 - Not to mention
the fact that I saw a TV movie\\
273 - where someone like you moved
in and killed the whole family.\\
274 - Steven, honey, if this isn't what
you want, you should say so now.\\
275 - Yeah, you should.\\
276 - Hyde, if you don't want me here, I'll
pack up my things and leave tonight.\\
277 - No, man, it's cool.\\
278 - Okay, then.\\
279 - Oh, she's staying.\\
280 - Well, I guess I'll go set an extra
place at the table for stripper...\\
281 - Supper!\\
282 - You're never gonna believe
this. I drove here this way.\\
283 - Jackie, will you please come out?
I don't even think anyone saw you.\\
284 - Oh, my God!\\
285 - I'm sorry about my friend,
she's a little prudish.\\
286 - And not as free with her body
as I hope you will be.\\
287 - Ready to go, baby?\\
288 - Hey, buddy, the only guy
she is leaving with is me.\\
289 - Unless you just wanna do it
in the bathroom,\\
290 - then we can leave separately.\\
291 - Fez, there's
something I need to tell you.\\
292 - Mark and I are married.\\
293 - What?\\
294 - Yeah, we come here every weekend,
watch each other hit on strangers.\\
295 - It makes for some ultra hot
action when we get back home.\\
296 - Wait, yeah, Eric and I tried that
once. I got three phone numbers\\
297 - and he got the high score
on Space Invaders.\\
298 - Wait, you do this every weekend? You
shower some poor loser with affection\\
299 - and then toss him
aside when you're done?\\
300 - Yeah.\\
301 - See you next weekend.\\
302 - Well, I gotta say,
Sam is pretty cool.\\
303 - Yeah?\\
304 - Yeah. Yesterday
for no reason at all,\\
305 - she grabbed a beer out of the
fridge and just, like, gave it to me.\\
306 - I mean, what's that all about?\\
307 - Maybe that's what husbands
and wives do for each other?\\
308 - Craziest damn thing I ever saw.\\
309 - Uh, Steven, I just wanna let
you know that we're through.\\
310 - If you're gonna go off and marry
someone you don't even know,\\
311 - then we can't be
together anymore.\\
312 - Okay. Well, I guess you
always have Kelso to fall back on.\\
313 - Or Fez.\\
314 - Hey, what? Did I hear my name?\\
315 - Are Jackie and I going to do it? Can
somebody tell me what's going on?\\
316 - Steven, I have been
so stupid for so long.\\
317 - I tried to force Michael to marry
me, I tried to force you to marry me.\\
318 - And last night, I threw myself at some
unavailable creep I didn't even like.\\
319 - Well, now you've hit a new low.\\
320 - Throwing yourself at some guy
on Rosh Hashanah.\\
321 - So you know what? I am done
making an ass of myself for you.\\
322 - Or any other guys.\\
323 - In fact, I'm done
with guys completely.\\
324 - Hear that, Hyde?\\
325 - We screwed her up so bad
she's switching to chicks!\\
326 - How awesome are we!\\
327 - So I was thinking
about you all week,\\
328 - and how cute and flustered
you looked when I kissed you.\\
329 - I really liked that.\\
330 - Yes, me, too.\\
331 - You know what, this is
too creepy. Even for me.\\
332 - Enjoy your sick lives together.\\
333 - No, sorry about that, I don't
even know what that was about.\\
334 - Where were we?
\subsection {Episode 03: You're My Best Friend}
1 - I still can't believe
our little Hyde went off\\
2 - and married
a Las Vegas stripper.\\
3 - Yeah. Now we have
to get him a present.\\
4 - What says, "Congratulations on
your wedding, I want to nail your wife"?\\
5 - Oh, we should get him one
of those big electric knives!\\
6 - Those suckers will cut
right through your hand.\\
7 - Can I help you?\\
8 - Leo, it's me, Randy. I got hired
last week? We drove in together?\\
9 - Oh, yeah, Frankie!\\
10 - Randy!\\
11 - No, it's Leo.\\
12 - Hey, Sam, this is Randy.\\
13 - Randy, this is my wife Samantha.\\
14 - Wife? I didn't
know you were married.\\
15 - Yep, they said it wouldn't last,\\
16 - but we're going on six days now.\\
17 - Hey, we've got to throw you
a killer bachelor party!\\
18 - No, absolutely not.\\
19 - If I want to spend money on a
stripper, I'll take Samantha shopping.\\
20 - Hey, I hope you
guys are comfortable\\
21 - getting turned on in
front of each other.\\
22 - Yeah, okay.
I don't mind, I guess.\\
23 - Great! 'Cause we are
throwing Hyde a bachelor party!\\
24 - Bachelor party?
That is awesome!\\
25 - Okay, the first guy that throws
up has to pay for everything!\\
26 - No, wait, that's always me.\\
27 - Uh, okay, the second guy...
Ah, that's me, too.\\
28 - Awesome! I'm paying!\\
29 - All right,
Fez, you, find a place,\\
30 - Kelso you buy the beer, and Leo,\\
31 - you're in charge
of the adult entertainment.\\
32 - Okay, man. But I haven't stripped
since I was at Chippendales.\\
33 - You were not at Chippendales.\\
34 - Oh, right.
I stripped in Bloomingdale's.\\
35 - I used to be
really kinda out of it.\\
36 - Hanging out\\
37 - Down the street\\
38 - The same old thing\\
39 - We did last week\\
40 - Not a thing to do\\
41 - But talk to you\\
42 - We're all all right\\
43 - We're all all right\\
44 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
45 - Ah.\\
46 - Bad news, Kelso, we can't have
the bachelor party at our place.\\
47 - Our landlord said he'll evict us\\
48 - if we have any
more crazy parties.\\
49 - How was I supposed to know
that racoon had rabies?\\
50 - Why don't we
have the party here?\\
51 - Hey, that's not a bad idea.\\
52 - I just have one question.
Who the hell are you?\\
53 - I'm Randy, I work at
Hyde's record store.\\
54 - Go to college part-time.
Manage bands.\\
55 - If you name a city,
I can tell you the time zone.\\
56 - Boise.
Mountain.\\
57 - Impressive.\\
58 - Okay, Kelso, you'll be in charge\\
59 - of getting rid of the Forman's.\\
60 - That'll be easy.\\
61 - Without starting a fire.\\
62 - Why don't you just handcuff me
and throw me in a well, Donna!\\
63 - Uh, okay,
Mrs. Forman is a woman,\\
64 - which means that she
used to be a chick.\\
65 - So therefore, I will just
play on her insecurities.\\
66 - Kelso, I really doubt
you can pull that off.\\
67 - Sure, I can, Mr. You're-Never-Gonna-Lose-
Those-Love-Handles.\\
68 - I stand corrected.\\
69 - Okay, now, the best thing
about a bachelor party\\
70 - is tricking the guy into thinking
something bad is gonna happen\\
71 - and then taking
him someplace great!\\
72 - I thought the best thing was
making women who normally hate you\\
73 - pretend to like you
because you have a dollar.\\
74 - What a wonderful tradition.\\
75 - So what we need is
a crazy way to get\\
76 - Hyde here without
him expecting anything.\\
77 - Wait a minute, I'm a cop!\\
78 - Yeah! Me and Fez
will be in the El Camino\\
79 - with Hyde, you pull
us over, arrest us\\
80 - and bring us to
the party in a police car!\\
81 - No! I left my gun
at the playground!\\
82 - Hey, Donna!
Sorry I'm late.\\
83 - I didn't want to
come over till all\\
84 - my other options for
tonight fell through.\\
85 - Good to see you, too, Jackie.\\
86 - I just figured since the guys
are throwing a party for Hyde\\
87 - that we should have
our own girls' night.\\
88 - Well, as long as it
isn't a pity party.\\
89 - Because I am
completely over Steven.\\
90 - God, I can't wait
till we can sit around\\
91 - and trash that skanky
stripper he married.\\
92 - Donna, why does all
the food in the kitchen\\
93 - have a "Property of
Bob" sticker on it?\\
94 - Oh, hi, Jackie!\\
95 - I can't believe you
invited the whore!\\
96 - Who are you calling a whore?\\
97 - Well, I only see one whore here.\\
98 - Girls' night. Yeah!\\
99 - Hi there, Miss Kitty!\\
100 - Oh, hi, boys!\\
101 - Hey. So,
Saturday night,\\
102 - you and that husband of
yours got any big plans?\\
103 - Well we sure do.\\
104 - First he's taking
me on The Love Boat\\
105 - and then he is taking
me to Fantasy Island.\\
106 - Ze plane, ze plane!\\
107 - I love that guy,
he is so little.\\
108 - So you're staying home again.
Sounds to me like your marriage is dead.\\
109 - What? Our marriage is fine.\\
110 - Oh, please!\\
111 - Red's got you
working harder than\\
112 - a hot dog salesman at
a fat guy convention.\\
113 - You know, when was
the last time that Red\\
114 - took you out for
a night on the town?\\
115 - Well,\\
116 - a couple of weeks ago
he took me to the movies\\
117 - and then when it was over he
came back and he picked me up.\\
118 - Mrs. Forman, Red needs
to take you out tonight.\\
119 - On a real date,
that lasts at least, what,\\
120 - three, three-and-a-half hours?\\
121 - You know what?
You're right.\\
122 - Kitty! What's for supper?\\
123 - Well, that's up to
the chef at Frenchies.\\
124 - We're going out
tonight and I'm getting\\
125 - the most expensive
thing on the menu.\\
126 - The six-dollar steak?\\
127 - Kitty, we're in a recession!\\
128 - Boy, Red, that woman is testy.\\
129 - Stay out of it, chubby.\\
130 - I'm retaining water!\\
131 - Fez, I'm sick of
driving you around\\
132 - just because your belly
has got the rumblies!\\
133 - Hey,
there is Kelso's cop car.\\
134 - Let the party begin.\\
135 - What?\\
136 - Step on it, grandma!\\
137 - What are you doing, man?
Get off my foot!\\
138 - This is unbelievable!\\
139 - Ah, man, just what we needed,
getting pulled over by a cop.\\
140 - Yeah, this is gonna
ruin the whole evening.\\
141 - License and registration.\\
142 - Surprise, Hyde!
Who the hell is that?\\
143 - Get out of the car, sir.\\
144 - Uh, Fez.\\
145 - I know you said all us
white people look the same,\\
146 - but that is not Kelso.\\
147 - Oh, I know what is
going on here.\\
148 - If Kelso pulls us over,
then Hyde will be suspicious.\\
149 - So he sent another cop to
make the joke more realistic.\\
150 - Oh, Kelso, you beautiful genius.\\
151 - Nice job, Fez,
you just got me a ticket.\\
152 - Ah, starting off slow with
a ticket, huh? Nice touch!\\
153 - I'll take that.\\
154 - Fez, what are you doing?\\
155 - Sir, give me back
that ticket before you...\\
156 - Before what?
It starts to snow?\\
157 - Okay, that's it!\\
158 - What are you gonna do, piggie?
Throw us in jail?\\
159 - He threw us in jail.\\
160 - Fez, I don't know why you are
smiling, but I promise you won't be\\
161 - when I sell your ass
for a pack of cigarettes!\\
162 - First of all, this ass is
worth at least a carton.\\
163 - And second of all, welcome
to your bachelor party!\\
164 - A bachelor party has beers
and topless ladies.\\
165 - This place has
iron bars and a bum\\
166 - wearing no pants
sitting on my jacket.\\
167 - That is not a cushion!\\
168 - Fez, I don't think this is
part of the bachelor party.\\
169 - They fingerprinted us!\\
170 - Well I don't know.
Maybe that's how the strippers\\
171 - know what to charge.\\
172 - You know,
at the end of the night,\\
173 - they count the fingerprints on their
boobies and they know who owes what.\\
174 - Dude!
You are scarily optimistic!\\
175 - Something clearly got messed up!\\
176 - Trust me, this is all
part of Kelso's plan.\\
177 - I guarantee you he is on
his way over here right now.\\
178 - You know, the thing
about being a cop is,\\
179 - we may look like normal people,\\
180 - I mean, I don't, obviously,\\
181 - but we have to go
through rigorous training\\
182 - to be able to withstand any kind of
mental, physical, or emotional pain.\\
183 - Ah, brain freeze!\\
184 - Make it stop!
Make it stop!\\
185 - Donna, how could you invite
the stripper here?\\
186 - This is supposed to be girls'
night, not girls, girls, girls night.\\
187 - Samantha,
you'll have to excuse Jackie.\\
188 - She has a speech impediment
that makes everything sound bitchy.\\
189 - It's okay, Donna.\\
190 - This isn't the first time I've had
to deal with an angry ex-girlfriend.\\
191 - Or wife. Or mother. One time
it was some guy's boyfriend.\\
192 - That was just weird.\\
193 - So, um, tell me,
what are you gonna do\\
194 - with all your
stripper money, huh?\\
195 - Buy back your self esteem?\\
196 - Actually, I bought a Trans-Am.\\
197 - Ooh, a slut-car!\\
198 - Okay, stop! Jackie,\\
199 - you and Samantha are gonna
have to learn to how to get along.\\
200 - Mostly because I
don't like being\\
201 - the cream filling in
your Oreo of bitchiness.\\
202 - Oh, so what, all of a sudden your
happiness is more important than mine?\\
203 - You are so selfish!\\
204 - No, it's just that unlike you,
I don't think Samantha\\
205 - is the worst piece of trash
to ever walk the earth.\\
206 - You traitor!\\
207 - Jackie! Come on!\\
208 - So, what color is your Trans-Am?\\
209 - Powder blue.
That's freakin' awesome!\\
210 - See now, wasn't it great
to get out for a change?\\
211 - We had a good meal,
nice conversation\\
212 - and look,
we stayed out past 9:00!\\
213 - It's like New Year's Eve!\\
214 - How about that dopey waiter
that flambeed his tie?\\
215 - Yeah, those French bastards
should stick to what they're good at.\\
216 - Baking bread and losing wars!\\
217 - Surprise!
Surprise!\\
218 - What the hell?\\
219 - Happy bachelor party, Steven!\\
220 - Who is this?\\
221 - That's my wife!\\
222 - Well, she can watch,
but that's extra.\\
223 - I can't believe you guys
got me thrown in jail.\\
224 - It feels so fake,
like I didn't earn it.\\
225 - Guys, I'm starting to
think this might not\\
226 - be part of the whole
bachelor party plan.\\
227 - Unless she is a stripper.\\
228 - You know what?
She might be.\\
229 - Why don't you
tell her to shake it?\\
230 - You know, it's so nice to
finally have someone on my side!\\
231 - Hey, baby, why don't you
rip off that phony uniform\\
232 - and start shaking
your moneymaker?\\
233 - Are you talking to me?\\
234 - That's right, momma!\\
235 - First of all,
I'm not your momma.\\
236 - And if you ever talk
to me like that again,\\
237 - I will pull your skinny ass
through these bars\\
238 - and find 50 new ways
to use my nightstick!\\
239 - I don't know if
she's a stripper,\\
240 - but she sure knows
how to turn a boy on.\\
241 - Kelso! Where the
hell have you been?\\
242 - There was an emergency
at the ice cream stand.\\
243 - They hired a new girl
and she's super cute.\\
244 - Yeah, guys, so I'm loving
spending my bachelor party in jail.\\
245 - What are you guys gonna do
for my birthday?\\
246 - Set me on fire,
push me off a cliff?\\
247 - I'll take care of this.\\
248 - Ah, listen, Sergeant, ah, I think
there was, like, a big misunderstanding.\\
249 - See, I was supposed to arrest
these guys on trumped-up charges\\
250 - and then take 'em to a
bachelor party in the police car\\
251 - and then we were gonna watch
some strippers dance and get drunk.\\
252 - But I was totally gonna be
back by the end of my shift.\\
253 - Isn't that hilarious?\\
254 - That lady has no sense of humor.\\
255 - I want all of you people
out of my house, now!\\
256 - Hey, we're not going anywhere
until we get our money.\\
257 - I got an unemployed
husband to feed.\\
258 - Leo, pay these women.\\
259 - I don't have any money, man.\\
260 - All I have is a ticket
for the 1964 World's Fair.\\
261 - One more year, I can't wait!\\
262 - Well, I'm all out of money since\\
263 - big spender, here,
had to get the salad bar.\\
264 - Well, for heaven's sake, Red.\\
265 - I'll just write
the girls a check\\
266 - and the boys can
pay us back later.\\
267 - Fine. It's $100.\\
268 - Well, clearly I am in
the wrong profession.\\
269 - Does Jackie do this a lot?\\
270 - Just run off and lock herself in
her room when she gets mad at you?\\
271 - Huh. Not always.\\
272 - Sometimes she just tells
people I'm four months pregnant.\\
273 - How can you be friends with her?\\
274 - Well... See the thing
about Jackie, is...\\
275 - See, it's like...\\
276 - Um...\\
277 - Okay, look, here's the thing.\\
278 - Jackie and I have been
through a lot together.\\
279 - And, well, she's my best friend.\\
280 - Did you mean that Donna?
Am I really your best friend?\\
281 - Yeah, of course!\\
282 - Hah! Stuff that up your
G-string and smoke it.\\
283 - Well, you might have
stolen my boyfriend,\\
284 - but you're not
gonna steal Donna.\\
285 - So get out, stripper.\\
286 - You get out!\\
287 - Well, you get out times two!\\
288 - You get out times infinity!\\
289 - You get out times 10.\\
290 - Okay, you both made
some really good points.\\
291 - But now I think
we should sit down\\
292 - and talk like
intelligent adults.\\
293 - My Trans-Am is gonna be
orange with wings\\
294 - and wheels made of fire. And
when you slam on the brakes,\\
295 - a parachute shoots
out of the back with\\
296 - my picture on it and
I'm flippin' you off!\\
297 - Donna, this party was such a
good idea. You know what I love?\\
298 - Watching this airhead stripper\\
299 - wasting away her last
remaining brain cells.\\
300 - You know what I love?
Your old boyfriend!\\
301 - Wait, I just realized
something. I think I hate you!\\
302 - That's so lucky,
because I hate you, too!\\
303 - But, I'm gonna put up with you
for Donna's sake.\\
304 - 'Cause she doesn't have
very many friends!\\
305 - That's not true, Jackie.
I have a ton of friends.\\
306 - There's...\\
307 - Oh, there's that
one girl who... No!\\
308 - Listen, Hyde, I'm sorry
about this mess, man.\\
309 - But you can't get
married and not expect\\
310 - your buds to throw you a party.\\
311 - I mean, your life is over,
we gotta celebrate!\\
312 - Yeah. Where were you guys
gonna take me, anyway?\\
313 - The Forman's.\\
314 - Huh. Where I live.\\
315 - Yeah, I can see why you needed
an elaborate plan to get me there.\\
316 - All right, since Officer Kelso
is responsible for this,\\
317 - the rest of you are free to go.\\
318 - It's not your fault your
friend is a complete moron.\\
319 - Well, that's true. You
can't choose your friends.\\
320 - Don't worry, Kelso, we're your
buddies, we're not gonna leave you.\\
321 - Well, I hope he gets out soon.\\
322 - We only have those strippers
for another half hour!\\
323 - I'll see you in hell!\\
324 - Let the fiesta of flesh begin!\\
325 - I know!\\
326 - How dare you invite
strippers into my home.\\
327 - The whole place smells
like strawberries and baby oil.\\
328 - You idiots tricked me and Kitty\\
329 - into going out and
having a good time.\\
330 - Do you know how
furious that makes me?\\
331 - Sir, if I could just explain.\\
332 - Who the hell are you?\\
333 - I'm Randy and I just
wanted to say I'm sorry.\\
334 - We tried to do
something nice for\\
335 - our friend and things
got really out of hand,\\
336 - but I apologize for any disrespect
that we may have shown you.\\
337 - Well, Randy, I'm impressed\\
338 - that something so articulate
could come out of such a dumb ass!\\
339 - And, you!
You owe me $100!\\
340 - Fine. But you better put on
one hell of a show.\\
341 - Why is it all in $1 bills?\\
342 - Because that's how
you pay strippers.\\
343 - I was in the war,
for God's sake!\\
344 - You guys are not gonna
believe this. I was fired!\\
345 - I'm off the force.\\
346 - Man, if only I had said
I didn't want a bachelor party\\
347 - maybe none of this
would have happened.\\
348 - Oh, well.\\
349 - Oh, it was humiliating.\\
350 - They took my badge
and they took my gun\\
351 - and then when I went to
say goodbye to the police dog,\\
352 - I accidentally shot him.\\
353 - There is only one thing that
would cheer me up tonight.\\
354 - A strip club?\\
355 - You freaky little mind reader!\\
356 - Let's go, I'll drive.
We'll take my cop car.\\
357 - Wait, you didn't
have to turn that in?\\
358 - They didn't even ask!\\
359 - All right guys,
sit back and enjoy the show.\\
360 - Uh, Leo,
when does the show start?\\
361 - This is the show, man.\\
362 - Where's the stripper?\\
363 - What do we need a stripper
for? We got a giant cake!
\subsection {Episode 04: Misfire}
1 - So, thank you for celebrating
our 25th anniversary with us.\\
2 - You know, nothing makes
me appreciate my beautiful wife\\
3 - more than a room full of people\\
4 - that I don't
like as much as her.\\
5 - Okay, my turn.\\
6 - Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
your long and happy marriage\\
7 - got me thinking about my future.\\
8 - And when I think about my future\\
9 - there is always
someone special in it.\\
10 - I mean, besides me.\\
11 - So, in front of all
the people that I love,\\
12 - Jacqueline Burkhart,
will you marry me?\\
13 - Hanging out\\
14 - Down the street\\
15 - The same old thing\\
16 - We did last week\\
17 - Not a thing to do\\
18 - But talk to you\\
19 - We're all all right\\
20 - We're all all right\\
21 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
22 - Look at this, Red,
what is more beautiful\\
23 - than a sweaty broad
doing your laundry?\\
24 - How about
a smart-mouth foreigner\\
25 - gasping for air as I hold
his head in the toilet?\\
26 - Oh, here, let me take that
for you, sweetie!\\
27 - Oh! Oh, I am
so light-headed!\\
28 - I don't think I can
clean out the lint trap.\\
29 - Well, it could cause a fire.\\
30 - Wow, Mrs. Forman.\\
31 - You and Mr. Forman seem
happier than I've ever seen you\\
32 - in the two times
I've ever seen you.\\
33 - Well, that's because it's our
25th anniversary in two days.\\
34 - Oh, 25 years? Man if you guys
were dogs, that would be like...\\
35 - Twenty-five dog years.\\
36 - Anyway. I'm throwing a
surprise party, but don't tell Red.\\
37 - Ever since Pearl Harbor,
he has hated surprises.\\
38 - Hey, I won another free Pepsi!\\
39 - You always win! I never win!
I wish you were dead!\\
40 - Oh. That was a dark place.\\
41 - Okay, I'm working on
a new bit for my act.\\
42 - What is sexier?
This genie costume,\\
43 - or my naughty stewardess outfit?\\
44 - Sam, what did I
tell you about parading\\
45 - around half-naked in
front of my friends?\\
46 - If you're gonna do it,
you gotta charge 'em.\\
47 - Man. It's like everyone is so
happy lately. Except for me.\\
48 - I mean, the Forman's
have their anniversary party,\\
49 - Hyde is married
to a half-naked girl.\\
50 - What do I got? Nothing! Except
for this little plastic dinosaur.\\
51 - You know, when
I'm down, I try to think\\
52 - about the happiest
times of my life.\\
53 - Like when Hyde's wife came
out here in that genie outfit.\\
54 - The happiest time of my life
was when I was with Jackie.\\
55 - What are you talking about?\\
56 - She was always
yelling at you, hitting you,\\
57 - telling you what
a moron you are.\\
58 - You might as well
have been dating me.\\
59 - Oh, man, I was
really in love with her.\\
60 - And then I blew it.
And then she blew it.\\
61 - And then I blew it again.\\
62 - I don't know who blew it last,
but I'm definitely winning!\\
63 - It sounds like you guys had
a real on-again, off-again,\\
64 - on-again, off-again,
on-again, off-again relationship.\\
65 - Wait, that's it!
That's why I'm not happy!\\
66 - Because the girl
I should be with is\\
67 - right in front of me
and I'm not with her!\\
68 - I should be with Jackie!
No, I should marry Jackie!\\
69 - What? I love weddings.\\
70 - Dad, it's 4:00 in the morning.
What are you doing up?\\
71 - Spending a little
time with the Colonel.\\
72 - So why are you up?\\
73 - Eric's calling from Africa.\\
74 - You know, I never realized
how nerdy he was\\
75 - until I started spending
three bucks a minute\\
76 - filling him in on
Battlestar Galactica.\\
77 - Well, I'll give you
your privacy.\\
78 - I like eating chicken better in
bed, anyway. Everything is a napkin.\\
79 - Sweetheart!
What?\\
80 - Did you stay
down here all night?\\
81 - Oh yeah. I guess so. Eric
never called, I hope he is okay.\\
82 - Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.
Either that, or he's dead.\\
83 - It can only be one of the two.\\
84 - And get this,
I waited up for Eric\\
85 - to call me last night,
and he never did.\\
86 - So I asked Mrs. Forman,
"Is he okay?"\\
87 - And she said yeah, because
he called her last night.\\
88 - Yeah, I mean, that is weird.\\
89 - Who would think that a boy
who plays with dolls\\
90 - and bails on his wedding
would be a mama's boy?\\
91 - I know a huge secret.\\
92 - But don't bother
to ask me, because\\
93 - there is no way in hell
I'm going to tell you.\\
94 - Kelso is gonna ask
Jackie to marry him.\\
95 - Wait, what?
Oh, my God!\\
96 - I can't believe you conniving
whores got it out of me!\\
97 - That is the dumbest thing
Kelso's said since his previous gem.\\
98 - "I can eat an entire shirt."\\
99 - This is so Michael.
Although it is kinda sweet.\\
100 - And I don't really have
anything going for me in my life.\\
101 - No job, no boyfriend.
I don't have anything!\\
102 - Okay, Jackie,
I know you're lonely,\\
103 - but you and Kelso getting
married, that's insane.\\
104 - Well, I actually think
it makes total sense.\\
105 - No, it doesn't.
It makes no sense!\\
106 - "Fliebedieflabediefloobedie"
makes more sense than that!\\
107 - What if it's fate?\\
108 - I mean, I have always thought
of Michael as my soul mate.\\
109 - I mean,
yes, we have our problems,\\
110 - but getting married
will fix everything.\\
111 - And if that doesn't work,
you can just have a kid.\\
112 - Oh, my God, I'm so excited!\\
113 - I wonder when he
is gonna ask me.\\
114 - Well, that is a secret.
At the Forman's party.\\
115 - You bitches are relentless!\\
116 - You guys! I just got offered
the best job in the world!\\
117 - I'm gonna be a security guard
at the Playboy Club in Chicago!\\
118 - How the hell did that happen?\\
119 - Okay, last week I
was in Chicago, right,\\
120 - and I did what I
always do after I visit\\
121 - my daughter, I snuck
into the Playboy Club.\\
122 - And as the guards
were kicking me out,\\
123 - I thought to myself,
I could do that!\\
124 - So then I talked
to this guy there.\\
125 - So, let me tell you
a little bit about\\
126 - what Vic does
around here at the club.\\
127 - Ah, wait, who's Vic?\\
128 - I'm Vic, keep up.\\
129 - What Vic does, is I'm responsible
for overseeing security here.\\
130 - You see, it is our job to
keep the girls safe and secure.\\
131 - Oh, yeah.\\
132 - Yeah, we're
safe and secure today.\\
133 - Uh-huh, lather it up, Brenda!\\
134 - Uh, Michael wants to see Brenda!\\
135 - No, employees only. We've got a
code of ethics around here, Michael.\\
136 - Right there.\\
137 - So, Vic tells me
you used to be a cop?\\
138 - Uh, wait, I thought
that you were Vic?\\
139 - There's another Vic,
try to keep up.\\
140 - Uh, yeah, well, I got...
I got kicked off the force.\\
141 - Then I was gonna make the move
here to be closer to my daughter.\\
142 - What, you're married? Obviously
you're not wearing a ring.\\
143 - Great minds think alike!\\
144 - Actually, uh,
I just got a girl pregnant.\\
145 - You got a girl pregnant?
I got a girl pregnant!\\
146 - Give Vic a high five!\\
147 - You Vic or the other Vic?\\
148 - The other Vic? What is
that some kind of a joke?\\
149 - The other Vic got both
his hands blown off in Nam.\\
150 - I'm just kidding!\\
151 - I like your sense of humor, kid.\\
152 - Now, come here,
all kidding aside,\\
153 - I want to ask you
something seriously.\\
154 - Do you like spicy food?\\
155 - Sure, I'll eat anything.
Actually, I put that on the resume.\\
156 - Try this salsa. Go on, makes you
feel like you got shot in the tongue.\\
157 - How can I say no to that?\\
158 - Yeah, that hot,
that's hot, right?\\
159 - You know it's hot when you get all
moist and sweaty up under here, eh?\\
160 - Come on, feel it! Ah, I don't
think I wanna touch Vic's head.\\
161 - No, go ahead, feel it.
No, I really don't.\\
162 - Feel it!
Okay.\\
163 - Ahh!
Ahh!\\
164 - Got you.\\
165 - And he just called
and offered me the job!\\
166 - Ah, man, it's like I was really
looking for some direction\\
167 - and that's why I
was gonna get married,\\
168 - but now that'd be
just like crazy, you know!\\
169 - Thank God I didn't
say anything to Jackie!\\
170 - Uh-oh, Kelso...\\
171 - Oh, man,
she has absolutely no idea!\\
172 - If I could just get a word in...\\
173 - For once in my life
I didn't just blurt\\
174 - something out and
then ruin everything!\\
175 - Yes, about that...
It's like I'm off scot-free!\\
176 - Kelso! Listen to me!\\
177 - I told Jackie you were
proposing and now she's thrilled.\\
178 - How could you do that?\\
179 - I know. I have a problem.\\
180 - Actually,
now you have a problem.\\
181 - So, good luck with that.\\
182 - You told Jackie
I was gonna propose to her?\\
183 - Yes, and you should have seen all
the squealing and jumping around!\\
184 - And Jackie was excited, too!\\
185 - You guys are idiots. Who gets
married on a whim, anyway?\\
186 - You did.\\
187 - Yeah,
but that was to a stripper!\\
188 - And to be fair,
I was pretty drunk,\\
189 - so I might have been trying
to say, "Will you carry me?"\\
190 - It's like I love Jackie,
okay and I know\\
191 - that some day we're gonna
be together, but just not yet.\\
192 - You fool, don't you understand?\\
193 - Hyde really screwed Jackie up,\\
194 - and she's only going to be
like this for a little while longer.\\
195 - You gotta strike when the
broad is still a mess, man!\\
196 - Look, Kelso, I'm completely
against this unholy union.\\
197 - But if you really want to be with
Jackie, you cannot run away now.\\
198 - She'll be so pissed she'll
never talk to you again.\\
199 - Okay, so, you're saying if I
don't go through with this now,\\
200 - I'm gonna blow my chance
with Jackie forever?\\
201 - Yes. You have successfully
repeated what I just said.\\
202 - All right.\\
203 - That's it. I wanna
ask Jackie to marry me.\\
204 - Great! Let's go buy a ring!\\
205 - No, Jackie once
said that she'd rather\\
206 - have a balloon tied
around her finger,\\
207 - than a diamond under two carats.\\
208 - So let's go buy a balloon!\\
209 - Jackie, you can't marry Kelso.\\
210 - Picture what your
life would be like.\\
211 - Hi, honey, how was your day?\\
212 - Ah, great.
I had another affair.\\
213 - What?\\
214 - Hey, you told me not to lie!\\
215 - Yeah, I told you
not to lie or cheat!\\
216 - Right and I chose not to lie!\\
217 - Well, can I at least have
some money for groceries?\\
218 - Sorry, babe, I got fired again,\\
219 - but I know what will
make you feel better.\\
220 - Oh, no!
Not another box of dogs!\\
221 - It's another box of dogs!\\
222 - Oh, no, no, no, Michael.
This is not the life I pictured.\\
223 - I had dreams of a career,
of travel.\\
224 - Of a husband who
didn't have a girlfriend.\\
225 - Babe, I hear ya,
I do, I really do.\\
226 - But you know what!
Pantsed you! Burn!\\
227 - Hey, kids,
I pantsed your mom again!\\
228 - Who wants to jump off the roof?\\
229 - That's your life, Jackie.\\
230 - Oh, yeah?\\
231 - Well, just for that, I'm gonna toss
my bouquet while you're in the can.\\
232 - Kitty? What is all this?\\
233 - Surprise! We're having
an anniversary party.\\
234 - But I don't want a party! I was
gonna take you to the boat show!\\
235 - I'm not going to a boat show.\\
236 - Fine! It's a vodka show,
just get in the car!\\
237 - Red, we have people coming over.\\
238 - But I had...\\
239 - Okay,\\
240 - I was thinking, about what
we did at the Starlight Motel\\
241 - for the first time between
our wedding and reception.\\
242 - And, uh, I thought we could go
there again, exactly 25 years later.\\
243 - So I got us the same room.\\
244 - To celebrate our
silver anniversary,\\
245 - you wanna take me for an
afternoon tryst to a cheap motel?\\
246 - That is so romantic.\\
247 - Man, I'm all ready
to propose and the Formans\\
248 - are late for their own 25th
anniversary party.\\
249 - Don't they realize
this is my night?\\
250 - When is Michael going to ask me?\\
251 - I can't stand the anticipation!\\
252 - This must be how
fat girls feel between\\
253 - placing their order
and getting their fries.\\
254 - Here, take this,
it will relax you.\\
255 - And if it doesn't work out
between you and Kelso,\\
256 - it'll loosen you up.
For me.\\
257 - Oh. Oh, my goodness.\\
258 - Oh.\\
259 - Everybody is here.
What time is it?\\
260 - Oh. Oh, I must have
left my watch at the...\\
261 - Ice store. But they were
out of ice. Every one of them.\\
262 - This country is in the crapper.\\
263 - Hello.\\
264 - Okay. Mrs. Forman,
that was the Starlight Motel.\\
265 - They, uh, found your watch
in the Aphrodite suite.\\
266 - Just keep the damn watch!\\
267 - Oh, hi, Eric!\\
268 - Oh, thanks, sweetie.\\
269 - Oh, Donna is right here,
why don't you say hi!\\
270 - Hi! Let me just
switch to another room.\\
271 - Oh. Okay. I'll talk to
you later, then. I love you.\\
272 - He had to run to class.
So, I'm gonna go grab a beer.\\
273 - The Aphrodite suite, huh?
Sounds like you guys Aphro-did-it!\\
274 - Hey, are you okay?
Totally.\\
275 - Yeah,
are you kidding. Totally.\\
276 - Look, I'm sure Eric
was just in a hurry.\\
277 - I have not been to Africa,
but if it's\\
278 - anything like
Disneyland's Jungle Safari,\\
279 - you gotta stay on your toes.\\
280 - I wouldn't know, I'm more of
an "it's a small world" kind of girl.\\
281 - Yeah, I do not like that ride.\\
282 - Why, it's too boring?\\
283 - No, I just feel the Irish
are under-represented.\\
284 - Yeah! Here, free six-pack.\\
285 - Okay, my turn.\\
286 - Mr. and Mrs. Forman,
your long and happy marriage\\
287 - got me thinking about my future.\\
288 - And when I think about my future\\
289 - there is always
someone special in it.\\
290 - I mean, besides me.\\
291 - So, in front of all
the people that I love,\\
292 - Jacqueline Burkhart,
will you marry me?\\
293 - Oh, Michael! No.\\
294 - Congratu...
What the hell?\\
295 - No?
No.\\
296 - Jackie,\\
297 - you have just made me
the happiest man in the world!\\
298 - Really?\\
299 - Yeah!\\
300 - Oh, man!\\
301 - I mean, I love you
and all, but, it's like\\
302 - this is, like, the worst
idea I've ever had!\\
303 - And I have had some bad ideas!
I mean, a fire-cracker suit?\\
304 - Like, what the hell was that?\\
305 - The best 4th of
June ever, that's what.\\
306 - Michael, if you and I got
married it would be a disaster.\\
307 - I mean I love you, but you
have so much growing up to do.\\
308 - Oh, and I do not want a box
of puppies running around.\\
309 - You see and I do!
I know!\\
310 - Oh, man! This is, like,
my life is finally taking off.\\
311 - I'm moving to Chicago!\\
312 - Donna, I hope I
did the right thing.\\
313 - You know. I'm so happy,
I'm gonna jump off the roof!\\
314 - You did the right thing. Yeah.\\
315 - So it's the last
circle before I go.\\
316 - Wait a minute, now I
get why we call it a circle!\\
317 - That is freakin' awesome!\\
318 - You know Michael, I will always
remember the first boy who kissed me.\\
319 - And proposed to me and told me
that putting out makes your nails grow.\\
320 - I really believed you.\\
321 - Kelso, I'm kinda gonna miss you\\
322 - constantly trying
to grab my boob.\\
323 - Made me feel pretty.\\
324 - I am messed up.\\
325 - Donna, I give you my word.
I will always be here,\\
326 - trying to grab your boob.
We'll do it for Kelso,\\
327 - who won't be here
to do it anymore.\\
328 - Oh, God.\\
329 - Man...
Kelso, this is weird.\\
330 - I always imagined
our last moment together\\
331 - would be me watching you
strapped to a home-made rocket\\
332 - flying around in circles
screaming, "Turn it off! Turn it off!"\\
333 - Well. I guess
this is goodbye.\\
334 - Man, I'm gonna miss this.\\
335 - Like, being down here, I've
had, like, the best time of my life.\\
336 - And you know what? No matter
where I live, I will love you guys forever.\\
337 - Well, I guess it's
time to go. So, see ya.\\
338 - Bye, Michael.\\
339 - Wow. He is really gone.\\
340 - My beautiful tormentor.\\
341 - This sucks.\\
342 - I'm not leaving till tomorrow!
And you were crying!\\
343 - Burn!\\
344 - Can it be?\\
345 - It finally happened!
I won!\\
346 - I won! I
won! I won! I won! I won!\\
347 - I won! I won! I won a bike!
Read it and weep, loser!\\
348 - That expired yesterday.\\
349 - I'll kill you!
\subsection {Episode 05: Stone Cold Crazy}
1 - Oh, no, don't get up,
I'm just right here anyway.\\
2 - I'll help you, Mrs. Forman.\\
3 - Oh, no,
don't you worry, Samantha.\\
4 - It's just a little unbalanced because our
appropriate-sized clothes are on one side\\
5 - and your little teeny tiny
stripper clothes are on the other.\\
6 - I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so grumpy.\\
7 - I got a manicure yesterday and
Red still hasn't said a darn word.\\
8 - You know, if you really
want him to notice you,\\
9 - you should get drunk and
do some donuts on his lawn.\\
10 - Mrs. Forman,
you should change your hair.\\
11 - When I went blond,
Eric went nuts.\\
12 - And then Fez went nuts and
then I started wearing a lot of hats.\\
13 - No, I can't change my hair.
Red loves it. It's my trademark.\\
14 - It'd be like telling
Fonzie not to say, "Hey!"\\
15 - Mrs. Forman, a great
way to get a man's attention\\
16 - is to show him
how smart you are.\\
17 - But a faster way is to
take your clothes off.\\
18 - - I can help you
work on some moves.
- Mmm-hmm.\\
19 - Oh,
no, I don't need to see that.\\
20 - It'd be like
watching my mom strip.\\
21 - Which, unfortunately, I saw
at Take Your Son to Work Day.\\
22 - No, you know what,
I'll just, um...\\
23 - I'll just spray on some of
my special occasion perfume.\\
24 - It's very expensive, but you put a little
water in there, you can really make it last.\\
25 - Hey, Sam.
Can I ask you something?\\
26 - Um, I wanted to send Eric some,
you know, like, sexy pictures.\\
27 - Sure,
I have some 8x10s in my car.\\
28 - Of me.\\
29 - Anyway, um,
would you mind taking them?\\
30 - I'd love to! I have a great pair
of thigh-high boots you can use.\\
31 - Oh, I don't think
we're the same size.\\
32 - Oh, you're not gonna wear
them, silly. You're gonna lick them!\\
33 - Oh, hi, Jackie.
"Hang in there, baby."\\
34 - And the kitten is hanging.
Funny.\\
35 - So, what the hell are you
doing in my apartment?\\
36 - Oh, well, since Michael moved to
Chicago, he let me have his room.\\
37 - We're gonna be roommates!\\
38 - Roommates? Hot diggity!\\
39 - Think of the wacky adventures
we will have.\\
40 - We're gonna
take the plunge now\\
41 - We're gonna
dive right in now\\
42 - We're gonna have it all\\
43 - We don't believe in maybe\\
44 - "Can't" is
a word we'll never know\\
45 - Sometimes we'll
have our struggles\\
46 - But, oh, baby, oh\\
47 - We're gonna
take our chance now\\
48 - Fly by
the seat of our pants now\\
49 - When we're divided, we fall\\
50 - And we're
really gonna have it all\\
51 - And we're really
gonna have it all\\
52 - Fez, that is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. Catchy tune, though.\\
53 - Hanging out\\
54 - Down the street\\
55 - The same old thing\\
56 - We did last week\\
57 - Not a thing to do\\
58 - But talk to you\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - We're all all right\\
61 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
62 - Okay, Jackie, I'm off to work.\\
63 - Wait, but we're roomies!\\
64 - What am I supposed to do
while you are gone?\\
65 - Listen, when I get home, it's you
and me, we'll do whatever you want.\\
66 - Oh! The Wizard of Oz is on TV tonight!
We can watch it and make fun of Kansas!\\
67 - It's a date! I love
those little munchkins.\\
68 - I wish I could represent
the Lollipop Guild.\\
69 - Boy, there'd be some changes!\\
70 - I can't believe I let you
take naked pictures of me.\\
71 - I don't really get that one with
the G.I. Joe between your boobs,\\
72 - but, hey,
you know Eric better than me!\\
73 - Hi, sweetie. Oh, a letter for
Eric. Want me to mail it for you?\\
74 - No, no, no, I got it.\\
75 - But I love going
to the post office!\\
76 - I have these funny things I say
when the line is moving slow, like,\\
77 - "Hey, where did I
park my dinosaur?"\\
78 - Um, okay. But you know it's
illegal to tamper with mail, right?\\
79 - Yeah, but it's not illegal to
complain about a slow-moving line!\\
80 - Hey, can we speed it up?
My pet snail is getting away!\\
81 - That's good stuff, Dad.\\
82 - Have a brownie, Red.\\
83 - Something smells terrific.\\
84 - You noticed.\\
85 - Sure did!\\
86 - You put peanut
butter in the brownies!\\
87 - Samantha!\\
88 - Okay, stripping is all about
the art of seduction.\\
89 - So the first thing you wanna do is set
the mood. Like with music, or candles.\\
90 - Oh, oh. All I have are those trick
candles, the ones you can't blow out.\\
91 - They make Red furious,
it's very funny.\\
92 - I always start my routine
by slowly removing my gloves.\\
93 - I have gloves!\\
94 - Feel sexy already!\\
95 - You know what?
Let's skip ahead.\\
96 - Look your husband in the eye
and go step, dip, hair, flip.\\
97 - You try it!\\
98 - Okay. Step, dip, hair, flip.\\
99 - That's great.\\
100 - For our next lesson, I'll teach
you how to pick up money\\
101 - using everything but your hands.\\
102 - Hey, Kitty! Taking Donna's letter
for Eric over to the post office.\\
103 - - Got anything to eat? I mean mail.
- Oh, you know what?\\
104 - Why don't you leave this with
me? I have to add some things.\\
105 - Like today's Marmaduke,
it's a stitch!\\
106 - Okay.\\
107 - Have a brownie, Bob.\\
108 - - That's what I
was waiting for!
- Mmm-hmm.\\
109 - Oh, Marmaduke,
when will you ever learn?\\
110 - Donna?\\
111 - Oh, my!\\
112 - G.I. Joe?\\
113 - Mrs. Forman,
the washer is acting up again!\\
114 - Um, okay, okay! Coming!\\
115 - Where's those damn car keys?\\
116 - Good Lord!\\
117 - Steven,
you could have fixed that!\\
118 - Well, I'm off to work. So if
you need me, I'll be at the Hub.\\
119 - Oh, no!\\
120 - Oh, no!\\
121 - Oh, please, no!\\
122 - All right, Kitty, Kitty, don't
panic. You know what to do.\\
123 - Holy crap, it's Caroline!\\
124 - Who is Caroline?\\
125 - She went out with Fez.\\
126 - But he broke up with her
'cause she's crazy.\\
127 - Which is ironic,
because that's probably why\\
128 - she went out with
him in the first place.\\
129 - Guys, I can't let her see me.
Hide me.\\
130 - Where should we hide you, Fez?\\
131 - Fez!\\
132 - - Well played,
you son of a bitch.
- Hi!\\
133 - Hi! Caroline, you look good.\\
134 - Not quite so nuts.\\
135 - Yeah, I'm doing much better
thanks to my therapist.\\
136 - And my meds.
And some good old-fashioned...\\
137 - Electricity.\\
138 - But there is one thing about
me that hasn't changed.\\
139 - Is it that you can still spin
your head all the way around?\\
140 - No!\\
141 - It's that I still have a thirst for hot
chocolate, you know what I mean.\\
142 - I do. I still have a thirst for
crazy, medicated white women.\\
143 - So, uh, maybe I
could come over tonight?\\
144 - I mean, if there are no other women in
your life, 'cause I couldn't handle that.\\
145 - No, the only other women
in Fez's life are in his head.\\
146 - But you must know about that.
You got a cast of thousands up there.\\
147 - Shut up!\\
148 - So, you just invited me over for
some brownies in the middle of the day?\\
149 - Yes.\\
150 - Oh, and I opened your mail and I saw your
nudie pictures. Would you like some milk?\\
151 - What?\\
152 - Oh, my God!\\
153 - Your father gave me the letter, I
just wanted to add some things.\\
154 - Well, did you mail the pictures?\\
155 - No, but I will as
soon as I find them.\\
156 - What?\\
157 - Well, don't worry,
I'm sure nobody else saw them.\\
158 - Hey, Kitty, have you seen
the car keys? Oh, Donna.\\
159 - Oh, my God, you, too?\\
160 - I was looking for
the damn car keys!\\
161 - This drawer is for car keys
and magnets, that's it.\\
162 - Well, where are they now?\\
163 - Whoa!\\
164 - Holy hell!\\
165 - I know, man.
Where's Marmaduke?\\
166 - Hey.\\
167 - Hey, Donna.\\
168 - What is so funny?\\
169 - Guess I'm just a happy guy.\\
170 - Hey, it's the naked lady
from the newspaper!\\
171 - Okay, here it comes.\\
172 - Uh, I have just
one question for you.\\
173 - Does my wife know
you were licking her boots?\\
174 - Donna, I'm writing a letter
to the newspaper\\
175 - about your photo essay.
Here's what I have so far.\\
176 - Yes!\\
177 - Okay, just tell me
where the pictures are.\\
178 - Hey, not to worry. I hid
them in a Barry White album.\\
179 - Great. Where's that?\\
180 - You'll have to ask
the guy who bought it. Duh.\\
181 - Knock, knock. Who's there?\\
182 - Fez! And Barry White.\\
183 - Hey, Fez. It is
almost Wizard of Oz time.\\
184 - And I did my hair like Dorothy, but
since there are no foreigners in Oz,\\
185 - I created a new
character for you.\\
186 - The butler.\\
187 - Oh. Bad news, racist Dorothy.\\
188 - Something has come up.
Some unexpected doing it.\\
189 - You remember Caroline?\\
190 - What, with the crazy nut-job who said
she was gonna scratch my eyes out?\\
191 - Yes. Sweet girl.\\
192 - Look, she is coming over tonight and
she gets very jealous of other women\\
193 - so you're gonna have to leave.\\
194 - Where am I supposed to go?\\
195 - I don't know, just click your heels
three times and get the hell out.\\
196 - Fez, I am not gonna leave
my own apartment.\\
197 - Okay. You know, you're right.
I'm being unreasonable.\\
198 - Just go into your room and
don't come out until morning.\\
199 - And eat quiet foods only. Yogurt,
marshmallows, maybe cotton candy.\\
200 - But save me some,
because I just love it.\\
201 - I can't believe this, I mean, we made
a plan to watch The Wizard of Oz.\\
202 - Yes, and then I was offered sex,
so, ding dong, the plan is dead!\\
203 - Oh, crap,
did we blow a fuse again?\\
204 - Kitty? What are you doing?\\
205 - Making your day, sailor.\\
206 - And step, dip, hair, flip.\\
207 - Kitty, watch the candles! Oh,
my God. Your hair is on fire!\\
208 - What? Am I out?\\
209 - Wow. This is really nice.\\
210 - Oh, it's been so long since
I've sat and talked to a man\\
211 - and been able to
move my own arms freely.\\
212 - Whose mascara is that? Fez,
is there another woman here?\\
213 - What?
No, no! It's... It's mine.\\
214 - Yeah, lashes like this
don't come naturally, baby.\\
215 - Um, why don't you go to the kitchen
and, um, open us a bottle of wine?\\
216 - Well, my doctor says I'm not
supposed to drink while I take my meds,\\
217 - but what he doesn't know
is I didn't take my meds.\\
218 - What are you doing?\\
219 - Well,
I have to go to the bathroom.\\
220 - Well, you should have thought of
that before I locked you in your room!\\
221 - Fez, where is the corkscrew?\\
222 - Um,
it's under the sink, my dear!\\
223 - Look, you are supposed to stay in
your room! I even gave you quiet foods!\\
224 - Yeah, okay, the yogurt you
gave me expired two months ago\\
225 - and it's smells
like vomit and peach.\\
226 - Honey?\\
227 - Yes, baby?\\
228 - I can't find...
Where did you get that yogurt?\\
229 - Oh, I keep yogurt all over
my apartment. I love it.\\
230 - See?\\
231 - Yum. That's the stuff.\\
232 - So, did you find that
corkscrew, honey pie?\\
233 - Not yet.\\
234 - Fez, I'm not like you. I don't know
how to entertain myself in the dark.\\
235 - Oh, here it is!\\
236 - I want to watch
The Wizard of Oz!\\
237 - Okay, a scarecrow gets a
brain, a lion gets some courage\\
238 - and the robot gets a heart.\\
239 - You know, when I was in the kitchen, I
wanted to carve our initials into my arm.\\
240 - But that's what the old
crazy me would have done.\\
241 - So I carved them
into your countertop instead.\\
242 - Well, look who's all better.\\
243 - Please, Leo, you have to
remember who you sold that record to.\\
244 - Think.
Who have you seen today?\\
245 - Well, I remember a guy with
scraggly hair and a beard.\\
246 - And he was brushing his teeth.\\
247 - That was you in a mirror.\\
248 - And then there's this other guy with
big lips and another guy with long hair.\\
249 - And another guy
with a thumbtack in his head.\\
250 - That would be
the Aerosmith poster.\\
251 - You know, I have been trapped
in this vortex before.\\
252 - There is a way we
can jog his memory.\\
253 - It was Fez, man!\\
254 - Okay, Red.\\
255 - You're not gonna be happy.\\
256 - My stylist said there wasn't enough
left up there to salvage my old hairdo,\\
257 - so, I'm sorry, but...\\
258 - Wow! Look at you!\\
259 - Do you like it?\\
260 - Hubba hubba!\\
261 - Really? I've been trying so
hard to get you to notice me\\
262 - and all I had to do
was set my hair on fire.\\
263 - How would you like to go upstairs
and let me see it in the dark?\\
264 - Or we could leave the lights on.\\
265 - Well, that was a nice appetizer,\\
266 - but I believe the main course
will be served in the bedroom.\\
267 - Yes.
I am going to brush my teeth.\\
268 - - Yogurt breath.
- Oh.\\
269 - Why don't you go in
and put on some Barry White?\\
270 - Where are they, you pervert?\\
271 - Donna, you have to leave!\\
272 - I'm not going anywhere
without my pictures!\\
273 - Shh! What pictures?\\
274 - The naked ones of me, the ones in
the Barry White record you bought.\\
275 - Ah, crap.\\
276 - What the hell are these?\\
277 - And what is she doing here?\\
278 - Will you give me those?\\
279 - Fez, I thought you
said you lived alone!\\
280 - I do!
She's just visiting! I swear!\\
281 - There's no one
else that lives here.\\
282 - Screw this! You know what? I'm
not gonna sit locked up in my room\\
283 - with stale marshmallows.
I live here, too!\\
284 - Well,
that's incredibly bad timing.\\
285 - Two women?\\
286 - Okay. Caroline, I have
to be honest with you.\\
287 - Juanita and Maria
Jose are my maids.\\
288 - Well, then! They can
clean up all of your blood!\\
289 - Okay, here's how
you make fruit salad.\\
290 - First,
let me squeeze those melons.\\
291 - Oh,
aren't they nice and firm?\\
292 - Yes. Now grab my banana.\\
293 - Oh, it's huge!\\
294 - All right, you perverts,
stop it right now.\\
295 - Another fruit salad?\\
296 - Why can't they
ever be having sex?
\subsection {Episode 06: Long Away}
1 - Oh, Steven, there you are.\\
2 - I almost didn't
recognize you without\\
3 - a disgusting stripper
attached to your lips.\\
4 - Huh? Well,
I recognized you right away.\\
5 - Since you walked in here alone,
with no job and no boyfriend.\\
6 - Oh, this sounds like fun.\\
7 - Someone say
something mean about me.\\
8 - I don't think so, Fez.\\
9 - Oh, come on,
you never let me play.\\
10 - Fine. You're stupid
and you're fat.\\
11 - That was
completely uncalled for.\\
12 - What is Donna
doing out with Randy?\\
13 - When I called her earlier today\\
14 - to see if she
wanted to do something,\\
15 - she said she was
staying in all day.\\
16 - I mean, I was gonna blow her
off at the last minute, but still.\\
17 - Yeah. And yesterday when I
went to spy on her from her closet,\\
18 - she was already out with Randy.\\
19 - That guy is really
cutting into my peep-time.\\
20 - Do you think something is going
on between Donna and Randy?\\
21 - Steven, what do you think?\\
22 - I have a definite
opinion on this.\\
23 - I don't care.\\
24 - You just don't like to gossip.\\
25 - Which is good,
because you should\\
26 - hear what people say about you.\\
27 - Well, if you guys
are gonna act like\\
28 - a bunch of immature
babies, go ahead.\\
29 - Now, if you'll excuse me,\\
30 - I'm gonna drive my car
through some really big puddles\\
31 - and splash some old people.\\
32 - Hey.
Hi.\\
33 - Where have you two been?\\
34 - We went and saw Rocky II.
It was awesome.\\
35 - This chubby guy in the
audience got all inspired\\
36 - and then punched out an usher.\\
37 - Donna, does Eric know you took
another man to the movies?\\
38 - Actually, I invited her. I won
tickets from a radio station.\\
39 - My cousin's a DJ.\\
40 - So I just called him up and
told him the phrase that pays.\\
41 - My mom has a picture of you
and your sister in the bathtub.\\
42 - But, why I wonder, did you
invite Donna instead of any of us?\\
43 - Is it because she is
beautiful, blonde and curvy?\\
44 - Actually, you know what,
that's a good choice.\\
45 - Fries up for Donna and Randy.\\
46 - That's us.\\
47 - Look at them!
They're sharing fries!\\
48 - I know. And did you see how
fast Randy changed the subject\\
49 - when you mentioned Eric?\\
50 - Yeah, something
is definitely up.\\
51 - The needle on the Hanky-Panky
meter is all the way up to Panky!\\
52 - You know what? I think
Donna is cheating on Eric.\\
53 - Oh, my God,
I think you're right.\\
54 - That is awful.\\
55 - I can just picture that
hot-blooded seductress\\
56 - giving it away in
a sweaty moment of lust.\\
57 - Oh, why do I do that to myself?\\
58 - Hanging out\\
59 - Down the street\\
60 - The same old thing\\
61 - We did last week\\
62 - Not a thing to do\\
63 - But talk to you\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - We're all all right\\
66 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
67 - Kitty! I just got
a letter from the\\
68 - Point Place
Veterans Association.\\
69 - Our reunion is coming up.\\
70 - It is so nice to have a place
where everyone applauds\\
71 - after you say how
many people you shot.\\
72 - And this year is
gonna be special.\\
73 - You remember Larry Simmens?\\
74 - The fellow who
won the Bronze Star on D-Day?\\
75 - Yep. The bastard
finally died.\\
76 - Struck by lightning.\\
77 - The sucker could dodge a bullet\\
78 - but Mother Nature got
him right in the ass.\\
79 - Well, I hope someone shouted,
"Fire in the hole."\\
80 - And now that he's gone,\\
81 - I'll be the most
decorated soldier there.\\
82 - Which means the added respect
of my peers plus enough free booze\\
83 - to fill Mike Kaleigh's fake leg.\\
84 - You know,
whenever you soldier buddies\\
85 - get together you have cocktails.\\
86 - I should have been in the army.\\
87 - Hey, look!
I finally got invited to\\
88 - the Point Place
veterans' reunion. What?\\
89 - They don't invite
National Guardsmen.\\
90 - They didn't.
But I wrote a bunch of\\
91 - angry letters until they
changed their policy.\\
92 - Well, that's just great, Bob.\\
93 - Maybe if you'd written a
bunch of angry letters to Hitler\\
94 - we could've avoided
a war in the first place.\\
95 - I don't think that
would have worked.\\
96 - That Hitler seemed
like a real cranky bear.\\
97 - Oh, Red, the vets needed
someone to hire a photographer.\\
98 - So I signed you up to find one.\\
99 - Why would you do that?\\
100 - Because I felt like I
wasn't contributing.\\
101 - You should hire Leo
to be your photographer.\\
102 - He's like a pro.
Shot all my fake IDs.\\
103 - I'm not taking a hippie
down to the Veterans Hall.\\
104 - They wouldn't put up with it.\\
105 - The bathrooms have
Jane Fonda urinal targets.\\
106 - You know, Leo took some pretty
great pictures of Bob and Midge\\
107 - when they renewed their vows.\\
108 - He even got a rare
one of Red smiling.\\
109 - I sent it to the museum.\\
110 - Well, if you wanna ask him,
he's down in the basement.\\
111 - What's Leo doing in my basement?\\
112 - I don't know.\\
113 - But, just to be safe,
why don't you give it\\
114 - about 15 minutes
before you come down?\\
115 - So, Leo, Steven tells me
that you're a photographer.\\
116 - How much do you charge?\\
117 - Not much, man. I try to
pay for everything with cash.\\
118 - Okay, never mind.\\
119 - Come on, Red, he's really
good and he works cheap.\\
120 - Leo, tell him what your fee is.\\
121 - A hundred bucks.\\
122 - How about $75?\\
123 - $50 and that's my final offer.\\
124 - And if you bargain with him
when you get there,\\
125 - you'll probably wind
up making 10 bucks.\\
126 - $15.\\
127 - Okay, fine, you're hired.\\
128 - But this is a big night for me.\\
129 - So I want you to
clean up and look nice.\\
130 - These men are veterans.
They deserve your respect.\\
131 - Hey, I'm cool
with veterans, man.\\
132 - Anybody that can put
a cast on a dog is okay by me.\\
133 - Hey, if you guys see Donna, can
you tell her I'm down at The Hub?\\
134 - Okay, did you guys have plans?\\
135 - Yeah, we were gonna
hang out at her house,\\
136 - but I get a little
uncomfortable with Bob there.\\
137 - You know, most people wear
underwear when they wear a robe.\\
138 - Did you hear that?
"Hang out."\\
139 - They are going to have sex.\\
140 - How does hang out mean have sex?\\
141 - I can make a sexual innuendo
out of anything.\\
142 - Try me.\\
143 - Stove.\\
144 - Well, I'd like to cook
something on her stove.\\
145 - See? Anything!\\
146 - Oh, my God, Fez,
I feel really bad for Eric.\\
147 - When Michael was cheating
on me, I was devastated.\\
148 - But eventually I learned
that the saying is true.\\
149 - It's better to have loved
and lost than to be butt-ugly.\\
150 - Oh, hey, Miss Kitty.\\
151 - Hi.
Okay.\\
152 - We need some advice.\\
153 - There is this guy whose
girlfriend is cheating on him.\\
154 - What do you think we should do?\\
155 - Well, Red and I once had
a friend named Bill Anderson\\
156 - and everyone thought his
wife was cheating on him.\\
157 - So one night, we were over there\\
158 - and I happened to see her purse\\
159 - and it happened to be open
and I happened to riffle through it\\
160 - and I found out it was true.\\
161 - So you told Bill?\\
162 - No, no, no, no.\\
163 - I do not like to get involved
in other people's business.\\
164 - But I wish I had.\\
165 - Because it might have
saved their marriage\\
166 - and I'd still be getting
their Christmas cards.\\
167 - Antlers on a dog,
that is so precious.\\
168 - Fez, I know what we need to do.\\
169 - Yeah, me, too.
But where are we\\
170 - going to find
a dog with antlers?\\
171 - No, Fez. We need
to write Eric a letter\\
172 - telling him what is going on
between Donna and Randy.\\
173 - Yeah, then Eric
is gonna come home,\\
174 - kick Randy's ass and then whisk
Donna off to someplace sexy.\\
175 - Like the garage.\\
176 - What?\\
177 - How is the garage sexy?\\
178 - Well, I'd like to park
my car in her garage.\\
179 - Leo? This is
an important event.\\
180 - I thought I told
you to clean up.\\
181 - I did, man.
My apartment is spotless.\\
182 - You're supposed to wear a
military uniform to these things.\\
183 - That's why I rented this baby.\\
184 - Just be ready with
that camera, Leo.\\
185 - And keep it
pointed nice and low.\\
186 - I want a lot of close-ups of all
those patriotic men kissing my ass.\\
187 - Hey there, soldiers.\\
188 - Holy cow!
Look who it is!\\
189 - As you were, men.\\
190 - It's Leonard.\\
191 - Leonard?
Who the hell is Leonard?\\
192 - Hey, I'm Leonard.\\
193 - Hey!\\
194 - Hi there!\\
195 - Hey, how do you guys know him?\\
196 - We drove a supply truck
together during World War II.\\
197 - Leo? You're a veteran?\\
198 - How come you never told me?\\
199 - Well, there is a lot of things
you don't know about me, man.\\
200 - For instance, I'm a veteran.\\
201 - It's been two weeks since
we send Eric our letter.\\
202 - Shouldn't he be home by now?\\
203 - Well, it takes about a week
to get a letter to Africa,\\
204 - then there is three days of
Eric twitching and fidgeting.\\
205 - Oh, then there is a two day
hippo-ride to the airport.\\
206 - So, yeah,
he should be home by now.\\
207 - When is Samantha
coming back anyway?\\
208 - Oh, she's gotta stay
in Vegas for another\\
209 - week 'cause there's
a doctors convention.\\
210 - Which proves my
theory that no one\\
211 - gets tired of
seeing naked ladies.\\
212 - Hey, Donna,
I'm glad you're here.\\
213 - Have you heard from Eric? You
know, your supposed boyfriend?\\
214 - Actually I haven't
heard from Eric in a while.\\
215 - Really?\\
216 - Hey, look, Fez,
it says right here\\
217 - some moron got
punched in the arm\\
218 - for sticking his nose
where it didn't belong.\\
219 - When?\\
220 - Now.\\
221 - So, Donna.\\
222 - I don't know, is there any relationship
news you'd like to share with us?\\
223 - Look, I really don't
want to talk about it.\\
224 - Oh! So that means, there
is something to talk about?\\
225 - Yeah. Spill it, girl!\\
226 - Will you just drop it?\\
227 - No. Not until you tell us
when Eric is coming home.\\
228 - What? He is not coming home.\\
229 - Eric broke up with me.\\
230 - Yes!\\
231 - Is not what you say
when you hear that news.\\
232 - Did you two have something to do\\
233 - with Forman and
Donna breaking up?\\
234 - Are you suggesting...\\
235 - Yeah, yes, we did.\\
236 - But we never...\\
237 - Actually we did that, too.\\
238 - But you can also blame...\\
239 - Actually there is
no one else to blame.\\
240 - Look, Steven, all we did
was write a letter to Eric\\
241 - telling him that Donna was
cheating on him with Randy.\\
242 - What, my magic 8-ball
said it was a good idea\\
243 - and that thing is
right like, what,\\
244 - one out of six times which
is pretty good for a ball.\\
245 - If you two were puppies, I'd smack
you in the nose with a magazine.\\
246 - In fact...\\
247 - You two idiots need
to tell Donna what you did.\\
248 - Are you kidding?\\
249 - No, no, no, no. She'll stomp
on us with her giant feet.\\
250 - I do not want the last words
I hear to be Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum!\\
251 - Yeah. It's gonna get ugly. That's
why I'm gonna come with you.\\
252 - To protect us?
No, to watch.\\
253 - I can't believe
that Leo is a veteran.\\
254 - I don't know whether
to like him a little more\\
255 - or like myself a little less.\\
256 - Red, this was supposed
to be your special night.\\
257 - We should be the ones
over there getting free drinks.\\
258 - We?\\
259 - I spent all my
money on this costume.\\
260 - So, Leo, what exactly
did you do in the war?\\
261 - I mean, besides just
drive a supply truck.\\
262 - Just drive a supply truck? Leo,
did you tell them what you did?\\
263 - No. It's embarrassing.\\
264 - You gotta tell them.\\
265 - All right.
I peed on Jane Fonda.\\
266 - Leo here drove his truck right
into a German tank formation\\
267 - and rescued an entire platoon.\\
268 - Really?\\
269 - Didn't you get a medal for that?\\
270 - Yeah.
I forget what it was called,\\
271 - but it was shaped
like a purple heart.\\
272 - Damn, Leo.\\
273 - I'm impressed.\\
274 - From one veteran to another,
I'd like to buy you a drink.\\
275 - Actually I'd like
to buy you a drink.\\
276 - I'll take a drink.\\
277 - Sorry. This round is for men
who fought for Uncle Sam.\\
278 - Not spent the war hiding
in their Uncle Sam's house.\\
279 - Hey, man, even if he didn't see
action, he still deserves a drink.\\
280 - All right, fine.\\
281 - Bartender, one Shirley Temple!\\
282 - Hey, Donna, sorry to interrupt,\\
283 - but Nancy Drew
and Nancy-boy here\\
284 - have something
they'd like to tell you.\\
285 - That's where Fez comes in.
Take it away, Fez.\\
286 - You sneaky little midget.\\
287 - Okay. Donna...\\
288 - We are the reason why
Eric broke up with you.\\
289 - We wrote him
a letter saying that\\
290 - you were cheating
with Mr. Fancy Hair.\\
291 - What? Oh, come on,
how does he even do that?\\
292 - Let me clear
a couple of things up.\\
293 - Donna and I are just friends\\
294 - and I blow dry this
hair upside down.\\
295 - Why would you even think
that I was cheating with Randy?\\
296 - Oh, they have it on
the strongest authority.\\
297 - A fluid-filled plastic novelty
ball from Parker Brothers.\\
298 - Look, the reason that we've been\\
299 - hanging out so
much lately is because\\
300 - Randy was the only
one I could talk to\\
301 - about how Eric broke up with me.\\
302 - Three weeks ago.\\
303 - Three weeks ago?
That means...\\
304 - That he broke up with you
before we sent the letter.\\
305 - Fez, it's not our fault!\\
306 - Oh, Eric just doesn't like
Donna anymore. Oh, happy day!\\
307 - Why didn't you tell us?\\
308 - Because I knew that if I told you
guys, Fez would only hit on me,\\
309 - Jackie would hurt my
feelings trying to be nice\\
310 - and you would
just shrug and go...\\
311 - How can you say that?
Tell me I'm wrong.\\
312 - Nah.\\
313 - And it's not like I went
looking for Randy. I mean...\\
314 - I was taking
the garbage out one day.\\
315 - He was playing hoops and
he said, "Hey, how is it going?"\\
316 - So I took the basketball,\\
317 - I threw it through a window
and burst into tears.\\
318 - I think that's when he knew
that something was wrong.\\
319 - I'm very astute.\\
320 - And he's been really great.
He listened, he brought me stuff.\\
321 - Ice cream,
Kleenex and bubble bath.\\
322 - It's the universal break-up kit.\\
323 - I read about it in Vogue.\\
324 - I have five sisters.\\
325 - Fine, I don't have any
sisters. I read Vogue!\\
326 - Donna, this must have
been really hard on you.\\
327 - Yeah. I can't believe
Eric and Donna are through.\\
328 - I always thought they'd
live happily ever after,\\
329 - like Romeo and Juliet.\\
330 - Have you ever read
Romeo and Juliet?\\
331 - I didn't have to finish it.
It is so obvious what happens.\\
332 - I'm sorry. I should have never
accused you for cheating on Eric.\\
333 - Yeah. And Randy,
I owe you an apology.\\
334 - Not just for the letter,\\
335 - but for letting the air
out of your tires.\\
336 - That's okay, man.
We're even.\\
337 - We are?
What did you do to me?\\
338 - This!\\
339 - I heard that makes
you pee yourself.\\
340 - That's ridiculous!\\
341 - This isn't over!\\
342 - I'm so surprised
you were in the army, Leo.\\
343 - I just can't picture
you shining your shoes.\\
344 - Can't really picture
you finding your shoes.\\
345 - Yeah, well,
I fought for my country\\
346 - and I have
the scars to prove it.\\
347 - Hey, me, too. Look at that.\\
348 - Guadalcanal, 1942.\\
349 - I took some shrapnel,
spent a month in the hospital.\\
350 - That's how I met Bob Hope.\\
351 - Bastard made me laugh even
though I had two busted ribs.\\
352 - Dumb ass comedian.\\
353 - Check this out.\\
354 - I don't see anything.\\
355 - Yeah, it's more of
an emotional scar.\\
356 - Leo, I don't understand how you\\
357 - could go from decorated war hero\\
358 - to hippie degenerate.\\
359 - Well, it all started the day
I got back to the States.\\
360 - My buddy and I
were saying goodbye.\\
361 - What are you gonna do now
that the war is over, Leonard?\\
362 - First I'm going back home to
work in my dad's pharmacy for a bit\\
363 - and then it's off
to medical school.\\
364 - See you, pal.\\
365 - And then these jazz
musicians pulled up in a car.\\
366 - Hey, soldier.
Do you need a ride?\\
367 - No, it smells kind
of funny in there.\\
368 - Don't worry, kid.
You'll get used to it.\\
369 - And that's
the last thing I remember\\
370 - until you poured me
this cup of coffee.\\
371 - Yep.\\
372 - Hey, man.
Hi.\\
373 - Brought you
something to cheer you up.\\
374 - A picture of Eric.\\
375 - And a lighter.\\
376 - Thanks.
I'll burn it later.\\
377 - I don't really know what to say.\\
378 - You wanna tell me what happened?\\
379 - Yeah, I mean, it wasn't
really that big of a surprise.\\
380 - Eric said that ever
since he left for Africa,\\
381 - he felt like our
lives were drifting apart.\\
382 - So he decided, for the both
of us, that we should move on.\\
383 - So, I guess we moved on.\\
384 - You all right?
Yeah. I will be.\\
385 - Eventually.\\
386 - Well, if you need anything,
you know where I'll be.\\
387 - Thanks, Hyde.\\
388 - And if you need anything
from me, you know where I'll be.\\
389 - Thanks, Fez.\\
390 - Dear Eric.
It turns out Donna\\
391 - was not doing it
with Randy after all.\\
392 - I jumped to
the wrong conclusion.\\
393 - But I learned my lesson.
And it won't happen again.\\
394 - It was so nice having you over,
Leo. You have a safe trip home.\\
395 - And don't worry.
I remember where I live.\\
396 - Eric, I have horrible news. Your
mom and Leo are having an affair!
\subsection {Episode 07: Fun It}
1 - What the hell is going on here?\\
2 - Well, these guys were supposed
to go on a three-hour tour,\\
3 - but now they're shipwrecked.\\
4 - And the sexual tension
between Gilligan and the Skipper\\
5 - is reaching a breaking point.\\
6 - This show's stupid.\\
7 - Why don't they just
kill the fat one for food?\\
8 - I'm not talking about Gilligan.\\
9 - I'm talking about the
new guy sitting in my chair.\\
10 - Fez, the chairs are
first come, first served.\\
11 - We decided that in the
Great Chair Negotiation of '78.\\
12 - Although,
that doesn't apply to me.\\
13 - Due to the
If You Sit in My Chair,\\
14 - I'll Kick You in
the Nad's amendment.\\
15 - Here, you can have it,
I don't mind.\\
16 - You'll live another day.\\
17 - Fez, why do you pick on Randy?\\
18 - Based on his hair and his looks,\\
19 - I think he is
a really good person.\\
20 - I just don't like people who
aren't from here, that's all.\\
21 - You know I was thinking we
could get out of here anyway.\\
22 - Maybe go somewhere,
have some fun?\\
23 - Why are you trying
to ruin our Saturday?\\
24 - Come on, let's go
down to Fatso Burger,\\
25 - and get some burgers and fries.\\
26 - Teenagers love
burgers and fries!\\
27 - Nah, no thanks.\\
28 - What if I said I'm buying?\\
29 - Randy, on behalf of all of us,
I would just like to say...\\
30 - I can smell the oniony thanks
all the way over here.\\
31 - Listen, Randy,\\
32 - just because I ate three
hamburgers, doesn't mean I like you.\\
33 - It just means
I have no self-control.\\
34 - Look at that disgusting clown.\\
35 - It's totally freaking me out.\\
36 - You're scared of Fatso?\\
37 - But he's the friendly
neighborhood clown,\\
38 - who gives grade D beef
to all the boys and girls.\\
39 - Look, I just don't like the
way his eyes follow me around.\\
40 - It's the same reason I hate art.\\
41 - What have I told you kids?
What have I told you?\\
42 - Don't pee on the bathroom key?\\
43 - One ketchup bottle per table.
One ketchup per table!\\
44 - Why do you say everything twice?\\
45 - Shut up. Shut up!\\
46 - I hate that guy. He acts
like he owns the place.\\
47 - Well, he does own the place.\\
48 - Well, he acts like it.\\
49 - Hey, he's just a small businessman
trying to make ends meet.\\
50 - Let's ruin him.\\
51 - I've got it! Let's throw a
bunch of pickles at his window!\\
52 - Then, he'll become a prisoner
of his own pickle-prison.\\
53 - Or we could steal
Fatso the Clown.\\
54 - Steal Fatso the Clown,
all right, man!\\
55 - Yeah, Randy!\\
56 - No, boo, Randy! Yeah, Fez!\\
57 - Pickle attack, let's do it!\\
58 - Where did it go?\\
59 - Okay, I have a better idea.\\
60 - Let's steal that clown!\\
61 - Hanging out\\
62 - Down the street\\
63 - The same old thing\\
64 - We did last week\\
65 - Not a thing to do\\
66 - But talk to you\\
67 - We're all all right\\
68 - We're all all right\\
69 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
70 - We're stealing a clown.\\
71 - God, being bad is so exciting!\\
72 - My palms are sweaty.\\
73 - When I was with Eric, the only
times my palms were sweaty,\\
74 - was when I was
holding his sweaty palms.\\
75 - Well I don't want anything to
do with that red-nosed freak.\\
76 - Why are you so afraid of clowns?\\
77 - It was my
seventh birthday party,\\
78 - this clown asked me if I
wanted to smell his pretty flower.\\
79 - And when I did, it squirted
water all over my face.\\
80 - And then he offered
me his handkerchief,\\
81 - when I pulled it
out of his pocket,\\
82 - it just kept coming,
coming, coming.\\
83 - And that's why you hate clowns?\\
84 - No, later I walked in on him,
making out with my mom.\\
85 - Pie-throwing bastard!\\
86 - Okay, wire cutters, a crescent
wrench and a bolt cutter.\\
87 - What about an ax?\\
88 - Do we need an ax?\\
89 - No, I think we're good.\\
90 - But if we decide to go on a killing
rampage at a sleep-away camp,\\
91 - I'll call you.\\
92 - Okay, smart guy, I've thought
of something you haven't.\\
93 - We need a getaway-car.\\
94 - See, your plan is unravelling.\\
95 - I thought we could take
that station wagon right there.\\
96 - Damn, your plan has re-ravelled.\\
97 - But wait, Red
has the keys! Aha!\\
98 - Your plan is unravelling again.\\
99 - We don't need the keys!
I'll hotwire that son of a bitch!\\
100 - What's the big deal? I'll just
ask Red if I can borrow the car.\\
101 - While you're at it,
why don't you ask Red\\
102 - if your ass can borrow his foot?\\
103 - No, I
think I'll just ask for the car.\\
104 - I'll ask Red. I have a lot
of experience with him.\\
105 - He loves me because I used
to have sex with his daughter.\\
106 - Okay, Randy, watch and learn.\\
107 - Hey, Red, reading the paper,
that good old paper?\\
108 - Get out.
Okay, the plan is off.\\
109 - Hey, Mr. Forman, I thought maybe
you could lend us the Vista Cruiser?\\
110 - Well, that's interesting, Kitty.\\
111 - I don't see anything in here
about hell freezing over.\\
112 - It's just, I wanted to build a
wheelchair ramp for my grandmother,\\
113 - and I wanted to buy some lumber.\\
114 - Come on, Red!\\
115 - Just picture his
poor old grandmother,\\
116 - going down the stairs
in a wheelchair,\\
117 - bouncing all over the place.\\
118 - Oh, I don't mean to laugh.\\
119 - Red, she needs his help.\\
120 - Oh, fine.\\
121 - But fill up the tank,
bring it back by tomorrow,\\
122 - and do something
with that hair. Jeez!\\
123 - A wheelchair ramp?
What a load of crap.\\
124 - Fez, my grandmother is in
a wheelchair. She had polio.\\
125 - Well, everything
works out perfect for you.\\
126 - I can't believe I'm
an accessory to a crime.\\
127 - We could get caught,
I could get arrested!\\
128 - I could go to a girl-prison,
this freaking rocks!\\
129 - I remember my first crime.
Grand theft tricycle.\\
130 - I did three days in
the crib for that job.\\
131 - There is a car coming!
Scatter!\\
132 - Oh, no!
I didn't scatter!\\
133 - What's cooking, Fatso?\\
134 - Welcome to Fatso Burger.\\
135 - I'll have a big Fatso combo
with extra secret sauce.\\
136 - Would you like
apple pie with that?\\
137 - Sure!\\
138 - And the extra large soda
for 10 cents more?\\
139 - Okay.\\
140 - Oh, and onion rings
are free with all that.\\
141 - I'll take them.\\
142 - So let me read that back.\\
143 - One big Fatso
combo with extra sauce,\\
144 - an apple pie, extra large
soda and one onion rings.\\
145 - You got it.\\
146 - Sorry, we're closed.\\
147 - What? Then why did
you take my order?\\
148 - Thank you, please drive away.\\
149 - But I'm hungry!\\
150 - Then go get a pizza!\\
151 - I had pizza for lunch!\\
152 - Well, whose fault is that?\\
153 - Go to hell, Fatso!\\
154 - See you there, lard ass!\\
155 - That was awesome!\\
156 - Bob just got into a fight
with a ceramic clown!\\
157 - Believe it or not,
it wasn't the first time.\\
158 - Okay, Fatso,
you're coming with us.\\
159 - And if you try to fight back, well,
that'll scare the living crap out of us.\\
160 - Okay, you guys, after
this, we should steal a car!\\
161 - No! A kid!\\
162 - Donna, that's kidnapping.\\
163 - Okay fine, a dog!
Just something alive!\\
164 - Now don't drink too much, Fatso,\\
165 - you've got to drive your 30
friends home, later, in your tiny car.\\
166 - You guys, stealing this clown\\
167 - was an immature act
of revenge and vandalism.\\
168 - Ooh! Let's draw
boobs on him!\\
169 - So you guys...\\
170 - What the hell is
that doing here?\\
171 - We stole Fatso the Clown!\\
172 - And now we're gonna...\\
173 - What do we do
with a stolen clown?\\
174 - This is what we do
with a stolen clown.\\
175 - Actually, this is what we do
without a stolen clown.\\
176 - It always comes back to this.\\
177 - Thanks for bringing
me here, you guys!\\
178 - So, Fatso, now that you're free,\\
179 - is there anything
we can do for you?\\
180 - Yeah, find me
a really trashy clown-hooker\\
181 - with nice, long legs
and a pair of double-D...\\
182 - Yeah, I found
this in the garage.\\
183 - Oh, Randy,
you think you are so funny.\\
184 - That was funny.\\
185 - Look at that freaky-ass clown.\\
186 - It's just staring at me,
he doesn't even blink.\\
187 - It's because he likes you.
He loves you.\\
188 - He wants to marry you
and then kill you!\\
189 - You guys, something
terrible happened.\\
190 - Fatso the Clown was stolen!\\
191 - What? But he was
a Wisconsin landmark.\\
192 - He's been sitting on that bun
since I was a little girl!\\
193 - I feel so guilty. I was
the last one to talk to him.\\
194 - We had an awful fight.\\
195 - What are you crying about?\\
196 - It was a speaker
with a face on it.\\
197 - Oh, he was more than that!\\
198 - He was a part of our history.\\
199 - I got a lot of warm memories
about that place, too.\\
200 - I knocked up Midgy
in the parking lot.\\
201 - Don't you remember, Red?\\
202 - When we were dating,
we used to go\\
203 - to Fatso Burger
every Friday night,\\
204 - and just dream about our future.\\
205 - I thought we were
just eating burgers.\\
206 - Women are always
doing something else!\\
207 - That's true.\\
208 - Midgy was drinking a shake
when I knocked her up.\\
209 - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!\\
210 - Paper again, Fatso? I win.\\
211 - Okay, let me try.\\
212 - Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!\\
213 - Yeah! We both did paper!\\
214 - Congratulations, Fez.
You tied a ceramic clown.\\
215 - You guys,
I got to turn on the TV.\\
216 - Donna, no one is in the mood for
one of your muscle-building shows.\\
217 - No, my dad is on the news.\\
218 - The whole town is pissed
about Fatso being stolen.\\
219 - I'll always remember
where I was when\\
220 - I heard the news
that Fatso was stolen.\\
221 - I was reading
the paper in the can.\\
222 - It was the same
way with Kennedy.\\
223 - Whoever stole this,
you didn't just steal a clown,\\
224 - you stole a little
piece of Point Place.\\
225 - And you should be
ashamed of yourselves.\\
226 - I have a message
for you from this man,\\
227 - who is too choked up to speak.\\
228 - We will find you!\\
229 - We will find you!\\
230 - Well, kids, it
looks like you're really in some deep...\\
231 - You're not funny.\\
232 - Why is he so damn funny?\\
233 - I knew we shouldn't
have stolen that clown.\\
234 - If we wanted to get back
at that Fatso Burger guy,\\
235 - we should have just done
what my dad would have done.\\
236 - Hire the Sagito brothers
to torch the place.\\
237 - This is big,
the whole town is upset.\\
238 - Even my grandmother rolled
down there to show her support.\\
239 - What the hell are we gonna do?\\
240 - This is simple,
it's just so freaking simple!\\
241 - All we need to do is
get rid of the body.\\
242 - We need a hacksaw,
a bunch of garbage bags\\
243 - and bathtub filled with acid.\\
244 - Yeah, guys, this is serious.\\
245 - You know what the penalty
for stealing a clown is?\\
246 - The cops line you up,\\
247 - and shoot you with
one of those guns\\
248 - that has a flag
that says "Bang."\\
249 - I've been wanting
to say that all day.\\
250 - What in the world?\\
251 - Okay, Red, before
you kill us one by one,\\
252 - let me just say this,
it was his idea.\\
253 - Nice going.\\
254 - I hate that ugly thing. It's always
smiling when nothing is funny.\\
255 - Yeah, so, you're not angry?\\
256 - What makes you
think I'd be angry?\\
257 - Um, every other experience
we've ever had with you?\\
258 - Well, I think it's hilarious.\\
259 - But Kitty is very upset.\\
260 - Apparently, this thing is some
kind of symbol of our love.\\
261 - Help me toss it in the dumpster.\\
262 - Oh, I'm not touching that thing.\\
263 - Wait, I don't have a grip!\\
264 - What is going on
down there?\\
265 - Hide the clown!\\
266 - I don't want it.
Don't give it to me!\\
267 - Oh, my God!
It's looking at me!\\
268 - Quick, put it in here.\\
269 - What on Earth was
all that yelling?\\
270 - Oh, nothing, we were just watching
The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.\\
271 - And someone came really near
the bubble with a pair of scissors.\\
272 - Well, did you kids hear that some
vandals stole Fatso the Clown?\\
273 - Uh, no, this is
the first we're hearing it.\\
274 - Well, I am
just so upset about this\\
275 - that I need to make
some comfort food.\\
276 - So, oh, I came down here
to get peas for a casserole.\\
277 - No!\\
278 - What?\\
279 - Aren't fresh peas better?\\
280 - Well, don't be silly.\\
281 - Frozen peas are fine.\\
282 - It's not a holiday.\\
283 - Okay, let's see, peas,
breadcrumbs, oh, I forgot the corn.\\
284 - I can't believe you
dismembered Fatso!\\
285 - What is the matter
with you kids?\\
286 - This clown means
something to people.\\
287 - Look how upset Red is!\\
288 - Yes, upset!\\
289 - All of you dumb-ass.\\
290 - Mrs. Forman, I can explain.\\
291 - There is nothing
to do in this town.\\
292 - I am so disappointed in you.\\
293 - Especially after everything
I have done for you.\\
294 - I've opened my home,
I have cooked you meals,\\
295 - I've loved you like
you're my own children.\\
296 - She did that for all of you?\\
297 - Man, you guys are
a bunch of jerks.\\
298 - Now, here's what
you're going to do.\\
299 - You're gonna glue
poor Fatso back together,\\
300 - and you are gonna take
him back to his burger.\\
301 - Right, Red?\\
302 - Yes.\\
303 - Because if you don't...
Furious!\\
304 - Foots in asses!\\
305 - Holy hell, did you see that?\\
306 - I've never seen Red so angry!\\
307 - I can't believe we're
taking the clown back.\\
308 - You know what we
should have done?\\
309 - Smashed it into powder,
mixed it into Fatso burgers,\\
310 - and force-fed it to that redundant
old fart who owns the place.\\
311 - Now that's sick!\\
312 - Oh, my God, Fez,
there is a cop following us.\\
313 - Where?\\
314 - Don't look,
he's pulling up next to us.\\
315 - Hurry, cover that
clown with your body.\\
316 - Make it look like
you're making out with it!\\
317 - No. I don't want to!\\
318 - Kiss it, man,
we can't get caught now.\\
319 - Hey, someone put their
old gum in his mouth!\\
320 - I did that!\\
321 - There is no cop and
you kissed a clown!\\
322 - I can't believe I got to
third base with a clown.\\
323 - Fez, there is
nothing below his waist.\\
324 - I got a hold of something.\\
325 - I used to think
criminals were stupid\\
326 - for returning to
the scene of the crime.\\
327 - But I get it now.
It's all about the rush!\\
328 - You know, now that I've seen
Fatso make out with Fez,\\
329 - he's not so scary anymore.\\
330 - See, you're just a clown.\\
331 - A clown who wants to kill you!\\
332 - So there it is.\\
333 - The clown's back, everyone is
happy, none of us went to jail.\\
334 - What a waste of time.\\
335 - Well, Randy, it looks
like I've saved the day.\\
336 - Fatso is back on his bun.\\
337 - So all the bolts
are nice and tight?\\
338 - Yes, of course.
I used a catchy little\\
339 - jingle, righty loosey,
lefty tighty.\\
340 - That clown ain't going nowhere.\\
341 - Shotgun!\\
342 - I'm keeping the nose!\\
343 - Ketchup?
\subsection {Episode 08: Good Company}
1 - Well, Miss Kitty, thank you so
much for having lunch with me.\\
2 - Well, I am always up for a salad\\
3 - and a martini in
the middle of the day.\\
4 - You didn't have a salad.\\
5 - Well, olives and
onions are almost a salad.\\
6 - Well, I'm just glad I can come
to you with all my problems.\\
7 - Well, sure you can, Fez. You
can talk to me about anything.\\
8 - Just to double-check,
are you sure it's normal\\
9 - for one of them to hang
lower than the other?\\
10 - Well, of course, Fez!\\
11 - Nobody's ears are
perfectly symmetrical.\\
12 - Kitty Forman?\\
13 - Marsha Sullivan!\\
14 - How are you? And how
is that husband of yours?\\
15 - Great.
He lost 3,000 pounds,\\
16 - when I took his
Mercedes in the divorce.\\
17 - Oh, newly divorced,
what a shame.\\
18 - And they say
fourth time's a charm.\\
19 - Well, you know what,
you should come over.\\
20 - It sounds like we have
a lot of catching up to do.\\
21 - I'd love that!
I'll bring a bottle of wine.\\
22 - Oh, well, that is terrific!\\
23 - I can't wait to see you!\\
24 - Slut.
Tight-ass.\\
25 - Ah, Mrs. Sullivan, hello!\\
26 - What can these magic hands
do for you today?\\
27 - Actually, I was thinking
of trying something new.\\
28 - Well, perhaps we
should rinse and repeat.\\
29 - Hanging out\\
30 - Down the street\\
31 - The same old thing\\
32 - We did last week\\
33 - Not a thing to do\\
34 - But talk to you\\
35 - We're all all right\\
36 - We're all all right\\
37 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
38 - Donna, this is gonna be your first
birthday since breaking up with Eric.\\
39 - You know what that means,
no crappy gifts\\
40 - to return to
the science-fiction store.\\
41 - Yeah, I mean, I guess
it'll be kind of a relief\\
42 - not to have to give him
his birthday spanking.\\
43 - He made you spank
him on your birthday?\\
44 - Yeah, and then he danced
around in his underwear going,\\
45 - "Happy birthday to me!"\\
46 - Sorry to keep you from work.\\
47 - Oh, don't worry, I already called
in and said I was having sex.\\
48 - Oh. Hello.\\
49 - Oh, my God.
Fez just banged an old...\\
50 - ...smobile in
the driveway with his bike.\\
51 - Marsha, I would like you
to meet my friends.\\
52 - Friends, I would
like you to meet\\
53 - the most ferocious
lover on two legs.\\
54 - Which by the way,
was new for me.\\
55 - It's like watching somebody
kiss their grandmother.\\
56 - Ooh, my nana
don't kiss like that!\\
57 - Mrs. Sullivan,
may I ask you something?\\
58 - Was I good?\\
59 - Good enough.\\
60 - Yes!\\
61 - Nice job, Fez. Combine
two of your favorite pastimes.\\
62 - Sex and antiquing.\\
63 - You know, for years older
men have dated younger women.\\
64 - And now it's finally okay for a
younger man to date an older woman.\\
65 - I guess what I'm
trying to say is, gross!\\
66 - Say what you want,
but Mrs. Sullivan is so\\
67 - much more passionate
than girls your age.\\
68 - You kids just lie there.\\
69 - Mrs. Sullivan, she moves,
she shakes, she makes noises.\\
70 - Are you sure she
wasn't having a stroke?\\
71 - Hey, so I was
thinking we could all go in\\
72 - together on
a birthday present for Donna?\\
73 - But I don't know
what to get her.\\
74 - Oh, cool, there's
an echo inside my head!\\
75 - Hello!\\
76 - Balls!\\
77 - Awesome!\\
78 - You know, we could give Donna
make-up, but that would be a waste.\\
79 - Might as well just give
a dog a snow blower.\\
80 - Oh, Kelso did that once.\\
81 - Oh, no, wait.
He gave his snow blower a dog.\\
82 - That was when he was in his
"machines should have pets" phase.\\
83 - Bongos!\\
84 - Ecuador!\\
85 - Is there anybody in there?\\
86 - Oh, my God.
The echo just said yes.\\
87 - You know what?
I think I've had enough.\\
88 - You know, once I caught Donna
using lip liner on her eyebrows.\\
89 - Seriously, it's like being
best friends with Phyllis Diller.\\
90 - How about I get something and
we can all give it to Donna together?\\
91 - Together.\\
92 - Man, I'm not getting the echo.\\
93 - Hello?\\
94 - There it is.\\
95 - Oh, oh, oh! My friend
Marsha Sullivan is here.\\
96 - Your friend?
I thought you hated her.\\
97 - I do!\\
98 - But she has
the juiciest gossip because\\
99 - she is a filthy,
disgusting, piece of...\\
100 - Marsha!\\
101 - Hello, Kitty.
Hello, Red.\\
102 - Here, Kitty, I brought us
some heavenly camomile tea.\\
103 - Oh, yeah. Tea's nice.\\
104 - You said you were
gonna bring wine.\\
105 - She also said, "Till death do us
part." Look how that worked out.\\
106 - Red, don't you have
something to do in the garage?\\
107 - I can go to the garage?\\
108 - So, Marsha.\\
109 - Tell me what is going on in
that adventurous life of yours?\\
110 - Well, actually, Kitty, I have
a wonderful new boyfriend.\\
111 - He's delicious, and quite young.\\
112 - Young? How young?\\
113 - Forty?\\
114 - Younger.\\
115 - Thirty-nine?\\
116 - Younger.\\
117 - Well, for heaven's sake,
Marsha, what's younger then 39?\\
118 - Kitty, I'm not gonna tell you.
I don't want to shock you.\\
119 - Nineteen.\\
120 - Well, I just don't believe
this. I have a son who is 19.\\
121 - Oh, that's right.
I forgot about Eric.\\
122 - Where is that handsome
son of yours these days?\\
123 - Oh. Don't you
even think about it.\\
124 - He is in Africa, with the
lions, where he's safe.\\
125 - Well, he's gotta
come back sometime.\\
126 - Touch him and I'll
kill you in your sleep.\\
127 - Oh.\\
128 - Well, another day, another
romp with Mrs. Sullivan.\\
129 - Actually, it was three romps,
but who's counting?\\
130 - It was four.\\
131 - Hey, guys, I got
Donna's birthday present.\\
132 - It's a little
wrinkled and musty,\\
133 - but so is Fez's girlfriend
and he seems to like her.\\
134 - "My parents went
to Lake Michigan\\
135 - "and all I got was
this lousy T-shirt."\\
136 - I can relate, too.\\
137 - My mom once went to Lake
Michigan. All I got was a half-brother.\\
138 - T-shirt?
What a lousy present.\\
139 - It even says so,
right on the present.\\
140 - Hey, if you guys
don't like the present,\\
141 - you can steal her
something better.\\
142 - Okay, well, what kind of
stuff is Donna into anyway?\\
143 - I don't know. Beef?\\
144 - No, seriously,
Donna is a cool girl.\\
145 - I think we should
get her something cool.\\
146 - Why, because you wanna
have sex with her?\\
147 - No, I'd do the same thing
for you if it were your birthday.\\
148 - Oh, so you want to
have sex with me?\\
149 - Yeah, Fez,
I want to have sex with you.\\
150 - I'd rather have a sweater.\\
151 - And it's August fourth.\\
152 - If you can't find any
gift ideas for Donna\\
153 - in here,
just give her what I do,\\
154 - coupons for
15 minutes of Bob-time.\\
155 - You know, I always forget
how big Donna's room is.\\
156 - It looks much smaller from
the tree across the street.\\
157 - Hey, look at this! Donna
uses the same hairspray as...\\
158 - My sister.\\
159 - Oh, look at this.
Donna's diary.\\
160 - Oh, I haven't looked
in here in like a month.\\
161 - Aw, damn, it's locked.\\
162 - The key's in one
of the desk drawers.\\
163 - I'm not sure which. There's
always a branch blocking my view.\\
164 - Okay, I'm heading out,
but I think I know\\
165 - what Donna needs
for her birthday.\\
166 - Thicker curtains and
a restraining order.\\
167 - Oh, my God, Fez,
listen to what Donna wrote.\\
168 - It's from a few weeks ago.\\
169 - "Hyde hired this new guy Randy at
the record store, and he's really cute."\\
170 - Donna thinks Randy is cute!
Can you believe this?\\
171 - Jackie, you shouldn't
be reading that.\\
172 - It's a complete
invasion of privacy.\\
173 - Oh, if I get just the
right angle on this mirror,\\
174 - I can see Donna when she sleeps.\\
175 - Here, Donna, I made you
a coupon for your birthday.\\
176 - "Good for one knock-knock
joke, no 'who's there' required."\\
177 - Wow, dreams can come true.\\
178 - See that, Red?
Kids love those.\\
179 - You should have
made them for Eric.\\
180 - Yeah, I suppose I
could have given him a\\
181 - "get my foot out of
your ass free" card.\\
182 - Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you a sinfully sweet confection\\
183 - and she is carrying a cake, too.\\
184 - Oh, my goodness, stop it.\\
185 - Wow, Randy, look at your shirt.\\
186 - Uh, Donna, how would
you describe Randy's shirt?\\
187 - Um...\\
188 - Well buttoned?\\
189 - Cute. You would
say it's cute.\\
190 - I'm sorry, the answer we
were looking for was "adorable."\\
191 - Marsha!\\
192 - Oh, there's my lady.\\
193 - What in the world?\\
194 - Oh, you didn't know?\\
195 - Yeah, Fez is dating
an older lady.\\
196 - Apparently, you taking him to all
those PTA meetings really paid off.\\
197 - Fez is your younger man?
My Fez?\\
198 - Isn't he gorgeous?\\
199 - I think I'll keep him
for a couple of months.\\
200 - Did you hear that?
I'm booked till March.\\
201 - Fez, you can't date her.
Why not?\\
202 - Well, in the first place,
she's so old.\\
203 - Isn't she kind of the
same age as Mrs. Forman?\\
204 - Yeah, say that louder,
that'll really help.\\
205 - How dare you dig your dirty
claws into this innocent boy?\\
206 - Wow, it's almost like she
was right in the room with us.\\
207 - Fez, this is an atrocity.\\
208 - You two have to stop
seeing each other right now.\\
209 - You can't tell me what to
do, you're not my mother.\\
210 - You know what? Fine!\\
211 - Then you just... You do
whatever the hell you want!\\
212 - Marsha!
It's me, Bob Pinciotti.\\
213 - I asked you out last month. I thought
you were moving to Costa Rica.\\
214 - Kitty?\\
215 - Oh, no!\\
216 - What's wrong?
Ice, margarita mix,\\
217 - the top from
a bottle of tequila.\\
218 - Good lord, she took the blender!\\
219 - She's in the dining room.\\
220 - I'll be in the garage.
Save yourselves!\\
221 - I can't believe Fez was seduced
by that cradle-robbing slut.\\
222 - You girls throw it around
like football players,\\
223 - couldn't one of you
have slept with him?\\
224 - Mrs. Forman, you need
to understand something.\\
225 - Fez is a deviant weirdo.\\
226 - We're just glad he is
doing it with a person\\
227 - and not a couch,
a tree or my pillow.\\
228 - After all I have done
for that boy, he has\\
229 - the nerve to say,
"You're not my mother."\\
230 - If that's even what he said.
Because who can understand anything\\
231 - that comes out of that
ungrateful mush-mouth.\\
232 - Wow. Fez and
an older divorced woman.\\
233 - You know, if I were
a divorced older woman,\\
234 - I would take everything
from my ex-husband.\\
235 - Suffer, you cheating bastard!\\
236 - Can't
wait to be divorced.\\
237 - Well, if he doesn't want me
mothering him, fine, I'm done.\\
238 - Next Christmas,
his stocking will not\\
239 - be hung by
the chimney with care.\\
240 - It will be tossed in
the garbage with hair!\\
241 - This place uses too much ice.\\
242 - Here you go, Donna.
Happy birthday.\\
243 - I was gonna put a ribbon around
it, but you know, I barely care.\\
244 - Wow, Hyde, thanks!\\
245 - I have the same shirt from the
other lakes, but I needed this one.\\
246 - Wait. You collect these shirts?
Steven, how did you know that?\\
247 - Oh, because one time I heard
Donna say, "I collect these shirts."\\
248 - I like when Donna wears
shirts with writing on them.\\
249 - The words just pop out at you.\\
250 - Donna, for your birthday,
I'm taking you on a journey.\\
251 - "Where," you ask?
To a Journey concert!\\
252 - "Why," you ask? 'Cause I saw you
had a poster of them in your room.\\
253 - "What was I doing in
your room," you ask?\\
254 - Hey, stop asking questions,
we're going to see Journey!\\
255 - Wow, thanks!\\
256 - Donna, I'm sorry I
didn't get you a present.\\
257 - I was gonna go shopping,
but Mrs. Sullivan\\
258 - is not gonna be around forever.\\
259 - I got to make
every moment count.\\
260 - Yeah, Fez, about that.\\
261 - We just talked to Mrs. Forman
and we learnt a couple of things.\\
262 - First of all, you get
a few margaritas in her\\
263 - and she's a fairly
decent tap dancer.\\
264 - And also, she is really
upset about what you said.\\
265 - Yeah, Fez, she thinks
of you like a son.\\
266 - I mean,
you know, think about it.\\
267 - You know, Miss Kitty
has done a lot for me.\\
268 - Maybe I should go talk to her.\\
269 - And on the way I'll pick
up a box of chocolates.\\
270 - Good. Yeah, Fez, I
think she'd really like that.\\
271 - Oh, then I'll
pick her up one, too.\\
272 - Happy birthday!
I got you a diary.\\
273 - Well, I noticed
you needed a new one\\
274 - when I was reading your old one.\\
275 - You read my diary?\\
276 - I didn't say that.
You just said that.\\
277 - Oh, you don't know what I said.\\
278 - But, I also noticed
you think Randy is cute.\\
279 - What? I do not, that was just
something I wrote, I barely meant it.\\
280 - Oh? Uh-huh? Really? Then why
are you going to the concert with him?\\
281 - You don't even like Journey!\\
282 - I love Journey.\\
283 - They're the Beatles
of our generation.\\
284 - Oh, come on!
Who are you kidding?\\
285 - The only reason you
put up that poster\\
286 - is to cover the hole Fez was
using to spy on you in the shower.\\
287 - Okay. Fine.
I think Randy is cute.\\
288 - But it's not a big deal.
Because...\\
289 - I have to go. Write it in your
diary, I'll read it tomorrow.\\
290 - Miss Kitty?\\
291 - Oh, hi, Fez.\\
292 - I'd get up,
but my back's still sore\\
293 - from that knife you stuck in it.\\
294 - Listen, Tutankhamen,\\
295 - you need to fix this.\\
296 - My wife has been sitting
there calm and quiet all day.\\
297 - I disarmed landmines in Korea.\\
298 - But I have never
been this nervous\\
299 - that something's
about to explode.\\
300 - Miss Kitty?\\
301 - I would like to apologize for
saying that you were not my mother.\\
302 - Why? It's the truth. Why don't
you just tell me I'm fat, too.\\
303 - See, you treated me like a
son, and I didn't mean to hurt you.\\
304 - So, if it will fix things,\\
305 - I would like to take your advice
and stop seeing Mrs. Sullivan.\\
306 - Okay, look, Fez.
It's your life.\\
307 - You can do
whatever you want to do.\\
308 - See, but the problem is, that on
the one hand I want your approval\\
309 - and on the other I
want to be with women\\
310 - in ways that frankly
would turn your stomach.\\
311 - Okay. Okay, Fez.\\
312 - If you really see
me as your mother,\\
313 - then you need to do what any
good son would do in this situation.\\
314 - Lie to me.\\
315 - What do you mean?
Okay, well.\\
316 - When Eric was still here, every
Friday night he would tell me\\
317 - he's going out with his
friends to the movies.\\
318 - But we weren't at the movies,
we were drinking beer\\
319 - and peeing from
the top of the...\\
320 - Oh...\\
321 - So, you see?\\
322 - Not telling each other
what they don't want to hear\\
323 - is what being
a family is all about.\\
324 - Thank you, Miss Kitty.\\
325 - Now if you'll excuse me,\\
326 - I'm going to not have sex with Mrs.
Sullivan on her washing machine.\\
327 - You have fun at the movies!\\
328 - Hey, Dad. I was thinking of cashing
in one of my birthday coupons.\\
329 - I'll take you up on one
free game of Bobopoly.\\
330 - Listen, Donna, I know
those are just for laughs\\
331 - but I wanted to get you
something serious, too. So here.\\
332 - Peanut brittle, huh? Boy,
I sure do love this stuff.\\
333 - You didn't even see it coming!\\
334 - Yep, just like last year!
\subsection {Episode 09: Who Needs You}
1 - No, I get the top drawer.\\
2 - I've always had the top drawer
and this conversation is over.\\
3 - Don't you walk away from me.\\
4 - I'll walk wherever I want!\\
5 - Oh, look, I'm going
to walk on the couch.\\
6 - Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna
drink the rest of your last beer.\\
7 - I win. I put out
a cigarette in there.\\
8 - Ew!\\
9 - What is going on with you
and your stripper wife?\\
10 - You guys are fighting
like cats and whores.\\
11 - Yep. The honeymoon is over.\\
12 - You know,\\
13 - once the thrill of being
married to a stripper is gone,\\
14 - you're just left with a wife who's
always got change for a five.\\
15 - You guys, the radio station
asked me to host\\
16 - an on-air fundraiser
for the Children's Library.\\
17 - A year ago,
I was doing the Farm Report\\
18 - and now it's gonna
be Hot Donna all day long.\\
19 - That's right. I'm gonna be referring to
myself in the third person from now on.\\
20 - Wait. You're not doing
the Farm Report anymore?\\
21 - Well, how am I supposed to
know if my corns are going to grow?\\
22 - And I told my boss\\
23 - that I'm not getting off the
air until I've raised 500 bucks.\\
24 - Which'll be easy, because
my fans do anything I say.\\
25 - Like, there was this one time where
I told everybody to get up and dance\\
26 - when I played
Tear The Roof Off The Sucker.\\
27 - There was almost
a riot at the prison.\\
28 - Yeah. Thanks a lot, Donna. My
dad had to hide under his bunk.\\
29 - Hyde, thanks for letting
us broadcast from Grooves.\\
30 - We couldn't do it at
the Children's Library,\\
31 - because the last
time I was there,\\
32 - this 10-year-old boy got a peek down
my shirt and his mom had to read him\\
33 - What's Happening to My Body?
Three years earlier than she planned.\\
34 - And, well,
now I'm not welcome back.\\
35 - Wait a second, you guys
are doing this at my store?\\
36 - Where was I when
this was decided?\\
37 - At work. We just
didn't want to wake you.\\
38 - I cleared all your crap off the
bed. Why the hell did you do that?\\
39 - Because we're gonna
use it to make up.\\
40 - Unless you want to make up
in the shower.\\
41 - Honeymoon's back on.\\
42 - Oh. It's you.\\
43 - Fenton.\\
44 - During business hours you may address
me by my official title, "Landlord."\\
45 - I'll also respond
to "Lord Fenton."\\
46 - Ooh, or on Sundays,
"The Good Lord."\\
47 - Yes.\\
48 - Fenton, I am in no
mood to talk to you.\\
49 - Oh, well, then just listen.\\
50 - I did a little shuffle-y-doo
with the parking assignments.\\
51 - Your new space is Z.\\
52 - Z? Z's the last spot.\\
53 - It's dangerous to
walk from there at night.\\
54 - I'm a single man.\\
55 - Well, maybe you should put
some effort into your appearance.\\
56 - Maybe you should put some effort
into minding your own business!\\
57 - Maybe you should shut up!
Maybe you should go to hell!\\
58 - I'll go to hell
when you shut up!\\
59 - Damn. I really should have
turned in the direction of my door.\\
60 - Excuse me.
Of course.\\
61 - Hey Fezzie! How's the salon?\\
62 - Horrible. An old lady and a
Marine came in at the same time.\\
63 - I got confused.\\
64 - And, well, Mrs. Riley was not
happy when I shaved her head.\\
65 - Yeah, I know.
I had a tough day too.\\
66 - General Hospital is pre-empted
by some stupid hostage crisis.\\
67 - Did you drink my
last grape soda?\\
68 - Yeah.\\
69 - I left the empty bottle in the
fridge, so you'd know to buy more.\\
70 - But I'd been looking forward
to this grape soda all day.\\
71 - I even made up a song.\\
72 - I'm looking forward
to that grape soda, yeah\\
73 - Jackie, I took you in
when you had nowhere to go,\\
74 - but you've been a total mooch.\\
75 - You have no job,
you pay no rent.\\
76 - You need to shape up or put out.\\
77 - Uh, Fez,
it's shape up or ship out.\\
78 - Then what the hell
is in it for me?\\
79 - Hanging out\\
80 - Down the street\\
81 - The same old thing\\
82 - We did last week\\
83 - Not a thing to do\\
84 - But talk to you\\
85 - We're all all right\\
86 - We're all all right\\
87 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
88 - You know I hate it
when you read the paper\\
89 - while I'm sitting
right here next to you!\\
90 - Yeah. That's why I'm
doing it, honey-bunch.\\
91 - Why don't you
read your horoscope?\\
92 - I bet it says,
"You won't be getting any!"\\
93 - Oh, here is my horoscope. "You'll
find yourself living with a bitch!"\\
94 - You know why they're fighting?\\
95 - Because they're packed into
Steven's tiny room like sardines.\\
96 - And that's no way to be.\\
97 - Unless you are a sardine and
then you've got bigger problems.\\
98 - I think I see where you're
going with this, Kitty.\\
99 - You kick them out
and I'll change the locks.\\
100 - No. They should move into
Laurie's old room. It's just sitting there.\\
101 - Kitty, "It's just sitting there"
is a reason to shoot a deer,\\
102 - not a reason
to move two kids in next door.\\
103 - Oh, you're just upset
because you don't want people\\
104 - seeing you in your big,
green, fuzzy slippers.\\
105 - Those are my Green
Bay Packers slippers.\\
106 - And they looked a lot sharper
in the catalog.\\
107 - Okay, Hot Donna fans.\\
108 - I'm here at Grooves Records raising
money for the Children's Library.\\
109 - And I am not getting off
the air until my jug is full.\\
110 - We have our first donation.
Sir, how much did you give us?\\
111 - Uh, 68 cents.\\
112 - All right. And how did you
come into that kind of cash?\\
113 - I bought something
that cost 32 cents.\\
114 - Terrific.
Hey, here's a fun fact.\\
115 - Money is covered in germs and
human waste, so give it to me.\\
116 - Hop in your cars, your
trucks, your speed wagons\\
117 - and come on down to Grooves.\\
118 - Speaking of speed wagons,
here is a new song from The Cars.\\
119 - Hey, after this song, do you think
I can do one of my characters?\\
120 - I do a really great British
boy trapped in an elevator.\\
121 - Please, sir, I'm stuck in the
lift and I 'ave to use the loo.\\
122 - Okay, it's been two hours
and I'm nowhere near my goal.\\
123 - Um, I understand
that some of my fans\\
124 - can't make it here because,
well, you're in prison.\\
125 - But for those of you who
aren't, rob a bank or something.\\
126 - Just kidding.\\
127 - WFPP in no way endorses
the robbing of banks.\\
128 - I think what you're doing
here is great, man.\\
129 - Thanks, Leo.\\
130 - Yeah, we haven't had
a trash can here in ages.\\
131 - Oh, yeah, Fenton? Well,
if I could do that to myself,\\
132 - I wouldn't be standing here
arguing with you!\\
133 - Wow! This place is spotless.\\
134 - I can see my reflection.
Why, hello, Robert Redford.\\
135 - Well, Fez, I realized
what you said was true.\\
136 - That I needed to help out.
So I cleaned.\\
137 - I guess all the years of watching
my maid scrub the floor really paid off.\\
138 - Well, thank you, Jackie.
You deserve a big night out.\\
139 - I'm taking you to
The Muppet Movie.\\
140 - No thanks, Fez.\\
141 - I'm actually running the bath and I'm going
to spend all night soaking in the tub.\\
142 - Okay, well,
then let's do that then.\\
143 - Alone.\\
144 - Fine. But I'm still
going to the movies.\\
145 - I think Miss Piggy and Kermit
are finally going to do it.\\
146 - Why the hell
did you turn the TV on?\\
147 - To drown out your snoring!\\
148 - I was snoring
to drown out your talking!\\
149 - Okay.\\
150 - I can't put up with those
two fighting anymore.\\
151 - It's like living with
a couple of Italians.\\
152 - Oh, yeah. We moved
two fighting morons\\
153 - into an adjacent room,
and now we can't sleep.\\
154 - Who could have seen this coming?\\
155 - Hot Donna here. Heading
into my 12th hour on the air.\\
156 - Our top news story, I've
raised $38 and my ass is asleep.\\
157 - I guess what I'm
trying to say is,\\
158 - "Where the hell
are all my fans?"\\
159 - Yeah, I know
you're home listening.\\
160 - I've signed enough of your bellies
to know you're not out on dates!\\
161 - You know what? Just forget it.\\
162 - I'll find my own change,
you cheap bastards!\\
163 - Donna, what are you doing? I'm
looking for change, man. Back off.\\
164 - Whoa, I wouldn't stick
your hand in there.\\
165 - Sometimes when Leo doesn't finish
his lunch, he puts it in his pockets.\\
166 - He eats a lot of ravioli.\\
167 - Hey, are you
stealing my raviolis?\\
168 - Okay, listen up, you tightwads.\\
169 - I can't go home till
I've raised 500 bucks.\\
170 - So this is how it's gonna work.\\
171 - Donate a quarter,
I'll take a picture with you.\\
172 - Drop in a dollar,
I'll sign your butt.\\
173 - Anybody who donates 50 bucks, I'll
take off my clothes and show you stuff!\\
174 - Hmm. I never made
that sound before.\\
175 - Jackie!
What? What's going on?\\
176 - You flooded the apartment!\\
177 - What?\\
178 - Oh, I must have fallen asleep
with the tub running.\\
179 - Oh, I bet all
the hot water's gone.\\
180 - It soaked into the carpet
and into the floor.\\
181 - Well, who lives downstairs?\\
182 - Oh. It's you.\\
183 - What do you want?\\
184 - Um, we're just here to
borrow some sugar, neighbor.\\
185 - I don't have any.\\
186 - You don't eat sugar
and keep this figure.\\
187 - Then we'll go. Because
everything here looks ship-shape.\\
188 - Good night then.\\
189 - This is terrible.\\
190 - Your apartment is ruined.
Water is still pouring into mine.\\
191 - I'm gonna have to walk around
in a big, rubber suit.\\
192 - If it still fits!\\
193 - Fenton, I know it looks bad,
but according to the commercial,\\
194 - one roll of Bounty should
take care of everything.\\
195 - You're going to pay for the carpet,
the floor, and my damaged ceiling.\\
196 - How am I supposed to find
that kind of money?\\
197 - Well, you always seem to find money
for those tacky, tight pants you wear.\\
198 - You wish your pants were tight.\\
199 - You wish your pants were loose.\\
200 - Toothpick-legs!
Sausage-thighs!\\
201 - Get out!\\
202 - You. Pack your bags.\\
203 - Fez! That's a great idea!\\
204 - Let's go to Bermuda
while this place dries out.\\
205 - You pushed it too far.
I want you out.\\
206 - Wait, what? Fez,
where am I supposed to go?\\
207 - Oh, how about this?
Why don't you go down to\\
208 - I-Don't-Care Street, make a left
on Get-Out-Of-My-Life Boulevard,\\
209 - and take the express bus
to downtown Suck-It?\\
210 - Samantha, Red and I both felt
we needed to talk to you.\\
211 - Steven, Kitty is
making me talk to you.\\
212 - We're worried
that you two aren't\\
213 - communicating
the way a couple should.\\
214 - We're sick of you
screaming at each other\\
215 - like a couple of dumbasses.\\
216 - Red, what happens
between me and Sam\\
217 - is kind of private.\\
218 - I'll tell you anything.\\
219 - Hyde and I are
like an open book.\\
220 - Oh, Red and I
share everything too,\\
221 - except bars of soap.
It's unsanitary.\\
222 - Well, I gotta
tell Kitty something.\\
223 - You two going to stop fighting?\\
224 - You see the thing is...\\
225 - Fighting gets Hyde and me
all worked up and...\\
226 - After we fight, we...
Well, you know.\\
227 - We get naked and
have hot, crazy sex.\\
228 - Good God, I didn't
need to hear about that!\\
229 - Holy Toledo,
tell me more about that!\\
230 - So you're saying...\\
231 - You put up with the fighting
to spice up your S-E-X?\\
232 - Exactly.\\
233 - You two are naughty.\\
234 - You two are idiots.\\
235 - Fenton,
I'm so glad I caught you.\\
236 - Look, this whole mess
is my fault and not Fez's.\\
237 - I'm the one who ran the bath.
I flooded the place.\\
238 - I ruined your creepy night of
classical music and Indian food.\\
239 - Well, you also ruined this.
My beautiful pig-suede jacket.\\
240 - From China?
Mmm.\\
241 - Oh, it's beautiful.\\
242 - And versatile.\\
243 - You can wear it as
a jacket or a sport coat\\
244 - or you can wrap it
around your waist\\
245 - when you're
having a big-butt day.\\
246 - Fenton, please let me
make this up to you.\\
247 - I know a great place we
can get an even better jacket.\\
248 - It may not be suede
and it may not be from China,\\
249 - but I am neither of those things
and I'm a better person for it.\\
250 - Well, it better be good stuff.\\
251 - Cheap leather makes me rashy
in all the wrong places.\\
252 - What are the right places?\\
253 - I've said too much.\\
254 - Hello, Donna.\\
255 - Santa Claus?\\
256 - Am I having a dream?\\
257 - No, Donna.
This is really happening.\\
258 - What are you doing here?\\
259 - Well, I've come to fill
your jug with change,\\
260 - so that you can
help build that library\\
261 - for all the good
little boys and girls.\\
262 - Wow. Thanks, Santa.\\
263 - And to think everyone
said you weren't real.\\
264 - Who? I'll kill
those little bastards!\\
265 - I... I mean... Who?\\
266 - Donna?\\
267 - Don't kill them, Santa!
Please don't kill them!\\
268 - Donna, calm down.
It's me, Randy.\\
269 - I brought change.\\
270 - My nana, God rest that
sweet woman's soul,\\
271 - gave me this bank
when I was just a boy.\\
272 - She didn't have much,\\
273 - but every time she came over
she told me to close my eyes\\
274 - and she'd drop
a silver dollar in here.\\
275 - I want you to have it.\\
276 - Oh, my God, Randy,
you are so awesome.\\
277 - Pennies?
Thanks a lot, Nana!\\
278 - I guess all your real money
must have gone to Jack Daniel's\\
279 - and slot machines,
you lying old hag!\\
280 - Randy, don't worry about it.\\
281 - I mean, at least you tried.\\
282 - Yeah, well, I'd like to do
what I can to help.\\
283 - Because I care about
the Children's Library.\\
284 - You hear that, Point Place?\\
285 - Randy Pearson loves little boys.\\
286 - Okay, well, Steven and Samantha
are moving back downstairs\\
287 - because they're not
gonna stop fighting.\\
288 - And you know why?\\
289 - Yes, unfortunately, I do.\\
290 - What kind of a person has to
argue in order to... You know.\\
291 - Well, what's wrong with it if
it spices up their lovemaking?\\
292 - Jeez, Kitty, is that what we're
doing? We're just saying it now?\\
293 - Well, you never want to talk
about anything.\\
294 - And you always do.\\
295 - I can't get any peace
unless I leave the room.\\
296 - And even then,
I have to run the lawnmower\\
297 - in the garage in order to not
hear your constant yammering.\\
298 - Red Forman!
Speechless, huh?\\
299 - Well, it's about damn time.\\
300 - I thought we were trying this...\\
301 - Oh!\\
302 - Jackie... Oh! Jackie, I had
such a great time with you.\\
303 - I got a new jacket,
a manicure, crepes.\\
304 - I didn't know a woman
could be so into that stuff.\\
305 - I know. Fenton, I had such
a great time with you too.\\
306 - Well! If it isn't Jackie.\\
307 - There's only one person I hate
more than Jackie, and that is Fenton.\\
308 - And Fenton, there's only one
person I hate more than you.\\
309 - Queen Elizabeth.\\
310 - Who does she think she is?
Queen of England?\\
311 - Well, don't worry, Fez,
'cause I'm leaving tonight.\\
312 - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\\
313 - You're leaving?
Yeah, she's leaving.\\
314 - She destroyed my apartment.
She's costing me a fortune.\\
315 - Jackie I... I can't
let you go. I mean,\\
316 - you have the other half of my
"best friends forever" heart charm!\\
317 - Well, Fenton, I'd love to stay.\\
318 - But as all good
friendships require,\\
319 - you're going to have to do
something for me.\\
320 - Forgive Fez and not charge
him for any of the damages.\\
321 - Well, Jackie, you're
putting me in quite a bind.\\
322 - And not in a good way.\\
323 - Unfortunately, I don't
respond to threats, so...\\
324 - Okay. See you.
Don't go!\\
325 - Fine. He's off the hook.\\
326 - Yeah?\\
327 - Fez? Come on, what do you say?
Can I still be your roommate?\\
328 - Fine.\\
329 - But if she's staying,
I want a better parking space.\\
330 - You can have S.
A!\\
331 - S! S!
B! C!\\
332 - Why don't you park on the
roof and pay me $3,000?\\
333 - Is S still available?\\
334 - Apparently in my
delirium last night,\\
335 - I said a few things on the air
that I shouldn't have said.\\
336 - So I need to apologize to
the following groups of people.\\
337 - The Irish.\\
338 - People who make
their living from boats.\\
339 - Any religion that
values the Old Testament.\\
340 - Glass blowers.\\
341 - Cross-country skiers.
It's not just walking.\\
342 - Um... Quakers.\\
343 - I don't know what you are,
but I love your oatmeal.
\subsection {Episode 10: Sweet Lady}
1 - Hyde, new releases just
arrived at the store.\\
2 - Oh! Is that Abba?\\
3 - Oh, cool!
I love the Talking Heads.\\
4 - They have a girl in
the band and she's like\\
5 - a real musician who doesn't
have to use her sex appeal.\\
6 - Although it wouldn't kill her
to put on some lipstick.\\
7 - Maybe pop a few zits. I mean,
you're on stage for God's sake!\\
8 - My band has a girl in it too and
we totally respect her as a musician.\\
9 - A musician with
really big boobs.\\
10 - Hey, you know what they
should have? An all-girl band.\\
11 - Except instead of
playing instruments,\\
12 - they just dance
around and make out.\\
13 - You know, you and Karen
could totally hit it off.\\
14 - My band and I are heading up to
my parents' cabin this weekend,\\
15 - if you wanna come.\\
16 - Oh, well, my dad
asked me to shave a "G"\\
17 - into his back for
the Packers game.\\
18 - So yes, I would love to come.\\
19 - Ooh, Barry Manilow. All right,
Randy, here's what I want you to do.\\
20 - Take this record,
go back to the store.\\
21 - Anybody looks like a Manilow
fan, chuck it at their head.\\
22 - Even better, I'll
throw it at their crotch.\\
23 - We don't want those
people reproducing.\\
24 - So, Donna. Sounds good.\\
25 - You and Randy in a cabin.
Breathing in the fresh mountain air.\\
26 - Having sex.\\
27 - What are you talking about?\\
28 - Well, you see, when a boy likes
a girl, the boy gets the girl drunk...\\
29 - Hyde.\\
30 - That's not gonna happen.\\
31 - He's not into me like that and he
knows I'm getting over a break-up.\\
32 - Come on, man. Don't
you know how guys think?\\
33 - Not really.\\
34 - The only guy I have
ever been with was Eric,\\
35 - and as far as I know,
a typical guy's thoughts are,\\
36 - "Who would win in a fight?
Bigfoot or Chewbacca?"\\
37 - All right. Here's what
a typical guy thinks about.\\
38 - Sex, beer and pinball.\\
39 - Now, if a guy can have sex while
drinking beer on a pinball machine,\\
40 - well, that's the beautiful
story of how I met my wife.\\
41 - Well, if it isn't Miss Mooch,
my unemployed roommate.\\
42 - What would you
like to mooch today?\\
43 - My cheese puffs?
My Yoo-hoo? My Oil of Olay?\\
44 - Fez, I want to find work,
but it's really hard.\\
45 - I spent all morning going
to every store in the mall.\\
46 - And when I find the right
outfit, I'm gonna look for a job.\\
47 - Fez! I look fantastic!\\
48 - You know, I always give
credit where credit is due.\\
49 - So thank you, God, for
my fantastic bone structure!\\
50 - So, Christine,
what's on the agenda\\
51 - for my favorite
local talk show host?\\
52 - I mean besides
looking Fez-tastic.\\
53 - Well, today I'm off to the zoo.\\
54 - It seems a baby
elephant is being born.\\
55 - And I want to be
the first thing it sees,\\
56 - so it knows there's beauty
in this ugly world.\\
57 - Well, for my money,
nothing beats the time\\
58 - you rode along with cops and
stopped the liquor store hold-up.\\
59 - Well, I got lucky then.\\
60 - The day before's show I
learned to do the flamenco.\\
61 - And as it turns out, a high
dance kick doubles beautifully\\
62 - for a knock-out
blow to the face.\\
63 - Ciao, darling!\\
64 - I love it when
she says, "Ciao."\\
65 - It's like she's made up a
whole new way to say goodbye.\\
66 - Was that
Christine St. George?\\
67 - She's my idol! That's who
I should be working for!\\
68 - We could co-anchor What's
Up Wisconsin together!\\
69 - Oh, I could just picture it!\\
70 - I'm Christine St. George.\\
71 - And I'm Jackie St. Jackie!\\
72 - And it's time to ask,\\
73 - What's Up Wisconsin?
What's Up Wisconsin?\\
74 - Coming up today,
war, famine, disease.\\
75 - But first, our top story. Jackie
St. Jackie is spectacular!\\
76 - And in sports today,
I'm gorgeous!\\
77 - Oh, this just in. Jackie St.
Jackie is the greatest girl ever!\\
78 - I am!\\
79 - I know!\\
80 - Jackie St. Jackie? I got breaking
news. You're freaking nuts!\\
81 - Hanging out\\
82 - Down the street\\
83 - The same old thing\\
84 - We did last week\\
85 - Not a thing to do\\
86 - But talk to you\\
87 - We're all all right\\
88 - We're all all right\\
89 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
90 - Oh, Jackie, you're watching
Christine St. George. I just love her!\\
91 - The other day she had
a tiger cub on her show.\\
92 - It was just the sweetest thing
you ever saw!\\
93 - Right up until it
mauled the weather man.\\
94 - Yeah, but he
probably deserved it.\\
95 - He looks like he
smells like ham.\\
96 - Oh, but you know what?
Christine handled it perfectly.\\
97 - She distracted the tiger with
the food critic's lamb chop\\
98 - and then she made a tourniquet
out of her microphone cord.\\
99 - I know, she's amazing!
Oh, oh, she's back!\\
100 - That sure is one
big pumpkin, Tim!\\
101 - Coming up,
a high school marching band\\
102 - that collectively has lost
more than 400 pounds!\\
103 - You know what? I'm gonna write
Christine a letter and ask her for a job.\\
104 - Oh, no, no, no, no, you have
got to go talk to her in person.\\
105 - Trust me, there is nothing
celebrities like more\\
106 - than people showing
up in their offices.\\
107 - Steven, you have finally
reached that point in your life\\
108 - where you're no
longer a dumb ass kid.\\
109 - You're a dumb ass man.\\
110 - Wow. Those dumb ass
teen years just flew by.\\
111 - And now that you're married, I'm
gonna take you on a rite of passage\\
112 - to the Viking Lodge.\\
113 - Gosh, Red,
I don't know what to say.\\
114 - I guess the first thing
that comes to mind is, uh, no.\\
115 - I stripped at the Viking Lodge in
Vegas for a guy's 85th birthday.\\
116 - He had a heart attack.\\
117 - But then
the paramedics showed up\\
118 - and they were
really good tippers.\\
119 - Come on, Steven!\\
120 - You need a place
where you can hang out\\
121 - and have a beer
with other married men.\\
122 - Boy, does that sound boring.\\
123 - Hanging out in a dingy room,
drinking beer, doing nothing.\\
124 - Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the basement.\\
125 - All right, Red, I guess I'll go.\\
126 - You're not gonna make me wear
one of those silly Viking hats, are you?\\
127 - 'Course not,
don't be ridiculous.\\
128 - Ours have horns and chin straps,\\
129 - and your name stitched
in yarn. It's very classy.\\
130 - Wow! Nice cabin.\\
131 - It's got a cozy, mid-century,
dead carcass feel to it.\\
132 - Yeah, I like to come up here
when I really feel like roughing it.\\
133 - So, you hook up the VCR.
I'll go microwave some nachos.\\
134 - Hey, Donna.\\
135 - Did you have sex with Randy yet?\\
136 - Would you shut up?\\
137 - That is not what this
weekend is about.\\
138 - Oh, yeah, you're right.\\
139 - A guy invites a hot girl to a
private cabin deep in the woods.\\
140 - It can only mean one thing.
He wants you to meet his band!\\
141 - Okay, maybe it's a little
weird that they're not here.\\
142 - A little weird?\\
143 - That's like saying
it's a little crazy\\
144 - that you're talking
to a floating head.\\
145 - Well, we are alone.
He did bring wine.\\
146 - Wait a minute! Maybe you're
right! Maybe he wants to get it on!\\
147 - Did somebody say get it on?\\
148 - Fez, will you get out of here?\\
149 - Yeah, Fez, beat it!\\
150 - Ow! Why you...\\
151 - Son of a bitch!\\
152 - Hi, I'm here to see
Christine St. George.\\
153 - Do you have an appointment?\\
154 - No, but I am her biggest fan and
I would love to be her co-anchor.\\
155 - Okay, have a seat and a
psychiatrist will be right with you.\\
156 - Oh, please, miss, couldn't you
just let us in for two minutes?\\
157 - I got a better idea. How about
if I let you in for no minutes?\\
158 - Please? Please,
could you let us in?\\
159 - I know I have what it
takes to be on TV\\
160 - and I just need to demonstrate
my talents to Christine.\\
161 - Oh, and I just want an
autograph. Or a souvenir.\\
162 - She made cheesecake on
yesterday's show. Is that around?\\
163 - You really want to get in, huh?\\
164 - Okay, I'm thinking of a
number between one and 10.\\
165 - Six.
You got it!\\
166 - Wait. So does that
mean we can go in?\\
167 - No. That's the number of cops
I'm gonna call if you don't beat it.\\
168 - But I'm supposed
to be her co-anchor!\\
169 - And I'm supposed to be
Brooke Shields. Ain't life a bitch?\\
170 - So, Steven, this is the Viking
Lodge. What do you think?\\
171 - I can see why you got that
CPR poster in the hallway.\\
172 - Red!\\
173 - It's great to see you!
Who's the new guy?\\
174 - Murph, Smitty, this is
my friend Steven. Hey.\\
175 - Steven just got married.\\
176 - My condolences.\\
177 - Listen, I've been
married for 40 years\\
178 - and I'm half
the man I used to be.\\
179 - But it evens out. My wife is
twice the woman she used to be.\\
180 - He's saying she's fat.\\
181 - Big woman.\\
182 - You know, pretty soon
your wife will be\\
183 - nagging at you about doing
one chore or another.\\
184 - You know,
taking out the garbage,\\
185 - mowing the lawn.
Making love to her.\\
186 - Wait till she starts finishing
your sentences for you.\\
187 - Or in my case, my pizzas.\\
188 - You know, I used
to think it was cute\\
189 - when my wife
finished my sentences.\\
190 - You know what I want her
to finish now? Living!\\
191 - See, that's
the thing about marriage.\\
192 - No one tells you
about the three rings.\\
193 - There's the engagement ring,
the wedding ring, and the suffering.\\
194 - He's saying she's annoying.\\
195 - Big pain.\\
196 - Is this all you guys do?
Just stand around\\
197 - the bar and complain
about your wives?\\
198 - Of course not!\\
199 - So listen, I'm having
a few drinks the other night,\\
200 - and my old lady says,
"I suppose you like\\
201 - "yourself better
when you're drunk."\\
202 - I says,
"No, I like you better."\\
203 - My wife came to me
the other day and said,\\
204 - "We don't talk anymore." And
I said, "You ruined the streak!"\\
205 - You know, I'm learning a lot
from you guys in here.\\
206 - For instance, bras.
Not just for girls.\\
207 - The steam is great.\\
208 - Time to loosen the towel
and release the hounds.\\
209 - Don't look down.
Don't look down.\\
210 - I saw the hounds!\\
211 - Miss St. George, you
put the beauty in beautiful,\\
212 - the sass in sassy and what
else can I say? I love a big tip!\\
213 - And what else can I say?
I love a big kiss ass!\\
214 - So, who's gonna be
on the show today?\\
215 - Oh, Pete Rose.
I gotta go warm up.\\
216 - I don't want my slider
to hang over the plate.\\
217 - He really took me downtown the
last time, but not today, Pete Rose!\\
218 - Not today!\\
219 - Okay, well, let me get your
hair products. I'll be right back.\\
220 - Okay, darling.\\
221 - Hi, this is
Jackie St. Jackie,\\
222 - reporting live from Fresh Hair.\\
223 - Today's topic, ugly people
running with scissors.\\
224 - Health hazard or
community service?\\
225 - Oh, why, hello,
Christine St. George!\\
226 - Why, hello, crazy girl
talking into a hairbrush!\\
227 - Jackie! Out! Out! Out!\\
228 - I apologize,
Miss St. George.\\
229 - This is Jackie, my roommate.\\
230 - She wants to be your co-anchor
on What's Up Wisconsin.\\
231 - Well, from what I've
seen you do so far,\\
232 - Jackie, I'd say you
have what it takes.\\
233 - Really?
No.\\
234 - But you seem like a dear
thing, so good luck to you. Adios!\\
235 - Adios? How does she even
come up with those?\\
236 - Oh, she forgot her
hair products. Christine!\\
237 - Wait! No, no! Fez! Wait, wait,
let me deliver them to the studio.\\
238 - They'll have to let me in
and I can talk to her.\\
239 - I don't know, Jackie.\\
240 - I'll give you a free peek
at me in the shower.\\
241 - This end is up.\\
242 - Well, it took a while,
but the rugged\\
243 - outdoorsman finally
got the fire going.\\
244 - Lucky for us he was hiking by.\\
245 - Well, Randy.
Here we are.\\
246 - All alone. In front
of a nice roaring fire.\\
247 - This has worked out perfectly.\\
248 - The only thing you forgot
is I'm not a stupid bimbo!\\
249 - What?\\
250 - This whole act may work on
your little groupies, but not me.\\
251 - So find another groupie to
grope, you gross groupie-groper!\\
252 - Donna, how can you say that?\\
253 - I mean, literally, that
sounded really hard to say!\\
254 - This whole night has been
one long set-up to get me alone!\\
255 - "Oops, my friends didn't
make it." What's next?\\
256 - "Oops, I spilled wine on your
blouse. Oops, we're naked!\\
257 - "Oops, I made an ice-cream
sundae on your boobs!"\\
258 - Donna, meet my band.\\
259 - The band is here!\\
260 - Band, meet Donna.
Believe it or not, she's sober.\\
261 - I'll help you guys
unload the van.\\
262 - Um, Randy, I feel
like such a moron.\\
263 - I thought you were
trying to hit on me.\\
264 - Donna, I wouldn't do that.\\
265 - I'm pretty old-fashioned
when it comes to romance.\\
266 - We're talking flowers,
candy, love poems.\\
267 - And, well, you haven't
given me any of those things.\\
268 - I mean, this is gonna
be really hard to say,\\
269 - but I'm sorry that I
called you a groupie...\\
270 - A gross
groupie... I can't even say it.\\
271 - Wait, you two
aren't going to do it?\\
272 - No. You guys were wrong.\\
273 - And since I control you,
I can make you do this!\\
274 - Donna, stop it!\\
275 - Gross, man,
what did you eat for lunch?\\
276 - Christine St. George?
Hi, Jackie Burkhart.\\
277 - Yes, the roving
hairbrush reporter.\\
278 - How did you get past reception?\\
279 - Well, I really
wanted to talk to you,\\
280 - so I asked Fez if I could
deliver your hair products.\\
281 - Oh. Oh! Well,
I'm glad you did.\\
282 - Because now that I see you
standing in a television studio,\\
283 - I think you have
a solid career ahead of you.\\
284 - As a delivery girl.
Can I validate your parking?\\
285 - But Miss St. George, please. If
you would just give me a chance.\\
286 - Look, I know I have
what it takes to be on TV.\\
287 - I own three of them! I also
know everything about you.\\
288 - What you like, what you
don't like. What you wear.\\
289 - Dear, these are skills
I could teach a monkey.\\
290 - And as a matter of fact,
I did. Episode 427.\\
291 - Oh.\\
292 - But here's the good news.
I like you. You've got spirit.\\
293 - No. Moxie, yes.
Wait! No, it's gumption.\\
294 - Oh, there's a word for it
and I can't think what it is.\\
295 - Oh, well.
The point is, look,\\
296 - you have a job if you
want it, as my assistant.\\
297 - Really?
Yes.\\
298 - I'll take it! I have a
job in television! Okay.\\
299 - Oh, wait, wait, do I get to
say What's Up Wisconsin?\\
300 - You can answer the phone
any way you like.\\
301 - Oh, there is my
little Viking in training.\\
302 - So, how was last night?\\
303 - Don't even get me started on
the hounds. Oh! The hounds.\\
304 - The hounds are
an old man's testicles.\\
305 - I don't know how I'm gonna tell
Red, but I don't wanna be a Viking.\\
306 - All those guys do is sit around\\
307 - and complain about their wives.\\
308 - Oh, Steven, no. Those
men were just kidding around.\\
309 - Did Red tell the one about the
three rings? I came up with that.\\
310 - Steven! Bad news about the Viking
Lodge. They don't want you back.\\
311 - All my hopes and dreams
have been unaffected.\\
312 - But you know,
just out of curiosity,\\
313 - why would they not want me back?\\
314 - It was Smitty.\\
315 - He felt that your
eyes were lingering.\\
316 - Oh, Jackie. How is the
first day of work going?\\
317 - Terrific. I can't believe I'm in the
glamorous world of show business,\\
318 - that I have finally arrived!
Oh, here's your coffee.\\
319 - Thank you.\\
320 - I asked for half and half.
This is milk.\\
321 - Right, but I kind of, sort of
thought they were the same thing.\\
322 - No, no, half and half is not
the same thing as milk.\\
323 - They're different.\\
324 - Just as listening to me and
not listening to me are different.\\
325 - Like happy and furious
are different!\\
326 - Like employed and fired are
different. Do we understand each other?\\
327 - Good!\\
328 - Now get me the coffee I want
or I'll get a monkey to do it!\\
329 - Jackie! Psst! Come here!\\
330 - Don't take it so hard, sweetie.\\
331 - Sometimes Christine
flies off the handle like that.\\
332 - But most of the time
she's a real sweetheart.\\
333 - Oh. Really?
No.\\
334 - Welcome to hell!\\
335 - Hey, the name of the show
is What's up Wisconsin.\\
336 - Why is it that every story
you write is about Minneapolis?\\
337 - All right, you know what? You're
fired. Go take a slow boat to China!\\
338 - Maybe I will.
I love boats.\\
339 - Hey, Christine, hey, what do
you think about my new beret?\\
340 - This is what I think about it!
\subsection {Episode 11: Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy}
1 - Ah, Kitty. Making
brownies for breakfast?\\
2 - No. Brownies have too much
sugar to be a healthy breakfast.\\
3 - Here, have some
Fun Time Snack-A-Doodles.\\
4 - Uh, Mrs. Forman, can I borrow
your curling iron?\\
5 - I was gonna borrow Donna's,
but hers smells like potatoes.\\
6 - It wasn't my fault. My dad
used it to make curly fries.\\
7 - Well, I wanna look
good for my first\\
8 - full day of work
at the TV station.\\
9 - I wanna look super pretty,
so that co-workers won't mind\\
10 - when I stab them in the back.\\
11 - You could try my hairstyling
technique. Wake up, remove pillow.\\
12 - You know, I am
just so excited for you,\\
13 - working for TV's
Christine St. George.\\
14 - She is my hero. She's
amazing, she's talented...\\
15 - She's the devil.\\
16 - She seems sweet to me.\\
17 - Last week,
she was having a lot of fun\\
18 - with this dog that
could say, "Christine."\\
19 - It sounded like,
"Wrureen."\\
20 - It was pretty good.\\
21 - Okay. Rumor has it that as
soon as the cameras went off,\\
22 - she had that dog neutered.\\
23 - Well, I just cannot believe
that a woman who makes\\
24 - her own potpourri
could be that bad.\\
25 - Now, if you're
still nervous about her,\\
26 - just do what I did when I
first started at the hospital.\\
27 - Kitty, I don't think she is
allowed to bring Kahlua to work.\\
28 - No, you just... You bring in some
treats and put them on your desk.\\
29 - That's what I did
with my awful boss.\\
30 - Now he loves me,
he weighs 300 pounds\\
31 - and he sweats when
he ties his shoes.\\
32 - I win.\\
33 - Here, take some brownies.\\
34 - Thanks. Well, I guess
it's true what they say.\\
35 - Keep your friends close
and your enemies fat.\\
36 - You know, if you want to
impress them, do a good job.\\
37 - If your job is making coffee,
make coffee.\\
38 - If your job is answering
phones, answer phones.\\
39 - If your job is
sharpening pencils...\\
40 - Get a new job,
'cause that one blows.\\
41 - You know what? At this point, I'll try
anything 'cause Christine is a bitch.\\
42 - You know,
that is a double standard.\\
43 - Why is it okay for a man
to be a hard ass boss\\
44 - but when a woman is,
she's labelled a bitch?\\
45 - Because Christine's a bitch.\\
46 - Good morning, Jackie.\\
47 - How are you enjoying
your time behind the scenes\\
48 - at the fifth largest
TV market in Wisconsin?\\
49 - I don't know. I'm working
pretty hard. Well, good.\\
50 - Oh, here are your messages,
Miss St. George.\\
51 - Great.
And, uh, I also made\\
52 - a new fresh pot of coffee.
Wonderful.\\
53 - And I sharpened
the pencils on your desk.\\
54 - You... Are you
a complete moron?\\
55 - Those pencils were a gift
from Jane Pauley.\\
56 - Well, they still say,
"Love and kisses, Jane Pau."\\
57 - How would you like it if I
ruined something of yours?\\
58 - That was your mug.\\
59 - My Ted Koppel mug!\\
60 - Listen, my job as TV
host is to be happy.\\
61 - And your job is
to keep me happy.\\
62 - You screw up one more time
and you're out of here.\\
63 - Okay, everybody,
let's do a super good show.\\
64 - Hanging out\\
65 - Down the street\\
66 - The same old thing\\
67 - We did last week\\
68 - Not a thing to do\\
69 - But talk to you\\
70 - We're all all right\\
71 - We're all all right\\
72 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
73 - Why is there no orange juice
in my mini-fridge?\\
74 - I'll stock you right now.\\
75 - No, dear.\\
76 - That would be
the answer to the question,\\
77 - "When are you
going to stock it?"\\
78 - My question was,
"Why is it empty?"\\
79 - Um, brownie?\\
80 - I want my orange juice.
I don't want your leftovers.\\
81 - Do I look like
a homeless person to you?\\
82 - Oh, oh! All I wanted you to
do was just to try a brownie.\\
83 - Oh, all right, you big baby.
I'll have one of your brownies.\\
84 - Hmm, this is pretty good.\\
85 - Really?
Mmm-hmm.\\
86 - Well, thank you.\\
87 - All right, well, I also made
up your schedule for tomorrow.\\
88 - Oh, did you? Good.\\
89 - Oh, good job. Oh, yeah.\\
90 - Really?
Mmm-hmm.\\
91 - Great. Okay, well,\\
92 - they canceled your appearance
with the boy who fell down the well.\\
93 - Ah, thank God.\\
94 - Why are we celebrating that?\\
95 - The boy is just clumsy.\\
96 - Listen. I'm sorry
I yelled at you earlier.\\
97 - Oh, you must think
I'm a complete psycho.\\
98 - It was completely my fault.\\
99 - I should have just
moved out of the way\\
100 - when you threw
that script at me.\\
101 - No, no, not at all,
because if you had,\\
102 - the script would have gone
flying right past you\\
103 - and might have hit
somebody important.\\
104 - What are you listening to?\\
105 - Nothing.\\
106 - Hyde is always giving me crap
about my poofy hair,\\
107 - so I use these sweet babies
to hold it down.\\
108 - Oh, my God, look at David Bowie.\\
109 - He's got a nicer ass then I do.\\
110 - Randy, this is
where you disagree.\\
111 - I'd like to Donna, but he's wearing
a dress. You're wearing jeans.\\
112 - I'm very confused.\\
113 - All right. I gotta go to work, but
before I do, I have to do one thing.\\
114 - Ha ha!
Re-poofed your hair.\\
115 - Hey, Randy, can you help
that chick sitting on the couch?\\
116 - Oh, wait. That's you.\\
117 - Guys, who put a sandwich
in the cash register?\\
118 - You can pay for
things with sandwiches?\\
119 - Hello, Hawaii.\\
120 - I did that, Hyde. Sorry, man, but
I've been a little scatterbrained lately.\\
121 - It's true,\\
122 - because I remember
when I first met you,\\
123 - I thought,
"That guy is focused."\\
124 - Yeah. You know, you've been
acting kind of weird even for you.\\
125 - Are you sober?\\
126 - No. Aquarius.\\
127 - So what's wrong?\\
128 - I got a crush on someone, but
I don't know what to do about it.\\
129 - It's been all long time
since I've wooed a lady.\\
130 - First off, nobody uses the
phrase "woo a lady" anymore.\\
131 - That's why the girl
at The Hub slapped me.\\
132 - No, man,
she slapped you because you\\
133 - grabbed her ass and
yelled "Whoo! A lady!"\\
134 - Mrs. Forman,
your brownies saved my life.\\
135 - Christine was
yelling at me all morning,\\
136 - but then I gave her
one of your brownies\\
137 - and then she started liking me.\\
138 - Oh, I don't believe
that for a minute.\\
139 - I could eat a whole tray of those
brownies and I still wouldn't like you.\\
140 - Red, television's
Christine St. George\\
141 - loves my brownies.
This is so exciting.\\
142 - I am in a famous person's
stomach right now.\\
143 - Okay, well, I need some more for
tomorrow, so could you make some?\\
144 - Oh. I just, um... I just put Red's
chicken pot pie in the oven, so...\\
145 - Here, honey.
Eat around the chicken.\\
146 - It's probably
loaded with bacteria.\\
147 - All right, Leo. The problem
that most guys have\\
148 - when they're picking up chicks
is they over think things.\\
149 - So you should be fine.\\
150 - All you have to say to a
lady is, "Come here often?"\\
151 - If she says no, grab her ass.\\
152 - You know she
won't be coming back,\\
153 - so you won't have
to see her again.\\
154 - No. Look, I got an idea.\\
155 - Pretend we're at a bar and
the three of us are foxy ladies.\\
156 - Oh, I'm a recent
college graduate\\
157 - with big boobs and
an urge to explore.\\
158 - I'll show Daddy.\\
159 - Okay, now,
try to pick one of us up.\\
160 - What are you doing, man?\\
161 - You looked the lightest.\\
162 - All right, put me down.\\
163 - Okay.
You're dumb and lazy.\\
164 - Oh, there's my lady.\\
165 - Excuse me,
you're blocking the aisle.\\
166 - Hey.\\
167 - Hi, Leo.\\
168 - Come here often?\\
169 - Wow, JJ.
Seven yo-yos at one time?\\
170 - I guess an act like that really
has its ups and downs, huh?\\
171 - I'm so glad I
fought for my country\\
172 - so that grown man
could play with his yo-yo.\\
173 - Oh, shushy-shushy,
grumpety-grump.\\
174 - Now, before we go,
I'd like to introduce\\
175 - the newest family member
of What's Up Wisconsin.\\
176 - She's my assistant.
She's Jackie Burkhart.\\
177 - Come on, honey.
Come on in here.\\
178 - Oh, my God, I'm on TV.\\
179 - Well, for all of you
watching in black and white,\\
180 - I am wearing a navy twin set, and
my eye shadow is periwinkle blue.\\
181 - Holy macaroni! It's Jackie!
I know someone who's on TV!\\
182 - What do you know!
It really is an idiot box.\\
183 - Jackie brings me
the most delicious brownies.\\
184 - Brownies.
Red, those are my brownies.\\
185 - Oh, they look so
much bigger on TV.\\
186 - So moist, you don't even
have to drink milk with them.\\
187 - No milk! That is the highest
compliment a brownie can have.\\
188 - Now, Jackie darling, I must
know where you got them.\\
189 - From me!
She got them from me!\\
190 - Got them?
I made them. Myself.\\
191 - What?\\
192 - It's an old
Burkhart family recipe.\\
193 - You lying little midget!\\
194 - This might be a bad time to ask,\\
195 - but are you gonna start
getting lunch together?\\
196 - I can't believe Leo likes me.\\
197 - I feel like I'm
back in the third grade\\
198 - and the slow kid who picks his
nose just gave me a valentine.\\
199 - See, that is what you get
for leading Leo on\\
200 - with your tight
jeans and your heaving\\
201 - chest and your
large bedroom window.\\
202 - You know, there's a good chance\\
203 - Leo will forget
this whole thing.\\
204 - Just like he forgot that
other thing. The sixties.\\
205 - Well, what am I gonna do?
I mean,\\
206 - I don't wanna hurt his feelings.\\
207 - Donna, I know this is weird for
you, but you have to remember,\\
208 - it is hilarious for us.\\
209 - I think you and Leo could be
great together. I can see it now.\\
210 - I have to go talk to him.
I ain't havin' no Leo baby.\\
211 - Whoa! Mrs. Forman,
you gotta help me.\\
212 - I need another batch of
brownies and I need them bad.\\
213 - Okay. First,
preheat the oven to 350,\\
214 - then stick your head inside\\
215 - and bake the lies out of
your lying mouth, you little liar!\\
216 - Please, it's the only thing that
keeps Christine off my back.\\
217 - I'm gonna lose my job.
Please, you've gotta help me.\\
218 - Please.\\
219 - Oh, that is so fake.\\
220 - Oh, damn. Fine. I'm sorry.\\
221 - Look, Christine
caught me off guard.\\
222 - I was on TV.
I didn't know what to say.\\
223 - How about Kitty Forman
baked the brownies?\\
224 - See how easy that was?
I can even say it backwards.\\
225 - Brownies the baked Forman Kitty.\\
226 - Okay, okay, you're right.\\
227 - But now I'm in too deep,
so I am begging you.\\
228 - Please, could you just make
some more brownies?\\
229 - Drop it, Jackie.
I am not gonna let you\\
230 - continue to take credit
for all of my hard work.\\
231 - What if I take you
to the studio and\\
232 - introduce you to
Christine St. George?\\
233 - I'll get the eggs.
You grease the pan.\\
234 - Hyde, I thought you said Leo
was supposed to be here today.\\
235 - Yeah. I put him
on the schedule,\\
236 - which means he is
either on his way in,\\
237 - or on his way to San Francisco
to see the Dead show.\\
238 - I just wanna get this over
with. It's gonna be so hard.\\
239 - Donna, I know how you
must feel. Soft and smooth.\\
240 - There's my girl.\\
241 - Hi, Leo.\\
242 - Leo, you didn't have
to get me chocolates.\\
243 - Chocolates?
That's my lunch.\\
244 - Leo, look. I'm really
flattered that you like me,\\
245 - but I can't be your girlfriend.\\
246 - Is it because I'm black?\\
247 - You're not black.\\
248 - So, it's not that then. I know
what it is. You like that Randy guy.\\
249 - What? No, I don't.\\
250 - Yes, you do.\\
251 - So I think maybe it's best
if we stop seeing each other.\\
252 - Wait a minute, you're
breaking up with me?\\
253 - I'm sorry, but I just
can't date a racist.\\
254 - So, man, how did it go?\\
255 - He thinks I like Randy.
Can you believe that?\\
256 - Donna. Leo has never been
right about anything in his life.\\
257 - Except for the fact
that you're into Randy.\\
258 - What are you talking about?\\
259 - Hi, Randy.
I like music. Do you like music too?\\
260 - Shut up.\\
261 - Look
at my butt. I made it just for you.\\
262 - You are so far off.\\
263 - Come on, man. You're in
the store more than I am.\\
264 - You giggle at
everything he says.\\
265 - You guys are like a bad Carpenters
song. Or like any Carpenters song.\\
266 - Okay. Fine. Maybe I
like him a little bit.\\
267 - But if you tell anyone I
will freakin' kick your ass.\\
268 - You bitch.\\
269 - So, Leo. You're single
again. You gonna be okay?\\
270 - Yeah. I've already got my eye
on somebody better.\\
271 - Excuse me.\\
272 - Hey, come here often?\\
273 - Join us tomorrow as
we examine the pain\\
274 - suffered by a local family
from religious prejudice.\\
275 - And Sparky, the water-skiing
squirrel, will be here too.\\
276 - Until then, What's Up Wisconsin?\\
277 - Oh, Miss St. George,
that was a great show.\\
278 - Oh, thank you.
Um, you know what?\\
279 - I would love for you to meet
one of your biggest fans.\\
280 - Uh, this is Kitty Forman.\\
281 - Hello.
Christine.\\
282 - Oh, it is such
an honor to meet you.\\
283 - You look so much
taller in person.\\
284 - Of course, we only
have a 19-inch TV set.\\
285 - Okay. I also brought
you some brownies.\\
286 - Oh, isn't that wonderful of her?\\
287 - You know, Jackie, I was
thinking that on tomorrow's show\\
288 - you and I might
make these brownies.\\
289 - You know, you'd stir the eggs and
I'd come up with some funny yolks.\\
290 - A cooking segment?\\
291 - Oh, that is just... That is
just my dream come true.\\
292 - For you.\\
293 - Oh, Miss St. George, I
have to tell you something.\\
294 - I didn't bake the
brownies. Kitty did.\\
295 - Who's Kitty, dear?\\
296 - Um, that's me.\\
297 - Oh. Well, good for you.\\
298 - Would you, uh, give me just
a moment with my assistant?\\
299 - Oh, of course.
Thank you.\\
300 - Okay, would it be okay if I just
sat in your chair for a minute?\\
301 - Oh sure. My fake
casa is your fake casa.\\
302 - Okay, Miss St. George,
I'm really sorry.\\
303 - No.\\
304 - What you showed me just now\\
305 - proves that you are a sweet,
honest, young woman.\\
306 - And that crap will get you
nowhere in show business.\\
307 - So what? I'm supposed
to lie and cheat\\
308 - and take credit for
other people's work?\\
309 - That's how I paid
for my Mercedes.\\
310 - You can't be afraid to be tough.\\
311 - Oh, I'm tough.
I'm very, very tough.\\
312 - People always say
what a bitch I am.\\
313 - Well, for your sake,
I hope they're right.\\
314 - Now, please. Get this
crazy lady off my set.\\
315 - Coming up next, a potato chip
that looks like Henry Kissinger.\\
316 - See if you can find that potato
chip. It sounds fascinating.\\
317 - Before we bring on
the tap-dancing parrot,\\
318 - I have a correction
to make from yesterday's show.\\
319 - Red. She's gonna say
my name. Are you taping it?\\
320 - Do you know how
to use the machine?\\
321 - Yes, I know how
to use the machine.\\
322 - Those brownies I so
enjoyed were made by\\
323 - the talented and
lovely Kitty Forshack.\\
324 - Forshack?\\
325 - No, no, that doesn't sound
right. Ah! Forman. Kathy Forman.
\subsection {Episode 12: Killer Queen}
1 - Hey, Red,
I got a question for you.\\
2 - My wife says she doesn't want
anything for Valentine's Day.\\
3 - So I'm off the hook, right?\\
4 - Let me tell you a little
story.\\
5 - There was a woman, a newlywed.\\
6 - And she told her husband,
"Rather than waste money on gifts,\\
7 - "save for retirement." And
so he never bought her a gift.\\
8 - Not for Christmas,
birthdays, never.\\
9 - And 50 years later,
she thanked him.\\
10 - And you know who
that woman was? No.\\
11 - That woman was the invisible
dancing fairy of Dumb Ass Land.\\
12 - All women want gifts.\\
13 - Well, what do you
get a stripper anyway?\\
14 - Ooh! How about a robe
and a father who gave a damn?\\
15 - Mrs. Forman,
life's a trade-off.\\
16 - If her father gave a damn, I
wouldn't have this smile on my face.\\
17 - Well, Steven,
it is important to keep\\
18 - romance alive
once you're married.\\
19 - That's why I bought a present for
Red and I'm sure he has one for me.\\
20 - Because he loves me and
he knows what I'm capable of.\\
21 - That's right, honey! Wait
till you see what I got you!\\
22 - You romantic little devil, you.\\
23 - Not hardly.
Follow me, rookie.\\
24 - Ever since I forgot Kitty's
birthday that one year,\\
25 - I keep a stash of
gifts down here.\\
26 - That way, even if I forget,
I remember.\\
27 - Go ahead, I'll spot you one.\\
28 - Oh, hey, these wool mittens
will be perfect for Sam.\\
29 - If only they were black,
leather and a bra.\\
30 - So what are you giving Kitty?
Ah, this needlepoint.\\
31 - She'll like it because it's
fun, and I'll like it because\\
32 - it'll keep her occupied
for gigantic chunks of time.\\
33 - Jackie, dear, thank you
for booking that lovely couple\\
34 - on our Fools for Love piece.\\
35 - I know, that guy was so cute.\\
36 - You know, he said no matter
where he went he always heard\\
37 - his wife's voice saying,
"I love you."\\
38 - Ah! Well, apparently
another voice in his head\\
39 - told him to push her
off a Ferris wheel.\\
40 - Oh, my God!\\
41 - Oh, no, no, no, no,
that's horrible!\\
42 - It's a tragedy! We don't have
a couple for today's show.\\
43 - You've got three hours to
find another one or you're fired!\\
44 - Oh, I'm just kidding.\\
45 - No, I'm not.\\
46 - Seriously, Jackie,
just kidding about firing you.\\
47 - Christine St. George's office.\\
48 - I wasn't kidding.\\
49 - Psst! Jackie! Come here!\\
50 - Oh, what do you want?\\
51 - I wanted to say don't worry.\\
52 - It'll all work out between
you and Christine.\\
53 - Oh. Well, thanks.\\
54 - Christine St. George's office.\\
55 - You're gonna get fired!\\
56 - You're gonna get fired!\\
57 - Hanging out\\
58 - Down the street\\
59 - The same old thing\\
60 - We did last week\\
61 - Not a thing to do\\
62 - But talk to you\\
63 - We're all all right\\
64 - We're all all right\\
65 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
66 - Hey, record guy. Mr. Record.
Mr. Record Breaker.\\
67 - Captain Record of
the USS Phonograph.\\
68 - Donna, Hyde's already
given me a nickname.\\
69 - It's Mrs. Lady Lovely Locks.\\
70 - Okay, Mrs. Locks, um,\\
71 - I was wondering if maybe
you'd like to, I don't know,\\
72 - like do something with
me tonight, for good old VD.\\
73 - Valentine's Day!\\
74 - Not VD.
I am clean as a whistle.\\
75 - Man, it's really
nice of you to ask\\
76 - but I've already got plans
with someone else.\\
77 - Maybe a rain check?\\
78 - Sure, I love rain checks. In
fact, I love checking for rain.\\
79 - I'm gonna go check
for rain right now.\\
80 - That's the office.
There's no rain in there.\\
81 - Clear out here too!\\
82 - Ugh! Fez! I have to find a happy couple for
Christine to interview today or I'm fired.\\
83 - What about Red and Miss Kitty?\\
84 - Ugh! I might as well
just book that painting\\
85 - of the old lady and the
geezer with the pitchfork!\\
86 - I see where you're
going with this, Jackie,\\
87 - and don't worry,
if it will save your job,\\
88 - I will pretend to
be your boyfriend.\\
89 - We should probably practice.\\
90 - Oh! Get off me!\\
91 - I was trying to help!\\
92 - You were trying to cop a feel!\\
93 - You didn't let me finish.\\
94 - I was trying to help myself
to a handful of your boob.\\
95 - But I would like to help.\\
96 - No, Fez, if Christine finds
out we're faking it, I'm fired.\\
97 - I can sell it, baby.\\
98 - Besides, interracial
couples are sexy.\\
99 - Because it's illegal.\\
100 - Fez, it's not illegal for people
of two different races to date.\\
101 - It's not?
Uh-uh.\\
102 - Freaking Hyde!\\
103 - Hey.
Hey.\\
104 - Look, I just wanna
make sure you didn't get\\
105 - the wrong idea
when I asked you out,\\
106 - because I was asking
you out as like... As friends.\\
107 - Well, I'm glad you
consider me a friend,\\
108 - because when I said I had plans
earlier, I actually have a date.\\
109 - Oh.\\
110 - And I was thinking maybe you could
help me out and give me some advice.\\
111 - You know, from the
female perspective.\\
112 - I'd ask my cousin but she's
kind of into me. It's weird.\\
113 - Sure, yeah. I mean,
what do you have planned?\\
114 - I was thinking, we start sweet
with strawberry wine.\\
115 - Then, we get a tad naughty
with dirty word Mad Libs.\\
116 - And then, hold on, what's this?\\
117 - Tickets to the Monster
Truck Mud Mayhem!\\
118 - Wow, Randy, that sounds
like a great idea,\\
119 - if you're dating Granny from
The Beverly Hillbillies.\\
120 - It's just there's something I
don't like about the usual roses,\\
121 - fancy dinner and
theater tickets.\\
122 - It's so expensive.\\
123 - Hey, Leo, what's your
idea of a romantic date?\\
124 - November 13th.\\
125 - But this year it's ruined,
man. I gotta go to the dentist.\\
126 - Well, I hope you two lovebirds are ready
to tell us all about your relationship.\\
127 - We sure are.
We've been dating so long,\\
128 - we finish each other's...\\
129 - Sentences.\\
130 - Well, I was going to say
sandwiches, but whatever.\\
131 - Okay, here we go.\\
132 - What's Up Wisconsin?\\
133 - It's time for our annual Fools for
Love segment, and with me today\\
134 - is my assistant, Jackie
Burkhart, and her boyfriend, Fez...\\
135 - How do you pronounce
your last name?\\
136 - Oh, the first five
K's are silent.\\
137 - See how they look at each other!\\
138 - It's just the way Sonny used to look
at me while Cher was in make-up.\\
139 - So, tell us how you two met.\\
140 - Well, um...\\
141 - I'll take this one, baby.\\
142 - It was the third grade. Jackie
came to school with pink eye.\\
143 - All the kids teased her, so I
rubbed her eye and infected myself,\\
144 - so she wouldn't be alone.\\
145 - I guess you can say it was love
at first sight! Pink sight, that is.\\
146 - Well, I'm sure my viewers are dying
to know the secret of your happiness.\\
147 - It's very simple.\\
148 - We make out every chance
we get. Kiss me, baby!\\
149 - No! No, no, baby, baby,
I have a cold sore.\\
150 - Well, baby, that wouldn't be the first
time I got a disease from you, baby.\\
151 - No, no, baby, I just...
I ate some garlic bread.\\
152 - Oh, baby, that's perfect!
I just ate spaghetti, baby!\\
153 - Oh, baby!
Baby?\\
154 - Baby!
Baby!\\
155 - Baby?
Baby!\\
156 - Oh, come on, Jackie. Give
your man a Valentine's Day kiss!\\
157 - Whoo!
Call the fire department!\\
158 - You can't fake
passion like that.\\
159 - We'll be right back.\\
160 - Wow! Well,
that was terrific.\\
161 - Jackie, thank you.
You outdid yourself, darling.\\
162 - And Fez, as usual, I didn't
understand a word you said.\\
163 - Fez! We did it!
Oh, you totally saved my job.\\
164 - Yes, and you totally were not kidding
when you said you ate garlic bread.\\
165 - Oh! There's my valentine.\\
166 - Oh!
See, now, the card is a heart.\\
167 - Actually, it's your heart,
and it's saying,\\
168 - "Hi, Red, remember
when I attacked you?"\\
169 - It's a reminder to cut back
on fatty, fried foods.\\
170 - Well, that's real cute.
I'll tell you what.\\
171 - You close your eyes
and start counting\\
172 - and I'll be right
back with your gift!\\
173 - One, two, three, four...\\
174 - What the hell?\\
175 - Oh, no!\\
176 - ...23, 24, 25, 26,\\
177 - 27, 28, 29, 30,\\
178 - 31, 32, 33...\\
179 - Huh?\\
180 - Miss St. George,
are you okay?\\
181 - Yes, this happens
to me every Valentine's Day.\\
182 - I see a couple in
love and it reminds me\\
183 - that I am missing the one thing\\
184 - that every woman needs
to feel good about herself.\\
185 - A friend that's fatter then you?\\
186 - Love! I sacrificed
love for my career\\
187 - and sometimes I think I
maybe did the wrong thing.\\
188 - Have a drink with me.\\
189 - Really?\\
190 - Tell me all about yourself.\\
191 - Who you are,
what makes you tick.\\
192 - Well, um...
No!\\
193 - Let's go back to me.\\
194 - I was born in a small hamlet\\
195 - just outside a little place
I like to call New York.\\
196 - And so I returned
safely to base camp,\\
197 - that half-frozen
Sherpa on my back.\\
198 - There's a famous
Tibetan folksong about it.\\
199 - Wow. You're incredible.\\
200 - So are you.\\
201 - Here's to you, dear.\\
202 - No, to you,
Miss St. George.\\
203 - Well, that's what I meant.\\
204 - Why on God's green earth
would I drink to you?\\
205 - You're cut off.\\
206 - So do I look okay?\\
207 - I just wanna make sure my outfit doesn't
send the wrong message to my date.\\
208 - Okay, well, what message
are you trying to send?\\
209 - I'd like it to say,
"Hi, my name's Randy.\\
210 - "I'm a fun-loving yet
slightly naughty guy.\\
211 - "The little boy in me is insecure,
but the man in me is cocky,\\
212 - "giving me a playfully heady
mix of humility and aloofness.\\
213 - "I like you. Let's party!"\\
214 - I think you are asking a little too
much from a jacket, but go have fun.\\
215 - Okay, Donna,
your valentine's here!\\
216 - I thought we'd start with
some hangman, then move into\\
217 - something that really gets
the pulse racing, like Yahtzee.\\
218 - All right, just so long as when you
get Yahtzee you don't yell, "Poopsie!"\\
219 - That's not a promise I can make.\\
220 - Ooh, pizza!\\
221 - Oh, you're back.\\
222 - Hope your car's not blocking the
driveway. We're expecting a pizza.\\
223 - Donna, will you go out with me
on a big Valentine's Day date?\\
224 - What about the other girl?\\
225 - There is no other girl.\\
226 - I just think you're hot
and I want to go out with you.\\
227 - Oh!\\
228 - I'm her father and
I'm standing right here!\\
229 - Here, Mr. Pinciotti.
Pizza's on me.\\
230 - Have her home by sunrise.\\
231 - Hey, Kitty.
Oh.\\
232 - Hi, Red.\\
233 - Sorry I didn't get
around to making dinner,\\
234 - but I was too
busy counting to 956.\\
235 - Well, it's gonna be worth it,
'cause I found your gift.\\
236 - Oh! Look at that.
Pack of gum. Tire gauge.\\
237 - Actually, the gum
was for me. Red!\\
238 - Kitty, you always said
it's the thought that counts.\\
239 - Oh, I said that to
Eric when he was five\\
240 - and he gave me that
stupid macaroni frame.\\
241 - You! What did you do?\\
242 - I'm sorry, Red. I was down
there picking out a gift for Sam,\\
243 - and she caught me and
assumed everything was for her.\\
244 - And she started
kissing me everywhere,\\
245 - and I just handed everything
over to her. That's her power, man.\\
246 - Good God, Steven,
the whole stash?\\
247 - Look, I know I owe you
an apology, but can it wait?\\
248 - 'Cause Sam just sent me up here
to grab some whipped cream, so...\\
249 - Sorry.\\
250 - Okay, what were you
two talking about?\\
251 - Well, Kitty, I had a stash of gifts
down there for every occasion.\\
252 - That way, if I forgot to buy you
something, I'd still be covered.\\
253 - You buy my gifts in bulk?\\
254 - No, it's more of
a vast inventory of love.\\
255 - Well, you're about to get a vast
inventory of my foot in your ass!\\
256 - Yeah! I can do that too!\\
257 - Wow. So this was
for me all along?\\
258 - Yeah.\\
259 - For one day I wanted to transform
this crappy little record store\\
260 - into a crappy little bistro.\\
261 - Thanks.\\
262 - So, when I asked you out, why did
you pretend to have another date?\\
263 - Donna, I've wanted to
ask you out for a long time.\\
264 - And then you kind
of beat me to it\\
265 - and I'm kind of
a traditional guy.\\
266 - I like to make the first move.\\
267 - But if you wanted to make the
second move, well, you're in luck.\\
268 - I'm not wearing a bra.\\
269 - That's good to know.\\
270 - Hey! I just had
the best meal, man!\\
271 - Somebody left two whole
steak dinners in there!\\
272 - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
off to the monster truck show.\\
273 - Would you just listen?\\
274 - Oh, Red, I'd love to
talk to you but I have to\\
275 - check the pressure in my tires.\\
276 - Hey, Red, Kitty told Sam
the presents weren't for her.\\
277 - Now I'm kind of in trouble.\\
278 - So I got us each a bouquet
of flowers for our ladies.\\
279 - Kitty, I got you roses!
See how it feels, dumbass?\\
280 - Jackie, come in. Please.\\
281 - I just wanna thank you
for yesterday.\\
282 - I feel we really bonded,\\
283 - as much as a star
can bond with a commoner.\\
284 - Well, I'm really
glad that we talked.\\
285 - You know, I got to see
there's a real person in there.\\
286 - Someone with hopes
and fears and emotions.\\
287 - Well, I'm only human.\\
288 - And you snuck a rare peek
behind my iron curtain, didn't you?\\
289 - I know. You know, I really
feel like I got to know you better.\\
290 - Yes, you did,
and so you're fired.\\
291 - Wait, what?\\
292 - I cannot have an employee
know so much about me.\\
293 - And since your TV career is
finished, may I suggest bartending?\\
294 - You pour a mean Scotch, lady.\\
295 - No, no, no, this isn't fair.
I worked my butt off for you.\\
296 - Thank you.
Out you go. Go on.\\
297 - Go on.\\
298 - Okay, all right, you know
what? Nobody here likes you.\\
299 - They only pretend to like you
because you're famous.\\
300 - And I pretend to like them
because they bring me lunch.\\
301 - Oh, God!\\
302 - You are a crazy, bitter lady with
a hole where your heart should be!\\
303 - Now, is that supposed to hurt
me? I have a mug that says that.\\
304 - Those shoes are so last season!\\
305 - Rot in hell,
you worthless maggot!\\
306 - Well, I guess that's it.\\
307 - Oh, I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.\\
308 - What do you know, I didn't.\\
309 - Okay, look, Christine
is obviously looking\\
310 - for a new assistant, so I
put in a good word for you.\\
311 - Really? Even though I was
so mean to you? Wow, thanks.\\
312 - Mmm-hmm.\\
313 - What's Up Wisconsin.\\
314 - I licked your phone!
I licked your phone!
\subsection {Episode 13: Spread Your Wings}
1 - Wow. I didn't think I was
gonna like Kramer vs. Kramer.\\
2 - But that's back when I thought
we were gonna watch it.\\
3 - Yeah, for a PG movie
there's a lot of sexual content.\\
4 - You know, I have noticed
something about you.\\
5 - You only like to make out
in secret, dark places.\\
6 - What?
What are you talking about?\\
7 - Yesterday, you drove me
a half a mile into the woods.\\
8 - I've never dated
an Italian girl.\\
9 - I thought I was
gonna get whacked.\\
10 - Well, it's just... Okay, I'm a little
nervous about telling my friends about us.\\
11 - Come on. What's the worst thing
that could happen if we told them?\\
12 - Okay, let me put it this way.\\
13 - Two years ago, I walked into the basement
and my jeans had a hole in the butt.\\
14 - To this day they
call me Poopchute Sally.\\
15 - Poopchute Sally?\\
16 - Okay, let's go, I don't want to
run into anyone after the movie.\\
17 - Ooh! Busted!\\
18 - Wow!\\
19 - Unbelievable.\\
20 - After all that, she gives the kid back
to Dustin Hoffman? That bitch is crazy!\\
21 - Hanging out\\
22 - Down the street\\
23 - The same old thing\\
24 - We did last week\\
25 - Not a thing to do\\
26 - But talk to you\\
27 - We're all all right\\
28 - We're all all right\\
29 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
30 - I can't get over Donna and
Randy making out like that.\\
31 - It was all broad shoulders and blond hair.
I could barely tell which one was the boy.\\
32 - They should save that passion
for her bedroom,\\
33 - where I have a better view.\\
34 - I thought it was like watching
Donna make out with Forman,\\
35 - except Randy wasn't constantly
saying, "I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"\\
36 - Well, we're off to buy
curtains for Eric's room.\\
37 - We're making it into a sewing
area, so I thought a nice floral print\\
38 - might really pretty it up.\\
39 - It's all part of our plan to
make Eric's room less girlie.\\
40 - I wanted to make
my room more manly,\\
41 - so I put up some posters
of the Village People.\\
42 - Mission accomplished.\\
43 - Oh, oh, oh, well, I want to get to the fabric
store before Mary's quilting club shows up.\\
44 - Those fat cows think they own
the remnant box.\\
45 - Oh, crap.\\
46 - I stashed something real important
and real illegal up in Forman's room.\\
47 - Where'd you hide it?\\
48 - I don't know.\\
49 - I was under the
influence of it when I hid it.\\
50 - Oh! Hey, it's Donna and Randy.\\
51 - Where have you guys been,
Donna and Randy?\\
52 - Oh! Well, I was at the park,\\
53 - where I was practicing my violin\\
54 - for a family of ducks.\\
55 - I was at home.\\
56 - Huh. That's simple.\\
57 - Really? 'Cause, you know, we
went to see Kramer vs. Kramer,\\
58 - but instead we saw Randy's
hand versus Donna's bra strap.\\
59 - I believe it was directed
by Francis Ford Cop-A-Feel.\\
60 - Donna! Why didn't you just tell
us you were going out with Randy?\\
61 - I don't know. It was just, you
know... You guys are friends with Eric\\
62 - and I didn't know
what you'd think.\\
63 - I'm happy for you.\\
64 - Yeah, man, whatever.\\
65 - Yeah, I think it's great.\\
66 - I mean, you finally found a guy who is
stronger than you, and that's hard to do.\\
67 - Okay, great! Cool, now we can all
hang out and it won't be awkward.\\
68 - You know, it's this kind of
awkwardness reminds me of a time\\
69 - my dad brought this chick home.\\
70 - And in the morning,
she turned out to be a guy.\\
71 - Although Tony did make me
a kick-ass Denver omelet.\\
72 - Well, I have a question that I
think will make things less awkward.\\
73 - Randy, when you kiss Donna,
is it smooth like melted fudge?\\
74 - Or rough like a cock fight?\\
75 - Fez! Now, that is personal!\\
76 - So have you guys had sex yet?\\
77 - Jackie!\\
78 - My money is on no. Donna is
a strong, independent woman\\
79 - who feels that men should
respect women for their minds.\\
80 - In other words,
she's a big fat tease.\\
81 - Well, I think it's
going to happen soon.\\
82 - Because normally, Donna only
shaves her legs up to her knees.\\
83 - But this morning, she went all
the way from Miami to Jacksonville.\\
84 - Oh, Fez, thank you so much for
getting me a job as a hair consultant.\\
85 - Well, I told my boss that you
were reliable and hard-working.\\
86 - Aw, you lied for me.\\
87 - - Hey there, Fez.
- Hilary.\\
88 - I saved you a bite
of my cinnamon muffin.\\
89 - Oh, what a coincidence. I saved
you a bite of my cinnamon bun!\\
90 - Oh, I would do anything to go
out with that hot little number.\\
91 - Well,
have you asked her out yet?\\
92 - Well, I've found that if a man creates
mystery, the woman will come to him.\\
93 - - So you're scared?
- Terrified.\\
94 - But I think it is time
for you to get to work.\\
95 - Okay. Wow.\\
96 - So, okay, the first thing we're
gonna do is get rid of these curls,\\
97 - 'cause they kind of make
you look like a poodle.\\
98 - What the hell are you doing?\\
99 - You are not supposed
to talk to the customers!\\
100 - What...
I am the hair consultant!\\
101 - I just said that to get you
down here. The truth is,\\
102 - you're our sweep-up girl.\\
103 - What? No, that's the pathetic
foreign girl with the wandering eye\\
104 - who sweeps up the hair.\\
105 - No. She's your boss.\\
106 - Oh.\\
107 - I've always been
curious about something.\\
108 - Heavens!\\
109 - Oh. Hey.\\
110 - Didn't know you guys
were starting this early.\\
111 - It's 2:00 in the afternoon!\\
112 - Yeah, that damn school bus bringing
home those kids woke me up again.\\
113 - So, uh, you guys find
anything interesting?\\
114 - Oh, well.\\
115 - I did find this Good
Housekeeping under Eric's bed.\\
116 - And apparently, he was very
interested in self breast exams.\\
117 - Yeah. Mrs. Forman, I think the
only thing he was interested in\\
118 - was examining himself.\\
119 - Oh, well, Steven, that is a
perfectly normal biological function.\\
120 - And my baby never did that!\\
121 - Hey, Red, you need some help?\\
122 - Nah, nah, I'm just boxing up
some of Eric's awards.\\
123 - Oh, it was a proud day when
he came home with this beauty.\\
124 - "Cub Scout Fair.\\
125 - "Prettiest
Non-Functioning Kite."\\
126 - Uh, Mrs. Forman, my dad said
you had something for me.\\
127 - Oh, yes, honey.\\
128 - I found some things I thought
you might wanna hold on to.\\
129 - These are gifts and notes
that you gave to Eric\\
130 - and it's not like I read any of them,
but you have some potty-mouth.\\
131 - Mrs. Forman, like, seriously,
Eric and I are through.\\
132 - Oh, honey, I know you think that
now, but he'll be back soon and you'll...\\
133 - You'll have one of those talks on
the hood of the car. Yes, I watch!\\
134 - But you'll be
right back together.\\
135 - No, we won't.
I'm... I'm moving on.\\
136 - And it's not easy, 'cause,
I mean, everywhere I look,\\
137 - something reminds me of Eric.\\
138 - I'm sure this area in particular
brings back a lot of memories.\\
139 - You went out again last night?\\
140 - Yup. I left the club with a creamy
white girl and a chocolaty black girl.\\
141 - We went home
and made hot fudge sundae.\\
142 - And then we did it.\\
143 - Uh, Fez,
why are you lying to her?\\
144 - Shh!\\
145 - But you didn't
go out last night.\\
146 - You were lying in front of the TV trying
to look up Victoria Principal's dress.\\
147 - Don't you have some hair
to sweep, sweep-up girl?\\
148 - Huh? No. The place is clean.\\
149 - Don't worry, that's how the
kids are wearing it nowadays.\\
150 - Happy birthday,
Eric! I have a sexy surprise for you.\\
151 - Look across into my window.\\
152 - Yeah, I thought you'd like those.
Now, come over here, and I'll...\\
153 - - Hey!
- Hey!\\
154 - What's up?\\
155 - Nothing.
Just, you know, hanging out.\\
156 - Cool. Never sat on the hood
of a car with a girl before.\\
157 - Yeah, actually, you know what?
This car was kind of...\\
158 - - Ooh! Light saber!
- Oh.\\
159 - Yeah,
that belonged to someone...\\
160 - - Check it out!
- ...else.\\
161 - I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you!\\
162 - Stop it!\\
163 - What the hell?\\
164 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. This
is... This is just too weird.\\
165 - I can't do this.
I can't see you anymore.\\
166 - You could've just said
you didn't like Star Wars.\\
167 - Mrs. Forman, you wouldn't believe
the lies Fez tells this girl at work.\\
168 - I mean, he is pretending to be
someone else completely.\\
169 - So what? You pretend to be someone
else every time you put on make-up.\\
170 - I have seen you in the morning.
Your face looks like scrambled eggs.\\
171 - Well, we all do
a little pretending.\\
172 - Sometimes, when I'm
bringing in the groceries,\\
173 - I pretend to be Scarlett O'Hara.\\
174 - And I look at all
the brown bags and I say,\\
175 - "As God is my witness,\\
176 - "I'll never go hungry again!"\\
177 - Oh! Oh!
And sometimes with Red, I...\\
178 - Okay, well, the point is,
it's okay to pretend.\\
179 - Look, I like Hilary, and I was
afraid that if she knew the real Fez\\
180 - that she wouldn't like me,\\
181 - so I created a new Fez.\\
182 - A better Fez.
I call this Fez "Work Fez."\\
183 - You should see me down there.\\
184 - Okay, let's do this!\\
185 - Who is the man that would
risk his neck for his brother man\\
186 - Fez\\
187 - You're damn right.\\
188 - Who's the cat that won't cop
out when there's danger all about?\\
189 - Fez\\
190 - Right on.\\
191 - Yo, they say this
cat Fez is a bad mother...\\
192 - Shut your mouth\\
193 - I'm talking about Fez\\
194 - And we can dig it\\
195 - He's a complicated man and no
one understands him but his woman\\
196 - Work Fez\\
197 - I wondered why the last time I came
in you said my hair looked blackalicious.\\
198 - Hyde, I hope I did the
right thing with Randy.\\
199 - It just felt weird, starting
up a new relationship.\\
200 - Yeah, well, you know, it's tough when
you've been with someone for a long time.\\
201 - Like, just the other day,
I heard this burglar alarm,\\
202 - and it was making this really
awful high-pitched squealing noise.\\
203 - I found myself
thinking about Jackie.\\
204 - Well, you know, I think I might
have hurt Randy's feelings.\\
205 - - Hey, Donna.
- Hi.\\
206 - Randy is helping me build
Kitty's sewing table.\\
207 - We're gonna make it real nice so she
feels obliged to spend hours up here.\\
208 - Hey, Steven.\\
209 - How about taking a ride with me down
to the lumberyard before they close?\\
210 - - No, I'm good.
- Nah, you're coming.\\
211 - See, I know that
you hid dope up here.\\
212 - And if you found
it while I was gone,\\
213 - I'd miss that pathetic look on your
face when I flush it down the toilet.\\
214 - You're a real messed-up dude.\\
215 - Yeah. Come on.\\
216 - So, um,\\
217 - Randy, I just wanna make sure that,
you know, I hope we can still be friends.\\
218 - Yeah. I'm cool with that.\\
219 - Well, aren't you
just Beaver freakin' Cleaver?\\
220 - You want me to be a jerk?\\
221 - Well, it would make breaking
up with you a lot easier.\\
222 - Donna. I'm sorry, I don't
want this to be hard for you.\\
223 - - There you go again.
- Fine!\\
224 - I won't say another word!\\
225 - Oh, now you're gonna show me
the muscles?\\
226 - "I'm Randy, I got big muscles!
I'm good-looking!"\\
227 - You're an ass!\\
228 - So, when are you and I gonna go out
and put the fever back in Saturday night?\\
229 - Or Thursday,
whenever you're free.\\
230 - I don't think I
could keep up with you.\\
231 - I think you'll be fine.\\
232 - How do you know?
Have you guys gone out?\\
233 - Oh, God, no!
No, we're just roommates.\\
234 - Wait. Fez, you told me
you had your own place.\\
235 - You called it the Feznasium.\\
236 - Of... Of course I do! I found this
poor thing wandering around the street\\
237 - so I'm letting
her stay at my pad.\\
238 - Yes, I am teaching
her the ways of love.\\
239 - Okay, that's it. Hilary, you know what?
Everything that Fez has told you is a lie.\\
240 - He doesn't go out.
He's in bed by 9:00!\\
241 - And his idea of a "threesome"
is Neapolitan ice-cream.\\
242 - Look, I don't know
what she is talking about.\\
243 - Look, this is what happens when
you hire a girl right off the boat.\\
244 - Oh, really? Okay, here, take
a look inside his backpack.\\
245 - Hey, that's my backpack!\\
246 - When the Phone Never Rings:
A Beginner's Guide to Self-Love.\\
247 - Anybody lose a backpack?\\
248 - Hey, Donna. Come here and
take a look at this sewing table.\\
249 - It's even got a cup-holder,
like Kitty asked.\\
250 - You know, that Randy is a pretty
sharp kid. He build this thing in two days.\\
251 - The only thing Eric ever made
was this crappy birdhouse.\\
252 - Oh, yeah.\\
253 - He was always too afraid to use the
drill so he just painted the hole on there.\\
254 - Yeah, and one by one, an entire
family of bluebirds flew to their deaths.\\
255 - Mr. Forman,\\
256 - what would you think if I
hypothetically,\\
257 - possibly, maybe started
dating a new guy?\\
258 - I'd say I think you can do
whatever the hell you want.\\
259 - My dumb ass son
broke up with you.\\
260 - You gotta have your own life.\\
261 - I have absolutely no problem
with you dating Randy.\\
262 - What, you know about that?\\
263 - Oh, come on.\\
264 - Your eyes nearly popped out of your
head when you saw him in that tool belt.\\
265 - Okay, cool. It really means a lot to
me that you guys are okay with this.\\
266 - No, no, no. Wait, no. I'm okay.
For the love of God, don't tell Kitty.\\
267 - I'd have to make her
a bigger cup-holder!\\
268 - Thanks a lot, Jackie. Now Hilary
thinks I'm a crazy, self-loving pervert.\\
269 - Well, she was gonna
think that eventually.\\
270 - Fez, I'm confused.
Why have you been lying to me?\\
271 - Well, I wanted you to think I
was cool, so you'd go out with me.\\
272 - But now you hate me.\\
273 - Actually, I don't.\\
274 - Before,
I was always so intimidated,\\
275 - but now that I know you're just a
regular guy, I'd totally go out with you.\\
276 - Even after you saw my...\\
277 - ...book?\\
278 - You're lonely. I think
it's cute and endearing.\\
279 - Um, I think you mean
gross and appalling.\\
280 - Jackie, he's a lost soul.\\
281 - Someone has to take care of him.\\
282 - Yes.\\
283 - I'm broken.\\
284 - Fix me.\\
285 - Perfect. It's just like
my grandpa used to say,\\
286 - "You measure it twice,
everything's nice."\\
287 - Actually, in his later years,
it was all he said.\\
288 - Hey, Red, can you hand me
that box of drawer handles?\\
289 - What's this?\\
290 - Oh! That's mine! Oh, crap.\\
291 - A macrame owl?\\
292 - What the hell kind of
pansy-ass thing is this?\\
293 - I do macrame.\\
294 - It's my therapy.\\
295 - Well, I didn't realize
you were so stressed out.\\
296 - But I think you'll feel a lot better
once you get the sex change.\\
297 - There's my therapy.\\
298 - Hey. Find your stash?\\
299 - Yep. Now I'm gonna punish it
for hiding on me\\
300 - by burning it.\\
301 - Okay, look, I've been
thinking about this,\\
302 - and before, on the car, I
think I might have over-reacted.\\
303 - It's just, I was in a relationship
for a really long time.\\
304 - And it's gonna take me a while
to get used to something new.\\
305 - Donna, I get it.\\
306 - Okay. Great. So let's just, you know,
take it slow and see where it goes.\\
307 - I'm cool with that,
Poopchute Sally.\\
308 - Shut up.\\
309 - Oh, my God!\\
310 - In Eric's bedroom?\\
311 - You two-timing whore!\\
312 - Here's a tissue.\\
313 - Thank you.\\
314 - It's gonna be okay.\\
315 - It's just so sad. How could I drop
an entire box of M&Ms on the floor?\\
316 - Do you want me to
go buy you a new one?\\
317 - It was the last one.
\subsection {Episode 14: Son and Daughter}
1 - Thank you. Enjoy your Anne Murray,
though I don't see how that's possible.\\
2 - - Hello, Steven!
- Hey, man! Hey, Leo, this is my dad, WB.\\
3 - Wow! Now I've seen everything.\\
4 - You're surprised
he's black, huh?\\
5 - No. His fly is open, man.\\
6 - Whoa. Look at all these kids.\\
7 - Pretty busy
for a Tuesday morning.\\
8 - Yeah, it's kind of a fire sale.\\
9 - We put stuff on sale and then I go down
to the high school and pull the fire alarm.\\
10 - If the store keeps doing okay, there
might be a nice bonus in your future.\\
11 - Or as I like to call it,
retroactive child support.\\
12 - Hey, who's pretty boy?\\
13 - Oh, hey. I'm Randy. But I
really wouldn't call me pretty.\\
14 - I'm more like sultry,
angular yet soft.\\
15 - Really anything that would
describe Faye Dunaway.\\
16 - So Steven, what are you and
Faye Dunaway doing this weekend?\\
17 - Oh, well, the Point Place Youth
Club's doing a big trash cleanup,\\
18 - so we were gonna go down there
and throw cans at them.\\
19 - Check these out.\\
20 - Front row tickets
to Eric Clapton in Chicago?\\
21 - That's the coolest thing
anyone has ever done for me.\\
22 - What, show you a couple of
concert tickets? You're not going.\\
23 - So listen, I stopped by to see if
you wanted to house-sit for me.\\
24 - You know, bring in the mail, water
the plants, feed my dog, whitey.\\
25 - Your dog's name is Whitey?\\
26 - No, I was talking to you.\\
27 - Yeah. I guess I can
do that. Wow, man.\\
28 - Staying at my dad's house. Be
like the childhood I never had.\\
29 - And I won't be there. Just
like the childhood you did have.\\
30 - Mrs. Forman?\\
31 - I need to talk to you.\\
32 - I'm really sorry that Randy
and I were kissing in Eric's room.\\
33 - It was inappropriate.\\
34 - Oh, actually, honey, I'm surprised
you even had time to apologize.\\
35 - I thought you'd be up there
making out with the rest of Wisconsin.\\
36 - What the hell are you doing
showing affection\\
37 - outside of your
own homes, anyway?\\
38 - Kitty and I, we never
kiss or hug in public.\\
39 - Far as the rest of the world is
concerned, we're complete strangers.\\
40 - I didn't mean to offend you. You've
always been like a mother to me.\\
41 - Like remember when you made me
hot cocoa when my parents got snowed in\\
42 - at that swingers' club?\\
43 - Oh, Donna, I'm not gonna let one
little incident ruin a lifelong friendship.\\
44 - Oh, hey, look, Red,\\
45 - this egg is kind of shaped
like Randy's head.\\
46 - And now it's trash,
just like Donna!\\
47 - Hanging out\\
48 - Down the street\\
49 - The same old thing\\
50 - We did last week\\
51 - Not a thing to do\\
52 - But talk to you\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - We're all all right\\
55 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
56 - Oh, this pineapple
reminds me of Donna.\\
57 - It's a little tart.\\
58 - Hey. Don't call my daughter
names. You can call me names.\\
59 - But I really wish you wouldn't.\\
60 - Well, I just... I don't know
what she sees in Randy.\\
61 - He's so charming and friendly and
always willing to lend a helping hand.\\
62 - What a jackass.\\
63 - I like him. He calls me Mr. P.\\
64 - How did he come
up with that one?\\
65 - Kitty, if Donna's gonna date
anyone, why not him?\\
66 - I mean, he's bright, he's good
with tools and most important,\\
67 - he has never once tried to
teach me the ways of the Jedi.\\
68 - Wait a minute.
You like Randy too?\\
69 - Well, I'm just saying, I don't hate
him as much as I hate most people.\\
70 - Well, you have said a lot of
hurtful things, but this is the worst!\\
71 - Kitty!\\
72 - She's crazy.\\
73 - This pineapple is delicious.\\
74 - See? Now, this is
the kind of house I want.\\
75 - And I know that if I work hard enough,
I can find a sucker to buy it for me.\\
76 - Damn, this place is clean,
man. Sure no woman lives here?\\
77 - Steven, please, I don't need a woman
living here to keep a clean house.\\
78 - I have a maid.\\
79 - And she's a white girl.\\
80 - And then Mrs. Forman said
you looked like an egg\\
81 - and threw your
broken head in the trash.\\
82 - Well, I don't take
it too personally\\
83 - 'cause I've noticed something about
Mrs. Forman. She's a whackadoo.\\
84 - Oh, cool!\\
85 - Peter Frampton gave
you a signed guitar!\\
86 - Hey, you know what?
I have a handful of his hair.\\
87 - And one of them has a little
piece of skin on the end of it.\\
88 - Yeah. She keeps it next
to Leif Garrett's used Q-tip.\\
89 - Hey, I had to kiss a roadie
named Larry for that one.\\
90 - Well, there's the kitchen, there's
the living room and there's the bar.\\
91 - Don't touch anything.\\
92 - Don't worry, man. I'll treat this
place like I broke into it myself.\\
93 - Hey, guys, the toilet seat
in there is heated.\\
94 - It felt so good on my face.\\
95 - Man. Watching your Dad's place
is a big responsibility.\\
96 - And I just know the 500
strangers we invite to the party\\
97 - are gonna give it
the respect it deserves.\\
98 - No way, man. WB is trusting
me. I'm not trashing his house.\\
99 - But that's the beauty of our
plan. We will trash it for you.\\
100 - Oh, Hyde doesn't want
to disappoint his daddy.\\
101 - "I'm Hyde, and I love my Dad
and he loves me\\
102 - "and we're making up for lost time
and..." Actually that's kind of touching.\\
103 - Come on, Hyde, don't you ever
want to find out\\
104 - if 500 people can
fit in that pool?\\
105 - No! All right? I'm not letting you
guys talk me into having a party.\\
106 - I'm not doing
something that stupid.\\
107 - Look, everybody!
I'm dancing like a chicken!\\
108 - Ever since I said I like Randy,\\
109 - Kitty's been stomping around,
making life miserable for me.\\
110 - I can't describe how
bad it is over there.\\
111 - Well, made you wanna come over
and hang out with me.\\
112 - That's the perfect way
to describe it!\\
113 - I'm glad you came. Taste this.\\
114 - Hmm. That tastes pretty good.\\
115 - That's 'cause it's made
with five different cheeses.\\
116 - What's it called?\\
117 - Five different cheeses.\\
118 - Oh, save room for cheesecake.\\
119 - God, this place looks great. WB
will never know we had a party.\\
120 - You missed
something behind the couch.\\
121 - Drive safe!\\
122 - You know, all this cleaning
is actually kind of satisfying.\\
123 - You know,
I bet my maid is thrilled\\
124 - she is not a doctor
in her country any more.\\
125 - Well, I cleaned all the dirty
limerick off the wall.\\
126 - I don't know where this Nantucket
place is, but the men there are disgusting.\\
127 - Man, I should not have thrown
a party here.\\
128 - It's weird, but I feel kind of guilty.
I've never felt guilty before in my life!\\
129 - Not even when the judge said,
"You're guilty."\\
130 - You think that's weird? I never took
my pants off, but my undies are gone.\\
131 - You're not gonna believe this,
but I think I'm wearing them.\\
132 - Hey! What the hell is the
guitar doing on the floor?\\
133 - Oh, uh, yeah.\\
134 - You took it down to whack
all the women in the butt with it.\\
135 - Hmm-hmm, you called it
Hyde's Spank-O-Matic.\\
136 - Well, looks all right.\\
137 - What are you talking about?
It's broken into pieces.\\
138 - Okay, we should probably say
good night here,\\
139 - because if my Dad sees us
kissing, he'll yell, "Whoo-hoo!"\\
140 - Oh, look at this.
Donna and Randy kissing!\\
141 - Whoo-hoo.\\
142 - Well, I guess I shouldn't get too upset
because, after all, it's none of my business\\
143 - what two people do in the
privacy of my own driveway.\\
144 - Mrs. Forman, I'm sorry you're
uncomfortable, but for the last time,\\
145 - Eric broke up with me!\\
146 - I don't care. You should still
be waiting for him!\\
147 - When Red went to war,
I waited for him\\
148 - and I had more men
coming after me than Hitler.\\
149 - That's different. Eric chose to go to
Africa and he chose to break up with me.\\
150 - Well, maybe he wouldn't have
left if you were a better girlfriend.\\
151 - Well, maybe if you hadn't been
so smothering and controlling,\\
152 - he wouldn't have gone halfway across
the world just to get away from you!\\
153 - Hey! That eggshell
does look like me.\\
154 - Hey, handsome.\\
155 - Come on, Red, do one more.
What am I now?\\
156 - A deer.\\
157 - Nope, a rhinoceros.
What am I know?\\
158 - A moron.\\
159 - Wrong again, I'm a deer!\\
160 - Mr. Forman, your wife just saw me
and Randy kissing in the driveway.\\
161 - Whoo-hoo!\\
162 - Then she yelled at us, so I
told her she was a bad mother\\
163 - and that Eric moved away
to Africa to get away from her.\\
164 - - Now she's really mad at me.
- Well, of course
she's mad at you, Donna!\\
165 - You can't just go around
telling people the truth!\\
166 - Why the hell
didn't you stop them?\\
167 - Because the last time
I got between two women,\\
168 - well, that actually
worked out really well.\\
169 - Well, thanks, Donna.
Now you've made it worse.\\
170 - I have to go and fix this now.\\
171 - Because if I have to stay here
another day with your dad,\\
172 - I'm gonna end up killing myself.\\
173 - No offense.\\
174 - How was that no offense?\\
175 - You should have
just said, "Offense."\\
176 - Fine. Offense.\\
177 - Okay, go. But you're gonna miss out what
I'm making for dinner. Five different meats.\\
178 - This thing is
completely destroyed.\\
179 - Yeah. You know what else
happened at the party?\\
180 - A guy grabbed my butt and his
girlfriend got really mad at him.\\
181 - Yeah, I think they broke up.\\
182 - I had a great time!\\
183 - I'm screwed, man!
WB is in the music industry.\\
184 - They can kill anyone and
make it look like an accident.\\
185 - They did it to Mama Cass.
They did it to Hendrix.\\
186 - They even took out Buddy Holly
to get to the Big Bopper!\\
187 - Oh, Hyde, you're such a baby.\\
188 - "Oh, I'm Hyde and I just lost the
trust of the father I just met and..."\\
189 - Oh, here comes
the waterworks again.\\
190 - So, I hear you and Donna
had quite the flare-up.\\
191 - You wanna tell me what happened?\\
192 - Well, your guess
is as good as mine.\\
193 - I saw Donna and
Randy in the driveway,\\
194 - I politely said, "Good day,"\\
195 - and out of nowhere
she just bit my head off.\\
196 - - Completely unprovoked?
- Completely.\\
197 - - So just like
all of our fights?
- Exactly.\\
198 - Yeah, well, look, Kitty, what
happened with Eric and Donna is normal.\\
199 - People... People move away.
They move on.\\
200 - Just like you did when I went off to
war and you dated Roger Silverman.\\
201 - You knew about that?\\
202 - Yeah, well, you guys probably shouldn't
have gone on American Bandstand.\\
203 - Well,
my situation was different.\\
204 - You were overseas.
I had to keep my options open.\\
205 - Donna's a whore.\\
206 - What do you
think, man? Can you fix it?\\
207 - I don't know, man. You kind
of caught me at a bad time.\\
208 - Right in
the middle of Hawaii Five-O.\\
209 - Leo, there's no TV in here.\\
210 - That doesn't change
the fact that it's on.\\
211 - Look, man, I actually
really need your help.\\
212 - Okay, I can fix this, man. But I
just need to do one thing to prepare.\\
213 - Okay, here we go. Gloves.\\
214 - Knife.\\
215 - Napkin.\\
216 - Can't fix a guitar
on an empty stomach.\\
217 - Oh, hi, Donna.
I didn't recognize you\\
218 - without six feet of strange
boy attached to your face.\\
219 - Mrs. Forman, about what
happened in the driveway,\\
220 - we both said some things
we probably didn't mean.\\
221 - I didn't.\\
222 - Well, I'm just saying, you
know, we both got emotional\\
223 - and we said some things
we might want to take back.\\
224 - Can't think of anything.\\
225 - You do admit that you were
in the driveway, right?\\
226 - I don't know. Looked
more like a brothel to me.\\
227 - Mrs. Forman, please.\\
228 - I just came over
here to tell you that\\
229 - this whole thing with Randy,
it was all a huge mistake.\\
230 - Oh, Donna, I am so
happy to hear you say that!\\
231 - - So are you and I okay?
- Of course we are!\\
232 - Oh, I never really saw you with
Randy anyway. He is awful handsome.\\
233 - Oh.\\
234 - No. We're still together, it's just that
we won't kiss in front of you any more.\\
235 - And for the record,
I could get any guy I want.\\
236 - I am damn hot. You should
hear the disgusting things\\
237 - construction workers say
they want to do to me.\\
238 - Oh, come on, Donna. You
don't belong with Randy anyway.\\
239 - And just wait,
when Eric gets home...\\
240 - Mrs. Forman, listen to me!\\
241 - When Eric comes back, we
are not getting back together.\\
242 - So you need to get over it.\\
243 - How am I supposed to get over
Eric running off to Africa?\\
244 - He was supposed to stay here,
marry you and give Red and me\\
245 - three wonderful grandchildren
named Ronald, Rose and Kitty Junior.\\
246 - Only everyone will call her
Kitkat, so it doesn't get confusing.\\
247 - Oh, my God. So you're not
mad at me, you're mad at Eric.\\
248 - Of course I'm mad at Eric.\\
249 - It just... It wasn't supposed
to turn out this way.\\
250 - Mrs. Forman,
I'll always care about Eric.\\
251 - But it's over.\\
252 - I know.\\
253 - So... Kitty Junior?\\
254 - Or Kitty the Second.\\
255 - Whichever you prefer,
it's your child.\\
256 - There you go,
the guitar is all fixed.\\
257 - Leo, I could kiss you, man.\\
258 - Okay, but that's as
far as you're gonna get.\\
259 - Hey, where's my kiss? I'm the
one who wiped off all the graffiti.\\
260 - What?\\
261 - Yeah, some jerk named Peter
Frampton wrote his name on it.\\
262 - Fez, you moron! This is
Peter Frampton's guitar!\\
263 - - Who?
- Peter Frampton!\\
264 - The talentless idiot that a million
brainless teenage girls made a star.\\
265 - I love Peter Frampton!\\
266 - A million and one.\\
267 - Oh, my God, my dad's here.
What am I gonna do?\\
268 - Don't worry. I'll take care of him
with this. Lights out, you son of a bitch.\\
269 - You know what?
I'll just sign it myself.\\
270 - I've written Frampton's name
on plenty of things.\\
271 - I'll just leave
off the "sucks" part.\\
272 - Hey, there, Steven!\\
273 - - Hey, man, how was Clapton?
- Great. Hey, got you a t-shirt.\\
274 - Oh. "I love Chicago."\\
275 - Yeah, I didn't remember
till I got to the airport.\\
276 - Wow, look at this place.\\
277 - You know, I was thinking about
giving you a nice cash bonus,\\
278 - - but now I don't
think I'm gonna.
- You're not?\\
279 - Nope. Check this out.\\
280 - Eric Clapton signed this guitar.\\
281 - Oh, my God, I love Clapton.\\
282 - Me too! That's why I'm
giving you the Peter Frampton.\\
283 - Actually, you know, I mean,
the store is doing great,\\
284 - you took care of the house,
so here.\\
285 - - You're giving me
the Clapton guitar?
- Yep, you deserve it.\\
286 - Uh, yeah. WB, I got something
kind of bad to tell you.\\
287 - Well, actually it's
kind of funny too.\\
288 - No, it's mostly bad.\\
289 - You know,
I'd say 50/50 funny, bad.\\
290 - I threw the most freaking awesome
party here last night and, uh, well...\\
291 - We broke your Frampton guitar.\\
292 - What's the funny part?\\
293 - Oh, you see, I was hoping
that was the funny part,\\
294 - 'cause I put
the "ha ha" in there.\\
295 - It made me laugh!\\
296 - So while I was away,
you disobeyed my wishes,\\
297 - used my house for a party\\
298 - and broke something that
was extremely valuable to me?\\
299 - I have a son!\\
300 - - You're not mad?
- Nah, 'course not.\\
301 - Do I still get
the Clapton guitar?\\
302 - Oh, hell no. I can't
trust you worth a damn.\\
303 - I have
a confession to make, too.\\
304 - I broke your toilet seat
trying to re-heat some pizza.\\
305 - Yeah, and I peed in your pool.\\
306 - Leo, you weren't even
at the party.\\
307 - I know. That's why
I peed in his pool.\\
308 - Okay, towel.\\
309 - Suction.\\
310 - Oh, we're losing him!\\
311 - Time of death, 8:29.\\
312 - Murderer!
\subsection {Episode 15: Keep Yourself Alive}
1 - Well, that was some county fair.\\
2 - And they really went all out
with the musical entertainment.\\
3 - I mean, The Beach
Girls were fabulous.\\
4 - I've never seen The Beach Boys but
I cannot imagine they are any better.\\
5 - The only thing worse than
listening to those Beach Whales\\
6 - was watching Steven throw up after
spending all day in the beer garden.\\
7 - I had a good reason
to throw up. I was drunk.\\
8 - Oh, I wish I could say I've been
drunk the whole time I went out with you.\\
9 - Oh, yeah, it's a good thing
you're not a drinker.\\
10 - You'd have a hard time operating
that heavy machinery. Your mouth!\\
11 - Well, I had a great time.\\
12 - I have an invisible dog on
a leash, a goldfish in the bag\\
13 - and a giant stuffed panda.\\
14 - Of course,
I got some stupid stuff, too.\\
15 - You know, Fez,
you should be thanking Randy.\\
16 - You were so amazing
winning all that stuff.\\
17 - With your hair flowing
and your muscles rippling.\\
18 - You were like a Greek god
of knocking things over.\\
19 - All hail Ballus Knockoverus!\\
20 - I'm still drunk.\\
21 - So how did you get so good
at popping balloons with darts?\\
22 - Well, when my parents divorced,
I found comfort in a community\\
23 - of non-judgmental
carnival workers.\\
24 - I taught them to read,\\
25 - and in exchange they taught me
how to play their games of chance.\\
26 - - Really?
- Nah, I got a dartboard.\\
27 - Well, you won every
game in the place.\\
28 - Donna, it must be nice
to finally have a boyfriend\\
29 - who can swing that sledgehammer\\
30 - and get that little black
thing past, "Seriously, hit it."\\
31 - Now, you shush. Eric
always did very well at the fair.\\
32 - Every time he went to that one booth,
he walked away with a stuffed animal.\\
33 - That was the gift shop.\\
34 - Well, Mrs.
Forman, you won a prize, too.\\
35 - I can't believe you let
that guy guess your weight.\\
36 - And I can't believe that the
woman who almost married my son\\
37 - has already moved on to the next customer
because she's as loose as an old gym sock.\\
38 - Horrus Maximus!\\
39 - And that weight-guesser never had
a chance once I took off my shoes,\\
40 - my belt, my engagement ring,
spit out my gum\\
41 - and took all
the Kleenex out of my pockets.\\
42 - Oh, Fez, honey, you
never gave me back my ring.\\
43 - Oh, yeah.\\
44 - Wow, so sparkly.\\
45 - And lost forever.\\
46 - Hanging out\\
47 - Down the street\\
48 - The same old thing\\
49 - We did last week\\
50 - Not a thing to do\\
51 - But talk to you\\
52 - We're all all right\\
53 - We're all all right\\
54 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
55 - It's gone!
My engagement ring is gone!\\
56 - You! You lost it!\\
57 - We let you into our country,
we give you minimum-wage jobs,\\
58 - we teach you how to use a knife and
a fork and this is how you thank us?\\
59 - Kitty, I hate to see you so upset
when there is such an easy solution.\\
60 - Let's just get you home,
I'll make you a martini,\\
61 - then when you calm down,
I'll make you a margarita.\\
62 - Wait, what about us?\\
63 - Oh, you're going to stay here
and look for the ring.\\
64 - And if it rains, just do
like the Indians did. Die.\\
65 - Okay. Well, the ring must
have rolled down the hill,\\
66 - which means that it's been
probably eaten by a squirrel.\\
67 - We need to find this squirrel,
feed it laxatives,\\
68 - and wait for the show to begin.\\
69 - God, we're stuck out here?
That's a bummer.\\
70 - I've been waiting to get you home
ever since you threw that ping-pong ball\\
71 - into the floating teacup.\\
72 - Maybe we can sneak off. You know,
the woods can be pretty romantic.\\
73 - That is, unless you
run into a serial killer.\\
74 - Or a witch who lives
in a house made of candy.\\
75 - Hey, you guys, you know, I was thinking
that maybe we'd find the ring faster\\
76 - if we split up into teams.\\
77 - Say, Donna, that's a great idea! But
who, may I ask, would go with whom?\\
78 - I get Donna.\\
79 - Well, that way, if we run into
a bear, I could just climb you.\\
80 - No, I was thinking I would go with
Randy and you would go with Hyde.\\
81 - No, no, no, I'm not
teaming up with Steven.\\
82 - That would be like Cher teaming
up with a really smelly drunk.\\
83 - Whoa! Did you guys hear that?\\
84 - The wild call of the
brown-haired pygmy bitch.\\
85 - - I didn't hear anything.
- There it is again!\\
86 - Hey,
this is what it's all about.\\
87 - The outdoors, just us
guys talking man-to-man.\\
88 - You know, Jackie is so annoying. I
didn't realize when we were going out.\\
89 - Sometimes you got to marry a
stripper to get things into perspective.\\
90 - Anyway, this is good.
The outdoors, just us guys,\\
91 - talking man-to-man.
It's what it's all about.\\
92 - Yeah, hey,
can I team up with Donna?\\
93 - What?
No, it's all about the guys!\\
94 - Ah, man, I can't get
between you and Donna,\\
95 - 'cause love, that's what
it's all about. And jugs.\\
96 - Especially jugs.\\
97 - Then love. But mostly jugs.
You know what I mean, man?\\
98 - Silence.
That's what it's all about.\\
99 - Oh, this is just awful.\\
100 - - Fine. I'll add more gin.
- No.\\
101 - Red, the ring. And you
know, this is all your fault.\\
102 - If you hadn't driven like
a madman over a pothole,\\
103 - I wouldn't be drinking to calm
my nerves, I would just be drinking.\\
104 - Hey, I am not the one who gave his
engagement ring to the foreign kid.\\
105 - You're lucky he is not
wearing it through his nose!\\
106 - Oh, this is just
the worst thing ever.\\
107 - - Kitty, it's just a ring!
- I am talking about the drink!\\
108 - Hey, there. I was just putting out the trash
and heard you two having a little spat,\\
109 - so I figured you'd probably
want me to come and take a side.\\
110 - Okay, well, my engagement ring is
lost and Red doesn't even give a damn.\\
111 - And I don't understand it
because even if he doesn't care\\
112 - about the sentimental value,
it still cost $1,000.\\
113 - 1,000 bucks? So you finally
replaced the old cheap one, huh?\\
114 - - What?
- Bob...\\
115 - Oh, jeez.\\
116 - You blew it now, Red.\\
117 - The old cheap one?
What is he talking about, Red?\\
118 - Kitty, I love you.\\
119 - How much did my
ring really cost?\\
120 - Right around $1,000.\\
121 - How much exactly?\\
122 - $65.\\
123 - $65? My hairdo
costs more than that!\\
124 - It does? Where
the hell are you getting...\\
125 - Which is beside the point,
because you look lovely!\\
126 - And you know what
else looks lovely?\\
127 - The view from the couch.\\
128 - Which is where your cheap,
lying butt will be sleeping tonight.\\
129 - She's right about that couch. Got
a great view of the TV from there.\\
130 - Steven is such a jerk. You know, I
can't believe I almost married a guy\\
131 - who can belch the alphabet
all the way to "W."\\
132 - You know,
he never finishes anything.\\
133 - Well, Randy is perfect.\\
134 - That lady at the fair
who did the caricatures?\\
135 - She refused to draw him
'cause she couldn't find a flaw.\\
136 - Oh, please.
That lady had no talent.\\
137 - Did you see how big
she drew my mouth?\\
138 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
139 - - Any luck finding that ring?
- No.\\
140 - But we did find a broken
high heel, some old stockings,\\
141 - and an empty pack of Marlboros.\\
142 - Yeah. So it looks like Steven's
mom has been here, too.\\
143 - You don't know my mom.
She smokes Luckys.\\
144 - Well, maybe it's time we shake
up the search parties a little bit.\\
145 - Tell you what, I'll flip a coin. Heads
me and Donna, tails me and Jackie.\\
146 - It's heads, Donna, come on.\\
147 - Wait, no, no! I can't go with
Steven. He's a disgusting pig.\\
148 - Yeah. She's a stuck-up princess
who only cares about looks and money.\\
149 - Oh, don't try to sweet-talk me.\\
150 - Okay, look, we're not going
to find this stupid ring anyway,\\
151 - so let's just get out of here.\\
152 - Where's Fez?\\
153 - Well, Goldie,\\
154 - it seems that we're lost
in a dark, cold, lonely cave.\\
155 - You look scared, too.\\
156 - Your eyes are
bugging out of your head.\\
157 - But I'm glad you're here.\\
158 - 'Cause at least I can have
a conversation with a fish.\\
159 - Otherwise I'd be losing my mind.\\
160 - Fez?\\
161 - - Where is he?
- Oh, don't worry.\\
162 - He survived his trip over here in a
banana crate, he'll be fine in the woods.\\
163 - Actually, I'm kind
of worried about him.\\
164 - It's dark, it's cold, there's
no pornography anywhere.\\
165 - What was that?\\
166 - That was a wild Canadian boar.\\
167 - They feed on likeable girls.\\
168 - You're safe.\\
169 - You know, being out here like
this, without any TV or magazines,\\
170 - you know, makes me realize how
people 500 years ago must have felt.\\
171 - Incredibly bored.\\
172 - By the way, Donna, if you're
ever lost in the outdoors,\\
173 - just find the North Star.\\
174 - Its gentle twinkling will
comfort you as you slowly die.\\
175 - Oh. Ew!\\
176 - What, now we have to cross
a disgusting river?\\
177 - Jackie, it's just a creek.\\
178 - Okay, fine. Why don't
you take your shoe off,\\
179 - we'll all get in and
row ourselves across.\\
180 - - Allow me, milady.
- Thank you.\\
181 - Wait, how am I
supposed to get across?\\
182 - Come across like you
always do. Real bitchy.\\
183 - Oh. Okay, you know what?\\
184 - Even when we were dating, you
never did the gentlemanly thing.\\
185 - All right, fine,
give me your hand.\\
186 - No, I am not touching that hand.\\
187 - You have been burping
in that hand all day.\\
188 - Come on, you've touched
grosser things than this.\\
189 - You went out with
Kelso for four years.\\
190 - Oh.\\
191 - Okay, you know what,
I'll just get myself across.\\
192 - Well, that couldn't have
worked out any better.\\
193 - Well, Goldie, if my internal
clock is correct,\\
194 - we've been here either
an hour, or a month.\\
195 - Man, I'm terribly thirsty.\\
196 - Hope you don't mind, I'm going
to drink a little bit of your water.\\
197 - You peed in there.\\
198 - Well, I made Bob
go and get the kids.\\
199 - Maybe they'll find the ring, maybe
not, either way, I got rid of Bob.\\
200 - I can't believe you lied to me
about that ring.\\
201 - Listen, Kitty.\\
202 - When I got back from Korea,\\
203 - I wanted to buy you the
nicest engagement ring ever.\\
204 - But I wasn't making much money.\\
205 - And when I realized how long I
would have to save to get that ring,\\
206 - I just knew I couldn't wait that
long to ask you to marry me.\\
207 - Well, that's true.
I had other offers.\\
208 - Jimmy Callahan used to call me
"sweet knees" and he was absolutely right.\\
209 - So, I bought the best that I could
afford and I was going to tell you\\
210 - that we'd get a better ring
when we had the money.\\
211 - But then it all went wrong.\\
212 - You loved the ring, you said it must've
cost $1,000 and you were so excited.\\
213 - I just couldn't let you down.\\
214 - Red.\\
215 - But I'll tell you what.\\
216 - If the kids don't find the old
one, I'll get you another ring.\\
217 - The kind that you deserve for
putting up with me all these years.\\
218 - Well, I don't want
you to sell the house.\\
219 - Hey, Donna, you know when you see
a flock of ducks flying in a "V" formation,\\
220 - one side looks longer than
the other, you know why that is?\\
221 - - No?
- More ducks.\\
222 - Hey, we lost Jackie and Hyde.\\
223 - Finally we're alone.\\
224 - Donna!\\
225 - - That was magical.
- Yeah. I hope I didn't get pregnant.\\
226 - Donna!\\
227 - Hey, you guys missed it!
Jackie just fell in the creek.\\
228 - Will you shut up?
I can get pneumonia and die.\\
229 - This keeps getting funnier.\\
230 - All right, we still need to find Fez,
so why don't the girls stay here,\\
231 - Hyde and I go look for him?\\
232 - I have a better idea.
Let's get some meatball subs\\
233 - and go to a strip club.\\
234 - Come on,
buddy, let's go find Fez.\\
235 - Maybe Fez has a meatball sub!\\
236 - Okay, I have been holding this in for,
like, three hours and I can't do it anymore.\\
237 - Yeah, I know. You like Randy, you're
jealous of my hair. Blah, blah, blah.\\
238 - No, I drank too much, and now I
have to, like, go, so be my lookout.\\
239 - You know, if this were a mall,
you'd be in a bathroom right now.\\
240 - Of course,
you wouldn't be in a mall,\\
241 - 'cause you might accidentally
put on some new clothes.\\
242 - Hey, man, this looks familiar. I
think we just made a complete circle.\\
243 - - Whoa!
- Oh, my God!\\
244 - No, I'd remember this!\\
245 - I win again!\\
246 - I know you're just a fish,
but come on, at least try!\\
247 - Fez, is that you?\\
248 - Goldie, you can use pronouns?\\
249 - No, Fez, it's me, Bob.\\
250 - Bob! You found us! Hallelujah!\\
251 - Yep, just followed the trail
of candy corn you left.\\
252 - What? I didn't leave a...
Oh, damn it! There was a hole.\\
253 - All that candy corn wasted.\\
254 - No, I ate them.\\
255 - Bob, they were on the ground!\\
256 - Well,
I would have done the same.\\
257 - Donna, you don't have to be
embarrassed, man. It's over.\\
258 - Nobody cares.\\
259 - In fact, hey, let's all sing a little
campfire song, all right? I'll start.\\
260 - Tinkle, tinkle, little star
Donna wees behind a bush\\
261 - I just couldn't hold it anymore.\\
262 - Why did I get the 48-ounce
commemorative cup?\\
263 - Why didn't I go in the
48-ounce commemorative cup?\\
264 - I'm not sure that relieving
yourself in a cup\\
265 - would've made this
any less humiliating.\\
266 - You know, this...
This is why I hate the woods.\\
267 - Everything's a bathroom.
God, it's just like Delaware.\\
268 - Oh, that reminds me of an
old Delawarean folk song.\\
269 - Donna squatted in a bush
Pee-pee, doo-doo\\
270 - Donna squatted in a bush
Pee-pee all day long\\
271 - Oh, when the saints
Oh, when the saints\\
272 - Go marching in
Go marching in\\
273 - Oh, when
the saints go marching in\\
274 - Dad?\\
275 - Oh, Lord,
I want to be in that number\\
276 - When
the saints go marching in\\
277 - Oh, when the saints...\\
278 - My dad and Fez are skipping
through the woods.\\
279 - And I peed on a bush.\\
280 - I really
should've gone to college.\\
281 - Come on, Jackie, I'll
help you across the creek.\\
282 - - Would you just
leave me alone?
- Want to fall in again?\\
283 - Fine.\\
284 - Steven!\\
285 - Man, I hope I remember this
in the morning.\\
286 - Yeah, it's too bad the
kids never found your ring.\\
287 - But on the up side...
Pork Doodles!\\
288 - Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, it's my ring!\\
289 - It was in
the car the whole time!\\
290 - That's great. It's like I always
say, sometimes you find things.\\
291 - - Kitty!
- Red!\\
292 - I just ordered you a new ring.\\
293 - The diamond is almost a karat,
the band is white gold,\\
294 - the jeweler said
it was the nicest one he had.\\
295 - Oh.\\
296 - Well, that sounds beautiful.\\
297 - I know it won't have all the
sentimental value of the old one, but...\\
298 - ...but that ring
is gone forever.\\
299 - Goldie, it's not right to keep
you in a tiny bag like this.\\
300 - A goldfish belongs in the wild.\\
301 - It's never easy to say
goodbye. Especially to a fish.\\
302 - 'Cause I'm not sure
where your ears are.\\
303 - Here you go.\\
304 - Swim, Goldie! Swim!\\
305 - Fly, Goldie! Fly!
\subsection {Episode 16: My Fairy King}
1 - Hey, Fez.\\
2 - Hey, girl holding Fez's hand who
I've never seen before in my life.\\
3 - - Everyone, meet Hilary. My girlfriend.
- Hi, guys.\\
4 - Is she really
your girlfriend, Fez?\\
5 - Or did you just find her wandering
from the scene of an accident\\
6 - and tell her
she's your girlfriend?\\
7 - No, this one's legit.
See, no scratches.\\
8 - Um, a little privacy, please?\\
9 - You want privacy?\\
10 - - You spy on me and
Randy all the time.
- Donna, I like to watch.\\
11 - I don't like being watched.
That's just creepy.\\
12 - No, creepy is when you open the
closet door and throw a shoe at me\\
13 - and tell me to get out of the way so
you can get a better view of Donna.\\
14 - - Hey. Um, I'm looking for Samantha.
- Who are you?\\
15 - I'm her husband.\\
16 - Sam!\\
17 - - Larry?
- Samantha.\\
18 - Uh, this guy just
said he is your husband\\
19 - which is a little off-putting
because I'm your husband.\\
20 - I can explain this.\\
21 - You're both my husband.\\
22 - Wow, Hyde. I bet when
you married a stripper\\
23 - this wasn't the kind of
threesome you expected.\\
24 - Hanging out\\
25 - Down the street\\
26 - The same old thing\\
27 - We did last week\\
28 - Not a thing to do\\
29 - But talk to you\\
30 - We're all all right\\
31 - We're all all right\\
32 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
33 - So when you and I got married, you
were already married to another guy?\\
34 - Sort of.\\
35 - Sort of? There is no
"sort of" in marriage.\\
36 - When you say, "I do," you
mean, "I do want to marry you,"\\
37 - not, "I do already
have another husband!"\\
38 - Hey, everybody,
Hyde's part of a boy-harem!\\
39 - Look, Hyde, Larry was a regular at the
club and one day he asked me to marry him.\\
40 - He said he'd rent me an
apartment and buy me a Camaro,\\
41 - what was I supposed to say?\\
42 - How about, "No, you
creepy 80-year-old loser"?\\
43 - Hey, nobody talks to
Larry Lennet like that.\\
44 - - Shut up, Larry.
- I'm sorry, dear.\\
45 - Then I met you
and I fell in love.\\
46 - I figured we'd just leave town
and I'd never see him again.\\
47 - Luckily for me,
you kept using my credit card,\\
48 - which expires in a month. I
got you a new one in the car.\\
49 - So, if she was married to him
before she married you,\\
50 - then you guys aren't
even legally married,\\
51 - which means this is
freaking hilarious!\\
52 - Red, I just heard
some bad news, I ran over to tell you.\\
53 - Bob, you live next door,
why are you panting?\\
54 - I was going against the wind.\\
55 - They're opening a Muffler
Master right here in Point Place!\\
56 - - What?
- Aw, jeez.\\
57 - My shop is barely
scraping by as it is.\\
58 - Muffler Master isn't going
to drive you out of town.\\
59 - They're a big chain.\\
60 - They're always throwing
their weight around,\\
61 - crushing anything
smaller than themselves.\\
62 - They're like Bob at a Cub
Scout pancake breakfast.\\
63 - Well, they are just
a faceless corporation.\\
64 - You have something they don't. A
friendly smiling face behind the counter.\\
65 - When did you hire a new guy?\\
66 - This town needs to know\\
67 - that there is a friendly neighborhood
muffler man they can go to.\\
68 - So you should have a sale.\\
69 - No, a sale-a-bration!\\
70 - I'll make muffins. You can
give one away with each muffler.\\
71 - Just don't sell
more than 12 mufflers\\
72 - because Jody Adelman
still has my other tin.\\
73 - - See you later, alligator.
- After a while,
you big baboon.\\
74 - Unbelievable.
God, Fez has Hilary,\\
75 - you have Randy, now
Steven's wife has two husbands.\\
76 - Why am I alone and all you stupid,
less attractive people are happy?\\
77 - Ugly people need love, too.\\
78 - Just like bitches.\\
79 - Okay, I need a boyfriend.\\
80 - But I don't want to end up with
someone as stupid as Michael\\
81 - or someone as
wrong for me as Steven.\\
82 - I know.
I'm gonna write up a list.\\
83 - Write down everything I want in a man
and then find the guy who matches up!\\
84 - I did that once.
But with candy.\\
85 - Okay. What do I want in a guy?\\
86 - Ah, Olympic gold medalist,\\
87 - someone who
doesn't talk to the help.\\
88 - Oh, doesn't look like Eric.\\
89 - Jackie, if you're
serious about this list,\\
90 - maybe you should pick qualities
that are a little more realistic?\\
91 - Ah, you're right.
Yeah, you're right.\\
92 - No fatties, no baldies.\\
93 - What are you still doing here?\\
94 - I thought you'd be halfway to
Vegas by now with your husband.\\
95 - You're my husband.\\
96 - No. I'm the guy you married
'cause you were bored.\\
97 - Next time,
try tennis, you lunatic.\\
98 - Hey. That's our wife
you're talking about.\\
99 - - Shut up, Larry.
- I'm sorry.\\
100 - Hyde, for what it's worth,
I don't love Larry.\\
101 - - I love you.
- Oh. Great.\\
102 - You love me more than
you love your grandfather.\\
103 - Well, I'll have you know I
won't be going without a fight.\\
104 - - Shut up, Larry!
- Without a fight it is.\\
105 - Oh, Red, I am sorry
business is so slow.\\
106 - I blame myself. I used margarine
instead of butter in the muffins.\\
107 - I ruined us to save 8 cents!\\
108 - Red, I told you,
you should listen to me.\\
109 - I'm not renting
a promotional monkey.\\
110 - No. No, Red, you should've turned
this place into an adult bookstore.\\
111 - Those places are
packed 24 hours a day.\\
112 - Sometimes you can't even get
to the good stuff.\\
113 - Oh, oh, Red, a customer.
Okay, now, you show him\\
114 - that you have the personal
touch that Muffler Master doesn't.\\
115 - And if that doesn't work,
tell him you have a fake leg.\\
116 - There is an orderly at the
hospital who has a fake leg\\
117 - and he just gets
whatever he wants.\\
118 - - Can I help you?
- Yeah, I need a muffler.\\
119 - And I appreciate your business.\\
120 - I mean, sure, Muffler Master can give
you half off, but here at Forman and Son,\\
121 - you get personalized
home-town service with a smile.\\
122 - Half off?
What am I doing here?\\
123 - Hey, what about my
damn service with a smile?\\
124 - I have a fake leg!\\
125 - Okay, okay, stop everything!\\
126 - I've finished my
"perfect man" list!\\
127 - And all the pieces of my life
are falling into place.\\
128 - Oh, would you just shush and listen?
Okay, first, he has to be a gentleman.\\
129 - Just like my Fezzie. He's
always opening doors for me.\\
130 - Well, that way, I can walk in
behind her and the view is better.\\
131 - Okay, my ideal guy
has a great sense of humor.\\
132 - Oh, that's like Fez, too!\\
133 - Just this morning, he told me
the funniest knock-knock joke.\\
134 - I'd tell it, but I don't want
to get us off-track\\
135 - with 10 minutes of
uproarious laughter.\\
136 - Okay, and third, he has to be
interested in women's shoes.\\
137 - Oh, Fez, that's like last night
when you put on my heels...\\
138 - Anywho...\\
139 - Okay.\\
140 - Okay, well, I'll let you guys
hash this out on your own.\\
141 - Baby,
some stories are just for us.\\
142 - Jackie, have you realized who
fits every single thing on your list?\\
143 - Yeah! Elton John!\\
144 - And I think he's single, 'cause
you never see him out with a girl.\\
145 - No, I'm talking about Fez.\\
146 - - What?
- Hey, you wrote the list\\
147 - and the list don't lie.
And your ideal man is Fez!\\
148 - Oh... That is almost
as ridiculous as you\\
149 - looking in the mirror and
thinking this outfit works.\\
150 - Oh, yeah?\\
151 - At least I can see over the
bathroom counter to look in the mirror.\\
152 - Oh, hey, you know what? I found
a perfect dress for you that'll fit you.\\
153 - Ah, you're gonna have to
borrow it from the Statue of Liberty.\\
154 - Okay, truce. I didn't mean to upset
you. Let's just stop and call it even.\\
155 - Okay, fine.\\
156 - You like Fez,
you like Fez.\\
157 - Today was a total disaster.\\
158 - I didn't sell one muffler
and I drove a dozen customers\\
159 - into the hands
of my competition.\\
160 - If I were a younger, more flexible
man, I'd shove my foot up my own ass.\\
161 - You think you got problems?
I've got a husband-in-law.\\
162 - Okay, well, this should cheer
the two of you up.\\
163 - My secret seven-layer casserole.\\
164 - The secret is layers
three and six are bourbon.\\
165 - I can't go back out on the job
market. It's a young man's game.\\
166 - Plus I hate everybody.\\
167 - Well, maybe you should think
about retiring.\\
168 - You're always saying
how you'd love more time\\
169 - to drive around town and
yell at men who wear sandals.\\
170 - I can't afford to retire.
That's it.\\
171 - I'm not waiting for those
bastards to put me out of business.\\
172 - I'm going down to the Muffler Masters
offices and give them a piece of my mind.\\
173 - What if they tell you
to go take a flying leap?\\
174 - Well, then, I'll throw a garbage
can through their window.\\
175 - So basically, Jackie's list says
the perfect man for her is Fez,\\
176 - but she's in massive denial.\\
177 - Jackie, it's not
healthy to be in denial.\\
178 - Once my uncle came to terms
with his crush on Burt Reynolds,\\
179 - a whole new world
opened up for him.\\
180 - Okay, look, just because Fez
matches up with a few things on my list\\
181 - doesn't mean he is the
perfect match for me.\\
182 - I mean, we are complete opposites.
It's like I'm Beauty and he is the Beast.\\
183 - Um, Jackie, at the end of the story,
Beauty and the Beast get together.\\
184 - Oh, would you
shut up, you reader?\\
185 - Look, there are plenty of other
things on this list. For instance,\\
186 - my perfect guy compliments me,
buys me presents and comes when I call.\\
187 - And none of that describes Fez.\\
188 - Did you call me?\\
189 - - What? No, I...
- Wow, Jackie,
you look fantastic today.\\
190 - Oh, which reminds me,
I got you a present.\\
191 - Enjoy it. Bye, guys!\\
192 - Whoa, that was weird.\\
193 - So have you decided what
you are gonna do about Sam?\\
194 - I don't know, man.\\
195 - I mean, on one hand, she
kept a massive secret from me,\\
196 - and I don't think I
can ever trust her again.\\
197 - On the other hand,\\
198 - I'm just a small-town burn-out
with two stints in juvie.\\
199 - Who am I to judge?\\
200 - Well, all I know is,
she makes you happy.\\
201 - And the only other time I've
seen such a big smile on your face\\
202 - was when you got Fez and Kelso
to smash their heads together\\
203 - when you threw
a peanut on the floor.\\
204 - It's a tough decision, man.
I'm gonna let the ball decide.\\
205 - If I make the shot, I stay with
Sam. If I miss, I say goodbye.\\
206 - Huh. God's funny.\\
207 - Kitty, I just got back from the
Muffler Master offices in Kenosha.\\
208 - Oh, I hate Kenosha. They think
they're so much better than us\\
209 - just because
they've got a town pool.\\
210 - Yeah. Well, I told them,\\
211 - no matter how many mom-and-pop
stores they put out of business,\\
212 - they'd better not even think
about opening a store near mine\\
213 - or they'll get a fight from me
like they've never seen!\\
214 - That's my man!
What did they say?\\
215 - They're putting a store
across the street.\\
216 - Oh, Red, I'm sorry.\\
217 - Ah, don't be. I scared
the heck out of them.\\
218 - They even offered me
a little money for my shop.\\
219 - Well, I hope you
told them to get lost.\\
220 - Course I did. Then they
offered me more money.\\
221 - And you told them to stuff it.\\
222 - Damn right. And then they
offered me a lot of money.\\
223 - - Go to hell, Muffler Master.
- Actually, I accepted it.\\
224 - Thank you, Muffler Master!\\
225 - Oh.\\
226 - Oh, I can't believe this.\\
227 - Yeah, me neither.\\
228 - But you know, I've been thinking
about what you said, about retiring.\\
229 - And I think that, with this
check, we can just about do it.\\
230 - If it's okay with you.\\
231 - Oh, Red. You don't have to ask
my permission for anything.\\
232 - You have fought in two wars,
you have worked your whole life.\\
233 - You deserve to cash in.\\
234 - Well, I couldn't have done it
without my best gal!\\
235 - Well, speaking of things you
can't do without your best gal...\\
236 - Hmm.\\
237 - How'd you like to go celebrate?\\
238 - I was thinking the same thing!\\
239 - Oh! You meant...\\
240 - Well, sure,
we can get a steak later!\\
241 - Doesn't it bother you that Muffler
Master is going to turn your shop\\
242 - into a parking lot?\\
243 - As long as that check clears,\\
244 - I don't care if they turn it into
a Communist recreation center.\\
245 - Anyway,
what happened to you and Sam?\\
246 - Oh, well. We finally got
some time alone, we talked,\\
247 - I told her I thought it'd be a
mistake if we stayed together,\\
248 - she agreed and we hugged.\\
249 - Then she jumped back on the
main stage and finished out her act.\\
250 - Well, you two kids lasted
longer than I expected.\\
251 - I thought she was gonna knock you out
and steal your wallet on the first night.\\
252 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
253 - Thought you'd be
halfway to Vegas by now.\\
254 - Hyde, I'm really sorry
how things worked out.\\
255 - Yeah, me, too.\\
256 - But I like to think if our paths ever cross
again that I'd be able to give you $20\\
257 - and you'd be able to dance for
me and it wouldn't be awkward.\\
258 - I'd like that.\\
259 - - Bye.
- See ya.\\
260 - - You all right?
- Yeah.\\
261 - Let me tell you something, son.
I dodged a lot of bullets in Korea,\\
262 - but not one as crazy and blonde
as the one that you just side-stepped.\\
263 - It's weird, man.\\
264 - I never imagined myself
divorced from a Vegas stripper\\
265 - with a second
husband at this age.\\
266 - I never imagined
myself retired at this age.\\
267 - But all I know is, when life finally
gives you a break from the crap storm,\\
268 - the best thing that you can do is
to crack open a beer with a friend.\\
269 - - To retirement.
- To divorce.\\
270 - You know, Red,
retirement is gonna be great.\\
271 - Sleeping in every day,
watching TV, doing nothing.\\
272 - I'd be happy to
show you how it's done.\\
273 - Beauty!\\
274 - Beast! I like your haircut.\\
275 - Oh, thank you for noticing.\\
276 - Yeah, I had them take off
a little extra off the wrists.\\
277 - So what brings you up
to the forest of no return?\\
278 - Oh, see, I wrote up this list of
who my perfect match should be,\\
279 - and everyone thinks it's you.\\
280 - I mean, isn't that crazy?
You're a beast!\\
281 - That's true, I'm disgusting.\\
282 - Yeah! Oh, yeah, you actually
have a little piece of elf right here.\\
283 - Did I get it?\\
284 - No, no, here, come here. Ah.\\
285 - Uh-uh!\\
286 - Okay. Well,
I'll see you later, Beast.\\
287 - Beast! You're totally hot!\\
288 - Holy crap! I'm going to
save a fortune on razors!\\
289 - Why, you're not a beast at
all! You're a handsome prince.\\
290 - The list was right.
You are the one for me.\\
291 - Then come and get the
royal treatment, baby!\\
292 - Jackie? Jackie! Are you okay?\\
293 - You were moaning in your
sleep, and while I find it enjoyable,\\
294 - I thought I should wake you up.\\
295 - I'm fine. No,
I'm fine, it's just, um...\\
296 - Fez?
Get back in here, you beast!\\
297 - Oh, coming, my Beauty!\\
298 - - Hi, honey, how was your day?
- Great, great.\\
299 - I scared an entire village and I
tore down all the trees in the forest.\\
300 - What's for dinner?\\
301 - - I made you a special dish.
- Macaroni and children?\\
302 - Italian! My favorite!\\
303 - I do smell good.
Hey, save me a piece of me!
\subsection {Episode 17: Crazy Little Thing Called Love}
1 - Steven, why is there lingerie
behind my canned goods?\\
2 - Oh, sorry, that's Sam's.\\
3 - Before we split up, our
love life got a little boring\\
4 - so we decided to branch out
and try some new locations.\\
5 - By the way,
this is a good, sturdy table.\\
6 - Oh, Steven!\\
7 - Good morning.\\
8 - Hi, Red. You're up early.\\
9 - You're retired.
You should be sleeping in.\\
10 - Yeah, well, I was awoken
by the pleasant sound of birds\\
11 - chirping outside my window.\\
12 - And now that I don't have to work,
I finally have time to poison them.\\
13 - I feed those birds bread
every day.\\
14 - Good. That'll make it easier.\\
15 - Red, I don't think you have
embraced retirement yet.\\
16 - What you need to do
is get yourself a robe,\\
17 - go sit out on the porch,
then shake your fists\\
18 - and yell stuff like,
"Dagnabit! Why I ought to..."\\
19 - I have to say,
I looked forward to retirement\\
20 - as much as I looked forward
to playing catch with my son.\\
21 - And both of them have left me
bitterly disappointed.\\
22 - Well, you know,
we could take a trip.\\
23 - When Amy O'Brian's
husband retired,\\
24 - they went to see the nutcracker
museum in Rhode Island.\\
25 - We don't have to go
anywhere that fancy,\\
26 - but there is that cave in West
Virginia I've been wanting to see.\\
27 - That's a good idea, Red.
You and Kitty you should travel.\\
28 - You know, see the world.\\
29 - I saw the world when I was
in the Navy. It shot at me.\\
30 - I don't know. West Virginia is
supposed to be pretty nice.\\
31 - It is the Ohio of
the Atlantic states.\\
32 - Well, if you need
something to do,\\
33 - you can always come down
to help me at the record store.\\
34 - There's a light switch
that keeps shocking people.\\
35 - Although on the upside, the jolts
seem to be making Leo remember stuff.\\
36 - Yeah, sure, I'll help you out. It'll
be good to get out of the house.\\
37 - If I have to listen to Phil
Donahue, tell one more housewife\\
38 - that it isn't her fault
that her life is messed up,\\
39 - I'm going to drive to Chicago and
hit him in the head with a hammer.\\
40 - Okay, Donna, I have something to
admit to you but it's really embarrassing.\\
41 - You read a book for pleasure?\\
42 - Um...\\
43 - I like Fez.\\
44 - Wow.\\
45 - Well, I guess the only
thing I have to say is\\
46 - I freaking knew it!\\
47 - Donna! Look, I know I made up
that stupid list to figure out\\
48 - who my perfect match
should be, and you were right.\\
49 - It's Fez.\\
50 - This is one of the biggest
things I've ever heard you say.\\
51 - I know, I know.
I can't believe I like him.\\
52 - No, you admitted I was right.\\
53 - Okay, are you sure you like Fez?\\
54 - I mean,\\
55 - think about all the things you've
said about him over the years.\\
56 - He's a bad... Poor...
Sweaty... Stinky... Crazy...\\
57 - Sick... Ridiculous...
Foreign... Spazoid... Weirdo.\\
58 - Okay, all right, Donna.
You busted me.\\
59 - I like a bad, poor, sweaty, stinky, crazy,
ridiculous, sick, foreign, spazoid weirdo.\\
60 - Hey, luscious ladies.\\
61 - Hey, Fez.\\
62 - Hey, Fez. What's up?\\
63 - Well, I made up a new way
to play Candyland\\
64 - where I will eat the appropriate
candy for each square I land on.\\
65 - So, Jackie, get ready to come home to
a candy-covered, pantsless roommate.\\
66 - Wait. Why do you have to
take your pants off to play?\\
67 - You don't know me at all!\\
68 - There he goes, Jackie.\\
69 - Your candy-covered,
pantsless Prince Charming.\\
70 - Hanging out\\
71 - Down the street\\
72 - The same old thing\\
73 - We did last week\\
74 - Not a thing to do\\
75 - But talk to you\\
76 - We're all all right\\
77 - We're all all right\\
78 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
79 - Fez, now that I'm spending
so much time here,\\
80 - maybe you should get a waterbed.\\
81 - That way we won't keep
Jackie up with all the squeaking.\\
82 - Yeah, sorry about that.\\
83 - I'm a squeaker.\\
84 - Oh, Donna, I like a squeaker.\\
85 - Well, what am I going to do?\\
86 - Okay, look.\\
87 - A few years ago,
I went to see a therapist.\\
88 - Loser!\\
89 - My parents were going through
their divorce and it helped.\\
90 - Not everyone who goes to
a therapist is a loser.\\
91 - Okay, wait. So, you're saying
this therapist actually helped you?\\
92 - Yeah.\\
93 - Well, he must be pretty good if he
convinced you you're not a loser...\\
94 - Wow, man. Impressive.\\
95 - Yeah. Mr. Forman is really
good at fixing stuff.\\
96 - No, six across. "Impressive."\\
97 - No, wait, that's
more than three letters.\\
98 - There you go.\\
99 - Oh, nice job, Red.\\
100 - Only problem is now I can
see how dirty everything is.\\
101 - I got to do
something about that.\\
102 - There you go.\\
103 - All right, man, thanks.
Guess I'll see you later.\\
104 - Actually I thought I'd fix
that wobbly chair before I left.\\
105 - Take a hike, cop-head.\\
106 - Hey, quiet!\\
107 - Oh, sorry, it's quilt.\\
108 - Sorry.\\
109 - I'm just saying I can't believe
I'm in a therapist's office.\\
110 - I mean, there is no way I'll
be able to talk for a whole hour.\\
111 - Well, thank you, Dr. Hammond.\\
112 - You're right.\\
113 - I am pretty and I am special.\\
114 - And I am in the wrong office.\\
115 - Wow, that was a tough hour.\\
116 - Come on in, girls.\\
117 - Have a seat, huh. Excuse me.\\
118 - Hello?\\
119 - Oh, hello, Helen.\\
120 - Fine!
I'll heat up my own dinner.\\
121 - God knows you haven't heated
up anything in our home in months.\\
122 - But have a great time, huh.\\
123 - So. Donna,
nice to see you again.\\
124 - How are your folks?\\
125 - Oh, you know, still crazy.\\
126 - You're telling me,
they paid for my watch.\\
127 - And you must be Jackie.\\
128 - Yeah. Oh, but before you think
there is anything wrong with me,\\
129 - you see, I'm only here
because I like this boy\\
130 - and I don't want
to like him, so...\\
131 - You know, if you could just
write a prescription for that,\\
132 - I'll be on my way.\\
133 - Do you see how messed up she is?\\
134 - Still eating your cuticles?\\
135 - No.\\
136 - Jackie, first tell me
about some of the other men\\
137 - that you had feelings for.\\
138 - Okay. Well, there's Michael,
who cheated on me.\\
139 - And then there's Steven,\\
140 - who would rather vandalize a
car than commit to a relationship.\\
141 - And now there's Fez,\\
142 - who's been after me for years
and is really very sweet,\\
143 - but I never paid any attention to
him 'cause, you know, he's foreign.\\
144 - Wow. He seems like a fine man.\\
145 - Or at least he is now.\\
146 - Before you get your sadistic
female claws into him\\
147 - and make him forget
that he is even a man at all.\\
148 - Okay, well,
none of this matters anyway\\
149 - because, of course, now that
I like Fez, he has a girlfriend.\\
150 - Have you ever considered that
you only like unavailable men?\\
151 - I mean, the others
were emotionally unavailable.\\
152 - But you weren't interested
in Fez until he was taken.\\
153 - Wow.\\
154 - So I don't really like Fez,\\
155 - I just think I like him
'cause he has a girlfriend?\\
156 - Do you see how
messed up she is, Doctor?\\
157 - I mean she's got
some real issues.\\
158 - I notice you dyed your hair.\\
159 - What are you running away from?\\
160 - I just want people to like me!\\
161 - Jackie, just remember
that whoever you end up with,\\
162 - the key to any relationship
is good communication.\\
163 - Excuse me.\\
164 - Hello?\\
165 - Helen!\\
166 - I told you I'd move it
as soon as Al can help me.\\
167 - Well, I wish you had more
upper body strength!\\
168 - No, you are!\\
169 - No, you are!\\
170 - Go to hell, you cow!\\
171 - So...\\
172 - Yes.\\
173 - Good communication.\\
174 - That's the key.\\
175 - Why is the closed
sign on the door?\\
176 - Oh, Red put that up.\\
177 - He said I could either have
a closed sign on the door,\\
178 - or an open sign on my ass.\\
179 - I should never have asked him
to come down, man.\\
180 - He is bad for business.\\
181 - You think that's
bad for business?\\
182 - I've been stealing
money for months.\\
183 - Red?\\
184 - Red!\\
185 - Hey, man,
why are you working so hard?\\
186 - You should be enjoying
your retirement, you know.\\
187 - Yeah, there's still
plenty to do here.\\
188 - The hinge on that office door is
busted, the window needs caulking\\
189 - and that back room
is such a mess,\\
190 - you got a bunch of weeds
growing in there.\\
191 - Look, man, why don't you
just call it a day, you know?\\
192 - You're retired, it's 2:00.\\
193 - Hey, it's almost dinner time.\\
194 - Are you kicking me out?\\
195 - No. You know...\\
196 - Yeah.\\
197 - Look, why...
Why don't you just go home.\\
198 - I don't believe this!\\
199 - He seemed mad.\\
200 - Good thing you never have to
see him again.\\
201 - Uh-oh!\\
202 - Fez! Great news!\\
203 - I have an opportunity to do something
that is going to make me incredibly happy.\\
204 - - Oh, that is wonderful!
- I'm going to become a nun!\\
205 - You selfish whore!\\
206 - Listen,
I join the convent next week.\\
207 - So, I'm sorry.\\
208 - But, if it makes you feel any better,
you're the last man to ever touch me.\\
209 - Unless, I meet someone in
Italy before I take my vows.\\
210 - See you.\\
211 - Hey, Fez. What's going on?\\
212 - Hilary broke up with me.\\
213 - Oh, my God.\\
214 - Yeah, I just need someone to
hold me and tell me it's all right.\\
215 - I got to go find Hyde!\\
216 - I am pretty.\\
217 - I am special.\\
218 - My casserole is not too oniony.\\
219 - Hey.\\
220 - Oh, Steven.
I need to talk to you.\\
221 - How could you kick
Red out of your store?\\
222 - I wasn't expecting
him home so early\\
223 - and he walked in on me taking
a bath without any bubbles.\\
224 - There goes the mystery!\\
225 - I'm sorry, Mrs. Forman,
he was in the way.\\
226 - In the way?\\
227 - When your parents left you
and we took you in,\\
228 - did we say you were in the way?\\
229 - No! We fed you and loved you\\
230 - and we let you into our Sears
family portrait.\\
231 - Look, I asked him to
fix one little switch.\\
232 - The next thing I know, he is
pounding and swearing and sweating.\\
233 - It's like
watching Fez eat a cake.\\
234 - Well, you need to find a way
to make Red feel useful.\\
235 - And you know what
else you need to find?\\
236 - A beige cardigan, because
that's what we're wearing\\
237 - in this year's picture.\\
238 - And I don't want to hear
about how it's not cool.\\
239 - I just want you to put the damn thing
on, smile and say freaking cheese.\\
240 - Jackie, what is it about me
that makes every woman leave?\\
241 - I'm going to die alone with nothing
but a room full of candy and pornography\\
242 - to keep me company.\\
243 - Although, as I say that,
it sounds okay.\\
244 - Oh, okay. Look, Fez, you're
not... You're not going to die alone.\\
245 - Yes, I am.
I'm a foreign weirdo.\\
246 - No, no. You have fascinating
stories about faraway lands.\\
247 - I scare women away
with my clinginess.\\
248 - But when someone needs you,
you're always there.\\
249 - People can barely
understand a word I say.\\
250 - Well, yes,
but that's a good thing,\\
251 - because sometimes
you say really stupid things.\\
252 - Uh, okay, look, Fez,
you're a great guy, okay.\\
253 - You're funny and you're cute.\\
254 - And any girl would
be lucky to have you.\\
255 - Oh, Jackie, you're so sweet.\\
256 - Why can't I find
a woman like you who likes me?\\
257 - I got to go!\\
258 - Well, if I watch some TV,
I'll feel better.\\
259 - And now,
Masterpiece Theater presents\\
260 - A Lonely Foreigner.\\
261 - Hyde, I don't get it.\\
262 - We're going to
destroy Mr. Forman's house\\
263 - and that's supposed to
make him feel better?\\
264 - Yeah.\\
265 - Then he can fix everything
and feel really useful.\\
266 - Red will be
happier than the time\\
267 - he chased off those deadheads
camping in the park.\\
268 - Well, you can't camp there, man.\\
269 - Some bald guy chases you off.\\
270 - I just ripped this
right off the furnace.\\
271 - I busted that TV.\\
272 - I totally destroyed
the washing machine, man.\\
273 - Oh, hey, Red.\\
274 - I'm glad you're here, man. Things
are just falling apart down here.\\
275 - It's freezing in my room
and the TV is broken and\\
276 - this thing just popped right
out of the washing machine.\\
277 - Jeez, I'm gone for one day
and the whole house goes to hell.\\
278 - Yeah. It's a good thing you're here,
though, so you can fix everything.\\
279 - You know what?\\
280 - I'll get to this stuff later.\\
281 - Later?\\
282 - Yeah, I was thinking about what you
said this afternoon at the record store.\\
283 - You're right. I do deserve to slow
down and enjoy my retirement.\\
284 - So, right now,
I'm going fishing.\\
285 - Yeah, but it's,
like, 10 degrees in my room!\\
286 - Can I at least call a repairman?\\
287 - Sure.
But you're paying for it.\\
288 - I'm on a fixed income.\\
289 - I'm retired.\\
290 - This is bad.\\
291 - We destroyed everything.\\
292 - On the bright side,
I don't live here.\\
293 - What am I going to do, man? I can't
watch TV, I can't sleep in my room.\\
294 - I guess I can
drag my bed out here.\\
295 - Hyde, man, wait till you see
what I did to your bed!\\
296 - Okay, Donna,
I don't know what to do.\\
297 - I thought I only liked Fez
because he was unavailable.\\
298 - But now he's available
and I still like him.\\
299 - I mean, I almost kissed him!\\
300 - On the mouth!\\
301 - He eats couscous
with that thing!\\
302 - Okay, before I tell you what to
do, let me just get one thing straight.\\
303 - You really like Fez?\\
304 - Fez is the one you like?\\
305 - Yes.\\
306 - So you want to go
out on dates with Fez?\\
307 - And make out with Fez?\\
308 - - Yes!
- Okay.\\
309 - Its Christmas morning, you
get up and your gift is Fez!\\
310 - - Donna!
- Sorry.\\
311 - All right, well, look, I mean,
if you really like him,\\
312 - you're going to
have to tell him.\\
313 - I know.
You're right. You're right.\\
314 - Hey.\\
315 - - Hey.
- Hey.\\
316 - Hey.
So, uh, I hear you like Fez.\\
317 - What? How did you hear that?\\
318 - Since we weren't trapped
in a soundproof lead box,\\
319 - we were able to hear your
delicate voice from across the street.\\
320 - All right. Okay, I know you
guys probably think I'm crazy\\
321 - and I'm going from guy to guy.\\
322 - But Fez has always been there for me
and he makes me feel good about myself.\\
323 - So, go ahead,
go, go make fun of me.\\
324 - No, man. That's cool.
You know, Fez is a good guy.\\
325 - I think if he'd make you happy,
that's what you should do.\\
326 - Wow. Steven, thanks.\\
327 - And if it doesn't work out,
I hear Bob's available.\\
328 - And if that's no good,
here comes the garbage man!\\
329 - Oh, and hey, there's a garden gnome
across the street you haven't done.\\
330 - Hey, Fez, okay, we need to talk.\\
331 - Yes, yes, we do. I thought about
what you said and you were right.\\
332 - - I was?
- Yes.\\
333 - Yes. Hilary did me
a big favor by leaving.\\
334 - Yes!
Yeah, okay, I think so, too.\\
335 - And what I realized is I shouldn't
be tied down to one woman!\\
336 - - Wait. What?
- Yes!\\
337 - I should be spreading my seed
all across the land.\\
338 - So, America, get ready,\\
339 - 'cause Fez is coming out in
action and no woman is safe!\\
340 - Except you. Nightie night!\\
341 - Don't get me
started on my home life.\\
342 - My wife and I haven't
slept together for months.\\
343 - But it's not all good news.\\
344 - Oh, well, looks like
our hour is almost up.\\
345 - But it seems like
you could use a drink.\\
346 - Pour one for yourself.\\
347 - Oh, no.
I never touch the stuff!\\
348 - Oh, what the hell,
doctor's orders!
\subsection {Episode 18: We Will Rock You}
1 - Fez, guess what I just got.
The new Village People album!\\
2 - How many songs can they write about
where men go to massage each other?\\
3 - The Navy.
These boys never let me down!\\
4 - Disco sucks, man.
It's painful to listen to.\\
5 - It makes me wanna shoot myself.\\
6 - It's the musical
equivalent of Jackie.\\
7 - Wow. Look at these guys.\\
8 - Their music is so bad
they need to wear disguises\\
9 - just so people don't beat
the crap out of them.\\
10 - Oh, I heard how in Chicago they
made a huge bonfire out of disco records.\\
11 - Also, they cover
their hotdogs in pastrami.\\
12 - It's freaking awesome.\\
13 - Man, we should
have our own bonfire.\\
14 - I'm sick of corporations selling
crap to kids that dumbs them down\\
15 - and makes them act stupid.\\
16 - Hey. I can sell
beer at the bonfire!\\
17 - I've got tons of old disco
records we can burn.\\
18 - What? I was young!
And what do you expect?\\
19 - You see the hair.\\
20 - You guys are awful.
Disco has been great to me.\\
21 - Without disco, if I rub my
crotch on a girl, it's illegal.\\
22 - With disco, it's a bar mitzvah.\\
23 - See, disco has given Fez and I
some of our best times together.\\
24 - Oh, like remember the night when we
beat Johnny and Melina at that dance-off?\\
25 - Oh, we kicked
their gold-lame asses!\\
26 - You know what? I heard
Johnny's working at a car wash.\\
27 - Yeah!
Uh-huh. We did that to him.\\
28 - Jackie, be nice.\\
29 - Car wash. He's poor!\\
30 - You see that? See? We got
a trophy and the satisfaction\\
31 - of knowing we ruined
two people's lives.\\
32 - So you can have your little
bonfire, but we're not going.\\
33 - Yeah, I'm going to Weight
Watchers to pick up women.\\
34 - The thin ones are great,
but they have low self-esteem.\\
35 - That way, you get a hot chick
for fat girls prices.\\
36 - Wait, Fez.
Hey, maybe we should go.\\
37 - You know, and defend the music
that we love. As a team.\\
38 - Sure, what the hell. Weight
Watcher meetings will always be there.\\
39 - God bless The Dairy State.\\
40 - We never run out of fat girls.\\
41 - Pretty clever there, Jackie.\\
42 - Using a disco bonfire as a way to
cozy up next to the guy you secretly love.\\
43 - Yeah, you know, it kind
of reminds me of a song.\\
44 - Jackie loves the foreign boy
Hola, taco\\
45 - Look, I am not gonna sit back and
let Fez try to pick up other women,\\
46 - much less fat chicks.\\
47 - I mean, maybe if we go together,\\
48 - he'll see that we're
perfect for each other.\\
49 - So, we're coming.\\
50 - Fine. But if you get in the
way of me setting things on fire,\\
51 - you're getting set on fire.\\
52 - Hanging out\\
53 - Down the street\\
54 - The same old thing\\
55 - We did last week\\
56 - Not a thing to do\\
57 - But talk to you\\
58 - We're all all right\\
59 - We're all all right\\
60 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
61 - Red, I invited the new neighbors
over for coffee and cookies.\\
62 - That way I can bad-mouth the rest
of the block before they do it to me.\\
63 - Kitty, I don't wanna
meet new neighbors.\\
64 - I had to wait 12 years
for the old ones to croak.\\
65 - Always wanted to
talk and say, "Hello!"\\
66 - Dumb asses.\\
67 - Oh, okay, they're here.
Now, be nice.\\
68 - I haven't met the wife yet, but
the husband, Josh, was very sweet.\\
69 - He's a car salesman, and he told me
he'd give me a great deal on a LeBaron,\\
70 - just because he likes me.\\
71 - Although he's gonna have to
ask his supervisor first.\\
72 - Hello, Josh!\\
73 - Hi, Kitty.
Good to see you again.\\
74 - This is Jeff.\\
75 - Hi, Jeff. Where's your wife?\\
76 - You're looking at her.\\
77 - The only lady in my life is my
little Pomeranian, Tina Louise.\\
78 - Who is going to the pound if she
doesn't stop humping my cowboy boots.\\
79 - We are not having
this conversation here.\\
80 - Okay, well, I'm confused.\\
81 - So, you two live together, but I only
saw the movers bringing in one bed.\\
82 - Oh!\\
83 - Well!\\
84 - Congratulations!\\
85 - Look, Red, the new
neighbors are here,\\
86 - and they're a couple of fellows.\\
87 - Wait a second.
You guys live together?\\
88 - Yep.\\
89 - Without any
wives or girlfriends?\\
90 - Yep.\\
91 - - You know what I
call guys like you?
- Oh, dear.\\
92 - Lucky bastards!\\
93 - Well, the bonfire
looks pretty sturdy.\\
94 - Remember,
if the flames get too high,\\
95 - we saw the foreign kid
playing with the matches.\\
96 - Hey. Who was that girl
you were talking to?\\
97 - Oh, Lisa Conner. A girl I
dated a couple of years ago\\
98 - when I was a camp counselor.\\
99 - Oh, I never knew you were
a camp counselor.\\
100 - It didn't last too long. Apparently,
going on a canoe trip with six kids\\
101 - and coming back with
five is a big no-no.\\
102 - Hey, man. How much for a beer?\\
103 - - One dollar.
- Awesome. There you go.\\
104 - Now, if you want it in a cup,
that's an extra three bucks.\\
105 - Oh! And, there's a two-dollar
pouring charge.\\
106 - You want six bucks for a beer?\\
107 - You can always go
to the other place.\\
108 - There is no other place.\\
109 - What do you know?\\
110 - Looks like I got
what you'd call a monopoly.\\
111 - You have change for a ten?\\
112 - Nope.\\
113 - There he is, Officer!\\
114 - Here's the guy
who is responsible\\
115 - for this illegal gathering
of dirty and ugly people.\\
116 - These two tell me you
organized an illegal bonfire.\\
117 - You two narced on me?\\
118 - What?\\
119 - You stand there and
accuse me of narcing?\\
120 - No, sir! No! I did not narc!\\
121 - What's "narc"?\\
122 - Calling the cops.\\
123 - Oh, yes, we narced.\\
124 - That's right, Steven,\\
125 - because Fez and I both feel that
burning disco records is wrong.\\
126 - Just like burning books,
but worse,\\
127 - because disco tells a story.\\
128 - Wait, this is
a disco-burning bonfire?\\
129 - That's fantastic! Disco sucks!\\
130 - Well, what do you know? A degenerate
and a cop having a beer together.\\
131 - It's a disco-sucking miracle.\\
132 - You know, I'm taking an
astronomy class in college right now.\\
133 - - See those three stars
in a row right there?
- Mmm-hmm.\\
134 - That's Virgo.\\
135 - That's an airplane.\\
136 - I do not go to a good school.\\
137 - - Oh, my God! Randy?
- Linda?\\
138 - - Oh, my God! Missy is here, too!
- Is she?\\
139 - Oh, my God! I'll go get her!\\
140 - Who was that?\\
141 - Linda.\\
142 - - I dated her.
- Oh.\\
143 - And her sister, Missy.\\
144 - Not together, there was a
summer in between them.\\
145 - Summer was their cousin.\\
146 - Wow. I'm dating a man-slut.\\
147 - Look, I'm sure you've dated
a lot of people, too.\\
148 - I mean, if we took all
the people I've dated\\
149 - and all the people you've dated
and put them in a room together...\\
150 - We'd have a room
full of girls, and Eric.\\
151 - What do you guys
have against disco?\\
152 - It's the only thing
white people can dance to.\\
153 - Hey, Jackie.\\
154 - I was thinking of a way to get back
at you for calling the cops on me,\\
155 - and then it hit me. You're
only here to get with Fez.\\
156 - So I figured,
why not find the skankiest,\\
157 - sluttiest, drunkest chick here,\\
158 - give her three more beers,
and introduce her to Fez?\\
159 - Oh, you wouldn't!\\
160 - - Oh, I already did.
- You didn't!\\
161 - - I just said I did.
- You wouldn't dare.\\
162 - I did! Turn around and look!\\
163 - Enjoy your evening.\\
164 - Fez!\\
165 - What are you doing?\\
166 - It's fantastic.\\
167 - Every time I say, "Disco sucks,"\\
168 - Kelly sticks her tongue
down my throat.\\
169 - Watch. Disco sucks!\\
170 - It's like a magic trick!\\
171 - Wait. Fez! You're
supposed to be here with me!\\
172 - Besides, don't you know
about rocker chicks?\\
173 - They all have syphilis.\\
174 - Do you have syphilis?\\
175 - I don't think so.\\
176 - That's good enough for me, baby.\\
177 - Oh, what a game!\\
178 - That quarterback is 11 for 12
with no interceptions.\\
179 - He is hot!\\
180 - Ridiculously hot.\\
181 - Oh? Another cookie?\\
182 - What?\\
183 - Nothing. I just thought we were
trying to slim down for the Bahamas.\\
184 - Well, excuse me,
Mr. Two Scoops of Sherbet.\\
185 - You know, you guys
don't need wives.\\
186 - You bicker like
an old married couple.\\
187 - Red, I need to talk
to you in the kitchen.\\
188 - - Kitty, I'm watching the game.
- Red.\\
189 - Oh, fine. You know, I wish
there was a bar we could go to\\
190 - where there'd be
no women, just guys.\\
191 - I know a few.\\
192 - I am having it.\\
193 - Okay, Kitty, what is it?\\
194 - Okay, it's about the neighbors.\\
195 - There's something
you should know.\\
196 - - Touchdown!
- Oh!\\
197 - Damn it!
See what you made me miss?\\
198 - Kitty,
I think those guys are gay!\\
199 - Red, you can't hide from
Jeff and Josh all night!\\
200 - Not all night. Just till they eat all
the cookies and decide to skip home.\\
201 - Red Forman! So our
neighbors are gay. So what?\\
202 - At least they'll keep
the place nice,\\
203 - and our property
values will go up.\\
204 - What am I supposed
to say to them now?\\
205 - You've been talking to them
the whole game,\\
206 - you knew what to say then.\\
207 - Well, that was before I saw
them kissing in my living room.\\
208 - Didn't bother you last night
when you saw Abbott kiss Costello.\\
209 - Well, that was different. They
had to do that to fool the landlord.\\
210 - - Hey, Red. Can I borrow some socks?
- No.\\
211 - Bob, we're having a crisis here.\\
212 - The new neighbors are gay!\\
213 - They're gay?\\
214 - Oh, great! Now they're
gonna be all over me.\\
215 - What the hell are
you talking about?\\
216 - I can't explain it.
Men find me attractive.\\
217 - Yeah. Everybody wants
a piece of the Pinci.\\
218 - Well, Red, you can't let them
sit in there all night.\\
219 - What if they
rearrange my furniture?\\
220 - Fine, I'll talk to them.\\
221 - Okay, but handle it gracefully.\\
222 - Well, of course I will.
Give me a little credit.\\
223 - Good night, guys!\\
224 - I have to go throw up again.\\
225 - Okay. Hurry back!\\
226 - Hey, Fez.\\
227 - Village People!
What are you doing here?\\
228 - We came to put a stop
to your disco bonfire.\\
229 - Plus my mom lives in Kenosha,
so, you know,\\
230 - two birds with one stone.\\
231 - Can you keep a secret?
I love disco.\\
232 - Yeah, I'm just pretending to
hate it so I can get with girls.\\
233 - You guys know how
that is, right, guys?\\
234 - So, let's talk about Jackie.\\
235 - You two came here together to
defend disco, and you abandoned her\\
236 - to make out with some skank
you're never gonna see again.\\
237 - And?\\
238 - And? It's wrong!\\
239 - What do we have to do, spell
it out for you? Because we can,\\
240 - with carefully choreographed
arm movements.\\
241 - Yeah, you're right.
I totally let Jackie down.\\
242 - You are one wise Indian.\\
243 - Actually, I'm Puerto Rican.
This is just a gig.\\
244 - Okay, I'm done vomiting.\\
245 - Wanna finish making out?\\
246 - I would love to,
but I can't, for two reasons.\\
247 - One, I have somewhere to be.\\
248 - And two,\\
249 - you have some
spaghetti right here.\\
250 - So it turns out Randy
has dated every girl here.\\
251 - I can literally throw a rock
and hit a girl he's dated.\\
252 - In fact, earlier I did.
She's gonna need stitches.\\
253 - Oh, I remember that girl. I sold
her a Band-Aid for eight bucks.\\
254 - Where did you find a Band-Aid?\\
255 - I pulled it off some guy
who was passed out.\\
256 - Donna! Donna, look
what I found. This is Sarah,\\
257 - a girl I've never dated,
who I don't wanna date,\\
258 - and who doesn't want to date me.\\
259 - - Right, Sarah?
- That's right!\\
260 - Although you are kind of cute.\\
261 - - Goodbye, Sarah.
- Would you like
to go out sometime?\\
262 - - Go away, Sarah.
- Okay, but call me.\\
263 - Oh, man, the keg's tapped.
Looks like everyone took a turn.\\
264 - Just like with Randy.\\
265 - All right. It's time
to light this bonfire.\\
266 - Rockers of Point Place,
it is time\\
267 - for fire!\\
268 - No! Steven, no!
You can't burn these records.\\
269 - You're right, Jackie, I can't,\\
270 - because I'm too drunk.\\
271 - - Randy? Come burn these records.
- Stop!\\
272 - - Fez? You came back.
- Jackie,
I need to tell you something,\\
273 - - something about you and me.
- Really?\\
274 - Yes. This whole time, I was
off making out with that girl,\\
275 - and all of
a sudden it felt wrong.\\
276 - - It did?
- Yes. I shouldn't
have been with her.\\
277 - I should have been with you.\\
278 - Oh, my God. Fez, I've wanted
to hear that for so long.\\
279 - - I feel the same way.
- And I realized something,\\
280 - and I want everyone to know it!\\
281 - Jackie Burkhart
and I are in love\\
282 - with disco!\\
283 - Wait. What?\\
284 - Yeah, and I will not stand by
and let you set fire\\
285 - to these musical
booty-shaking masterpieces.\\
286 - That's unfortunate.\\
287 - So, you did pretty well tonight.\\
288 - Yep. And I learned a valuable
lesson about art versus commerce.\\
289 - The lesson is,\\
290 - I'm rich.\\
291 - Good for you, man.\\
292 - But I'm gonna have to write you a
little ticket for disturbing the peace,\\
293 - and that's gonna
cost you about...\\
294 - How much you got there?\\
295 - - 208 bucks.
- 208 bucks.\\
296 - Fine.\\
297 - Officer Ron?\\
298 - You don't wanna
buy your badge back?\\
299 - Oh, and your car?\\
300 - This whole night
has been a nightmare.\\
301 - You know, I thought Fez was
gonna tell me he loved me, but no,\\
302 - he was just trying
to be a good friend.\\
303 - Ugh! What a jerk.\\
304 - Jackie, everybody
could use another friend.\\
305 - Well, except Randy.\\
306 - What are you looking at, bitch?\\
307 - Avon calling!\\
308 - Josh! Jeff! You're back!\\
309 - Look, Red,
Josh and Jeff are back.\\
310 - Hey,\\
311 - men.\\
312 - Red, we just wanted to come by
to thank you.\\
313 - - Thank me?
- Yeah. It's not that easy\\
314 - for two guys like us to just move into
a new neighborhood and make friends.\\
315 - But you welcomed us into
your home with open arms.\\
316 - Well, sure! You're a couple of
decent guys.\\
317 - Not before he's had his coffee.\\
318 - Like you're a ray of sunshine!\\
319 - Anyway, you've been great.\\
320 - The last place we lived, we had
to tell people we were brothers.\\
321 - Who would ever believe that
the two of us could be brothers?\\
322 - Anyway, we wanted to give
you this, you know, to say thanks.\\
323 - What is it?\\
324 - Fruit cake.\\
325 - Well, that's clever. It's a
dessert and an ice-breaker.\\
326 - Well, what do you say we all
sit down and watch the Packers\\
327 - kick the crap out
of the Vikings, huh?\\
328 - Well, we like the Vikings.\\
329 - What did you say?\\
330 - You're Viking fans?\\
331 - What the hell is wrong with you?\\
332 - Get out of my house!\\
333 - Red, come on, it's not our
fault. We're from Minnesota.\\
334 - We were born this way!\\
335 - Out! Out, sickos!\\
336 - Well, thanks a lot, Red.\\
337 - Now I'll never know what rug
ties this room together.\\
338 - Thank you. Next please.\\
339 - Hi, guys!\\
340 - I love it! That's exactly
what we need!\\
341 - Leather guy, you're out.
Chicken, you're in.\\
342 - Hallelujah!\\
343 - It's fun to stay
at the Y.M.C.A.\\
344 - It's fun to stay
at the Y.M.C.A.\\
345 - They have everything
for you men to enjoy\\
346 - You can hang
out with all the boys\\
347 - It's fun to stay at the...
\subsection {Episode 19: Sheer Heart Attack}
1 - Wow, that was great.\\
2 - I'm glad we
stretched beforehand.\\
3 - And I have to say,
I was terrific.\\
4 - You know, I've never
said this before, Tracy,\\
5 - but you're the
best lover I ever had.\\
6 - You know, I've never
said this before, Nicole,\\
7 - but you're the best lover
I ever had.\\
8 - I never said this before, Susan.\\
9 - You're the best
lover I ever had.\\
10 - My name's Lucy!\\
11 - The one time people understand
me, I get the name wrong.\\
12 - Jackie, I'd offer
you a third sandwich,\\
13 - but you cleaned me out of meat
and condiments.\\
14 - And Cheez Whiz.\\
15 - Well, now we're going to
have to use the artificial stuff.\\
16 - I don't know what's
wrong with me, okay?\\
17 - I want a guy I can't have.
I can't stop stuffing my face.\\
18 - I am a thin girl
with fat-girl problems.\\
19 - All right. If Fez and Jackie
get together, it's official.\\
20 - She becomes Point
Place's sluttiest slut.\\
21 - Well, I think it's nice
you want to be with Fez.\\
22 - He has turned into
a fine young man.\\
23 - And you never know with
foreigners. They can go either way.\\
24 - Come on, Jackie,
I know what'll cheer you up.\\
25 - Let's go down to the mall
and make fun of all the people\\
26 - coming out of
the Big & Tall store.\\
27 - Donna, if you need something
from the Big & Tall, just say so.\\
28 - Well, Kitty,\\
29 - cardiologist says I don't have
to take my heart pills anymore.\\
30 - Well, that is wonderful news.\\
31 - Oh, and you know
what this means?\\
32 - We can bring back
fried-cheese Fridays!\\
33 - It's not good news, Kitty.\\
34 - I just bought a four-month supply
of heart pills I don't need now.\\
35 - That's 200 bucks
down the crapper.\\
36 - Why don't you just sell them?\\
37 - You know, there's
a seedy subculture\\
38 - that buys drugs for recreation.\\
39 - I saw one time on
an after-school special.\\
40 - Well, you can't sell drugs.\\
41 - It's illegal, and it should be.\\
42 - Because people
shouldn't have easy access\\
43 - to addictive substances
that dull their senses.\\
44 - I will be in the bath.\\
45 - You know, man,
you can sell those pills.\\
46 - No, I can't.\\
47 - Yes, you can. You just
have to find the right market.\\
48 - Well, who the hell is going
to want a bunch of heart pills?\\
49 - Anybody here take procardiacs?\\
50 - The doctor is in.\\
51 - Hanging out\\
52 - Down the street\\
53 - The same old thing\\
54 - We did last week\\
55 - Not a thing to do\\
56 - But talk to you\\
57 - We're all all right\\
58 - We're all all right\\
59 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
60 - It is torture knowing Fez is
with all these different women.\\
61 - All I hear from his bedroom is,\\
62 - "Oh Fez, you're so hot!"\\
63 - Then he comes out of his room
and goes off to his date.\\
64 - Yeah. If the walls of Fez's
bedroom could talk...\\
65 - Well, we probably wouldn't be
able to understand them, either.\\
66 - No, if the walls in Fez's
bedroom could talk, they'd yell,\\
67 - "Quit humping your
Victoria Principal poster!"\\
68 - Oh. Hey, Fez.\\
69 - Where's your skank of the day?\\
70 - I worked a double yesterday.\\
71 - So I'm taking the day off.\\
72 - In fact, I'm taking a break
from the ladies altogether.\\
73 - I knew it, he's gay.\\
74 - I just won 20 bucks
from Mrs. Forman.\\
75 - No, I'm done sowing
my wild oats.\\
76 - Mostly because my oats
can't take it anymore.\\
77 - These tight jeans make my ass look
great, but you pay the price up front.\\
78 - So wait. Fez, um, what,
no more one-night stands?\\
79 - Nope. I just didn't find those
meaningless flings satisfying.\\
80 - I think I might
be a one-woman guy.\\
81 - Do you hear that, Jackie?\\
82 - Fez is a one-woman guy.\\
83 - Yeah. Surprising, but true.\\
84 - Now if you'll excuse me, these
jeans are splitting me in half.\\
85 - Congratulations,
Jackie, he's all yours.\\
86 - It's like you won the lottery.\\
87 - Well, you know,
like a really crappy lottery.\\
88 - Pretty cool, huh?\\
89 - Fifty bucks for
15 minutes' work.\\
90 - That was on a slow day.\\
91 - Imagine what we could make if we
set up shop on Betty Grable movie night.\\
92 - Steven, we're not
setting up shop anywhere.\\
93 - All I want to do is
get my money back.\\
94 - Just like after I bought Eric
that baseball mitt.\\
95 - Dumb ass used it as a hat!\\
96 - Fine. We'll just
get your money back.\\
97 - Now, where is
the rest of the stash?\\
98 - It's in the medicine cabinet.\\
99 - And don't start calling the
heart medicine "the stash."\\
100 - It makes it
sound like we're...\\
101 - What's going on?\\
102 - Oh, just having
a little man-to-man talk.\\
103 - About what?\\
104 - Well...\\
105 - Steven's getting a little
older, and he just had some\\
106 - questions.\\
107 - Oh, please.
He was married to a stripper.\\
108 - If anything, he should
be giving you advice.\\
109 - See what you made me do?\\
110 - Now I'm lying to
Kitty about selling drugs.\\
111 - That's it. I'm
throwing those pills away.\\
112 - I can't spend my retirement
as a lying dope peddler.\\
113 - No, man, you're
not a dope peddler.\\
114 - You are a champion
of the people!\\
115 - Now, where does Kitty keep
those little plastic baggies?\\
116 - So, Fez, I hear you've been\\
117 - with a different
woman every night.\\
118 - I just hope you're doing
the gentlemanly thing.\\
119 - Thank-you cards
never go out of style.\\
120 - Actually, Miss Kitty, I'm
hanging up my leather pants.\\
121 - Yes. I'm ready to be
with the one woman\\
122 - I should've been with all along.\\
123 - Fez, I've told you
a thousand times,\\
124 - Mr. Forman and I are
very happy together.\\
125 - I'm just kidding.\\
126 - So, is this woman
someone I know?\\
127 - Yes.\\
128 - And I know for a fact
that she likes me.\\
129 - Oh.\\
130 - Oh!\\
131 - Fez, I am so happy for you.\\
132 - New love is exciting.\\
133 - I remember the first time I
tried Peppermint Schnapps.\\
134 - But I want to be the one
to tell her, so, um...\\
135 - So please don't tell anyone
we had this conversation.\\
136 - I already forgot about it.\\
137 - What?\\
138 - We just had it.
Pay attention.\\
139 - No, Fez, I can keep a secret.\\
140 - For instance,
I never told anyone\\
141 - that I once caught Red\\
142 - wearing my nightgown
to keep his legs warm.\\
143 - Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You didn't hear that.\\
144 - Yes, I did.
I was right here.\\
145 - No, I'm just saying,
your secret's safe with me.\\
146 - - Oh.
- Okay.\\
147 - Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman.
What's up?\\
148 - Fez is crazy about you!\\
149 - - Wait. What? Really?
- Yeah.\\
150 - Now, I wasn't supposed
to say anything,\\
151 - but I hate when they drag
things out on soap operas.\\
152 - Nothing happens Monday
through Thursday.\\
153 - We all know
Marlena's the killer.\\
154 - Let's just sell
these things and go home.\\
155 - I don't want to be
known as the pill guy.\\
156 - Relax, you're not the pill guy.\\
157 - Hey, it's the pill guy.\\
158 - Smitty, keep it down.\\
159 - Red, can you get
me any diet pills?\\
160 - My wife's having trouble
getting into the house.\\
161 - Through the garage.\\
162 - You think your wife is big?\\
163 - My wife just took a job
at the movie theater.\\
164 - As the screen.\\
165 - Hey, guys.\\
166 - Did you come here to
tell jokes or do business?\\
167 - The way I see it,
you guys got a condition,\\
168 - we got the product.\\
169 - So quit yanking my crank,
and let's do this, huh?\\
170 - So is there someplace that we
could talk a little more private?\\
171 - Certainly.\\
172 - Step into my office.\\
173 - Okay, this is what
I've been thinking.\\
174 - You give us
the rest of the pills,\\
175 - and we give you
two cases of beer,\\
176 - plus a couple of passes
to our Friday night\\
177 - Bingo marathon
and Medicare seminar.\\
178 - What kind of deal is that?\\
179 - I come down here,\\
180 - sit in the sauna
with you half-naked,\\
181 - and this is what you offer me?\\
182 - Come on, Red,
let's hit the nursing homes.\\
183 - Whoa, whoa, settle down, kid.\\
184 - We're all friends here.
Let's work something out\\
185 - before we say
things we don't mean\\
186 - and someone winds up dead.\\
187 - Just kidding.
Let's order a pizza.\\
188 - I just want to
get this over with.\\
189 - So, Steven, shut up.\\
190 - Cal, I'm gonna sell
you those pills at cost.\\
191 - And, Smitty, for the last
time, close your damn legs.\\
192 - I can't believe Fez likes me.\\
193 - I mean, you guys, this is
everything I ever dreamed of.\\
194 - Having said that,
I'm really glad\\
195 - my racist father isn't here
to see us together.\\
196 - Oh, good. You're all here.\\
197 - I have some big
news to tell you.\\
198 - Unless it's that you're gay,
I don't want to hear it.\\
199 - Shut up, Bjorn Borg.\\
200 - Well, Fez? What is it?\\
201 - Well, I finally figured out
the one woman for me.\\
202 - As a matter of fact,
she is here right now.\\
203 - Oh, my God.\\
204 - Hi, guys!\\
205 - - Caroline!
- Caroline!\\
206 - I haven't seen you
since you tried to kill us.\\
207 - I just couldn't believe it
when Fez called.\\
208 - It was so nice to hear
a familiar voice.\\
209 - Oh, you mean coming
from outside your head?\\
210 - Okay, the old me would've
ripped out your eyeballs\\
211 - and hung them from
my rear-view mirror like dice.\\
212 - But the new me just smiles
and slaps the anger away.\\
213 - How sexy is that?\\
214 - Uh, Fez, you said you
were a one-woman guy.\\
215 - Caroline's got,
like, eight personalities.\\
216 - You'll go to bed with her one
night, and wake up the next morning\\
217 - with, like, an 82-year-old
Portuguese fisherman.\\
218 - Hey, Caroline accepts me
for who I am,\\
219 - so I'm gonna accept her
for who they are.\\
220 - Fez, the last time
you dated Caroline,\\
221 - she chased you around the room
with a corkscrew.\\
222 - It's called foreplay, jerk.\\
223 - Yeah, nothing spices up the
bedroom like a crazy woman\\
224 - who might suffocate you
in your sleep with a pillow.\\
225 - Donna, we were role-playing.\\
226 - She was a sexy nurse and I
was the guy she was trying to kill.\\
227 - Red, do you need anything
from the supermarket?\\
228 - Yeah.\\
229 - Graham Crackers that
don't taste like cardboard.\\
230 - I fought in two wars.\\
231 - I deserve name-brand cookies.\\
232 - Well, those are name-brand.\\
233 - Look at the box,
there's the Kubler Dwarves.\\
234 - I can't believe we're out
of plastic baggies already.\\
235 - I swear I just bought a box.\\
236 - Well, maybe you misplaced them.\\
237 - You know,
you're always losing things.\\
238 - Like aluminum foil.\\
239 - Remember that time
you lost the aluminum foil?\\
240 - I sure do.\\
241 - Hello?\\
242 - Hello?\\
243 - Is anybody there?\\
244 - That's the third hang-up today.\\
245 - Oh, and this afternoon,\\
246 - someone called and asked me
if I had "the stuff."\\
247 - Wait a second.\\
248 - I saw a 60 Minutes piece
on this the other day.\\
249 - Missing baggies, mysterious
phone calls. I know what's going on.\\
250 - - Kitty, I can explain.
- Steven's selling drugs.\\
251 - Yes, he is.\\
252 - Wow.\\
253 - She's really putting away
that pizza.\\
254 - The last time I saw her this upset
was when Reverend Brown told her\\
255 - that ugly people
go to heaven, too.\\
256 - So, Jackie,
can I get a slice of that?\\
257 - No!\\
258 - Okay. I was only asking
because it's mine.\\
259 - Jackie, look.\\
260 - Fez and Caroline
are never going to last.\\
261 - Hi, guys.\\
262 - Well, that was just bad timing.\\
263 - Why are you
wearing a wedding dress?\\
264 - Oh, my God.\\
265 - Did Fez propose to you?\\
266 - Not yet, but he will.\\
267 - And I wanted to show him
what I look like.\\
268 - Oh, but you know,
I was hoping he'd be here,\\
269 - 'cause I gotta get
this back to the store\\
270 - before they realize I climbed
out the dressing room window.\\
271 - Don't worry. I'm sure they'll
just knock off 10%\\
272 - and put it on the rack marked
"Previously worn by psychos."\\
273 - You have a sharp tongue.\\
274 - It would taste great in a salad.\\
275 - I can't believe Fez chose
that whack job over me.\\
276 - Jackie, the only reason
Fez chose Caroline over you\\
277 - is because he has no idea
that you like him.\\
278 - Yeah? Well, whose
fault's that, Donna?\\
279 - Yours.\\
280 - Oh, well, thank you
for kicking me while I'm down.\\
281 - You know, Jackie,\\
282 - if you worked as hard
at getting Fez\\
283 - as you are at
polishing off my pizza,\\
284 - you'd be pushing a little bilingual
baby through the park right now.\\
285 - Steven, how could you?\\
286 - Just a product
of my environment.\\
287 - Wait, what are you
talking about?\\
288 - We know you've been
selling drugs out of the house.\\
289 - This is the worst
thing you have ever done.\\
290 - You have turned my living room
into East St. Louis.\\
291 - So, please,
just admit what you're doing.\\
292 - It'll be better for everybody.\\
293 - I'm not admitting to anything.\\
294 - Although if I were
selling drugs,\\
295 - it's probably 'cause I don't
have a new 19-inch TV\\
296 - to keep me off the streets.\\
297 - What?\\
298 - Steven, we do not reward
this kind of behavior.\\
299 - Right, Red?\\
300 - Right.\\
301 - A 13-inch TV
should do the trick.\\
302 - Why are you even
discussing this?\\
303 - If ever there were a time\\
304 - for your foot to be ankle-deep
in someone's bottom,\\
305 - it's now!\\
306 - Red, those pills
sold like hotcakes.\\
307 - We came by to give you your cut.\\
308 - This is not a good time, guys.\\
309 - Red Forman, have you been
selling your heart medication?\\
310 - Yeah. They've done wonders
for me in the bedroom.\\
311 - I'm asleep before
my wife comes in.\\
312 - I can't believe this.\\
313 - I could take care of
your problem here, Red.\\
314 - No questions asked.\\
315 - I'm kidding. We should all
have dinner sometime.\\
316 - - Yeah, well, thanks
for coming by, guys.
- Sure.\\
317 - Red?\\
318 - Look, I know what
I did was wrong.\\
319 - But don't you even want to know\\
320 - - what I was going
to do with the money?
- I don't care.\\
321 - I was going to take you on a
vacation to the Wisconsin Dells.\\
322 - Oh, my God,
I feel like a Kennedy!\\
323 - Oh, and the Dells are
three counties away.\\
324 - We're going to have
to take the Interstate.\\
325 - Well, that worked out
pretty good.\\
326 - You're going to the Dells,
I'm getting a new TV.\\
327 - Yeah.\\
328 - And you're going to love
watching that new show called\\
329 - Blow It Out Your Ass.\\
330 - Hey, uh, Fez, we need to talk.\\
331 - Okay, fine.\\
332 - I used your deodorant
because I wanted to see\\
333 - if it was strong enough
for a man.\\
334 - By the way, it wasn't.\\
335 - Fez, you see,\\
336 - when I heard you were ready
to be with one woman,\\
337 - I got really excited.\\
338 - But that's because I thought you
were talking about someone else.\\
339 - Who?\\
340 - Fez!\\
341 - Um, I can explain.\\
342 - Go ahead.\\
343 - Um, her tongue was in my mouth
and then you walked in.\\
344 - You cheating bastard.\\
345 - Oh...\\
346 - Why do you make
me do this to you?\\
347 - Not in the face!\\
348 - Ow! Okay, the face!
The face!\\
349 - So, how are you feeling?\\
350 - Not so good.\\
351 - My face is freezing.\\
352 - I'm really sorry this happened,\\
353 - but you're actually
lucky that she's gone.\\
354 - Jackie, what was
that kiss all about?\\
355 - Okay, Fez, it's something
that I've wanted to do\\
356 - for a really long time.\\
357 - And I was wondering, you know,\\
358 - hoping that maybe you and I
could be together.\\
359 - You want to be with me?\\
360 - Yeah.\\
361 - I mean, Fez, my life
has been so crappy lately\\
362 - that you have been
the one good thing.\\
363 - Oh. So you want me
because you're lonely?\\
364 - Great, so that makes me what,
your last resort?\\
365 - No. Fez, you're wrong.
It's not...\\
366 - You know what, Jackie?
Forget it.\\
367 - You've already been
with Kelso and Hyde.\\
368 - I don't want to be
your sloppy thirds.\\
369 - Okay.\\
370 - Hey, guys.\\
371 - I ran across some more
of those heart pills.\\
372 - Well, actually,
we have all we need.\\
373 - Oh. Really?\\
374 - Sure would be a shame if you
ran out just when you needed them.\\
375 - Like, say you're driving
your car, and all of a sudden,\\
376 - you find out your brake
lines have been cut.\\
377 - Who would do that?\\
378 - I don't know.
Maybe a guy who knows a guy.\\
379 - But hey,
if you guys don't need them,\\
380 - you don't need them.\\
381 - - Drive safe.
- I'll take 20 pills.\\
382 - That's what I like to hear.\\
383 - You did the right thing.
\subsection {Episode 20: Leaving Home Ain't Easy}
1 - Fez.\\
2 - I didn't say anything when you
started spying on Donna.\\
3 - I kept my mouth shut when
you hid in the dirty towel bin\\
4 - to peep on the cheerleaders,\\
5 - but if you're getting your jollies
listening to people go potty,\\
6 - I'm calling a doctor.\\
7 - Shh.\\
8 - I'm trying to hear
if Jackie's okay.\\
9 - She's been in the bathroom
for hours, crying.\\
10 - Oh, my God.
You had sex with her.\\
11 - No, she told me she wanted to be
my girlfriend and I turned her down.\\
12 - - What? Why?
- Because she didn't mean it.\\
13 - She never wanted me before.\\
14 - And now that she's desperate,
suddenly I'm the guy for her.\\
15 - But as soon as she's happy,
she'll dump me.\\
16 - So I told her to get lost and
now she's in tears.\\
17 - Well, what kind of crying is it?\\
18 - Is it like "My life is over"
kind of crying or\\
19 - hysterical sobbing like the
time Kelso sat on his nads?\\
20 - No, it's bad. I tried everything
to get her out. I yelled, "Fire!"\\
21 - I made monkey-noises and said,
"Wow, that's a gigantic monkey."\\
22 - But no luck.\\
23 - - She must be a complete wreck.
- Oh, hey, guys!\\
24 - Oh. She's perfectly fine. So you
definitely didn't have sex with her.\\
25 - - Jackie, you're okay?
- Oh, no. No, I'm not okay.\\
26 - I just decided being
sad is a waste of time.\\
27 - Yeah, see a more productive
use of my time is revenge.\\
28 - So get ready.\\
29 - Because I am going to rain doom
down on your stupid foreign head!\\
30 - That didn't seem so bad, Fez.
I wouldn't worry about it.\\
31 - - You wouldn't?
- No.\\
32 - That's because I'm safe.\\
33 - You should be
friggin' terrified.\\
34 - Hanging out\\
35 - Down the street\\
36 - The same old thing\\
37 - We did last week\\
38 - Not a thing to do\\
39 - But talk to you\\
40 - We're all all right\\
41 - We're all all right\\
42 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
43 - Hey, hey!\\
44 - Just got back from Florida.
Want to see my tan lines?\\
45 - Oh, for gosh sakes, Bob.\\
46 - Joke's on you. I don't got
no tan lines. Whoo-hoo!\\
47 - You were in Florida?\\
48 - Yeah, I was gone for three
weeks. You didn't notice?\\
49 - I just figured my migraine
medicine was working.\\
50 - Boy,
it was beautiful down there.\\
51 - The ocean, the sunshine,\\
52 - and Disneyworld is a great
place to pick up single moms.\\
53 - In fact, I like Florida so much,\\
54 - I'm selling the house
and I'm moving there.\\
55 - You're selling your house? What
if someone annoying moves in?\\
56 - I bought a condo.
And get ready for this,\\
57 - I'm gonna open a bait shop.\\
58 - What a great idea.\\
59 - That way, when the hundreds of other
bait shops down there run out of stock,\\
60 - there you'll be.\\
61 - So you think I'm stupid because
I want to open a bait shop?\\
62 - No, of course not.\\
63 - I think you want to open a
bait shop because you're stupid.\\
64 - Well, I didn't come in
here to be ridiculed.\\
65 - Then you shouldn't
have worn that shirt.\\
66 - Red, you need to go over there
and apologize to Bob.\\
67 - He came here all
excited about his idea\\
68 - and you just made him
feel bad about himself.\\
69 - Yeah, he never saw it coming.\\
70 - So did you get Jackie back for
flushing your toothbrush down the toilet?\\
71 - No. Only four out of five
dentists recommend brushing\\
72 - so I just go to the other guy.\\
73 - How about for microwaving
your hand lotion?\\
74 - No, the heat feels nice on my...\\
75 - ...hands.\\
76 - Well, what are you gonna do to her
for ripping all the buttons off your shirt?\\
77 - Thank her. I look fabulous!\\
78 - Man, what is wrong with you?\\
79 - She tore your
shirt for easy access.\\
80 - When Jackie gets angry,
she goes straight for the nipple.\\
81 - Hyde, I turned her down.
She has every right to be angry.\\
82 - But the worst of it is over, so
I'm gonna let bygones be bygones.\\
83 - Fez, let me tell
you a little story.\\
84 - Once upon a time there was
a young girl named Jackie.\\
85 - She destroyed everything in her
path because she was Satan's child.\\
86 - The end.\\
87 - Ah, I see your point.\\
88 - Wait, what's your point?\\
89 - My point is, she's evil, man.
You gotta get back at her.\\
90 - You gotta fight fire with fire.\\
91 - Now you're suggesting I set her
on fire? What has happened to you?\\
92 - I'm just saying every time Jackie
hurts you, you gotta hurt her worse.\\
93 - I don't know, that sounds like
a senseless cycle of violence.\\
94 - Yeah. That's
the best and funniest kind.\\
95 - Look, this whole thing will blow over
once I talk to her about everything.\\
96 - Holy crap!\\
97 - My car! Jackie ruined my car!\\
98 - And you don't have insurance.\\
99 - Good one, Jackie.\\
100 - And look what she wrote
on the side. Fez, has a tiny...\\
101 - I do not!\\
102 - It's perfectly normal, based
on all the other ones I've seen.\\
103 - I only look for comparison.\\
104 - If Jackie wants war,
I'll give her war.\\
105 - Whatever you say, tiny.\\
106 - If it's so small,
why would I name it Big John?\\
107 - - Dad, I don't want
to move to Florida.
- Sure you do.\\
108 - No, I don't!\\
109 - Come on, who doesn't
want to move to Florida?\\
110 - Me!\\
111 - Oh. Well, geez, you should have said
that before I put the house on the market.\\
112 - You put the house on the market?\\
113 - Relax, honey,
I can always take it off.\\
114 - - You can?
- No, it sold this morning.\\
115 - Well, look who it is.
Come over to insult me again?\\
116 - I don't know, maybe take
another cheap shot at my outfit?\\
117 - Okay. There is nothing wrong
with your outfits.\\
118 - Red thinks they're tacky but I've
explained to him that you're just Italian.\\
119 - Anyway, Red has something
he'd like to say to you. Go ahead.\\
120 - Bob, I'm sorry that I said
that your idea is stupid.\\
121 - - And?
- And...\\
122 - The next time you
have a stupid idea,\\
123 - I'll just keep my mouth shut.\\
124 - You know what, Red?\\
125 - I really don't give
a damn what you think.\\
126 - All these years I'd have to put
up with you cutting me down,\\
127 - calling me dumb ass. Well,
guess what? You're the dumb ass!\\
128 - You're nothing
but a cranky\\
129 - who thinks his
don't stink,\\
130 - so you can blow
it out your ass!\\
131 - What? What, you want to hit
me? Go ahead, you bald.\\
132 - Yeah, go ahead, do it!
I'm not afraid of you.\\
133 - In fact, I'll kick your
bony ass right now!\\
134 - Bob, you've got some nerve!\\
135 - Good for you!\\
136 - It's about time you stuck up
for yourself and acted like a man.\\
137 - I'm sorry, Red,
it just slipped out!\\
138 - I'm so sorry, Fez. I was just outside
and I read that you have a tiny...\\
139 - Shut it!\\
140 - Fez, you gotta
do something, man.\\
141 - Because Jackie's
just getting started.\\
142 - When she gets mad,
she is like a revenge machine.\\
143 - She will destroy
you because she can.\\
144 - Get out, man! I gotta get out!
I gotta get out!\\
145 - Huh, flashback.\\
146 - Vandalizing your car, man?
That's disturbed.\\
147 - I mean that car is the only
thing that defines you as a man.\\
148 - You know, because you have
such a tiny...\\
149 - Enough!\\
150 - I gotta get back at her.
Oh, I know! I'll break her TV.\\
151 - Ah, but then I'll
just miss Gilligan.\\
152 - If you're gonna retaliate, you
need to hit Jackie where it hurts.\\
153 - Ah, like in the face?\\
154 - No! What does
Jackie love the most?\\
155 - Herself. All she
cares about is her looks.\\
156 - You're exactly right. I'm gonna buy
some bleach and some razor blades\\
157 - and after I do my laundry and
shave, I'll think of what to do to Jackie.\\
158 - You guys are never
going to believe this.\\
159 - My dad is moving to Florida.\\
160 - Florida is nice. My mom
spent three years down there.\\
161 - Supposed to be five, but she
got time off for good behavior.\\
162 - I've got no place to live.
What am I gonna do?\\
163 - Why don't you move in with me?\\
164 - Donna?
Randy asked you a question.\\
165 - And I for one am giddy with
anticipation to hear the answer.\\
166 - I just meant, we're dating
and I've got the room\\
167 - and if you got homesick I could
walk around naked with my robe open\\
168 - like your Dad.\\
169 - I don't know, I mean I never
really thought about moving in.\\
170 - I mean, we hardly...\\
171 - Well, I do need a place to live.\\
172 - But you don't want me invading.\\
173 - Well, we do watch
the same shows.\\
174 - What the hell, sure.\\
175 - Then,
"What the hell, sure," it is!\\
176 - Jackie's about to get
out of the bathroom.\\
177 - Wait until you see
what I did to her.\\
178 - Fez, if this is
the Ex-Lax prank,\\
179 - I'd rather hear
about it then see it.\\
180 - No, it's better.\\
181 - And she's
turning the shower off.\\
182 - She's getting out.\\
183 - Looks at herself
in the mirror and...\\
184 - Fez!\\
185 - Ho, ho, ho, Green Jackie!\\
186 - - Fez, you
completely ruined my hair!
- You destroyed my car!\\
187 - I had every right to destroy
your car, you turned me down!\\
188 - You turned me down like a million
times and I never did anything!\\
189 - Actually,
I remember a lot of crying.\\
190 - Yes, I cried.
Because I have feelings.\\
191 - Unlike you, Jackie.\\
192 - Oh!\\
193 - I have feelings. And they told
me to buy a bottle of spray paint\\
194 - and tell the whole world
that you have a tiny...\\
195 - It's normal sized!\\
196 - Well, you know what?
I'm glad I turned you down.\\
197 - Because,
you're a mean, bitter girl.\\
198 - And now you're ugly on the
outside like you are ugly in the inside.\\
199 - Holy crap,
man, cover your nipples!\\
200 - I can't believe that's what
you really think of me.\\
201 - Well, it is.\\
202 - Okay, fine. I'll just go pack up
my things and get out of your life.\\
203 - Damn, man, that was harsh.\\
204 - Yeah. It must have been
my Jamaican Fire.\\
205 - So, you're from Jamaica?\\
206 - No, Jamaican Fire.
It's my new cologne.\\
207 - See, these blue
buildings are condos\\
208 - and the green ones,
those are cabanas.\\
209 - What's that yellow building?\\
210 - Oh, that's Cheez Whiz.
I was reading in bed.\\
211 - Wow. This design is great.\\
212 - You know the way these
condos are laid out,\\
213 - you could spend your entire
life and never have to interact\\
214 - with your idiot neighbors.\\
215 - Oh, and look
at the street names.\\
216 - Orange Grove Avenue,
Grapefruit Lane,\\
217 - Pineapple Road, it's
like living in a fruit salad!\\
218 - Anyway, I couldn't
help but notice,\\
219 - they got 200 brand-new
beachfront homes,\\
220 - each with a dock, but no
bait shop within five miles.\\
221 - - You can fish
of your own pier?
- Uh-huh.\\
222 - That means you don't have to get
your lines tangled up with some dumb ass\\
223 - who doesn't know
what they're doing.\\
224 - You're the one who invited me.\\
225 - Ah, you guys should move
down there, too.\\
226 - Red! Red, you could run
the bait shop with me.\\
227 - Ah, I don't think so, Bob.\\
228 - Kitty and I aren't ready
to leave Point Place.\\
229 - Okay, then. While I'm sitting pretty
there on Orange Grove Avenue,\\
230 - you guys can enjoy the drive
past Slaughterhouse Way.\\
231 - Well, that's not fair, Bob.\\
232 - It's only named that because that
way leads to the slaughterhouse.\\
233 - I think you're really
gonna like living here.\\
234 - So let's take the tour shall we?\\
235 - This area over here with the
underpants is the laundry annexe.\\
236 - Oh, over here is the gym.
Membership included.\\
237 - And through that door is
the bathroom/library,\\
238 - although currently all we have
to read is a Sports Illustrated\\
239 - and a bottle of Prell.\\
240 - - You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.\\
241 - It's just weird, you know.\\
242 - Moving in with someone.
But great. Weird, but great.\\
243 - You know, like midgets.\\
244 - There's nothing to worry about.\\
245 - Oh, and the closet's
really full,\\
246 - but you can just hang anything
you want on the drum kit.\\
247 - I was gonna use it, but
you know... Impulse buy.\\
248 - Seriously, you okay with this?\\
249 - Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine.\\
250 - Then here you go,
I made you a key.\\
251 - Put your name on the mailbox. So I
guess we are officially living together.\\
252 - Uh-huh.\\
253 - - Nice.
- Hey, there he is.\\
254 - Donna, this is Pickles.
Pickles, meet Donna.\\
255 - She's your new mommy.\\
256 - Hi, Mommy.\\
257 - Yeah, um, I gotta go.\\
258 - Chick magnet, my ass.\\
259 - Wow, man. The stuff
you said to Jackie...\\
260 - So mean and hurtful.\\
261 - I only wish I'd said it myself.\\
262 - Well, I'm glad she's gone.\\
263 - I've never felt so happy
about anything in my life.\\
264 - What did I do?\\
265 - Jackie was in love with me
and I let her go.\\
266 - And now all I have
is an empty apartment\\
267 - and the scent of her perfume
on my boxers where I sprayed it.\\
268 - Don't worry, man.
You're doing the right thing.\\
269 - I know you want
to run after her,\\
270 - but as your friend,
I'm not gonna let you.\\
271 - Jackie, I'm coming!\\
272 - Huh, he called my bluff.\\
273 - That Bob and his crazy ideas.
We can never move to Florida.\\
274 - Well, it's easy for him to do.
But we have real ties here.\\
275 - I'm three piggy stamps away
from a free ham at the supermarket.\\
276 - And I've got responsibilities.
Spring's coming up.\\
277 - Who's gonna poison
the new batch of squirrels?\\
278 - Let's move to Florida.\\
279 - You really want to?\\
280 - - Do you?
- If you do.\\
281 - - I do.
- Me, too.\\
282 - - Then let's do it.
- Oh-ho-ho, Red!\\
283 - I am so excited. There is so much to
do in Florida, it'll be such an adventure!\\
284 - No, I just wanna go down there
and kind of sit around till we die.\\
285 - Donna, come on.
Just tell me why you left.\\
286 - I don't know, it all hit me at
once. I just, like, needed some air.\\
287 - Well, if Pickles saying, "Hi,
Mommy" freaked you out,\\
288 - I'll let you in on a little
secret. That was actually me.\\
289 - No, it's just this whole Florida
thing's like really freaking me out.\\
290 - When you asked me to move in, it
seemed like the right thing to do but,\\
291 - when I got there I started
to realize that I'm just doing it\\
292 - 'cause I'm too
afraid to start my life.\\
293 - I used to have, like, plans.\\
294 - What'd you wanna do?\\
295 - Go to college.\\
296 - I got accepted at
Madison last year so...\\
297 - I don't know, I think
it's time I finally go.\\
298 - That's cool. It's only a few hours
away, we can totally make that work.\\
299 - No, you don't understand.\\
300 - This...\\
301 - This just isn't what I want.\\
302 - Oh.\\
303 - So that's it for us?\\
304 - I'm really sorry.\\
305 - Me, too.\\
306 - Kind of sucks.\\
307 - Hey, Donna. Check out
my new Speedo for Florida.\\
308 - Dad, why can't you just buy
a regular bathing suit?\\
309 - No, those make me look silly.\\
310 - - Jackie, there you are.
- What do you want, Fez?\\
311 - I ran all the way
here to find you.\\
312 - My car is in the shop.\\
313 - And you'll be glad to hear that they
are changing the word tiny to large.\\
314 - - Look, I don't care
about any of this.
- Jackie, wait!\\
315 - Look, I didn't mean all
those horrible things I said.\\
316 - You're not ugly,
you're beautiful.\\
317 - Even if you dumped me
after a week,\\
318 - it'd be the best
week of my life.\\
319 - I just want to be with you.\\
320 - Fez, you really, really hurt me.\\
321 - And I thought you were the one person
who would never speak to me like that.\\
322 - You know, you're not
the guy I thought you were\\
323 - and I don't think I
could ever be with you.\\
324 - - But, Jackie...
- No. Goodbye, Fez.\\
325 - Oh, Mr. Forman,
thank God you're here.\\
326 - I just had my heart broken and
I really need someone to talk to.\\
327 - Bob, for the last time, you
can't call our bait shop "Jail Bait."\\
328 - Fine! How about "Hookers"?\\
329 - You know, because you
put the bait on the hook.\\
330 - No.\\
331 - Okay, you got something better?\\
332 - "Red and Bob's Bait Shop."\\
333 - I like it. It's simple, to the point
and I think it will fit on a Speedo.\\
334 - Bob, you put my name
on your crotch, I'll kill you.
\subsection {Episode 21: Love of My Life}
1 - Okay, don't mind us, girls, we
are just prettying up the room\\
2 - because we're showing
the house later today.\\
3 - The listing said "finished
basement" and finished!\\
4 - Well, we're not going
to be selling anything\\
5 - if we don't get rid of
all this clutter,\\
6 - so get the hell out.\\
7 - I can't leave yet.
I told Fez I'd meet him here.\\
8 - He went to
the airport to pick up\\
9 - his best friend from back home.\\
10 - Oh, great, another mocha
skinned weirdo in tight pants\\
11 - who can make any word sound
like boogadaboogadaboogada!\\
12 - You know he is
coming to cheer Fez up.\\
13 - The poor guy hasn't been
himself since you rejected him.\\
14 - You know it's weird, I actually\\
15 - miss his chocolaty stained
fingerprints on my bras.\\
16 - Yeah. Well, you know what?
I don't want to see Fez.\\
17 - I mean, he called me ugly
on the inside and the outside.\\
18 - I'm sorry, but he's just wrong
about the outside part.\\
19 - Holy crap, man!\\
20 - What?\\
21 - Listen to this
letter from my dad.\\
22 - "Dear valued Grooves employee,\\
23 - "your services
are no longer required.\\
24 - "I've sold the chain of stores
to a dry-cleaning corporation\\
25 - "for, frankly,
a butt load of money.\\
26 - "You should see the check,
whooee!\\
27 - "I thank you for your years
of dedicated service.\\
28 - "As of Friday,
you're trespassing."\\
29 - Can you believe this, man?
I'm out of a job!\\
30 - Well, how do you think
Leo feels?\\
31 - Well, probably how
he always feels. Stoned.\\
32 - Everyone, I'd like you to meet\\
33 - my best friend from
back home, Andrew Davis.\\
34 - How do you do? It's so
wonderful to be stateside.\\
35 - So you're Fez's friend
from wherever he's from?\\
36 - Yes, and I know
exactly who you are.\\
37 - You're a frigid,
unpleasant woman\\
38 - who enjoys stomping
on a man's heart for sport.\\
39 - You disgust me, Jackie.\\
40 - I'm not Jackie, I'm Donna.\\
41 - Oh, you are gorgeous.\\
42 - So, you guys are
from the same place?\\
43 - Of course not. He's from
the west side of the island.\\
44 - Hanging out\\
45 - Down the street\\
46 - The same old thing\\
47 - We did last week\\
48 - Not a thing to do\\
49 - But talk to you\\
50 - We're all all right\\
51 - We're all all right\\
52 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
53 - You know what,
enough of this jibber jabber.\\
54 - I brought you folks
a gift from back home.\\
55 - Pretty good gift, eh?\\
56 - Take it easy, though,
a little goes a long way.\\
57 - You know what else
goes a long way, man? A lot!\\
58 - You know what else
goes a long way? Spiders.\\
59 - That little guy made it
all the way\\
60 - from the light bulb to the pipe.\\
61 - Way to go, Mr. Spider!\\
62 - Don't even think
about it, Andrew.\\
63 - Spiders here have
very little meat.\\
64 - Regardless, it's still
so exciting to be in America.\\
65 - It's true what they say.
The streets are paved!\\
66 - I'm starting to
feel weird, guys.\\
67 - My hair is tingly,\\
68 - my palms are sweating
and my pulse is racing.\\
69 - Oh, man, I think I overdid it!\\
70 - Stop jibber jabbering, old boy.\\
71 - I told you
the stuff was pretty strong.\\
72 - Just take a deep breath
and relax.\\
73 - Yes, I'm sure you'll be okay
after a few minutes.\\
74 - Until then, just continue
to sweat and grind your teeth.\\
75 - Or you can do what you usually
do when you've had too much,\\
76 - switch to beer.
Whoa, Hyde, are you okay?\\
77 - Of course I'm okay.
It's you that's not okay.\\
78 - But you're me.
So if you're not okay\\
79 - it means I'm not okay,
which means...\\
80 - I'm going out of my
freaking mind here!\\
81 - You're going to be fine. Do you
guys think I should change my hair?\\
82 - Okay, well,
the house is all set.\\
83 - Mr. and Mrs. Dubois
should be here any minute.\\
84 - Dubois? Kitty, I don't want
Germans moving in here!\\
85 - I think they're French.\\
86 - Yes, and if they buy the house,\\
87 - they'll give it up to the first
German who knocks at the door.\\
88 - Okay, well,
I have to get to work.\\
89 - Are you sure you can show
this house by yourself?\\
90 - Kitty, I showed a Japanese soldier
the inside of his own stomach,\\
91 - I think I can show a house.\\
92 - So, through there is the den,
back there is the kitchen,\\
93 - and upstairs are the bedrooms.\\
94 - Could we see them?\\
95 - Oh, so my word's
not good enough?\\
96 - Well, is there
a bathroom upstairs?\\
97 - No, we just whiz off the roof.\\
98 - In here you got the stove and
the fridge, both still under warranty.\\
99 - Oh, is this the kitchen?\\
100 - No, it's a petting zoo.\\
101 - There's the goat, pony ride.
Oh, there's the dumb ass!\\
102 - In here I built a whole
workbench against this wall\\
103 - so there is plenty of space
for all your tools.\\
104 - Actually I was thinking I
could turn it into a yoga studio.\\
105 - Really, and I was thinking I could
turn your ass into my foot studio.\\
106 - Randy, what are you doing here?\\
107 - Your dad invited me over.\\
108 - I figured if you two talked,
maybe you'd get back together.\\
109 - I mean, it didn't work
for your mom and me\\
110 - but that was mostly because
of sleeping with strangers.\\
111 - Oh, so all of a sudden
Aunt Jenny is a stranger?\\
112 - Donna, I'm sure you probably
don't even want to see me right now,\\
113 - but I never had a chance
to tell you how I feel.\\
114 - Straight from the heart,
my own words.\\
115 - So I made you this mix tape.\\
116 - "Grandma's last words."\\
117 - Oh, I taped over that.\\
118 - You really couldn't hear
over the respirator anyway.\\
119 - Oh, Red, how did it go
showing the house?\\
120 - Why don't you ask all the dumb
asses that came through here?\\
121 - So, poorly then.
Maybe I should show the house.\\
122 - I heard that
you're supposed to make\\
123 - a home feel warm and
friendly and inviting.\\
124 - So you should probably leave.\\
125 - Yeah, I just don't have
the patience for these people.\\
126 - I hate to admit it,
but I wish they were all dead.\\
127 - I'm telling you, Leo,\\
128 - yesterday in the basement I
had the worst trip I've ever had.\\
129 - Hey, I don't care
how bad your trip was, man,\\
130 - you better have brought me
back a snow globe or something.\\
131 - It was a total freak out, man.
I had this hallucination\\
132 - that everyone else
turned into me.\\
133 - It was me and
a whole bunch of mes!\\
134 - Was I there?\\
135 - No.\\
136 - That's it, Leo. You know what,
I'm quitting the circle, man.\\
137 - And I feel really good about it.\\
138 - In fact,
this calls for a celebration!\\
139 - I have no idea what to do.\\
140 - How can I turn down
Jackie Burkhart?\\
141 - I don't even hang up
on wrong numbers.\\
142 - Look, since there's no chance
of anything with her,\\
143 - why are you even sticking
around here any more?\\
144 - Well, where else would I go?\\
145 - Home, old boy! Come home!\\
146 - Home?\\
147 - Yeah, that's a good idea!\\
148 - I'll go back to Brazil and then,\\
149 - I'll catch
a flight home from there.\\
150 - Oh, coming!\\
151 - Oh, hello there,
I'm Kitty Forman.\\
152 - I'm so excited to
show you my home.\\
153 - Okay, now,\\
154 - this is the living room where I
have spent many happy hours.\\
155 - Not "happy hours" like at a bar.\\
156 - Although, I would be lying if I said I
didn't try to start that up around here.\\
157 - No, but I have spent many
wonderful times with the kids in here.\\
158 - Before they moved so very far
away. Oh, sad! Okay, follow me.\\
159 - And this is my kitchen.\\
160 - And this is the table where
Eric would do his homework\\
161 - and Laurie would do her nails.\\
162 - You know, some people
used to call her a tramp\\
163 - but that's not fair, there is
nothing wrong with being friendly.\\
164 - You know, I guess the four of us
will never sit here together again.\\
165 - Okay, let's move on.\\
166 - Now, this is the dining room\\
167 - where we'd have
all our special dinners\\
168 - and Red's mother
used to always tell me\\
169 - my pot roast was too dry. But what
does she know, she's in hell now.\\
170 - You know, I always thought
that I would serve\\
171 - dinner to my
grandchildren in here.\\
172 - Oh, my gosh,
I'm just choking up.\\
173 - Okay and here,
okay, this is the den.\\
174 - Oh!\\
175 - And these are the marks
on the wall where\\
176 - we measured the kids' height
when they were growing up.\\
177 - But you'll probably...
You'll just paint over this.\\
178 - You unfeeling bastards! Yeah!\\
179 - You will get this house when you
pry it from my cold, dead fingers.\\
180 - Oh, in fact, let me show you
one more thing, the door!\\
181 - Hey, Steven, what are you doing?\\
182 - I'm painting this
model I just finished.\\
183 - I have a lot more free time
now that I quit the circle.\\
184 - What, you quit the circle?
What are you, high?\\
185 - I don't do that any more,
Jackie. I don't need to.\\
186 - Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go for a jog.\\
187 - Oh, and if you see
Mrs. Forman,\\
188 - can you let her know that I'll
be making the salad tonight?\\
189 - Oh! It's you.\\
190 - I'm here to get some things belonging
to the man whose heart you broke.\\
191 - Because he's
packing and leaving.\\
192 - Now, who is this Kitty
and where is her underwear?\\
193 - Wait, Fez is leaving?\\
194 - - Hmm.
- Why?\\
195 - Oh, because of you.
He is in bad shape, Jackie.\\
196 - What? He hurt me first!\\
197 - Do you know what he told me?\\
198 - He said that if he could go back
in time and take back five words,\\
199 - those words would be, "Now
you're ugly on the outside,\\
200 - "just like
you are on the inside."\\
201 - That's more than five words.\\
202 - All his words run together,
he doesn't know.\\
203 - So I said to him,
"Why would you want to\\
204 - "take those words back?"
He said to me,\\
205 - so he wouldn't have
to go through life\\
206 - knowing he'd hurt
the woman he loved.\\
207 - Oh.\\
208 - And you broke his heart.
You disgust me!\\
209 - I frankly don't
understand why any man\\
210 - would ever want to be with you!\\
211 - So, want to make out?\\
212 - So, what do you think?\\
213 - Look, I just... I think we both
need to move on with our lives.\\
214 - I'm sorry.\\
215 - Oh, well. I gave it a shot.\\
216 - But you're making a big mistake,
because I am the best thing\\
217 - that is ever going
to happen to you!\\
218 - Really? Still nothing?\\
219 - So, friends then? All right.\\
220 - Hey, guys.\\
221 - What's going on?\\
222 - Steven, we need to talk, man.\\
223 - We're here because we're
your friends and we love you.\\
224 - But ever since you quit
the circle, you've changed.\\
225 - I mean, what's this I hear
about you eating a vegetable?\\
226 - Look at you. Your eyes
are clear, your shirt is clean.\\
227 - I hardly recognize you.\\
228 - You have
a problem with drugs, man.\\
229 - I don't have a problem!
I can start any time I want!\\
230 - Oh, yeah? Then why
don't you start right now?\\
231 - Or don't you have the guts?\\
232 - You guys don't understand.\\
233 - The last time I was in the
circle, I totally freaked out!\\
234 - I know why you freaked out,
man. All your friends are leaving\\
235 - and the record store is closing.
Your life is changing, man.\\
236 - See, it's not the circle that's the
problem. It's that your life is crap.\\
237 - Oh, my God. I've been
using sobriety as a crutch.\\
238 - I need help!\\
239 - We're here for you.\\
240 - Hold out your hands, man.\\
241 - I love you, guys!\\
242 - Red, I have bad news.\\
243 - The people I showed the house
to, they just weren't interested.\\
244 - I have no idea why.\\
245 - It doesn't matter. The clown
who does yoga made an offer.\\
246 - So I said, "It's a deal, you
downward-facing dumb ass."\\
247 - Isn't it great? A month
from now, we'll be in Florida.\\
248 - Yeah. Far away from all
our family and friends.\\
249 - Jeez, Kitty, put it like that,\\
250 - we should leave tonight!\\
251 - Hey, there, son.\\
252 - WB.\\
253 - I guess you heard the news.\\
254 - Yeah.\\
255 - Well, I got some
more great news for you.\\
256 - I bought a Corvette!\\
257 - Good for you, man. You know,\\
258 - you didn't have to come all the
way down here to tell me that,\\
259 - you could have just
sent it in a form letter.\\
260 - "Dear employee,
bought a Corvette. Whooee!"\\
261 - Listen, Steven,
that letter was just for\\
262 - the faceless employees
that I don't care about.\\
263 - Hey, thanks for the letter, man.\\
264 - Look, I wanted to come here
personally to tell you the big news.\\
265 - I'm giving you this store.\\
266 - Yes, you're the proud owner
of the last remaining Grooves.\\
267 - Holy crap, I own this place?\\
268 - Yep.\\
269 - You can even
rename it something more\\
270 - appropriate to this
lily-white community.\\
271 - You can call it Rhythmless
or Snap at the Wrong Time.\\
272 - Wow, man!
It's, like, the nicest thing\\
273 - any one of my dads
has ever done for me.\\
274 - You know,
it just goes to show you,\\
275 - if you sit on your ass long
enough, good stuff will happen.\\
276 - Yup! That is some good stuff.\\
277 - I've missed you, Hyde.\\
278 - Just like they always say,
"Hey, Leo, how's it going?"\\
279 - Son, if this is how
you're going to run\\
280 - this store now that it's yours,\\
281 - I got to tell you, I'm going to
be stopping by a lot more often.\\
282 - Oh, Fez, I'm so
glad you're still here.\\
283 - Yes, I wanted to
take one last look\\
284 - at the basement before I leave.\\
285 - Look, Fez, Andrew told me
what you said.\\
286 - And now that I know,
I can't let you leave.\\
287 - I'm sorry, Jackie,
it's too late. I'm leaving.\\
288 - And there's nothing anybody
can say to get me to stay.\\
289 - I want to be your girlfriend.\\
290 - - I'll stay.
- You will?\\
291 - Yes! But I don't want to be
just some rebound for you.\\
292 - And I need to know that\\
293 - you're not going to leave me
when something better comes along.\\
294 - Fez, there is no one
better for me than you!\\
295 - I'm just sorry that it took
me so long to figure that out.\\
296 - You really mean that?\\
297 - Of course!
Fez, I want to be with you.\\
298 - And I'm so happy that
we can finally be together.\\
299 - Wow!\\
300 - I've been waiting so long
to hear those three words.\\
301 - Man, I can't believe
I'm not going\\
302 - to be around to
see you two together.\\
303 - It's going to go
one of two ways.\\
304 - It could be
a disaster or a catastrophe.\\
305 - Blah, blah, blah! You always say
you're leaving, but you never do.\\
306 - I am serious, I'm finally
going to get out of this town\\
307 - and do something with my life.\\
308 - Eric called, he's coming home!
He's coming home!\\
309 - Yeah, you're not going anywhere.\\
310 - So you grew up with Fez, huh?\\
311 - You know, we've been wondering
something for a long time.\\
312 - Where the hell
are you guys from?\\
313 - Isn't it obvious?\\
314 - Okay, just tell us
what's the name\\
315 - of your country?\\
316 - Well, that depends
on whether you ask\\
317 - the British or the Dutch.\\
318 - Okay, so what if
we ask the British?\\
319 - Oh, no, no, no, no!
They wouldn't tell you.\\
320 - They hate us.\\
321 - So, what if we ask the Dutch?\\
322 - Oh, who can understand
a word they say?
\subsection {Episode 22: That '70s Finale}
1 - Man, the last day of the '70s.\\
2 - You know, thinking back\\
3 - it's like one big blur.\\
4 - You're welcome.\\
5 - You know, Donna,
it kinda sucks that\\
6 - you're leaving
for college today.\\
7 - I mean, I kinda wanted
to ring in the new year\\
8 - by throwing out all your
corduroy boy-pants.\\
9 - Well, classes start on Monday
and Eric gets back at five,\\
10 - so I just wanna like\\
11 - get out of here
before all the drama.\\
12 - Wait a second.\\
13 - If you're actually going,\\
14 - then who's going
to be the recipient\\
15 - of Fez's traditional
midnight feel-up?\\
16 - Well, I was thinking that Fez
will be feeling up Jackie.\\
17 - I mean, she's his new victim.\\
18 - I mean, girlfriend.\\
19 - Oh, I don't know.
Jackie and I haven't even\\
20 - had our first official kiss yet.\\
21 - Yeah, it's been a little hard
making the transition.\\
22 - Yeah, I don't know
what to do because\\
23 - now that she's
not pushing me away\\
24 - and saying, "Get off,"
it's just awkward.\\
25 - Wait a second. Why are we
wasting our time talking about this?\\
26 - Donna's leaving town,
it's the end of the decade,\\
27 - we should be doing
something awesome, man.\\
28 - Something we have
never done before.\\
29 - Or this.\\
30 - Hello, Wisconsin!\\
31 - Wow. Wine at 11:30, huh?\\
32 - Did you run out of bourbon?\\
33 - Well, I am just
a complete wreck.\\
34 - I've decided I don't
wanna leave Wisconsin.\\
35 - Did you tell Red?\\
36 - Well, I've been
trying to but he's just,\\
37 - he's so excited about Florida.\\
38 - Oh, but I've been
dropping hints.\\
39 - I told him that sunshine
makes people whistle\\
40 - because I know
how much he wants to\\
41 - punch those people in the face.\\
42 - Steven, here's a check for you.\\
43 - It's for all the rents
you've paid over the years.\\
44 - I put it into a savings account\\
45 - so you'd have something
to get you started.\\
46 - Whoa! This will buy me
a monster bag of...\\
47 - Marshmallows.\\
48 - Yeah, well,
you're gonna need a place\\
49 - to live now that
we're moving to Florida.\\
50 - Boy.\\
51 - It's gonna be
strange selling the house.\\
52 - That's true.
Plenty of warm memories.\\
53 - You morons just hung
vacancy signs on your asses\\
54 - and my foot's
looking for a room.\\
55 - You know, I ought to vandalize
your ass with my foot.\\
56 - Sleep tight and don't let the
bedbugs put their foot in your ass.\\
57 - How'd you like to own a
little bit of my foot in your ass?\\
58 - How about I drive my foot
into this thing called your ass?\\
59 - You know, we could call in a
specialist to find my foot in your ass.\\
60 - My foot is about to
drill a hole in your ass.\\
61 - And you are about to read
a book that my foot wrote.\\
62 - It's called
"On the road to in your ass."\\
63 - Did you ever actually do that
with your foot?\\
64 - Once. On Iwo Jima.\\
65 - I can't talk about it.\\
66 - I love this song.\\
67 - Yes. It's perfect for
our first real kiss.\\
68 - What?\\
69 - - Stop it.
- You smiled first.\\
70 - Well, I was thinking
about Tootsie Rolls.\\
71 - Fez, we're forcing this.\\
72 - Our first kiss has to be
romantic and spontaneous.\\
73 - And as a guy, it's your job
to completely plan that out.\\
74 - I hate being the guy. And
not just because of this.\\
75 - The shoe selection is awful.\\
76 - Oh, Mrs. Forman.\\
77 - I have here something that might
make Red reconsider about moving.\\
78 - Oh, my God.
Packers season tickets.\\
79 - Red has been on that
waiting list forever.\\
80 - Yeah, my grandfather
was on that list for 30 years.\\
81 - When the tickets finally came
he was 90 years old.\\
82 - He ate them.\\
83 - How did you get these?\\
84 - I used the cash
that Red gave me.\\
85 - Oh, I would hug you, but
I know you don't like that.\\
86 - Thank you.\\
87 - You're such a good boy.\\
88 - All right,
Mrs. Forman, that's enough.\\
89 - I'll say when we're done.\\
90 - Jackie wants our first kiss
to happen somewhere romantic.\\
91 - I wish I could bring her
here but this place is ruined.\\
92 - "Michael plus Jackie."\\
93 - It's like going on
after Sinatra.\\
94 - Yeah, we've had some
good times up here, man.\\
95 - My favorite thing was
watching how people got down.\\
96 - My beer!\\
97 - This is a dangerous spot.\\
98 - There you guys are.\\
99 - Kelso!\\
100 - Hey, man, when did you get back?\\
101 - Man, come on. I'm not going to
spend New Year's without my friends.\\
102 - Come on. Besides, it's
like the turn of the century.\\
103 - It's so good to see you.\\
104 - Did you just kiss my ear?\\
105 - A little.\\
106 - I liked it.\\
107 - Oh, I'm so psyched, man,\\
108 - I got this, like,
four-foot bottle rocket\\
109 - and I'm gonna,
like, tie it to my arm\\
110 - and light it and just
blast into the future!\\
111 - Hey, you guys.\\
112 - I just thought of the perfect
way to put the '70s to bed.\\
113 - What do you say the three of us\\
114 - jump off this thing
one last time together?\\
115 - You're reading my freaking mind.\\
116 - All right, you guys ready?\\
117 - Okay.\\
118 - One, two...\\
119 - Wait, wait.\\
120 - I know how this works.\\
121 - You're gonna say three and I'm
gonna be the only one that jumps.\\
122 - Well, if it makes you feel any
better, why don't you do the counting?\\
123 - Yeah, that way we all
have to jump. All right.\\
124 - Here we go.\\
125 - One,\\
126 - two, three!\\
127 - I just can't
wait to see my Eric.\\
128 - I wonder what he'll look like?\\
129 - I'm going to go out
on a limb and say...\\
130 - Skinny.\\
131 - - Hey.
- What the hell, man?\\
132 - I thought you left for school
like three hours ago.\\
133 - I just want to see Eric
one last time, you know?\\
134 - Show him that even though
he broke up with me that I'm fine.\\
135 - Mmm-hmm.\\
136 - Or maybe it's 'cause
you still love him.\\
137 - You are so off.\\
138 - - Oh, he's here.
- Oh, my God, how's my hair?\\
139 - - Where's Eric?
- The genius missed his flight.\\
140 - I circled
the airport so many times\\
141 - that my finger actually hurts
from flipping people off.\\
142 - This is so typical of Eric.\\
143 - I let myself get all excited and
then he doesn't even show up.\\
144 - You know, Mrs. Forman,
I'm sorry, but your son\\
145 - is an inconsiderate jerk and
I'm so glad I'm through with him.\\
146 - Yeah, things are
going great in Chicago.\\
147 - I even taught my baby
daughter how to say, "Burn."\\
148 - She doesn't use
it right, though.\\
149 - I get her a lot more
than she gets me.\\
150 - Hey, you still doing security
at the Playboy Club?\\
151 - Yeah. I got promoted
to supervisor.\\
152 - I'm the guy who says,
"Don't touch."\\
153 - Can you believe that? Me!\\
154 - Hey, speaking of hot chicks,
what's going on\\
155 - with you and that
stripper wife of yours?\\
156 - Not good, man. She's gone.\\
157 - Apparently she's not the
sweet, innocent little girl\\
158 - she pretends to be
at the start of her act.\\
159 - That's bad news. I totally
would've done it with her.\\
160 - Man, Hyde,
that was right on the bone.\\
161 - My arm's all tingly.\\
162 - Just like your
wife would have been\\
163 - if I would have
done it with her.\\
164 - Oh, I miss this.\\
165 - - Moron.
- Ow, ow, ow.\\
166 - Please!\\
167 - Remember that time
you shot me with a BB gun?\\
168 - I still have the BB stuck
underneath my skin.\\
169 - I like to play with it
sometimes when I get bored.\\
170 - Just like I would
have done with your wife.\\
171 - Awesome, my tooth is loose.\\
172 - Okay, Jackie.\\
173 - I think I figured out
why we haven't\\
174 - been able to
have our first kiss.\\
175 - We have too much
history together.\\
176 - So, I thought that tonight
it would be romantic\\
177 - if I rewrite some
of that history.\\
178 - Look!\\
179 - Oh, crap! It was dark.\\
180 - Fez, this really
shouldn't be this hard.\\
181 - Look, I just want everybody
to know how much I love you.\\
182 - I always have.\\
183 - That was really nice.\\
184 - Yeah, you have
a really strong tongue.\\
185 - Yeah.
It's from all the talking.\\
186 - Just when I thought
I can't like Florida any more,\\
187 - they reinstate
the death penalty.\\
188 - Red, you are not gonna
believe what just came for you.\\
189 - My Packer tickets.\\
190 - I know. Isn't it terrific?\\
191 - Fifth row.\\
192 - You can hear the knees
blowing out from there.\\
193 - I can't believe
I have to give them away.\\
194 - What?\\
195 - I know how much you're
looking forward to Florida.\\
196 - I wouldn't do that to you.\\
197 - Red, I don't want to move.\\
198 - What?\\
199 - Well, I was gonna tell you, but
ever since we decided to move\\
200 - you've been so happy and
smiley and you're never that way\\
201 - except for when you kill a deer.\\
202 - Red, this is my home.\\
203 - I don't wanna leave.\\
204 - Kitty, we don't have to go
anywhere. I don't care where I live,\\
205 - as long as I'm with you.\\
206 - Really?\\
207 - Of course.\\
208 - Red.\\
209 - I love you.\\
210 - Oh, I love you, too.\\
211 - I was talking to the tickets.\\
212 - - Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.\\
213 - If you're looking for Forman,
he's still not here.\\
214 - I'm not here to see him.\\
215 - I just wanna get drunk and ring
in the New Year with my friends.\\
216 - Oh. Well, in that case,
welcome aboard Wasted Airlines.\\
217 - Should you
experience a loss of buzz,\\
218 - a beer will fall into your hand.\\
219 - Please make sure
to drink that beer\\
220 - before helping
small children with theirs.\\
221 - Everybody,
we have an announcement.\\
222 - We've decided
not to sell the house.\\
223 - We're going to stay
in Point Place.\\
224 - Hey, that's so weird, man. I was
just thinking of moving to Point Place.\\
225 - Well, I am just...\\
226 - I'm just so happy we're staying
because I would miss you so.\\
227 - Like Fez, the way
you and I have tea and\\
228 - make fun of male ice-skaters.\\
229 - And Jackie, you're such a doll.\\
230 - I don't even mind
your backhanded compliments.\\
231 - Oh, Mrs. Forman,
you're my favorite old lady.\\
232 - Oh, and you too, Leo.\\
233 - You always make my day\\
234 - when you wave and smile hello,\\
235 - even if you are
urinating on my mailbox.\\
236 - Oh, and Bob.\\
237 - No matter what I cook,
you can't pass it up.\\
238 - Kinda like you can't pass
up a woman's rear end\\
239 - without yelling, "Whoo-hoo!"\\
240 - Just being polite.\\
241 - And Steven.\\
242 - My second son.\\
243 - I adore you.\\
244 - But you know,
now that we're staying,\\
245 - maybe you could
shave your moustache\\
246 - because, honey, you look like
a 40-year-old male prostitute.\\
247 - And Donna, sweetheart.\\
248 - No matter where you go, I will
always love you like a daughter.\\
249 - I am so sorry things didn't
work out with you and Eric.\\
250 - I think I need some air.\\
251 - So, speaking of daughters,
has anyone seen Laurie?\\
252 - Now listen, Bob,
I know that you were\\
253 - counting on me for
the bait shop and all.\\
254 - Hey, you gotta do
what you gotta do.\\
255 - I'm a big boy.
I can make it on my own.\\
256 - I'm gonna miss you so much.\\
257 - Wow, you're getting really
good at this kissing thing.\\
258 - It's magical.\\
259 - I couldn't ask
for anything else.\\
260 - So when do we
get to second base?\\
261 - Oh, Mr. Forman, can I light
this off in your house?\\
262 - Sure and then I'll light
my foot off in your ass.\\
263 - And that, my friends,
is the last\\
264 - "foot-in-ass" of the decade.\\
265 - Cheers.\\
266 - Michael,
it is so good to see you.\\
267 - The girls in the emergency
room were just asking about you.\\
268 - You know, it's like
I've been gone for so long,\\
269 - I almost forgot
you're a hot mom.\\
270 - Oh!\\
271 - You know what else is hot?
My foot when it's in your ass.\\
272 - Look at that.
He had one more in him.\\
273 - Won't you let me
walk you home from school?\\
274 - Won't you let me
meet you at the pool?\\
275 - Maybe Friday I can\\
276 - Get tickets for the dance\\
277 - And I'll take you\\
278 - Happy New Year.\\
279 - Eric.\\
280 - I'm sorry I'm late.\\
281 - I caught the last flight out.\\
282 - So...\\
283 - Awkward.\\
284 - So how are you?\\
285 - I'm good.\\
286 - I start college next week.\\
287 - Oh.\\
288 - - That's awesome.
- Yeah.\\
289 - So what, you just came
back here for New Year's Eve?\\
290 - Look, Donna...\\
291 - When I left, I was so positive
that I was doing the right thing.\\
292 - But now
I've been gone so long...\\
293 - Eric, things are
a lot different now.\\
294 - I know.\\
295 - It's just, Donna, I thought
about you every day.\\
296 - And you know what? It
turns out that Red was right.\\
297 - I am a dumb ass!\\
298 - Donna,\\
299 - I'm sorry.\\
300 - So, uh, sounds like there's
a party going on in there.\\
301 - Yeah, there is. Your
mom's like really drunk.\\
302 - No, really?\\
303 - Yeah, I don't know
if I'm ready for all that.\\
304 - I wish there was just some
way to take the edge off.\\
305 - Edge, you are officially off.\\
306 - Eric, I have
the most incredible news.\\
307 - I have kissed
Jacqueline Burkhart.\\
308 - Yeah, Fez, I have
some incredible news, too.\\
309 - So has everyone else.\\
310 - I think it makes total sense
that Fez ended up with Jackie.\\
311 - She started out
with me, the Ferrari.\\
312 - And then she went to Hyde, the
Mustang, and now she's with Fez.\\
313 - Who's like
a donkey pulling a cart\\
314 - full of brightly-colored
Mexican blankets.\\
315 - Oh, hey, Kelso, I almost forgot.\\
316 - I got you something from Africa\\
317 - for your daughter. Check it
out. A genuine plastic rhino-horn.\\
318 - This is awesome.
Look, guys, I'm a rhino!\\
319 - Guys, I think it's time we
honor all the brain cells\\
320 - that survived the '70s.\\
321 - Despite our best efforts, some
of those bastards pulled through.\\
322 - Tonight, they're going down.\\
323 - Die, brain cells, die!\\
324 - And you're next, liver.\\
325 - Hey, did you guys hear about
that car that runs on water?\\
326 - It's got a fiberglass air-cooled
engine and it runs on water, man!\\
327 - It's like we never run out of
things to talk about down here.\\
328 - I knew you burnouts
would be down here.\\
329 - You guys, it's almost midnight.\\
330 - Mrs. Forman is
pouring the champagne.\\
331 - Hey, guys, last one up the
stairs has to call Red a dumb ass.\\
332 - Oh, man.\\
333 - Ten, nine, eight, seven,\\
334 - six, five, four, three,\\
335 - two, one!\\
336 - It's important to me\\
337 - That you got to have freedom\\
338 - 'Cause I never want to make
you change for me!\\
339 - Boy, we're good.\\
340 - We are really good.
